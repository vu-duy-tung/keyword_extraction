When my wife responded with a yes we were thanked for coming in. Got a run down of the days special. We order 2 croissants with swiss cheese and 2 plain. We took them to go because we were there for the Cars & Coffee event. Needless to say we didn't eat because of looking at the cars and talking to people. Finally got around to eating one with cheese about an 1 1/2 later and it was still amazing. Of course it would have been even better eating right away, but it was still soo good. This is a must return for us.",

I got The Pesto (pictured) with an iced green tea and he got The Curry with a peach smoothie. Our total came to around $25 and I thought it was a bit pricey.  The people are very nice and professional and they make their customers feel at home. The miss at the counter broke down the menu for us because it was our first time. The ambiance is nice as well and it gave the feeling of \"lay back and relax\".   The Pesto was amazing. The baguette was nice to the crunch and the rest of the sandwich fell into place. I had a bite of The Curry and that was even more amazing.   I recommend this place to people if they're looking for good food with good company.",

    "text": "I live in California and was in town visiting family.  This place sparked my interest being the only joint in Las Vegas on Yelp's Top 100 List.  I had to visit!  We arrived at 2pm on a Friday (because I hear lunch is crazy busy) and there were still quite few people dining inside and outside the cafe.  It is True-The owner Olivier takes his time to explain menu items if you have any questions.  I could feel that he loves being there.  We had the special of the day: The pork loin sandwich - tender slices of pork with a creamy sweet sauce, mushrooms, shaved parmesan, baby spinach and tomato on an extremely well made baguette (crispy crunchy exterior texture, soft interior).  Absolutely delectable.  The chocolate tart and pear tart were very delicious as well.  I'd like to come back to sample the quiche (they ran out) and the rest of the menu :-D.  Seriously it was so good that it prompted me to write a review (not that they need it).  This place is just phenomenal!  Merci beaucoup Olivier and staff!",

My second visit was less than okay due to the staff completely forgetting my order and waiting over 30 minutes for a sandwich togo. Mistakes happen, but it wasn't very busy at the restaurant. The staff apologized though and gave me a free pastry so all is forgiven! Make sure you check out their soups of the day because holy guacamole is the Normandy soup BOMB!",

Take note gluten allergy suffers. Phenomenal customer service and the affordability is in a word - awesome.  As some yelpers know this place is slightly harder to locate in a office park - but it's a great location and both the indoor/outdoor layout is relaxing.  Everything is good. In France chefs can be measured by the quality and consistency of their food. The sandwiches are very well done - the soups are fantastic.  You are gonna want to try everything - enjoy",

So for $8.59 I got a 6 inch tough to chew grilled sandwich which had no flavor at all. Like none! So disappointed. Wasn't worth the money or my time. Seemed like a good place to sit and eat though!  Not a place where you order food to go ,for sure! Too bad I didnt take a picture of that sandwich in a paperbag. Didnt look tempting at all, to even think of taking a picture, contrary to all the other pictures seen here.",

I've been inviting a steady stream of co-workers to come lunch with me at BC.  Lunch doesn't get any better than this.  My current lunch time fix involves an order of the Moroccan sandwich, which comes with a choice of chicken or eggplant.  I am by no means a vegetarian, but on this sandwich I actually prefer the eggplant due to the moist, tender texture.  If I'm feeling splurgey, then I grab a 'Real' coconut water to pair, which is as close to cracking open a coconut as you're gonna get.    Lunch time is hopping, but somehow we always manage to find a table, as long as you don't mind sitting outside.",

    "text": "Talk about diamond in the rough one that might be an adventure too get too but once you do. You will have nothing but found memories of walking the streets of Paris (not so much street but get my drift) and walking into Cafe smelling fresh baked pastries, daily soups, and fresh baked bread most notable baguettes. The irony is this gem always been in my backyard neighborhood. Shout out too my beast training partner Suzy H for showing me this gem after our beast bike ride not think of better place too refuel!!!   Unfortunately the only thing with this gem is words out. So we were very lucky too find spot too sit down for lunch at prime time 12. But they do have outside seating and few inside or if anything can always order too go. It SOOO worth the wait!!  I order the chicken pesto sandwich and we shared the granola bowl. I mention many times but really believe no matter sandwich its ONLY as good as the bread. The baguette. It bread from heaven. Truly  only one other experience that had that baguette had that authentic everything on point. It nice crispy crust one that bread the bread away with hands, It nice moist and hot on the inside. I could just go bread crazy eat baguettes all day, Inside find perfectly cooked chicken breast nice moist and hot just like the bread. The pesto spread was awesome! Basil, pine nuts, cheese, and chicken is there better combination for chicken sandwich. Maybe the curry chicken sure bookmark that one for next time. I like the little (literally) salad couple bites. I like the salad dressing on top of it. Not sure if house salad dressing but in any case could have had big salad be happy for lunch. The granola I really enjoyed. It came with fresh cut banana on top and side of milk. We tried it both ways. I prefer it with the milk but either case really good. Suzy nice enough got too try her acai bowl. It first time tried one. It was delicious. All the menu items are under ten dollars for the most part so definitely affordable lunch/breakfast spot.   I love the fact the owner Oliver very much puts his stamp on the restaurant. He constantly on the go walking around asking customers for their input and making sure everyone happy! The acai bowl something relatively new on the menu asking Suzy her thought on it if something that could improve the dish on. I respect any small business owner that always willing too listen too customer feedbacks. You can tell much passion goes into all the dishes at Baguette Cafe. Not just the owner but the entire staff is great! Friendly, helpful, and even if not have the answer they go back too the kitchen get one.   No doubt see myself coming her more often for light lunch, healthy lunch, and really best food for recovery from triathlon training days.....",

The bread was a good crunchy chew to contrast the grilled eggplant and tomatoes.  The side salad was okay.  The Morrocan:  Again, fresh.  The chicken wasn't dry, and the sauce was just the right amount of flavorful.  It didn't overpower the rest of the sandwich.  The baguette was good, as was the side salad.  Watermelon lemonade:  Perhaps, my favorite thing from what we ordered.  It wasn't too sweet, and was refreshingly natural.    SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE:  The entire staff was warm and friendly!  We were catered on much more than I expected for a quick sandwich shop.  It's a small inside area with some outside seating.  You can tell that they really take pride in offering fresh ingredients and making them shine on your palette.  They don't serve soda (at least fountain style)and I love that.  It's speaks to the integrity of what they do here.",

This dude is excited to talk about his food and you just gotta love that! I had the bleu brie sandwich which is amazing. The bread is fresh and soft but with that perfect chewy texture. The chicken was moist and tender. With the thick slices of cheese and thin, crispy apple slices, it all just comes together for a super tasty sandwich. If you've got room after, you have to try one of the chocolate tarts with fresh whipped cream...crazy good!  Baguette Cafe is a must try spot. It's a tad on the pricy side but everything is fresh and worth it. Rumor has it that a new spots opening with weekend hours...I sure hope that's True cause I'll be there the first Saturday they're open! ;)",

Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years.   We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center.   Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black.   The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service.   I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.  I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them. I will be back to try more and try a specialty drink next time now that it's near places we frequent.",

Seating available inside and outside.   Past few times I have tried this place, it is the owner who has been taking my order. SUPER friendly and really knowledgeable... think i remember someone telling me he is a school trained chef? ANYWAY. Very nice greeting and always suggests their daily specials. OH also another note about this guy.. He will secretly take note of your name if you pay by credit card, and he will give a personalized good-bye as your leave ! very surprised ! Also ! they do not do numbers or what not to \"signify\" where the order goes. If you tell them where you are sitting, it will get to you in a timely manner.   One of their most popular sandwiches is the Chicken Curry Sandwich. Past 2 times, that is what i have ordered. Spice level made to your desire. Moist chicken, melted cheese, and a nice yellow curry sauce super flavorful all in a nice toasted ciabatta-like bread.   Both times that i have sat at the restaurant, i have paired with my sandwich, a hot Mocha Rocha. HUGE cup (with a tiny handle) topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce and whipped cream (if preferred). Nice flavor. Not too sweet, not too strong (for the not-so-much coffee drinkers)   The other time, i ordered a pork loin sandwich. I actually forgot what the sauce is but it pairs with the moist cooked pork loin really well. Shaved fresh Parmesan cheese, organic spinach, and tomatoes. Wonderful combination in a toasted bread.   Very nice atmosphere and good tasting food. Really do plan on coming back later in the year, when the weather is SLIGHTLY warmer and sit outside to enjoy the sun while either working or reading a book. been searching everywhere for a NICE place to hang out on a clear sunny day (one of the few very lacking things in this city)",

Warning, this is not a coffee house where you can get your cup 'o' joe in less than 30 seconds.  At first I felt a little guilty when he was explaining their menu items in full detail and asking where we were from, but I quickly realized that the folks line understood that this is a place to relax, engage in a little conversation, get fresh pastries or breakfast and hang for as long as you want.  Rarely, do you get an instant feeling that you are at a place where the owners love what they do and puts ttotal passion into it.  The employees equally present themselves the same way.  I had the feelilng that I was at a small Parisian Cafe in the middle of a desert.",

    "text": "I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.  When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered \"The Prosciutto\" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich \"panini\" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.  Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details.   If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.",

    "text": "Great first experience, great find! My boyfriend and I arrived shortly after noon, so the place was bustling.  Aside from the lucky locals that know about this cafe, I imagine that it is also a popular breakfast/lunch destination for the surrounding business folks, as it is located in a considerably large, fairly occupied plaza.    We approached the counter and browsed the menu for a few moments when we were warmly greeted by Olivier.  From soups and sandwiches, to drinks and desserts, he wasted no time in explaining everything thoroughly, including several vegetarian options.  Olivier's knowledge and passion about the menu made him easily identifiable as the owner, and we did not hesitate in going with his recommendations.    I ordered the Morroccan Chicken [sandwich] and an organic, non-sweetened, pomegranate iced tea.  My boyfriend got the Curry Chicken [sandwich].  Note that if we didn't have a time constraint that day, we would have dined in, but we were in the middle of house-hunting, so we placed our order to go.  It wasn't until we sat down to wait for our food that I began to appreciate everything else about the place.  The cafe is designed simply, yet elegantly, and allows for plenty of natural light, as it has windows in place of walls.  This gives it a pleasant \"sidewalk cafe\" feel, and also keeps them connected to their outdoor seating.  The kitchen and service staff are all in plain sight, and they seem to share Olivier's friendly and hospitable demeanor.    Our order came out timely.  I took my first bite as soon as we got in the car, because I wanted to taste my food while it was still fresh.  The Morroccan sandwich was delicious!  The African spices were just right, and it had enough sauce to add flavor, but not so much that it made the bread soggy.  Speaking of which, the bread was perfectly toasted.  After cleansing my palate with my pomegranate iced tea, I took a bite of the Curry sandwich.  It was excellent too (and this is from someone that can get pretty fussy about curry)!  It reminded me of one of my favorite French-inspired, Vietnamese dishes --a spicy curry with a baguette on the side.  I imagine both sandwiches to be just as good if they were prepared vegetarian, which replaces the chicken with grilled eggplant, and am looking forward to trying this at my next visit.    I already had a feeling while I was looking at the menu, but was further convinced after trying the food, that Baguette Cafe uses quality, hand-picked ingredients.  This is one of my favorite types of places--a place that reminds us that food can be wholesome and tasty at the same time.  I'll be back soon!",

We ordered the following:  A bowl of Shrimp Bisque -  unfortunately the cafe only had enough for 1 cup, but they quickly offerred a cup of cauliflower soup on top of the cup of shrimp bisque, for the price of a bowl.  Win-Win situation here because both were lovely.   A chicken curry quiche - Taste like chicken curry.. yum yum  Eggplant, Prosciutto, tomato pesto and mozzarella Pannini - First off, let me tell you that I was only planning to have a bite of this since my molar isn't doing so well, as in a root canal procedure may be involved type of pain.  However, I ended up finish half of the pannini because it was so AMAZING!  The combination works so well together.    We were so late in the day that only a few muffin and cookies were left.  I was hoping to take a chocolate torte and pain au chocolate to go...aahh, next time.  Yum Yum Yum.",

Tucked in the back of an office complex Baguette Cafe is a wonderful lunch spot and patisserie seemingly lifted from the left bank and deposited in LV.  Olivier and his staff do an amazing job of pushing out quality sandwiches, soups, breads, teas, organic drinks, and wonderful desserts.  Attention to detail with his food is apparent, as quality ingredients and creative preparation are mixed with passion in every offering.  The emphasis is on fresh and simple, with detail down to the off-the-shelf drinks:  Olivier crowed to us about how his ginger soda was so special with natural ingredients.  Get there early for lunch or prepare to stand in line.  Hope that they don't sell out of your favorite items before you get to the register.  Fridays are especially busy so plan accordingly.  My only downgrade is the not-so-scenic office location.  Put Baguette Cafe alongside the Seine or in a more bucolic setting and this place is a lunch place 10.  Tres magnifique!",

    "text": "I had bookmarked Baguette Cafe quite awhile ago based on the stellar reviews and I finally had the opportunity to give it a try today. When we walked in we were warmly greeted by the owner, Olivier. He was super nice and immediately asked if it was our first time. After we told him it was, he gave us a \"tour\" of the menu. We ordered a couple of sandwiches and he took the time to chat with us and learn our names. We sat down and chatted for a few minutes before they brought our food out.   I got the chipotle which consisted of chicken, avocado, bacon, melty cheese, and a delicious chipotle sauce all on a warm baguette. It was stunning! It was served with a small salad with a fantastic house vinaigrette. My husband got the soup and sandwich combo. The shrimp bisque was surprisingly delicious and cheesy. It was served in a cute little mug with a side of croutons. My husband also got half of a Moroccan sandwich. This was a special sandwich which was not featured on the menu, but Olivier was nice enough to tell us about. It had chicken, three types of roasted peppers, creamy goat cheese, and a house made garlic aioli. We were both very happy with our decisions.   We also tried some drinks, since it was a cafe. I had an iced chai tea and was very pleased. It definitely had a subtle flavor, but was exactly what I wanted. My husband got a blended Thai tea, which is such a fantastic idea! It was also very light and refreshing. We decided that we absolutely must try something from the dessert case before we left. Olivier explained that they make everything fresh daily and everything looked amazing. We settled on a slice of the pear tart. It was almost too pretty to eat! It had a very delicate flavor and wasn't too sweet. It was really the perfect treat after our meal.   Overall, this place is fantastic. You get one of a kind service and delicious food for a fantastic price. Everything we tried only came to about $20, can't beat that in Vegas! They work hard to make everything fresh daily and actually get to know their customers. I am still stunned that a place like this actually exists in Las Vegas! Oh we will be back and I am certainly recommending this place to everyone I know.",

What do I mean by real food? Well, first the soups here are all made from scratch; the turkey and chicken on the sandwiches aren't sliced off some glued together super-breast, it is actually identifiable as real meat. There are about thirty other examples of the little things that differentiate this spot from the average restaurant in town but rather than dwell on how lousy the food is everywhere else let me tell you about how great the food is here... I mentioned the soups; there are usually two soups per day; I've tried about 7 of their soups all of which have been awesome. The sandwiches are great and even the iced tea is good. Finally the croissant, oh man, just amazing... This place is hidden in the back of a commercial business plaza, but trust me, it is worth the little bit of hunting that you'll have to do to find it (I got lost the first time I was headed here).",

The Baguette Cafe was so satisfying, it inspired me to write my first-ever Yelp review.  Two proper Illy Lattes in the morning and perhaps the best soup I've ever had--Roasted Red Pepper + Gouda, for lunch (the freshly made Taboule was wicked as well).  Truly exceptional, homemade food, prepared by the people who do food better than anybody on the planet...the french. (sandwiches, salads, quiche, soups...pastry) (great prices too!). The atmosphere is quite comfy.  Service from owner, Olivier, is authentically friendly. And the food...yeah...it's that good.  Call ahead and find out when the chocolate croissants are leaving the oven...! Only potential downside is location, inside a professional park just off West 215 near Durango.  Once you find it...you'll be back.",

Lunch time can get fairly busy so I recommend coming by 11-1130 or after 130 if your schedule is flexible.  The place is owned and managed by very nice and sweet people originally from France so the menu is credible and legit. Service is great. Everyone is always checking up on you if you need anything.   Everything is delicious. Period.   Recommendation- any chicken sandwich, quiche, mushroom soup, desert tarts, and their iced tea.",

The outdoor seating is spacious and cute, I'd love to come back with a friend and hang out for lunch or just coffee and dessert. You can't go wrong with a croissant anything, we got the croissant ham egg and Swiss, croissant and egg, and the veggie quiche. Everything was great, I can't wait until next time!",

If you enjoy travel, and like places with an \"international vibe,\" you will probably enjoy this place! Pictures of Paris, French-speaking customers, eclectic music tracks ranging from rustic guitar rifts, Spanish vocals, to funky electronic, will bring a smile to your face. It was a bit of journey to find it, as it is tucked away, but well worth the effort. The owner/manager/barista (lol, busy guy!), \"Oliver,\" makes you feel welcome right from the start. The coffee is top-notch, I usually get just plain drip with some cream. On the day I went, they were serving beans roasted by Anchois coffee Co FYI. They serve it in big, warm cups, served to your table. Lastly, the food selection is also fantastic. Great breakfast and lunch options. I had an Egg baguette Panini. Delicioso!  They have great wifi now! So they get the 5th star! This place checks all the boxes for me now. I will miss them as I leave Vegas, here is my going away picture...Have a \"Tiru-ific-misu\" journey! Thanks for being an oasis for me in this sometimes overwhelming city. =D",

We had been out on a hike and came here after for breakfast.  With so many delicious times to choose from it took us a few minutes to decide what our feast was going to be.   I got the Cheese Omelet baguette and my daughter got the  Chicken Curry Sandwich.  We decided to share a Quiche Lorraine with a side salad.  We got the Watermelon Lemonade for our drink.     The Watermelon Lemonade was really good.  The Watermelon was the stand out flavor with the lemon flavor being in the background.  Honestly I normally wouldn't have chosen a drink like this but wow was I impressed!  Our order come out pretty quick and we were in for a treat.  The baguettes for both of our sandwiches were so good.  Good bread is so hard to come by and this was a welcome treat.   Of course both sandwiches were delicious.  The omelet was perfect size and fluffy.  Perfectly cooked and really hit the spot.  The Chicken Curry sandwich was really good too.  The curry was spot on.  It added to the flavor but was not overpowering.       The Quiche Lorraine was amazing.  Light and fluffy and so tasty. Many places over cook their quiche but not here - perfection is the way they roll!  The salad was made delicious with the tasty dressing of which I was a could get a bottle of to take home!  I am not going to wait moths to return as I will be back soon to take in more of their delicious food.",

Multiple tables needed to be cleaned off..I was noticing when it took the girl over 10 minutes to put in my order but then had to go get the owners help to ring it in correctly..which is fine) but it was an episode long. They didn't ask whether it was for here or to go. I was planning on eating it there. So I go find a table to relax and sit down and hopefully eat a good sandwich. Then I hear someone yelling, \"Do you want it for here or to go?\" Huhhhhh???? Walk over to me and ask..how about that! Anyway..sandwich came and if you enjoy oxidized avocado you would have enjoyed the sandwich. Soup was shit. Anyway...I'm truly not one to say anything but I'm a Chef and the whole experience was a shit show and the food was not worth any kind of trip there.",

I had the mushroom, apple, walnut and brie sandwich (you can opt for chicken instead of the mushrooms,) and it was heavenly! It came with bleu cheese, but I am not a huge fan, so I told them to go light on it. The right amount of tanginess with creaminess and savor from the mushroom made this heaven in my mouth. My daughter had the 3 cheese with prosciutto, that in itself is a delectable item. There is a small salad on the side and the sandwich portions are pretty large. I also ordered some ice coffee, and from a non-coffee lovers point of view, it was smooth and non acidic. It is down the street from here, I would of never know about this gem, if it wasn't for yelp. Now we can head down here for our cravings for gourmet sandwiches!",

Only thing that helped me to get there that I saw the sign from the freeway many times!  My BF and I both ordered the Grilled eggplant panini with extra turkey added. And for drinks, he ordered iced tea, and for me hazelnut cappuccino.  After we paid, went outside to find table. They were plenty of empty places, but dirty. One after another, all dirty tables. Finally got a table next to the entrance, got napkins and wiped off the table. About 15 minutes later we got served. Everything looked good! I took the first bite, and struggled. Then I realized I am fighting a big piece of paper from my sandwich. Immediately went inside, asked people in line to excuse me to go front. I showed my food to the cashier. He immediately took it from me, and gave it to the cook. The cook said, OH IT'S ONLY PAPER FROM MEAT. I said, okay, but it's not supposed to be served! Cook gave me a dirty look, didn't want to fix the problem. Well, I asked again, WOULD YOU EXPECT ME TO EAT THE PAPER?  Finally the cashier told him to make a new sandwich! I couldn't watch him prepare the new sandwich, I returned to my table. Very soon my food arrived. Honestly, I really lost my appetite! I kind of forced myself to try and eat, since I was hungry. After other customers left from the neighboring tables, the cashier came to us. He apologized, said SORRY many times, apologized for the cook's behavior, too.  Bottom line: IT IS VERY RUDE TO DENIAL ABOUT WRONGDOING! The cook was very rude!  Panini was tasty for the second time. My cappuccino didn't taste hazelnut at all! My BF asked for refills on his iced tea, and the busboy said he doesn't know if it's any refills. Well ... ask someone then! But NO ... he never returned!  I guess I won't return to this place either!",

He advised that he could make any of their drinks with almond milk. I almost did a dance right there in the shop! I ordered a decaf caramel macchiato and it was oh so devine.

I always assumed it would be some typical cafe with subpar food and generic coffee, considering it's location in a cluster of business buidlings. And boy, i was wrong! I was in the area today so i decided to try it out. When we got there, there was a line literally going out the door. We waited about 15 minutes so i would suggest avoiding going there during lunch hour. When we got to the register, we were helped by a guy who was really friendly and informative about their menu. He remembered our names and seemed to genuinely care for his customers.   I got the turkey sandwich and an iced white mocha and my friend ordered the curry chicken sandwich and a funky monkey specialty drink. We were so hungry and being that they were so busy, we knew it would take some time to get to our order so we grabbed a goji bar to munch on. The bar was made from all naural products so i expected it to taste like cardboard but it ended up being SO GOOD! Our sandwiches were also delicious, especially the baguette that they were on.   While waiting for our food, we kept eyeing the peach tart that was in the display case. We ended up giving in and buying a slice and im sooo glad we did! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. It wasnt too sweet and the crust was the best i've tasted in a while!   This place is awesome and i would definitely recommend eating there!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so bad, based on all of the good reviews it received on yelp and a bunch of recommendations I kept getting from my friends. Unfortunately, I just did not have the same experience they had.  At first, everything seemed okay. I was greeted by Oliver, who was very welcoming. I ordered a sandwich (I don't remember the name), a cup of thai curry soup, a chocolate pastry, and a water cup. I expected to wait anywhere between 15-25 minutes considering how busy it was at the time. I waited a whole hour for my food to finally get to my table. That's right, one whole hour. For just one sandwich, a cup of soup, a pastry, and a water cup. That's it.   On top of waiting for about an hour, I saw other customers come in after me and receive their food before me. I went up and asked how much longer for my food because it's been about an hour and one of the workers told me it was coming right up. I saw my receipt, so I know my food was not given to the wrong people/forgotten/skipped. I finally got my food, and it was good, but not worth an hour wait, especially when you notice from people that came in after you were already half way through their meals.   I wanted to speak to someone, and finally one of the workers asked me how my food was. I told her it was good, except for the amount of time I had to wait. I was glad to finally talk to someone who seemed to care about my misfortune, but whoops! Nevermind! Before I even got to elaborate or explain how long I was waiting and how others got their food in a fraction of the time, she was already running back towards to kitchen saying \"sorry for the wait.\" Seriously? If you're going to ask someone about their experience, at least act like you care enough to listen to the whole thing.  Maybe I just came in on a bad day, but regardless, the service should be consistent. I would have appreciated someone taking the time to listen to me, or checking up on me while noticing I was waiting for awhile. Maybe that would give me a reason to come back, but since none of that happened, I don't know how I could ever want to come back.",

Provided of course that you have friends who know how to seriously handle themselves in a kitchen.  Misti Y brought me here for a quick lunch and some work time. Free wi-fi is always a plus and Baguette Cafe provides that. But, they also provide a nice, simple meal as well. I tried a combination of the veggie soup and a crunch salad. Each portion was half sized which meant they were perfect together to provide a whole meal.  The soup was a cream instead of what I expected (I expected more of a broth with whole vegetables cooled in there), but it was a fantastic flavor. The crunch salad was simple and simply delightful - chock full of jicama, carrots, and other such crunchy veggies.  The prices were more than reasonable and if I'm not mistaken you can get a baked good made fresh that day to round out your meal. One note - this is strictly a morning and afternoon spot as I'm fairly certain they close at 5 pm on the weekdays and aren't open on weekends at all.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and I finally had the chance to meet there with some friends! This cafe is pretty close to where I live and it's truly a hidden gem. I missed the exit because it's in a business park, where I wasn't expecting it to be. The indoor space is moderately sized and clean. There are tables outside if you decide to eat outside, I love that there is an option, though the tables are not as clean (which can't be helped, thank you nature). I had the curry chicken grilled sandwich with mild spiciness; it was good, but I wish there was a little more of a curry flavor in it (I suppose I should have asked for it to be spicier). The sandwich also came with a small salad, which was unexpected but really nice! I would definitely come back to this cafe if I were looking for a place to catch up with friends or even craving a good sandwich. Can't wait to try their drinks based on other reviews!",

Baguette Cafe recently popped up on my radar thanks to some stellar ratings. I'm glad to report that Olivier's humble little joint in an unassuming business park next to the freeway... is all that and a baguette (of chips?).  I went there for lunch today. I had read about some amazing soups, so I decided to get a half sandwich and soup combo. For the sandwich, I chose their curry chicken on a baguette. Are you kidding? How could that not be good? But the thing that blew me away was the soup. It was some sort of sweet potato concoction with pureed carrots and some curry spice. It was pretty incredible. In hindsight, that soup was the perfect thing to pair with my sandwich.  If there was one thing to complain about, the portions are kind of small. But that's just my American brainwashing speaking. Honestly, the meal satisfied me completely. I will definitely return.",

WHY: For their tasty French baguettes.  WHAT: My best friend and I decided we needed to have lunch. And since I had heard such great reviews about this place, we decided to go and try it out.  First thing's first, I love Olivier!! Anything he said, I believed! And because he said the Yellow Curry baguette was one I should try, TRY is what I did. And yes, Olivier does it again! Such a great sandwich, with a touch of spice, and a cup of tomato basil soup... This had to be the best lunch I've ever had!  Olivier charmed my friend into trying the Moroccan baguette (which I will have to try next time), and she also fell in love with how well-made the sandwich was.  For dessert, we tried the newly made Peach Tart, which was UHHMAAYYYZIINNNGGGG! It was not too sweet, and just the right amount for both of us.  I'd love to go back and try some of their other baguettes and pastries SOONER THAN LATER. In the meantime, check it out for brunch & tell me how much you LOVE the yellow curry baguette 8).",

    "text": "Talk about a Nevada gem. By far one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas region. Delicious. I want to buy a house here just so I could access this place at a convenient distance.   The cafe is located in a commercial area.  The owner did a good job at making the inside and outside patio area adorable. It has a French ambiance. It is cute.   As you walk in the owner greets you. He is so nice and so helpful. He is warm. His customer service skills is really remarkable.   Everything here is made fresh, and as a customer you have the opportunity to see it. When I got there the owner was taking out  fresh croissants from the oven.   I had half a Moroccan sandwich and half roasted bell pepper soup. Both were fantastic. For both I paid $8.45   I am knocking off a point for their smoothies. I ordered a mango strawberry smoothie. Although it had the authentic taste of mango, it tasted like a frozen snapple. It had a very icy consistency, not smooth or creamy. It was more of a slush then anything. It costs about 4.50. It was disappointing. I definitely wouldn't order that again or recommend it.   Overall I would come back here in a heart beat and bring all my friends I want to try everything ( other than the smoothies)! Looking forward to coming back.",

    "text": "Only my second time here, and a long time coming...but Oliver made it worth the wait...  I have been raving about this place for some time, but don't manage to get out to these parts often.  I am sure everyone would agree a relocation can be bitter sweet considering that the current location does cater to the medical and business district surrounding the area..  Those of us that don't frequent this area suffer while the nearby patrons prosper, although, Oliver makes it worth the drive as well.  If a relocation is in the future, I pray that it's not an expansion unless they can duplicate it enhance the service, otherwise, it's hard to replace the experience.  We stopped in after picking up my fiance's pops from the airport.  Breakfast was on order and we all had a day off what better time to sample over of the great breakfast joints Vegas has to offer.  Our walk from the parking lot included a warm greeting from the maintenance workers outside, uncommon but awesome.  We were then greeted inside and conversed with Oliver again, who provided a passionate overview of the days special offerings.  Everything looks up for the day ahead.  My fiance offered the chicken brie, my pops in law, the breakfast pannini, and myself, the fresh made quiche.  I don't know about everyone else's dish, but the quiche was the best I had.  It was most and flavorful with a good balance of ingredients.  The slice is hefty and a perfect portion to hold me down till lunch rolls around.  I did get to sample the fresh made chocolate truffle croissant twist as well and it was euphoric, considering I'm not much of a sweet tooth.  The ambiance is very welcoming and noticed new decorative art that added a nice touch.  The over sized glossed photography art adorned the walls, but a fee more were needed towards the rear of the eating area.  I believe the art resembled modern French stills.  I dug it and it reminds me of the art in the original Bachi Burger, also priced for gallery sale.  Staff always make you feel at home and when the weather permits, the outside patio provides a refreshing experience.  Don't forget about the coffee selection.  Illy can be a little overwhelming for my taste, since I'm a black coffee person, but think will more than satisfy other coffee aficionados.  I would give this experience an overall 4.5, minus 0.5 for the location, but round it up and what do you get?? A five-star experience and coming from me, that's really saying something.",

I was rung up and rushed away, sitting outside I noticed how dirty the patio furniture has become- really needs to be cleaned! Covered in filth. Overall the customer service was bad (try asking for the WiFi password or order something- the whole thing feels rushed andli you are bothering the staff) and frankly things weren't cleaned. I sat next to a table with a ton of dishes, which was finally cleared off but never wiped done.  Really disappointed this place has changed so much.",

I love their accents!  The sandwich menu looks great!  I'll have to try one upon a return visit to the area.  I intended to try out their coffee.  Seemed standard, didn't blow me away.  I like that they sell beans though; from different countries.  The bakery items seem to be most popular.  Homemade (or in-house).  They sell fast!  I was glad to discover their CHEESECAKE.  So different from ours.  It had a fluff to it and wasn't overpowering rich or sweet.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Simple and nice interior.  Line out the door.  Don't mind standing in it.  Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I'll have to come back.",

Here's the lowdown:  THE GOOD: + customer service + quality ingredients + good portions + affordable prices + lots of vegan and vegetarian options  + the food  THE BAD: - There is no bad. Please revert back to the first line of the review.   Joking aside, this place is really, really good. If you want something light (as in smaller, not healthier), I recommend getting the Croissant and Egg. The croissants are always perfectly flaky, rich, and buttery.  If you want to try the quiche, get the Veggie Quiche. Ask anyone who works here, and they almost always prefer the veggie.  If you want to try a sandwich, get the Pesto with eggplant. Delicious sun dried tomato walnut pesto, avocado, mozzarella, and eggplant on their fantastically crusty baguette.  If you want something sweet, get the Chocolate Twist.   And lastly, grab a cup of soup as a side, because they're always good (and almost always vegan or vegetarian!) You can even ask to Pick Two.  Overall, definitely recommend this place! ~",

My word - when we walked in there I was in love with the cozy setup and lovely smell of bread in the room. Olivier helped us order, as everything on the menu sounded incredible. He is absolutely friendly and even asked for our names and used them once or twice while taking our order.   I went with the Pesto Sandwich with the choice of bacon and chicken inside, as well as a caramel latte. Mom went with Quiche. In maybe less than 8 minutes, our food arrived to the table. Everything was outstanding! What really knocked my socks off was how delicious my latte was! I don't think I ever experienced real coffee like that before. The quiche was yummy too. It was around noon when we were leaving and we noticed the place filling up. Looks like they have a high peak hour!  A little gem in a business lot. Where have I been all this time? I will definitely be back more times!",

Their sandwiches and soups will leave you wanting more. Fresh, clean, and made to order...Baguette Cafe is not only good for their sandwiches, their soups are also a fan to many.  I had their Egg Baguette Panini.  I had mine with the eggs, turkey, spinach, mushrooms, and their tomato basil sauce.  This panini comes with Swiss cheese, but opted to have it taken out.  At first bite, I thought that the bread was the highlight.  Their breads are freshly made in front of you if you're lucky like me, then you get to the substance, which is the turkey and egg.  My goodness...I loved my meal.  I chased my panini with a cup of their chowder.  This was so good too.  Dining inside looks to be a little tough during lunch time since the restaurant is small and the outside seating is minimal.  Plus, seems like everyone else is a fan because there's a line out the door. But don't fret...the line goes by quick and your meal is served in a decent amount of time.

    "text": "This might be the 358th non-filtered review for Baguette Cafe, but it's the first review to mention the organic acai bowl. A favorite spot for almost three years, I walked in this morning with thoughts of fresh croissants, melted cheese, tomato pesto, and omelets, but when I saw a new menu the words acai bowl, I went in that direction. Olivier's super cool mom described the preparation: organic acai blended with almond milk, banana, and a touch of agave, served with granola and sweet pineapple- ananas, as she told me in French. :) Later, Olivier asked how I enjoyed the bowl and mentioned that it was inspired by his Hawaiian vacation-- not Rio, but that's OK. (mental image of Olivier at Carnaval carrying pineapples on his head goes here)  It was different from a traditional acai bowl, but very flavorful and enjoyable. The Amazonian acai was not thick nor overwhelmed by banana. If you prefer a smoothie texture, ask if they can accommodate. The pineapple was perfectly ripe. They carry a selection of organic bottled beverages, and the grapefruit ginger juice paired nicely with the bowl. If I type the word acai one more time, this review will be filtered as Portuguese.  The best soups in Las Vegas are found at Baguette Cafe. I'm looking forward to summer if only for the chilled gazpacho with crunchy granite and whipped creme fraiche. I usually order a half sandwich and soup combo and am satisfied with the portions. The quiche, breakfast pastries, tarts, and desserts are all excellent.  I wish Yelp would implement a filter to ignore any Elitist review that deducts a star because the reviewer thinks Baguette Cafe is hard to find or complains that this family business closes on Saturday and Sunday. Yelp responsibly, or don't be taken seriously. Bonjour!",

I don't remeber exactly the cost but it was pricey for what I got. I then sat there for 15 minutes and people that came in after me were getting their orders before me. I finally get my order which I suspect was sitting on the counter at least 5 minutes and it was heated poorly I mean come on 15 minutes for a semi warm croissant? That's pretty poor. It wasn't very busy either. And the staff gave off an aura of laziness. So overall...poor customer service,poor attention to what they are serving and what appeared to be random favoritism in getting what I ordered = not impressed and will not be returning.",

I work nearby so I often grab breakfast or lunch there. My go to is the parfait which may seem pretty standard but theirs is anything but. It's unflavored yogurt, some kind of jam or preserves for flavor as well as random fresh fruits. The granola they use on top has pepitas in it as well as flax seeds and other crispy delicious goodness. The parfaits are different every time. Sometimes it'll have sliced grapes and strawberries, other times I've gotten banana and watermelon! It's always phenomenal.  For lunch they always have new soups every day, they're always spectacular. Their cream of asparagus soup and gazpacho is my favorite.  I've had a few of their salads and my favorite by far is their Greek. Is a huge salad with black olives, cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta and the Greek dressing is bomb. It also comes with soft, warm pita slices and home made hummus! It's seriously amazing.  the staff is always amazingly friendly and enthusiastic about their jobs.

I gave this cafe 5 stars because the soothing jazz music in the background, excellent service from the employees, and the deliciousness of the food and drinks. We will be back!",

    "text": "I am writing this review while finishing one of the best tarts I've ever ordered here. I am a full believer in having goals, my biggest, is to get through a meal to enjoy dessert! Baguette Cafe makes it extremely easy because their not-super-sweet, sweets, are as beautiful to look at as they are to taste!   I must start with savory! They have a very decent sized menu that includes quiche, breakfast sandwiches, salads, cold sandwiches, grilled sandwiches, and usually 2 homemade soups. And one of those soups is almost always vegan. Today they had Brussel Sprout and Creamy Pumpkin. I opted for Brussel Sprout and it was FANTASTIC. It was savory, creamy, and VEGAN. I would have put money on the fact there was at least cream or chicken stock in that velvety, perfect green soup. I've tried the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious, today I had The 3 Cheese with chicken. I LOVE goat cheese and they put the perfect amount to pair with the tomato basil pesto. I've had The 3 Cheese with prosciutto before as well, next time I'm doing bacon(not actually on the menu, just sounds good)! The sandwiches come with simply dressed mixed greens. If you'd like a heftier salad I recommend the Crunchy Green, it's not often you find jicama in a salad!  Okay, now the tarts!!! They are pretty infamous for the chocolate tart, which is decadent! I've enjoyed an amazing mixed berry and an apricot too. But today I was lucky enough to run into the plum cinnamon tart and the two flavors together is perfect. The crust is made with GREAT butter! If you know anything about baking, especially French treats, you HAVE to use amazing butter. They place beautiful pieces of seasonal fruit in this beautiful egg custard then into this perfectly semi-salted buttery crust. I recommend starting with the crust on this beauty, then working your way to the tip. The only way to make it better is to add a perfect iced americano!   Do yourself a favor and check out Baguette Cafe, their 4.5 star rating tells you this place is every bit as tasty as the reviews say.",

    "text": "My daughter had an early school release today, so we decided to check out this cafe I had been wanting to try for some time. It's a small cafe located right off of the 215 on the gateway. It was lunch hour so it was pretty busy. While we were looking at the menu up at the front, Oliver the owner, greeted us warmly and asked if we had been there before. We said we were newcomers, so he introduced himself and explained the menu. It's a small cafe, but they have so many options to choose from. We got the Curry Chicken sandwich with a Chai Latte, an Egg & turkey Baguette with a White chocolate Latte, and an order of lentil soup. At first we thought the portions looked rather small, but don't let that fool you...it is really filling, very tasty, and reasonably priced. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the soup and the small salads that came with the sandwiches. They were a little on the plain side.   I would definitely come back and try the quiches and the croissants, as that's what I believe they're known for. I can't wait until it starts to warm up outside because they have a spacious patio area outside too. As an added bonus, the owner really enjoys his business. He is proud of it and it shows. Thanks Oliver! Good stuff!",

If you get your drink for here like a tea or coffee, they serve it to you in a huge mug like I've seen in France, and haven't seen since I've been in France. The owner/mother and her son are super friendly. They have a great selection, wish we had something like this back in Michigan. We only found this place after reading about it online about how it's one of the best places to go eat in the country, and I know why now. Can't seem a little pricey for some people, but not for Vegas, cheaper than Carlos bakery in the Venetian, just not the most convenient location. Kind of a ways from town, but near IKEA. Definitely worth checking out.",

They open up the patio seating during the warmer seasons.  They serve healthy French sandwiches and juices.  I've had several of their sandwiches and they've all been excellent.  Portion size is \"just right\" and leaves you with room for dessert.     Partly due to their excellent food, the place is always packed and it's sometimes hard to find a space to sit.  I recommend going during slightly off hours to avoid the lunch rush.",

The people that work here are genuinely upbeat, friendly and really seem to enjoy working here. They had such great camaraderie with each other and their customers which I don't see very often. Great Salad and Sandwich choices, including Vegan options! The Cream of Zucchini and Lemon soup was out of this world! And the sandwiches were killer too ;) All in all, this place is  5 stars all the way and if you're driving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, it's worth taking the time to stop and have lunch here before you get to Vegas, the Strip and all of the over-priced, restaurants for lunch.

That's how good this place is.   Their food is diverse and their flavors are unique. They mesh the flavors of different cuisines together so well that you feel like you're eating all of your favorite foods at once. At least, that's how I felt. :)  Just, come here. Make time. Go out of your way.   The menu is simple. Salads. Sandwiches. Soup. Pastry. Coffee. Along with daily specials that are to die for.   I had the yellow chicken curry panini the other day and I think I visited heaven for a moment. The curry sauce was perfect and there was also mozzarella cheese and other ingredients I can't remember because all I kept saying to myself was, \"this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten.\"   Also, I ate a chocolate twist croissant. The chocolate filling had some type of creamy flavor - oh my goodness. Flaky, soft, fresh and delicious.   Please open on the weekends? Even just one day?  (Edit: I also have to tell you how wonderfully friendly the family/friends are that run this place. I only assume they are friends or related because they seem to really connect and get along well while they are working together and putting orders in. They are terribly nice and do such a great job of explaining menu items and specials. They also asked my name and remembered it! THAT is the type of vibe and welcoming you do not always get - the kind of thing that makes me want to come back: it felt as if I was being welcomed into their home.)",

We think the prices are reasonable, service is very friendly, food is excellent ( just wish their 'salad' was actually more than half a handful of lettuce w/ some dressing!).  If we are ever on that side of town, we swing by now.  If you are seeking truly European food, fresh with simple but delicious texture and taste, this is it!  We live in Henderson and are hopeful they will open a location here (as Olivier said they may).",

    "text": "I discovered this little breakfast place about a year ago. They had great reviews, so I decided to give them a try. The owners are French and Olivier, one of the owners will remember your name after the second visit. Gotta say the way he says David is a little funny. They have the best goat cheese quiche I have ever tasted anywhere! And since I have friends meet me here for breakfast, most of my friends wonder how I can have a goat cheese quiche three times in one week... That's how, cause it doesn't get any fresher or tastier. And so the merry go round goes, as I found it on Yelp, tried it, liked it, passed on to the next reader.",

    "text": "Such an unexpected find in a business park!  Oliver is such a great host to his restaurant.  He makes you feel that he is delighted to have you in and share his amazing food with you.  This is what customer service is all about.  I believe his mother is the one in the back doing the cooking and baking.  She has served us as well, and is super friendly.  The food is excellent and very fresh.  We have never had anything here that we didn't like - in fact, everything from the croissants, to quiche to sandwiches rival those in the tastiest bistros we have been to in Europe.  They must import their butter or something.  I have no idea how the quiche can be that fluffy and the crust can be that flaky.   Start your morning off with an Illy coffee and you're good to go for the day!  I will be back again and again. I just wish they were open on the weekends.",

    "text": "Wow. I'm not the easiest person to impress but this place just has IT. The gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and took his time to explain the choices and other items which aren't on the menu. I went with the three cheese panini with prosciutto. It was incredible. Melty, creamy cheese. The saltiness of the prosciutto. The crispiness of the bread. I was actually full after the first half of the sandwich, but finished it all coz I kept wanting to taste more. The mocha frappe was also very good!   Only thing I can complain about is the hours and location. Which isn't that bad, but them not being open weekends makes it tough for me to make it here. It is also tucked away between several office buildings so it wasn't the easiest to find, or most accessible of locations. But that really has nothing to do with the food or service. 5 stars well deserved regardless of the drawbacks. I will definitely be back :)",

    "text": "I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. After my friend introduced this cafe to me last year, I have been coming back so often that the owner Olivier pretty much knows my name. After I had a taste of their baguette sandwich, I have become a sandwich snob and no other sandwich in the city even compares. How much do I love this place? After moving to the other side of town earlier this year, each month I still drive 11 miles ONE WAY to this place for my favorite chicken curry baguette and cup of soup. It's crazy, but it's definitely worth it.   The menu has breakfast sandwiches, wraps, salads, sandwiches, coffee, drinks, and French pastries. There are 2 soups of the day, and they vary each day depending on what Olivier wants to make. I love his cream of potato soup with truffle oil and butternut squash soup, but I've never been disappointed by any of his other soups. The first time you come here, Olivier will be more than happy to explain to you the items on his menu, and he's always enthusiastic with customers. He wants you to love the food as much as he does. The food is made with love, and I think that's why I like it so much. I would definitely recommend the chicken curry sandwich (it's not on the menu though) and the chicken pesto sandwich is delicious as well.  The cafe is located in the same plaza as a whole bunch of big business buildings so it can be a bit confusing trying to find this place the first time. The cafe is small, with about 5 or 6 small tables on the inside, but there are more tables located outside. I've noticed many of the customers are people who work at the nearby office buildings on their lunch breaks, but there are also many customers who, like me, make the drive for the food and relaxing atmosphere. The cost is a few dollars higher than your regular sandwich, but it's well worth it for fresh baked bread and ingredients.   The only gripe I have (and I've told Olivier this before) is that the cafe is only open until 5:00 pm Monday-Fridays. It makes sense as most of the office buildings nearby operate on the weekdays, but I get mad cravings for my chicken curry baguette and soup on the weekends!",

While it is located in a business plaza in Southwest Las Vegas, it is the best cafe I have been to in town.  The sandwiches are what brought me here, and it is what will bring me back.    The service was very friendly and attentive.  The owner, Olivier, is a UNLV graduate, something we both had in common.  After talking to him for a little while, I found out he has worked as manager at some of the top places on the strip (Aureole, Bouchon, Joel Robuchon).  You could tell that he knew his food, because the sandwich I had was top notch.   One of his suggestions was the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich, so I thought that sounded great.  They brought out the sandwich on a glass plate, with a real fork.  It even came with a small side salad, which was very nice.  I think next time I may also try one of their soups.    I will be going back to Baguette Cafe soon and often, and suggest that you go too!",

And yes, contrary to other reviews, they do have baguettes, that's what our panninis were made with. They aren't the two foot long variety if that's what you're after.

It was love at first sip. And back to the man, I'm not quite sure of his name but he's so welcoming and always pays great attention to his customers. I wish they were open on weekends!!!!

The sandwiches are perfectly sized so you don't waste any food. We then decided to take a tart to go and an acai bowl to go. They were both so good. We also had a chocolate twist and a croissant the day before and they were delicious. There is a lot to be said about a restaurant that can sustain itself with good values and good customer service.

    "text": "I'll admit that I'm a softee when it comes to rating locally-owned businesses. I tend to round up. But, if any local small business deserves a high rating it's this place. I've seen the other 5 star Yelp reviews for Baguette Cafe and was really skeptical that a small place in an office park could be that good, but it is.  I've been there a few times in the last 2 weeks and the food I've tried ranged from good to excellent. What makes it so good are the fresh ingredients and the spreads and soups that are made from scratch. The prosciutto sandwich with mixed greens and walnuts had a home-made celery spread. I've had it twice and the first time it was very good, the second time the prosciutto was too thick and salty.  On another occasion I had the mole chicken sandwich which had a nice tangy and spicy spread. The two soups I've tasted, the carrot coconut soup and the onion soup, are both excellent. The three cheese panini is another delicious sandwich. It has gorgonzola, mozzarella, goat cheese, tomatoes, and basil and you can add chicken (which I did), turkey, or prosciutto to it. The chicken curry sandwich has a creamy yellow curry sauce with a little bit of heat. The key to any great sandwich is the bread and theirs is fabulous. A little thick and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy inside. According to the owner the bread is baked daily from dough imported from France.   Portion sizes aren't super-sized like most sandwich places these days. But, they are a size that I would consider to be normal and healthy. If you're in a hurry, this may not be the best place to go because it does take a while to get your order. Which I attribute to a more laid back European culture than the fast-food mentality that most Americans have. But, the food is worth it. You can tell it's meticulously and thoughtfully prepared. You can feel the care and love that the owner(s) put into this establishment. And, it doesn't just stop with the food. The feel of the cafe is like a clean, modern, Starbucks-esque interior (with less merchandise and flair). It's their attention to detail -- from ingredients to plating -- that make this place a hidden gem and the friendly staff make this a fantastic establishment. The only real negatives about this place are the difficult to find office park location and the fact that they're not open late or on weekends.  4.5 Stars",

It's about 20 minutes away from the strip and is located in a business park.  If you're coming here for the first time, it can be a little hard to find, but don't give up because it's worth it!!  The service is excellent where the person who took my order asked me questions about myself and even introduced himself.  He asked me if I've ever been here before too (which is such a difference from the robots who work on the strip restaurants and cafes).    I ordered their daily special, a Morrocan chicken sandwich.  The chicken was seriously the moistest chicken I've ever had.  I quickly ate my sandwich not only because I was hungry, but this place is a little small, so getting a table might be hard to do when it's busy.  There are tables outside, however, I visited in August and it was 110 degrees outside.",

The reason this place only got three stars instead of five was I felt that some of the people working there were a tad snooty. I realize this is completely subjective and may not have been reality at all but when I come in and say hello how does this work is there a menu or something the lady turns and says there is a register right there and kept walking to the kitchen with some dishes I believe it was. That was the extent of my greeting not hello not hi but there's a register right there. Ok then. I dunno maybe it's the Frenchness maybe it was something else but that was one thing that bothered me I really didn't feel welcomed I felt like I was a bit of a burden being in their restaurant. Very unfortunate for such yummy food. I will certainly try it again due to the level of the food hopefully it'll be a better experience next time.",

I can't believe it took me so long to check it out! All ingredients are so fresh and everything is so flavorful. Also, all of the sammies have veggie options which is fantastic, considering not a lot of places in town offer a wide array of vegetarian options. Order the Blue Brie with mushrooms and you won't regret a single bite. Getting hungry just thinking about it!",

The owner remembered my name on my second visit a week after my first which was fairly impressive. They hand make all their pastries and you can tell because they are great and definitely fresh. If you dont get there early they are usually out of most of them though which does suck.   I usually get the prosciutto sandwich and a lemon tart. Its a great combination! The quiche they make in the morning is soooo good but they are usually out of it by the time I get there. The soups and salads I have had there were nothing special, so I personally wouldn't recommend them which is why no 5th star.   The coffees are pretty good as well.  Be warned that they are in a business park so if you go during peak lunch time they are usually really busy and you may find yourself without a seat  and in a long line. But this place is a must try for anybody looking for a private sandwich shop.",

Family owned and French cuisine inspired, this place has some of the best sandwiches, soups and pastries I have had in Las Vegas.  I first visited this restaurant for a relaxed lunch with my girlfriend while driving around town... And boy am I glad I did! Walking into this place you are immediately greeted with a warm welcome by the owner and by the sight of delicious deserts and treats. From coffee to panini to creamy and tasty soups, this place has something for everyone.  We started off with a chicken pesto panini and a cup of squash soup, both of them amazingly good. By the flavor of our meal we could tell everything is made fresh that day (so the later you make it there, the slightly more limited your choices might be) and prepared to order! Please make sure to arrive hungry so you can try the peach or the pear pastry... You will love them.  Note: this place is a bit difficult to find so refer to the yelp profile picture which has the accurate location on it. Lastly, please beware they close at 4pm, so this is a breakfast and lunch spot.",

The person at the counter took the time to explain everything on the menu on my first visit and was very helpful in choosing some items.  I had a Moroccan chicken sandwich and sun choke soup. Both were obviously made fresh with high quality ingredients.  This is the kind of place that you can really \"feel the love\" in the food and the service. It is always nice to find a restaurant where the staff obviously cares so much about the experience the customers have. This place is a bit of a drive from my house and I am certain I will visit again.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out because of all the good reviews. However, we were extremely disappointed because of the ***VERY*** small sandwiches and the fact we had to go to another place just after eating here to eat lunch again because their portions are more like an appetizer. And, I am 150 lbs and my wife, 120 lbs so we are small people with a normal appetite.  I don't know how places get by with a $ sign on Yelp when this could not be further from the truth. Their sandwiches are more like 1/2 of a typical sandwich and very stingy on the additional items like lettuce and tomato (micro bits and pieces). I told one of the owners we were disappointed and he blamed it on the baguette company not being consistent with their bread sizes. Come on, if the bread comes in too small,  you don't just rip off your customer,  you let them know up front and give a discount or something extra.  This place is so tight and out of touch with reality that they give you just a few tiny pieces of lettuce on the plate which they called a small salad but it wasn't enough for a new born rabbit. Seriously, to see it was to believe it...they had to try hard to tear the lettuce that small.   So, if you want to spend $16 on one whole sandwich (two of their sandwiches x $8) to get full go ahead. But this place is off the list!! Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but the the prices per portion would make this place easily $$$ restaurant!  And, the people were nice but I'm not in the habit of donating to the success of restaurants without something in return.  No thanks!  And, this is a legitimate review by an engineer and his wife with no ax-to-grind against this establishment or owners. There was another couple that came in with us at the same time. It was their first time too and they left with the same disappointment as us, and we both questioned whether or not the owners may be better at generating False Yelp reviews than they are at running a fair establishment.",

I have been frequenting Olivier, Shelby and the gang for quite sometime now and all I have to say is Thank God for Baguette Cafe.   I love everything about this place. Upon entry into this unassuming cafe, you are greeted with a smile and the delightful smell of fresh baked breads and pastries. I love the purity and love that goes into the food here. It really is unlike any other cafe in the Las Vegas area. The staff is very enthusiastic about what they serve and it shows. Olivier will take the time, despite a line out the door at lunch time, to describe in detail the daily specials of soups, sandwiches and pastries.   I have been here too many times to count. With the free wireless, I often find myself setting up shop and spending the morning or afternoon catching up on graduate school or just chatting with friends.   Some of my favorite daily specials served: Chicken curry sandwich, shrimp bisque, french peasant stew, Moroccan chicken sandwich, gazpacho, spinach and cheese quiche, pear tart.....OK now I'm making myself hungry again.  They have a wide range of beverages and serve Illy coffee!  Some of my favorite drinks: Thai iced tea, green tea iced tea, CHAI SO AMAZING.   Warning: It becomes very busy at lunch time and also is not open on the weekends. Also sometimes food takes a bit due to the nature of the care that goes into the sandwiches they prepare. I really dislike the reviews of this place stating the service is slow or that it took too long to get their sandwich. Baguette cafe is the type of place that makes you want to slow down and enjoy your coffee and meal.",

I ordered the chicken sandwich and the chicken was moist and juicy.    Service was a bit on the low side.  Their credit card machine was not working and the employee spent about 10 minutes trying to run my card though. This held up the line.  The employee should have known how to manually process the card.  Also, when they delivered the food, I asked for an extra box which was never brought to me.

    "text": "il ya beaucoup de choses merveilleuses a dire sur baguette cafe!  Not every place lives up to the hype.  That said, I find it even rarer for a place to exceed expectations.  Baguette Cafe has done that for me!  Baguette Cafe is one of the absolute best breakfast/brunch/lunch cafes you will find for the dollar!  Please know that I am way more into savory Items that sweet varieties.  I have a lot of friends that shell out 4 strong stars here for the pastries, but I am so into their savory items!  It's an easy 5 stars in my book.  Chef Olivier is one of the nicest and more engaging owners you will meet.  Passionate about food, he takes time with any willing audience to impart a depth of knowledge about the products being used in your meal.  This may not change the way your meal tastes, but it certainly enhances the experience for anyone that remotely cares about what they ingest.    The quiches here might be the best I've had in Vegas...and if not the best, they are certainly in the conversation.  A light and buttery crust gives way to a balanced and scrumptious filling.  Their soups are equally enjoyable.  They change regularly, but are consistently wonderful!  I also have a lot of love for their grilled sandwiches--The Curry, Blue Brie, and Moroccan all worth trying out.  Limited hours prevent some from enjoying Baguette Cafe, so check out the days and hours of operation before you head over here...but do make a point to stop by and enjoy their offerings!  As an insightful reviewer has pointed out, the best way to get there, if you are going west on 215, is to exit Buffalo and take Raphael Rivera.  That way you can avoid the Office Park maze.",

    "text": "Owner/Chef Olivier is super friendly and introduced himself as I perused the menu- opted to get two sandwiches to share with my guy (the Eggplant and the Chipotle) along with a cup of the soup of the day (roasted red pepper). Sandwiches were made fresh to order, brought out wrapped up tight and hot to the touch. Wait time was a reasonable ten minutes.  Chipotle was delish, with chipotle sauce, chicken, bacon, avocado, and pepper jack cheese- lots of flavor and a tiny bit of kick without too much spice. Eggplant sandwich was better than expected, with fresh-grilled veggie, mozzarella, and tomato pesto, served on a fresh and chewy baguette that held up despite the moisture of the sauces and the ample amount of stuffing in the sandwich itself.  Soup was good and clearly homemade- flavorful and creamy without feeling heavy. Cup is a tiny portion, BF inhaled it and I barely got a taste. Didn't expect him to enjoy this flavor but it was gone so fast, he must have! ;)  Wish hours were more convenient for early dinners or weekends to visit regularly.   TIP: Location can be difficult to find. From Sunset, turn into the office park and wind your way to the very back (towards the highway). Yes, you can get here without being on the 215 access road.",

When I called Baguette Cafe, I was told no wait at all.  Now that could be good news, or I could be bad news. Was there a reason this was the only place with no wait on a Sunday at noon? I felt it was worthwhile to take a chance rather than wait 30 minutes for lunch someplace else. Turned out really well. While the address is on Sunset, it would be much easier to find if you enter off of the 215 freeway Service Road (just east of Ikea). This place is truly a well-hidden gem. It is located in the very back of an office complex off of Sunset. The restaurant itself is rather small with indoor seating for about 24 people. We got there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon so we were able to take advantage of the outdoor patio seating, which is absolutely delightful. We shared the vegetable quiche and the prosciutto quiche. Each was very fresh with a good quality crust. Very very tasty. I also ordered a cup of coffee. This had to be the largest cup I've ever received. Good quality strong flavorful coffee. This was an excellent choice for a Sunday brunch on the patio on a warm summer day.",

The Blue Brie - Had the chicken version and it was a little interesting having a hot sandwhich but with sliced apples...intresting as in it was weird...weird as in not in a good way...  The Curry - had flavor and was good...got the chicken version  Quiche - Very good and rich  Apple Pastry - One of the best and reminds me of the ones i get at the Japanese dessert or French dessert places...fresh apples with a buttery crust  Honestly that Prosciutto Sandwich with that bread and spread is some of the most high quality sandwich for a $6ish price point. I don't know it's something about that specific sandwich that warrants this place a 5 star however me being who I am tried a wide variety of things and the way that Prosciutto sandwich made me feel can not be said the same for some of the other sandwiches. All in all this place does provide a high quality product at a reasonable price. Feels legit and authentic and you could taste the love and passion in their food.",

    "text": "I have to give it to you Vegas Yelpers for giving this completely hidden gem, that is hella off, off, off, off, the Strip cafe (break out the GPS) the accolades it deeply deserves.  I know it's wrong that I didn't want to post my review in order to preserve this secret spot for myself, but, in the end, it didn't matter since 300 other Yelpers still found about and yelped it.  Anyways, The food here is just absolutely delicious. And the vegan option simply makes it that more special.  Sandwiches are made with freshly baked bread and an eclectic selection of tasty ingredients.  The soups are lovingly made from scratch and the freshness and quality is pretty evident with each wonderful sip.  Moreover, Oliver made our visit feel more like going to a friend's home than a cafe. He is warm and inviting, super amicable, and to hear him gush about the food, makes you realize how much love and pride goes into the cooking.  I do not give out five stars lightly and is more rare that I give such a high review after a first visit but Cafe Baguette is like no other place I've visited before.",

I tried a friend's croissant sandwich and it was phenomenal. Friendly and enthusiastic service too! I will be back!",

Now for the food..  The Croissants are TO DIE FOR. I love coming in and smelling them when they just come out, they're seriously mouthwatering. I get the croissant breakfast sandwich and add turkey- its under $5, super filling and delicious.   I've tried the fresh squeezed juices and I'm impressed with them all, you can tell they're actually fresh squeezed to order.   And of course, The coffee and lattes don't disappoint..

It is one of those places where what you had last time was so good you want it again but then want to try something new because everything you have ever ordered was delicious.  So you sit there going back and forth in your head until it is your turn to order and you just blurt something out.  Or maybe that is just me.  The Pesto, Moroccan and Ham & Swiss Croissant are a few of my favorites.  Oh and the pastry case is to die for.  Get there early, items sell out.  I always hope for the chocolate tarte with fresh strawberries but I haven't had anything that wasn't amazing.    I have had a few service issues.  More than once I have had to ask for drinks and pastries that were not brought out long after my food had arrived.  After the first time I tried waiting nearby to get my drink and items from the pastry case and was shooed away and told they will bring it to me.  Which they did after I had eaten most of my lunch and went to the counter to ask for it.",

I added a ton of cream and even tossed a sugar in to try and balance it out. The watermelon lemonade was delicious though.   We sat outside on the patio. Every table was covered with dirty dishes and they were napkins blowing around because it was a windy day. The dirty tables remained as they were the entire time we ate. The table we sat at had been wiped off so we wiped it ourselves. Definitely not a great site to see when trying a new restaurant.  The staff are very friendly, and quite helpful!

Ambiance: small inside with a few tables but also nice outdoor patio area that is dog friendly. Small pastry display case.   Location: in a plaza next to an industrial business park. Dead area on the weekends, but the restaurant was packed. Handy to come here after visiting IKEA.

The owners finally got it straight and decided they should be open 7 days a week. I'm so grateful for that!   The ambiance is Portland. It's very trendy and retro. The inside was very clean and very busy. The line was almost out the door and there was only 1 server. I think they were a little short staff cause we went first thing in the morning at 9am.   Pricing is decent. Holy smokes! If you look at the size of the quiche I ordered, you would not mind paying what I paid. I didn't try any of the drinks this time, so all I ordered was food!  Quiche - this thing was the size of a pizza. No JOKE! A freaking size of a pizza. It was huge! It was so fresh that I bent my plastic fork. Lol. This was also very True. When I opened the togo container the quiche looked so amazing I took one bite before I started driving. That was when the heat bent my plastic fork. Lmao. There was plenty of prosciutto in this slice. Every bite I took, had a pice of prosciutto. I love mushrooms! OMG the mushrooms were were huge in my piece. I hope they make the whole pie like how they make my piece.    Greek Salad - I did wish they put a little more lettuce in this salad. It wasn't very big. The container it came with was still very empty. Although the dressing was very good I think I could've gotten more lettuce since there was no meat in this salad.     Chipotle Sandwich - I really though this sandwich was going to taste similar and better than the ones offered at Earl's but it's not. The sandwich was not spicy. So don't be scared to order it. There was a decent amount of chicken, but the taste was a little off. I couldn't pin point what I didn't like about it though.   There is so much to offer here, that I would still give it 4 stars because I probably just ordered the wrong things. But what I did order was decent and not bad. Give it a try if you're in the area around 215 and going towards Summerlin.",

The curry chicken sandwich: Light on curry flavor, mildly filling. I wish there was a side (other than the few pieces of lettuce) that it came with. At over $7 I want some fries or fruit.  Acai bowl: A little too big and watery for my liking. Lacking in toppings for the price. Order it somewhere else.  They have a cute balcony area (if you ignore the parking lot) to sit in. Inside gets a little busy and frantic. Not a great place to study, but decent for a quick coffee/book.",

They put some type of red aoili sauce on it and it was great!   But the best item of all was their chocolate torte. OMG it was SO GOOD. It has an almond flour crust and the chocolate is just fantastically chocolately and sweet and dark. If you stop in you have to try it. It's amazing.   Their outdoor seating area is adorable as well.

I recommend the 3 cheese panini and the only thing that would have made it better would have been tomato bisque was the soup of the day cuz the weather was overcast with hint of winter chill.  Easiest way to access is off Buffalo/215 W and take the Rafael Riviera way west and make a right into the office park just before the Durango exit. Hope that makes sense cuz it's really worth a trip.",

Not hard since it's right around the corner from my office, and just a little away from our home. Oliver's customer service is amazing and I swear, he recognizes whether it's first time or you've been there before - his customer service skills are amazing... he has a great memory. I believe it's Oliver's mother that does all the pastry baking, and I've not been disappointed with any of the choices ordered. Our 4 year old loves it here also.  Recommendations are: The Moroccan Sandwich Croissant Fenancier (I think that's how it's spelled - they're pretty much almond honey cakes)  If you love coffee and/or you have a sweet tooth - you've got to check this spot out! In general, it's a great place for breakfast and lunch; such a hidden gem. Makes me want to plan a trip to Paris.",

    "text": "I've had this place on my radar screen for a very long time.  I finally decided to give it a try when I was in the area recently.  The name is kind of misleading.....I was expecting a sit-down restaurant with table service, what I found was a Coffee Shop (a la Starbucks), except it's locally owned.  I was a little disappointed because I had built up a huge appetite and the menu was very limited.  After a few minutes I decided to get their Cheese Pannini.  When I arrived, there was only 1 person in front of me, so I thought the service was going to be fast.....it wasn't.  It took almost 15 minutes to make my Paninni.....which for a sit-down restaurant wouldn't be bad, but for an order at the counter type place, it's kind of a long time.  I arrived just before the lunch rush (11:30 am)....while I was waiting, it got very busy with 10 people in line or so.  They are single threaded here with their food preparation, so I can't imagine how long they will have to wait for their food.  Anyway, when my food came out, it looked great.  I couldn't wait to take a bite of the Paninni.  It was as good as it looked, very good! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=iM-bmUJgFX3I3lpLT57uTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUK...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA?select=E2YbzDiWAomUXZQu3VtjSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hIUK...</a> The Tomato Sauce in the Paninni was great and full of flavor.  The Bread was very tasty too.  The Paninni came with a very small side of greens which also went well with the dish.  I wish there were more greens.  Overall, it was a good experience.  However, for those with large appetites, I wouldn't suggest it....the portions are too small and ordering two Paninnis wouldn't be cost effective.  The joint is situated between a bunch of office buildings and is suited more for that crowd than a casual diner.  The staff is very nice here and makes a sincere attempt and getting to know their guests.  They asked me what my name was and where I was from, where I heard about the place, etc.....and they knew several of the people who stopped by for lunch by their 1st name....I'm guessing by the way they were dressed that they worked in one of the buildings nearby.  Return Factor - 30%",

    "text": "Two Words: absolutely delicious.  This place is chock-full of character. It's a great escape from a horrendous workday. I've never been to France but the vibe here feels French cafe-esque. The owner, who is French, is also the cashier and he is a total charmer. Plus he is happy to help you out with your order should you have any questions. Sometimes I just ask him questions I know the answer to just to hear his accent. I know I know.... And It's also a family owned\\run restaurant so that also adds some warm and fuzzies to the experience.  I've been here twice (soon to be 3x because I want to go back tomorrow). Both times I ordered the chipotle sandwich and both times I considered licking every crumb and drop of sauce off my plate. I could say it was the flavor combination. I could say it was due to the incredible chipotle sauce and fresh avocados. I could also say that it was the fresh & crisp baguette it came on. I'll just say it was all of the above.  I ordered a cup of the cream of celery soup today. I don't even like celery all that much, but I had heard the owner\\cashier describe it to the guy in front of me and I was sold. My only regret was I didn't order a bowl.... or a gallon. There was a distinct essence of  fresh celery in the soup but somehow, maybe magically, the creaminess mixed in with the freshness made this the best cup of soup I can remember. Apparently I do like celery.  Both times I ordered a coffee beverage. For the coffee snobs out there, myself included, they serve Illy coffee. For the non-coffee snobs -- this is AWESOME coffee. First time was drip coffee the 2nd was an iced white mocha.... both yummy.  So for a half sandwich, a cup of soup, and medium iced white mocha totals just 12 bucks..... a small price to pay for perfection, I'd say. Baguette Cafe is a jewel of a lunch joint. If I didn't work in the area, I'd find an excuse to drive across town just to enjoy it.  Run don't walk to this place. It's an all-around crowdpleaser.",

    "text": "If my office was closer I'd eat here nearly everyday (as it is I make the trek 1-2x a week!). Olivier is a fabulous host and seems genuine and passionate about the quality of his food. Yup, it's just a sandwich shop, but I cannot think of a better soup/salad/sandwich spot in town. His food reminds me of eating in a cute cafe in Paris without the price tag!   I typically get the Proscuitto salad and one of his yummy soups. They change daily and have yet to disappoint. The cream of mushroom was the best cream of mushroom I've ever had. I look forward to trying more of them every time I go.   My favorite new addition to the menu is the FRESH Thai coconuts !! I adore coconut water so getting the chance to drink out of a fresh coconut from Thailand on my lunch break is a major treat.  I won't deduct any stars for this, but it's a major bummer there is never any quiche when I go at lunch. Apparently it sells out at breakfast. I keep crossing my fingers and hoping he'll have some at lunch time someday!!  The selection of baked type things is relatively limited in general, but I appreciate that they make the baked good fresh so it's hard to have a huge variety on hand at a small restaurant.   I adore Baguette Cafe because there is decidedly nothing Vegas about it. Fresh healthy DELICIOUS foods served by a charming owner - I've found my favorite lunch spot in Vegas.",

Being born in France & Educated in Italy, im VERY picky when it comes to food being\"labeled\" french or Italian made. But Olivier is the REAL DEAL!! I bought a Pain au Raisin( raisin bread/croissant), thinking it would b close but WOW, it brought me back to my childhood w/my grandmother@the boulangerie(bakery). While Olivier was speaking to my husband, i looked over the menu, and cant wait to try everything and will def be back!! Merci Olivier pour avoir amene un tout petit peu de la France ici",

The way the cheese makes the egg moist, and the fresh qualities of the tomatoes, truly makes it tasty. The chocolate croissant, although great, cannot compare to what I have had in Paris. But, it is one I would order again. The latte we had was not too strong, and not too weak; a great balance of flavors. The staff was very friendly and did not rush us to order or rush us out. They assisted us adequately and let us take our time. They were very hospitable. The pictures around the cafe are of Paris which takes me right back to my trip and memories of that country.",

Yes folks, it is a little bit out of the way, but so worth it.  I envy those that can come here to get their cup of Joe and yummy eats here easily.    I came here because Jesse N said that this place was sooo my flavor.  I'm so lucky to have him because he was right, this is so my type of cafe!    Oliver takes all the time to give you exceptional service, and he will go out of his way to impress you.  Call you by name, make sure he answers any of your questions, he'll have a chat with you if he can, make recommendations, you name it, he goes above and beyond!  I tried the Eggplant panini, and it was super super SUPER delish.  I was planning on adding meat, but forgot to because I was indecisive and holding up the line.  However, when I did get to chow down my panini, I think I seriously finished it in a few big bites, I really didn't even need the meat.    I was running late for work and figured I would also get a pastry for my Admin for covering me and one for myself too. Lucky me they had Chocolate croissants and Raisin Croissants fresh out of the oven, and yes I got both.  Ssshhh but I totally did not give the other pastry to my admin...oink oink to me.    I'm definitely a fan!",

We also tried the chocolate tart which was divine. My husband had the chicken pesto sandwich which he loved as well. The owner was so friendly and sweet and took the time to introduce himself as well as explain how the menu worked and what was not on the menu but available for the day. The only downside to this place is that it is only open until 5pm and no weekends. Still I'm off enough in the week that I plan to visit this place often.",

    "text": "So after posting my review - Olivier writes me - not asking why my experience was the way it was - or how to improve his cafe - but simply expressed himself like an arrogant, elitist, pretentious - well, French guy.  He then went on to question my ability to differentiate excellent food from crap - I believe his analogy implied that I could not recognize a diet pepsi from a cab sav.  Sorry Oivier - I'm not a \"frustrated want to be foodie\" as you wrote, or the jealous competition.  I don't claim to be a foodie, nor do I aspire to be one.  I'm a simple guy - who enjoys nice things, good food, atmosphere, and company.  I've dined at a handful of Michelin rated restaurants, and enjoy the local hole-in-the-wall establishments around town.  I am not trying to diminish anyone's livelihood - as I understand the owner should take pride in his establishment.  But I also truly feel that Baguette Cafe does not deserve a 4-5 star review.  I went out of my way to try the food here simply because of the high rating - and I feel this was extremely deceiving.  Everyone's palate is different, but I think I have a pretty good gauge on what tastes good, and what doesn't.  Olivier - you don't have to convince everyone that walks in how great your food is by telling them pretentiously to their face -  let them decide on their own.  Good luck!",

I am not necessarily a sandwich person but the combinations of meats/cheeses and sauces really show the attention to detail and his culinary skills.   He is one talented young man!  I hope his business is successful for years to come. If you have not tried it, check it out.  He is visible from the 215 freeway at buffalo adjacent to Pulte Homes' offices.

    "text": "Was looking for some baguettes to make some Banh mi. Google'd baguettes vegas and this popped up. Since I didn't know of any other places that sold Baguettes, I thought I give this place a try. No Yelp reviews either.  A pain in the arse to find. Buried in a sea of office space. What sucks is the only way to get to this place is taking Frontage Rd, which happens to be a 1 way street. So if you're coming from the west side of this place like me, you're going have to make a big circle to get to this place. Also, don't miss it, or you have to go around in circles. Be sure to have your navi if you suck with directions.  When I eventually found this place, I was the only one there, with another group of people who seem to work in one of the office space around the area. The place looked like it just opened. The chef is apparently French, but doesn't seem to have that heavy French accent, so you can understand him.   The Ham Sandwich I got was served with a Baguette. Just a warning, this isn't the same French Baguettes that are super long. They are less than a foot long (I think). He made it fresh, so it took a little longer than if you were eating at Subway. He did tell me while I was waiting, just wish he told me before I ordered. The ham and greens of choice were very fresh. You can taste each individual ingredient and just yummy. Beats Subway and even Togos by far. Haven't tried Capriotti yet, so can't compare. My sandwich came out to $6 and some change which isn't too bad for what you're getting.   They also have an illy espresso machine and illy branded cups. I'm not an espresso drinker so can't comment on those.  Bottom line, if you want something a lot better then Subway for a small premium and you can find this place, try it. Would get a 5 star, but had to knock it for its crappy location and the wait time till my sandwich was ready.",

Before we walked in, we see they use illy coffee beans for their coffee which was my wife's favorite. The coffee were pure, just what we needed in the morning. What amazed us even more were their sandwiches. we ordered bleu brie in panini and turkey in baguette. Their bread was freshly made daily, and they do a 1/2 price after 4pm on the breads before they close at 5pm. For a successfull sandwich the bread is very important. We can taste from the texture of the bread is crispy on the outside, but soft in the inside.   The staffs were very friendly, and their cafe shop provides wi-fi and set menus. We took it to go since we were on a schedule, but the shop was almost packed with people. However, their service speed was kinda slow, since there were only 3 people on duty. So I don't recommend for a fast-paced person to come eat here.   1/1 Service / environment 3/4 Food Taste experience  One of the best coffee places, if you have some free time and just want to relax and enjoy a good bite with good coffee, this is the place for you to be.",

Family owned and operated and the owner is almost always here, behind the counter making magic happen. Everything is fresh from the bread to the juice.   I've never had a bad experience here at Baguette Cafe. They've made a loyal customer out of me!  We always order these:   Ham & Swiss croissant  Chipotle chicken sandwich  Be the change juice  Mocha roca coffee (so good!!!!)",

They offer savory and sweet. Whichever you are feeling like, you will not be disappointed. I bring my kids, because they always want the pastries, and I can eat some of theirs, when I order something savory. My husband is very picky, doesn't like many places, and he is always the one suggesting we go here.  There may be a little bit of a wait in the line to order, and then again when you are waiting for your food, but it is worth it. The owner is always at the cash register, with a smile, and ready to tell you what is special that day, and which quiches are available - in his beautiful french accent. Good thing I don't live closer or I'd be in serious trouble. French women may not get fat, but us American women do! Which reminds me, they also have fresh juices pressed right there that are equally delicious. The apple is especially wonderful if you ask my boys.",

Since the first few times I've been here back in 2012, they've added things to the menu.   The two sandwiches I personally recommend and like to get are: Curry chicken sandwich &  The Chipotle  Curry seems to be the most popular but it's just so delicious! First timers, definitely get that one :0D.  The place is quaint so if it's busy there won't be much room to sit. However, they do have outside seating so that's a plus. It's inside the office complex so you have to do a bit of hide and seeking to find it. ;)",

You might get a little confused driving there, at least I was, or maybe my gps took me a funny way-who knows.  But, once you get there Baguette Cafe is definitely a good find!  It's a small little place and the staff is extremely nice and helpful.  The girl at the counter could tell it was our first time and walked us through the menu!  I decided to keep it simple and got a ham and swiss croissant and an iced white chocolate macadamia nut cookie latte. Yes, you read that correctly.  When I saw that on the menu, I thought I had died and went to heaven.   The ham and swiss croissant was typical.  It was pretty good, but nothing that blew me away or stood out, but then again I did keep it simple and didn't order one of their other more specialty items.  The latter though-whew!! I was in love as soon as my lips touched the straw sucked up that liquid gold.  If for the latte alone, I am in OBSESSED with this place.  From what I could over hear from the party next to us, their quiches are delicious as well.  There was a chocolate pie I was interested in trying, but was too full from my main meal.  This is definitely a healthy alternative for when I am on my best friend's side of town.  And let's be honest, the trek is worth it for that iced white chocolate macadamia nut cookie latte!!!!",

    "text": "The Baguette Cafe is one of the best-kept secrets in town!!!  It's secretly hidden from your view unless you venture to the back of the office park on West Sunset Road, northwest of the 215 and Buffalo Drive.  The baguettes, on which the sandwiches are served on is baked in-house. They are very light, crusty and buttery. My favorite sandwich is the \"Prosciutto\" which consists of mixed greens, prosciutto, tomatoes, and blue cheese spread. I have had fantastic Quiche in many different French Cafes in Las Vegas, but Baguette Cafe surpasses them of all. It's fluffy, creamy, and very satisfying, the secret is in the flour and  temperature control.  Don't leave without trying the torte, the chocolate and the mixed fruit taste heavenly.  Olivier is an amazing host, very nice and humble!! On occasion, I'll mildly observe peoples interactions with him and he's always puts smiles on peoples faces. He genuinely cares about his customers, and the regulars feel that positive vibe thus express the appreciation.  The prices are very reasonable, you won't be disappointed.  This cafe is definitely worth checking out!!!",

Finally made it out here with some friends, and Olivier didn't disappoint with his sandwiches and coffee. Got a large latte and the cups were huge - felt like I was bringing a mixing bowl to my face with every sip. But great coffee.  Got the egg, cheese, bacon on baguette. Nothing here is rocket science, but simplicity is elegance sometimes. Baguette was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Ordered croissants and a parfait to go. Same results - fresh, buttery, flaky croissants and organic yogurt with fresh fruit.  I wish the ordering was a little speedier but it was okay because we weren't in a rush. Honestly, I'm not sure how often I'll be back here because of the location, but anytime I'm around, I'll probably stop by - maybe when Ikea opens up!",

It reminds me very much of cafes in France.  Everything I've had off the menu, from salads to sandwiches, quiches to desserts, has been delicious and of the highest quality. Service is always friendly.   The only downside is that it gets busy and sometimes it's tough to get a table.

I was also offered to try their in-house cream of zucchini soup once and it was definitely one of the best soups I've tasted. Nothing I've tried here has disappointed, and the food always comes out hot and freshly made, super tasty. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but I always prefer to sit outdoors to enjoy the morning with my brunch. Love coming here for a pleasant meal with great service and environment.",

What makes this cafe a daily dining must for me is that all the food is made from scratch with only the freshest ingredients and yet I can have lunch there for a price comparable to any fast food chain.  It's unfortunate I can only give them 5 stars...  They really deserve at least six...",

It is a nice little French Cafe that has patio seating available. The guy at the register was very friendly and he had the French accent to go alone with the French themed cafe. The dining area looked nice and clean and so did the service area.  They use Illy coffee her, it's one of my favorite automatic drip coffees. It also is good to use in a French press. We ordered the 20oz cups. We ordered the Vegan Pesto Eggplant and the Moroccan Eggplant sandwiches. Both sandwiches were served on baguettes and were very good. We also tried the chocolate twist. It was basically a chocolate croissant. That was very good, especially with the coffee. The berry tarts looked amazing, but they will have to wait until next time.  I will definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. I would recommend you give this place a try.",

    "text": "Eight miles southwest of the strip, in an area that's mostly comprised of businesses, but slowly becoming more residential, lies Baguette Cafe. Given the locale and demographics, they're only open mornings and early afternoon until 3 pm. On the bright side, they're open on weekends too, for those in Vegas for weekend trips.  I love pesto, so when I saw the pesto grilled sandwich listed, I knew I had to order it. You get your choice of chicken and bacon or eggplant. Of course, I picked chicken and bacon. The sandwich is so good - my favorite part was the bread. Haha.   The croissants had been freshly baked, so I also got the croissant and egg with turkey. The croissant itself was flaky and buttery. Definitely my favorite part of this item. Both the croissant and egg and the grilled sandwich came with a side of salad.  BF ordered the drip coffee. For 16 oz., it came in this huge mug, with separate containers to add cream and sugar to taste. A nice complement to our sandwiches.  There's indoor and outdoor patio seating. We opted outside because indoors was a bit warm (from the baking and cooking, maybe?), but outside had its challenges as well because the wind picked up and wrestled with our loose napkins and paper. Other than the blustery breeze, the outdoor patio seating would've been great during a normal sunny day.  The food experience so far would've been 5 stars, but we also got some pastries to go since the food was so good. We ordered two fresh croissants, a chocolate croissant, and the chocolate twist. I read rave reviews for the chocolate twist so I was excited to see it in stock. We took it to go to later enjoy in the hotel room. While the croissant was fresh and delicious, the chocolate croissant was okay, and the chocolate twist was the disappointing one of all. It must have been sitting in the display case for a reason because there was white stringy things on the chocolate part of the twist. I thought it was crystallized sugar but it wasn't. Ended up tossing the twist in the trash since it wasn't salvagable. =/  Will return for the sandwiches, but not for the baked goods itself.",

My friend recommended this place to me... and as I'm searching yelp for nearby lunch options, I notice my office is a mile away.  Now, back to the actual review. Service and cleanliness, top notch. Food... AMAZING. Had the pesto sandwich on a croissant (of course I would). Each bite was perfect. So perfect that for dessert, I ordered ANOTHER croissant (plain this time, but just as good). Looking forward to trying other options on their menu.  Shout out to Oliver for the friendly service. The only downer? Food so good, forgot to take a picture.

I ordered the Croissant & Egg with Ham which has swiss cheese omelette, spinach, tomato basil sauce, and ham. The croissant was flakey and delicious and the sandwich as a whole was savory with each flavor popping out of it. All of the ingredients are fresh and made-to-order.  The employees are all very friendly and knowledgeable. They can describe any menu item to you and probably give you some history behind why the item is on the menu too. Baguette Cafe offers daily specials as well. I'll be sure to stop here every time I am in Vegas.",

I guess it's one of their popular items since the two tables next to us ordered the same. The owner was really friendly and his mom was too...and funny! I'm a sucker for cute cafes and this place is added to that list! The only downside to this place is it was too hot...I'm not one to sweat right away but I was getting a little flushed while enjoying my food.

Every latte's I have tried have been perfect, and that chocolate twist is to die for.   I like how its small and hidden within this huge plaza. So it might be hard to find the place if you haven't been.   The customer service is simply on point. Every time I'm there, I see every one smiling and hustling. I love it! Everyone's so helpful and awake. Havent seen a grump just yet. Also, I witnessed an accident once and fortunately the girl who was apart of the accident didn't mind too much. I believe the girl spilled some coffee, and broke a cup. I believe the owner came out to apologize and accommodate them as much as he can. People make mistakes, and I'm glad the customer wasn't infuriated.  The place itself is small, but there is a ton of outside seating. On a nice beautiful day, sit outside with your coffee and munch of some pastry. It's simply delightful. Even with the French music playing.   It's simple, delicious, customer service is A+, and a great experience. I even saw a family come in from out of town. They said they saw the reviews on here and wanted to try it out. They were all happy! They said it out loud. Haha.   I recommend, most definitely",

I like the fact that we have finally a nice place to eat a little bit more upscale that the old bit up bakeries :-(. (Don't get me wrong, they're good but the experience is different). Finally a place outside the strip that blends perfectly atmosphere, food and service in Las Vegas! Gotta love it!  Atmosphere 4/5: Comfy chairs, they even have a sofa. The place is nice and looks new. It's not French touch but it's modern and different from other places! Quiet with some good music in background and you have the perfect mix for a good atmosphere.  Food 5/5: I tried the Quiche Lorraine and the Bleu Brie Sandwich and it was awesome! I loved it! The Bleu Brie sandwich matched perfectly the taste of sweet (with the slices of apple) and sour ( with Bleu cheese)! Yes PERFECT! Service 5/5: Service is excellent. The lady made sure to ask me that everything was alright even it's not a waiter service kind of place! Making sure that your customer is happy is their principal goal and you can feel it!  This place is entering into my must-go places now when I'm in Vegas! Thank you for bringing a little bit of modern classiness place outside the strip!! Awesome!",

    "text": "A likeable Frenchman. Talk about your oxymorons.  I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but it's WAAY off the beaten path for me, so I waited until I had to pick up my equally adventurous niece (hereinafter referred to as \"Rosebud\") from the airport, and we decided to search it out for a late lunch. (\"Search\" is no exaggeration - thanks to whoever posted that handy little map!)  Once you find it, it's a pleasant little place with an absolute sweetheart (Olivier - the aforementioned Frenchman) behind the counter. Selections were on a chalkboard. I went with the curried chicken sandwich and zucchini parmesan soup. The bread was great, and the chicken was hot, juicy, and clearly freshly cooked. Rosebud went for the four-cheese special, and wound up having to scrape off some of the gorgonzola because it was too pungent. I had zero sympathy. People who order blue-veined cheeses get what they deserve.  Because dessert is mandatory, she went with a croissant stuffed with Nutella, which she would have preferred heated. (Mighty picky for a non-paying guest, don't you think?), and I had the last slice of chocolate tart, which I eyed nervously every time some potential interloper stepped anywhere near the display case. It was silky and rich, and it was mine.  Fellow Diet Coke addicts, be forewarned: Olivier fell victim to the silly internet urban legends about D.C. not being good for you, and stocks an alien brand of sugarless cola. The bottle was beautiful, and it didn't taste too bad, but it was not a reasonable substitute. I yam what I yam, and next time I'll bring my own.",

Cons: * A bit too difficult to find located at the back of a business plaza.  With all the amazing reviews for Baguette Cafe I was excited to see what all the positive hype was about. Thankfully, Baguette Cafe did not disappoint! The restaurant was somewhat tricky to find located in the back of a business plaza but well worth the hunt.  The owner Oliver worked the register and asked if it was my first time at Baguette Cafe. When I said yes he excitedly went over the menu for me and explained the finer details. I ended up ordering a half and half \"The Chicken Sandwich\" and roasted red pepper soup. My girlfriend ordered \"The Chicken Salad\" and potato soup. The order arrived promptly and wonderfully presented on a small square plate and small colored cups for the soups. It looked so well made and dressed on the plate my excitement became overwhelming.  The chicken sandwich was delicious on a fresh, home made baguette, with cheddar cheese, tomato, mixed greens, bacon, superbly seasoned chicken, and a very nice tomato pesto. The ratio of meat, cheese, and bread was perfect and the sandwich oozed with flavor as it melted in my mouth. The red pepper soup was surprising. It tasted similar to a tomato basil which much more of a pepper kick. It had a light creamy taste very rich with flavor. It complimented my sandwich well. I had a bite of my girlfriend's combo and her salad, although dressed with a vinaigrette unsuitable for my tastes, had a nice flavor. Her soup was possibly the best potato soup I have ever had.  The cafe is welcoming and decorated with white walls, warm red-orange accents and yellow hanging light fixtures. It suits the establishment and their lunch driven menu well. The owner Oliver was very pleasant and assisted in the overall great vibe. The prices are very reasonable and go well with the perfectly sized portions. I had a great time at the Baguette Cafe and will surely return again.",

On multiple occasions there seems to be confusion about my order and slight attitude if I say anything. Other than that this place is awesome, definitely worth trying!

I've tried the egg baguette panini and the ham sandwich. The bread is always so fresh and perfectly grilled. The price is really good for the quality and quantity. The owner and the staff are really nice and always grateful. My favorite place in Las Vegas!",

The place has creative soups, sandwiches and salads.  The combinations are excellent.  The gazpacho is one of the best I have ever had.  Also love both the hot and cold sandwiches.  If I ate here more often I would have to see if they would accept direct deposit from my work.  IT IS THAT GOOD!!!",

We were greeted by a friendly Frenchman by the name of Oliver who turns out is the owner. I can't explain how refreshing it was to sit in his cozy little cafe with a delicious latte and the best croissant sandwich I've ever had after all the hustle and bustle of the strip and the casinos. I wish he would open a Baguette Cafe back home in Austin!!   Long story short, if you are a local and haven't been here yet you are seriously missing out. Anybody visiting the strip, you won't regret the short drive to check this place out!",

I'm so lucky to live nearby. I had the Blue Brie, and a plum tart, and was blown away by the taste. They really don't cut corners on the quality of the ingredients in every dish, from the entrees to the pastries, and even the beverages. It's not overly rich, everything is as fresh as possible, the prices are reasonable, and the food is so good it could be served at an expensive restaurant but the atmosphere is welcoming and unpretentious.

Olivier is the best.  He is funny, entertaining, charming,  and really makes you feel welcome.  Service is excellent and friendly all around.  This place gets super busy at lunch so go early or late,  or you may not get a table.  The seating inside is limited,  but they do have a lot of outdoor seating if the weather is nice.   I wish they would open on weekends,  but I understand the reasoning.",

You are warmly greeted as soon as you walk through the door. He has such a warm & light spirit and it makes coming into his restaurant a treat.   The only negative thing I have to say about our past experience was how busy it was...it was early January on a Sunday around 12:30pm (party of 4) and it was a little too cold to sit outside (where they have the majority of seating) but every table inside was already being used.    We ended up outside and thankfully a table of 4 finished right before our food came out so we quickly bussed the table and enjoyed the warmth.   The food was wonderful. I did 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup. The soup was broccoli and I am so glad I got to try it on a cold Vegas day. I choose the chipotle sandwich with chicken and it hit everything I had hoped from it.   Cheesy, creamy with a hint of spice!   I cannot wait to come back and try some other things off the menu!",

When I first got there I felt a bit out of place in my crop top and high-waisted shorts, which is my go-to casual wear. In a cafe full of businessmen and women, I felt that I should've worn my business casual wear. I tried to make conversation with a couple of people in line and they actually just stared at me like I was crazy.   So after feeling a bit awkward, I was kindly greeted by Olivier. He was so kind, asked me my name and even used my name twice before I took off. I didn't feel out of place any longer, I felt welcome. I ordered the Pesto grilled sandwich with chicken and bacon which was just absolutely delicious! Throughout my short wait for my to-go order I encountered such friendly staff. They were all working hard to get not only everyone's order but I felt like they were trying to specifically get me my order quick and with such wonderful hospitality. I left the place in such a great mood because of the environment they created for me. From someone that works in the hospitality industry, I can tell you that they do it with such ease and they are so real. On top of that, the food was delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try more!",

    "text": "MLK Day, 2014.  After having just finished a lovely holiday bike ride, I met up with two of my favorite foodie kiddos, Derek and Petra, and their moms since I knew they'd be off, too.  Long a Yelp bookmark, it was finally a great day to dine here since they're closed on the weekends.   After zig-zagging through the parking lot, I found the cafe.  Every table was taken and there was a short line at the register to order.  Thankfully, one party vacated while we were in line, so our party of five could sit down inside.  This place is very popular; after I checked in on Yelp, a plethora of recommendations were thrown my way in the comments section.  I was told to get the soup of the day, no matter what it was.  When I got to the register, Olivier, the friendly proprietor, told me the soups of the day were cream of zucchini with parmesan and cream of roasted pepper, but the latter wasn't ready just yet.  I chose a cup of the zucchini soup with a half of the 3 Cheese sandwich with added turkey for protein.  I spied the croissants behind Olivier and asked for one of those, too.  Petra ate the zucchini soup and Derek munched on a raisin croissant; these kids have good taste and that's why I eat with them a lot.  We all enjoyed our food, including the new acai bowl that's been added to the menu.   There was a steady stream of customers the whole time we were there and, in fact, the line was to the door by the time we left.  Word on the street is that Olivier is opening up another establishment and it will be open on weekends; if that's the case, I will certainly be back more often with the little partners in dine (and their moms).",

If you order your sandwich spicy, you might get an actual \"kick\" from him while he reads back your order. And his attitude flows into his entire staff, including his Mom. Everyone seems so happy to work there, even early on a Sunday morning.    The quiche is sublime (and I've never used this word before. I just couldn't think of a bigger superlative.) With fluffy filling and crust that is moist and buttery.  Don't forget the soups, which are subtly flavored but extremely well-developed. Everything is delicately flavored so don't expect big, bold tastes. They allow the natural flavors of the ingredients to come through. Try to think about a cafe for someone with a more refined palette.   The sandwiches are good, but unfortunately they pale in comparison to the fresh-baked croissants and quiche, so stay there. The smoothies, coffees and teas are strong also...but the quiche!  (Cue the angels choir)",

My favorite is the granola bowl which comes with fruit and a delicious jelly. It is a simple, delicious, health-concious choice. But done so well, you will want it again. I would also recommend the quiches.  Lovely little spot.",

    "text": "After 17 check in's, it somehow has slipped my mind that I have never reviewed this place.  Go figure!    Olivier is a doll.  I initially came back to this place on my way home from the doctor's office and hadn't been back in 2 weeks.  Immediately, he says, \"Hello, Kimberly.\"  (I had paid with a card the previous time.)  I was floored.  This place can get packed.  There are tons of regulars, and he remembered my name after I ordered a cup of coffee and a bottle of ginger ale one time to go?  My order changed from iced tea to go to a salad and iced tea for dining in.  I figured I could read through some things there.  He sees my laptop and asked if I needed wifi (free and secure).  It sounded good to me, and the password is just so upbeat and positive like the vibe you get in the shop.  As for the food, everything I have had there is DE-LISH!  I've eaten my way through the salads.  My favorite is the one with the jimica.  The soups change daily, so be sure to ask if the listed soups are for today.  All of the sandwiches and pastries are amazing.  Everything is always fresh and organic.  If you're there and the quiche isn't sold out try it!  Also, I've heard the chocolate twist are a must try.  (I don't like chocolate.  I know, I know.  Something is wrong with me.)  Lastly, the drinks...  The ginger ale that they carry is a favorite.  It's not homemade, but it has real ginger in it.  If you are a ginger lover, check it out.  The espresso and brewed coffee are both Illy.  I am not sure of the brand of iced tea, but it is fantastic and never over steeped.  I've also seen families come in on a three day weekend and order hot chocolate and swear that it's one of the best in the city.  I wouldn't know but wouldn't doubt it either.",

My son had a freshly baked croissant, which he LOVED... And my brother got a breakfast croissant that was delicious!!! Not only was the food great, but Oliver was super nice and very friendly and we even went back in after we were done eating to order some chocolate twists to take home... I'm soooo happy that my brother found this hidden gem- very excited to spend a lot of girls brunches here! Going to try the quiche next time! Yay!",

Inside was open with tables and a couch, however with it being beautiful outside and the patio seating had the perfect amount of shade we decided to enjoy our lunch outside.

I ordered the drip iced coffee and the pesto sandwich with chicken. The bread had a nice crunchy outside with a delicious chicken pesto middle. I had a bite of my boyfriends croissant and it was flakey and buttery, yum. It's a small place but definitely a new spot for my boyfriend and I. It reminds me of cafes in SoCal and it's something I've been looking for in Las Vegas. A lot of cafes here look nice but have 'ok-ish' food, but not here.

Their iced espresso- specifically the iced white mocha, wasn't my fave...but it wouldn't be right to judge their espresso/drinks based off of an iced drink. That's lie judging a sushi restaurant off of a California roll. Lol. So next time I will try one of their hot espresso because they actually looked really good!!",

They have a nice menu with breakfast and lunch selections. The menu includes a lot of coffee and tea selections as well as fresh juice. They offer pressed coffee  as well. They have indoor and outdoor seating.  I chose the egg croissant with added mushrooms for an extra $1.00. My husband chose the baguette panini egg with added ham for $1.00.  As we were standing in line there was a gentleman in front of me whom ordered the chocolate twist made from a croissant into a long, skinny pastry loaded with rich chocolate and cream. We added that to order too as there was only two left on the backing sheet behind the nice lady whom helped us sitting on the counter.  We added hot coffee to our order with rich cream and brown sugar.  We sat outside and shortly our pastry and hot coffee was brought to us. It was beyond delicious! The pastry was rich, creamy and flaky. The coffee was excellent and paired nicely with our pastry. Simply put, heavenly! Our breakfast sandwiches were brought out and it was hot, fresh and tasty. My croissant was superb with flaky crust and amazing flavor. My husband's panini baguette was tasty, melt in your mouth goodness.  This cafe is a rare find and is a place that draws repeat customers. We will definitely be returning to try more of their intriguing menu items.",

As other reviewers stated, it's in a business trip mall, away from the bustle of the strip. They serve Illy coffee which is a plus, service is great, and I like the vibe there. It's not trying to be \"cute, French or hip.\"  Having spent a total of 4 months in France and eating way more than my share of pastries and sandwiches, I can assuredly say, it's a detour and stop worth making if you're anywhere in the Vegas area.

Baguette Cafe is a little French cafe located 10 miles away from the Strip. Location was a bit difficult to find, but totally well worth it (hint: drive into the business park via Raphael Rivera Way).  Very friendly service. On a side note, one of the staff members misheard my order and accidentally gave me the wrong drink. Without realizing what was going on, I was somehow charged with extra amount of money. However, the staff recognized the mistake and gave me back the overcharged amount - so I really respect the staff's honesty here!   Blue Brie (mustard spread, apple, walnuts, blue cheese brie, and the choice of mushrooms or chicken, $7.96): I got mushroom blue brie and this grilled sandwich was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Crispy crust and fresh ingredients - talk about delicious!  Quiche du Jour (bacon and swiss cheese quiche or vegetable quiche, $5.46): I got bacon quiche and I was really impressed! It was seasoned very well and texture was so fluffy. This is a must order!  Thank you Yelp for leading me to this incredible French cafe. On my next Vegas trip, I might even steal my friend's rental car just so that I can come back here again!  P.S. - It is ranked No.21 on the Yelp's top 100 places to eat (<a href=\"http://officialblog.yelp.com/2014/02/yelp-data-reveals-top-100-places-to-eat-bookmark-these-babies-now.html\">officialblog.yelp.com/20...</a>)",

It's friendly yet very slooooooww.....In 2017, I have dined at Baguette Cafe three (3) times for lunch. Twice on a weekday & once on the weekend. We know to go early in order to get a table & beat the crowds. It is a very popular lunch destination.   Each of (3) times, food items have come out in no particular order, so don't plan to actually dine with your table mates (pet peeve). Your companion will be through with their salad, before your sandwich arrives. Or their soup will get cold while politely waiting for your croissant to be put on the table.   Today, 1/2 our order didn't come out. They do not seem to serve \"first come first serve\", as has been sited by other reviewers. We had to go inside and ask for our order. Oh, and then go in again to fetch the silverware staff forgot to give us when we were in gathering our food the first time.  So if you want to try the cafe, lower your expectations to realize you will have extremely slow & haphazard service. You likely cannot make it your lunch in 1 hour. If you can roll with that, you may enjoy the meal.  I wish management would make a few changes to correct these service issues to make for an overall better experience. And, I wish they would realize it might be a good idea to get their weekday lunch service doable in less than 45 minutes for those who work..   I really do want to love this place. Bon Apetit.",

If I would have realized it I would have ordered the lunch sandwhich. There was lettuce on the plate with sloppy placed dressing. It was underwhelming. The reason it gets 4 stars is because of the friendly barista man who made an excellent vanilla latte with soy milk. I'd come back but just for coffee. (Also, there's a Pokemon gym and a Pokestop across the parking lot). Wanted to sit outside because it was gorgeous but they were repaving the parking lot, which smelled horrible. So I sat inside at their couch which is pretty comfy. Probably needs to be wiped up. But I know they were super busy.",

It's isolated and very mellow.  I came on my lunch break after all the great reviews I saw, I just had to try it. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She even let me taste the soups of the day because I couldn't decide which one to order. I went with the half Mushroom soup and half Chicken Chipotle grilled sandwich.   You can tell that the soup was just made and wasn't sitting around all morning. It wasn't too creamy and had good bold flavors. I am NOT a mushroom lover but this soup was really good. The sandwich was amazing. It is a pretty small half sandwich but it was a perfect size for me. But I think most of you should order a full sandwich. The bread was made from scratch. The ingredients tasted fresh. I also got a iced green tea which I really liked.   The owner, Olivier, was great! I went to talk to him about getting a menu to take with me but unfortunately he doesn't have any yet. He did grab my e-mail and he sent me a copy of the menu. When costumers would walk in he would automatically address them by their name. Now that's good customer service and it shows that he has regulars that come in for his amazing food. He even let me know that he uses all organic foods and meats are processed clean with no hormones. He said he really cares about what goes into the food, which I really appreciate.  I will definitely be returning again.",

I was greeted by the owner, Olivier, a very nice man who introduced me to the rest of the staff that day. Being it was my first time, he recommended the egg and croissant. I ordered mine with ham and also ordered a latte and a chocolate twist.   The croissant was excellent, so buttery and flaky. It was a delicious sandwich. My latte was yummy as well, especially because it was made with whole milk and I usually get mine nonfat. Baguette Cafe only offers whole milk, almond milk and soy milk.   The chocolate twist, although amazing, was too sweet for me and I couldn't finish it.  I think I would have loved the chocolate croissant.    I really enjoyed the warm ambience of the cafe.  Such friendly service made breakfast a delight!",

It is kind of in a weird place in the back of a business park off the highway...not exactly front and center and not exactly easy to figure out how to get to, but once you are there, it is like a little oasis of calm!   They have a nice menu of salads, sandwiches, fresh juice, coffee and sweets, quiche and other snacks. Three members of our party had sandwiches, all served on lovely fresh baguette with side salads. All of them were devoured without even an offer for anyone else to have a bite....I had their roasted veggie quiche of the day, which also came with a side salad, plus a fresh pressed green juice. I loved my meal - perfect amount, great flavor, fresh, and a good value for so much healthy food in one serving!  I also really liked the location - once you find it, there is plenty of parking, and there is indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is comprised of a bunch of tables under trees and umbrellas. The day we were here it was sunny and in the low 70s - extremely pleasant to sit outside and eat and enjoy the weather!   I am only giving 4 stars because it is a little tricky to find (we drove around for a good 10 min, in and out of plazas, trying to figure out how to get to it) and also because despite them giving us a number for our table, we received several orders for other people before they finally served us our food - so it seems their ordering system or their servers are very confused....and the food takes a little longer so be prepared to wait (however, it IS worth the wait!).",

The pastries tempted me, as they looked absolutely amazing, however with the new year and weight loss resolutions I asked the adorable lady at the counter for avocado toast, it wasn't on their menu however she was more than happy to take my order. I received a beautiful toasted baguette with a hearty portion of avocado with salt and pepper. Perfection. Without so much as a lifted brow my unique order was taken and served up hot and with a smile. I will certainly be back to try a menu item!",

    "text": "I first came here a year ago, only ordered the egg, ham, and swiss croissant. The wait was extremely long due to how busy they are compared to employees. The croissant was ok, wasn't enough for me to wait another 20+ minutes again.  So, a year later I decided to try this place again on a whim, realizing I had never even tried their coffee last time. I came before work, shortly after they opened. I still had a bit of a wait but it was closer to about 10 minutes this time. I ordered a starberry white chocolate muffin that they heated up and a hot white chocolate mocha. Both were delicious, I was pretty impressed with both. Usually when I find a good coffee place for some reason the pastries they have I usually don't care for so it was nice to have an actual good muffin without needing to go to a bakery.  I left this on a 4 star due to the wait still (only two people working and ringing). Although I was very satisfied with the coffee and muffin, desert wind coffee is on my way to work and tases just as good. They're also much faster and have a rewards program. If they had more people working I wouldn't mind stopping in here instead about once a week. However, with the wait that they have I'd have to actually wake up probably about 30 minutes earlier just to make enough time to stop here and it's just not worth it to me.  On the rare occasions I'm up early enough (as I was recently!) I'll consider stopping. If you live nearby and have some time, I'd definitely recommend stopping by.",

When we walked in, the owner was the one taking the orders. He asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, he explained the whole menu to us. He was SO personable! After we had gotten our food, he checked on our table outside to see how everything was. His service was outstanding, and I wish every place I went to had this great of service. It also helps that is french accent is to DIE for ;)  Ok, so onto the meal. I had the chicken pesto sandwich special. It was FULL of flavor. Sundried tomato pesto really made the whole sandwich pop. The bread was fresh, soft and chewy. It matched the sandwich perfectly. The chicken was delicious as well. It was perfectly cooked, and not dry. I seriously can't even say how awesome this place is!   My table also split the chocolate tart. Can you say HEAVEN? Cause that's where I was when I was devouring it. It's rich and creamy. The slice was HUGE, and enough for 4 people to share.  I kinda want to go back just for that!   If you haven't been here, you need to come STAT. Like I said, I wish it was open on the weekends cause I would be here every Saturday for lunch!",

As has been noted by some other reviewers, its a little tricky to find the place at first, in the far corner of a group of office buildings, but its well worth the effort.  I got there about 11:40 am which I think was perfect timing, since by the time my food came out almost every seat in the place was taken. The decor is very nice - simple but beautiful.  Normally small local cafes look pretty amateurish inside, but Baguette Cafe was done right.  Its warm and inviting and definitely a place you'd like to eat at or just have a cup of coffee in.   I decided to have a ham sandwich and a cup of their roasted pepper and gouda soup, both of which were very good.  I don't normally care for tomatoes but the sandwich was good enough that I actually enjoyed them.  The presentation of the plate was also very nice, with plates and bowls that were a cut above what you'd expect to find in most Vegas cafes.  Olivier, whom I take to the owner, was very nice and welcoming, introducing himself and asking me which nearby building I worked in (none of them, I live down the street) and asking my name when I left and shaking my hand - something you definitely don't get at most restaurants or cafes!  All in all I'm very impressed with Baguette Cafe and recommend anyone in the area (or out of it, its worth a drive) to give it a try.",

The only downside to this place is the hours of operation, only opened M-F during work hours, 7am- 5pm.   I just had the Bleu Brie sandwich today and it was delicious.  It was not my favorite though, since it was missing some kick to it.  Now what it specifically needs, I do not know.  I do love me some brie on baguette, though, yumm!  I really love the yellow curry chicken sandwich.  It's usually on the written menu.  If it is not, you can probably ask Olivier (I think that's his name, and I'm sorry if you're reading this - I forgot your name, but judging from what everyone else is writing, it looks like Olivier is your name) to make it for you.  I also like eating my sandwich in the cafe, since it comes with a palm-sized amount of salad.  It really is not a lot, but it's a very petite addition at no extra cost to your order.   I also had the quiche today, the one with bacon and swiss cheese.  I've been wanting to try it in the past, but they'd always be out.  I ate the quiche after the sandwich, and being somewhat full did not stop me from enjoying the savoriness of this quiche.    In the past, I had ordered a blended iced-coffee.  It wasn't as tasty as I like my iced coffee to be.  I usually like it on the stronger, chicory-esque, sweet side.  However, my coworker had one today, and she said it was good.     The cafe gets a bit busy during lunch time.  I have yet to see how the foot-traffic is during the mornings.  If you have a 30 minute lunch, then I would suggest calling ahead of time and placing an order, just to prevent from waiting in a line to order and then waiting for your food to be made.  The cafe is pretty decently sized, a bit on the smaller size, but it works.",

However, that doesn't seem to matter as it gets a lot of traffic regardless.  I went today for lunch (5/22/13) on the late side (about 4pm) and had the four-cheese and prosciutto panini. It comes with a really generous helping of fresh mozzarella, basil, and a tasty and tangy homemade tomato spread. They recently switched from ciabatta to baguette (apparently they hired an advisor before opening the restaurant who told them that Americans prefer softer breads to crunchy baguettes...that advisor was WRONG!). The new bread is amazing - very crunchy but soft on the inside, and even better when grilled in the panini press.  I also tried the artichoke soup (splendid) and a croissant (buttery and soft inside, flaky outside...perfect!). Every single thing I have ever tried on the menu has been delicious. They also make great smoothies and though I am not a coffee drinker, I am told their coffee is fantastic as well.  To top it all off, the owner, his family, and employees are the nicest people:) I'll definitely keep coming back! I just hope they open another location...",

You'd think you were eating at some fine dining French restaurant.    But the best value was the $3.04 Chocolate Tart.  After the first bite, I teleported to heaven and back in a few seconds.  If you are ever going to cheat on your diet, put this on your list of things to eat.  Value-wise, you can't beat it.    When we were there, there were 4 new customers coming in.  (5 including me and 3 of us found out from Yelp)  This place is getting good buzz and for good reason.  Also, very affordable.  I wish they were open on Saturday.

I ordered a Prosciutto Salad w/ fruit cup and my 2 co-workers each ordered a chicken sandwich.   From what I heard from my co-workers, the sandwich was just a normal sandwich, nothing special at all. My salad was pretty a normal mixed green salad with a few pieces of prosciutto and salami. Nothing special there either. BUT their salad dressing, or whatever that supposed to be, was just disgusting. I have no idea what it tasted like except for bad taste.   As far as the service go... the server did notified the party in front of us for a 20-25 minutes wait for their panini.   But none of us ordered a panini and she didn't notified any of us, we waited for 25 minutes for the sandwiches. Remember, it was just a normal sandwich w/ nothing special at all.  Then my salad didn't come with the sandwiches for which the server said she would bring it right out. I assumed it was just too much for her to bring at the same time. So I waited... a few minutes later, my salad was still not there. So I went in and follow up. And this is our conversation...  Me: Hi, I would like to follow on my salad. It was taking a bit long.  Server:  I said I will bring it right out!  um... excuse me... Last time I checked, you said the same thing 5 minutes ago!   Seriously, how hard is it to just put some greens together and the meat on top? 30 minutes in total? For just an average salad? Not worth it at all. My co-workers and I both agree not to go back EVER AGAIN!  We are from SoCal, this place only qualify for an average meal but not worth the wait.  Also, we had to sit outside because it was way too hot inside. The owner is SMART enough to the oven in the room but not the kitchen...  BTW, just a little tips here... If you come here on a windy day and planning to have a salad. I would suggest you not to sit outside or your salad will be flying all over the place. It's not even funny, it's real.",

    "text": "I find it very refreshing to find a locally owned business such as Baguette Cafe.   I came right as they were closing and the owner Olivier hooked it up with a deal on some of the baked goods.   There was something heavenly about the croissant. Even if it had been sitting all day since it was baked and was past it's freshness prime and a bit cold it maintained a crunchy flaky exterior while having a tender bite and slightly chewy texture on the inside. If this is what the croissant becomes after a few hours it must be ten times as better fresh.  The soup, Mexican vegetable, was just absolutely divine. The soup it self could stand up on it's own but when you bite into the large cuts of assorted vegetables the melodies of the ingredients along with the broth just melds together in your mouth. The bits of lime in the soup add an excellent touch as they're able to retain their individual characteristic.  The pannini press was cold and it would have taken too much time to fire it up again so i asked for a cold chipotle chicken sandwich. Two more snags, they ran out of sun dried tomatoes and there was no more baguette bread which they normally use to make the sandwiches. I informed them it was fine and if there was anything they could do. Tomatoes were taken out and the sandwich was constructed on this roll. I took the foil wrapped sucker home and baked it in my toaster oven for about 10 minutes. WHOA!! What ever that roll was i want more of it. The crust was just absolutely divine. Crunchy and chewy and satisfying. Actual slices of chicken breast were used instead of deli sliced and the sauces were tasty. Could have used a bit more of a spicy kick but they this is a modified version.  I came here during their closing process and as a result got the day's leftovers. The left overs pretty much made my day. The bread is absolutely divine and the soup needs the skills of a poet to properly give it credit.   If you are to come here and try this place out i would come at opening time (0700) when everything is fresh.",

Next I had the Prosciutto and Salami sandwich on a croissant which I ate v-e-r-y slowly because it tasted so good I didn't want it to end...LOL. And to finish everything, I had the decadent melt-in-your-mouth Chocolate Tart for dessert. Did I mention the absolutely wonderful people behind the counter??   I'm excited for my next visit!",

The prices are great  (4.02 for an exquisite  croissant  with egg and swiss  cheese!) and the service  is superb.  Olivier, the owner, offered  us a \"tour\" and explained  us the menu, showed us the amazing quiche in the oven and welcomed  us like family (mind you, this was our first visit ). We plan on making this spot our new weekend  breakfast place. Highly, highly recommend!",

Had never had lunch here so The Chicken was new territory.  Even setting aside the fabulous fresh-baked baguette (and why would you want to?!?), this sandwich was the funk.  Fresh pesto, chicken and tomatoes.  That's what I'm talking about.  People on the plane were pretty jealous.  Beats the heck out of crappy airport food any day!",

The owner was extremely nice and although there was a long line, he didn't make me feel like he was rushing for me to order at all. And to go above and beyond he even came OUTSIDE to where we were sitting to talk to us.   Next is the food. I tried the chicken curry sandwich and chicken pesto sandwich. Both of which were the best sandwiches I've ever had. I've never had chicken as soft as the ones in these sandwiches. Everything was great. My boyfriend also got their latte which was sitting in an open cup outside through our whole meal and was surprisingly still hot at the end when we poured it into a to go cup. Overall, I will be coming back!",

Great marinated chicken-CHECK Fresh ingredients--CHECK  The owner is actually from France and we shared a bonding moment when I saw he had Vietnamese fish sauce (Vietnamese food IS french and Chinese fusion basically).

    "text": "Tucked into the corner of a business complex, Baguette Cafe may be a little difficult to find (even with the maps posted on Yelp)  but well worth the search. It is a small, cozy spot that gets rather busy during the lunch hour.   I met Christie O. for lunch recently, at 11 am there was ample seating to choose from but within the hour, every seat inside was taken and there were even some patrons seated outside.   Baguette Cafe is owned by an amazingly friendly and highly skilled chef named Olivier. He was in back when we arrived, but we received very friendly service from the sweet employee manning the counter... and Olivier came out a little later to say hello and ensure everything was to our liking. What a charmer that man is!  Baguette Cafe is serving up BIG time taste at really inexpensive prices... My lunch was a half a sandwich (tuna salad), a cup of soup (cream of sweet potato) and a large iced tea, and it cost under $10! The soup was lick-the-cup delicious and the baguette that the sandwich came on was perfectly chewy without being hard. The portions are not huge, but for me it was the perfect amount of food.   While I am not vegan, it is always nice to see places that care enough to offer up vegan selections for those that are. Most menu items can be altered to accommodate different dietary requests.   I definitely look forward to another lunch at Baguette Cafe, and I think the next time I go in, I will have to try some of the baked desserts Christie and others have raved about!",

Staff is super friendly and helpful. Olivier introduced himself, and helped me pick from the menu, since I was struggling because everything looked so good. Then I chatted a little bit with him about our origins (France him, Spain me). I also met Nicole, another staff member, who was equally as friendly as Olivier. I ordered the Blue Brie, a combination of flavors and textures that was so delicious! I also had a tropical green tea, iced, which was just the perfect pairing to my baguette. I am definitely going back to try the rest of menu items :D",

    "text": "Items Selected: Chocolate Torte Croissant Chocolate Twist Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Banana Nut Chocolate Chip Muffin Financier  Highly praised by locals and viewed from the highway on my Monday to Wednesday commute the lone factor preventing me from visiting Olivier Brouillet's \"Baguette Cafe\" to date was the weekday only hours, an understandable choice given the restaurant's business-park locale but a pity for those living within the somewhat Un-Vegasy constraints of a 7:30a-5:00p Monday through Friday schedule.  Small in size but airy in decor it was just after eight o'clock on a PTO Monday with family in town that our trio made way into the brightly lit room and with a few locals lingering over coffee as fresh baked goods stocked a small pastry case it was mere seconds before Olivier greeted us with a smile, our affirmation to his \"first time?\" inquiry leading to a full description of nearly every item ready or soon to emerge from the kitchen and our eventual order comprising the majority of them.  Admittedly intrigued by the sandwiches but preferring to focus on pastry it was with mild disappointment that Illy was the only brew offered as I find their over-roasted beans poorly suited for much but with this small quibble aside the glut soon to arrive would by-and-large impress, the simple  croissant on par with those of Paris as shattering layers gave way to echoing caverns of butter while four items laced with high quality chocolate each proved superlative - the crispy rimmed cookie near-molten at its core and the torte rich in taste but ethereal in texture.  Not quite as impressive or diverse as Bonjour Bakery, La Belle Terre, or Thomas Keller's Bouchon but featuring a combination of great pastry and lovely service that sets it apart Baguette Cafe is every bit the local gem that many have claimed and although hours and coffee will prevent frequent visits I've no doubt I'll find my way back eventually if not for a full meal at least for thing; an almond financier beyond my superlatives warrants any presumed hassles of location or time, even rush-hour on the 215.",

    "text": "This cafe is a hidden gem in Las Vegas! It's a small space but there's plenty of tables (and even a couch) inside, as well as a courtyard area with tables to sit outside. I guess the people who own this came from France, so the cafe is themed accordingly with a very quaint feel. Their menu is pretty expansive, offering breakfast, lunch (sandwiches), smoothies, and of course plenty of coffee and teas. I ordered the croissant and egg breakfast sandwich, and WOW I don't know what they put in it but it was phenomenal. I also ordered the mango smoothie to go with it, and that was delicious as well. The service was excellent too - you can tell it's a mom and pop kind of place, rather than your typical chain coffee shop like you see everywhere in Vegas. And even though the location is kind of hidden (they're located in a business plaza), they were busy the entire time we were there! My friend who brought me there also mentioned the few times she's been she's noticed the regulars are usually French, and speak French to the owners! Which I thought showed the cafe's authenticity. Everything here is fabulous, I will most definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

The waitress was really nice, I wish I remembered her name, she explained the items on the menu to us. My boyfriend ordered the chipotle baguette sandwich, which was grilled too, and I got the vegan version of that. Then , he ordered the quiche Lorraine as well. And I ordered the vegan tomato soup which was also amazing. Overall, this place is great, the food is delicious and I highly recommend it!",

Ive read the reviews for months and every time I find myself deciding where to eat I somehow forget to include this in my list of options. Its located in a business park which accounts for 70% of my inability to see it while driving down the road. But I assure you, 3 seconds after walking in the door I immediately recognized what all the hype is about.  And all of it is well deserved.   The owner is working behind the counter and has no reservations abouts welcoming every patron walking in the door. Despite being busy, he took the time to explain the menu in fairly good detail. Hes undoubtedly one of the most pleasant individuals ive ever encountered,  especially in the service industry.  His disposition alone would bring me back. But the food itself is an amazingly executed blend of french and american flavor combinations that sets this establishment far above the rest. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich.  And it was devine. Without a doubt, one of the best ive ever eaten. Regardless of where you live in the city, its a necessity that you give this place a try.",

And you can't expect them to kill themselves by working weekends and longer daily hours.  I would love to stop by on a Sunday morning, but not at the expense of their well-being.",

It is a little bit hard to find as you can see the sign from the 215 going west,so you have to actually exit durango and make a right on sunset. It is located at the end of some office buildings. You can also access it from the frontage road and make a right. The owner,Olivier is very charming and will recommend you what to have if you are unsure. I had a Cafe Mocha which was served in a big porcelain cup and was very delicious. They serve Illy cafe which is an excellent espresso. I took Olivier's suggestion and ordered the chicken curry sandwich.I asked for it to be a little bit spicy. I was not disappointed at all as the sandwich turned out to be one of the best chicken currys i've had. I would recommend you sit outside if the weather permits.   Overall great experience,great staff,excellent food and drink selection!",

    "text": "Just like the greatest gifts, this was a review I was hesitant to share with others since a part of me wanted to keep it for myself!  Having read all the stellar reviews, I had to see for myself if this was truly the cat's pajamas.  I currently live in Henderson and given that I usually have to go into the office at 8AM, I got up an extra half hour early just so I could make the trek across town to check out this oasis of French bakery nirvana hidden within a sterile collection of office buildings.    Upon walking in, I was momentarily levitated by the smells of fresh baked croissants and Illy coffee much like those 80s cartoons where the streams of smoke coming from a pie or turkey physically grabbed one's nose and dragged them over to the prize.  The folks working behind the counter include a charming young Frenchman appropriately named Olivier along with his mother, a retired pastry chef in France brought out of retirement to help his son run the business over the past few years.  My primary objective was to sample the pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant) but I found out from Olivier that they typically are not ready until about 830 since they require a different temperature to bake in their limited ovens.  That kind of attention to detail sold me to the fact that these were True artisans (In the words of Ron Burgundy to Baxter upon finding out he pooped in the refrigerator....\"Heck, I'm not even mad....that's amazing!)   I happily opted instead to sample their regular croissant combined with spinach, egg, swiss cheese, sundried tomato pesto, and black forest ham accompanied by a regular cup of Illy coffee (although the Almond roca mocha will be tops on my list for my return visit).  Having had memorable croissants made by bakers trained in France in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco, I must say this one holds up.   Irresistibly flaky, one should best lean forward when biting into this paragon of buttery perfection at the risk of scattering croissant confetti all over one's clothes.  Throw in a rich dark brew of Illy coffee and pleasant conversation with Olivier (I found out he will occasionally brew his own hemp milk for the customers, which apparently has all sorts of health benefits and is very delicious.....how unbelievably cool is that?), and you're well on your way to starting your day on a an impossible high.  I am literally contemplating moving to the SW part of town just so that this place can be a regular morning pit stop en route to work...crazy, right?  It's that good.",

    "text": "I've just had a flash of horror - HORROR! I've never reviewed Baguette Cafe? But-but-but... it's the best restaurant in Las Vegas! I was there just twice last week!  This is the restaurant that made me say, \"I've got to go to France.\" This is the restaurant my sandwich-avoiding husband never says \"no\" to... and the menu is mostly sandwiches.   My fave is the grilled eggplant panini and whatever the daily soup is. (The onion soup - so often made with beef stock elsewhere - is vegetarian here! And the little toasted bread slices they serve with the soup - crunchy and chewy at once? Mmm!)   The three-cheese panini is also tasty, which is saying something because I find gorgonzola to be unacceptably strong except in itty-bitty amounts. But this is the sandwich that made me say, \"Okay, this is why people like stinky cheeses.\" (Everything about Baguette Cafe makes me chatty.)  The bread.... ahh.... (I'm speechless. Gotta get to France. Gotta get to France.)  Oh, and don't miss the cream of carrot soup with coconut milk and fresh ginger. (Which I see, as I type, gets name-checked in other reviews. In what world is carrot soup such a star?! In a world where everything at the Baguette Cafe tastes like sparkling mouth-magic!)   Look, I'm not a soup-fiend. I like soup, but I don't take a detour for it, not on a buffet line and not on the road... until Baguette Cafe. I find myself wondering - from my home a mere crow mile away - what the day's soup is and, shazam, next thing you know I'm hanging out by the counter, watching Olivier (the master of the magic), Olivier's mom (so friendly, so skilled), and the ever-enthusiastic Shelby do their thing.  And on days when their \"thing\" includes quiche, my husband does the eye-flutter of bliss. \"The best I've had in my life,\" he says.  I'm not sure I'm exaggerating when I say this is the best food in Las Vegas. Yes, it's in a strip mall in an office park. No, it's not fancy inside (but it is very clean, comfortable, with the option outdoor seating). Yes, the menu is mostly soup and sandwich-based (but with smoothies and frou-frou coffee drinks and a case full of delicious, delicious cookies, muffins, and French pastries). No, you can't visit after 5 o'clock (and that's probably why there isn't a line across the parking lot).  Heaven knows we have so many wonderful places to eat in this city, but the taste here is really special, bringing a non-stop complexity of \"umami\" - a word I hate to use (buzzword bingo!), but which perfectly describes the fullness of flavour in every bite of anything you get here.  Add a bottle of ginger ale from the \"Fresh Ginger\" people, a spicy nearly \"ginger brew\"-type drink where you can see the ginger and sugar sediment at the bottom of the pale liquid, and your lunch will be complete.",

I had the breakfast combo which was egg omelet bacon panini, OJ and coffee. My dad had croissant and large coffee, mom had a huge portion of curry chicken quiche that she couldn't finish (my mom is tiny person, 4'9\" and 80 lbs! but she loves to eat, wonder where I get that from!) so we all shared our food, of course. The panini was not too bad, probably would order something else next time. Croissant, fresh out of oven, was delicious. Curry chicken quiche.. yummy! Seasoning was right on spot.   The pricing for all of us was under $16 I believe. My dad originally wanted to eat at one of those buffet on the strip and it was $15 per person for breakfast (but meh, I'm not a fan of buffets). Glad I took them to this place instead, my parents were pleased!",

If you take Sunset, you have to weave through a bunch of office buildings.. or you can access it off Raphael Riviera (Frontage Rd.)  It's a great spot for a quick and delicious lunch.  Sandwiches/Panini's are about 7 bucks a pop.  Portions aren't exactly huge, but it's definitely quality.  The cafe isn't large, but there is plenty of seating outside.  I came with a group of 4 and the workers and they scrambled to put tables together for us.  It was my first time there and the guy at the registered was warm and provided a bunch of information on each of the sandwiches.   Good service - much appreciated!  I got the Prosciutto baguette.  Good!  Fresh meat, great fixings such as bleu cheese and this walnut dressing.  All the flavors mixed beautifully!  The cajun chicken and tuna sandwich also got rave reviews from the people I was with.  Totally recommended if you have a chance to go there during your lunch hour.

My only complaints would be the size of sandwiches to price ratio and the celery on my salad was a bit worse for the wear.  We shared a cold prosciutto and salami sandwich and a hot chicken and goat cheese panino.  The bread was fresh, the ingredients were quality and everything was seasoned really nicely.  Yum.",

    "text": "You know what they say about first impressions.  You only have one chance to make one.  It started off well enough, ordering a simple chicken sandwich and an iced tea.  They handed me my tea right away.  Then my status as a customer went into a black hole somewhere... after about 20 minutes of watching other people get their orders, I inquired about mine.  No clue.  Finally someone figured out that they blew right past it.  So NOW they start to make my one chicken sandwich.  At this point, a \"sorry sir, have a cookie, let me refill your tea\" would have been nice.  Instead, I had to intercept another snot-nosed yuppie-assed customer who was trying to steal my chair, even though my stuff was still on the table.  I got my sandwich after 30 minutes only to be able to take it and go since my lunch was now over.  If I were to return, would I expect the same experience?  I doubt it, since one of the reasons I tried this place was the reviews.  But like I said -- there was your one chance for a first impression.",

I had the pleasure of experiencing the roasted veggie quiche and the eggplant sandwich and must say both were very flavorful. The roasted veggie quiche was not dry and contained a nice crispy crust. The eggplant sandwich also contained a nice toasted baguette with a soft delicious center. The coffee here was delicious as well. I don't regularly drink coffee black but I definitely enjoyed their black coffee. Definitely a great place for breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is delightful as well playing nice tunes while you enjoy your meal.",

Olivier was ringing people up and he was super friendly. The cafe itself is small, cute, and clean. I loved the patio seating. Even though it's located in a business center, you don't really feel like it at all.   I ordered the Blue Brie and leek-potato soup. My bf ordered he Moroccan and a smoothie. Everything was delicious! I LOVE the bread the sandwiches come on. I guess they make it fresh daily. It has a nice crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. It's just perfect for sandwiches. Both sandwiches were great but I preferred the blue brie. I really want to try the Chipotle the next time I go.   The food is all very flavorful and tastes fresh.

    "text": "Another 5 star review for Baguette Cafe! What's not to like about this charming establishment? The location, maybe, although the journey there makes the reward even more satisfying.  I had been once before to sample a couple of sandwiches and the service was spectacular! The curried chicken sandwich was creamy and bold, while the basque pork sandwich had an entirely rustic profile.  Fast forward 8 months- I needed a place to study while munching something delicious and didn't want to end up in a Starbucks. I remember how much I loved Baguette Cafe months ago and decide to head there for lunch. Olivier actually remembers me (crazy!) and once again provided such a charming and personalized interaction. Ever helpful, and always ready to make a suggestion for those who are most indecisive (me). He noticed I had my laptop with me and right off the bat gave me the wifi password. Even the guy who delivered my food was funny, very helpful and got me more hot water for my tea as well as a slice of the peach custard tart so I wouldn't have to wait in line again.  On my most recent visit I tried the breakfast croissant with tomato instead of any meat. The flakiest croissant (baked fresh that morning, naturally) filled with a tomato jam and omelet style eggs filled with swiss and spinach. It came with a little salad (mostly a garnish) on the side, and was just right. It was satisfying, but light enough for me to still have room for that delectable peach tart afterwards. While the peaches aren't fresh, the custard is surprisingly eggy in a pleasant way, and the crust was just tender enough.  The chocolate tart looked amazing, dense and decadent, but I decided I'm saving that one until my next visit when I can pawn half of it off on a friend =)  It certainly won't take another 8 months for me to return.",

    "text": "Still 5* all the way, but after eight visits in five months from the extreme NW for the exquisite food, customer service and above and beyond caring: UPDATE!   Olivier is as charming and caring about real, healthy, whole food options as ever. His parents work side-by-side with him: I LOVE that. I'd not been back since their early September holiday and even the cashier remembered the size and addition of ginger to my Green Juice.   Yesterday was my Dad's first visit, though we have brought him take away before. He was enamored with the Proscuitto sandwich  with salami, fresh mozzarella greens, nuts and bleu cheese. As a Sicilian, he is very picky about his charcuterie and loved it. Olivier's Mom kindly explained to Dad that Proscuitto does not fare well with panini (heat press) and she was right; it tends to dry out the delicate meat. He also enjoyed Virgil's Zero Cola with Stevia: another testament to Olivier's belief in healthy, organic, non GMO product. As an 80%er in Clean Eats, his breads are the perfect spot to blow that 20% carb wad; reminds me of Baguettes you pick up at market in Paris, perfect combination of crunchy, light and chewy. Who could ask for more?  On previous visits and in correspondence, he had suggested and espoused the virtues of Coconut Oil in treating Alzheimer's. He was delighted to hear the folks are using it, and gave advice about other uses and types to incorporate into wellness lifestyle.  Was also not surprised he met two couples I know the day before; and remembered where they sat outside and their names!   He truly cares for and remembers each and every customer, and trains his employees the same. This is why only recently he has decided to follow his dream of a wine Bistro in an adjacent store which will have extended hours. He does not want to expand and lose the personal touch they impart into every customer interaction.   Chef always makes two soups daily and one is vegan. The offices, hospital and local Doctors offices order frequently en masse. Yet despite my pleas, he doesn't have a website, printed menu or even a business card. Food, family and healthy living are his passions. Maybe someday we will talk PR seriously, but humility is part of his charm. There is currently a spot on their Facebook page to vote for them in Chase's $250K neighborhood business grant program. Can't think of a more worthy choice.   As we left yesterday, he was introducing a new client to the menu as he always does; but he stopped me and handed me a Financier that was indescribably perfect. Looks like a mini pound cake, but lighter than air, almond flour based and not too sweet. Mom the chocoholic LOVES the chocolate tart, as I do because he uses 80% cacao, giving it a dark chocolate and not cloyingly sweet taste. Every special item he has presented from his pastry offerings have been nothing short of perfect and worthy of extra cardio :) He follows Yelp and always thanks you for patronage and feedback.   I drive far to enjoy his creations and dedication and am happy to have turned friends on to this delightful spot. Again, every menu item can be modified for any dietary concerns and be delicious. It is not for \"Super Size\" it folks. But, as in France, you get just enough of everything to be sated and not sporting a Food Baby.   Merci Beaucoup, Olivier for being a wonderful person, Chef and advocate for fabulous food health, social responsibility and animal rights. See you soon!  Yelp 100 Challenge",

    "text": "Yikes...I feel like a complete odd ball for giving this place anything less than 5 stars like the rest of the Yelp world. Really...I wish Yelp gave 1/2 ratings because it's really a 3 1/2 stars.  NOTE: Baguette Cafe is located in a large business commercial center. It's quiet with lots of tall business buildings everywhere. You may think BC is located at some plaza past this center but no....it's in here!! From reading reviews, I know plenty of Yelpers who have gotten lost or had to circle multiple times around the block to get to this place.   Service was fantastic and the food was good. Notice I said the word \"good\" but not \"delicious\" or \"out of this world!\" The owner, Oliver, greeted me with a warm welcome. I let him know this was my first time here due to finding this place out through Yelp and he gave me the run-down of the menu. He explained what specials he had for the day, what soups were available, and what are some of the popular items.  I ordered the half soup, half sandwich combo. One of the soups of the day was Potato Leek. It was perfect for the chilly weather. Soup came out pippin hot! I loved it. The sandwich was good but nothing special. I've honestly had better sandwiches at Panera Bread. My meal cost me about $7 and some change. Pretty typical for soup and sandwich combo (just like Panera) but the portions were more on the small side. It BARELY got me full and I normally have a small appetite. So I can't imagine a grown man getting full off of this. Maybe if you order two entrees then yeah.... I really don't get what's the hype about this place. It's simply A-Ok.  Also, there were hardly any seats/tables available inside. So be warn if you're going to dine in during peak hours. There's seating outside but nobody wanted to be out there on such a cold day.",

Cons:  There is generally a decent wait during the lunch hour rush, but what would you expect from an extremely tasty place? There is limited indoor seating for the cold winter months and hot summer days, it gets cramped fast, but luckily there is additional seating in the outdoor patio area for the many months of nice weather we get here in Vegas.  Pros: Pretty much everything you could want in a local cafe. It's authentic, you walk in the door and are immediately greeted by Olivier, such a polite gentleman who is happy to explain menu items and has great suggestions. There are always two made from scratch soups brewing, and there hasn't been one yet I disliked, sometimes I come just for a bowl of soup! The croissants and pastries are DELECTABLE; make-you-want-to-order-another delicious! They use quality coffee beans and train their baristas well, which means one tasty and most importantly correctly-brewed cup of joe. This locally owned shop is a True gem, serving up wholesome food in a quaint setting.  Bravo Olivier!",

At the register, Olivier rattled off a bunch of ingredients after I asked him what specialty drinks he can make. I picked the chocolate frosted almond as the main ingredient for my latte and asked him to make me a drink that's not too bitter and not too sweet. He then made the drink and asked me to taste it to see if it's to my liking. It was just perrrrrrfect! Olivier you rock!  I also ordered a vegetable quiche that smelled like rosemary and filled with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, spinach and egg. Delish! I'm totally coming back here when I'm in the Rhodes Ranch area.",

    "text": "Baguette Cafe can take all of money and I'd be totally okay with that. I come here quite often and it's because of their croissants. I am currently salivating just thinking about the buttery and flakey goods! Whenever I order a sandwich, I also substitute the baguette with the croissant; it's life changing and I can't get enough! Being the carb queen that I am, I pick up a chocolate twist once in a while too.  As for the drinks they offer, I can say their fresh juices and smoothies are just as delicious. I am big fan of their mango smoothie. It pairs well with their salads. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so I can't rave about that, but I've heard good things from friends.  One thing that is annoying about coming here is that it gets packed during the lunch hour. It's a small space and usually one cashier so if you're in a rush, I would avoid coming around 11:00-12:30. Other than that, there's not a single thing to dislike about Baguette Cafe. It's affordable, the food is tasty, and owner is friendly. What's not to love?!   Ugh! Writing this review made me so hungry.. I need a croissant now.",

    "text": "Olivier is the very best, and his skills and friendliness added with the finest illy supplied arabica beans makes Baguette Cafe the very best coffee shop.   The location is hard to find due to it being in a business park. But it is like a hidden gem or a treasure. Once you have found the shop, the rewards are worth it.   Think about it... walking into a friendly warm atmosphere with fresh croissant and coffee aroma in the air then greeted by the most friendly coffee shop owner ever then enjoying a nice cup of illy coffee or a small parisian meal, life is so beautiful.   I have been to sunrise and sambalatte and sunrise was my favorite before but as it is growing, I feel less connection with the coffee shop (I believe coffee shops should provide not only delicious coffee, but also interaction and lifestyle). I found Baguette cafe from a friends recommendation and now it is the only place I would go for coffee. (oh and sambalatte... they are always too crowded for the barista or cashier's interaction, they feel cold and cocky)  Nice coffee + nice atmosphere + the very best owner/barista. What more can you ask for?  100/5 rating.  P.S. Everything on the menu is delicious (from quiches to soups)",

The servers are always happy (not the creepy kind you see at most food places and pretty much the opposite of what people you see playing at the slots at casinos RiPepperonis).

The coffee depends on which barista you get (as with any place) but is always great, at worst. The music, location, food and service are far beyond anything you'll find elsewhere in Vegas. When I first found it a few years back I started going a couple times a week and now I'd say I frequent the place even more! -never gets old.  I heard Olivier's mum makes fantastic crepes and hope to see them with some smoked salmon options on the menu soon.  You don't need to go to France for fantastic food like this when it's right next to the 215 & Durango.",

Unfortunately they are open business hours and M-F only which is a downside if you don't work or live in the area. As far as the food-it is top notch and my absolute favorite place to get a sandwich. I feel the ingredients used are fresh. I love any panini that includes the eggplant. It is well cooked and flavored.   I also love the soups. Every soup I have tried has been pure deliciousness. I've been told they are all homemade and you can tell.   I also enjoy their iced tea choices. I appreciate a restaurant that has brewed flavored tea, not just the plain unsweetened black tea.   One time they messed up my order and gave me the wrong order and I did not notice until I was at home. I called to tell Oliver and he offered a free sandwich the next time I come in. That is good customer service and I liked that a lot.  This place has kept me coming back for more every chance I get when I am not working. If they had longer hours and weekend hours I would probably be here more often.   I can tell the owners passion every time I have come in here. He is always talking to his customers and is genuine with them.",

I came here because they were on Yelp's top 100 places to eat list and I can clearly see why.   This cafe is hidden on the side of a few business buildings, but it was not hard to find at all. The staff were super friendly and I can see that everything was prepared and baked fresh daily. Another plus was the patio area they had for seating. It was very clean and had just the right amount of shade. It is a great setting for casual brunch with friends. After debating between a lot of great choices, I ended up getting the Croissant, egg, and ham sandwich. You can either have this just with egg or pick a protein of choice. And I have to admit that this was the BEST croissant sandwich I have every had. I recommend this to anyone to comes here! The croissant was extremely fresh and flaky, and I really liked the sauce/dressing they added into the egg. The sandwich was also paired with a nice salad on the side and I also order a fresh orange juice; both of which were equally enjoyable as well. I will definitely be back to try the other baked goods next time I am in town!",

The atmosphere and workers were just so nice that I decided to stay there instead, even if just for a few minutes.  Their menu is pretty good as is, then when you're ready to order, they bust out their fresh hidden menu of goodies they decided to make that morning. I snagged a quiche with a late and it was epic! I will try to make it a point to stop before work some mornings to start the day off right!",

The mocha was good but the croissant was phenomenal, the perfect balance of flaky and tender.  The only con is that I don't actually eat a lot of the items on the menu, but I am definitely going to go back more often.",

    "text": "I'm a True night owl at heart and I was so looking forward in trying this place that I literally set my alarm clock to wake up super early to beat the lunch crowd here.  The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.  I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the \"fire\" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest.   I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal.   From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that.   I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good.   This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee.   Even though it might be challenging to find this cafe, you'll be happy you took the journey to find it.",

If you do decide to come often, you too will start to notice - the soups, sandwiches, even desserts are Not made the same way each time! That is a good thing! There are variations on ingredients that keep the palate alive and guessing. Today I had 2 things which are superb. One of them is not even on the menu yet. SO, I hope you too can get it - Pesto Vegetarian Spinach Wrap with pesto, cilantro, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and mushrooms and it was grilled! Plus the wrap was pesto too.... Simply delicious :)  For dessert, I had Chocolate Pudding Tart. It was sweeter, yummier than ever before. Olivier's mum told me, it had more cream than chocolate and that she was adjusting the recipe. Kiki and I ate it in under a minute! Mouthwatering, mind-boggling goodness. We also ate the Prosciutto Salad - my bill came to a whopping $13 dollars! Then Olivier gave us 2 breakfast pastries to take home. I shook his hand, and told him sadly that I would not be seeing him till Monday. It is getting busier here. There are tables outside. Both in front, and on the side. The side tables sit in the sun. One of the very few outdoor cafes in Vegas. It will be a good year for Baguette Cafe is my prediction.",

If you enjoy staring at a parking lot and reminded of work, this is your place. The food was OK, I've been here a few times. It's a bit over priced, very small portioned (the key ingredients a starbucks sorority girl loves), but I suppose they have to squeeze every penny out of each patron. So what's up with the one star review? I got food poisoning. Bad. I ordered their quiche de jour (lorraine) which unmistakably is what made me terribly ill. I should have cancelled the order when I saw the quiche on the counter not refrigerated, then cut to be warmed. I didn't, probably because I was tired from hiking and didn't want to get into it. Besides, I'm well traveled in undeveloped countries and have a very strong stomach. Like other foods I'd ordered, it was simply alright. Unlike other meals, this was a hospital visit. Never again.",

The location is somewhat difficult to find as it's tucked away behind some commercial buildings, but once we went in and tried the apple tart and pain au raisin, I was hooked -- too bad it was my last day on vacation in Vegas. But, Olivier said to come back in the morning to try the breakfast pastries and I was blown away, I bought all the pain au chocolat and we enjoyed them in the car as we headed back to Salt Lake City.  It is worth your time to find this little cafe, go there for a nice dessert, treat of authentic French breakfast -- the sandwiches don't look half bad either!",

Well, my wish came True.  I kept hearing about Baguette Cafe and my girlfriend and I finally decided to stop by and try it out.  Little hard to find at first as it is tucked away in a business complex but so glad we tried it!  It was everything I had hoped for with even better customer service.  The staff were all so warm and welcoming and the food was simply amazing.  They also have the best iced white mocha I've ever had.  My new favorite spot.  This is where I'll bring all my friends when they come in town.  What's so funny is I just got here, one of the first people in and I greeted them saying I'm so excited (to eat here).  The very next person to arrive just said the same thing haha... I guess I'm not the only one.",

I drove all the way to the other side of town just to see what the hype was all about and I was not disappointed. The place is a little hard to find because its surrounded by a complex with business buildings and banks.  The owner there is so nice and friendly, it was nice to see an owner take so much pride in his business. He actually whipped up a Moroccan chicken sandwich for us. It was a grilled chicken sandwich on a baguette with goat cheese and roasted peppers, the flavor combinations were delicious. I also got a small cup of shrimp bisque and the green tea frappe, which was very refreshing. I didn't get to try any of the desserts they had there since I was already full but I will definitely be going back soon to try them.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how I haven't written a review about Baguette Cafe. In some ways there's little praise that hasn't been heaped on the culinary wonders that lie in this hidden gem at the back of a business plaza off Sunset road just north of the 215 beltway.  My wife well knows my aversion to sandwiches for the evening meal, but the \"chipotle\" baguette gets a special pass into my tummy at every opportunity. The quality of everything - the chicken, the bread, the aioli could be straight out of a Michelin star restaurant and here you have a solidly sized, artisan sandwich available for little more than the uninspiring fare served up by Subway or Port of Subs.  On top of the sandwiches, of which there is a small but exciting selection, there's usually one or two intriguing (and always incredible) soups of the day, and a selection of cookies, pies, tarts, and quiches which mean that even at the thoroughly reasonable prices, I end up racking up quite a bill - but it's money I am glad to pay to fill my fridge with such delightful goodies.  The thing that prompted this extremely belated praise of Baguette Cafe was an article in Las Vegas Weekly about \"50 Must Eat Meals in Las Vegas\". As far as I'm concerned - no trip to Vegas is complete without one of Olivier's baguette creations, perhaps complimented with a generous slice of chocolate tart and washed down with artisan ginger ale. Las Vegas Weekly can keep their steaks from the Riveria and Chicken Fingers from the Crown & Anchor -- When I'm back home in Vegas I know where I'm heading.",

The staff is always having a great time amongst themselves as well as with the customers it is a nice way to brighten your day and make you feel happy. I have always loved Illy coffee and this cafe certainly does not disappoint.  Perfectly brewed I could go my whole day on a caffeine high from this location.  Close to the new IKEA that is being built it would be a great place to stop by before you have a long day of shopping.",

I'd say the service is a bit slow - it took 15 min. to order and only one person in front of us. And they need to do a better job bussing the tables and cleaning up. Maybe short staffed?

I arrived early for a meeting and ordered an omelet sandwich with a large hot tea, salad and juice all for just 5 dollars.  I was taken aback by their prices, the food tastes like it belongs in a much more expensive environment.  I could go on about the quality of the cuisine, but the service is what really got me hooked.  A woman named Shelby asked me my name and continually asked me how I liked everything throughout my meal, she even wanted to see how I would react to my first bite.  THAT'S how much they care about their customers as well as their food.   Pretty soon everyone else behind the counter was asking me how the food was.  It wasn't annoying at all as they all were addressing me by my first name.  I went all giddy over how personable they were being.  I even overheard the server refer to me as \"the gentleman over at this table\".  I felt like an automatic regular and a fine dining connoisseur all at once, and this was just my first visit!

I was so excited I started reading the menu on the plane so I knew I was going to try  the raisin pastry (sorry don't know the French name for it). It was perfectly crispy flaky on the outside with just a touch of custard running through curves. So good that I want one right now. We also tried the plain croissant and apricot croissant. I would definitely order the plain croissant. But I would pass on the apricot - it wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as the the other two. We ordered the quiche with pancetta. The flavor and the crust were amazing the only thing that held me back from a 5 star was the texture. It was so creamy (do they use cream cheese?)that at first I thought it was undercooked. It was still good - just was a little odd - but change is good right? The owners are from France and are the nicest! I'm so glad we don't have one of these in my neighborhood - because I wouldn't be able to resist dropping in every day!",

For a typical cafe I spend no more than 8 dollars or I feel like I've been cheated of my money...  I spend an average of 12 to 13 bucks at Baguette Cafe and have never regretted it once for the following reasons:  Service: Everyone is attentive and friendly even when the place gets packed. Feel free to ask for daily specials or soup of the day!   Food: Light but portions are large enough to fill you up. Everything is downright delectable and just so refreshing to eat.  Atmosphere: Coupled with the delicious food, a comfortable dining area full of natural light also makes eating here more pleasant. There is ample outdoor seating as well for nice days.   They bring their food to you! My favorites are the ham and brie sandwich and corn chowder. Their house salad dressing is delicious. Get the fresh juice!  Baguette Cafe may be a bit of a drive and a few dollars above my usual price point, but it's always worth it.",

Also felt like I had to knock off a star because we ordered a green juice('be change'), which sounded like a great combination... but we couldn't finish it. We're usually huge fans of green drinks, so maybe there's a sweetener something, it just felt off. Maybe it was just our drink though.",

It is certainly a different mix of ingredients than a standard sub or sandwich. We got an egg and bacon croissant which had a red tomato base to it. I was hoping for fresh eggs but it was kind of omelette style. I got the chicken apple blue cheese baguette and while the concept was great, the blue cheese was extremely overpowering. I got a tuna sandwich and they literally throw a huge tomato slice and half an egg on each half of the sandwich. I'm sure there are plenty of people that love it, but was not for me.",

    "text": "I stopped at Baguette Cafe two years ago on a Saturday to find out they were closed on weekends.  With much of their business coming from the office buildings where, they're located, that's probably a goof idea because even though it's along the freeway, it's off the beaten path.  There was no line and I ordered a Moroccan sandwich with chicken, one of their grilled sandwich options.  This sandwich can also be made with eggplant for a vegetarian option.  With it, I ordered an iced black tea.  I sat at a high top table on the side so I could watch the people do their work at the grill and espresso machine.  In a short time, my sandwich and tea were on my table.  The sandwich came with some mixed greens with a little dressing.  The Moroccan is made with goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and is topped with a North African spiced aioli.  The sandwich was quite good and the mixed greens were a perfect amount for a lunch portion with sandwich.  I really liked the North African spiced aioli.  It gave the sandwich a very good flavor.  The cafe has a nice area for outdoor eating between the two buildings or in front where it's shaded.  It looked very pleasant but the morning was still cool m so I stayed indoors.  I would have tried a pastry but there wasn't much of a selection left.  It looked like the pastry people had come through and bought everything in sight.  I do like this place but it really is inconvenient to get to from where I live.  It's a good option if you're in the area.  If you're coming west on the 215, I'd exit at Buffalo and take the frontage road from there to the business park. Going to Durango would involve some backtracking.",

I would give this restaurant a 3 normally for the nice patio setting and the food being okay, but their customer service just angered me.   We ordered a special juice they had made thinking it would be delicious. It was Watermelon lemonade. Unfortunately when we sat down we tried it and it did not taste very good at all, so we politely asked if we could exchange it for anything, even something much cheaper. They said no.   We started eating our sandwiches and still did not get our soup till 7 minutes later and our latte 12 minutes later.   We also noticed there was no chicken in the chicken sandwich. We went in and when they saw us they asked \"WHATS WRONG NOW?\" We asked if the chicken sandwich had chicken in it and they took it and brought back the same sandwich with a few bites out of it just now with some chicken.    When they finally brought out our latte they also brought out two pastries and apologized, but unfortunately the damage was done.   Presentation is lackluster. One redeeming quality is their carrot soup that we had the first time and their vanilla latte.   Unfortunately I'm not sure we will be back.",

    "text": "Look up \"pastries\" or \"croissants\" on Yelp and you'll be directed to Baguette Cafe. And looking at all the positive feedback from the public, you'll feel a sense of bewilderment as to why you haven't made the drive out to try it yourself. At least that's what drove me to give Baguette Cafe a try.   Seeing all the reviews about the chocolate croissants - and me not even being a big fan of chocolate - I knew I had to give it a try myself. From all the reviews, I gathered that Baguette is a family run business opened by French chef Olivier and his parents. They are there at the front of the house, greeting customers with a smile as they work hard to get out the orders as quickly as possible.   Location of Baguette Cafe is in a strange area behind the many industrial buildings. You'll have to navigate through the parking lots to reach the cafe. I get a sense that this cafe is incredibly busy on weekdays when work is in session and people are lining up for coffee and breakfast. Luckily I came on a Saturday morning where there was no problem with parking - took my treats to-go and ended up studying while munching in Ikea.   They offer food items such as salads, sandwiches, paninis and they also have a brunch menu (fruit, sandwiches, quiches, etc.). And of course - the delicious sweets that are baked in-house. From cookies to croissants to fruit tarts - you'll be able to satisfy that sweet tooth once you're here! And don't forget the coffee and espressos that they whip up.   So I had to try their popular chocolate twist ($3.30). It was tough choosing between the twist and pain au chocolate, but the twist looked crispier and seemed like it had more chocolate woven throughout. After having it reheated, I took a bite and definitely got that crispy, flaky texture of the twist along with the smooth, melted chocolate that was embedded into the twist. Even though I don't normally crave chocolate, I really thought that was a good pastry.   I think I tried a raisin and pudding roll as well (also $3.30). I preferred the roll over the twist, just because I really liked the sweetness of the pudding as well as the sweetness of the raisins. The roll was not as flaky as the twist, but still had a crispy texture - I liked that it wasn't too sweet, thus complementing the pudding and raisins.   They had a bunch of other sweets that I really wanted to try, but I felt like $3.30 was already quite high for a pastry. The sandwiches smelled good as well, but I was craving something sweet that morning.   tl;dr - Highly recommend dropping by the Baguette Cafe if you are in the area and want something sweet (or savory!). Loved both of the pastries that I tried, but because they have such an assortment and everything is tasty and fresh, I think everybody can find something that they'll enjoy. A good number of seats inside and outside the cafe, but it can get busy!",

Although the inside can only seat about 20-30 people, there's an abundance of outdoor seating for when the temperatures hover around 70-80 degrees.   The food is spectacular! Everything tastes wholesome, authentic, and delicious! I decided on the classic Ham and Swiss Croissant, and it's one of the best I've ever had! The ham and swiss were flavorful, and the croissant was flaky and light; served with a side salad, the meal was a perfect size for breakfast or lunch.   I also sampled the quiche with bacon and onion, as well as the egg panini with tomato basil sauce, and both were just as good as the croissant! Not to mention the prices are INSANELY good for the quality! Some of these dishes ranging from $5-$7!   Lastly, everyone who worked at Baguette Cafe was an absolute pleasure to interact with. Everyone was super accommodating and full of positive energy.   Needless to say, I'll definitely be back. Good food, amazing quality, pleasant environment, and a wonderful staff; Baguette Cafe does everything right!",

In Baguette Cafe, Olivier created the town's best french cafe.  The hot sandwiches and soups make for one of the best lunches around.  I've enjoyed the pesto, the eggplant, the moroccan, the curry, and the chipotle sandwiches.  I cannot pick a favorite because they are all exquisite!    To top if off, Olivier is always smiling and takes the time to greet every guest.  The restaurant is small, but, for a cafe, provides plenty of seating, inside and outside.  Sandwiches are reasonably priced around $8.  Hot sandwiches usually take about fifteen minutes to prepare.  So, order ahead if you are in a rush.  Great things like this take time!      ALL-STAR DISHES: all of the sandwiches.",

I have yet to try an item on the menu that I dislike, and the presentation is always above your regular restaurant standards. It's family owned and operated and the owners are always interacting with customers which is a great difference with other \"family owned\" restaurants and such here in Sun City.  Highly recommend giving it a go if you have the chance!",

With the great service we received all around, the food is delightful! It's a smaller quaint dining establishment with patio seating as well. We luckily were able to place our order before the lunch rush.  I think there was a line the entire time we were there.  The secret is out or I am just late to the party.  Since I was eating lunch with a friend who shares everything with me, I was able to taste an abundance of menu options.  What shocked me the most was the Tuna Sandwich.  I'm usually not one to order this but I'm so glad we did.  It was light, fresh and not overly fishy.  It was topped with tomato, egg and fresh greens.  I adore this sandwich.  The Pesto Chicken Panini was no slouch either.  The sandwich included the toppings of avocado, mozzarella and bacon.  You can't go wrong with those ingredients.  Delicious!  Each sandwich had a small green salad on the side.    Now I'm not going to leave out the scrumptious desserts we indulged.  Tiramisu is always a favorite of mine.  Yes. It's wonderful.  The Chocolate Croissant was really fresh.  It contained the perfect amount of chocolate so it didn't take away from the croissant itself.    I certainly enjoyed my first visit here and I can't wait for the second.  Thank you Baguette Cafe for a lovely lunch!",

Everything has a very European flair. The baguettes are fresh, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Not overstuffed with anything and a nice balance of meat cheese and accompaniments.   The coffee is perfect.  Hot and delicious.   The vinaigrette on the salad is light with a nice tang. It's well balanced. I often get extra dressing to use on my sandwich.   The desserts are scrumptious. One year my wife had them bake my favorite cake for my birthday.   The quiche. Oh the quiche is delicious too. They have three different kinds. I've always gotten the vegetarian one and it's light fluffy and filling.",

    "text": "I joined my foodie partner in crime here for lunch recently and loved everything we tried. The service was also friendly.   The location is easy to access from the 215. Parking is easy since it's in a corporate parkway with plenty of parking. The inside of the restaurant is simple with about half a dozen tables. Most of the seating is outside. It didn't seem like seating was an issue since most people were getting their orders to go.   The menu offers a nice variety of options. They serve breakfast as well as lunch. For lunch the paninis can be vegetarian with options for mushrooms or eggplant in place of meat. For meat eaters there are a couple of meat options. Even though I'm not vegetarian the option for mushroom or eggplant in place of meat sounded delicious.  Sharing is caring so like usual we shared everything we ordered for lunch. The Tuna Sandwich was the memorable savory item we enjoyed. The tuna was delicious and lacked any sort of fishy taste. Mixed in was olives and the sandwich was topped with egg and some other vegetables. The sandwich flavors reminded me of a Nicoise salad. I loved this and would definitely order it again. The Pesto Panini which we ordered with chicken and bacon was also good. The bread and other ingredients worked well together. I liked dressed on the simple greens to the side of each sandwich too.  For a sweet ending to our lunch we enjoyed Tiramisu and a Chocolate Croissant. Both were excellent. The Tiramisu had the perfect texture and taste. The first bite made me stop and close my eyes to savor the delicious flavor. The Chocolate Croissant was flaky and the chocolate was delicious.   I will definitely be back, hopefully next time to try some of their breakfast menu!",

My fiance saw this place and wanted to try it, but we found it out was closed on the weekends. =( My craving for a tasty sandwich/panini lead me to this place finally! I left work early so that I could beat the lunch rush and I definitely beat it.   I decided to get the Chicken Sandwich (chicken, mixed greens, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese and pesto) on a panini minus the bacon. The sandwich itself is pretty large which was surprising, because in the pictures it looked smaller. The sandwich was very flavorful and chicken was white meat (my favorite) and tender! All the ingredients paired up perfectly.   My addiction to chocolate croissants also had me running to this place. Yes, I ordered the pain au chocolat....two of them actually. Although this is not on my diet plan, I had to get them. The crust is very flaky but buttery at the same time. It was pretty dang delicious!   I took all of this to go and my panini was still warm by the time I got back to work. There were a couple of salads that caught my eye so I definitely will be back for more deliciousness!",

    "text": "Friday morning and wanted more than the usual Starbucks run, I finally found this hidden gem tucked in the back of a large business complex when you enter off Sunset. Baguette is a quaint breakfast/lunch spot that caters not just to the surrounding office community but to savvy locals who want good food and a great ambiance. Olivier is welcoming and greets every guest like an old friend. The pastry chef moves about the kitchen bringing out scrumptious treats like tarts, muffins and the fresh baked croissants. These croissants will completely spoil you forever. It would have been a sin not to have one. The warm buttery aroma wafts through the air like a warm blanket for your olfactory senses. Close your eyes, sit at a table bathed in morning sunlight, drink a fresh mango orange juice, then take a bite of heaven. The Croissant & egg omelette was incredible. The omelette is prepared to outstanding culinary standards, the croissant is light, flaky with a thin layer of buttery soft dough that almost melts in your mouth as you take a bite, there is a light tomato basil sauce that elevates it above all other breakfast croissants and it is served with a small house salad so you can have a serving of greens. I am elated to have finally experienced Baguette Cafe and will make this a regular morning ritual at least once a week. \"Bon Appetite!\"",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to trying this place because of all of their amazing reviews especially the ones posted by the elite members. However, by all means avoid the lunch hour rush! I came in a few minutes before noon and luckily there was only 1 person ahead of me. But a minute after, practically every office employee within a 1 mile radius was here! Not only physically, but also calling in their orders for them to pick up (smart decision).  As I was waiting in line and looking over the menu. I noticed Olivier was holding his phone with his gloves on. And from what I saw he touched some food immediately after.   The first thing I put in my mouth was greens from the side salad that came with the sandwich. Unfortunately the greens were wilted, which was already a turn off.    I ordered the tuna panini which was a pretty standard panini. The only thing is it wasn't left on the panini press long enough because the lines from the grill were really faint. I think since they were in a rush to get the food in and out of the kitchin quick, it wasn't left on the press long enough. And I really do like that toasty taste.   I was more pleased with my other selections such as the shrimp bisque and the banana nut muffin.  Shrimp Bisque- very tasty, I've ordered lobster bisque at a classy restaurant and this was just as good. The 2 pieces of toasted baguette was a really nice touch.  Banana nut muffin- really moist and I enjoy the fact there's no cinammon.   I will probably be back, just to see if my next experience with be more enjoyable.",

I usually go for their chipotle panini which was recommended to me by the gentleman working and it's dynamite, but everything I have had is delicious! I love the simple side salad, it's always fresh.  The location is a little hard to find the first few times, but the owner has put up signs that lead you in the right direction.",

    "text": "Baguette Cafe is one of my new go-to lunch spots. Every time I walk in the owner, Olivier, pleasantly welcomes me to his shop. He is always in a good mood that really lightens up the atmosphere even if it is busy inside at lunch time.   There are a variety of salads, breakfasts, soups, fresh pastries, and sandwiches offered. On a first try, you must have a soup and a sandwich.   The soups change daily and are always delicious. Consider yourself lucky if you come on a day when the spinach or butternut squash veloute is offered; they are some of the best soups I have ever had.  There are a variety of cold and hot-pressed sandwiches, but hot-pressed is the way to go. The bread is exquisitely toasted and extremely fresh. All the sandwiches are offered with a choice of meat or vegetarian and there are also tasty vegan options.   Coupled with the fresh food, the pastries are absolutely amazing. I've tried the chocolate twists and the mixed berry tart; they both nearly made me drool all over the table.   If you are in a rush, make sure to call your order in ahead of time. Olivier recently told me they are implementing an online order system which should make things even easier.  I have tried nearly every sandwich and a soup every time I come in, and have yet to be disappointed. If only they were open 24/7. Baguette Cafe really is a gem.",

I had a very tasty panini sandwich with chicken, cheese, sun dried tomato spread, bacon, a large bowl of DELICIOUS vegetable soup, a large strawberry smoothie and a LARGE piece of homemade chocolate tart (delicious also) for about $20 with tax and tip.  Good price for a good amount of good food.  Nice little place with a homey little atmosphere.

    "text": "I went twice this week (once for breakfast, once for lunch) just to confirm what I thought after my first visit. There are few words to really grasp how great this place is. Sublime. It is sublime. Baguette Cafe is the definition of 5 stars. It is the pinnacle of what such a place should be. I went in hoping for a decent cup of coffee and my expectations were happily surpassed.   For breakfast, I had the traditional quiche lorraine and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was superb. To add sugar or anything else to it would be a crime. The quiche was a fantastic balance of flavor with a crisp, light crust on the bottom. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich, tea, and juice. His only issue was wishing the size of his tea was switched with the size of his juice. The tea was tropical green tea and it was very tasty as well.  For lunch, I had the Jerusalem artichoke soup, a blueberry muffin, and another cappuccino. My feelings on the cappuccino are clear. The soup was up to par with the rest of the food I had experienced. The soup was satiny and fresh. A spoonful delicately coated my mouth with a creamy deliciousness. The muffin was tender and sweet while not crumbly or overpowering. There was no shortage of blueberries either which is often a problem I experience with muffins. The cup of soup, muffin, and drink proved to be quite a satisfying lunch.  I haven't even gotten to Olivier. He's the proprietor of the establishment and greets every customer with a warm, sincerity that I wish was seen at every business. During breakfast, he knew the name and order of every customer who came in. He was attentive without being intrusive and it's clear he takes great pride in every detail of his business.  At lunch, every single person sitting around me and those who walked in said it was one of, if not THE most fantastic place they had ever eaten. One gentleman said it was the best food in Vegas and I might be inclined to agree. You won't run across this place on the street though. It's at the back of a business complex, but it is worth the trip from wherever you live. The only bummer, they are only open 7-5, M-F. I did overhear Olivier saying they might try a Saturday if they get a solid enough business outside the employees of the surrounding buildings.  This is not a fast food place even though you get your food pretty fast. It's as though it exists outside regular time. When I eat there, I savor every bite and it reminds me to take time out for myself to appreciate the world around me. Seriously, this place is amazing. GO. NOW.",

    "text": "Awesome sandwich! five-star service! As soon as I knew that I was coming to Vegas for a short vacation, I found out about this sandwich place. Although it has a Frenchie name, I was expecting this restaurant to be an \"american sandwich\" place. It surprised me with the lovely food and service there. I customized my croissant with curry chicken . The croissant was amazing, I would say the best I've ever had. However, my only complaint is the location. This is in the middle of nowhere and if you're not living in Vegas and you're not driving, it's about $40 cab from the strip to the cafe. So I spent approximately $80 just to come here and go back. The owner Olivier(with the french accent!) was super nice and he gave me a cookie for coming over that far just for his food.",

    "text": "C'este si bon! Yes, it really is SO good! Incredibly flavorful and delicate enough to satisfy without feeling overly stuffed. Fresh, natural and quality ingredients! Service with a smile and just overall, tres magnifique!  Olivier was there and has a gift of excellent customer service! Charming and charismatic are the best ways to describe the people who work here! I have to say that with 100% honesty this place is the best french food that money can buy in this town!   The last time I remember eating food this fresh, I was sitting on the steps of a17th century church, eating a picnic of local meats, cheve and ripe tomatoes we bought off the streets in the market of Apt, France.  The only thing missing was the sweet provencal sun and a bottle of wine!   I highly recommend a half sandwich and soup/salad combo! Its perfect portions and sensible value will allow you to indulge on a heavenly patisserie and espresso to boot! Please give the specials a try, you won't find them on the menu so remember to ask.    I am in LOVE with the tomato, cucumber and basil gazpacho! I could eat a gallon of it but then I wouldn't have room for the goat cheese and moroccan chicken sandwich on a crisp baguette! Yum! Last but certainly not least, is my most treasured Pan Aux Raisin! I search high and low for this coveted patisserie that is not only rare to find in its authenticity but in its simple and uncomplicated form.  Guess what? It's here at the Baguette Cafe and it's as good as I remember eating from the Patisseries on the streets of Paris.   My only complaint, is that I live 23 min away (I actually timed it)! Also if you are on W. Sunset looking for the Cafe you have to find the cluster of office buildings and cut through those parking lots, go in the direction of 215 to find it.  Just watch your gps and you'll see.    Merci, Monsieur Olivier!  I will be back for sure!",

When I'm watching my carb intake (cough), I'm a huge fan of the Prosciutto Salad. All of the pastries are baked in-house each morning by the owners, and I simply cannot resist a banana or strawberry muffin if they're available.   The quiche Lorraine is my favorite of the quiches, but Olivier usually switches up the type of quiche prepared every few days; keeps things interesting, you know? The cherry on top of this entire deal is the fact that only Illy coffee and espresso is served. The owner, Olivier, and his entire staff and family are the sweetest, most personable people on the planet.   Even if the food wasn't orgasmic, I'd come back just for the service.",

Not their fault. Baguette Cafe is the best place to eat a sandwich in Las Vegas. The Bleu Brie is just silly. I love eating cambozola on a sandwich. I love that you can tell the chicken has been carefully herb roasted. I love that the bread is both crusty and soft. I love that they add things like chopped walnuts and celery to melt in with the cheese. I love that you are served a cute little salad to eat after your sandwich.  The coffee is good and prepared well. The employees are very personable, helpful, and proud of the food they prepare. They will call you by name. There is nothing I love more than high-quality food and excellent customer service. Come here and bring those you wish to impress.",

It's very clean and neat and your instantly greeted with a warm good morning. Take note: I'm not a big morning person so I'm pretty crabby early in the day so it really brightens up my mood lol  the cashier immediately recognized I was a new comer and gave me a lil tour. Everything from the quiche to the freshly baked croissant looked amazing.. He was making my mouth water while going over everything. I decided to get the hot mocha rocha and the prosciutto salad since I was craving a salad.. Both were delicious! Will definitely be coming back hopefully not to go this time lol",

I'm not going to go on about the food, because everyone has pretty much summed it up.  But one thing that I am surprised that no one has mentioned are the prices.  I had been complaining a lot lately that I couldn't get a decent sandwich without spending over 10 bucks.  This place is different, you can get one for around 6 bucks, which is great.  And if you're afraid like me that you won't get full, get a decent sized salad or soup for another 3ish bucks.    But this is a perfect lunch spot on a work day.  The food is legiznit (did I just say that??)  The portions aren't huge where you're going to be in a food coma, and you're not going to spend your life savings.  What a deal huh?",

(I've been to France twice and had eaten around)  I found this little french cafe from yelp and it was worth driving!!! We got fresh squeezed orange juice, croissant, pain de chocolate, raisin danish, and 1 cappuccino and ice coffee. Olivier, who took our order shake ice coffee with milk n sugar as if it was a cocktail. WOW!! He served the drinks with attention and it was almost artistic. All of the drinks and food were AMAZING. My mom was really happy to see the little straw art. Olivier is french and I enjoyed a little french conversation with him. He was really really sweet.  I had an amazing breakfast there. I am sooooo going back next time I go to Vegas. Please open one in LA?lol  Merci beaucoup.",

Lesson learned from a previous visit, we called ahead to check on the availability of chocolate croissants.  We were informed they would be ready in 30 minutes - somewhere between 9 - 9:30.  We arrived and were greeted very pleasantly by Olivier and his mother Claudine.  They introduced themselves, asked our names, asked if we had visited before and so on.  It was a very polite and personable experience.    After ordering, Olivier suggested we dine al fresco under the olive tree.  So, we did just that.  We set up shop in the shade, put our feet up, and read.  Approximately 20 minutes later we received our quiche, chocolate croissant, cappucino, and frappe.  Everything was delightlful.  The croissant was just as we had hoped...buttery, airy, flaky and scrumptious.  The quiche was piping hot, and perfectly seasoned; it came with fresh vibrant spinach with a drizzle of yummy balsamic vinaigrette.  Food is served with china and silverware and drinks in real ceramic cups.  Thats always nice.  Can't wait to go again.  An absolutely divine morning for $20.  Oui! Merci!",

After reading about 10 or 15 raving reviews I decided I must venture across the street to find this hidden gem...and let me tell you, if you don't live on this side of town, it is TOTALLY worth the trip...  Olivier greeted me as he does every single person who walks through the door, asking my name & making me feel as though I had been there a million times before...and today was only my first time...I told him I heard about his place on yelp and he said \"we love that website, they have been so good to us\"...he explained the menu to me and recommended that I return some time to have lunch (I most definitely will be returning)   I had the Spinach/Swiss Omelet with Bacon & sun-dried tomato walnut pesto (of course with bacon because doesn't that make EVERYTHING just that much tastier??) on a croissant...it came with orange juice & my choice of tea, hot chocolate or coffee...since I'm not a coffee drinker (WHAT? I can hear the gasps now, but sadly yes, I've never acquired the taste for that wonderfully smelling bitterness that seems to keep my colleagues running) but just as an FYI - if you haven't read any other reviews - they serve ILLY coffee which apparently is pretty damn good coffee - but I digress - the croissant was so deliciously buttery and flaky & the omelet inside was absolutely perfect...after that amazing little breakfast sandwich I got up and looked at the freshly made tarts that were in the cabinet & he told me that he also had a lemon tart that he was getting ready to cut...and I couldn't help myself but take a slice of that also...let me tell you...if you like the sour of REAL lemon with just a dash of sweetness, this is heaven...and I'm not joking...the crust was flaky...the fresh creme that was put to the side, dusted with cocoa...blew my mind...my tastebuds were singing his praises...  There were 4 other people there when I first arrived but within 20 minutes there was a line out the door...to say this place is popular is an understatement...I only wish they were open later (7a-5p, M-F) and that they were open on the weekends...",

I bought a chocolate crossant and a peach tart for a small treat to share with the family. Big mistake...I really didn't want to share after I tasted the tart ;-) next time I will just buy everyone their own cause sharing really isn't even a option...it's plenty big enough to share but you really don't want too. Their coffee is yummers too! They have my favorite brand illy coffee :-)   Another plus for this place is the owner/server, Olivier :-) If I wasn't a married mama I would probably be his biggest groupie. He takes the time to ask your name and he actually uses it! Not just by calling out my name when the order is ready but actually talking to me. I felt like I was a regular to his cafe yet this was my first visit....I love that feeling! He was telling me how just about everything was made from scratch in his tiny cafe.

    "text": "When you couple great service with wholesome, nourishing food, you seem to find yourself at the Baguette Cafe...at least, that was the case when I visited. I had always been meaning to try the Baguette Cafe for months, but finally made it up here after running random errands around the city. The hype, unlike most places, is well-deserved.  Right when I walked in, the place was full to capacity - tables occupied inside and out, a line forming all the way to the door. Luckily, this allowed me to sort out my indecisions, and decided upon a tea and the Eggplant panini. Not only are the other fellow patrons incredibly nice (as found out through enduring a line together), but Olivier is perhaps one of the sweetest, most charming men. Joking around, offering suggestions, and making small talk even when there are five people behind me, he makes you feel right at home, and treats you as a patron rather than another order.   Sitting outside, I was brought my tea by Oliver and panini accompanied by a small salad later on by another staff member. The panini was so simple, yet so immensely satisfying. Eggplant, mozzarella, and marinara sauce on bread - even though I could count the ingredients on one hand, it tasted phenomenal. You could taste the love that went into such a simple sandwich The salad was a nice sidekick, playing the role of added nutrition to all the carbs I was about to ingest.   After my meal, Olivier really showed his gregariousness. Wrapping up my leftovers, he asked how the meal went and other various questions. But what impressed me the most was adding in another packet of the green tea I had ordered as well as being so friendly and relaxed despite being in the midst of a rush.   Honestly, Baguette Cafe is the sort of place I could sit at for hours, staring at the nearby mountain range - throw in some more delicious food and a cup of tea, and I'd be perfectly content. The savory side of the menu was impressive, and only leaves me with an excuse to visit again to try all of the sweeter goods.",

Mmmmmmm the croissant smells perfumes the restaurant.   Simple fresh flavored food is my four word summary but the few words don't provide the place due justice.  The subtle simplicity of well made breads combined with fresh ingredients really satisfied my palette. The baguettes have a nice crust and inner layers have a wonderful chew.  Coffee selection can satisfy the sweet flavored coffee drinkers. The mochas are sweet but not too sugary, flavors (as described) come through with a faint coffee note at the end.  Overall a really solid place for breakfast and a light lunch.",

Cons:  - Customer Service...they are just too busy especially during lunch hours to clean the tables fast enough...not necessarily a bad thing.  - Customer Service...they are just too busy especially during lunch hours so there can be a long line...not necessarily a bad thing...nom nom food takes time.  - More shade for outdoor area...probably a complex matter though.

I appreciate all of their selections because they're not too heavy, and you're not filled with a lot regret afterwards.   Quiches were a decent breakfast as well. Eggs were fluffy and soft, but the crust was not as flaky and buttery as I had hoped.   However, I do recommend the chocolate tart 10/10. I asked the owner, \"these tarts.. are good for breakfast?\" Usually I'm not open to eating dessert to start my day haha, but it was great and tart-mazing!

It is small so they can't seat many people inside so go early before the rush or you might end up taking it to go.  It's a fresh, unique cafe with a variety of sandwhichea, large portioned salads and thirst quenching coffees, juices and teas.   It does seem like a spot that is utilized mostly by the employees within the business complex, huge business complex so I am sure they get plenty busy. I'll admit that's why I stopped in, it's next to my building and I needed a quick bite. Sure happy I did stop in though, I'll be going back!  The service was great as well. We were welcomed right as we walked in, the girl who took our order was incredibly friendly , the guy who dropped our food off came back to check on us and as we left everyone said thank you and good bye!

The staff is really nice and very helpful. I will be back if I am over there and remember it exists!",

My husband really enjoys coming here and speaking his native language.    We've enjoyed everything so far.  Fresh ham & cheese sandwich, quiches, croissants, panties, and lattes.  There is usually a line going on.  I would suggest to come a little bit earlier before lunch or late lunch.  There is a bit of a wait.  So worth it if you're not in a rush.",

    "text": "Baguette cafe has been on my must-list for a while now due to all the rave reviews on yelp and my friend's recommendations. Olivier was super friendly, introducing himself and asking for our names. The girl at the cashier was also lovely. I get the appeal here...they have amazing service and treat their customers like family. And for that, I'd probably give them my business over other places. After all, Vegas is a service industry, and that's the gold standard,   I had the prosciutto and the chipotle chicken sandwich, and I liked the latter much more. I was thinking that the prosciutto would have a lot of flavor, as it's supposed to have blue cheese and some walnuts, but I wasn't able to really taste any of the other stuff due to the prosciutto being overpowering. The baguette bread they use is okay (not light brown on the outside like I expected from a traditional French baguette, but white) and you can't walk in expecting a 12 inch sub. Their sandwiches are about 6-inches with a mini salad on the side. The quiche (with bacon) was okay. Croissant was good.   I'll come back and try the eggplant sandwiches and soup next time, which seems to be their most popular items.",

I was originally just have a croissant and espresso, but it soon turned into a buttery croissant filled with scrumptious fluffy scramble eggs, Swiss cheese, Black Forest Ham, and with garlic infused mild tomato spread served with a side salad for around $7.   The croissant was absolutely heavenly with its flaky exterior and buttery moist center. It came with a filling amount of ham, and the eggs were very well prepared with a soft  fluffiness and spot on seasoning. The Swiss cheese was nicely melted and the tomato spread was just right. Its flavor let you know it was there, but did not overwhelm the croissant breakfast sandwich. A great way to start the day indeed.  The side salad was fresh, crisp, and light dressed with a tasty balsamic creamy dressing. The espresso was very smooth but with a rich robust after taste. Best of all, my meal with the coffee was all for under $10. Also service was outstanding and very friendly.   When in Vegas, I will be stopping in again.",

How can a cafe service not get such a simple order right on their slow time? After 20 minutes I finished my coffee and had to go back in to ask for my croissant to go.

I'm so glad we did though because this cafe was great.  It was a little hard to find the cafe though because it was nestled in between some buildings, but we managed to find it and went inside. The owner of the cafe greeted us warmly and asked if any of us had ever been there before. We said no and he immediately went over the food and drinks on the menu. I ordered The Pesto off the Grilled Sandwiches menu, which had sun dried tomato walnut pesto, avocado, mozzarella, and I went with the choice of chicken and bacon on it instead of eggplant. I also got a cup of water when I paid, and took my stand with my number on it to some tables.  I'm glad we went when we did because after we had ordered, the busy lunch rush hit. Yet even with that lunch rush, our food came out pretty quickly.  The food. The food! I nearly inhaled my pesto grilled sandwich, it was so good from the first bite to the end. I thought about ordering another one for the road, but stopped myself because I had a long day of eating ahead of me. My friends ordered other sandwiches, as well as coffee drinks, and they were impressed with their orders.  It was only by lucky happenstance that we found this place, but I'm so glad we did. I definitely need to come back and try out more of the sandwiches on the menu.",

I wanted to try something new for the sandwiches and I had the Moroccan and it was surprisingly and unbelievably very delicious. No exaggeration at all. My husband always like tuna sandwich and also that was an upgrade in taste and with hard boiled eggs in it. All their breads are baked daily. I love chocolate croissant and theirs was soft, flakey, and chocolatey. The fresh baked is very apparent. I also love bread pudding so I wanted to try theirs and it was divine with the raspberry sauce and whipped cream. There are more outside sitting than inside but since it's summer it wasn't a big deal. Overall a great experience and will recommend and will come back!",

There were 5 of us and not one of us had an issue with our orders. I had the pick 2: prosciutto salad and the blue Brie sandwich. It was delicious! Other items ordered were the tuna salad sandwich, prosciutto quiche and a turkey sandwich. All a must try! If you haven't been here before and need ideas, you can't go wrong with any of those.

It has the potential to be five stars, just tiny adjustments need to be made.   Walking in we went to order and I let them know it was our first time there. No recommendations were made, no explanation as to if we wait for the food or it's delivered. We went with the Vanilla Latte and to share the Quiche. The gentlemen said our number was 27. I didn't know if that meant I wait til they call it... however I looked around and saw everyone had numbers. At the end of the counter I saw lots of numbers and then mine... 27.  Liked the layout, as there are lots of outside seating and a good amount indoors including a nice size black couch. The service was okay. I didn't like that my drink and quiche came out before his plain black coffee. They apologized. Tables were clean. Coffee was strong, tasty, could have been a tad warmer. The quiche was fantastic! Full of flavor. Probably one of the best quiches I've had. Loved that it was paired with a tiny green mix salad. Nice touch.   Will try this a second time around to see if it improve.",

What we didnt know was that a large group of people who came straight of the patagonia catalogue was going to order everything on the menu. Yeah, it was a lot of people and the guy ringing everyone up was super friendly, but it caused the line to move very slowly creating a build up of people in the corner.   Once we finally ordered, my friend got a croissant and almond milk mocha which she seemed to enjoy. I had a cold brew and bread pudding cake. I cant really speak to what she had, but she did say she enjoyed it. My cold Brew was good and strong, but nothing too spectacular. The bread pudding was definitely better warm, and big enough to save for later. It would have probably been a better experience if the line moved faster, but I would give them a 4 based on my first visit.",

    "text": "Two Words: Olivier's Cafe  *YELP's TOP 100 Places to Eat in 2018 - #34*  Baguette Cafe has a special place in my heart. This place is actually one of the first places I've dined when I first moved to Vegas in 2015. Since then, I've been here at least 30 times. My experience has always been pleasant, especially with Olivier and his sweet mother greeting you with their bright smiles.   I love all of their four quiche(s) and buttery croissants - top notch quality and quite a generous portion. You can't get that in any of the other French cafes in Vegas. Trust me, I've tried ;)  They just got a new espresso machine, \"The Black Eagle,\" which has elevated their coffee drinks to a whole 'notha level. I ordered a vanilla latte and it was deeply-rich with a velvety touch.  I also enjoy going here for lunch to get a warm panini or one of their hearty, freshly made soups.  Stop by Baguette Cafe, you'll come back for more!",

It's sooo good, and vegetarian which is great because I've been trying to cut out meat when possible.  Just get it!  Also their coffee sizes are 16oz and 20oz and are in the $5 range so you get what you pay for.  Btw this place is NOT dirty like another reviewer stated. It's far from it.",

I went back, and it was pretty much the same, which is good. I had the prosciutto. My boyfriend had the turkey. My sister had the pesto. He had the mango smoothie, I had the mocha with almond, and we each had a bite of a chocolate croissant. The croissant was pretty good, but I don't think I've ever had a bad one. The sandwiches were crunchy and yummy, but the fillings can be a bit sparse. I had more lettuce than anything else by far. However, it was still pretty good. The pesto was also a bit less full, but I loveeee their pesto, so it is what it is.   While I was too scared to try it (I'm allergic to pineapples), my boyfriend said his mango smoothie was good and sweet. My mocha with almond (and almond milk) was really yummy as well, and the serving size was great. While this isn't my favorite sandwich place in town, it definitely will not let you down.",

I've never been disappointed with what I've ordered although I do tend to always get the same thing because it's SO good.  I usually get cold brew to start.  They have a variety of other custom drinks as well.  I usually get the Chipotle with the chicken and bacon.  It is SO GOOD!  The look of the sandwich doesn't do it justice because it kind of looks flat when you get it but your first bite will tell you otherwise.  The sandwich will come with a tiny side of lettuce with a dressing on it which is a nice touch.  They have desserts that are all made daily!  I believe it was the bread pudding that was amazing.  I love that they have indoor and outdoor seating and they bring your drinks and food out to you as they are made.    Such a cute lunch or breakfast place that's a must try!  If you're using your GPS be patient, it's kind of tucked in a corporate building area so it can take a minute to find them!",

Boy am I glad, read on.....  Customer Service: 5/5 Two words, WORLD CLASS. You seriously don't get services like this too often. The gentleman who took our orders, whom I believe to be the owner was OUTSTANDING. I believe he said his name was Oliver.    He was patience, accommodating and super knowledgeable.  I am super picky, since I don't see what I like on the menu, he actually made my sandwich the way I requested. I was like, get out of here, really? Furthermore, it came out perfect!  Honestly, we got better service here then a high end Steakhouse and that's no exaggeration.    Price: 5/5 Super inexpensive, we ordered a bunch of items and barely came out to $34. That's one dish and a drink at Cheesecake Factory.  Especially with services like this, pricing really doesn't even matter.   Quality: 5/5 My special baquette order and white blended mocha was exceptional and my friend ordered the spinach egg quiche, according to my friend, it was also superb.  In addition, we also had the raison baguette as dessert and that was fluffy yummy as well.  Quantity: 5/5 Every portion was definitely enough for a starving person, just perfect.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Although it was super busy, (not surprised for sure) it was nice and cozy. The temperature was also perfect.  Cleanliness: 5/5 The place was immaculate, considering how busy they were. I was also impressed by how clean the restroom was for being so busy.   Tips: The owner is most definitely amazing at running this place. Furthermore, they baked their croissants every hour. Yummy!!!!",

The prices are ridiculously low.  $4 for the breakfast sandwich?  Similar to what Mcdonalds charges.  I think the owners here could get away with a price hike without any backlash.

I took a deep breath and got in line, because I figured people are queuing, because it's good.  Indeed, it is.  At first I was going to order the Moroccan, but decided against it, as I think tomatoes are evil and instead ordered the curry sandwich with chicken.  As a treat for getting my butt kicked at Shine, I treated myself to their peanut butter chocolatechip cookie.  I took my goodies back with me to the hotel and the sandwich was still very warm!  The cookie was almost an inch thick!   The sandwich oh so de-lightfully delicious!  The cookie was wonderful as it was not very sweet.  The cashier had mentioned that cookies are a once in awhile thing and the croissants are there daily, which is why I chose a cookie as my treat.    I'd go to the Baguette every day if there was one in my hood.  Definitely stop by and you won't be disappointed.  The food is worth the wait!",

    "text": "I've been a regular for several years now, and it's still my favorite place in town. Everything is delicious - everything. Close your eyes and point. Not only that, but you can feel the love and passion that goes into everything both aesthetic and edible. And they care about YOU. I can go for 6 months without being able to visit Baguette, and Olivier still welcomes me like family and asks how I've been as casually as if I'd been seeing him every week.   I see a lot of people complaining about how to find the place.   HERE IS A TIP FOR THE EASIEST WAY TO GET TO BAGUETTE.   If you are driving westbound on the 215, take the Buffalo exit. Go straight through the light at the top of the hill. You will be on a street parallel to the freeway, and you will drive right up next to the business park on your right before you hit Durango. There will be 3 total turns off of that side road (also known as Raphael Rivera Way). Take either the 2nd or the 3rd and you will be at Baguette. It is right in between those two entrances, up against Raphael Rivera. It truly doesn't get any easier than that. See? Not so hard?  If you truly have no choice but to drive through the business park (say, if you were coming east/southbound on the 215),  when you turn off of Sunset do NOT just drive all willy nilly through the middle of the business park. That's how you are all getting so frustrated and hitting dead ends. Look at a Google map. If you refuse to look at a map ahead of time, then stick to the west side of the business park. Take Ganger Rd when you turn off Sunset, and stick closely to that far west side of the business park as you wind your way to the back of the business park towards Raphael Rivera. Eventually you will see that row of buildings that Baguette is tucked into in the very back peeking through the larger business structures.  But seriously. Just look at a map. It's worth it.  *After going today, I noticed that they've expanded their outdoor seating. TONS of places to sit now with plenty of umbrellas, it's very exciting for their lunchtime rush to see some extra room!",

Olivier welcomed us and ran us through the menu and how the place runs. He was both helpful and very friendly. Heard him mentioning a lemon tart to another group who was in there and we ended up having to get one on the way out. Definitely do, it was outstanding!",

Using google directions through yelp I was takin a little off course. If your using google you be directed to the other side of the cooperate buildings. Simply turn into the car park and drive through to get closer to the highway.  Visiting on a weekday during lunch time, I expected a line and it blew through pretty quick. The owner was very nice and had time to chat. He recommended The chicken and The curry. Both were amazing!   Everything is fresh, the actual Baguettes were freshly made. And even though I have driven past this place a million times I will be back real soon!! It's hard to argue with nearly every yelp review on here. Outstanding!

The place, at first was difficult to find, is nestled among the silver office buildings right off Durango and 215.  Really casual place.  Reminiscent of Panera Bread.  It gets really busy for lunch, so prepare to wait, sit outside, or take something to-go to avoid upset; turnover is pretty quick, however, so you shouldn't wait too long to get a table.  The chipotle chicken sandwich, caprese salad, and soups are my favorite lunches to order there.  I am also in love with their tarts!!!  Along with an espresso, I could eat them everyday.  The owners are super sweet and personable.  I only wish they had a bigger, more central location!",

Breakfast or lunch, the food is just excellent.  Great and unique flavors, the food is made with passion.  And just like a good BBQ restaurant, once they run out for the day, they run out.  That's how it should be with something like a quiche.  You make it in your morning batches, keep the quality up and when it's gone it's gone.  Nothing sitting in a fridge or a freezer for days.

Oliver introduced himself and was super nice explaining the menu and the specials of the day.  He had me at vegan carrot and coconut hot soup......a ordered a cup as soon as he explained it and YUM it was good. Sooo good I was dipping my sandwich in it. I ordered a vegan sandwich on a ciabatta bread it had roasted vegetables, hummus, greens, eggplant and avocado. But the super shining star on the sandwich was WALNUT PESTO. I don't know how they made said pesto and I don't even really like walnuts but WOW I need more.  I don't fool around when it comes to coffee. I like it black and preferably bathtub sized. Well, Oliver has that...22oz of fresh hot burn your mouth off ILLY coffee. As some people have described it a \"bowl\" of coffee. He did offer that they have soy, coconut, or almond milk if you wanted it. How nice?!  Hubby got the breakfast special which was a croissant with egg whites and I think it had tomatoes on it also. It's comes with a standard size coffee and a cup of orange juice. It looked beautiful and he said it was super yummy!!! I think all three were $5-6? I can't remember, but I remember thinking it was very good value.  Keep in mind. THIS IS NOT FAST FOOD. It started to get busy as we sat down to our table but I'm guessing it took about 30-35 minutes to get our food. I don't care. I watched how carefully this lady crafted our items. Two thumbs up. My sandwich was very filling and hubby gladly ate every last bite. He even \"dipped\" because I made him ;) he loved it.  I wish every restaurant took pride in their food!",

Everything is made in house.  The croissants are buttery delicious, the different tortes are delectable, and the sandwiches hit the spot without being heavy in the stomach.  The drinks are great as well.  We really haven't had a bad thing yet.  Add the consistent great service and friendly personality of Olivier, his mom, and the rest of the staff and your day is made.  Today I came in for their bread pudding and it's become my new obsession.  It's a must try.",

Unfortunately for me, their hours don't really allow me to eat here too often, but at least I'll have my days off to look forward to for more reasons than just the obvious.  I tried the prosciutto sandwich and my mom got the tuna. They were both absolutely delicious and very hearty for a sandwich. We got an apple tart for dessert, that was tasty. I loved everything about this place (aside from the long wait, but it was lunchtime on a Friday, so that's forgivable).  The owner is very personable and they have such great daily specials. I can't wait to try their fabulous looking soups and some more of ther desserts.   I only wish this place had weekend hours! =)",

Everything looked delicious and since I came in right after opening everything was fresh! The croissants were absolutely beautiful!!! I played it safe and ordered a ham and Swiss croissant. It was inexpensive and totally worth every penny! The croissant was flaky, fall apart, melt in your Mouth buttery-ness. The ham and Swiss the two perfect additions. They melt the Swiss cheese on top of the ham in the oven. My favorite part was when another customer walks in and exclaims \"it smells great in here\" and the guy taking her order is quick to reply \"it's called baguette no. 5 it's like Chanel but better!\" Totally hilarious and showed that he really enjoys his job! Can't wait to take my hubby with me next time!",

Baguette Cafe is on the South West of town.  I live on the far east side.  But, I'm freeway close and from Orange County, so driving is no bid deal to me.  I got lost trying to find Baguette, as it is tucked away in a business complex.  I eventually got a clue and looked for the address on the buildings.  I eventually found it.  The restaurant is small but well kept.  Their displays are amazing and everything looked so good.  The service was nice too.  I like the personal aspect at the counter while ordering.  The guy taking my order asked me about my tattoos.  I like that... a friendly greeting goes a long way with me.  I ordered the Chicken salad.  And, I was informed that they could make any sandwich on the menu into a salad.  But, I kept to my order.  The salad was okay but that was the way I ordered it so I can't complain.  I tend to pick through and separate my veggies.  I'm weird like that.  But, overall it was a nice place to grab a bite.",

It's located in a business park with cute little tables and chairs outside to enjoy coffees, pastries, or any of their delicious plates. Sandwiches, soups, salads, and handmade coffees are made carefully by the staff and Oliver, the most genuine and passionate restauranteur/host I've ever come across in my years of being an adventurous foodie.  In my attempt to change my eating habits, I finally tried the prosciutto salad and it is hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. And it's a salad, people. Almost a honey mustard drizzled over fresh and organic mixed greens, tomatoes, soft mozzarella, mouthwatering prosciutto and salami, sliced onions, and tiny croutons on the side; you're in heaven. The prosciutto sandwich is delicious too. Can you tell I'm Italian? I'm not but it is d*mn good!! And don't even get me started on their pastries. Freshly baked from love and recipes to kill for. Tarts, tortes, and twists; this is THE place for the ultimate cheat meal. The atmosphere is lively and the sweet smiles you get from behind the counter are so welcoming I just love coming here. I find it hard to leave sometimes, sitting at one of their tables outside on a lovely summer afternoon sipping a green tea unlike any that I've had.. If you haven't went, put it on your bucket list.",

The baguette was crisp and thin on the outside, buttery and soft on the inside. I also ordered the leek  and potato soup-not vichyssoise because it was not blended-  but oh so delicious.   Oh my gosh!  I can't even talk about the twisted chocolate croissants that literally melted in my mouth. Unfortunately I live in Henderson and this place is on Summerlin Parkway and Buffalo.

And lord knows making croissants is a VERY difficult process.  I always get the Moroccan chicken sandwich. I've tried the chipotle sandwich and the pesto sandwich, but the Moroccan has the perfect blend of complex flavors that makes for a fantastic sandwich. Sandwiches come with a (small) side salad.   I don't recommend the juices--they aren't the most appealing.",

My friend had the Bleu Brie grilled sandwich with Chicken. We shared the Chocolate tart and the Salted Mango Tart. So. Good.   The generous serving of Quiche was creamy and savory and melt-in-your-mouth. Bacon in every delicious bite! The crust was outstanding. The salad provided just the right contrast of crisp and crunchy, and the house dressing dressed the salad without taking over.  The Salted Mango Tart - wow! I'm not a big mango fan, so I was skeptical. But the flaky crust, light banana-flavored pastry cream topped with glazed, salted mango was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Not too heavy, either.  The Chocolate Tart - To. Die. For. Rich, creamy, and chocolatey goodness in a flaky almond crust! Again, not too sweet, but oh so decadent!  I'll be back!",

    "text": "This place came with high recommendations, and I must agree, they have possibly the best croissant I have ever had.  I will qualify that by saying I've never been to France.  They bake the stuff right behind the counter, and looks delicious when it comes out of the oven.  We got there, walked right up to the cashier and ordered, and then about 12 people walked in.  Good timing.  My rating is for the ham, cheese & egg croissant, and the Americano & cappuccino we had.  They're famous for their breads, and they don't disappoint with this dish.  While you can't get a whole lot of mileage with ham, cheese, & eggs, the bread makes this sandwich.  Crispy outside with tender & chewy inside, the croissant is scrumptious.  The coffee, while obviously high quality, isn't exactly to my taste.  I'm partial to the sweeter, caramel type beans such as Colombian, and I think theirs is more the Ethiopian type.  So this will be up to your preference, but if you like the more earthy African beans, this is a good choice.  Cappuccino is topped with perfectly frothed milk, which you don't find all the time.  4.5 stars for the sandwich, 4 for the coffee.  I plan on coming back to try some of the other breads.  I'm reserving .5 star for the return, at which point it may round up to a 5.",

The chipotle chicken sandwich melts in your mouth with just the right amount of kick. And the chocolate tart? silky and luscious! The coffee on the other hand I could have gone without, I got a white chocolate mocha and cafe mocha with hazelnut, neither drink made an impression. It needed more oomph in my opinion. There's also a bit of a wait for your food after you've ordered because there's only 2 of them, it took about 25 minutes for me to get out of there (there was a group of 3 ahead of me) They take pride in the quality of their food and it's really worth it in the end but I wouldn't go back unless I know I have plenty of time to spare. I wish they were open on the weekends though, it's a nice spot to have brunch with the family. I will surely be back one of these days.",

She had a croissant with scrambled egg and mushrooms. I had a pesto baguette. I didn't want meat or eggplant so the owner suggested mushrooms. I thought that was really thoughtful of him to be okay with the substitution. We also had the chocolate tart.  We found everything to be good and tasty. We did, however, find the chocolate tart a bit too tasty (but that wasn't bad or anything; just we couldn't eat it all in one go).   Price wise... It wasn't cheap but also not overly expensive. I thought it was priced pretty decently. Our total with tax was around $19 dollars. We were both full, after.",

Although this place is hidden in between business centers and is a little confusing to find at first - their customer service and food makes everything worthwhile.   When I first walked in, it was a quiet cafe (reminded me of Starbucks for a moment). As soon as I looked at the menu, Oliver came and introduced himself and is quiet the charmer I must say!  Very observant and easy going, he was eager to introduce me to the menu and what they were making that day. Although I only ordered their croissants and their black iced tea I was impressed with the enthusiam and how fresh their food was.   The croissants were crispy and warm on the inside. I had their chocolate croissant and their cranberry with vanilla croissant. The chocolate croissant was not too strong and very filling. Their cranberry with vanilla croissant was sweet but had a sour kick to it.   If you need a pick me up and want to go to an atmosphere where they will make you smile and want to start your day right - it's Baguette Cafe!   I am definitely coming back here to try their lunch menu :)",

    "text": "For years I had seen Baguette Cafe listed among various coffee shops(?) on the Yelp Las Vegas homepage list of \"Best Food in Las Vegas\", and I scoffed.  No doubt in my mind that Baguette probably had some fine sandwiches, quiches and the like, but I severely doubted that it was worth a trek from UNLV or my house in the Southeast to experience.  If I could turn back time to September of 2009 I would most certainly be Duke of this joint raising my Yelp cred.  Unfortunately I don't have time travel abilities and am stuck with a paltry 8 check-ins here and non-elite status for '16 which I wear with Scarlet Letter-like shame.    The food here is really on point.   I especially am in love with most of the salads they offer.  In particular the Ham, Prosciutto and Tuna varieties just blow me away every time.   In perusing the reviews I saw a random 1 star review which made me pause, and saw the reviewer complaining about the length of time it took for his salad, and wondering why (I'm paraphrasing) \"it took so long to throw some meat and greens together\".   I, for one, am happy that it's not that simple for the staff here to lovingly put together what very well might be the best salads in Las Vegas that I've had.  I've actually stood, drink in hand, watching them prepare my salad-to-go order (yes, that's just as creepy as it sounds), and there's a lot of attention to detail and, dare I say, culinary love going into these.  All of the ingredients, from the meats, cheeses, veggies and herbs always taste fresh and no component seems out of place or unneeded.    I can only put the highest of recommendations on those three salads, as I tried the chicken salad once, as well as the greek salad with chicken, and found the chicken to be bland in comparison to the other protein options.    I haven't really delved into the sandwich options much as the salads demand my attention every time.  Preferring salads to sandwiches is something I would've once only thought a Bizarro version of myself would say.   That's the power of Baguette Cafe.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place and I highly recommend it to all! Everything is always fresh from their smoothies to their sandwiches. The Baguette Cafe is one of my favorite places to go for brunch and it is very affordable.  Food: 5/5 One of my favorite things to get is their croissant sandwiches. They always come fresh and hot when served to you. Another sandwich I highly recommend is the Pesto with bacon. In all honesty, all of the sandwiches I have tried have been very tasty.   Drinks: 5/5 I have tried both their mango and strawberry smoothies and both are amazing. I love how fresh the fruit is and you can tell it isn't artificial flavoring or anything. I also really love their espresso drinks and I highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha Frappe. It's way better than an overrated Starbucks drink.   Staff: 5/5 I've come here frequently and every time the staff never fails to treat me kindly. They are all very friendly and will cater to whatever you need. If you need help figuring out what to get they are more than happy to recommend some of their items for you.   Overall: I love the Baguette Cafe and I haven't been to a place like this that beats their prices. Their food, drinks, and staff are amazing. The Baguette Cafe is as good as it gets!",

My husband loved his coffee ,as he is a coffee lover .  My 4 Stars is for my chipotle sandwich it was ok , nothing spectacular . Next time I'll try something else. Order came out wrong, but the lovely gentleman brought me what was missing. Place is busy and seems to be a good warm vibe :)))  Came back today to try the Moroccan sandwich on a croissant! Was delicious !  Had both soups today and they were fresh and amazing . Coffee is always on point and I love that they have almond milk . Chocolate Croissant was sweet n soft ! I like it.",

Here's a short yet simple way on how I would describe this place.  + Customer service + The aroma and smell + Affordable prices + Vegan friendly, many vegetable options + Fresh food + Very clean  I ended up getting a ham and swiss croissant because I had heard that the croissants are legendary! Perfect butter proportion, and the ham and cheese melted perfectly.  My friend had gotten a Pesto baguette, I didn't get a chance to try it but judging the look on her face she was extremely satisfied.  We ended up staying almost 2 whole hours!  I would most-def come back if only I lived closer! Will be back soon!",

Food is ordered at the counter and delivered to your table.  On this visit I ordered the Vegetable Quiche for breakfast. The quiche contained zucchini, spinach and tomato in fluffy eggs within a flaky crust. The quiche is served with a mixed green salad making it a great combination.  There are many choices of hot and cold beverages. I ordered a fresh orange juice that was very good, not too sweet. If you are a fan of Illy Coffee, this is the place to enjoy it.

You won't find it here. The owner was quick to diagnosed us as newbies and gave us warm smiles and explained the whole menu to us. When he was done, we wanted to get everything on the menu because they all sound amazing! Then, he was kind enough to offer us samples of his two daily soups while we were deciding what to get. And then, of course, we wanted to get the Shrimp Bisque too (simply heavenly)!  Since we went for tea, we ended up only getting a chocolate torte, lemon torte, croissant, thai chai, hot chocolate and white mocha. Please, please do get the tortes. The chocolate one was rich but with a fine balance of cocoa and sweetness. The lemon one was a fantastic explosion of citrus loveliness. I also liked the croissant, tasted just like France's very own.  A relaxed vibe, great food and friendly customer service. What else can you want?  p.s. The other table was having their sandwiches and they look so damn good. I'm going back to have one of those soon.",

Be sure to check out the special sandwiches (for example curry and a Moroccan sandwich were on the menu today) as well as their daily soup.

PLEEEEAAAASE make it a permanent item! McRib people can understand this plea.   I'm kind of a pastry fanatic. I appreciate the level of preciseness that comes with pastries as my wife is quite the baker. So when it's holidays time, we jumped at the idea of ordering 2 dozens of these strawberry goodness.

Cream of Split Pea: a little thicker in conistency, another straight, simple, fresh approach with the ingredients. Nice!  * Soups change on a daily basis.. \"Cream of..\"  Croissant with omelet and bacon: Airy and Flaky croissant, thin egg omelet, meaty bacon,   The Turkey Sandwich: Simple, Clean and Healthy Turkey Sand.. Local Fresh Ingredients makes the difference!  Chocolate Croissant: Croissant itself one of the Best I've had! Unmatched combination of butteriness, softness and flakiness. The chocolate stuffing wasn't sweet nor bitter but just right.  Illy Coffee: I don't drink coffee much but this had a distinct flavor and had a bit of bitter bite to it. Different from Starbucks and Coffee Bean in comparison.  Funky Monkey: Delicious, Refreshing and a little different in a banana way?!..   * Got to meet the owner (Oliver), he was working the cashier at the time. I asked him to suggest a popular item to have for a first timer.. He had plenty to say but what stayed with me was how he stressed the natural and fresh ingredients they use, unlike other places..(local, picked themselves).

This place is 40 mins away from my house and I had high expectation before I visited it. It didn't disappoint me as soon as I walked in. It is a very cute little cafe. All the staffs work here are really friendly with smiles. I told the owner that I am kinda picky about the onion soup and like it less salty. He offered me a small cup so I could try it and see if I liked. It was very nice of him. He also told me chef never put beef stock in soup so it wouldn't taste too salty. After I tried the sample, I liked it a lot. I ordered Prosciutto sandwich, onion soup,seasoned fresh veggie soup, crunchy green salad, Bleu and Brie sandwich and a pear crusted tart. I loved loved their cute presentations. Colorful little soup cups was a plus. Both onion soup and veggie soup were excellent especially the veggie one. I liked the prosciutto sandwich better than bleu and brie one. And the pear crusted tart was the bomb! I was really fulled after eating my sandwich and soup. However I still wanted to tried their deserts since  this place was far from my area. I wasn't sure when I could taste their food again. After my first bite of pear crusted tart, my tummy immediately reserved space for it lol. Owner told me chef put real almonds into the crust, and that was why tart tasted really fresh and tasty. Pear fruits melted in your mouth once you put it in. The only thing I regretted that day was not getting another pear crusted tart to go ugh...  next time I am gonna try their chocolate tart!",

    "text": "Tucked away in a complex surrounded by banks and business buildings, this quaint coffee house is perfect for a lazy brunch. Stepping through the doors, it would be a shame to rush out in such a hurry.   The decor is simple, nothing elegant or pretentious, but the people working makes it comfortable and warm. Chatting with Olivier was a pleasure. Watching him interact with his patrons reminds me that the service industry is not all about how fast the food can be thrown out, how fast people can down it, and turning the table. The people that frequent this cafe enjoy having conversation over superb food. The food talk ignites the wannabe Anthony Bourdain in me.   I am convinced after visiting that I could close my eyes and point to any item on the menu and not regret it. Katrina M. and I was passing a panini around like it was an elicit drug. (Disclaimer: The promotion of illegal substances is not intentional.) That is how good the food is. The three cheese panini with prosciutto was magnificent. The creaminess of the goat cheese and the subtle snap of the mozzarella mellows out the Gorgonzola. The cured ham rounded out the sandwich, giving it just the right amount of saltiness. Grilled crisp on a a crusty ciabatta bread gave contrast to the otherwise texture-less sandwich. The half bacon omelet panini with orange juice and your choice of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate is a steal at $4.95. Ask for it on ciabatta or a croissant will only cost fifty cents more. Being the gluttonous fiends that we are, we ordered a pain au chocolat and a slice of the apple tart. The chocolate croissant was flaky on the outside, chewy on the inside, buttery, and the chocolate melted as soon as it met the fork. I have not had a croissant of this caliber since France. The apples on the tart were crisp. The light layer of custard did not make their crust soggy and was not too rich.    The quality of coffee is important as well. I had ordered an Americano and my friend ordered a coffee. We lucked out, Olivier was brewing a new pot. The few minutes it took was worth it. A good coffee should be strong, bold, and not bitter. No sugar, no cream, full flavor.  The total for a slow two hour brunch and good conversation , $22 before tip.",

My favorite is the eggplant panini with mozzarella and tomato pesto...such a delicious combination of flavors and textures with the melted cheese!  I recommend sitting in the restaurant if you can find a seat.  The sandwiches are served with a small salad and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette if you eat in.  The chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese, bacon and tomato pesto is also very good, as is the chipotle chicken sandwich.  The only one I haven't liked so far is the Bleu Brie.  I will be back to try some of their homemade soups.    Definitely order a coffee and relax a while.  The service is great, Oliver is always very welcoming.  It gets crazy around lunch time, though.  The hours are M-F 7a-5p, and they are closed on weekends.  I always want to go for lunch on Sunday, and have to remind myself that it is closed!",

The cashier, which i think might be the owner was very nice and friendly, which was nice. I ordered an eggplant panini with chicken (no sauce). My boyfriend ordered the prosciutto salad.  My panini was great! The ingredients were super fresh. It came with a mini side salad which was yummy. My boyfriend's salad was also very good. The dressing was a little thick but the flavor was delicious. The meat, mozzarella cheese, lettuce, and dressing combo was great. Only thing is we don't really like pesto and there was a lot of it on the mozzarella cheese. We'll ask for no pesto next time. My boyfriend also got a peanut butter/chocolate chip cookie which he loved.   A couple of things I didn't like - there wasn't too much seating inside, so we got stuck sitting outside and Vegas in the middle of the day outside isn't the most comfortable lunch setting. I couldn't fully enjoy my meal because I wanted to just get out of that sun asap!!  Another thing is, I wish they had more drink options!! But those things were not a big deal.   Overall, it was a good lunch place and I would def go there again.",

    "text": "I really can't express how awesome this little cafe is any more than what everyone else has gushed about it. It's definitely in an awkward location, right off the 215 between buffalo and durango, but don't let that stop you from trying it. Everything is made in-house, with love, and tastes every bit worth that effort.   The must-haves are the pain au chocolat, the apple tart, any of the sandwiches, and definitely the coffee if you're a coffee lover. The owner, a very friendly frenchman named Olivier, actually runs the front of house as well as the counter so I swear you can almost feel like an intimate little cafe in Paris, if you block out the view of banks out the storefront.   I can't wait to come back, as I didn't get to try the soup, but I plan on doing so in the future. The only thing I don't like is that they aren't open on the weekends--which is understandable seeing as they're in a corporate building center, but this place would make a beautiful weekend breakfast/brunch venture where I could take my time and just enjoy everything.",

We got there at 10:30 on a Friday and I told them I heard the quiches were really good.  They only had 2 quiches left so I did without.  That didn't bother me so much since they open at 7am.  What did bother me was that we were notified of that after the sale was made and I was told by the server that I had to go tell the counter person what I want instead.  So I ended up standing in line with people in front of me...again... Then, they were slow at bringing my friend her tea and when she asked for it, it was like he forgot.  In addition, I ordered a chocolate pastry roll and that was forgotten.  My friend said maybe because I paid them a small tip (in advance at check out) the service was bad.  I tried the quiches my friend got, they were good, the chocolate roll (when finally received) was really good and my breakfast panini sandwich was ok.  So my only big comment is the service was really bad.  I took my friends to another breakfast place the next day and the service there was wonderful.  Needless to say, the other place will get my business more.  I may try the place again to pick up a quiche to go but will think twice about it.",

OK, now that I've fallen all over myself, let's get down to some facts:  Tomato-red bell pepper soup w/ mascarpone: Creamy with bright fresh tomato flavors, flecks of fresh parsley in it so you get sudden bursts of parsley flavor. Wow!  Brie sandwich: Chicken, walnuts, brie, celery, and apples are featured in this. I was expecting a fancy version of American chicken salad. No way! Ingredients are lightly grilled together, and pressed into a panini. An unexpected and delicious combination, especially with the added crunch of the celery.  Chicken curry: Lightly roasted bell peppers are pressed in to this panini to make it much better than the typical curry.  Illy cafe': Served in a preheated (with hot water) mug! The caring really shows!   Peanut butter chocolate chip cookie: Good Lord, the thing must have been an inch thick. True flavors of peanuts and chocolate, the best ever!  So, an easy 5!",

    "text": "(My 400th review...Woot, woot!)  During our most recent adventure to Vegas, we were in search for another great sandwich place and we ended going to Baguette Cafe.  Yeah, it was a little out of the way from the Strip, not to mention, it's located deep inside a business park.  Thankfully, I noticed the sign on their building while on the 215 so it wasn't that hard to figure out.  We got there around 11am on Tuesday and it was empty, we figured we'd beat the lunch rush.  The gentleman who helped us, we didn't get his name but I'm assuming he's the infamous Olivier, was quite hospitable.  He asked if we've been there before, offered suggestions and went through all the menu items we were curious about.  In the end, I ordered the Blue Brie Panini and the s/o ordered the Chipotle Chicken Panini.  With one bottled soda and one Iced Tea it all came out to just under $20.  I noticed they had Illy Coffee too, which is awesome but it was too warm to drink coffee. :)  It took awhile for our sandwiches to be made, not sure why.  However, I did notice that their phone kept ringing and Olivier would give each caller the undivided attention that he provided us.  Yeah, that's awesome but at the same time, customers were starting to line up and wait.  When our sandwiches came out, the presentation was nice.  It came with a couple leaves of greens, the s/o said it was a salad because it had dressing, but IMO, it was a garnish but wow, it was tasty.  It would've been nice to have larger portion.  The s/o and I split our sandwiches to experience both.  My Blue Brie was pretty awesome!  The turkey was poached so, it's not your cold cut turkey, so it tasted quite fresh.  It also had apples and walnuts.  I absolutely loved it!  The Chipotle Chicken was good, just a little too spicy for me, hence \"Chipotle\" but who can hate on a sandwich with bacon in it?  The bread however is totally what made both Paninis, it rocked!  They baguette was freshly baked and served warm, yum!  Eat your heart our Subway and your \"Eat Fresh\" slogan, this is the real deal!  Overall, Baguette Cafe is a cute little place that I would love to visit again, maybe on the way to Red Rock.  I'll just have to remember that they're only open Mon-Fri.  At least now I can say I've been to a TRUE French cafe, outside of Paris...casino included!",

    "text": "I'm having a hard time writing this review because just thinking about Olivier and his wonderful croissants makes this girl blush. I think it's a combination of the owner's French appeal and the flaky, buttery goodness of the pastries.  It's undeniable... Baguette Cafe makes my heart flutter.  Everything they offer from the pastries to the soups made daily is made from fresh ingredients. You can just taste it. On my first visit, I had the prosciutto sandwich and cream of mushroom soup. I expected for the baguette to be hard and crunchy but that wasn't the case at all. I took a bite and it was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. On my next visit, I had the chipotle chicken panini and cream of potato and leek soup. Everything was divine. They are good lunch portions and affordable at around $6-$7.   The service and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. You can tell that Olivier appreciates all of his patrons because he tries to get to know everyone by name. He takes the time to explain everything that is on the menu. He is so enthusiastic and passionate about the food that he makes everything sound irresistible. His French accent doesn't hurt either. True to his word, the food is every bit as delicious as he describes.  Unfortunately for me, they are only open Monday-Friday from 7 am to 5 pm. I have actually considered quitting my job so that I can get another job in the business complex where they are located. And then I could have Baguette Cafe for breakfast, lunch and dinner! No, that's crazy right? Darn you Olivier and your croissants for putting these ideas in my head!",

Any sandwich made on a croissant here is heaven.  They have fresh pressed juices, Virgil's stevia sweetened soda, and almond milk on hand for the best lattes (mocha rocha is to die for!).  Also, don't miss out on the tartes - they don't taste \"eggy\" like others and aren't weighed down with too much sugar.  Bianca and Olivier are the two sweetest people, my trip is not complete until I've eaten here.  Thank you, guys!",

    "text": "One of the best things about my job is that I get to work within yards of Baguette Cafe. I've grown to dearly love this place over the last year. The food is always good, the people are sweet and the ingredients are as quality as you can get.   The food, bread, pies, muffins and coffee drinks are all made fresh, in house by Olivier, his mom and dad. All of whom are from France. This seems to also be the congregating spot of the local French population. It's not unusual to see groups of French-speaking people dressed beautifully sipping a huge cup of coffee and dipping croissants into their beverage on most mornings.   I adore their soups. Everyday there are 2 soups. Both usually vegetarian. Creamy Cauliflower, Vegetarian French Onion, Curry, Spinach...the combinations Olivier's dad whips up are phenomenal. Easily, the best soups I've ever had. The sandwiches are made on store-baked baguette and served with the freshest and crispest ingredients. Olivier's dad is such a sweetheart...sometimes I come in and ask for pasta and he creates a dish just for me.   Another dish that I think is marvelous is their pizza. Sometimes they have leek, sometimes roasted tomatoes and mushrooms...whatever they create, it's always sensational. The crust is thicker and definitely buttery and the toppings baked to perfection. Remarkable.   Baguette Cafe's pastries and coffee are another pairing to treasure. The Caramel Macchiato is easily the tastiest and most satisfying morning drink I've had. Paired with their delectable fresh-baked croissants, breakfast is a heavenly experience. The dessert selection varies daily. Today they had chocolate tart and lemon meringue pie. Both made lovingly by Olivier's mommy. The meringue pie was perfection. Sweet, refreshing, smooth and made with actual lemon pieces, this clearly put all desserts to shame. They bake Madeleines in-house daily and have muffins and Pan de Chocolate (also immaculately baked fresh by the mom).   Pricing here is very very very reasonable. $6-$7 for a half and half combination lunch and $3-$4 for a healthy piece of dessert.   A place as delectable as Baguette Cafe is not going to be a local hidden gem for much longer. I've seen it's popularity soar over the year and I know they are going to go places (as they should). Partake in the joy of this cafe before it goes viral!",

Please check all the other positive reviews before caving in on the \"2\" negatives (which seem like one hater and one friend of the competition)  Honestly, you give 1 star if food sucks, service sucks, the place was trashy and so forth.  Give this place a try, most of us LOVE it. And I am sure real Yelpers would never try to ruin business for a company because we didn't have our butts kissed then massaged while being comped a meal!

For instance, yesterday someone in line in front of me wanted a sandwich which had a pesto sauce on it but it had some cheese in it and he was lactose intolerant. They went ahead and made him some fresh pesto without it and threw it on there. Can't beat that.",

I recommend both. The soups are amazing. I'm pretty sure their homemade. I've tried all their creamy soups and have loved them all. The breakfast panini is good too when it's too early for lunch. Their iced tea is organic and I always stick with the green tea. They have illy coffee and illy raw sugar. The only downside is it's kinda small so when it's crowded it can be hard to find a table and it's definitely becoming too cold to sit outside. Sometimes it can take a bit to get your food during the lunch hour because the surrounding office people come in and it gets crowded fast but it's nothing that doesn't keep me from coming back. The owner, Olivier, is very nice and knows a lot of the customers' names. Mine included. You won't be disappointed! :)",

    "text": "finally got a weekday off to check out Baguette Cafe. This place is a complete diamond in the rough. In a town of corporate structure and in your face advertising of today's specials this place stands alone. the vibe feels as though it was neatly dissected from the streets of San Francisco or Seattle and transplanted to our rugged desert land. Olivier greeted us as we walked in and asked our names and took the time to run through the whole lineup of today's pastries, breakfast specials (today was quiche loraine), sand which specials and HOMEMADE soups. All of the pannini's had familiar sounding names but each one seemed to have a special unique twist. I had the curry pannini because i personally am not a fan of curry. Usually it is to overpowering for me and the flavor is just off. I am happy to say the Baguette Cafe single handily changed me. After they're curry panini with actual chicken breast not slices and sun dried tomato's I was hooked. I could have easily donned a Curry baseball jersey and a big foam curry is #1 finger. my wife had the chipotle chicken pannini. Again another home run. Subtle spiciness, moist chicken, roasted tomato's and the contrast of the warm creamy goodness of the contents and the hollow sounding crunchy exterior of a delicious french baguette equal a perfect sand which experience. As if this was not enough reason to return we also shared the prosciutto infused potato pureed soup. Again absolutely divine. the creamy flavor packed soup shows you the one of a kind indulgence of simplicity. this was served with a few freshly seasoned crostinnis. Everything here was delicious and fresh. The fresh part was confirmed by Olivier when he told us everything he uses is fresh. I don't know what kind of secret farmers market he discovered out here or if he has an astounding garden on his roof but the quality of every ingredient and the love put into the preparation shine through. While we were there he pulled a freshly baked apple tart out of the oven. The smell could only be described as heavenly as going into to Joel Robuchon's memory bank of his grandmothers pastry cooking. Olivier told us \"some people sell crack, I sell apple tarts.\" then based on the smell alone there will soon be Dr Drew's Las Vegas apple tart rehab.   Short and sweet - If you have a weekday off go here for any meal or just a coffee and homemade pastry and feel like you have left town and ended up in an artisnal coffee shop somewhere along the coast. Phenomenal.",

    "text": "Let's start with the ambience, it's a regular coffee shop with a descent amount of tables and chairs inside and out. Normally, you would eat in the shop (but we had ours for to go), but while waiting for our breakfast and coffee, I noticed that the servings are in good proportions and they serve beverages on an actual cup (which is rare now since most coffee shops always use to go cups).   For the food, you can taste that everything is made fresh and homemade. As you walk in, you can smell the fresh aroma of coffee and their quiche du jours. For today I got the roasted vegetables quiche (with spinach, mushroom and zucchini; so tasty) and cafe mocha. I have yet to try the chicken curry sandwich (which I read in one of the reviews here in yelp, is a secret menu)   But quiet frankly, the best part of this shop are the owners, he welcomes you and chats with you as he prepares the meals and drinks. He gets to know you and asks if it's your first time or how you've been. He also talks you through the specials of the day. They're vey sweet and hospitable which made the whole experience lovely.",

You walk in through the door and the wonderful smell of fresh bread, pastry and food, and sometimes coffee... Your nose already tells you the food is going to be good!  The menu is fairly simple and the quality is very high.  There are a few sandwiches that are apparently not on the menu, but the owner \"Olivier\" will be happy to describe it to you.  Always a warm welcome from all the staff! Which is a tell tale sign of any well managed business.  I've had the sandwiches, the pastries and the soups, all are fresh and superb!  Coffee is a little weak in strength (I prefer stronger coffee), but smooth and worth a try.  You can't go wrong with this place.  Keep up the great work and quality, we all appreciate it!    Only problem... Closed on weekends! ARRGH!  **waiving fist**",

I was so excited that I decided to find a French restaurant and try real French food. Went on Yelp (of course) and found Baguette Cafe. Came here for brunch the following morning. The owner Olivier greeted me and started to talking to me. I have never met this kind of a welcoming person filled with energy and shining eyes. He introduced me to his workers which I found out later were his family members. And I felt like we knew each other for a long time. That was amazing. He gave me some advice on what to try, and, finally I decided to go with chipotle sandwich with salad, berry torte and some iced tea. My order came fast enough. Everything was very delicious. I'm happy that I was here and definitely this place will be one of my favorite places. When I was going to leave them Olivier shook my hand and thanked me for visiting them. I was so happy with this kind of service. Many business owners must learn a lot from him.  The only bad thing was that they are far away from center and it is a little hard to find them. I'll be back for sure to try their other dishes, especially from their vegan menu.",

My sister and I visited the cafe after an afternoon of hiking and didn't want to completely counteract the work we just put in, sharing two paninis did just the trick! We split the Grilled Eggplant and Chipotle Chicken; both incredible! Swapping halves was a great idea; we were able to try two menu items AND going back and forth from sandwich to sandwich was like tasting it for the first time again!!  The upbeat, personable owner and employees had me thinking the place just opened.. nope, they're really that great! Overall, the place has a unique menu with great prices and a friendly atmosphere! Be sure to bring a friend so you can mooch off each other's food.",

I've always bypassed this place before because it's tucked away and hard to get to and is only open during the week during business hours so I never had the opportunity. But now that I'm on a schedule that can accommodate theirs and seeing all the rave reviews I was compelled to come here in my pajamas in search of breakfast.   I was greeted immediately upon entering and apparently by the look on my face Olivier asked if I had been there before. I told him I was a first-timer and he proceeded to offer me recommendations on their most popular items and informed me of their baking style (from scratch and throughout the day). I went with their popular omelet on a croissant (fresh out of the oven) with bacon. He also asked me if I would like anything to drink; I ended up getting a decaf americano (yea for illi coffee). My mouth started drooling at the sight, smell, and introduction to their cranberry croissant and chocolate croissant (also fresh out of the oven). I caved once my omelet croissant and coffee were ready and asked for one of each to go as well.   The establishment itself is small but cute. Indoor and outdoor seating as well as a small loveseat with a table. Norah jones was playing on the overhead (bonus points). Next time I'm definitely dining in.   On to the food - freakin awesome deliciousness. Words do not do them justice. The food tastes as good as it smells. The croissants are the real deal. Light and fluffy and to the demise of my waistline. I might just say it. The omelet croissant was perfect. I can't even describe it well enough to do it justice. How does an omelet croissant melt in your mouth?? Just try it. The chocolate croissant was decadent. Again light and fluffy croissant with chocolate embedded in it's fluffy goodness. Pairs well with coffee. The cranberry croissant had a high bar to meet, I think I was already on sensory overload by the time I got to it, so I may have to try it on a clean palette to give it a fair shake.   I'm already hooked. Time to introduce my husband to this little slice of heaven. I already can't wait!!",

I went last week, and let me tell you... right off the bat the first thing that impressed me was the customer service.  Oliver was nothing but amazing! I asked Oliver for suggestions on soups, and what he did was get me 2 samples of the soup they were serving.  I went with the Lentil soup, which by the way knocked me out of the water! It was DELICIOUS! I also ended up getting a chicken salad and a green tea.  The salad was amazing! You can tell the quality  of their food is nothing short of FRESH and AWESOME.   This first experience has got me wanting to go back for more! the ONLY complaint i have with this place is the seating.. its hard to get a good seat because of the room size.... other than that, I definitely recommend this place!",

I ordered the roasted vegetable quiche with goat and feta cheeses. It was excellent. My friend ordered the quiche Lorraine. That was good too. The dishes were served with a side of mixed greens and lightly drizzled with homemade balsamic vinegarette. Tasted delicious. The owner, Oliver, was very nice and greeted us when we came in and also delivered our food to our table. He also told us what he made fresh that morning to serve.   We had a cappuccino with our meal and those were excellent as well and those were made to order and he adjusted the sugar level for me as I don't like my Capp too sweet. A nice dining experience overall. I would definite return here and it is not that far from my doctors office. I recommend it for breakfast but I plan on returning for lunch to try a sandwich. A lot of them sounded pretty tasty according to other yelpers.",

The food here was as good if not better than a lot of the food I had while I was in France recently.  Breakfast here yesterday was a treat, especially as Oliver was pulling fresh bread out of the oven while I was standing there.  I had the pain au chocolate, and it was superb to say the least.  The chocolate inside was spread evenly throughout, and it was sweet but not too sweet.  The pastry was what you dream pastry should be like, light, fluffy, flaky and full of flavorful.  Every bite was a mouthful of deliciousness.  I also tried their quiche Lorraine, which was wonderful as well.  It was not heavy nor dense, and the flavors all came through wonderfully.  I am so happy that I discovered this place near my new place, and I know that this place is now my go to breakfast spot.  And a note for all you soon to be first-timers, it's located in the back of the office complex if you enter of Sunset Rd, so don't be worried that you don't see it straight away, just go around the buildings and you'll see it tucked away in the back.  It might be easier if you're coming from east of there to come in off Raphael Riviera, as there's a driveway entrance located right next to the cafe.",

Low and behold they have almond.  I asked for not too sweet, just a touch of flavor and my request was perfectly delivered.  The quiche was soooo yummy!

Baguette Cafe offers indoor and outdoor seating which I love. Their menu looks so good! They have tons of vegetarian and vegan options as well. They also offer amazing fresh soups daily. We both ordered the Blue and Brie sandwich with mushrooms. Baguette gives you the option of mushrooms or chicken on this sandwich.   Since it was such a nice day we ate outside. They have plenty of seating outside among the trees almost makes you forget your in a business complex. They offer benched seating as well as single seats covered in cushions.  Our food came out quickly. Our sandwiches were accompanied by a small side salad with a house vinaigrette. Super tasty and I loved the tang it had. Now that sandwich!!!! Yummy! The bread which was perfectly toasted and I'm pretty sure was home made. It was the perfect vehicle for all the cheesey goodness. There was a layer of sauteed mushrooms and onions. Next came a little blue cheese and a thick slice of melty Brie! I couldn't help but eat the whole thing.   Although Baguette Cafe is pretty far from where I live the food is that good I'd drive that far to eat there again. I'd love to try another sandwich or some of their homemade soups. Love it!",

Gathering medical records from various hospitals for myself and my Gammy, she asked if there was a place to grab some food that didn't suck. Knowing that Dyanna and I have similar tastes and FINALLY being able to check it off the bookmark list, I arrived here at Baguette Cafe. I highly recommend using GPS to find this place. It's tucked in with a bunch of medical offices and business buildings.  The place has a fast casual environment. A huge portion of the space is occupied by the food prep station, espresso bar, and the kitchen. The space was mostly empty and there were a few patrons enjoying the Spring day outside.  The menu is huge and written on a chalkboard, there were a variety of sandwiches, soups, and salads. There were vegan/vegetarian/carnivore options. I talked to the owner, Olivier, and he was knowledgable, answered all my questions, and made me feel welcome.  My vegan cream of veggie soup was amazing. A green mush color, but full of flavor and it wasn't overly salty. It was balanced and delicious. I ordered an eggplant sandwich in vegan glory and my grandma got the tuna salad. Both were nice potion sized and excellently prepared. I love when you can taste freshness and that's what was delivered.  Baguette Cafe was all that I hoped for and all that I dreamed it to be. I can't wait to find myself in the SW area of town to dine her for a quick, comfy, casual lunch again.",

    "text": "ce qui est-il a dire a propos de baguette cafe?  Maybe that it is the greatest cafe in the WORLD!!! Muahahahahahaha  AHEM! Anyway, I frequent this lovely cafe as often as I possibly can. My office is only about 4 minutes away. That's very dangerous. Luckily I have a bit of self control and a tight wallet.   The owner greets everyone as they walk in and gives each and everyone the attention they deserve when you get to the counter. He will answer any and all questions and never rush you away for the next customer. He knows his regulars very well as each business should. It adds that extra touch of special. Only wish I would have is that they be open one day over the weekend, so that I may bring my family more often.  So instead of going through what I have tried, I will just fill you in on my favorite. 99% of the time I go with The Turkey sandwich and I switch out the Swiss for mozzarella. Turkey is always moist and everything is fresh. Caramelized onions are also included on this sandwich. Along side every sandwich is a petite salad with the most delicious dressing. I have yet to figure out exactly what it is. All I know is my mother and I are addicted to it. ADDICTED!! It's like a delicious drug. We also go with a classic black tea which is always brewed to perfection. Occasionally we will do a muffin or cookie, but we have to be extremely hungry.   Let me end it this way, I've never had a bad experience here nor have I had anything that was not delicious!  Delicious is an understatement!!!!",

This place reminds me of all the illy cafes throughout Europe, especially the one located inside the Charles De Gaulle terminal in Paris. The sandwiches are freshly made, toasted to perfection and filled with fresh ingredients and creamy sauces. We also got one of each of the 3 tarts: chocolate, mixed berries and pear, definitely authentic and tasted just like the ones at Charles De Gaulle. The bacon cheese Quiche is an American specialty, and super fatty and tasty. The only thing I have to say is that everything here is twice the size of the ones served at Charles De Gaulle, and the customers are upsized to match!   The line is very long during lunch time, and expect to wait awhile. The owner takes order himself and is very friendly and very cute with his accent. I'm definitely coming back to try their coffee selection next time.",

This place is definitely off the beaten path. It is tucked away in a business complex. Their hours are limited 7-5 Monday - Friday and closed on the weekends. Limited hours and no weekend hours cost them another star. I do understand that the cafe must cater to the corporate clients based on location. Overall, a nice option if if your craving grub similar to Panera but want a small town..feel good greeting from the owner. If you're in need of change in pace or scenery.. give this place a shot!",

Olivier and his staff produce some of the most delicious, yet simple, food you can get in Las Vegas. They do what they do well. I've been frequently ordering the blue brie sandwich with chicken, and my husband prefers the curry chicken sandwich. When you get it to go, it doesn't come with the light salad you get when you dine in, but the sandwich stays crispy and warm due to how they wrap it. Today I felt very sick and my husband picked me up their vegetable medley soup, which really gave me a much needed pick me up. Of course, if it's available, I cannot walk away from here without getting their fruit or chocolate tarts. Their chocolate twist is a great alternative if you're just looking for a pastry as well. I wish more office parks had restaurants witch such amazing food and ambiance! If you can't go during the week, they're thankfully opened on the weekends now for all your brunch needs.",

The food prices used to be cheaper but I could imagine how hard it would be to keep those prices. They used to have a you pick two (1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup, 1/2 salad) for $5-$6 but it raised a dollar which is still pretty okay. He took the time to explain the items that aren't on the menu. I ordered the Moroccan which was grilled chicken, roasted tomatoes and roasted peppers, goat cheese, some kind of aioli mixed with North American spices. It was great! I also ordered a 1/2 turkey sandwich and a cup of onion soup. I really wanted to try the lemon tart and the seasonal fruit tart but I was just too full for that. The fact that mostly all their food items are organic and they can make it gluten free is awesome! Their meats aren't processed. They baked everything the morning of. Everything is fresh. What more can you ask for. Vegas needs to have small cafes like this in every corner!",

We were cheerily greeted by the owner, Olivier, who took the time to ask our names and chat while we ordered. Super nice guy. I ordered the croissant and egg sandwich with added mushrooms. It was light and flaky with wonderful flavor. My boyfriend got the baguette breakfast panini which was good, but he liked my sandwich better. We even took a croissant with Swiss to go because it was that good. The portions are just right  and not huge (might seem small of you're used to a typical American breakfast). Prices were incredibly reasonable and food seemed to be of high quality- not a combination you see often! Despite being busy the service was excellent. My only regret is that we did not try the quiche. Wanted to but we were in a hurry and they were still in the oven. It is not too often I come across such a delightful combination of kind people doing good things with food for a good price. He even uses organic whenever he can and supports local businesses. Can't recommend highly enough. Thank you Olivier!",

It's comfy and inviting. Service is streamlined and improved compared to a couple of years ago. The wait times are more like 10 minutes assuming you do not arrive at peak lunch (when the wait times may be longer, I think). Food quality and taste are still the absolute bomb! I ordered my favorite sandwich the spicy curry during both my recent visits. But ordered once with eggplant and then the next time with chicken. Even tho, I am no longer a vegetarian, the eggplant version is my still my favorite. It is just so tasty. I also can vouch for the strawberry smoothie, the chocolate tart and the chickpea soup. All delicious! And fresh -- some restaurants when they are successful quality and service decrease -- this place has only gotten better.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time today, after driving past it on the 215 many times (and being persuaded by the excellent reviews). My friend and I went a little while before noon, and it was pretty empty. By the time 12:05 came, there was a line to the door!  The service was superior to any other place I've had in Las Vegas. The owner, Olivier, greeted us and spent the time to tell us about the soups and sandwiches of the day. He even asked for our names. The other workers were very attuned to our needs. One of them replaced my napkin and fork when my first ones were used up (usually I have to ask for new napkins).   I ordered the Turkey Sandwich, a Vanilla Latte Frappe, and a chocolate twist pastry (I don't remember the French name for it.)  The sandwich was very good. The bread was fresh, and it came with mixed greens; much better than traditional shredded iceberg lettuce! There was mayonnaise on it (which was not stated on the menu). I hate mayo, but I happily gobbled it up because the sandwich was so yummy!  The Vanilla Latte Frappe is similar to a Starbuck's Vanilla Bean Frappucino, but a thousand times better! It may be due to the Illy-brand espresso, but the frappe at Baguette Cafe tasted super fresh, homemade, and not too sweet. Loved it!  My friend and I each ordered a pastry for dessert. I got a chocolate twisty thing, and my friend got a chocolate tort-type thing (it looked like a slice of pie.) Olivier told us that he would keep the pastries chilled for us until we were ready to eat them, because otherwise the chocolate would melt. Any other place would have just handed us the food to get it out of the way, but I could tell they have pride in their food! The two pastries we tried were amazing and tasted like a piece of heaven.   The only things I would change about this place is the ambiance (there isn't much decoration on the walls or anything fancy about it), and the hours. I would have come here a long time ago if it were open later, or on weekends!  I will definitely be coming back, many times.",

I was lucky enough to find a table indoors. My friend and I ordered the Eggplant Panini (add Prosciutto) which was an explosion of flavors in our mouths. Tomato Pesto whaaaat :D The caramel macchiato was also the best I have ever had. I had mine with soy milk and I am officially addicted to this beverage. Service was also very attentive and great.

Excellent & fresh breakfast croissants, custom smoothies, fresh squeezed OJ and expertly prepared Illy coffee and cappuccino.  The baked goods are made on-site.  The staff was very friendly - especially Anne who took the time to review the menu with us.  I have a lot of speciality French and Italian bakeries where I live and it was great to find one that matches that quality in Las Vegas. Great outdoor seating with music.

It's a small little place hidden in a business complex, but if you're smart enough to find it - then you deserve to eat there !! Think of it as a treasure hunt. If you take the time to find it, you'll be rewarded in the end.   The owner, Olivier, is a very friendly man. If it's your first time, he gladly explains almost everything he has on his menu. And what I liked most, is that he takes the time to find out your name and shake your hand. Not many establishments do that.   Although he does have a set menu, the soups, quiches, & tarts seem to change almost every day. Plus, I do believe he just has other random food items available each day, so be sure to ask him what he has for the day [though, I'm sure he'll tell you before you get the chance to ask].   I had the chicken curry sandwich, an item not regularly available on his menu. Damn, it was delicious. Good flavored curry, tender chicken, great baguette, plus some fresh herbs and such. I hope he has this on a more regular basis.   For you vegetarian and/or vegan folk, he has quite a few options on his menu, and he said he was looking to add more.   The croissants there are supposed to be really great. I wish I could confirm this, but unfortunately I'm not a big fan of croissants. They're just too buttery and flaky for my taste [a lot of people judge me for this, but it's OK. =p]. But, I will comment that they did LOOK good.   Overall, a great place to meet a friend for lunch. Or get some studying done [ free wifi !]. Plus, with an always changing selection of food, you'll always have a chance to try something new. When you go, be sure and eat a croissant for me.",

I am saddened by the fact that this wonderful place is so far form me because I want to be a regular here. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and asked \"You have been here before yeah?\" As I started to say no, the lovely cashier started explaining all of my options and what they are about. She told me how everything was made fresh daily and they are known for their quiche. There was only once slice left so I ordered it. Along with a crispy green salad and a cup of onion soup with curry. When I asked which soup was better the owner brought me a taste of both. I also ordered a cappuccino since in a review someone mentioned it was the best they ever had. I told them I read that, and it was like the pressure was on. However that made no difference, it was indeed one of the best cappuccinos i have ever tasted in life ever. The foam was perfect and the person who made my drink clearly knew a thing or 2 about espresso by the way she pulled my shot. My boyfriend ordered a turkey sandwich that he said he would order again in a heartbeat. They double checked to make sure we liked everything. It was just exactly what I expect from a place I want to give 5 stars to. Nothing was wrong whatsoever from the service, to the cleanliness, to the food and its quality. I guess I could duck a star since they are 40 minutes from my house, but that is THE ONLY negative thing I can say about the place. I can not wait to return to the area and have an excuse to eat here again.",

A couple of weeks ago I finally had a day off during the week and the hubby was also available (double yay) so we decided to have breakfast here.  Baguette Cafe is hidden away in an office complex right of the 215, kind of like Vintner Grill.   I chose a prosciutto sandwich and my husband opted for one of their specials, a Moroccan chicken sandwich. We also shared a bowl of the corn chowder. Wow, everything was super delicious! The bread is amazing and the ingredients are top notch. The corn chowder was incredible as well. Although the portions seem kind of small, the meal ended up being quite hardy. Besides the food being amazing, the service is great too. The owner, Olivier, is super nice and chats up all of his customers.  I only wish they would open on the weekends, but either way, this is definitely in my top three places for breakfast.",

It took them for ever to bring my food. And they brought my food and my wife's drink. Making her wait and have her drink cool down.   They were horribly understaffed.   If they fix this it will be a five star place.   Would not recommend this place to my friends currently.  Update :  So it's mlk day and I'm guessing the owner didn't expect to be so busy. He was kind enough to bring a dessert for free and apologized sincerely for the way our morning went. We never complained about it so he was aware of it.   So I have given it a 5 star.

    "text": "I never knew a good croissant until I found Baguette Cafe. I never knew what a real quiche tasted like until I discovered this place. The best part about finding this cafe is the fact that their entire menu is genuinely delicious!  I am in love with this place!  Situated in the corner of the Centra business complex, Baguette is a treasure worth searching for on Sunset and the 215. If it wasn't for my new job down in the area, I would have lived the rest of my life oblivious to True French pastries and the genius of the owner's parents and their fantastic from-scratch cuisine. The first time I walked in the smell of fresh croissants wafted in the air. They import the dough from France and bake it fresh daily. It has the right pull, the beautiful flaky exterior and a flavor like no other croissant I've ever had. From there I began ordering sandwiches and literally worked my way through the menu. Every single one is flavorful and down right delicious. I'm hooked. The best part? They make my chai tea better than Starbucks. Yum!  If you want a place to eat where you don't have to avoid parts of the menu, or are looking for a family run cafe that makes sandwiches and pastries from scratch, venture down southwest and eat here. It's worth the trip. I eat here every single day and will never tire of their great food. It's simple-sandwiches, soups, salads, and a variety of pastries and quiche daily, along with Illy coffee and variety of lattes and teas--you cannot go wrong. Olivier, the owner, is amazing and will take care of you. His parents cook in the back and are AMAZING at what they do.  I implore you to eat here. Just once. I guarantee it won't be your last.",

We got there at 12:30, which was just in time to beat the afternoon rush.   We were greeted by a European man with a lovely accent, who was very helpful. I settled on the chipotle sandwich with chicken and bacon, ginger ale and the infamous chocolate tart. My total was around $17, so I was expecting greatness.   Service was excellent. Our food was out in less than 5 minutes. I was a little disappointed when I looked down at my plate and saw a white roll, what looked like deli chicken and a side of lightly dressed greens. There was absolutely nothing special about the sandwich. It tasted good, but it was pretty plain. Someone in my party ordered the chicken salad. It literally looked like a bagged salad, and it was around $8. Quinzos, Earl of Sandwiches, Subway, Starbucks... just naming a few places were you can buy a cheaper, tastier sandwich or salad.  After eating my sandwich, I just knew I was going to be blown away by the chocolate tart. Disappointed again! It tasted store bought. Nothing that I'd ever order again.  The ginger ale was good. Bottled of course. I'd go back for that.",

I ordered a cappuccino with almond milk and got a mug filled half with milk/espresso and the other half bubbles. Not the microfoam I was looking for.

The fact that I'm anticipating to eat lunch there everyday should justify my statement.  I love croissants and I've had them in a number of places, including France; and I haven't found a place that does it right than Baguette Cafe (in Vegas). Light, airy, buttery and not to mention FRESH, it baffles me on how they won't initiate a dozen deal by now.  Aside from the obvious obsession, the sandwiches and salads are up to par as well. The Chicken Salad/Sandwich is my go-to choices whenever I'm starving but I'm always sure to try the others whenever the time calls for it. And as other reviews have stated, be prepared to wait in line prior to and after ordering- as everything is made to order.  The staff is friendly and there's multiple seating arrangements outside whenever it's a packed house.  Last tip? Be sure to order a couple croissants at a time. One won't satisfy your day.",

    "text": "Whenever a friend asks where we should go for lunch, I pretty much always suggest Baguette Cafe because 1. they likely haven't tried it & 2. I use any excuse to eat out for lunch at Baguette Cafe. The service is always personable as they're not in a rush to make people decide on what they want.   A fresh menu of daily soups (today was carrot & sweet potato. SOOOO good! My daughter nearly licked the bowl), sandwiches, and salads. My go-to order is the prosciutto salad with an eggplant sandwich with prosciutto. The salad is AMAZING. Fresh mozzarella, pesto, greens, tomatoes, and a creamy vinaigrette that automatically comes on the side without asking. And then the toasted sandwich on their beautiful freshly baked bread with pretty much the same ingredients of the salad + eggplant. I've also tried the curry chicken which is very flavorful, but IMO, doesn't top the eggplant sandwich.   Lastly, do not forget dessert. Yes, you can get a chocolate twist as a dessert, but my kids call that an appetizer. For dessert, do NOT skip the chocolate tart! This isn't typically what I'd order but my friend asked if I wanted to share and I would NEVER turn down trying new menu items. So, we ate this, and forks were scraped across the plate until there was no more chocolate mousse left over and every tart crumb was gone. This thing melts in your mouth like the lightest, most beautiful, airy chocolate. i'll probably be back on Monday to get another slice.",

He makes you feel welcome and as if you're in his home. After I had placed my order and sat down, he brought our food to the table.   I opted for a Quiche Lorraine with Salad ($7). The quiche was delicious. Definitely one of the better quiches I've had in town. The salad was nice, too.  My only complaint is how busy it can be and especially how difficult it is to get a seat.

The cashier (who I think is the owner) was very welcoming and helpful. I noticed that he knew majority of his customers by first name basis which was really nice. There were many appetizing items on the menu, but I decided to go with the croissant & egg. It also came with a small salad on the side. It was light & flavorful, just how I wanted it. It had some type of tomato sauce in it which gave it the extra flavor. I also ordered a carrot, apple, & ginger juice. SO GOOD! The ginger wasn't overpowering & it just went down really well. Overall, I was satisfied with the food and the service. I will definitely come back again.",

She said they are perfect. The place is run by a family- two brothers and their mom (I think). Olivier was the one I met the first few times we went and his warm, passionate and patient presence was so contagious. He would so excited about the quiche being fresh out of the oven!  Favorites: Veggie quiche  The Moroccan with Eggplant or Chicken Tuna Salad Egg Croissant Be the Change Juice  They also have toffee and cinnamon stevia for coffee drinks. And soy milk, and coconut milk as alternative! Love love this place.",

It was a beautiful Thursday morning 730 am and temp was perfect at 73. We ordered The Pesto Sandwhich for me, Croissant & Egg with Bacon and Ham for my husband and chocolate croissant for the kids.  I love what I ordered. Avocado, pesto, sundried tomatoes with chicken and bacon between toasted baguette. Need I say more? ;) My husband liked the flakiness of his croissant. The kids enjoyed their chokie croissants as well. They also offer fresh pressed apple juice which my kids ordered. The coffee they serve is Illy. We ordered cappuccino, which is okay. They have this biscuit latte which I might try next time.   Overall, experience was great. Their place is awesome too. You can sit outside, al fresco. The staff were kind and friendly.   This will be one of our go to places for breakfast, maybe lunch or afternoon snack too!",

At least have the decency and admit you made a mistake and don't think people are this stupid and lie blatantly in my face! That's when I walked out of the store and let him eat his own pie!

Located on Rafael Rivera way...(by no regrets bar) I can't say enough good things about this place...you can eat inside or outside the cafe.  The croissants and quiches are outrageously good and priced just right. Staff and ambiance are just what you are looking for to have a nice breakfast/brunch with friends or as a couple.   You order up front and take a number...(similar to Cafe Leon's) wait was minimal for as busy as it was...first come first serve tables.  BAD Only 1 server bringing out food to tables...she looked overwhelmed but extremely cheerful and attentive to everyone...  P.s. the croissants are so good...best I've had in town.  Better than patisserie manon bakery...just saying =)  great job to your team baguette cafe...5 stars all around",

    "text": "Finally checked out this place after driving past it for months lol. We were pleasantly surprised by the freshness and level of creative flavors coming out of a tiny kitchen. Their service is great; the owners - mother and son - are super friendly and welcoming, which made our visit even better. The food is simply the best I have had at any cafe in Las Vegas. Tried a slice of chocolate tart, egg croissant sandwich, and a cappuccino. Loved every single thing. The tart was so light in texture, yet rich in flavor. Croissant on the egg sandwich was beautifully golden and buttery, with some sort of a lovely tomato spread inside. Cappuccino was perfect and as expected. The only con out of our whole visit would be the dishes, especially the mugs, which seemed to be stained and in need of a replacement, as did the furniture with a few chips here and their.  this sweet family can invest in some new dish-ware and furniture soon.  Overall, this place is a gem! Can't wait to return :)",

    "text": "I somehow managed not to try this place for years despite all the allure and mystique. After an idle Sunday morning, I decided to rectify this issue.  Baguette Cafe is a local breakfast/lunch spot with light French fare. Not only have many of my Yelp friends raved about it, but it has made the national Yelp Top 100 list three years running. I knew that I had to see what the fuss was all about sooner or later, and today I finally went.  The cafe is simple and inviting enough, and it has plenty of seating both inside and outside. The employee at the register (not Olivier, I believe) was friendly and patiently answered all my questions about the still-available pastries (about half the case was empty at the relatively late hour that I went), sandwich breads (baguette and croissant), and quiche. I wanted to try everything, but I decide to limit myself just a bit.  Chocolate Twist ($2.80): my first taste of their flaky and moist croissant dough with vanilla cream and semisweet chocolate. It really does not lack for chocolate. I didn't want to stop munching on this treat, and I was almost considering ordering another one or two.  Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Cookie ($2.45): yep, it's a peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips. It's crunchy enough on the outside and moist and chewy inside. I definitely could've used more chocolate chips and perhaps some peanut butter chips too, especially considering all the flavor I got in the Chocolate Twist. This is a great cookie, but maybe it's just not a match for my personal preference.  Large Caramel Latte Frappe ($4.89): at first, it definitely hit the spot for a kick of caffeine and sugar. I should've stuck to something simpler because I was getting sugar from pastries, and the sweetness wore thin as my day went on.  Vegetable Quiche ($6.00): my first, second, and third impression was that it was undercooked. The quiche was kinda runny and the crust was only a bit flaky golden brown. It seemed slightly underseasoned too, and the flavor wasn't that potent overall - unless I misremembered, goat cheese was mentioned but didn't tickle my palate at all. It was a hefty slice, but there wasn't that much to it otherwise. I don't know if this is the standard here or a fluke, but I have had better quiches at other local cafes. [P.S. The leftovers were much better after a short stint in the oven.]  Blue Brie Sandwich ($7.95) with chicken: got a taste of their baguette through this. Great crunch (as this is a grilled sandwich) and nice chew throughout this bread. I wasn't getting the blue and Brie cheeses to begin with, but they came through when I started on my leftover portion. The white-meat chicken was satisfying in texture and seasoned well, although it's modestly portioned if you ask me. The side salad (with a few bruised leaves) and the dressing were unimpressive though.  Prosciutto Sandwich ($8.25): I got it on a croissant and had it wrapped to go (no side salad here, phew), but I took a few bites anyway before I left. This is actually mainly both prosciutto and salami. Those meats pack a punch, and the copious amount of greens and tomato are on the edge of neutralizing the saltiness (which side of the fence you fall on may depend on palate and other factors). The croissant was flaky and buttery as I expected, but it really shined with a quick toast when I dove into my leftovers at home. Maybe they'll entertain a request at the cafe to toast the croissant before adding the more delicate ingredients?  The best part of Baguette Cafe is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the bread. Everything else wasn't quite top-caliber. It's a solid neighborhood cafe, and I can see why people are fans, but I'd only consider it if I'm passing by on the highway (rare because I live in Henderson) or planning a trip to the newly opened IKEA store nearby (likely to happen sooner or latter). It's definitely not a destination as you might expect a \"Top 100\" spot to be.",

For 1st timers you can order half sandwich or half salads instead of doing a full sandwich or salad.  FOOD 4/5 -Blue Brie, Pesto, and Moroccan w/ Egg Plant Grilled Sandwich were really good.  -Not a fan of the Curry Grilled Sandwich, for me it felt odd putting curry in a sandwich form.  -Salads were light and complimented well with the sandwiches. All salads have the same dressing. -Mixed berry & Pear Custard Tart were great desserts, I heard the cheesecake one is to die for (I have yet to try)  DRINKS 5/5 -Green Iced Tea $2.78 ($1 for refills for tea) super refreshing!  SERVICE 5/5 -The owner is usually working the cashier, and he'll take the time to answer all your questions. -The people working the cafe are fast, efficient, and friendly. I love how quick you get your food, especially if your there just for a lunch break! -This cafe is pretty tiny, and sometimes the line is out the door during peak lunch hours! Gotta be patient for great food in an affordable price :)  What to order: -Moroccan w/ Egg Plant Grilled Sandwich $7.96 -Blue Brie Grilled Sandwich $7.96",

The eggs are perfectly cooked so that the dish is moist, allowing the flavors of the well-chosen vegetables to shine through. The chef cleverly omits over-powering peppers so that the flavor is soft and a good choice for breakfast. Coffee is top-notch and the staff is friendly. If you prefer a plainer approach, the croissants are authentic and just right.",

We went for the egg croissant with added bacon again, but this time as a to-go order. Usually this comes with a nice little side salad with dressing, however as a to go order, this was missed which was quite disappointing, as we'd paid the same amount for a meal that was lacking what we would usually receive. The croissant itself was amazing, maybe even better than the first time! It was so soft and fresh, the ingredients were plentiful and hot and the tomato dressing they add to it really helps balance the otherwise dry ingredients in the croissant. We polished it off very quickly! This would have been a five star review had it not been for missing the side that is usually served with this as that really would have made it perfect! Will return for the croissants for sure! Just maybe not as a to-go order next time!",

I've been coming to Baguette Cafe for couple of years now...Yelp gave me an opportunity to embrace this simple yet respected establishment.    They serve breakfast and lunch with indoor and outdoor tables available...the outdoor seating can be almost as welcoming as the food, especially during a beautiful November day when the Vegas weather invites you to sit outside and catch some sun with your food. I usually get any of their grilled sandwiches with a cup of soup. Most of dishes come with small side portion of green salad. My love swears that their Vegetable Quiche is the best in town and I believe that is True...it often sells out so if you want it, you can call ahead or come early.  We shared Chocolate Tart this morning and it was so good... their pasties made in house so you know it's fresh and French.",

It was the best pain au chocolat I've ever had. It is always my favorite pastry to get at any given cafe - but this one was extra special and freshly baked (and still warm, too!) My plain latte with coconut milk was so delicious and the quiche and croissant sandwich were divine. This is no where close to our house, but I will definitely make special trips back for pastries and coffee again!!",

When we got to the car we checked our order and our sandwiches were missing the bacon. I checked the receipt and I didn't think we paid for it. My daughter went back in to have the bacon added and pay for it if necessary. Here's where it goes south.... instead of hearing the bacon and adding it to the sandwiches the decision was made to add it to the croissants and re heat them causing the croissants to get very dark and crispy on the outside. Now what sense did that make? And why would you ever do that to those delicious croissants. Ugh... so rather than going back in we've decided to never return. The customer service was awesome until then. Oh and the cheesecake -didn't even taste like cheesecake. This was our second time here and we won't return.",

Still LOVE that place. it's located between 215 and Buffalo/Durango they have a very lovely outdoor seating with big olive trees which remind me of south of france. Inside seating is small. when it's rush hour it's kind of crowded between the table, the counter and the people waiting so pick a table near the wall or glass window if you don't want to be surrounded. it's family owned :) Olivier is the owner and his mom does all the amazing tarts and quiches. great family affair! i always order our birthday tarts there (order them in advance) the only negative thing is the wait. their sandwiches and paninis are delicious! love their curry sandwich, eggplant and mozzarella sandwich? the ham and cheese, mannnn i think i can order the whole menu board lol the sandwich bread is so so good.  their salads are fresh and healthy, dressing is miam miam  veggies quiche, quiche lorraine, slice is nice and big when you eat there it comes with a side salad. pastries chocolate croissant,croissant, chocolate twister are baked daily now ready for the tarts?? and orange blossom cheesecake?? you cannot skip the tarts, they are so so good like home made good! it remind me of my childhood when my mom used to prepare them!  on Sundays we sometime come and get breakfast in their outdoor patio. it's nice and calm find this little jewel in the SW before your shopping at IKEA :) funny thing, when i took my husband there, he went strait to the Pilates place thinking it was Baguette cafe! it was hilarious so guys left door is the bakery and right door is the Pilates",

    "text": "Do you like Panera bread but wish it was fancier and had real french people working there?  Then you'll love it here.    Visited on Thursday 8-25-16 at 1PM.  I don't usually come to this part of town but I had went to IKEA and decided to stop by since I've had it bookmarked for 2 years now LOL   $37.94 got me two sandwiches, two small salads, and a watermelon lemonade. I wanted to order a fresh juice (which is almost $7 by the way) but their machine was out of order.    I ordered my food to-go and sat on the filthiest couch I've ever seen and waited about 10 minutes.  My name was called and I looked up to see a dark handsome French man with my bag of food.     $7.95 tuna sandwich-Menu says it has mixed greens, tomato, onion, tuna salad, and olives.  Mine was on delicious crusty and chewy french bread but the olives were missing.  The tuna salad was divine and tasted just like my mom's.  I'd love to try the tuna salad on a bed of lettuce...I bet it's amazing.    $7 three cheese sandwich- a warm baguette with tomato-basil pesto, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  I bit into the sandwich and loved the bread and the cheese was tangy and warm.  I didn't notice the blue cheese on the menu and was shocked that I liked it because I don't like blue cheese.   $6 crunchy green salad has mixed greens, jicama, carrot, celery, red onion, cucumber, and cilantro.  My opinion is this salad is overpriced.  It's very small and has no meat in it and jicama+cilantro+vinagrette is kinda gross.  I did not enjoy it.  It's the same size as the petite green salad which is only $4.50 and I don't see the difference in quality or quantity of ingredients.     My favorite thing besides the tuna salad was the chocolate tart.  It was a generous slice and the ganache was smooth and rich.  The crust was light and delicate and the strawberries on top were a perfect pairing for the creamy dark chocolate.    I don't think I'd go back.  I can get the same thing at Panera bread for about half the price and it's bigger, has more places to sit, and is much closer to my house.",

I ordered a latte which was served with a side of turbinado sugar. I decided to order a croissant to go and it was still warm when I took it home.  It was absolutely delicious.. crispy on the outside and rich flaky layers inside!  The menu had a nice selection of freshly baked pastries, croissant sandwiches and a variety of quiches as well as various cappuccinos and lattes.

Always quality sandwiches (though a bit small) and many nice rotating soups. Not the best fresh baguette (I'd rather go to an actual French bakery in town for that) but tasty nonetheless, especially when dipped in the soup.  I like the creativity of the menu with some African influences on top of French.  And the owners are always there.  A perfect place to have a nice lunch hidden in an unassuming plaza.  I've had the prosciutto sandwich, prosciutto salad, corn and veggie soup, cream of broccoli soup, ham sandwich, mixed salad, and mushroom and brie sandwich.

Truth be told, I've driven past if for a year without ever noticing.    If you're lucky enough to happen upon this place you will likely be greeted by its owner, Olivier, a vibrant Frenchman who will enthusiastically walk you through his menu with a thick French accent and ear to ear smile.  The menu is filled with the freshest organic ingredients and multiple vegan options.  In addition to breakfast and lunch items, there are also a variety of fresh pastries and deserts.  Each dish served is a bit of classic with something special added to bring it to the next level.  Take for example their turkey sandwich.  In addition to the freshness of the ingredients, Olivier adds caramelized onions for an extra zip that puts a smile on your face.   Pair their sandwiches or salads with a cup of their fresh soup for a perfect match.  You can enjoy unusual but delicious soups such as their celery or carrot soups.  They also have more traditional but equally tasty soups such as tomato or vegetable.    Go and explore the menu and the atmosphere - you won't be disappointed.",

We weren't sure if it would be open on that Saturday morning, but I had it bookmarked for a while and it was on the way home back. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was open, and although adequately filled, there was no unnecessary wait times. If you know me, you know that one of the things I abhor is waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a breakfast joint. They had both inside and outside seating.  Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted by Oliver whom I assume is the owner. He was friendly and welcoming, but most importantly appeared extremely passionate about what he was doing. He went over several items that just finished baking and even made a couple of suggestions. Ultimately we settled on the pesto chicken panini and the brie panini with a white mocha coffee. The ingredients were fresh and quality while the portions were fair for the price. I enjoyed the pesto panini especially. The menu is extensive, offering many options for the vegetarian and non vegetarian lifestyles. They had a great selection of breakfast fare including quiche and various croissants.  I am excited to come back and try more of their menu.",

I checked out the menu and ordered Egg Baquette Panini, Coffee, and bottled water.  Took about 5 or so minutes and you can tell everything was fresh.  Coffee (I am a cream and sugar guy) came with raw brown (organic I assume) and real cream a very nice touch.  Oh and did I mention how wonderful the smell was coming in.  Do try it, enjoy the personable service, don't be in a rush and  celebrate the fresh food.  Will come back for pastry's another time for sure.",

The three cheese + prosciutto is my 2nd fave. Their drip coffee is good and the large is definitely a large - a good caffeine boost to start your day.   There's indoor and outdoor seating. I love the outdoor area with umbrellas. It's wonderful on a cool day.   If you're ever in Las Vegas and want something scrumptious to start off your day - whether it's early in the morning or after noon ;) - don't hesitate to swing by Baguette Cafe. The food is tasty, the service is friendly, the environment is relaxing, and the coffee will get you going.",

It had sundried tomatoes and a walnut pesto which didnt have much flavor - also the chicken was very bland. Overall very boring and plain sandwich with a very sad side salad. Not quite sure how this place has such good reviews - Im sure the pastries/smoothies and other items must be delicious.",

It was delicious.  I also picked up a green tea frappe.  Just trying to stay cool.  Everything they made looked and smelt so good. I wanted everything.  They made sandwiches, pastries, soups, salads, frappes, and coffee drinks.  Items are reasonably prices. It was very busy during a mid week lunch and the seats filled up.  There are more seats outside in front and if you're lucky some in the shade of a tree. I was fine with eating outside even though it was hot there was a nice breeze.   I have their quiche and their other sandwiches on my radar.  I'm just going to work my way through everyone's pictures. I'll be here more often.",

    "text": "The Skinny: better than your average sandwich shop with a nicer ambience but not much more than that (3), service: we apparently hit the cafe around 1:00 but it still took 10 minutes for us to get our orders down... and we were the first ones in line (2) value: it's not bad - around $6-7 for a decent sandwich however it's not worth the drive to come here and eat. (3).  This place obviously caters to the office buildings nearby given it's remote location hidden by the towering adjacent structures. We wandered in while the suits were getting their fix of illy coffee with lunch.  First of all, despite it's moniker, this place has nothing to do with baguettes. We ordered two sandwiches - one ham and cheese and one pressed panini with a curry chicken filling.  The bread is more of a ciabatta-type affair - a 6 inch loaf with a dense texture and a little mildy unpleasant hard chewy crust. This is not the light centered loaves with the pleasant crust that I was anticipating.  The ingredients inside the sandwich were very good - the slices of chicken in the curry sandwich was sufficiently moist and tender while the sauce was pleasant. The ham and cheese sandwich was made with fresh ingredients albeit the bread was only okay for me.   I was a little struck by how disorganized the people in the back were - there were three sandwich makers/servers in the back that were looking for direction from the cashier who I believe is the owner. This unfortunately was sufficiently distracting enough (plus he took a phone order in the interim) that it took about 10 minutes for us to place our orders.  Yeah - this place serves a better sandwich than your average place but is it something to go back for or drive across town? I'm not so sure. 3 stars.",

It is sort of a nightmare to find in this little office park, but once you step in, you are transported to the other side of the world into a Euro-cafe. Well maybe not exactly, but it's a great Vegas simulation.   We ordered a salad each and a sandwich to share. The sandwich was a feature not on the menu that day, Moroccan-inspired chicken with goat cheese and roasted peppers. It was fantastic. I scooped every last bite up, even though I'm trying to not eat meat or cheese. (I fail so miserably at my self-imposed dietary restrictions.) The salad was awesome too, with almondy jicama slices and a lot of other veggies.   The highlight of the meal, other than the great service provided by Oliver (who seems to be the owner?) was the chocolate torte. This was incredible. Perfectly sweet and rich, I felt the need to run a half-marathon just to get its sugary creamy goodness off my hips.   I wish I worked closer so that I would have an excuse to go all the time. Loved every bite!",

The question had reached my ears, \"Sarah, where are we eating today?\"  For a while now, I've been wanting to try this place out because of the reviews from yelp, as always.  Plus, it's different to Asian and Mexican food that we've been eating in the past.  My boss decided to drive with me, and thank God she did because if it weren't for her I would've been making u-turns on a constant basis.    We got there and immediately I thought of California.  My boss thought the same since there are tables and chairs outside and the patrons who went there had the appearance of being from Cali.  I can't explain any further than this.  Lax?  Laid back?  Anyway, I ordered the chipotle chicken panini and turnip soup that had brochuto (wrong spelling) in it.  Mmmm... delish! As how my boss describes it after eating hers.  The spice in chipotle was just enough to give the panini that extra umph.  The soup was definitely delicious and I'm almost addicted to it.  I tried my boss's bell pepper and tomato soup and it was just okay.  I think the turnip soup beat that hands down.  Even she said so herself.  Overall experience was awesome.  I'd come back over and over again just to try everything else in their menu board.  Which by the way, they don't have a menu.  I think they change their menu regularly.  I actually like that.",

The staff was extremely friendly, the owner asked us how we were doing and took the time to explain all the various quiches. I've never had a quiche before, and so I tried one and it was delicious! Moist, buttery, and the crust was to die for. My girlfriend and I also got a breakfast baguette to share, and the baguette was so fresh and warm and chewy! They know how to bake here. We also got a chai latte, and asked for it to be less sweet. I really liked it! Finally for dessert we got the cheesecake which was extremely light and airy, and didn't feel heavy at all. I love these kinds of hole in the wall places that really care about the food they make. Everything was home made and I would definitely recommend this place. I'm definitely trying to chocolate tart next. :)",

As soon as we walked into the door we where meant by a slender male who we later found out was from France and had a smile on his face the entire time we where at the restaurant.  My wife had a Moroccan sandwich with all sorts of spices from Africa and she said that it was delicious.  I had the Chipotle sand which.  This sandwich like the other one was grilled and had chicken and avacado and Mexican cheese on it.  While eating are sandwich's we had two large cups of hot chocolate which was perfect.  It was nice and chocolaty with the cinnamon on top and served at perfect drinking temperature.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy the food and atmosphere of this little cafe.",

I ordered a quiche and a cup of soup, and both were delicious. However, even though the food is the perfect lunch, I am equally enthralled by the ginger beverages! They take special care to carry natural beverages (no high fructose), and this time they had straight up ginger ale with chunks of ginger. That alone is enough to earn repeat visits from me!",

The service is quick- very friendly, nice & informative staff behind the counter/register. It's super clean & well kept. Cute interior/ambiance. Cafe style. They serve illy espresso products. I'd totally have one but I drank a ton of coffee this morning and at work!  It's a hidden gem for sure. Its not super packed which is nice. Two girls meeting here for lunch and one said \"I didn't even know this was here...\" It could use a little more seating inside. But it is small so it would be a little packed. Although it's cute it could use a fresh coat of paint, revamped art and more of it & new flooring.$14 something before tip. Sandwich is $8. Got a soup & bag of chips too.",

Service: As I came in, I noticed a very friendly faced man who introduced himself as Olivier. I told him it was my first time, and I wanted his suggestions, but I knew I wanted some of whatever he was making with those watermelons. He told me to try the Eggplant sandwich. He then asked my name, shook my hand, and continued to introduce me to his whole staff.  Wow!  Never felt more welcome walking in a place.   Food: I went with Olivier's suggestion of a half sandwich and cup of homemade soup. I also ordered some of the fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade.  The sandwich was crispy on the outside with warm cheese and grilled eggplant in the middle. The soup was loaded with big chunks of vegetables. The lemonade was amazing.  So light and refreshing, I wanted more, but I was too full.   Facility:  This is a small cafe type atmosphere, but the True charm was the outside seating. I just happen to come on a beautiful day that allowed me to enjoy the almost European atmosphere.  There was comfortable seats, plenty of greenery and soft music playing. Loved it!!!!!  Overall review: definitely a 5 star experience, from the warm welcome from the owner, to the wonderful outside seating, to the delicious food.  I will be back!!!",

Great vegetarian/vegan options. I tried the Moroccan Sandwich (forget what the actual name was) - and it was amazing.  The coffee - well of course it was spectacular too.   Great area for outdoor seating, and also a lovely cafe feel on the inside. Prices reasonable, and portions very fair.

I've tried most of their sandwiches but my favorite is the Moroccan. They make soups daily which are always delicious. Whenever they have the roasted vegetable quiche, I have to have it. It is so flavorful and the best part is that their dough is imported from France. I've had plenty of quiches but they have the best quiches in Vegas by far. They serve illy coffee as well which is a plus. The owner Olivier, always spreads good energy to all of his customers. Aside from the amazing food, Olivier really strives to satisfy all of his customers which I feel is one of the main reason this business does so well. Even if I don't go here often, it is enjoyable every single time.",

I realize they are making everything fresh, but my iced americano took over 10 minutes. That's my only complaint though.

The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads (with various greens and meats), pastries and hot & cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini (w/ ham added) are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch.  The real knocks here are the location (NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app) and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4+ people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!",

Olivier & his family/staff have shown me ultimate perfection in their service & food.  This is a charming cafe with the best ingredients I feel good about eating.  I have told all my family, friends & customers about it.  I even drive from Green Valley to deliver this food to my customers all over town.   They had me at green tea & veggie quiche, but I also found I love the variety of soups, fresh green juice made my way, the desserts (which I am ultra picky choosy about eating sweets & THIS is worth the calories), the salads & my favorite chicken sandwich.  They really have something great here.  Music at the right volume, nice seating & always a smiling face behind the counter. The Baguette Cafe has become my sanctuary in between work appointments, & my first choice when delivering lunch to customer offices!",

We ordered two lattes, two sandwiches, soup and a slice of quiche Lorriane. A few minutes later they had a semi-large group come in and the waiting began.  After about 15 minutes brought us our quiche and soup. The quiche was sort of lukewarm, had far too many onions and the crust was tough. After another 15 minutes of wondering where the rest of our food was they brought the sandwiches. I do not believe they served me the right one, but by now I was a bit resigned. My mom told me the shrimp bisque she ordered was okay but that she did not like the curry flavor it had ... by now we are 3/4 done with our meal and the coffee is no where in evidence. I went back up to counter and politely inquired about it. The young lady blinked at me then the \"oh no\" face appeared. She said she would get that to us next. About 15 minutes later we are done with our food and finally the coffee arrives. We are ready to leave, so I have to walk back up to the counter and a finally get a young man to give us take out cups.  Since this place is far away from both my work and home it would have to be a special trip if I were to go back. I may have to try it again but it is not on the top of my list with all the other choices out there.",

The smell of fresh-baked items when you walk in makes your mouth water!   One visit I had the ham croissant breakfast sandwich which melted in my mouth - so good. The other time I had a quiche and it was cooked light and season well. Also had the fruit tart which is the best I've tasted in town! Perfect crust, fresh fruit and not too sweet.   Would live to see this place in a different setting, like a neighborhood spot with plants and a fountain :)",

    "text": "I am definitely on board with this place: A+!  To my misfortune, they ran out of soup when I got there (around 3 in the afternoon). Soup is my favorite, but I do like me some paninis! A friend and I ordered the 3-cheese panini and the eggplant panini. Both were very delicious and full of flavor! The bread was the ideal texture. I also distinctly identified the pesto within the sandwich and found it to be very savory! Mmm! They were both such great sandwiches and they both came with a little serving of mixed greens. I have no idea what the dressing was, but that was scrumptious, too, and very light!  On a side note, I think a common complaint people have with \"eating healthy\", fresh, or light meals like these is that they don't \"feel full\" afterward. But this definitely had me stuffed in the best way possible! To go with my panini, I had myself a hot chai and it was perfect right down to a tea (tee)! Lol. Never mind the awkward pun... The modern decor is white and bright! The daylight comes in through the windows so beautifully! The simplicity of the decor also brings attention to the lovely photos on the walls!  Lastly, the service was awesome! Everyone here talks of Olivier so kindly and it is definitely True how personable he is to his customers. As someone who likes to experiment with different diets (pescetarianism, vegetarianism, veganism), when he mentioned vegetarian options, I was definitely over the moon. He noticed that and didn't hesitate to ask about it. Who doesn't like genuine, friendly service?!  I'd truly recommend this place to everyone I know, but a significant part of me really just wants to keep it all to myself. LOL...  You won't regret coming to Baguette Cafe!  (p.s. I am sooo coming back for the amazing soup I keep hearing about)",

I tried the Chipotle baguette and oh my gosh it was so delicious. I also tried the Thai Tea Frapp which was also amazing. The only weird thing about this place is the location. It's surrounded by realtor/business offices  so it might be confusing the first time you go there. The service was great too and the staff were very friendly.

It was a tough location to find but well worth it.  The cashier/barista was super nice and had a very authentic frenchie accent :)!! The breakfast sandwiches we ordered were super fresh and delicious.  I don't get wowed very much anymore after turning into a foodie snob but the croissants were fresh, buttery, and just the right amount of crunch! The ham and cheese omelette was made right then and was an excellent compliment to the croissants buttery goodness. I felt almost like I was in Paris or something! I had a coffee caramel frozen drink and the bf had a fresh squeezed apple juice which was were both excellent.  That was something new I had never seen, fresh squeezed apple juice made any way you want it and I would recommend trying.  On the way out, we bought a chocolate twist and chocolate croissant and we were fighting to eat them!! So fresh and melt in your mouth goodness, they were still delicious after one hour.  The server was super nice and was very attentive to all his customers!! I will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "Amazing food! Amazing Illy coffee! Knocked  down 2 stars for the service. Always takes forever to get my food/drink. One of my lattes took 20 minutes and had to remind them how long I waited. Not the first time it happened. Also, everytime I call to order to go, it's always never ready or forgotten - even when I call 15-20 ahead of time. If their service improved, no doubt 5 stars. Their food is so good, I can't stay away even though it's extremely slow service.  I suggest going on your day off or after work, because you may be there a while to get your food. But when you get it, watch out. Highly addictive",

A creator of classic fare comprised of fresh ingredients, the owner Olivier has a mastery of knowing the perfect combination of simplicity and seduction, a quality some celebrity chefs here in Las Vegas have yet to attain. Through my repeated visits, I have met other devotees, who not only return for the guaranteed satisfaction of their palettes, but also for the warmth and accessibility of Olivier, and his staff.  It is only a matter of time before \"Baguette Cafe\" becomes a household phrase.",

    "text": "While visiting in Las Vegas, friends and I stopped by for lunch last week.  The Baguette Cafe is terrific!  I had a moist quiche with flaky crust, alongside the most fulfilling carrot soup I have ever eaten.  We shared an assortment of great, fresh salads.  And, since it was the end of the week we celebrated with a slice of both the pear tart and the chocolate tart.  They were better than what you would hope to get at most high-end restaurants.  Did not mind it being in a business park.  It was relaxing to sit and talk, seated on the outside covered terrace.  It's great to have good, healthy, fresh-made choices for lunch!",

The staff was friendly and brought out food our in a timely manner. My friend and I were the last ones there until closing and they never made any attempt to hurry us out  or make it seem like we were inconveniencing them in any way. Oliver even came over to chat for a bit and refilled my friend's ice tea before we headed out. I had the turkey sandwich and the green juice, both were yummy and I'll be back in the future to try more food!",

    "text": "WOW! Where should I begin?! Well, my boyfriend and I are from San Diego and came to Vegas for auctions (like storage wars) well we had a unit close by Baguette Cafe and yelped this place. We liked the reviews it had and all the hype it had about how good the food is so we decided to give this place a try. When we got there, we were treated very nicely by the employers and the place had a very good vibe, we looked at the menu and had very good choices. I got the chipotle sandwich and my bf got I don't know... I forgot but it was a chicken sandwich anyway, I got a vanilla latte and a banana chocolate chip muffin (yeah we love to try everything that's presented to us especially the dessert case) we sat outside and within I say 10 mins or so we got our food, it looked very delicious and couldn't wait to try it. OMG! It was beyond what I have expected! So delicious and full of flavors, I couldn't believe how good a sandwich was until coming here along with the vanilla latte and some unique soda I never heard of, great quality of food here. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who comes to Vegas or locals. There was this guy who was very approachable to customers and always had a smile on his face, I'm thinking it's the owner so it's always good to see great customer service coming from a person who owns the place. Love Baguette Cafe!",
