    "text": "Always trying to find a regular spot for Korean BBQ. Not wanting all you can eat and having tried many spots in town, we again tried another. Upon entering I saw all Asian customers-good sign! Please keep your eye on the menu and do NOT use the bathroom and you will be ok. Luckily I used the restroom (or tried to but couldn't because each bathroom was completely stuffed with toilet paper!) after eating otherwise I probably would have been grossed out and could not eat there. The walls had dirt and smudged on grease? dirt? I tried to look away ASAP because it's enough to make you sick. But the place was packed and that was a good sign too. Trying not to judge a book on it's cover...  Back to the food, we ordered the meat combo that included 4 meats for $65. Beef brisket, pork belly (extremely fatty in my opinion, but I suppose when I order it cooked at other restaurant's I don't see this much of the fat.) I think most people like the fattiness, just not me. Beef brisket, marinated meat (not bulgogi, something else, it was cut into small chunks). I liked the dressing on the salad, the banchan, soup and steamed egg that came with it. It was pretty expensive but I it seemed like the same price as ordering 2 types of meat which were $30-35 each but you would get a bigger portion of meat according to the waitress. We went for the combo to make it easier since we didn't know what to order. I think next time I would order the meat I want separately since the meat they gave us was very fatty. The service was good, at other Korean BBQ restaurants sometimes they start grilling it for you then leave you alone and while it begins to burn you never know if you should remove it and risk offending them or let it burn and hope they return before there is fire. In this case, the waitress returned exactly when it was ready, each time. It was amazing how good she was with all the customers in there.   I would probably come back and try it again. But really, they need to clean those bathrooms and slap a coat of paint on the wall.",

Korea restaurant tea is complement free. and the set of food is not enough for me. I ask for another small bow of rice , when check out. They ask for 2 dollars for the addition small bow of white rice , I complain to them. But no reply and just keep silence,  I will never go there again.  They got 3star is overrated.",

LOVE it  We always order LA style short ribs, beef bulgogi and a tofu soup.   This time we added an order of Chap CHae (crystal noodles) and we LOVED it!  The mini appetizers of kimchi and other pickles/salads were refilled every few minutes!  I would visit there again in a heartbeat.",

We should try it tomorrow. We came back the next day. Ordered 2 set menu and totally blown away. Service was great, we never have to cook our food. They dont mind that we have a 1 year old baby with us that mess around her food. They check back and cut our meat as well as taking good care of our personal experience. Its enjoyable and we will definetely come back. As we were talking to the hostess/owner and tell her about the place, she proudly said that \"we are number one\". Its a shame that they have such low rating. They also have great side dishes. We will be back.",

They do not have all you can eat, so the offer combos with about 4 different meats for about 65 dollars, the size of the order is good for two people. The food is very good but is truly overpriced. If you compare it with other restaurants you can have all you can eat for about 18-25 bucks. The service is really good and they really put an effort on giving you a good dining experience!",

Combo comes with a drink, which I appreciated since it was already 54 bucks or something. Came with a good amount of sides! I love kimchi, so I finished it super quick and didn't even have to ask for more myself,  the wait staff asked me. Usually when they see you finish a side they ignore it, so that's also a plus. To top it off they help you cook the meat so you can relax and talk...overall I love this place when I'm drunk, idk how it is sober though lol",

    "text": "So my bf and I got here around 3am this is when I realized they're open 24hr anyways we were hungry and to kill time we decided to stop by to get some Korean grub on the last time we were here was about 5 months ago it was around lunch hour so they had more people working I guess around that hour this time we went there was only one lady serving us and pretty much the service sucks like SUCKS SWEATY DONKEY Bolony!!!  Ok back to the real deal; it was just us two and a group of other people there but after they left it was just us, the place was not as clean as I could have remembered (and I was sober too!) the lady came by with our food the meat was frozen when she bought them out so knowing that's not really fresh at all but whatever I'm hungry, she drop one of the meat on the table and still served it to us!!! Gross!! Who knows how clean that table is I'm pretty sure they don't clean down the table with anti bacterial spray or anything but a wet towel because I notice that while she was cleaning the other table after the last group left whatever food is food just hope I don't get sick!!! Really when you're here if they put that meat on the grill and ask you not to touch it trust me you're going to have to touch it and flip it yourself by the time they come back to flip the meat for you you'll be eating burnt meat yep that's how it is every time here so yeah I gave this place another chance and it's just sad how their service hasn't improved not only that the food wasn't that flavorful.  Anyways I really liked this place at the beginning I reaaaaally hope they improve on their service and their food can be better I just know it.   The thing that gets me to come back is the tofu soup and their dipping sauces something about it which keeps me thinking that there are some positive side to this place I don't know it's a confusing feeling haha.   20% discount happy hour after 11pm   Warning their bathroom is pretty trashed along with plumbing issues; the last time I was there their toilets doesn't even flush it was super clogged and the sink doesn't work ether just giving ya guys a heads up.   So yeah overall I wish for a better experience next time when I'm in town I won't give up just yet....",

We brought 6 people and myself (the bride) and my maid of honor were the only one that wanted to eat and they wouldn't let us split an order of brisket and noodles. We're small girls and we just really wanted brisket. It's our favorite and we live in different states so we don't get together often and we hardly ever have the opportunity to get kbbq. It was only Two people eating. Two petite girls at that and the place was dead but our server said we had to do two orders of meat. Which isn't True because my maid of honor lives in Vegas and has been here a million times. So our server was just being super rude and she wasn't accommodating at all. Since she didn't want to serve us at all we left and went else where. Terrible service so even though this place is 24/7 I wouldn't suggest going late night at all because the staff was awful.",

    "text": "We first went to this restaurant because it was open late and it was next to the golden Tiki which is a great place.  They told us there would be a wait so we sat patiently and waited meanwhile while we waited tons of people were being seated that just walked through the door after us. I was fine with that because we were hungry and patient to wait to eat something good.  When we finally got seated we didn't get water for about 10 minutes and then probably menus long after. A woman came over to us and started to take our order but when the phone rang, she ran to the phone. She came back and said she was \"off\" but she would take our order anyway and then the phone rang again and she ran away again.  At this point I'm wondering WHY the customer service at the table is less important then the phone ringing. And if she was off, why not get a waitress that was working to help us? The fact is is that we were the only non-Asian in the restaurant and nobody wanted to help us. This place caters to Asians only. When a woman finally came to take her order she was mad she threw down the menus.. She was huffing and puffing about having to even stand there talking to us. Maybe she was irritated that we had two orders for there and one order to go or maybe she was just irritated that she didn't understand English and she got stuck with our table. Or maybe she just hated her job?? I'm not sure what it was??  Now I am in the customer service industry.  I work literally around the corner from this place. Me and my boyfriend are fully tattooed this could have also been why they didn't want to serve us??  I am used to people judging me/us it's no big deal.  But we had plenty of money. At the bar I work at, I bring home about $300 a day in tips alone.  And I always tip my servers well.  After being treated so rudely... Even with the request of the waitress telling us to go \"next-door\"...we left and did exactly that. {FAT DUMPLING} We had a great meal and was treated with respect. (The bill was $30 and I tipped $15-) I wouldn't ever come back to this place!! What a horrible place to put next to the Golden Tiki which is such a beautiful place!!",

I ordered a combo that came with some spicy tofu soup and a few pieces of short ribs for $18. The tofu soup honestly tasted like mildly spicy water, there was hardly any flavor. The short ribs were somewhat good. The whole time while I was eating, nobody came to my assistance asking if I needed anything else. Minutes later a young lady came and asked me to pay even when I wasn't even done with my food (I found this kind of rude). I told her I wanted to order something else because I was still kind of hungry, so I went and ordered some beef cubes which came out to be $28 (Pretty pricey for a plate with a few pieces of meat). She still insisted me on paying for my first meal and then pay for the other stuff later. The beef came out to be a little over cooked, there was no juiciness to it. The whole entire time, still, no one came to ask me if everything was okay. I wasn't too satisfied with the customer service. All in all, I could've gotten all you can eat korean bbq over at Korean Garden, Tofu Hut, or Sura for way less with better service. Don't think I'll be coming back.",

    "text": "The service took a long time. A few korean people came in after us and got served and got their food before us. It makes me upset. When they gave us the appetizer, those dishes tasted rotten. It was so gross, we couldn't eat it. Even the kimchi was bad. We could only eat the salad. When we got the bulgogi it was pretty fatty. It tasted ok I guess. What really freaked me out and stopped me eatting was this: right after you pick the meat off the hot plate, and put it on ur plate, about 1 min later, it turns white. White like coagulated oil and fat. That pretty much grossed us out and with the rotten appetizers, I'm definitely not coming back here ever again.",

It may be the fact that I am getting old but if I don't insert some kimchi into my body every now and then, I go through withdrawal...   it was around 3am when we came here... and I was craving something spicy so I got the kimchi soon tofu.  Definitely not the BEST I have had but... hey... it's Vegas.  Not LA.  We ordered some soju to go with our late night meal (yeah, I know... more alcohol at 3am) and I'm telling you... something about Chamisil Fresh.... when it's nice and cold, it goes down SOOO smoothly... no matter what time of the day and no matter how sober/intoxicated you may be.  I'm glad that my friend took me here... it's a decent Korean food joint that is off the strip with a Happy Hour (either 15 or 20% off.. i dont really remember) from 11pm to 8am!!!!!   :)",

My bill was $70 including tax and tip (for 4 people) these cheap-skates didn't give us one slab of bulgogi or kalbi. Plus the meat wasn't even fresh.  I've definitely had better and I truly feel like I wasted my money. For nearly $20 per person, you could've gotten all you can eat K-bbq, it's just right down the street next to the 99 ranch supermarket. I don't recommend this place, and I am sure as hell I won't come here again or tell people about it.   For a place praised by celebrities (Hines Ward, Paris Hilton, and Andre Agassi), they must either have low expectations or they were paid/given free meals to say that they liked the food. I call BS on that.. They've been all over the world, and I'm VERY sure they had better. My experience at this place: appalling at best.",

FOOD my party ordered the \"Short Ribs\" and \"Pork\"..   i found the \"short ribs\" average tasting, falling short on marinade, but thought the order of Pork savory.^^  i'm shocked to say that their house salad is kinda \"meh\"...  to me, good korean salad is an IMPORTANT accompanying item to eat with ur meats (especially to wrap the meats in).  PRICING a bit under the average cost of other Korean BBQs in Vegas.   surprising, despite it's prime location (nearest to the highway exit).  CLOSING i hear my other friends enjoy this place...  but, personally, i'm all about the taste of dishes - not ventillation, party atmosphere, etc.",

And unlike EJay, my favorite pieces are the ones that aren't marinated...dip the cooked pieces into the sesame oil/salt and pepper mix, place on a lettuce leaf, add some chili paste, and you're in food heaven.  But even better than the bbq is the amazing, amazing kimchi chigae here!  It tastes just like Mom's!! (ok, no restaurant makes it quite as good as Mom but go with me).  Seriously, it is ridiculously good.  Plus, they add a few pieces of dduk in each serving (a little strange but tasty!).  Oh, and the banchan is great!  I love the Korean-style potato salad (includes small chucks of crisp apples...sounds weird but it really cuts the mayo).  Lastly, DJK has the friendliest servers I've encountered in any of the valley Korean restaurants.",

This is different than the other Korean BBQ place I've been to because instead of just dropping off the uncooked meat at your table, they actually cook it for you right there. So if you like the idea of cooking right at your table but don't want to do the work, this is the place for you.   The quality of meat seemed better than other places but this is not all you can eat. Keep that in mind! You are given rice and plenty of sides in the beginning. (picture posted)",

Maybe I am used to Korean food being flavorful and so delicious that I can't stop eating, but the combination was just a-ok.  The side dishes were also just a-ok.   **The combination did come with a choice of drink.  We had a bottle of soju, but I couldn't have cared less if the free drink didn't come with it.    The service was also sub-par.  Yes, they come to your table and cook the food for you, but I can do that myself!  In fact, it's one of the reasons why I like Korean food!  Also, our water glasses and tea cups were always empty.  I have to ask them to refill it every time.  After the second time of asking, the server pour so much tea that it spilled everywhere.  I am not sure if it was done to prove a point to me, but the thought did cross my mind.    The three of us ended up paying $25 each including tips.  For the bang for your money, go somewhere else.

    "text": "Saying this place is terrible is an understatement.. I wish I could give it 0 stars.  My mother, sister and I were visiting Las Vegas for a few days (we are Korean btw so you can count on us to know what good Korean food is supposed to taste like).  We decided to come here for a late bite at around 11:30pm on a Friday night.  When we walked in, the entire restaurant was COMPLETELY empty with no background music playing, making the place look sad and desolate.  The fact that it was completely deserted on a Friday night definitely irked us..  We got seated by a woman that seemed like she was either the manager or owner.  She seemed pretty off-putting and did not put any effort with welcoming us in, especially when we were the only customers in the entire place.  When we tried to order our food, she told us that a lot of the basic menu items we wanted (all buckwheat noodle \"nengmyun\" dishes, all smaller beers, etc) were unavailable after 11pm, giving the excuse that they have to turn a specific set of their cookers off which are used for the nengmyun noodles.. To me, this is pure laziness.  Because of this, we decided to get a bibimbap order for each of us.  She gave us waters, which tasted like terrible tap water.. At first I thought it was really weak Korean barley water, but then realized that they were serving us tap water that just tasted (and smelled)  disgusting.  We didn't even touch the water, which is sad seeing that it's pretty hard to mess up WATER.  Then they brought out our side dishes (banchan), which tasted either old or poorly cooked.  The kimchi was not even edible-- it tasted very old and sour, and had that 'carbonated' taste which only happens when old kimchi sits too long in the fridge..  The bean sprouts (kongnamul) was undercooked and also inedible.  The blanched spinach side dish also tasted old and was too soggy, as if it was leftover from the entire day at the restaurant.  All the other banchan was mediocre to say the least.  None of it tasted fresh, and was so bad that it even made me lose my appetite a bit.  Finally, our main bibimbap dishes came out, along with a small side of anchovy soup for each of us.  My mom and sister ordered the stone-pot bibimbap while I ordered the regular one.  The white rice that came in their dishes were overcooked and soggy, which made their entire bibimbap dish inside of the stone pot too \"wet\" and mushy... The bibimbap themselves were pretty mediocre too, and I doubt that any of the veggies in them were fresh, just like the banchan they gave us. The anchovy soup was also cold by the time it reached out table, which we barely touched.  In the end, we couldn't finish any of our bibimbap food because of how un-appetizing and tasteless everything else was.  The red pepper paste (kochujjang) that we used in our dishes was more flavorful than the actual veggies and meat in the bibimbap itself...  I couldn't finish most of my bibimbap, so I decided to get the rest of it to-go in an effort to maybe cook it into something tastier.  When I asked for a to-go box, the lady looked at me and my food, then condescendingly says in Korean \"if you take it to-go, the food and rice will get bloated and it won't taste good..\"  Um, excuse me but I didn't ask for your two-cents.  The lady gave us the check and only one small to-go container, so I asked if she could get us another one.  She looked at me as if I made an impossible request, then comes back with another container and a bag, in which she dropped and left on my seat.  After we left the restaurant, we couldn't stop talking about how terrible the food there was.  Yes, it was really that bad.  Maybe their food and BBQ is better during the day, but if that is the case then they really shouldn't have the business open 24/7 if the food can't be consistent!  TL;DR-- You don't go to Vegas to seek amazing Korean food per se, but even so this restaurant doesn't come close to making it on that map.  Very disappointing place and none of their food tasted fresh or even decent.  One of the worst Korean places I've been to in a very long time.  Terrible customer service.  Very unfortunate that many items on their food+alcohol menu is unavailable after a certain time at night, seeing that they are open 24/7.  Highly advise to go elsewhere.",

Granted, we do have a tendency to only go there when it's after hours and everyone else is closed.  My go-to item lately has been their Haejangguk. It's a generic term for a beef hangover soup. It isn't quite as good as when I first tried the dish at a place in Garden Grove, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Then again, I've never had it when I've been hung over.  I've also tried their Galbi Tang. Again, nowhere near as good as this one place in Seoul. But come on now. That's an unfair comparison.",

Some lady got some menus and sat us in the table in the back. There were about 5 tables of people dining in at the moment. We waited 10 minutes for waters (the waitress did not seem to know much about the menu at all, we asked her about the all you can eat bbq and she had to keep going in the back and asking somebody if rice was included) and maybe another 15 to order the first round. We ordered 3 gold all you can eat. Not sure if anyone really spoke much English. (Not a problem). Apparently you can only order 3 meats at a time, so we waited to order the next round about 15 minutes. Still not full, we waited THIRTY MINUTES to order the next round. Meanwhile, the two younger women who we thought worked there (because they had gotten us waters and rice etc) were sitting down, chatting with their friends while the older woman was weeded and working her ass off. Inexcusable. Nobody even came to check up on us. We were still hungry but decided not to order, because it would take a while (and nobody came back to the table) awful service, but I do commend the older woman for working so hard while the younger ones just sat there with friends.   THERE WAS NO DISCOUNT. It even says 20% discount on the door on both sides and there are no disclaimers or exclusions that are mentioned on the paper. The lady refused to give us any discount and was rude about it too. She said that all you can eat is not included in discount. Nobody told us that, and we even asked about it earlier. Never coming back here again. Poor service, but the food was ok. Not worth the price especially since we did not get money's worth.  Once again I will repeat, service was TERRIBLE. I have never had a bad experience such as this.  DO NOT GO HERE.",

Our servers were two young guys who were super nice and did a great job. The food wasn't as good as other KBBQ's in the area (I still prefer the taste of Doh and Gen), but it was pretty standard. The servers were more hands on that in other restaurants, though, which was nice. Altogether, it was a nice little place.

It wasn't very tasty either. I had this strange feeling in my stomach afterwards. Plus, when the soup came out, it wasn't that hot. When you have sundubu, it's supposed to be extremely hot and bubbling. Instead, my sundubu was NOT hot enough...in fact, when I cracked the egg and put it inside, it wasn't cooking. OH MY GOSH. It took a while for the egg to cook, which is not a good sign.   I mean, the staff was super friendly here, and I wish I could rate this place higher, but the food was seriously lacking.

It was more of a pressure to order and rush things.  The other person was more calming and allow us time to review.   - Finally, usually at a Korean restaurant, there are like little dishes that they serve as an appetizers.

I pointed it out to the waitress (\"I ordered pork soondubu, but..where is the pork?) She watched me as I swirl my spoon in the stew, a little embarrassed/shocked and didn't know how to respond, she walked away!! The tofu wasn't the softest--more firm. The broth was ok, it could be more flavorful (maybe lacking salt or anchovie flavorings?) In addition,  i have tasted better seafood/vegetable pancake. The pancake here wasn't entirely crispy. It was a bit soggy. It was hardly touched.  I went here twice for soondubu and both times it disappointed me. I've also tried the soondubo over at Mr. Tofu (which is a few restaurants down) and i think its better. The tofu in Mr. Tofu's soondubus are noticeably softer. I have yet to find a good soondubu place for this cold winter. But for now, I would settle with Mr. Tofu rather than giving this place another try.",

I did the udon (broth too sweet with way too much msg), friends the kalbitang and manduk and noodle soup.  Usually the waitresses will scoop the rice out of the stone pot for you -- instead they came and dropped off a plastic pitcher of hot water with my friends who had the kalbitang.

Not mention that their prices are already a bit higher than their neighbors. So, low marks for skimpy stew and inflexible service. So many others to choose from anyhow!",

The first couple of times my family came here, the food was good, the service was fast, and we left feeling satisfied. Our recent visit was not the same. Service was slow, food was not that good, and now they automatically add tip to the meal, even though my family was only a party of 4. Prices are a little on the highend too. The meat selection is still good as well as the japchae noodles. Not sure if I will visit this place as often as before, but if you're in the area with a large party, where you don't mind the tip being added automatically, it's worth giving it a try.",

    "text": "I am actually a regular at DJK super super late nights/early mornings because I get out of work so late and always seem to crave Korean tofu stew. This is one of the few Korean restaurants open at odd hours and it's close to home so I tend to go out of convenience and habit.   Truthfully, I give their tofu stew maybe 3 out of 5 stars. I enjoy it every single time but it's certainly no BCD soondooboo from LA or sogongdong from the east coast. I have yet to find a tofu stew that can match up to either cities in Vegas. I always ask for it as spicy as humanly possible, and they bring it out mild to medium-hot almost every time.   One of the great things they offer on their menu is their combination (tofu stew + galbi, korean short-ribs) for $14.95 so with the locals discount 20% off, it's a fantastic deal.   I have tried various other items on the menu and the food is overall good... so I WOULD recommend it to people; however, do not expect the greatest of service. Usually the ladies are extremely kind and friendly, but they are understaffed every single time I go. There's 1 waitress running around with her head chopped off serving a handful of tables bbq, side dishes, drinks, etc...  Korean bbq is supposed to include full service (grilling the meat, refilling side dishes)... basically extra attention than your average restaurant. With 1 waitress and anything over 4-5 tables... be prepared to feel ignored. Don't take it out on the waitresses though, they're usually the sweetest of Korean ladies busting their butts!",

This is one of the places that, even though our service was great, I cant judge to harsh on service. That is left for fine dinning.   I have had tons of Korean BBQ and YES this was the real deal.

Maybe I was still stuffed from my meal few hours ago or I just have a tiny stomach, but there's always food leftover here for some reason. All the meats were so delicious, and I love how they cook it for you if you're busy eating. MAMA also ordered the Korean pancake and holy crap this thing is HUGE! It was like a size of a freakin' pie. We had to take it home for leftovers because we couldn't finish even half of it... y'know.. because we're full from 'The King'.   Service was attentive!! Probably because we came at 4:30pmish?? That's when dinner had just started and by the end of the meal people were trickling in. And maybe also because my Managers are Korean... and Koreans only service to other Koreans. HAHA JK ;x  Banchan nom nom. Steamed Egg pot nom nom. :3 Meat nom nom nom :3 Pancake, ehhhh. It's alright..... I'm not a Korean Pancake person anyway. I just want the protein.... y'know... the meat. MEEEAT!  I can't wait to come back here again next month.

I've gone here on multiple occasions during normal hours as well, and while good, it's not the best I've had. In summary, the food is okay, the menu is overpriced, service is so-so (sometimes great while other times not) and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about. Although, I am a fan of the wall of celebrities that can be seen when you enter DJK...I also am a fan of the mini Asian figurines.   On my past two visits, I ordered the Sundubu- a bubbling bowl of spicy soup filled with silken tofu, onions and your choice of meat- sans egg. The first time, I ordered the Haemul Sundubu, which came with an assortment of seafood (shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari). The flavor was good, but some of the seafood was not the best quality. On the second visit, I ordered the Plain Sundubu, which came with pieces of pork belly. The broth was a little salty and much more oily than I like my Sundubu to be. The banchan served were okay as well. I did enjoy the pickled garlic stems. I also enjoyed the complimentary hot tea that they serve.  For good Korean food, I don't have to venture far from my own home. But when I'm out and about late at night and I'm craving Korean, DJK is on my list. Maybe I need to try something other than sundubu the next time around.",

I felt like the brisket had the heaviest scent, but my sister thought the sirloin had the most. I'm not sure if this is typical, as I was told by a local that food from the west coast isn't as good when compared to the east (water quality).

After a night of dancing on the Vegas strip, our Vegas local took us to djk because she said the food was bomb and she always goes there after clubbing. We were seated immediately...... In the far back where the the kitchens are. We all got waters and started browsing the menu. My local friend already knew what she wanted but the rest of us took a minute to decide.  Now, Korean restaurants are notorious for giving shitty service to non Korean customers but my experience here was so much more disrespectful than any other restaurant. First, the ajummas running the place took the orders of the other older Korean party who were seated AFTER us even though we were clearly ready to order. Second, my friends tried to order rice but the lady snapped \"oh we outta rice\" and instead of letting us know what is available, straight up walked away from us and tended to other patrons.  We ended up walking out without ordering. Having made to sit there for over an hour while being ignored and snapped at was too much, we were just hungry. Never coming back here again.",

    "text": "After having a super sad and unsatisfying meal on the strip,  a local recommended that we hit up this place for some tasty korean food so we did!  Food:  1. Banchan sides:  The usual stuff, but my favorites were the kimchi and cucumbers. I would like to point out that their version of potato salad was just sad. It was bland and did not taste very good.. it was at that moment that I was truly appreciative of all the korean restaurants in SoCal that were able to make this side right. Blessed for reals!   2. Kimchi Stew:  This definitely hit the spot! I have been obsessed with kimchi stews lately and I think this was just as tasty as the one from home ! The stew consisted of some rice cakes, meat and of course can't forget the kimchi!   Two star deduction:  1. Service:  This aspect of the business was horrible! Took forever to wave over a server to take our order and when it came time to get the check I had to walk to the front to request for the check which was ridiculous!  2. Pricing:  The pricing of all the items were very questionable. The portion sizes are the same in comparison to those at home. But it is like literally $5-$6 more dollars. I guess it's because we are in Vegas... -_-\"  Final Verdict:  The food is good but I don't know if I want to deal with the lame service again.. we will just have to wait and see.",

If you're not feeling barbecue try their wide variety of appetizers and entrees including the japchae noodles and spicy tofu soups.  The food is consistent and I love getting the dumpling rice cake soup when I'm feeling under the weather or it's super cold outside, definitely hits the spot.  My one complaint is their pricing structure as an a la carte BBQ item is almost equivalent to one of their combination meals which doesn't make sense to me.  The amount of food in the combinations is massive whereas an a la carte order of marinated short ribs was just two slabs of meat.  Convenient location, consistent food and late hours makes it one of the great spots in Vegas!",

We were most of the way through our meal when I asked my mom if she'd try the kimchi and she said no cause it looked sour, and I agreed saying it looked soggy and wouldn't try it... well,  she tried it and made the most awesome NOPE face. Oh and, apparently I'm not to be acknowledged being half Korean and not being fluent in the language. Thank goodness mom is here to help me out and represent the table. We just got the check and my green tea was $5.. what? The most I've seen is $2 and that's if it's not included. Usually some kind of barley or green or black tea is available by default. But the rice was $2, just random. The menu, dude the menu was $38 for kalbi and japchae was at $21. Mind blown.  The nangmyun was \"okay,\" the la kalbi was bland and I kept finding bone spurs, very poorly cut meat.   Dae Jang Keum is the name of a very famous female doctor and chef in the Joseon Dynasty (some Korean history for you!). I think this place is trying to bank on its name and location (Chinatown near the strip) but the food portions and quality are low and the menu made me laugh.. out loud. The server was in the corner either picking her teeth or biting her nails and we didn't see her much bit after what I saw I'm okay with that. There are more people working in here than there are customers. Maybe it's a tourist trap, I'd rather drive further to better, and there's a lot better all around here. And yes,  I am writing this on my phone in a booth in the restaurant.",

It's old, dirty and they forget to bring out our drinks and a few other things we asked for. We had to remind them twice!

    "text": "(Vegas Locals) My wife and I decided to try a different All-You-Can-Eat Korean barbecue and we were in for a surprise and pretty much ended up getting the worst customer service we've ever experienced. Dae Jang Keum (DJK) Korean barbecue at Spring Mountain is a 24/7 Korean BBQ who for what we know just added an \"AYCE\" option on their services. I'll just start this review with the PROS; first off their place is a bit spacious and seating/tables are huge and comfortable, secondly a few of the meat choices are USDA certified meat so you could guarantee the tenderness and juiciness of them and lastly is the fact that they're 24 hours and wait times are quick. ********************* But sadly, here are the CONS. As I mentioned this is an All You Can Eat restaurant and as most or all of us know that there are waitresses that takes your order and brings them to you. Well this waitress started off by greeting us with a frown on her face. Sure, I know that we're not Koreans and I understand that there might be a language barrier of some sort but the least you could do is try. My wife and I are not perfect but I could say that we treat others nicely and with utmost respect but that is far from what we got from them. This particular lady pushes our dishes away when she lays the other plates that we ordered and there are even times where she just pretty much almost just drops it on our table. Nearly everything that you request to her, she always have a *SIGH type of expression where she seems to get annoyed or she completely just doesn't care. After a while, we got tired of how she was treating us so we just asked another waitresses' help and surely that didn't help. This other lady kept on insisting that we have to finish a piece (literally 1 tiny baby octopus) before we could order anything else and she threatened us that we would have to pay for left overs (we're talking about a 2 1/2 inch baby octopus). My wife and I just looked at each other confused and wondering why are we being treated like this. So After finishing that we asked if we could order and she literally looked everywhere for that damn octopus and made sure we ate it. That was just flat out frustrating. Then she puts on a fake smile and sarcastically asked us what we want. Julie and Hailey were the the name badges that they were wearing (I'm sure those aren't there real names). I saw a total of 4 waitresses on our time there. I don't want to get the others in trouble, and I don't want to have to drop names as well but I'm left with no choice because I need protect the character of the other waitresses that we didn't have dealings with. ********************** Service in this place is TERRIBLE. Prices based on their menu (available meat choices/side dishes) are inflated and expensive compared to other similar restaurants. We also looked after receiving such horrible service in YELP to see how other's experiences went and you'll see how we weren't the only ones who complained. *********I DO NOT recommend this place at all and I guarantee that we would NEVER come back.*********  If you have any questions regarding the review or would like any other recommendations on where to go, please feel free and shoot me a message and I would gladly point you to the right direction. Thanks !",

She told us in broken English that it was automatically charged. At first we were going to tip her pretty well since she tried to cook the food on the grill for us, but to be honest she didn't do a very good job at it. She angrily told us that she'll fix it and she promptly came back. She then threw the check down and old us that we had to tip her the minimum of 15%, which was about 11 dollars. Obviously at that point we just paid the amount that was due and did not leave her a tip at all.   I can't believe that she had the audacity to force us to tip her. We are never going back to a sketchy place like this again. If you do go, watch out for them adding a gratuity fee.",

The meat at this place though is great.. I usually get one of the combo sets. For 2-3 people, the Love combo set is perfect. It comes with 3 cuts of meat, daenjang jjigae, gaeran jjim (steamed egg), and your choice of drink (soda, beer, or soju bottle). Rice, sauces, and banchan are a given. The meat is always fresh, the portions are HUGE, and for the Love combo it's like $40. AND don't forget you get a discount for being a NV resident after 11pm!! Also, this place is open like 24hrs and a few blocks from the strip so you don't have to drive your drunk ass too far and risk getting caught before getting some food to soak up that alcohol before driving the rest of your way home.",

    "text": "Eh. This used to be my go to Korean food restaurant. I ordered a pick up order today, the pork tofu soup (soon du bu) and a order of Kalbi. I was so shocked first by the price! Haven't been here in a while but I am pretty sure that the prices definitely have gone up in the past year. Not appetizing. Secondly, my soup was not as delicious as I remembered. There was no flavor! Also felt like i got a smaller portion than usual. Completely disappointing and I don't think I'll be back. I have VERY high standards on Korean food and this was far from it. There are so many other places out there that I will now be looking for a new Korean restaurant. This used to be good, ain't horrible but I've had better.",

We came here for dinner and were quickly seated.  Service is also swift and pleasant.  We had one order of Kalbi for two.  It was satisfying and very tasty.  The side dishes were also very good and servers were glad to replenish them whenever you wanted more.  \"More kimchi please!\"  DJK is in the middle of Las Vegas's Chinatown.  Nearby there are also Vietnamese restaurants and foot massage places.  Not bad if you want to get away from the busy strip for a little bit.",

    "text": "After a LOSING weekend, I couldn't wait to get out of Vegas.  Traffic at 2:00pm on Sunday of the Thanksgiving weekend was horrendous!  I've left many times in the past on Sundays at 2:00pm and have not had any problem.  We decided to have lunch before driving out again.  DJK was actually on my bookmarks to try, so we came.      I ordered the Soft Tofu with Seafood for $9.99 (2 stars).  Right away, something didn't look right - it was not bubbling, bubbling hot that is!  I have NEVER had any soft tofu that was brought to the table not boiling hot with bubbles.  The soup looked really red but it was not spicy at all.  Not only that, it was really bland.  I had to add rock salt to it!!!  My fiance ordered the Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap for $14.99 (2 stars).  It was dry and and boring.  The veggies were unimpressive and you couldn't even find bits of beef that were supposed to be in it.  My fiance asked me 'Didn't I order the Beef Bibimbap?  But where is the beef?'.  He had to add more soy sauce and the chili miso paste a few times to season it.      There were only 5 banchans.  I noticed the other tables (they were obviously Korean) had more than us, like a plate of salad.  I hate it when I go to a Korean restaurant and being treated inferior because I am not Korean.  And whatever it is, this 'discrimination' only occurs at Korean restaurants, not at other Asian restaurants!  For this reason, I'm giving the service 3 stars even though they were pretty friendly.    Unless I am dying of craving for Korean food in Vegas, I doubt it I'd ever return!",

    "text": "We were there on Labor Day Weekend, so I assumed they would be very busy, but in fact we got a table right away and the place was not crowded. That is why I was very surprised with the slow service. We ordered very fast and waited for our banchan and waited a little longer...and waited for about a good 15 minutes after ordering and finally they arrived, I loved the dried fish and the algae thingy, but immediately they brought our tofu soups and kalbi, so I got a little annoyed, fortunately the soup is hot enough (not as hot as other places serve it) that it could wait, but the kalbi couldn't, so we had to eat real fast. Since they were not extraordinarily busy the slow service was a dissapointment.   As for the food. The tofu soup was not the best one I have had, but I'm spoiled by LA Koreatown restaurants, but it was not too bad, it was edible and just what I needed today.  It is also pricier than other korean restaurants in other cities. The Korean bbq seemed overly priced, I usually pay no more tnan $15 per person in LA or even Rowland Heights. The Kalbi was good, small pieces cooked well.   Probably would only come back after a night of drinking for the 20% off and 24 hr service, which is definitely a plus for them. I will try the other place next time and see where they stand. So far asian restaurants in Las Vegas are not up to my standards, compared to LA and other cities known for their Asian neighborhoods.",

    "text": "Update (4/22/07):  So I know I said I'd never be back cos my first experience here was pretty bad, but Boyfriend's Japanese class gets together once in a while, and they decided to go here. I was dreading it at first, but I am extremely glad we went cos this time, everything was just so much better. I'm not sure if it was because we went during full-price hours or if it was because we were with a large group, or maybe they just decided to be nice that day. I can't really say. One thing's for sure, though...I was glad for the change.  I'm kind of at awe at how different the two experiences I had there were. The food was sooo much better! The meat actually had some flavor, and that disgusting garlic oil crap from last time was actually a pleasant dipping sauce this time. Even the little side dishes were better! And the salad was just as good.  The service was also loads better. They actually took care of us! I feel like that's pretty darn important when eating out. Our waiter was extremely patient with the ordering process, since it always takes a while to decide how the ordering and sharing goes down in big groups. They filled our water cups, they flipped the meat for us, and they actually cut the big mushrooms that come with it, which we definitely noticed since it was impossible to eat those the first time.  Two bad things from this trip: chopsticks and bathroom. This place should definitely invest in some better chopsticks because trying to eat with these sharp-edged-blocked chopsticks was painful. The whole all-black thing with their bathrooms might be cool (or creepy) since it kind of reminded me of Magneto, but one toilet was backed up and the other had pee (or some other liquid, since all I saw was black) all over the seat and ground. Ew. But I guess that's more the fault of stupid customers, eh? I'm sure it'll be cleaned up by the end of the day... =\\  Despite those two things, it was really a great experience this time around. I wish I could give it more stars, but I'll just say this is an average of the two times I've been.  ---------------------------------------------  I can't say I've been to many Korean barbecue places, but I do know I enjoyed every single one until I came to this one. Perhaps we just didn't know how or what to order. But I feel like that should never be much of a problem with restaurants. Even if it's not the favorite item that everyone orders, it should still be somewhat good.  So we ordered some beef that was extremely bland. It was also pretty fatty and came with a sort of garlic oil dipping sauce that just made it even more fatty. I still had the icky taste of the oil in my mouth the next morning even after some good brushing, flossing, and rinsing. The glass noodle dish that we got after was pretty good. It was definitely the better of the two. I didn't care much for all the little side dishes, but the beef one and the kimchi were pretty good. The salad that came with everything was good as well. It just sucks that the main 'bbq' part of our meal was the worst.  The place looks nice inside, and it's pretty spacious with comfortable booths. The service was nice when it came, although it was pretty sporadic. I think the prices are comparable to other Korean places, but the place did kind of redeem itself with it's 20% off happy hour from 11pm-8am. (They're open 24 hours.) I hear it used to be 50% off when they first opened, and you'll only find me back there if they fall back to that.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place a 1 star.. for the effort of staying open 24hrs, it atleast deserves 2 stars. But the service there is so horrible... I seriously could not do it. I witnessed something so irresponsible happened at this restaurant that could've gotten it into some major trouble if I wanted to complain about it. So instead of going straight to the health district, Im just going to let people who care enough to take time and read reviews about what they eat before they eat it know so that they can beware in the future.   The other night at 4AM, I went to eat there with my boyfriend. We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience.  The only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded.   The side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary.  The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny.  When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all.   There was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table.   OKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use \"cups\" as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this. It's like management letting you smoke inside a cheesecake factory. I could not believe it. This place is so corrupted.",

Yeah, I know, it's not what it's known for, but I would've thought they would know how to make good soups since their other restaurants do really well.  Yes, I know one of the owners children so I feel bad for giving 3 stars, but honest reviews hold back for no man.  Don't get me wrong though, the soups are alright as with the panchan and stuff.  The meats were decent.  Not the best.  It was better when there was a late night special, but I guess that was just for a short temporary promotional, but at least Las Vegans get 20% off if you show your I.D.  Open 24 hours.  Always nice, and they sure do get a lot more customers than I thought they would for opening 24 hours.  They do give a good amount of food though, and like I said, the food's decent which is why I would've wanted to give half a star more.  Tough cookies though.",

One of the best meals I had the 5 days I was in Vegas.  A friend that lives out there took us out here because we were craving asian food.  We got a ton of food that 6 people could not finish.  The guys tried desperately to finish the last of the pork...but we just couldn't put it down.  The one thing I really liked about this place was, with each combo you get a bottle soju.  The standard green bottle pretty much all korean places have.  I liked it =).  Not far from everything we wanted to do, and a decent price.  About $100 for 6 people?  Included with 2 bottles of soju...I think that's a great deal when your are in Vegas!  11pm - 8am they have a happy hour.  Something sort of different for a place like this.  20% off!  Probably why our meal was so cheap =)",

It's open 24 hours, so it's kind of convenient if you're looking to eat Korean food at any time of the day. We arrived here at 2am, and there was only one waitress for like 6 different tables at that time! She seemed to forget us along the way, but we didn't mind since we were chatting and devouring our food!   Speaking of food, it came out pretty fast after we ordered it. I'm pretty sure it was cooked before and then reheated...I had their hot bibimbap, and it wasn't very good! I was disappointed. There was no flavor to it! The dipping sauce that came with it made it taste a lot better though. The only good thing I did eat here was the bulgogi.   When we got our check, we noticed that we got 20% off, as it was their happy hour (11am-5am). The prices were kind of high for the portions of meat you get; I was kind of surprised as it costs about $23 for a small plate of bulgogi! Geez!  I'm sure this place would be cool with a group of friends to do it shabu-shabu style...Maybe I would rate it higher if I just had their bbq...  I'll give it another try next time, and possibly try their LOVE combination BBQ....",

    "text": "Been coming here for years and this restaurant has become one of my favorites in the valley.  You'd think this joint would be overshadowed by all you can eat KBBQ establishments along Spring Mountain but I've always found myself eating here every time we're near the area.  I guess something about the food in this place I find better than other places around it.  We usually tend to go for their Korean barbecue combinations which is either Love or Queen.  Why get something I can get across the street for cheap?!  Quality over quantity my friend.  This restaurant has also never been closed down by Southern Nevada Health District so I feel far more comfortable eating here than the latter.  Now back to their food, combinations usually come with beef brisket, pork loin, beef flank, soy bean soup, steamed eggs and unlimited serving of salad and homemade banchans (Korean side dishes).  One downside about this place is their service.  Perhaps, I've never really gone here at an earlier time but being the only group at 3 am and still not get decent assistance is quite surprising.  I'm not asking for them to cook every single meat we have on our table as I can do that myself.  If I had to stand up and serve myself water or chase down the server because I want more kimchi is just not cool.  Overall, Dae Jang Keum is one of the better Korean restaurants in the valley.  The fact that they're open 24/7 is a plus since we can drop by anytime we want Korean food!",

Once it was cold, the other time it was hot - and I swear they're both called the same thing.  The 'appetizers' (I have no idea if that's what you're supposed to call them) are great - kimchee, fishcake, seaweed, etc. They even throw a little potato salad in there for me, just so I feel at home.  I was disappointed to see that lunch menu only applies to weekdays, isn't Vegas a 24/7 town (or as the kids call it - 31)? Dinner was just too much to eat. Okay, I admit, I did eat it all.",

Anyways being from the Midwest and not having many Korean BBQ places, this place was actually amazing to me. We ordered a lot of food, for three girls xD. and ate all of it. The staff was super nice, probably because we were the only ones there and probably because they thought we were still drunk.  Anyways, the pricing here was actual cheap ( I thought) compared to the Korean BBQs in Kansas City. Then again, all the restaurants Ive been to in Vegas, I thought were cheap.   Next time Im back in Vegas, Ill be here again =D  P.S they have a wall filled with Korean stars, and they were surprised that I knew half of them ahahaha.",

    "text": "I came to DJK with my family tonight, but I was the only one out of 4 of us who really loved it, which is why I only rated this place with three stars.  My parents both got a dish that is called Galbi with Buckwheat Noodles, which I got to taste. Basically the dish has two parts: kbbq kalbi and a cold soup with buckwheat (soba) noodles. They liked the Kalbi, but the soup was.... peculiar. It has ice in it! Like they were not joking when they said it would be cold. It was like a soupy slush, lol. There was cucumber, ginger, and jicama in it, as well as some type of meatloaf slices. The soup was sour. I wouldn't say the soup was bad, it was just strange. I guess we're just a family partial to warm soup.  My brother got the Dolsot Bibimbap, which looked outstanding.   I ordered the Galbitang. Oh my goodness. Their Galbitang is wonderful, and I highly recommend you order it if you ever visit this place. If there is ever a rainy day when you might feel gloomy or if you feel a bit under the weather and just need a warm and cozy pick-me-up, this soup will do you wonders compared to the plain ol' chicken noodle. The soup was brothy and so full of flavor. I was given a very generous portion of meat, too. The noodles were cooked well and the green onion added enough of its own flavor to really make the dish special. I added lots of black pepper to mine and also dumped my rice into the bowl, just as I usually do with this dish. Perfection.   I would like to comment on their Pan Chan (sp? The little side dishes each table is given to enjoy with their meals). There were two particular dishes I wasn't familiar with - the broccoli and the potato salad. Wow! These were lovely additions to the meal! I finished them completely and so quick! The broccoli was steamed and flavored with sesame oil, simple and yummy. The potato salad was chunky, but also creamy -- a potato salad that was mostly potato and not just a plain mixture of several ingredients. This potato salad highlighted the texture and flavor of the potato well and was a pleasant surprise. I tried their kimchi too, which was fine, but the kimchi at Mother's is better.  Because of the Galbitang, I would definitely visit this place again. Yummy eats, for sure.",

That Galbi is available at a good Korean BBQ place to taste real meat flavor.   Well one of us really wanted that marinated this time and it was an excellent choice.    After 11pm they deduct 20% and it is average price with really good dining I think.     The receptionist was very attentive and we liked her service.  Table waitress is ok.   We had paejyong? Pancake also.  It didn't took my fancy but all small dishes especially Kimchi was very good.    I certainly would come back this place for tofu stew menu and other choices.    They have a semi private dining area for a group dining.   I can use this for business dinner",

For an order of kalbi, you pay about $28, which is about $5-$7 more than it should be.  Other dishes are about 20% higher than other Korean restaurants as well.  For business lunches or if you're looking to introduce Korean food to someone, I would still give DJK some consideration.",

I think it was like 20% or something off the check.  Score!  Anyway, it was a group of 8 of us and we all wanted to sit in the big room with the big table.  The server wouldn't let us probably because it would be a lot of work cleaning . And so we sat in a booth that barely fit us.  Good thing we weren't big people.  When it was time to order, my friends and I got the Korean BBQ Dish Combo that cost around $80.  It had pretty much all the good meats and a ton of side orders.  We ordered a couple bottles of soju as well.  Overall, the food was good, especially since we had some people at the table who liked to cook; I don't.  As for customer service, our waitress seemed like she was in a bad mood, probably because she was the only one working the floor; poor lady.  Luckily, some of my friends knew Korean and had a conversation with her.  She seemed like a traditional old lady.  Good thing they got on her good side.  It was a good night!  All smiles.",

The dish I had was the spicy tofu which comes with an egg in it as a choice. It was good and filled me up quickly. Theyre generous with the sides too. Sides include broccoli, fried tofu, raddish, bean sprouts, and more that I cant think of right now. They are also willing to refill any of them if youd like. Seems like most of their tofu dishes are spicy or comes with meat, so if youre a vegetarian that doesnt like spicy things you might not enjoy it here.  Service was good and there was nothing to complain about really.  Environment is nice with wifi. Its a nice place to gather friends in I think, but I dunno since I have none.  They offer metallic chopsticks which I don't like since it has less friction, but in all fairness of the restaurant they do last longer and are easier to clean.  Pros: good food, service is on par, wifi, generous side dishes  Cons: tofu is limited to either spicy or served with meat and aluminum chopsticks if you care for that.  Advice: its a place to try out really if youre into spicy tofu.",

That's good 'cuz I don't like crowded places.  We order \"Love\" for $45.  That's a tad bit expensive for Korean BBQ (my fav. all you can eat KBBQ spot in LA costs roughly the same) but love is priceless (and this is Vegas, a cheap quality mean is tough to come by) so it's all good.  It also came with all the complimentary sides so common in Korean restaurants and drinks for two; be it soju, beer, soda, or iced tea.  The service was great.  Very friendly.  The meat was tasty and the whole meal was filling.  I could have and probably would have eaten more if there was more to be eaten but I did leave very satisfied.  Though, it should also be noted that I eat slightly more than the average bear.  Overall a great experience and I will be returning again.  Just as soon as I can save up enough money to afford it.",

After waking up at the crack of dawn we Yelped online for a korean restaurant and found this place which had  a overall rating of 4 stars. ABSOLUTELY WRONG! You know when you're very hunrgy and anything you eat tastes great, in the case of this restaurant the food just RUINS your appetites. I ordered the mandu-ddukguk and my gf ordered the soft-tofu galbi combo. Now I'm not sure if it was because it was 7:30 am or maybe the chef wasn't there but my mandu-ddukguk was absolutely horrible. The soup base had a strange sour taste to it and  ruined my appetite. The soft-tofu tasted better then my soup but still wasn't up to par. The galbi that came out was of poor quality meat, the cut of the meat was fatty and had no real meat. Being Korean and living in downtown LA, great korean food is 5 mins away, I'm not usually a snob when it comes to korean food, but this was just horrible. Stay away!",

    "text": "This place was kind of a disappointment. It's an average Thursday night. Wife got her bibimbop, I ordered the galbi which they refused to let us cook at the table since we only had one \"BBQ\" order, which is fine. I understand they don't want to clean more than they have to. No one even made any effort to come by and check on us during the meal or refill my water. Food is average,  ($35 for mediocre galbi, over priced IMO.) service-thumbs down. I will not return.  Might I add, I pulled my credit card out of my wallet to set down on the table and they showed up with the bill before it even hit the table. (All while managing to avoid my empty water glass that I purposely pushed 3mm from the edge of the table)",

    "text": "DJK has been the go-to Korean restaurant for my family and me for ages. We often come here for dinner and sometimes even for their Happy Hour. Their Happy Hour is after 11 PM and you get 20% off your check. We come here often enough for one of the workers there to actually recognize us.   We do realize that there are a lot of Korean BBQ places that offer AYCE and offer cheaper prices than DJK but price isn't really a factor for us. We want the quality and DJK has never failed to deliver that to us. Sure we could go to an AYCE Korean BBQ places but most AYCE Korean BBQ places in Vegas have fallen off the quality latter.   One of my favorite things to order at DJK is their spicy tofu soup. I typically get the version with pork and at medium spicy. Always yummy. I think there only had been one time where it wasn't as flavorful but all the other times it was great. I also love how they would crack in the egg for us too.   We also get an order of pork belly and marinated galbi. What I LOVE is that their galbi is not the thin \"LA short ribs\" or that's what they usually call them at the supermarket. Their galbi is the huge bone with a strip of meat so you're getting meat meat meat meat meat! ;) Their pork belly is always very yummy too. Some pieces maybe really fatty but it's typically a good combo of meat and fat.   The service can be a bit slow sometimes depending on the time of night but we've never really had any major problems.   Yes, I realize that DJK is not the BEST. I've had better in SoCal but this is not SoCal. This is Vegas and as for the Korean restaurants in Vegas, DJK is certainly one of the better ones IMHO.",

    "text": "From reading previous Yelp reviews, I definitely have to agree that aside from the food being good here, they have such horrible service. I was seated right away by the host and because my friend was on her way, we wanted to try and order ahead of time since she was on her 1 hour lunch break from work. Once I was seated, I waited for about ten min for a waitress to come by so I can quickly put our orders in. As I was looking around for someone, I noticed it was not busy at all with only three tables occupied on the other side of the restaurant. The host (who happened to be walking by me) saw that I needed someone. When he finally came to the table, I told him I was ready to order and if he can find out who the waitress is. He just stood there and asked what I wanted to order. It was sorta odd for him to take the order but I didn't care because no one even came to say hi. As for the food, I ordered from the lunch special menu: bulgogi bento box for me and spicy tofu soup with kimchee for my friend. Everything was delicious and we were surprised that the portions were huge for a lunch special. They were even decently priced too. We only saw our waitress a few times- once for the food, another time to give us two glasses of water, and lastly, to hand us the check. The entire time we were eating, she didn't even bother to refill our waters or even check in on us from time to time to see if we needed anything. We had to flag that same host just to ask for hot sauce since we could not find our waitress anywhere.   Overall, I only gave this place three stars for the food and the lunch special prices. Other than that, this place has poor customer service. I gave this place a try and I can definitely say I won't be coming back. There's much better Korean restaurants that have both excellent customer service & food.",

Warning:  the egg does not get fully cooked and you get some runny white even if you let it sit for 10 minutes, but it gets pretty close. Full of ingredients too, it's not just kimchi broth. I also got some spicy bulgolgi to cook at the table. It wasn't too spicy at all and didn't leave the nose or eyes running. Rice and side dishes were good, but the sides weren't too original: two were a scoop of mashed potatoes and some steamed broccoli. The kimchi and pickled radishes were good though. My only hit is the price. This place is not on the strip and any of the table Bbq's are going to be from $30-60. Go with a group to make it worth it. Wait staff was friendly and bathrooms were clean.",

We know most of the workers.. so they always attend to us in the best way... but HONESTLY don't expect that sweet timely attentive & conversating expectations you would get at an American resteraunts... these ladies are there to get your order & get your food out as fast as possible.....   We came here very often when we didn't feel like cooking BBQ at home & didn't want to clean up the grease mess.   The quality of meat is good & I would have to say we get very full.   THE KING $83.95- combination of meats probably the largest portion....  sirloin beef, beef short ribs, marinated beef short ribs, beef brisket, soy bean soup, steamed egg, combination veggies, soju bottle. You also get rive if you ask & all the BANCHAN is good... like actually good side dishes.   They have happy hour everyday where you get 20% off your bill after 11pm!

I'd rather they not include it in the price and give me the option to buy a higher quality bottle (which I would). DJK is a-ok, but I'd prefer one of the many other options in town.",

    "text": "In all honesty, it's very overpriced as it's close enough to the strip/in Chinatown area to still hike up the prices, versus local spots away from the area which are almost $10 cheaper. Plus is that it's open 24/7, cons is that you are definitely not getting nearly the quality you pay for...It was $20 just for japchae, a usual banchan (side) in Korea/anywhere else, and though presentation was...strangely extravagant for such a common dish, the flavor just didn't authentic. That, along with everything else we ate, tasted more Chinese than Korean. I'd rather go to the other Americanized 24/7 Korean joint on the strip than venture out to here. Of course, for real delicious Korean food, you'll have to go where the locals are, about 20 minutes away from the strip so take what you can get!",

As far as cleanliness goes, it is clean. The parking is a hassle though since it's in a place with all the restaurants are in a row. The good thing is you don't have to wait long since it's not packed. Of course we have our favorites, but when all the other places are packed out we go here because it is a decent place to eat.  They get 3 stars because they took long whenever we asked for more meat. They gave us the wrong order a couple times.",

    "text": "I choose my comfort food carefully: It has to be available 24-hours and it has to have a lot to offer - i.e. large portions and a well-rounded taste with lots of flavor.    So what's my current comfort food?  Bibimbap!    I suppose there are far more \"guilty\" comfort foods such as macncheese or a fast food meal, but DJK's Bibimbap with bulgogi is just bliss to me.  A wide range of tastes and it's nothing particularly heavy, greasy, or guilty that I'll feel bad about in a few hours.    But I digress - DJK is located off Spring Mountain and is, as mentioned, open 24 hours.  They offer a fairly decent Tofu Soup with slightly sad collection of banchan late night -always the same, generic, not particularly fresh - coupled with my bibimbap and the late-night percentage discount, it's a fairly nice place to hit for a cheap price.  However, their table BBQ is very expensive - it's a pre-set package that starts around $50-$60 bucks that you essentially need to have several people there to help foot the price.  To me, I don't mind paying for that at Honey Pig, but the quality at DJK is not quite fantastic enough for me to justify the price.    The girl overnight is very sweet and friendly, replacing an older woman who grunted at me instead of using actual words.  Sigh.  But new girl is friendly and offers good service.  I also enjoy the various Korean television shows, from the K-version of American Idol to the world-famous Running Man to Korean news.",

I apologize for my negligence because when I am taking a preemptive strike against a hangover, I come running to you for nourishment and comfort.   Dae Jang Keum is one of the few Korean restaurants that are open 24/7 and doesn't gouge you for it. I swear I am coming to terms with the fact that I need to make it myself, go to K-Town in LA, or move back to Korea to get some of the dishes I miss most.   The menu is large, but has a few time restraints. Having a craving at midnight cuts down the menu, but there are still quite a bit to choose from. Katrina M. asked for something new and would make the waitress do a double take. Was there such a dish available? No, it is as mainstream as you can get. We had ordered the kimchi dolsot bibimbap($13.95). The hot stone pot  crackled while getting to our table, but sadly, there were no charred or crispy rice pieces. The flavors were still amazing. When we broke the over easy egg, the yolk and gochujang bound the rice together nicely. It is searing hot, so watch out. We had also ordered the doenjangjjigae ($9.95). Sometimes it can be too salty from the soybean paste. This one was delicious. Bits of beef, pumpkin, peppers, and blocks of tofu in a stew like broth was good to settle my upset stomach.   From 11pm-6am you can enjoy their happy hour. Have no fear, jumping from one happy hour to another does not mean impending doom. A nice 20% off the entire check will get you food to nurse you back to health.",

The meat was good and had a good marinate.  The seafood was so so.  We did notice some green mold on our oyster mushrooms, but we couldn't get our server attention to complain about that.  We kinda lost our appetite after finding out about the mold.  Since no one came to check on our table, we walked up to the front desk to ask for the check and pay.  I paid for the whole meal with credit, tipped 15%, signed, and started to walk out the door. The lady pulled me back and yelled, \"excuse me, we gave you 20% off, you need to tip us more!\"  Ummmm, no.  It was happy hour and everyone got 20% off.  You gave us no service and the food wasn't that great.  Not to mention the mold and the drinks was never refilled.  Found out she added more tip on my credit card statement.",

I'm sorry but my friends and I are from LA and this \"KBBQ\" spot does not even come close to the ones in LA. It was such a disappointment after partying it up at XS (Sunday) Night Swim that we were still talking about eating somewhere else afterwards.  They are not even All You Can Eat and when we asked our waitress if it was, she responded so angrily as if we were insulting her.  Maybe she thought we were going to get up and leave because it wasn't AYCE.  We probably should've left but starving, we stayed.  OK, yes, it is open 24/7 but that is probably the only PRO here.   CONS (where do I begin??): - Quality:  Sucks.  The waitress brought out our meats still frozen! You can see the freezer burn on it.  And can I get some meat with this fat please? - Overpriced:  We ordered the King Combo for $79.99. Poor quality meat, small amount (even if it was only supposed to serve 3-4 people), and cut into even smaller pieces. - The Fan:  It is supposed to suck up all that smoke right? Not here! it was making it worse and was blowing it at us. Can you say smoke inhalation? After flagging down our waitress through the cloud of smoke we asked her to turn the fan off and that was even better than having it on. -  Service:  My group of 6 friends were the only ones there and there was two waitress both having dinner.  We had to call out for them a few times because they wouldn't check on us to see if we needed refills or anything else. -  The sides:  No comment.  Oh wait, rice was cooked well.  The only thing the waitress was willing to refill was the salad. -  Drinks:  Hot green tea in a tall plastic cup used also for ice cold drinks. -  Silverware:  Chopsticks and spoons kept in bulk in a wooden box at each table.  Im pretty sure I saw some fingerprints on some of those spoons.  We thought about ordering another King Combo but we decided it would not even be worth it.  I could be exaggerating but I'm not.  I will recommend my friends... NOT to go here.",

Feeds 3-4 people, but if you're a hardcore Kbbq gorger like my friends, this actually fed 2 of us \"satisfyingly\". If 4 of us dined, I'd order 2 of the kings to feed us all. Comes with lots of meats (king is all beef, the others have pork options, etc), lots of quality sides (my favorite of all the places I've been to so far), and soju. The bill came out to 75 bucks plus tax. I would definitely come back!!",

Let the manager know, he was extremely unaccomodating and made excuses.  The server never filled our drinks, the food was mediocre at best and food and drinks were pricey. \"Bulgogi\" is the first word in the dish's name and the manager tried to convince us that it's mostly a vegetable dish...just because we're not Korean, not falling for that! So, in addition to our $70 dinner, my husband had to go to the fast food drive thru...we will not be returning to this Korean restaurant.  :(",

If the word \"spicy\" is in the description... how did we end up with this completely non-spicy, flavorless tofu soup? I didn't try the beef, but my friend said it was all bits and pieces of the inedible, leftover beef parts.   We also tried the cold noodles... the broth was like drinking soap or cleaning products. HARSH! but True.   Guess this is what we get for not yelping before eating!",

Friendly staff and will usually accommodate the best they can. Quality of food is good which is important in this type place because it's very easy to want to scarf down the tasty looking meat before it's actually done so if you do happen to eat it a little raw, it's OK and actually better a little raw but only if it's high quality, which I already said it was. Soy bean paste is spectacular and I always order extra. So many yummy little sides and they always change it up so you get different things each time. Everything is well made and delicious.

I don't usually go to Korean restaurant (since My parents are Korean and I can have korean food anytime I want) but my co-workers from Korea wanted have \"home food\" (And they loved it. I quote \"I was very surprise to find Quality Korean restaurant in Vegas!\")  First impression upon arriving to the location, This joint is CLEAN! Everyone is so friendly, had a good chat with couple of wait staffs while they cook the meat on the table top stove thing..   I can't say menus are cheap but reasonable compare to those Korean restaurants on the strip. Also, Korean food is suppose to be little more expensive because it usually requires massive amount of labor to prepare the ingredient in the right way.  Anyways..  DJK is by far The best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. Get a taxi if you are visiting Vegas (Taxi from Luxor to China Town is about $20+) and try this restaurant.  Couple dollars for cab fair but it is absolutely worth it if you appreciate real Korean Food.",

The side dishes were nothing grand. There wasn't one that I liked in particular, but the potato salad and the greens were okay. I was disappointed in the kimchi. I wish it was more flavorful.  We ordered 3 different types of meat, one pork and two beef. I've tasted better. There was nothing spectacular about these meats. They didn't taste fresh.

I think they're under new management and if not they need to train their staff with a little more diligence.  They say when you walk into a Korean BBQ restaurant to not be startled by the enthusiastic welcoming shout but when we walked in it was neither enthusiastic, nor was it welcoming, nor was it even a shout.   We were seated to our table as the waitress practically threw the menus upon it and left us to it without asking what we wanted to drink or basically anything else. Later we had to call on someone to take our order and man came to attend to us and asked us what we wanted to drink and if we were ready to order with an extremely nonchalant attitude.  Throughout the whole meal no one ever came by to ask if we needed anything else or if we needed refills on some of the side dishes that came with the combination order. Our grill became charred and although they looked as they passed by there was no automatic response to change the plating for the grill nor was there any service in helping you grill your meat like typical Korean BBQ restaurant.  We ordered the Jack Combination and I gotta say that their meat/food was pretty mediocre. Didn't look fresh at all, didn't even attempt to try to make it look appealing.   From the start to end of our meal I noticed a drastic difference in the way they treated and greeted customers that were either Korean/non-Korean and that difference was not good.   Note that if you're not Korean don't expect any good service or even any friendly smiles. Whatever you choose to do whether you have the same experiences or not that's fine because I know for a fact that I will not be coming back again.",

Any question anyone asked her about the menu she either didn't answer or was really short. The waiter also hardly checked on us and when she did she left after 5 seconds even though there was hardly anyone there. She took the scissors out of my friends hand when she was about to cut the meat without saying anything. We would have left and only paid for the drinks if they wouldn't have brought out the food right as we were about to.  The food was pretty good, but was really expensive. They also expected us to give them a large tip. The lady came out of the restaurant and told us we needed to give them more even though we left them fifteen percent. I would not recommend going here.",

Met by a grouchy old lady yelling across the restaurant telling the busboy to go faster.  Many open tables but had to wait since the hostess wanted us to sit at a table closer to kitchen.  Apparently she was hostess, server, and  cashier. When came to ordering we requested a set dinner. We were told the set menu we chose for about $80 was only for two persons that we couldn't share.  So we are thinking this is going to cost us over $200 for dinner since we had to order additional set dinners for a family of five. Maybe we were wrong but we believed we we're getting screwed over and walked out.",

Overall, the presentation was good and the variety was nice.  The galbi was well marinated and decent pieces (5-6). The pot stickers were good, but the rolled egg omelet was a little salty for my taste. I wish the salad dressing was a little different- seemed kind of soy sauces based salty for me.  Overall, it was a good lunch with a variety of small dishes. The galbi was good and the service was very friendly and accommodating.",

There wasn't any wait time so that was the plus side but it took them 20 mins for them to give us water and an extra 10 mins to take our order.. and when we did order, our order was half right. When we asked them about it the server just brushed us off.. At an AYCE place you want to keep a flow of meat coming so your not full.. but we waited 20 mins in-between.. to order more.. I understand they were busy with only two servers but still they should at least get the order right so they dont have to worry about us.. Anyways we finished and started to order desserts. Mango,mango, and melona.. instead we got banana banana and melona haha.. my gf asked if we can get mango but the server ignored us haha.. Sum it all up. MEATS okay for ayce but I'd rather go to hawaro and wait an hour rather than eat here again. Service needs alot of improvement..",

Their kimchi seems like it's been fermented for a lifetime too long.  Kalbi is a little less seasoned than I'm used to but good nonetheless. Goes great with the pork soon dubu or seafood.

I walked in to the restaurant because I had questions about the AYCE options and I wanted to scope out restaurants in the plaza before my family and I committed to one for dinner. The hostess was on the phone and was unable to answer my questions. That's fine. I've worked service jobs before, I know the deal. I turned to an older woman in uniform and asked her if they had prices for AYCE that I could see. She said \"no\" and turned away. At this, I was sooooo confused. How do you just answer no to a question that requires actual answers? I figured it must be a misunderstanding and I ask another older woman (again, not the hostess) about AYCE options and prices. She gives me a clearly exasperated and annoyed look and says \"We don't have AYCE here.\" I felt that this must be a joke. Previous Yelp users had talked about it in their reviews. There was literally a sign on the front that said they had AYCE options. I don't know if they didn't want my business or if they just didn't feel up to answering but I wasn't going to stick around to find out.  I left immediately. Tip for the owners: manage your workers appropriately and teach them how to act. That way you'll actually be able to have customers during the peak dinner time hours.",

I've seen places that really make you ignore the overhead vents because of the decoration around the room; this isn't one of them!   Service: 3 - The restaurant wasn't that filled, so it was fast for them to take our orders and bring out the food. After that, they didn't provide us service any longer: they didn't fill our water or come around very much to check on how we were doing. It even took a crazy long time for them to bring us our bill!   Even though they were very nice, the amount of time that it took to do these things was a little unacceptable with their practically empty restaurant.   Food: 2 - The silverware is kept on a box near the wall, which I don't like. I feel that it's very unsanitary since anyone can touch your spoon. Also, walls near tables can be the dirtiest places--not a good space for spoons!   The sides were of average quality in both food and taste. I didn't like any of them--not even the kim chi. For lunch, I had a lunch special bento box that had beef ribs, rice, an egg omelet/roll, pot stickers and a salad. Everything was average, none of it was tasty. Probably the best thing that I ate was the white rice. It was a pretty big disappointment considering how many reviews they had.  //Tip: The only thing I liked about this restaurant was that they provided their WIFI password on the wall of every table, which was really nice and useful.   Other than that, I say pass this restaurant over. There are better places.",

    "text": "Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ has grills where customers can roast specially prepared beef, pork and seafood at the table. Surrounded by a variety of fine restaurants from Vietnam, Thailand and noodle bars serving dim sum, Dae Jang Keum specializes in Korean styled BBQ that is served throughout the day for 24 hours. I brought my coworkers from the office. Everyone enjoyed the marinated short ribs that absorbed the hot and spice, sweet sauce the ribs were prepared in. My friends thought the dumpling soups were delicious. Plus the dishes were prepared with such grace. Each carrot shaped like a flower or sharp palm leaf. This was especially nice because one of my coworkers had never eaten Korean food before. Now he wants to return",

    "text": "Let me start this off by saying that this has been my go-to Korean BBQ restaurant since I moved to Vegas at the end of 2009. Normally the food is really good and the service is mediocre unless you are Korean (and mediocre is being generous).  Tonight, a group of us that work in the same kitchen on the strip went out together. We got there around 11pm and requested a table for 7-9 people as we weren't sure how many were showing up.  We were told it would be 15 minutes, as another part was almost finished and they needed to clean up, so we waited.  We were told our table was ready, and then no one showed us where it was. Being that it isn't a large restaurant, we found the table and sat down.  This is where it fell apart. We waited over 30 minutes to get menus, at which point I simply went to the front and asked for them. Shortly there after, our server showed up and her exact first words to us were \"Yeah what do you want?\"  We ordered 3 bbq dishes, japchae, 2 dumpling apps and she said \"this it?\" and then scolded us for not having the full 9 (we had 6).  20 minutes later she brought out our side dishes and yelled at us for not being squeezed to one end of the table.  We proceeded to adjust seating to try and lessen the load on her (we figured that was what might be upsetting her, having 3 of the 5 occupied tables in the restaurant).  She brought out our food, threw some meat on the grill and we never saw her for the next hour.  I cooked our food on the tabletop grill. I cut our meat, I served all of us the food that was cooked, and I even cleaned up and stacked the used dishes in the hopes she might notice and maybe take them, or refill our drinks.  Long after we had finished eating, she simply threw the check presenter onto the table and walked away.  4 of us fought over paying, all threw in cards, so I walked to the front and asked the split the $100 check four ways. She said no, said a few things in Korean that I wasn't able to understand (I do speak a bit), then told me she would only split in on two cards.   After this experience, I will more than likely not be going back to DJK, despite their galbi being excellent.  I've never in my life had such a bad experience with a server, and I've been working as a chef for over 15 years (and have caused my share of servers to leave in tears/had them screaming at me in the middle of the kitchen).",

The first time I ate here was for the bbq, the meat is low quality and the bean paste is not very good at all and the sides are not fresh. The second time I came here I ordered the dolsut bimbimbap which is usually one of my favorite dishes. It's not very good here and the egg was not fresh and sunny side up as it should be, instead it was cold and pre-cooked (wtf?). My boyfriend ordered the beef soondubu which was not spicy and had no beef in it what so ever (again wtf?). Both times I have come here the service has been extremely slow and they even ignore you more than the other tables if you are not Korean. The only upside to this restaurant is that if you're ever low on some chop sticks, it's free for the taking.",

Flavor was good, but I wasn't so thrilled about the entire onion that seemed to be in the soup  Pros: - In a city that's always going, it's not surprising that this restaurant is open 24/7.  - Staff was friendly - Little bit of everything on the menu  Cons: - While the food wasn't bad, there was nothing spectacular about the food. I've been here long ago for dinner, and again, while the BBQ meat wasn't bad, it wasn't outstanding either - In the morning the parking lot was empty, but I remember when I came for dinner, it was rather a nightmare to find parking so just be aware  Would I come again?

It was a quite lovely meal but not really what I would go to a place like that for. The service was great and the food was served in a timely manner. The restaurant itself is nice and clean with quite a few customers at the time. It was a nice lunch but it wasn't anything that would get me to return nor recommend it to anyone.",

DJK is one of Pats Finds and he has been going there for years . Pat rolls deep with an Entourage we rolled in to DJK with around 20 people.   They gave us the Private Room with 2 Large Tables with 2 BBQ Grills per Table . It was a Hungry Posse so 5 King Meal Packages , Seafood Pancake's and 4 Orders of Pork Belly  .  There were numerous bottles of Soju ordered and drunken lol.   Our Server was a little Overwhelmed and Spilled a Large Glass Of Water into my Lap . LMao it was a rude awakening to say the least.  But the Food was off the chain good - Beef , Ribeye steak, Bulogi  and Pork Belly grilled right at the Table by the Servers . We all had tongs to pull the Cooked Meat off the grill Yummy!!  All the Banchan you can eat. The Seafood Pancakes were Delicious !!!  Service was good except for the Water Spillage.  Thanks Pat and Marla for Dinner!!!

As a bonus for the night owls (and drunk owls), late night \"happy hour\" gets a 20% off discount.

I mean don't get me wrong the service was on point-- friendly and attentive.  The only thing that rubbed me wrong was the extra charges for the essentials side plates.  The salad was an additional charge, which at all KBBQ places include with meal.  The steamed egg was $5.00 that came in a small ttukbaegi (ceramic bowl).  I know some places may charge for this but it comes in a bigger size for cost.  No rice was offered.  If you wanted sliced garlic and peppers it would be an extra $1.00 charge.   You can only order three things at a time, which this wasn't an issue for us. It's understandable as this prevented the waste of food.   The quality of the meat was good.  No complaints there.  I think dining here once is good enough for us.",

I'd understand if maybe someone was having a bad day, but all the ones that brought us food threw it on the table. If you don't want to work there- QUIT.  I ended up giving a low degrading tip, and the lady had the nerve to say we need to tip them $10. You're freaking crazing if you think I'm giving you $10 for your poor service. I told her \"you're lucky I'm giving you anything!\"  She said we weren't even her table- so why the heck are you worried about the tip then? Low service- Low tip. That's how it is.

I probably would have never given this place a try, but my aunt and uncle came into town and wanted to eat here. So, obviously I let them order because they're OG Korean. We ordered the seafood pancake ( ) and the pork and kimchee stew ( ?) (it's not the individual one it's the 2 person minimum order one). Anyhow, BOTH WERE SO DELICIOUS (and I don't even like kimchee that much). The seafood pancake has lots of seafood and the pork in the stew is deliciously tender.   Whenever I crave Korean food, I'll go here and eat...even if it's a 2 person minimum THAT'S WHAT TO-GO BOXES ARE FOR STOP JUDGING ME!",

She came up to ask us if we're locals so she can give us the discount. They also give you a lot of ban chan dishes!  My favorite was this anchovy with peppers dish. Sounds gross but it was delicious. My bulgogi bento came with this egg appetizer, rice, salad, orange and Gyoza. The tofu soup came with rice and also the rice porridge made from the stone pot they cooked the rice in. Food was really good. The tofu soups had a lot of flavor.   My bulgogi was sweet and juicy. I liked this place because they were not stingy with the side dishes... It's my favorite thing about Korean food!  Besides soup, they also have an extensive albeit pricey a la cart bbq menu. Didn't get a change to try but maybe next time!",

They only gave us the bones with NO MEAT. Yes, you heard that right....They tried to serve us bones. After about 10 minutes of arguing and everyone pretending they don't speak English we threw in the towel and left and were out close to $100 and we were still starving and still couldn't believe that they would try and serve us bones with no meat.   After much conversation, we think it was intentional. We think they have two menus, one for tourists or non-Korean and one for local Koreans. We can't prove it but after being served bones we have no doubt that this place is in business to rip people off or maybe the owners are racist against people not of their nationality - I am Caucasian American and my friend is from the Philippines.

It took us 10 min to get seated, which did NOT make sense because there were only 4 other tables that were seated... Not just that but the guy that seated us was very dull with the welcoming which would normally not be such a big deal but this was definitely off putting after the unnecessary wait. Took 15 more minutes for us to have to ask for water and even then he didn't ask if we were ready to order either. After we placed our water order, (WATER which requires literally no preparation) we see him wandering off elsewhere to distribute food orders.  The lady that was serving there too who seemed to be the manager was rather rude and unaware of everything as well, not to us but to the table next to us. The cart she was rolling around with the food on it, she should gently park it to the side away from people dining in if not being used. Instead, she pushes the cart away assuming it would stop but it CRASHES into the other person! How could you not hear that sound and come over to apologize!? God forbid there was something hot on it and it burned her... Aside from that, that same guy was still taking forever so we just decided to skip out and go elsewhere. I mean, what was the point? We didn't even order anything yet.... Would DEFINITELY not recommend this place unless you're desperate for OK Korean food or unless you're literally the most patient person in the world.",

It's like comparing a hamburger from (DJK)Denny's to (Numerous LA Korean Restaurants) In-n-Out. Both are burgers, both have meat, buns, etc. But one has a very distinctive taste of being fresher, tastier, more personality i.e. Know what I mean? With that being said, DJK does have a happy hour, I think it's starts @ 11pm, I'm assuming it's to cater to the service industry folks out there. The dining room service is not too bad, it's kinda of everything you'd want, fast and courteous.  The food is really not too bad. Since I'm usually one of those Vegas locals who just happen to \"stumble\" in here every chance I get, I usually get the soon-tofu or bim-bim-bop, both the stone and regular. Every time I've gone there, everything from the ban chan and the dishes are very decent. Really no negatives, however I do wish they would have noodles after 9 pm.",

The banchan are decent, but not exactly enough to satisfy 4 people. Included sesame broccoli, kimchi, fermented cucumbers, mashed potatoes, salad, steamed egg, tofu bowl, bean sprouts.  We ordered the Jack combo (brisket, pork rib, beef short rib, beef, and we substituted the beef tendon for chicken). The meat was tough, the selection is poor, and nothing was marinated. I'd say the chicken was the best, which says a lot about a Korean BBQ place, as beef is supposed to be the most impressive.  Overall, this isn't what I'd consider good Korean BBQ. It's decent at best, but personally my worst.",

Usually with unmarinated bbq, the Korean restaurant would provide flavorful dipping sauces. The sauces this place provided was pretty bland. The side dishes were really tasty though. The portions are good and the place was clean. That's why it earned the 3rd star. It seems like only one waitress could understand english. The combo was for 3 people, yet it only came with 1 soju or 2 sodas. That didn't make sense to us, but we figured they wanted to force us to buy the 3rd drink. They charged $2 for a regular can of soda. The waitress would constantly come over and cut up our meat, even after we told her not to. (Yes, I do understand it's part of their customer service and that this is customary, but we don't like being babied.)  Overall, I would not eat here again. I'd rather save my money for a cheaper and better tasting Korean BBQ joint near home.",

The thing is that Korean people ( or people who have a great deal of experience in Korean food/ BBQ ) would probably not like this place very much. This place has different types of food, but my family ate bbq, so I can't judge the other things on the menu. Also, this restaurant had the type of bbq where you have raw meat and you grill it yourself on a huge grill in the center of the table.  I have to say that my family and I were very, very hungry when we came here, and would probably think any food was good. But, we have tried several Korean BBQ and this was one of our favorites. I don't live in this area so I probably won't visit this place again, but I would if I came back.  The service was a bit lagging, since all they were required to do was bring a few slabs of raw meat to our table.   We ordered a tofu- ribs combination (sorry I don't know names) and 2 plates of meat: more specifically beef. We ordered one plate of delicious marinated ( Korean style bbq) tender beef and one plate of beef ( Chagol something or other.)  My whole family unanimously agreed that both types of beef were delicious, but I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the marinated beef if you were to get one type of beef.   The waitresses/ waiters give you a bowl of rice in the beginning, and the tofu was delicious with that. Now, as I said before, we ordered a tofu- ribs combination. The ribs were fantastic, some of the best I've had. Trust me, I've had a lot of ribs ( Im a meat person).  Pretty high class, nice, modern decoration.  Hope you find this helpful!",

But he gave two thumbs up. I give it 2 thumbs as well.  The service was really good, too. We had enough refills of salad and other banchans. The waitresses and the restaurant owner kept asking us if we needed anything else.   The only bad thing about the restaurant is the location. We tried getting there by bus from lv strip. It took us a good half an hr to get there because of the lack of bus lines that go straight from the strip. But our trip was so worth it considering the taste and quality of the food and service!",

    "text": "While walking along the strip, a Korean sign kept flashing and changing before my eyes. What was that?  I could see that same sign from my room at the Monte Carlo and noticed it pointed down a quiet street, right next to Walgreens. I could barely make out the fading blue Dae Jang Keum sign but after searching for it on Yelp, I was excited to find a Korean restaurant nearby!  Yes, if you're Korean, than obviously you've tasted much better Korean restaurants but this is VEGAS! If you're craving Korean food in Vegas, this is the best you're going to get - without a car!  $16 (including tax and tip) for seafood soon dubu that was a bit diluted but otherwise, good. She didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it which was a bummer because it was a bit too mild for me, though my spicy level is pretty high.  Side dishes were good, which included some of my favorites: spicy cucumbers, pickled daikon and bean sprouts.  Side dishes also included sliced hot dogs - HUH?! I didn't even touch this. I don't think anyone did!  Menu was also Caucasian-Friendly and offered Salmon, Beef and Chicken Teriyaki for about $18-$20. Each came with a side salad, soup, lots of rice and the meat.  Service was good - they even asked my caucasian coworkers if they'd like a fork.  Place is open 24/7 which is awesome! I wish I could find one here.  Prices are obviously a bit inflated and pricey but I didn't expect anything otherwise. It's Vegas - everything is expensive!  I'd honestly go back to Dae Jang Keum if I ever stay on that end of the strip again :)",

She didnt check on us once or do anything a regular waitress would do. While leaving, she called us back into the store to ask us why didnt leave tip. When we explained to her that we didnt feel that she deserved tip. She got angry and told us to never come back and started cursing at us in korean. Ive never been so insulted in my life and i cant believe they have someone like her representing their restaurant.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came with some friends. It was late and the other places we had hoped to try [first Shuseki, then Ichiza] were closed, so we wandered down here and decided to give them a shot on a whim.   The boy and I opted for the Jack bbq platter for $60.95, which was a TON of food! Easily enough to feed 4 with all the side dishes. It came with a bubbling cauldron of soup & a cauldron of steamed eggs, as well as multiple kinds of meats and soju. We substituted a large sapporo for the soju. We shared another beer later and for the four of us, the bill ended up being less than $90. The amount of meat we were given was quite a huge portion, so they definitely weren't skimping! It came with a bowl of steamed rice and two different sauces, as well as bean paste, seasoned lettuce, cabbage kimchi, seaweed salad, radish kimchi, beansprouts & broccoli. The banchan tasted fresh enough when we arrived, despite it being after 2AM. The kimchi had good tang but didn't taste old, the bean sprouts were still crunchy, etc. The meat had good flavor, though the pieces of pork were almost entirely fat. I like undercooked bacon and enjoy a good piece of pork belly now and again, but it was too rich to have more than a few bites. There were occasional bone fragments left, so be aware. Overall a satisfying bit of meal and plenty of food for 2-4 people depending on the depth of your hunger.   A good selection of meats and a surprising little 24 hour restaurant in the same shopping center as Mr. Tofu & Pho Kim Long. There were korean gameshows blaring loudly in the background and most of the customers and staff were korean. A couple that came in after us departed long before we did. Our server didn't come by very often after she got the meat all on the grill. At first she was really attentive and cut up our meat for us, but when we were ready to leave it took quite a long time.   There's a wall near the door where they celebrity signatures and photos. Most of them are korean but Paris Hilton shares a spot on the wall, randomly enough. :}",

We all ordered the $14 combo which comes with your choice of tofu soup and an order of kalbi short ribs. I had the beef tofu soup and it was very yummy. The side dishes were also very tasty.

    "text": "When visiting Vegas for the xmas holiday, we decided it was time we experienced more than the Strip. Lets go to China Town !  Spring Mountain Road ! Wow, low slung (strip malls) see the irony? with hundreds of shops & restaurants. Chinese / Vietnamese / Korean / Japanese. WOW ! Its the Asian invasion of Vegas. Felt like we were explorers who discovered China (oooops I guess it is hard to \"discover\" since a lot of people live there, to digress even further:  there is a movement to change the record that Chinese merchant seaman discovered America many of hundreds of years before you know who sailed the ocean blue in 1492). Anyhoooo once my fingers hit the key board, they just keep going.   Chose the DJK cos:   1. they were busy but didn't have a long line   2. after a brief walk through (under the ruse to use the bathroom) it was very clean with powerful exhaust fans for the bbq smoke. Alert... not all tables have the bbq grill & fan, so if you are goin  to get the bbq fare, tell them !  3. greeter / sitter / cashier was nice & cheerful, I asked her if we needed to sign in, she responded I know the order and points to the two groups ahead of us....they are #1, and they are #2 and you are #3. Well we had 3 in our 'party' the other groups each had 4+ people. Low and Behold a table for 3 comes up. It was kinda like that old slot machine (since we are on the Vegas thing) where you win if 3 cherries land on the line....anyhooooo I point this out because the greeter then explains to the 2 other parties that a 3 person bbq table just came up and she would like to sit us there ! Wow, courtesy and class at a strip mall in China Town, not to say my expectation did not include those qualities, but at that moment I knew \"its goin to be good\".  The food at DJK:  Ordered the 3 person set bbq meal (I forget the name, but it was something like 3 queens), a variety of beef (including a sirloin steak) & marinated pork. I think it was $60 or $ 65. With steamed egg (kinda a egg thing like Japanese shawanmushi (sp?) = great,  tofu soup = great (really tasty not tooo salty), kimchi etc. etc. etc. One accompanyment that stood out was the marinated Daicon  (sp?) thin sliced with a delicated marinade - the best. Meat was tender & very fresh. For us tooo much for 3 people, had some of everything left over, and the wait person  asks if we would like to take it to go ? Hmmmm let me think, I am staying at ARIA with no utensils, no plates, and I am going to take bbq meat and aromatic kim chee into the room ? Ahhh no. It pained me to leave behind this great food.   The service at DJK:  Awesome. Attentive & considerate. My only comment would be is that they want to load of the bbq thing with a bunch of meat at once. I kinda had the feeling that it was a \"turn-over\" strategy, since this shortens the time, wouldn't want the diners to slowly and individually grill.... I can hear \"too much time, load grill up, go back stir it up\". I actually think they believe it is part of the good service thing. We did not feel rushed.  Why FIVE STARS?  Food and service deserve it, value tilts in favor of the guest.   P.S. went back a 2nd time ! got the 2 person meal, and it was perfect for 3 people.",

I went with Bulgogi ($21.95) , which came on a heated platter after I was served a large plate of salad leaf greens with a vinegar chili dressing, and 6 side dishes including potato salad, seaweed salad, spicy daikon, kimchee, and Age tofu slices,  The bulgogi was well marinated and served with grilled green and yellow onions, with sesame seeds and a little oil. Bowl of white rice and an OB beer completed the picture.  Dae Jang Keum is the name of a woman of 400 years ago who served the royal queen in Korea as a famous and inventive cook. It is also the name of the lead character in a Korean Soap Drama about the same woman. The restaurant decided to name itself after her.",

Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.  With no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.  About nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.  We soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.    Back in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.  I like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.    The BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)  Service - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a \"Huff!\" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, \"WTF?!\"  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.  Side note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.  Watch out for the first stall in the ladies' room 'cuz there's a huge puddle right in front and I think they might have a leakage problem per the previous yelper who mentioned the mess too.    Reverse happy hour is 11 pm to 7 am with local ID only and that means 20% off. (You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile above!)  I think they are related to Ginseng BBQ on Las Vegas Boulevard.    Total bill with tax and tip: $65.50 Total stars: 3.5",

I've been to a bunch of places in Chinatown, none of which I can remember their names...except for this one...and that's because it's my favorite!  Unless you are a Korean foodie or Korean yourself, I would suggest going with Korean friends, so they can order for you and cook the meat for you at the table. Each table comes with it's own \"stove\" of sorts, and you cook the meat and veggies on it. I usually get chicken, which they will cook in the kitchen for me, because they will spice and sauce it up just the way I like it!  You also get a bunch of appetizer dishes before your main course, this includes fish cakes (my personal fave), kimchi (spicy pickled veggies), seaweed, bean sprouts, etc etc. This place is also 24 hours, though I would never venture into Chinatown alone past 10 pm. :p  If it's your first time trying Korean bbq...go to this place!",

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas 10 years and have been to almost all of the Korean restaurants in Vegas, and for my taste, I prefer DJK the most. When I come with my family, we'll grill one of the combos - usually Jack and ask to substitute the pork belly with more brisket. It's a good portion and comparatively the same as the others in town except there are more side dishes. Hobak is good but it doesn't have all the sides we like and at DJK it comes with the bean paste stew and coddled steamed eggs. We also don't drink so we get sofa versus the soju. I'm Korean and grew up in Los Angeles so I'm looking for authentic Korean taste and DJK hits the spot. I'm here for lunch or dinner several times a month. Overall, they do well. It's easy. Also, it's one of the few places in Vegas where they make naengmyun from scratch. If you like the bibim naengmyun spicy, they do a great version, although I'm not a fan of the meat pieces in naengmyun.   Their kimchi is always ripe and starting Nov, they introduced new kimchi stew that's really good. I ask them to add rice cakes (dduk) to it. It's really tasty.  Over the years, I think they've gotten enough non-Korean speakers so their service has improved. Recently I noticed one of their serving staff doesn't speak Korean, so that was new.  Their main problem is that the facility has been around for 20 years or so, it's not shiny. But in terms of food, it's pretty good. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

The service was so bad and when we wanted to get our grill changed this one lady just sighed and when she was replacing it she coughed all over her hands which was so nasty! then everytime we wanted to order the people would give an attitude and sigh everytime and when they would drop it off at our table they would just throw it. then the worse part was when we were checking out and we left a smaller tip because of the horrible service and the lady wanted to tell her that we had to leave a high tip! like what the heck. and she was rude as hell when we told her no because of the bad service and she was hella running an attitude. SHE WAS LUCKY THAT I STILL LEFT A TIP! gratuity wasnt even included because we were only four. WORSE KOREAN BBQ PLACE EVER! if you guys want kbbq you can find one still cheap but still provide good service!",

I did arrive there at 4:46, but they already closed.   Anyways, I decided to try this place instead since it was at the same plaza. Pricing is quite a bit more. For a regular tofu soup it was about $12. I got the pork flavor with a level 8/10. The soup had no flavor and there wasn't even a spicy flavor. I was extremely disappointed since the soup tasted horrible and didn't satisfy my craving. Plus it was pricier.   The ban chan was pretty tasty. They had kimchi, kimchi radish, fish cake, broccoli amongst other things. However I would have rather had better tasting soup. It is to be expected, I guess since it is a Korean BBQ restaurant.   The service was pretty great. The gentleman check on me a few times. Granted there was only one other person dining.",

The selection on the veg and quality of the meat varies from place to place. The bi bim bop here is well balanced and has a lettuce added to the top at first I thought it was weird but after stirring  it up in the stone pot which is a must for a quality bap it works. As I write this review I kind of want to go back for another and at 16 bucks for a bi bim bop it's quite expensive as the dish goes but I suppose you get what you pay for.",

    "text": "Okay the only reason this place gets the extra star is because I've eaten here before and the food was decent.  I came here the first time after a night of raging and I was sooo hungry our group decided to go cray at kbbq. The food was good, we were drunk punks so my taste buds can't be too accurate but it was satisfying.  The second time I came here, I didn't even get to eat here, or step inside the restaurant. I came here again this past weekend after a weekend of drinking of course and we wanted to eat and Pho Kim Long line was pretty long and its chilly. We remember we came to this KBBQ place from last time and we decide to go see if theres a wait. They have pretty large windows so we're looking inside and there is literally like 3 tables there. So I'm getting hella happy like yay! we can eat here without a wait. We go up to the door, the lady doesn't even let us IN the restaurant. We tell her we want to eat, she just nods and mumbles something and PROCEEDS TO CLOSE THE DOOR AND LOCK IT IN OUR FACE.  what. the. hell. I swear I was not being a DAB, I was sober and cold and hungry. AND I CAN SEE PEOPLE EATING IN THERE. what the heck is going on??  we kept trying to think, wait why would she not let us in? we are all changed into our regular clothes, pants and jackets. But that can't even be the case because last time I ate here I was straight up in my rave clothes.   Needless to say I will NEVER EVER be going back here. I have never ever had such an experience with a restaurant where the employee closed the door and locked it IN OUR FACE.   The logic of her actions escape me, and I just really don't know why she would do such a thing.",

And if a place doesn't want to serve drunk patrons, they shouldn't be open at 3 AM.   My friend asked the waitress, \"I can't decide, what's good?\" \"Anything. It's all the same. Hurry up.\" What in the actual F. Seriously?  To top it off, the food is mediocre and incredibly expensive for small portions. Never. ever. coming. back.",

The tofu soup I wanted to originally go to was closed on Sunday so we settled for this place.    It was very slow and empty for a typical Sunday afternoon.  I guess everyone is still resting up after partying so hard?  Upon entering we were greeted and ushered to our table.  The restaurant is a decent size and looks like it could hold a lot of people.  The three of us all ordered seafood spicy tofu soup.    Just before the food came out I realized they did not ask me how spicy I wanted my soup.  I prayed they make it super spicy the way I like it.    Well, it was a big disappointment.  We all agreed the soup lacked flavor.  It was so bland and tasteless.  The seafood they put in there is a joke.  It was near nonexistent and the pieces were so tiny I barely tasted anything.    The service was good.  Our server was attentive and was kind enough to refill our banchan when asked, but never offered to refill our teas or water.  Of all the restaurants and food Las Vegas has to offer, I'll explore other restaurants and will most likely not return due to the fact that my stomach space is limited when I visit and would like to try out other places.",

    "text": "Mr. Tofu was closed for electrical issues and my family had already parked....so plan B we walked over here.  Everything was mediocre and disappointing with this restaurant.  This restaurant only has tables with the bbq grill in the center and parties of 7 are shoved into a little booth with a chair at the end.  They seriously need more table space if they are going to put out banchan and food items.  Due to the fact that the table was so crowded, a glass of water was knocked over.  The waiter...stood there and didn't offer assistance, no towel or additional napkins.  The box with the chopsticks was emtpy, we asked for chopsticks.  We had to ask a few times before chopsticks were brought over.  At one point we asked for additional napkins, and the waiter told us they were available on top of the counter and we could help ourselves!!!  Excuse me?! What did they hire you for? This last encounter with the waiter pretty much sums up the customer service at this place.    Onto the food, the banchan consists of kim chee, pickled cucumbers and radishes, bean sprounts, mashed potato, and broccoli.  Probably the lamest combo of banchan and the least tasty version I've ever seen.  I've had food court Korean with better banchan selection.  I was craving cold buckwheat noodles, since I was introduced to it at Soyo the week before.  However, this place obliterated my craving probably forever.  The noodles are thinner than the first version I had and clumpy.  The beef broth tasted like MSG water....it was altogether a horrible dish.  The galbi was overly sweet and didn't have a nice char on the outside.  The bimbimbap was just average.  The seafood pancake also was mushy and didn't have the crispy exterior that some places can achieve.  The sundubu is definitely not as good as Mr. Tofu....there's a reason why people pick this place as plan B.  Although Mr. Tofu has a much more limited menu, the prices for basic items like tofu soup, noodles, bimbimbap are probably $5 less over at Mr. Tofu.   For me this place will be plan Z...i.e I probably will never eat here again.",

The fried rice was bland and frankly, I was surprised they couldn't get such a simple dish correct. The hot pot was flavorful but was mainly vegetables instead of meat. A pot full of veggies certainly isn't worth $40--it's the meat that everyone is really going for.  2 stars. Expensive and not that tasty.",

I loved the service here, usually service at KBBQ restaurants is terrible, but not here. Even with few staff, they were really attentive and kind, and quick to take your orders. Our server was very kind to my parents who are older and don't really know how KBBQ works. This place was great, highly recommended!",

I went with 7 others and we ordered two queen orders (just missed the happy hour) and were able to all eat plenty and leave happy.   It's funny to see those who don't eat at places like this that often, who start to awkwardly put the menu down and say \"I'm not that hungry\" to leave after dinner with \"That was fricken awesome food, thanks for taking me!\" cause this place does that. EYE OPENING!.... the quality is great, meat and meat... onions?.... hmm... plus kimchee... yeah, that's a salad - I'm good for veggies here.   But like I said if you've never eaten here before, trust those that invited you, yes it looks expensive, yes they speak mostly Korean here, yes you're the only white person here..... ok well not all the time, but it was for us.... that go with the flow here and try everything.

    "text": "After five visits to DJK in the past month and half, we will not be returning again for a very long time. Perhaps never again at all.  The first visit was great. The service was okay and the food was delicious. We ordered daechang (large intestine) and traditional kalbi. The daechang was a treat due to its rarity, especially here in Vegas. It's slightly marinated, which is a nice touch and adds a slight sweetness to its rich, fatty flavor. We liked it so much that we returned four more times.  This is where the bad begins. The second visit was mostly okay but the daechang wasn't marinated properly and lacked flavor. If the dish wasn't prepared properly, the servers should have told us that it wasn't available. We could have ordered something else. Instead, they served it to us anyway. After they us served our food, we were forgotten and the food ended up getting a bit burnt. It was still edible and the place was fairly busy so we gave them a pass.   The third visit on, things get really bad. The servers burn our food AGAIN. We waited over 15 minutes for more rice, side dishes, and water. That's only after having to flag one down after being ignored for quite some time. This is at 11 PM, when less than 4 tables are being served and 4 servers are working. We had to ask for straws three times. Twice to our server who never procured them and a third time to someone who wasn't even serving our table who *eventually* brought them to us. We were annoyed, but just chalked it up to tired workers who had a long day.  The fourth and fifth visits just sucked. Why did we go two more times after a shaky third visit? Probably due to a combination of having too much faith in mankind and a hankering for marinated daechang that can't be found elsewhere in town. By now, the faith is gone and the craving for that sweet, fatty dish has all but withered up.   So long, DJK.",

    "text": "For our last meal together in Vegas, we decided on Korean BBQ. We were pretty excited / tired / hungry after dancing and partying all EDC weekend and also because we were all preparing to go to the airport in just a few hours.  We strolled into Dae Jang Keum and thought, hmmm it smells pretty good... and the pleasant experience went downhill from there. As we were deciding what to order, we wanted to order a smaller package (bbq for 3 and then 3 apps since there were 3 girls and 2 guys... typically Asian girls don't eat a lot either) for the bbq so we could order more sides and apps.  We weren't trying to be cheap, we just didn't want a bbq buffet at our table when we wanted to try some appetizers. Well, this didn't sit too well with the waitress... but also keep in mind we were heading to the airport shortly... who wants to smell like bbq on a 5 hour flight? Anyway, after ordering, whatever we asked for afterwards... like more tea, clean plate, utensils, whatever you name it, she would give us a dirty look and just  plopped it on our table. It was also uncomfortable to ask when the soju we ordered was coming.  Overall, the food was pretty decent. It was delicious and the price was alright. However, the side sizes were a little on the small side- most Korean restaurants will replenish these within reason  but like I mentioned earlier, she wasn't too thrilled about this. The food really did hit the spot, however the service was less than stellar.",

Wish they would give out fresh lettuce leaves. The spicy bean soup that came with it was awesome. The cold rice tea had a great flavor, but way too sweet.  According to what I heard Korean waitresses work more like a team and they believe that for them to keep interrupting you during your meal is rude, maybe that's why some find the service stand-offish.  My husband hated the place, he thought it was way overpriced for the food and service :(",

Hunnie Bunnie and I decided on DJK.  Sitting in the booths I really feel like I need a booster seat. The booths are SO low.  Hunnie Bunnie just wanted a bowl of noodles. I asked if they could replace the SARI (side of cold noodles) for UDON noodles instead since she won't eat much. They did not honor the request so I ordered the full portion, DOLSOT UDON, for her.  I decided on the DWAEJI SUNDUBU (spicy soft tofu stew with pork).  HB really enjoyed her udon noodles. I just picked out all the noodles for her into a smaller bowl and left all the other garnish in the big bowl.  My sundubu was decent. Spicy with small pieces of pork in it. I really prefer Mr. Tofu for all my soondubu needs though... I also find that the prices are a bit higher here than at other Korean restaurants. I probably wouldnt come back here unless I wanted one of the cold noodle dishes since I can't seem to find it at other spots - but definitely not just for soondubu or Korean BBQ.",

Such an interesting way to cook the meat at your table.  We loved getting the combos where you would usually get about 4 different cuts/types of meat, plus all of the different sides that come with it.  We NEVER left here disappointed, but we always left extremely full! We even got a free after dinner type of  beverage one of the times.....I can't remember the name of it....and I'm not sure I'd have it again but it was a great experience to try it.  I also loved how different days would get you slightly different side dishes, depending on what they were preparing for that day. Some side dishes i loved more than others obviously and was so happy when they were on the menu for that day.   I always loved the spicy tofu soup, and especially the bean sprouts and whatever they were marinated in.    Always had great service, never once in about the 6 or 7 times we've gone have we had a bad experience.   Well worth the money!",

But the thing that really pissed us off was when we left we put the tip under one of the side dishes so i guess it wasnt easy to see? but the lady who took our bill ran back to us and asked us \" where is the tip??\" WOW REALLY!? after u rushed us to finish our meals and get out you actually think you deserved tip? tip is privilege not a mandatory. seriously cant get over how bad the service is, it'll be a while before I go back or even go back at all unless they fix there services.",

Went with the King - which was an assortment of meat, onion, mushroom, the usual banchan, and some other extras I've never seen at a Korean restaurant before.

The two watching over our table did a very good job of asking if we were doing ok, and I guess we looked like noobs cause the lady ended up doing it for us. No matter, as I was too buzzed to be wanting to be playing grill master. I also learned some tips on cooking for the next time.  The array of banchan was great, and provided extra layers of flavor to the grilled meat. You can refill as much as you'd like.

Apart from that if you order a la carte the food also delicious especially Mul Naeng Myun,Bibim Naeng Myun and etc.  The down side is the price is a little bit high.  Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ is  worth a try. Great place to eat.hotly recommend.",

I've tried other places like tofu hut, honey pig, kang ho dong's korean bbq place in cali, Gen korean bbq, and one other place that closed down.. but Dae Jang Keum is my favorite!! Other places just can't compare!! My husband and I usually get the Love Special! And we usually change the beef flank to beef brisket, which is always so nice of them to do. My husband and I like that it comes with so many side dishes! My favorite is the steamed eggs it comes with and the soybean soup! It is delicious! The staff is really friendly!! Let's talk about the grill.. the grill had a nice nonstick surface!! I love how nice it cooks the food, but also that the grill doesn't burn and have to be changed out. We never have to have our grill changed out. Some people might think that's a little bit expensive to eat here... and yes other places might be a little bit cheaper, but for me, in my opinion, I am paying for the quality of food!! I love going to this place and will continue to go to this place!! My hubby agrees that this place is the best korean bbq place we've been to!",

It came with samgyupsal, chadul, and yangnyum gogi. Also came with egg casserole and dwenjang jjigae. It was absolutely wonderful, oh yeah it also comes with a bottle of soju and all of that just for around 45 dollars. Which isnt bad at all one order of samgyup in orlando is 20 and there is a minimum order of two which brings you to a total of 40...so WAY cheaper than Orlando.  The service was wonderful, since Orlando has such a small Korean community my husband and I asked the waitress about what Vegas has for a Korean community he really just wanted to know about the hwaro hwe (live sashimi). So she told us everything we needed to know and when the bill came she gave us a twenty dollar discount!! So our meal came out to about thirty dollars so what we would have paid we just left as tip for her.  I reallllly reccomend this place to everyone!! it is WORTH IT!!!!!!!!",

Service is usually pretty snappy, the food is good...obviously I've had better but for the price and in this location, I can't ask for too much more.  I usually opt for the L.A.(?) combo, which consists of sundubu and galbi.  Sometimes I've gotten the bibim nengmyun...either way I've been pretty satisfied with what I've ordered.",

She just put hot tea in tall plastic cups on the table and left. When she came back to take our order she just grunted. I said thank you each time she came to the table and she never once said anything to acknowledge it. I am half Korean so I even ordered in Korean but nothing. The server never came back to the table to check up on us. When we needed something we had to wave people down. They weren't even busy. We were the only ones there. When we paid the bill she didn't say thank you. She just handed the card back. I am never going back! The worst service!",

    "text": "Okay, so I'm from SoCal and you know what that means...LOTS of yummy Korean food to choose from. I have to say that this place rates right up there with the yummies of SoCal.  We were visiting Vegas for the weekend and hooked up with some cousins in town. They brought us here. I was very surprised by the amount of food that came...and kept coming. Not only is this place open 24 hours, you can order as many servings of the side dishes as you can shovel in your tummy! Oh and we didn't have to cook our own stuff either. Every few minutes, someone came by to check on the meat and turn it for us and then pile more on until we finished everything we ordered!! The meat was cooked just right and very full of flavor. As for the sides, I think we must have gone through 3 orders of the cucumber and the daikon and 5 or 6 orders of the fish cakes!!   The parking lot of this strip mall was very crowded and we had to park several store fronts away but the restaurant is family friendly (at least during dinner) so that's a plus. My preschooler loved the food and the staff didn't seem to mind that she dropped her fork a few times and we needed extra napkins (those with kids know how meal time can be). The restrooms were clean too. Another plus for someone with a bladder the size of a pea and a preschooler.  If you are in Vegas and you have a car it's definitely worth it to venture slightly off the Strip to visit DJK. And, since they're open 24 hours, you can come for a late night snack after the partying or gambling and then head back to the Strip with your gut replenished! Heck, it's probably even worth a cab ride!",

I like how they changed my cooking ring quite often. The only beer available is HAI, which is very weak considering Korean BBQ is a place to get your drink on.
