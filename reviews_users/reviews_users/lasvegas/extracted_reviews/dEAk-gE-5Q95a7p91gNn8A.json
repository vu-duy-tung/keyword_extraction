I have heard whispers of sushi Koma from a few people in town but never really thought to much about heading there as the few sushi places in my area are pretty decent ala Naka Sushi, and sometimes once you find a good sushi restaurant you don't like to stray to far as you might feel like your cheating on them with the new hot sexy thang that's just walked past.  Arriving at Koma we had some friends arrive   Earlier and grab a table as the line was out the door and waiting might not have been fun in the heat.  Grabbing a few beers to start with, we ordered the AYCE, as sampling the whole menu is always the challenge that never gets completed. Tuna Carpaccio to start off was legit and highly recommended. After blowing through quite a few rolls id also recommend the Elephant Roll as I think we got two orders it was that good.  Overall  Service: 4-5 Price: $$$ Food: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 Coming Back: oh yeah",

    "text": "Thank you Sushi Koma for putting me in food coma after my dinner.  AYCE fans come around - the deal at this joint is ~ $22/lunch and $26/dinner.  The seating here is very limited and the seating area is on the small side. I could literally reach over and pick up the food on my neighbor's plates IF I WANTED TO (just to give an idea on how small we're talking here).  Anyways.. They have a pretty good selection on their sushi. I'm pretty simple when it comes to sushi. I don't go for sashimi or nigri. I wish they gave more edamame in one serving. If you're a fan of baked/deep fried rolls PLEASE TRY THEIR VOLCANO ROLL. I liked their Pania Roll as well, but too much cream cheese for my liking =( My ONLY downfall is that their servers kept getting multiple orders missed up. They delivered our edamame to the table next to us along with our volcano roll.   I just wished this place was bigger - that would make all the difference. All in all, I'll be back whenever I get an AYCE sushi craving.",

Right when we sat down, the servers immediately got out orders and food was served within 10 minutes. We tasted a variety of appetizers such as tune carpaccio, seaweed salad, tostada, and miso soup - all the portions were great and delicious. The sushi however took the prize (as it should right?). The chef even gave us complementary fresh clams to start. You can tell all the ingredient were super fresh and made to order. I really appreciated the fact that things were not stuffed with rice.  Our favorite rolls were: Mountain and PB!!",

It's open tip 3AM, which is a huge, huge plus for me as a hungry college-goer! We need our after party snacks ;)   Ambiance: 3 - Small, but homey. Almost too small for my taste. Sitting at the bar is more roomy than chillin at the tiny table my party of 2 was seated! Fun, American music playlist though aha! I heard everything from 90's to alternative to punk rock.   Service: 4 - One thing about a small place, it means pretty quick service. I've deff been to slower sushi places! It only took about 10-15 minutes for all my orders to come out, and most everything was correct. They were also super attentive and really friendly and kind!!   Food: 4 - Food was yum! But nothing to write home about. Yet, I'd still go back! I did especially love the ahi tostadas, and fresh nigiri (all of it)--which I'm a huge fan of! Not the freshest fish I've had, but still pretty dang tasty. For specialty rolls, I'm addicted to soft shell crab, so my favorite rolls always include those. (Bank & Spider are my go-to's) For dessert, you can only have one! Sadly, they were out of green tea mochi :( But I made do with coffee.   Definitely interested in coming back to taste more nigiri during lunch--gotta save those bucks! Go try their 'small dishes'; it will definitely make you fall in love with fresh fish!",

The restaurant is small and especially when they stick you in the corner.   Not very many options, at least not when I compared it to my favorite place oshi sushi.   Three times they delivered other peoples rolls to our table and I here was asked if I wanted a refill on my drink.   I didn't like that the veggie rolls, calamari and shrimp tempura were all served with the same sauce. Made it seem bland and generic.   The only roll I really loved that oshi doesn't have is the kimmey roll. The asparagus was very fresh and I loved the crunch top. There's no way I'm coming back for one roll though.",

The bf and I each ordered a large Kirin Light ($8.50 each) and the AYCE. We had yellowtail, tuna , albacore, and snapper. Many many pieces and they were so good. The fish was so fresh. I liked that they did not put a bunch f rice under it. It was the perfect amount.  We ordered the Philly roll, rainbow, Jane, Catepillar, Spider, some steak roll and the sashimi roll. We ordered multiples of these rolls but I am not going to admit how many. =) They were all very good and very fresh.  The service was fast and they had a lot of people waiting on the small amount of tables they had. We only waited about 5 minutes in between orders. I highly recommend this lace if you want AYCE.

My order was only a small portion of the menu but easily would have cost me more than $26. I had some shrimp tempura, deep fried oysters, octopus nigiri, elephant roll, red bean ice screen, plus whatever else we shared and some specialty items the sushi chef made for us.  Overall the food was very good but because I didn't try more of the menu it's a 4 which is still very good in my book.  Next time I'm coming hungry.  Service was excellent. We came with a party of 7 and Sushi Freak accommodated us very well. There was no wait. They were on the spot with bringing all of our orders out quickly and correct, separating bills and taking our money.  They made specialty items just because and said we didn't have to finish them if we didn't like it.  Don't remember how long we were there but they didn't rush us.  They also treated us like their number ones from when we first arrived till we left, excellent first impression.  Definitely will be back.   The dining area is smaller but it doesn't feel crammed.",

Servers don't even return to your table and so quick to leave after they gave the food.  They are always in a hurry and walking around ignoring us. They won't even glance to our table when we need something even though they were a bunch of them there.   I think there are more people by the reception desk, standing and talking, than servers.

The staff was wonderful. They were friendly and prompt. But the food. What happened? We both were excited for the AYCE. I started with salmon Nigiri.  Ugh! It was mushy & warm. I struggled getting the 2nd piece down. The Tuna Carpaccio got our hopes up and the 1st & 2nd order satisfied.  But the rest of the meal tested our gag reflexes. The baked lasagna was covered in disgusting chunks of sour cream that overpowered all other flavors in the dish. The rice was a mushy lump. The baked scallops should have been called baked onions that I still taste this morning. There were a few tasty bits of scallop and mushroom but not before the onion dulled our senses. My wife then order the teriyaki chicken. Unlike my 2 prior visits, the chicken was fried! Were they kidding? We then had the egg rolls.  Oh the egg rolls. The nice deep crispy fried shell had us hopeful. The hope was dashed at the 1st bite.  The rolls were half filled with what looked like nothing more than day old cabbage. I asked 2 servers if there was meat in the egg rolls. One said there was chicken and the other said there was no meat! At this point our depression was firmly set.  We finished with green tea ice cream and a mango Mochi, which was the best part of the meal. We left a full 15% tip because we didn't want to punish the servers. The new restaurant decor was inviting; the \"new\" food disgusting. Maybe they lost the chef. Whatever it is, we will never go back.",

Anyway, I have said this before and will say it again. My favorite sushi restaurant is Sen of Japan. Haven't found anything better. However, I do like Sushi Koma. If I had to do AYCE, I wouldn't mind coming here.   Service is usually pretty good. Other than the time we went on Christmas Day, the servers are friendly and attentive. I have never seen the guys working the sushi bar talking to customers, but who knows if they even speak English very well. That would explain why we always have to order through our server and not directly with them? Even when you are sitting right in front of them? Christmas Day here was horrible. It was crowded and service was pretty slow, although it did look like they had enough staff working. Maybe they were just not used to a full house? They forgot about our order because everyone else was getting their sushi except for us. Even those that were seated after us. I think we waited over 30 minutes to get our first round of sushi. While we were patiently waiting, one of the servers noticed us and asked if we had already ordered. We told her \"yes, a long time ago.\" She went to the kitchen to let someone know. Finally, we got our food a while later.   As I mentioned, I can rarely eat more than 2 rolls (unless I didn't eat all day), but everything I tried so far has been good. My favorite is the SC7 roll: shrimp, cream cheese and avocado with spicy crab on top. The gyoza was also tasty and didn't seem like the frozen kind. I have ordered take out from here as well, and I must say that they pack everything very nicely in those to-go containers!  Overall not bad for AYCE sushi and the prices are reasonable.

I really enjoy their bulgogi hot plate. Definitely try it out.    Their nigiri is pretty good as well.   I would be returning to this sushi place, but I still enjoy Sushimon and Kaizen more.",

I have been to a lot of sushi places in Las Vegas and I've never been so disturbed as I was when I went to this restaurant if they don't have enough staff they should hire more people or more efficient people who know how to multi-task at least.  I got no refills. Some of the things I ordered never ended up coming. Over priced for mediocre quality sushi that wasn't fresh. My friend kept asking for water and the waiter kept ignoring her he was so busy try to up sale saki and shots to other members in our party he didn't have time to listen to things that are free like water. And I only got one napkin the whole time!!!! I was so angry but the time it was over I no longer wanted to tip but you know larger parties get the gratuity added in no matter how bad the service is. DIRTY PLATES STACKED UP TO OUR EYEBALLS ARE UNACCEPTABLE!",

This place is absolutely worth driving any length, consuming every calorie and cutting your night short to fall into (as the name of the place suggests) a Sushi Koma and sleeping happily ever after afterwards.  This place is FRESH. Everything from the fish, to the seafood, even the appetizers, is probably the best you're going to get in Vegas with an AYCE concept restaurant. You can also order A La Carte from the regular menu but let's face it, dining patrons here take advantage of trying every single delectable item this place has to offer.   If you're a nigiri feen like myself, definitely try every single nigiri on the menu to see what I'm talking about, freshness wise. The appetizer menu is amazing as well. The Brie & Grape Quesadilla is a must try and I always find myself ordering about three of these during every visit. It's interestingly good!  The service here is always on point as well. My beverage cup is never empty, my table is never piling with empty plates and my sushi orders arrive simultaneously so you can actually enjoy everything while it's fresh. If you happen to be sitting along the sushi bar and have a chance to talk with Moon (the owner and head chef) during your meal, let him know that Julie Tran says hi. I'm always a low key walking billboard for this place if I know you're craving sushi and wouldn't mind spending a little bit of my time informing you about how amazing this place is.",

We were sat right away and opted for AYCE, ordering round one once we received menus that were forgotten upon our arrival. We started with salmon, yellowtail, and super white tuna and chatted about life and work while waiting for our fish, though it appeared that nobody else was and were receiving theirs punctually.   Thinking service was pushed back due to the filling dining room, we stopped another server and ordered another round of uni, masago, and amaebi, requesting that the shrimp heads be fried, before round one touched down. Nope - these items came out almost as soon as we ordered it, so we stopped not one, but two servers, to inquire about the first couple of items. The servers assured us that it was \"on the way,\" but everything about the timing and operation just seemed out of whack. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to leave feeling like I was in a \"k\"oma (ugh, by the way, I hate replacing c-words with a \"k\"), or if the communication between the servers was comatose. Sorry, \"k\"omatose.   I do have to say, though, that the girls working the dining room are very personable, all things said. If any one of them has her own station, we certainly didn't see it - at any time we were able to place orders with anyone, and everyone came by to inquire about us and refill our beverages. A plus!",

    "text": "My regular 5-star go to spot as of late did me dirty with some old fish on their appetizer sashimi plate (I'm lookin' at you, Naka Sushi) so I decided to try out a new joint.  I think many past reviews have hit the highs and lows of this place right on the nose (don't you love yelp?)  PROS: --Sashimi roll appetizer: Highlight of the entire meal, outstanding --Fish was fresh; good salmon, yellowtail and red snapper --Seafood Tostada: Great flavor --Tuna carpaccio: Great! --Service: Excellent, fast and friendly waitress --Good use of the toasted garlic chips on a few dishes --Gyoza: Perfectly pan fried, so many other places steam it soggy. --Chef willing to make some stuff not on the menu per request, such as my California style salmon Nigiri (rice/salmon/avocado/lemon/jalapeno/garlic ponzu) --Open til 3am --Decent fish/rice ratio --They'll do half rolls if you ask (most places do these days)  CONS: --The music is a little bit in your face...I guess they are going for the hip vibe with house remixes of top 40 pop... --Though I'm a fan of garlic, in a couple plates they mistakenly used garlic ponzu when regular ponzu would have been called for. Had to have been a mistake as the after-taste didn't gel right with the fish.  --The lemon pieces over some nigiri were twice as thick as they should be. A little over-powering --Not too many choices for rolls, but I didn't walk out hungry   The place is the closest sushi joint to where I live and open til 3am...I walked out satisfied and I'll most likely be back.

It was delicious tho.  The tuna capa something was handed to us as well. Quite garlicky and delicious.. Altho  i wanted to save room for thing WE wanted to order they kept making us \"special dishes\" no complaints. I just wish i knew what it was so we could order it again! Well worth the money   Id say we had AT LEAST  6 rolls plus plum ice cream plus mochi !  Will def return it was delicious an the staff was real helpful with our choices of dishes!",

However, the nigiri came out with too much rice in my opinion.  The Washington, Cali, Denver, and Venice rolls were among the table's favorite.   They also served the uni last (even though I ordered it first) because it's expensive and they probably hoped that I was too full so I would cancel it...

The fish is consistently high quality, especially their salmon cuts (which is my overall barometer on the quality of a sushi place. If the salmon sucks, so will everything else). The fish to rice ratio is also good, so you're not getting a big lump of rice with barely any fish on it.  They have a good selection of rolls, with plenty of options to enjoy.  Their appetizers are a bit lacking in serving size, but the food itself is good.  Service is generally good here, especially when compared to other places where the service is usually pretty bad (I'll never understand why). A couple of times I got hit with the \"second order lack of service\" issue that tends to happen at AYCE places where they take forever to come back and get more orders, they'll take forever to get your second orders to you, or sometimes outright forget some or all of your orders. Every other time the servers have been attentive and gotten my food to me in a fairly prompt manner.  Prices are standard for an AYCE place (about $35 after tax, beverage, and tip).  An added bonus is they're open very late until 3AM.  My only real complaint is how amazingly small the place is. Its very difficult not to feel very cramped even when it's not that packed inside (though it usually is). Also it's small size means long waits if you don't get there at the right time.",

We got our drinks and ordered 4 rolls. Soon after everyone around us was getting their rolls which were ordered after us. Even the table next to us commented about how we didn't get our food yet. We were only slightly upset about the wait cause we were in a great mood. The manager arrived shortly after with some of our order and we were never lacking for service after that.  Very very loud atmosphere. We didn't mind that though. Also it was really warm in the restaurant. Our server let us know that she was training new people and we hardly ever saw her but were well taken care of by her trainees. Overall: $26 for AYCE dinner, fun atmosphere, eventual attentive staff, great sushi!! Didn't seem to have a time limit for orders. Open really late. My favorite roll was the Washington roll!",

The rice fell apart as soon as I dipped in in soy sauce, they didn't provide soy sauce dishes, the plates were clearly old, chipping and of very low cheap quality. I've eating here before they expanded and noticed that a lot had changed with the food I normally would order. The tuna carpaccio used to have much larger thick cuts, now it looked like the had taken the original size and cut it in half. The salmon sushi also used to come with lemon slices on top, not anymore.The ponzio roll used to have a good amount of sprouts and onion garnishing it and much more sauce, and the fish tasted old. Also the place was pretty dirty, crumbs and whatnot all over the floor. Lastly, I ordered a large amount of sushi, I did this because I wanted to take the rest home knowing I'd be hungry for it again later. I told the waiter I was ok paying for the food I'd be taking home with me. Then this lady comes over and asks me why I ordered so much, so I told her why, and again I was ok paying for it. She then tells me that next time I should only order the proper amount. I will not be returning, you would think that they would love to take my money since clearly they're cheap af, not go back and forth with me about food that I'm PAYING FOR. Go to naked fish down the street, it's WAY better.",

The wait was bearable, only about 10-15 mins, it was a packed house but all the servers were on top of their tables.   We were always catered to, servers were filling our drinks when empty, plates were being cleared when possible and orders were always taken with efficiency! My only issue was that the span between ordering and actually receiving your order was a hefty wait time.   I learned after order my second round of rolls that I might as well order everything I want at once because it was going to take a while because of how busy they were.   Other than the wait time between ordering and receiving your order I love the menu, the staff and quality of food! Our server was funny and made sure we had all our orders and if we were waiting a long time he would make sure we had our order within 2 minutes! Haha it was amazing!   I would definitely come back to try more rolls! My favorite roll of the night was the Venice roll! I couldn't tell you what's in it but it was delicious!",

I recently wanted to give them another shot because it was my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant & it's also less than 10 minutes from my house. I saw that they moved to a spot just across the parking lot from their old location & I was excited.  The new location is aesthetically pleasing & way bigger than the old spot. I love the modern feel to the place, however the food varied from bland to bad. The only orders placed that tasted good were the appetizers; cucumber salad, gyoza & vegetable tempura. Only 1 roll of the 9 we ordered was good, which was the Tiger roll. We ordered another one & not only did it not taste the same as the first time but the middle was freezing cold.   I'm so disappointed with the food at Sushi Koma now. I used to be a regular but I now have other AYCE restaurants that I'd rather drive farther for.",

We went around 1:30am witch was great because everything else was close. The food came out within seconds and tased great, the presentation was perfect . I couldn't ask for more, I had all you can eat so it came out to $58 witch I hope  paying $70 was ok. Price was fair and the atmosphere was settled, they had casual music playing and everything looked clean to the touch. Definitely coming back",

The sushi here is really good!! The costumer service was bad, well our server was. He was great at first until he brought in a roll that we don't remember ordering. We told him we didn't order that roll and he insisted that we did, I never recalled ordering a \"deep fried California roll\" and he rudely replied \"you ordered that\" and left our table. We don't want to argue so we just ate the roll even though we're almost done eating just so we won't be charged extra for not eating a whole roll that we didn't even order. Anyway, the server, it's too bad I can't remember his name, (Asian guy with glasses who looked like he's on his early 20s) probably asked to switch with another much nicer server (thank God) because since then, he never came back to our table.",

It started out great as we ordered Miso Soup and some sushi to start.  I ordered my favorite Seared Salmon with yum yum Sauce which they never put yum yum sauce as I specifically told the waitress.  Then next thing you know my brother spits out a few pieces of hard plastic which were in the Spicy Tuna he ordered which I also took a bite of.  Not any type of hard plastic should be in raw uncooked tuna but hey yum right?  It was confusing as we were talking to 3 diff people and wasn't sure who really was the manager was at the time.  Probably to try to avoid blame and try to diffuse the situation. As we decide to leave early because my brother lost his appetite we get an apology from who I think was the manager and she said she was sorry she cut the bag wrong and says it happens quite often? So we were offered to comp one of the AYCE dinner and charge my brother a SPICY TUNA INSTEAD?!?! What kind of insult is this?!?! I used to work in FOOD & BEVERAGE and FOOD SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS ALWAYS FIRST!!!!!    With this act alone I cannot eat here anymore.  You are better off looking for other CLEANER sushi options with better CUSTOMER SERVICE!",

The staff is all extremely friendly and give great service. Our server was very informative and very sweet.  All our food came out in a timely manner and all of it tasted great.  The AYCE is reasonably priced and is the best way to go. I love the fact the sushi is not over stuffed with crab mix and rice. Many sushi places pack too much rice into their rolls however Sushi Koma does not. They put the perfect amount of rice so you can enjoy the fish.  All their rolls are also a great size as well so they are easy to pick up and eat.  I would highly recommend the Bank Roll, Tropical Roll, and the Alex Munchie Roll.  Their Hand Rolls are also really good plus their nigiri A+!",

The waitress would bring out our one order of salmon. And then we would have to wait another 10 minutes for the next nigiri to come out.   I don't understand. They had two chefs working at the same time. We decided for a couple more sushi and a roll. Of course. They somehow forgot the roll.

From the outside, it appears just a teeny non-descript hole in the wall.  Inside feels markedly different.  Nicer, inviting, contemporary.  All You Can Eat brought out the voracious freak in me.  My eyes were WAY bigger than my stomach.  Under 30 bucks is a sweet price for AYCE quality sushi.  Sake, Ama Ebi, Maguro and Hamachi nigiri were the best orders of the meal.  Uni was also pretty good.  Well this *is* the desert, so you cannot expect something like that to remain spankin' fresh, all the way from whatever port it travels.  And I was told it is driven in from L.A.  Tekka Maki, Sashimi roll, Tuna carpaccio were fine.  For the money, should have just continued with nigiri.  Over-did it though with the Elephant, Ponzio and Spider rolls. *bleurggh*  Service was biased :-\\ not that warm and welcoming.. at least not to moi.  Let's just say, you'll get improved attentive-ness from waitresses, if you are a male lookin' eligible and seem to be makin' da paper.

But again, the sushi is good so if you have no problem waiting a while for your food you may have no issues. I, however started getting hangry (hungry-angry) so this place isn't for me. FOUR stars though!",

My past experience however was disappointing. My mom and i ordered 3 rolls total which took 30 minutes. A ridiculous amount of time for sushi to take. The waitress kept coming over and reassuring us that the food is about to come out meanwhile the couples on either side of us were already being served seconds and thirds. I felt that because we were not all you can eat customers we were not a priority. This was upsetting, and when we mentioned it to the server she just kept apologizing.",

This place is a bit smaller than most AYCE places, however the service is friendly and pretty fast!  We ordered a variety of specialty rolls, but you must get the sea urchin and sweet shrimp! (each limited to 1 per person) In addition, the salmon and yellowtail were both delicious. The super white tuna was also another memorable culinary treat!  For dessert, I highly recommend the plum wine ice cream! An absolute gem! Other dessert options are available such as green tea, mango, and vanilla mochi ice cream.",

    "text": "First things first...I went in with an open mind and an empty stomach...Noticing a lot of 5-Star reviews from a handful of Yelp friends, I began to think-Are we missing out on other AYCE joints? Is my usual spot slipping like they say it is? Is Sushi Koma that good? Only one way to find out....Go!  We sat down for dinner one evening and almost immediately received our drinks and complimentary Edamame. Right off the bat, I order the \"one per person\"items-Uni, Amaebi, Carpaccio, and Sashimi Roll. We also got the Brie and Grape Quesadilla. Quesadilla was good, but kinda skimpy on the brie and grape, Amaebi was plump and sweet, Sashimi Roll was good, and I liked the addition of the garlic chips on the carpaccio, but didn't care that it was swimming in the sauce. Uni didn't arrive.  Nigiri was up next. Salmon, Scallop and Hamachi were good. The Saba was exceptional and I killed about 6 orders alone. Still no Uni, so our waitress reminds the chef. We assume that the Uni is on its way and we go with a few rolls-Elephant, one with beef on top, and one with soft shell crab. Forgot the names, but overall, rolls were forgettable... The Elephant was okay, the beef roll was barely evident because the overkill on the green onion and eel sauce, and the texture on the soft shell crab was almost non existent from being fine chopped, I like to bite into the body, leg, or claw when I order anything with soft shell crab, know what I mean?   Our waitress was still surprised we didn't get our uni, and in Korean, she and the chef were going back and forth for an awkward moment, and after 5 minutes, our chef reassured us that the uni was coming...don't know what happened there, but maybe he was saving the best for last? Got to devour the 4 pieces of uni which were very sweet, and we ordered up dessert.  Only ONE item per person, so I went with Green Tea Ice Cream and Wifey went with Coffee Mochi. She liked my Ice cream better, because this Green Tea tasted more floral, from being made with a green tea extract, as opposed from it being made from green tea powder. Choose wisely people, you only get one choice here.  Service was awesome, food....just shy of me being a fan...it is what it is.. Moral of our visit? The Sushi isn't always greener on the other side!.....ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(52/100) \"Komatose\"",

    "text": "Sushi 'til you koma- obviously an AYCE sushi spot, open late (til 3AM), with fun staff and a variety of menu items. This is definitely a spot to go with a small group, share some dishes and have a fun time, which is exactly what I did one night with Cathey K and Neli T.   DRINKS: Like any fun sushi bar, there are plenty of drink specials. Try a sake sampler, they serve enough to share. The plum was my favorite. Ask about drink prices prior to ordering, they are not posted (glass, half bottle, and full bottle available). APPS: Fun mix of options, really liked the sushi tostada. The sashimi roll I was looking forward to was so tiny as to be doll-sized, and the tuna carpaccio was tasty but seemed overly seared to point that it was cooked. This dish was redeeed by the garlic chip garnish, which I really enjoy. For something a little different, they have a brie and grape quesadilla, which they serve with avocado slices. It was weird but somehow worked. NIGIRI: Octopus, uni, ikura, sweet shrimp, cajun albacore, and salmon were among the items we had. I like how the salmon already came with lemon slices, like I prefer, and the server asked if we wanted the fried heads for the shrimp.  They don't overdo it with the rice, happily. ROLLS: This section seems to be their forte. The Stephanie roll was easily one of the favorites at our table  (and not because it's named after me- it isn't), while others didn't stand out as much but were creative and large. Half rolls are available, as are hand rolls.  Our server was sweet and attentive, and dishes came out quickly despite how busy they were. Note that the seating is a bit limited, and gets packed on weekends, when lingering likely isn't as welcome- but there is no posted time limit.  Our sweet server was great about checking in on us and giving us ample time to converse and catch up, would request her next time but unfortunately I didn't catch her name.",

This is one thing I really care about when rating a place. Another thing that is great, especially if your having AYCE is the option of half orders. I always find many rolls I like but can't try them all due to the fact I can't finish everything.   So if you craving sushi, come here to get your sushi koma!",

The first male waiter lost virtually all our orders, giving us only 2 out of the 7 appetizers we ordered. The first quesadilla was even missing two slices. We also ordered a salmon nigiri and an uni nigiri, and received none. Another waiter told us uni was only on the dinner menu, which the first waiter neglected to point out, but salmon was still missing so we had to reorder it. It took thirty minutes before we asked the second waiter. We then ordered four nigiri sushis from the third waitress, and had to leave before the last two came due to the time wasted at the beginning, as well as the slow pace of operations even around the relatively free hour of 3 pm. Also, the sushi rolls did not come with wasabi, or the first waiter forgot.   It was a very unpleasant experience that the quality of the food did not really make up for. We ate/waited for about 2 hours before quitting in waiting for all our orders to come. My father got so upset that he said it made him hate sushi. We definitely are not going to ANY AYCE sushi after this messy experience.",

    "text": "This place is okay if you don't have any other dining options to choose from and you are desperately wanting sushi. My family did AYCE and was happy to know that you can order half rolls which affords you to try the many different rolls without getting full. We were excited to give this place a try. The restaurant is very small and can be a bit uncomfortable when it is full which it was when we were there. The service was shaky from the start probably because there was only 1 waitress to serve the whole dining room (small). She did greet us as well as the sushi chefs but we had to ask for menus and then we had to ask for plates and chopsticks after she served us our first couple rolls. Spotty service aside, we did enjoy the seafood tostada, baked mussels, tuna and salmon nigiri and tropicana and Big B rolls. The bank roll and spider roll were okay, I probably would've liked it better if the sauce wasn't so thick and sweet. Also, the bank roll didn't come topped with smelt egg like the menu described. The almost fire roll was also pretty good. I wanted to try the towering tuna poki but was told that they didn't have it. Halfway through our meal, we ordered teriyaki chicken (a la carte) and was told that we couldn't order anything chicken because they do not serve chicken at this time. Something about the owner and having problems with getting the okay.  Anyway, at this point, we were still waiting for the sashimi roll and miso soup which were one of  the first items we ordered when we sat down and another tropicana roll. We decided not to wait for these items, paid and left. Don't think we'll be back to eat here again. We are putting this in the books as been there, tried that, next! Still looking for a good sushi restaurant any where in town after our favorite AYCE Sin City Sushi went down hill a few months ago.",

    "text": "Sushi koma has really good fresh fish but their rolls are all kinda hard to choose since not a lot of them are that good to me. Maybe the best roll is the Vegas freak but it's not on the menu. My absolute fav though is the tuna carpaccio (MUST TRY) all you can eat for 2 people is about $55 and the customer service every time I've been has been really awesome! Friendly staff and they're always checking up on you to make sure you have everything you need. The only problem that I have is that they take too long to bring my food out like I'll order a ton of stuff all at the same time and then they'll Bring out like 5 things and then I'll finish those 5 things and then the waiting interval between when the next time my other rolls come out is such a long time. Like I'll find myself ordering more food during that interval not realizing I had a ton more stuff coming and ends up all coming out at the same time and me having to finish ALL THIS FOOD ugh hahaha that's the only issue I have. Other than that place looks clean, bathrooms clean, kinda small though but very friendly staff. Wait time is never long to be seated that's why I'd prefer here over than goyemon and if they do last call at 2:30 they extend it for you if you were seated at like 2:20 which I think is totally amazing that they love their customers  definitely coming back oh! And to add cafe Darak is just next door too so when you're done eating you can just walk next door to the most amazing cafe in the world (,:",

We never waited more than a few minutes for a table.   Their prices are decent and we usually do the \"all you can eat\". Some other places charge you if you leave to much uneaten. Not sure if these guys do, but we've never incurred extra charges.   Everything we're tried on the menu was great, except the terriaki chicken - it's way too sweet for my taste. But their rolls are great and their nagiri portions are great too - no skimping on the fish and filling it with a ton of rice. Tempura is excellent. Even their dessert rocks! We especially enjoyed the mocci balls. If you order ice cream, I recommend the red bean flavor. It sounds weird, but trust me, it was the best of all their flavors.   Definitely recommend this place and will definitely continue eating here!",

There was a nice crowd of people but they seemed really understaffed. The server was so sweet but was in such a rush every time she came to our table that she ended up misunderstanding my order.  My friend went with the all-you-can-eat special but I only ordered one roll and a seaweed salad. The portions were ridiculously small and I was extremely unimpressed with the sashimi roll from the appetizer list. I felt rushed to order it and that was her only recommendation when I asked about the possibility of any rice-less specialty rolls. When we were ready to pay she informed me that she had made a mistake with my order and the reason the portions were so small is because they were a-la-carte. She assumed I was doing the AYCE special like my friend. An honest mistake...I guess. The music that was playing was the best part of the whole experience.  I felt like I wasa eating sushi at a nightclub!  Overall though, I probably wouldn't come back here again.",

Then we saw that this joint opened and took over. I was very skeptical at first to try this place, but I am glad I did! :) if you liked Brian's beach, I believe they kept the same menu.  My bf and I are now frequent visitors of this place. They have stamp cards, which entices us to come back because once you get 10 stamps, you will win a grand prize of eating one free ayce meal! We tried pretty much everything on the menu and haven't been disapointed. Also, if you don't want to order a whole roll and want to attempt to try everything on the menu, ask them to do half rolls. Half rolls are 4 pieces, so you don't fill up so quickly on just one roll of 8 pieces,  The service is impeccable and the waitresses are incredibly friendly. They are always on it, from refilling your drinks, to making sure you get everything you order. The place is small, so if it gets crowded, be expected to wait.  I feel as if the service is great, the food taste that much better. Haha.",

Every new sushi place that I try, I always seem to order at least one hamachi item, because I think you can tell a lot about a restaurant by how hey serve their hamachi. Naturally, I ordered the hamachi nigiri.. And as soon as that yellowtail melted in my mouth, I knew I was at the right place!   Three orders each of salmon, hamachi, and eel nigiri.. Five (half sized, which I love!) specialty rolls.. One serving of seafood tostada (bomb diggity!).. One last minute order of dynamite.. And (here's the kicker) one order of plum wine ice cream--which I've been searching for FOREVER for--later, a Sushi Koma took over me!  See what I did there?  Not to mention the service was tops! They cleared the plates as soon as we were finished, and always made sure we had water in our glasses, food on our plates, and smiles on our faces ^-^  And AYCE $25.95 for dinner, you definitely get your money's worth!

Finished a workout at LVAC and needed a post workout meal since I didn't have any at home. And since my trainer said it's okay to eat rice after a hard workout, I thought \"Why the heck not?\"  Definitely recommend doing AYCE since most rolls start at $6 along with apps starting around $4-$5 I think.   The sushi was good as well as what was handed to me and two other diners as a special...and boy was it special!  Tuna belly! That I could've ate for days!  Perhaps it's a their twist on nigiri, but I don't think nigiri is suppose to be in a pool of sauce...still good though. The rice on the nigiri just fell apart, no big deal because I was hungry.   The mochi selection is more than most sushi places I've dined at.  The tea is really good as it has toasted brown rice that you may see floating in your tea, but don't freak out like I did thinking it was a bug...  The guys here are super chill and the atmosphere was pretty good too with up beat music.   Happy Eats!",

The teriyaki was soo sweet it seemed like they poured the whole bag of sugar on it. They put the teriyaki on top of the rice and the rice was soaked with the teriyaki sauce definitely going to get diabetes. Most of us only finished 1/4 of our order and lost our appetite.

    "text": "Came here twice already on the trips to Las Vegas, and each of the visits have been great and have surpassed my expectations. Both times I've gone, it was after a basketball tournament game and we came with an empty stomach and left happy.   Food: It's an all you can eat place where the dinner is $25.95 from 3PM-3AM. I've tried a little bit of everything, from the rolls to the nigiri. The freshness and quality of the fish is not bad for a city so far inland. One thing I enjoy is the gyoza and tempura. You would normally think an AYCE sushi place with have decent side appetizers, but Sushi Koma does! The gyoza taste almost homemade and the tempura is lightly battered and comes with a light dipping sauce. One of my favorite rolls is the spider roll. It has soft shell crab, crab meat and avocado topped with eel sauce. It is a simple roll, but taste really good with the soft shell crab. I like the crunch and texture to the roll as well. Included with the AYCE, each person gets a choice of a dessert, which ranges from mochi ice cream, to a scoop of ice cream.   Service: The waiters and waitresses are really friendly and they're always asking you if you'd like to order more. They are very patient, especially if your table isn't ready, or still trying to figure out what more to order.   Ambiance: Sushi Koma is a little loud and dark. It has more of a traditional Japanese feel, yet something about it makes it not as comfortable as I'd like to it be. Maybe the reason is because of how dark it is inside, or there are too man TVs where people can get easily distracted. This is one reason why I didn't give it 5-stars.   They charge you for the extra rice you leave, so make sure to eat everything and try not to order so many rolls because those come with lots of rice that'll make you full faster. I'll definitely be back because it's worth the price. Just order some uni and nigiri, and you'll make your meal worth it in the end. :)",

We ordered shrimp tempura and when she comes back saying anything else I told her just waiting on the shrimp tempura she's like ooh I thought you didn't want it. And to top it off I LOVE THE VOLCANO BAKE SUSHI but they burnt it. I honestly would want a refund. I will not be coming back ever again.

In the most part Vegas has great sushi places, americano-sushi and traditional sushi.. In all Vegas is well known for its diversity of plates and flavors but this is truly my first time going to a well endorsed restaurant in Vegas with sub par everything on the menu. Not one thing satisfied me or my companions palate. The rice was grossly made, more of it than necessary, anything brought was a Meli melo mix of bland, tasteless mess, warm deep fried items came out with some very cold bits. Honestly it Made me angry. Even the One Mochi you are allowed to get was gross and gritty.. Service was spotty, waited 30mn (no joke) before getting my next order in, someone joined our party sat 15mn with not a server to check on us. Ended up asking for the check, the same missing waitress asked me to confirm that the new guest did not partake to the all you can eat (I guess she forgot in the process that she did not indeed serve us). The tea was overly brewed and tasted like burnt grass. The teen pop music was too loud, the TV with sports on felt out of place. A complete miss for me...cannot believe I have to pay for this crap, i want my life back",

The next best part is that everything on their menu qualifies for AYCE and you don't have to order the whole roll, but a half roll is an option.   My favorites were the sweet shrimp nigiri with deep fried shrimp heads and the white tuna nigiri. Overall everything on their menu was good and the price was hard to beat!",

When you're going out for sushi you are expecting to spend money on this place is affordable relative to the standard sushi pricing.

But I really ate my words when I got to see it. Their new location looks.. well.. good! It's a lot more spacious and open, and already that makes me feel more comfortable. No more congested seating with tables vibrating at the fidgety legs of the nervous customer sitting 2 seats down from you.  Gone are the days of having to scoot your chairs up close to your table just so you avoid hitting the back end of the person's chair sitting behind you.  Man sitting? Yes please, full spread. There's room to share.  Don't mind my sloppy gesture or allow my disgusting habits to turn you away though, this place feels and looks a lot more clean and classy than its predecessor location. I really do enjoy the modern touch and more open sushi bar.  Quality is still the same, and pretty decently fresh. As always make sure you get the seared tuna carpaccio with the garlic chips. And a full order of their salmon belly nigiri.   This place is the spot for an enjoyable ayce experience.",

I usually go to another sushi spot but I love trying new things and a friend had recommended this spot to me so I was excited to try it. Worst bday dinner ever. First, it took 30 min after being seated to put in an order, and that's only because I stopped a waitress to ask her if I could order now. She said \"let me get your server\"... I waited another 10 min and the waiter didn't even come to my table. I had to stop him and ask him if I could order to FINALLY order. So the customer service was just terrible. But I decided to lighten up because the food was supposedly \"really good\" and I've been waiting all week to try it. The food tasted alright, nothing to rave or get excited about, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT MY MOTHER, GRANDMA, AND MYSELF GOT FOOD POISONING!! We were sick for 2 DAYS!! Which is such a shame, because I really was sooo incredibly excited to find a new good sushi place! And I really wouldn't even be writing this review if at the very least, the food was all it was hyped up to be, but not even that :( 1/10 would NEVER recommend",

I came here at around 2AM for a friend early bday celebration. Their services is so so amazing, everyone was so friendly and interactive with full knowledge of the menu and was available in case we had any questions. We walked in and was immediately seated right away and had our order taken too because we had what we wanted in mind already.   The staffs are ALL so happy and let out a good vibe (because if i worked at 2AM i would've been pissed so idk how theyre all in a super duper good mood!) All our food came out fairly fast and all was yummy! It's hard finding a sushi place that serves every single sushi roll so delicious and flavorful that you always crave more.  AYCE is $25.95 for dinner which is super reasonable! I usually order around 4-5 rolls, a bunch of apps & deserts or more anyways so it's a really good price!! There's soooo many options to choose from and their menu is huge i literally wanted to try every single roll. They are also very open to accommodate with your needs as well if you wanted to tweak some rolls up!   Their new location is super similar to their previous one except it's about 2x as bigger. Everything is super clean and they have such a relaxing dimmed environment with relaxing music!   The only complaint i have is that they only do one desert per person for AYCE because some other places allow unlimited (but it's understandable!) other than that i highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Praise to the late-night-food-run gods for blessing us unworthy Las Vegans with Sushi Koma.   I came across this hometown sushi joint two summers ago when my boyfriend, Matthew, and I were out and about, and my loyalty has been to SK ever since.   The boys behind the bar know exactly how to dish it out & if there isn't something on the menu that immediately catches your eye, never fear.. they'll send you uniquely made specials specifically tailored to meet your fav-fish preferences. Though all their food is worthy of its own rant, you have to, have to, HAVE TO try the seared tuna carpaccio. Thinly sliced seared tuna painted with yum-yum & ponzu and garnished with garlic chips & green onions. You've never had an orgasm like this one.   Sushi Koma is also one of the only sushi restaurants in Vegas that caters to vegetarians & vegans. So don't be afraid to ask about their green menu!  Aside from the food, you can always count on great service and a warm welcome from the owner, Chris. All the staff really make a genuine effort to not only make sure that you had a good meal, but to get to know you in some way or another. I guess that explains why they have so many regulars. The food was good, but it was the server who noticed that I died my hair & the chef that remembered that I don't like salmon that brought me back again and again.   SK, I never considered myself a \"regular\" anywhere until I met you. Thanks for being the best first love a girl could ask for.",

My boyfriend and I ended up wanting to lick the bowl after we were done.  THe Nigiri is worth coming here alone, the fish are thick cuts and small amount of rice. ( as it should be! ) I had two orders of Octopus and Smelt Roe, it was DELICIOUS!   The Elephant roll had the best sauce EVER. The spicy koma sauce is perfect. The Jane roll is great too. Wasn't a fan of the twist octopus roll due to the lemon in it but that was my fault for not reading the menu correctly. The service was FAST and top notch.  We had 3 different waiters making sure we always had food and water refills.   This and JJANGA are now my two favorite sushi spots in town.   The only thing I wish they could change is how cramped it is in there. Feels like you're eating on top of other people. Hopefully they can buy a bigger building someday..",

With most sushi places, I've been calling ahead of time to find out how their wait time is and when we arrived, there was exactly one table left for four.   The girls all have friendly and nice service. Very easy to ask them for anything since they all see very nice and approachable. They also interact with you a decent amount so it feels very personal, too. Again, very friendly!  They're known for adding sauces/toppings so you have to ask them not to put any on your nigiri. They also gave us two items (toro and giant clam) to try. They actually tasted pretty good. Usually, I'm worried about what they give us but tonight's was great.  The fish was decent but nothing really stood out. You can only have one item of dessert which is a bummer but at least, they have chocolate mochi. It's very rare for most places to carry chocolate so that's always a plus for me.",

The place smelled like a fish market, the kind of scent that slaps your nose right off your face! Had I been dining alone, I would've left. But my friends were already seated for lunch, so I ignored the smell and sat down with my party right away. I figured my friends already had the table, might as well give it a shot despite the unpleasant aroma. Maybe it was just that day, since I haven't seen other reviews make mention of this.  Our server was very attentive and made roll suggestions, since it was our first time here. She was on point with our drinks and kept checking on us throughout the meal. 3 stars for the staff!  The sushi was ok. I was disappointed for the most part. I love nigiri more than rolls, and thank goodness the fish tasted fresh enough, but I've had better quality AYCE elsewhere. Appetizers such as baked muscles and dynamite were barely satisfying, borderline bland. The rolls we ordered were decent, but nothing special. Perhaps my expectations for the food here was too high. I wouldn't mind trying it one more time.",

This place is small but worth it. Unless you got a big behind. I believe they tried to be authentic Japanese so they have smaller chairs and tables. Then again it's prob more to do with their square footage. The chefs are awesome. I almost said cooks. Whoops. No soup for me! So the fish are cut nicely and big. Rice is just right. It's my to go place. Whenever I want sushi I come here. You know they do sushi right when the sea urchin is served cold like the way it's supposed to!  Don't tell the better half but I think the waitresses here are super cute too. But then again I came for the food damn it! Uh and the service is a nice topping *wink wink*. The chefs are really chill and know how to slice. I even got a little extra order sample served to us just because. I am not sure if he knows we go every 3 weeks almost. But once a month for sure.  I don't like giving out 5 stars but I will give these guys a well deserved one. If they lack something they make it up with something else. I hope they don't become A holes like Sushimon can. They can make you wait for 3 hours, forget and never have a second thought to customers who have gone  to them for over 10 years. Glad I found a better place, and much closer too! I hope Sushimon chokes on their shrimp heads that they make so well. Semi joking but mad as heck still. 3 hours! I wouldn't wait for a Victoria's Secret model  to give me a kiss for 3 hours! Okay, I probably will but that's beside the point.",

    "text": "I could write a book about how bad our experience at Sushi Koma was, but I'll just hit the main points. It was lunchtime and I ordered a lunch special.  My wife ordered a few pieces of sushi, which they brought quickly. After the better part of half an hour my lunch special was nowhere in sight.  We flagged down our waitress and asked if the order was forgotten.  She went to the kitchen and came back promising that it was coming soon. This was lunchtime, and the order was a lunch special.  Why would it take half an hour to produce?  The \"chefs\" in the kitchen either forgot the order or were on a \"break\" or whatever. At this point my wife just wanted to get out of there and so did I.  I had completely lost my appetite.  We told the waitress to box everything up to take out. About 10 minutes later the lunch special arrived missing the four pieces of sushi which were supposed to be included. We complained again, and had to show the waitress the menu to prove that the order was supposed to include sushi.  She went to correct the mistake. After about another 10 minutes, a \"chef\" behind the counter glanced in my direction, put a container on the counter, and grunted rather rudely.  After a while I walked over and asked if that was for me.  He just grunted rudely again. When I finally did get the sushi, the pieces were very small; like child (toddler) size.  Maybe the \"chef\" wanted to punish me for complaining. My wife, who is Japanese, commented that the rice, which is the essence of sushi, was so substandard that she would expect better from a first day apprentice in Japan. The only upside of this was the waitress.  I didn't get her name, but she must have spent most of her free time at the tattoo shop next door, because most of her visible body was covered with tattoos.  This is not an issue, and she was very polite, attentive, and obviously working very hard to do the right thing.  In spite of everything that went wrong, I gave her a nice tip.",

And the mussels as appetizers and nothing but nigiri! Rolls are very good too. I'd have to say what does this place justice is the service we get. Everytime I visit the service has been impeccable and the servers always seem genuinely nice! They asked us about our tournament and even brought us ice for our poor knees! Refills were on point and food always came out in a timely manner. I would definitely always recommend this location. Heads up I heard the Uni tasted weird? I don't eat Uni so it didn't bug me.

If there is one thing I can rave about Sushi Koma(formerly known as Sushi Freak), it's the great service. The waitresses were consistent and quick to serve my friends and I. The chefs were also courteous as they checked up on us as well from time to time. Unfortunately, service may be their only fine asset.  The sushi itself, was terrible. First off, the rice was crispy and overcooked. It felt like I was eating rice krispies, with fish... The rolls were mediocre. Not worth the AYCE tag of $25. I'd rather go eat at a buffet, where I'm sure you'll find better tasting sushi and rolls even though they specialize in multiple types of foods. I'll make it short, you can get the same sushi at your local grocery stores. I drove 13 miles to waste money, appetite, and gas.  I have no hard feelings for this place. They just need to work on the quality of their sushi. Otherwise, they have probably the best service that I've experienced up to this point. But service itself does not make up for the lack of sushi quality. For you sushi fanatics, trust me, Koma is not worth the the trip. Don't expend all your resources and appetite like I did.",

Finally went with a friend whom is a sushi fanatic, and all about \"All you can eat\".    He ate to his hearts content, and barely came up for air.  I had to ask him after the meal what he thought? His response was \"Great!\" Everything tasted wonderful to him, and he said he didn't feel shorted or cheated on quality or execution.  I personally don't do the AYCE, as my appetite won't allow, but to have that come from a sushi foodie is huge.  Just one of the many reasons I've maintained Sushi Koma as an absolute gem of a restaurant.  Of course the service was good (As usual), even with several new faces. Efficient and quick, even though they were super busy that evening.  Go.... That's all I can say.",

And from someone who isn't a sushi snob at all, that's pretty crap-tastic.  My wife didn't like the sushi at all.  I think we're going to have to stick to Yama Sushi, Island Sushi, or Sushi Fever.  I had the SSS roll (shrimp lover type roll), some salmon and yellowtail nigiri, the octopus roll, and a couple other rolls.  The SSS roll had a strange texture, but it was alright.  You can't go wrong with nigiri.  It was fresh and delicious.  The octopus roll had lemon rind in it.  Really?  It kills all other flavors.  It really wasn't good...  Another thing I noticed was that they put the chipotle mayo and yum yum sauce on our rolls, even though those sauces weren't in descriptions.  Normally people probably don't care, but I'm not a big fan of either.  I prefer ponzu or nothing at all.  Also, the cream cheese tasted a bit off.  We didn't get sick at all, so it wasn't spoiled, but it just didn't have a good taste to it.  Sorry Sushi Freak.  For a bill, with tip, of over $70 for two people, I'm not freaking impressed.",

    "text": "Amazing sushi. There is a limit on some of the more expensive items - but for the AYCE price and quality of the fish, it seems totally reasonable. I only had items from the nigiri menu and everything was fresh and delicious. My favorite was probably the mackerel and the uni, but everything was outstanding.   The night I was there it was almost full and the dishes still came out pretty quickly -although I was seated at the bar, which helped. If you go for the nigiri, then plan on doing the AYCE as it will be cheaper than a la carte, and you'll want to try everything.",

Very friendly, efficient, young staff, including waitress and 2 young sushi chefs behind sushi bar -recommend sitting there as they like to surprise you with little sample rolls in between the orders. Apparently new mgt since 2/12 and they deserve notice-one of the friendliest AYCE sushi bar staff ever. Rolls were good, had a wide assortment-do the half rolls so you can try more. Only 4 stars as rice fell apart too easily, and pieces of fish in the rolls very tiny. But again....it's AYCE so I get it.",

I've dined here quite a few times and the thing I like most about it is their attention to detail in every roll.  I've gone to plenty of sushi places where the rolls look sloppy, rice is falling off, the avocado is brown, and the fish is slipping out of the roll; every time I have gone here and every roll I've had looks well prepared and tastes the same every time.  They are consistent in the great quality of the food.  The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because their service is extremely inconsistent.  The service is always pleasant but sometimes they are flat out freakin slow.  One time I left because other than moving me and my bf to another table, we were not acknowledged for 20 minutes!  Given that fact you gotta know I really love the food considering I'm STILL giving them 4 stars.  Tuna carpacchio (sp?) is a must.  Their spicy tuna has been unusually hot every time I've had it so I stay away from those rolls now.  My favorite rolls are the paradise roll, the stephanie roll, and SC7 (off the top of my head).",

Their old sign is still up and so are the restaurant hours on the front door. They really do need to change that soon. I almost didn't go in because Brian's Beach's hours on the door said they closed at 11pm but there was a neon \"OPEN\" sign at the front as well. Kinda confusing but anyways Sushi Freak doesn't close till 3am which is an hour after most sushi joints close. They also have the best customer service I've ever had before in a sushi restaurant. Their rolls aren't that bad either! I enjoyed the Venice roll and the Sam's Volcano roll. Yummy. Prices are pretty good too. They have AYCE with lunch costing $21 and dinner costing $26. Overall, I totally recommend it! It's sure worth it.",

After waiting and hour and seeing multiple people come in after us being seated before us, we found out people were calling in from home and getting on a \"wait list\" - not a reservation system, as they don't accept reservations.

Sushi aside, the real treat is in their appetizers! I think you only get one each in the AYCE price, but they have some sort of poki tower served on a fried crisp that was absolutely outstanding! It was cuts of sashimi tossed in a citrus/soy like sauce sitting on top of a fried crisp. Then it was topped with green onions and fried garlic slices. The garlic slices is what sent the dish over the top!  The sashimi roll was very good too!  Service was great! Strike up a conversation with the chefs. They are very friendly!  Its a bit of a haul from the strip, but if you are a visitor/tourist (like me), you can take the bus straight from the strip along flamingo (between Caesars and Bellagio) all the way out to Durango.  You can spend $35 for a crappy buffet on the strip, or you can catch the bus out to Sushi Freak for some pretty good AYCE sushi! Your choice!",

The restaurant is located in a neighborhood shopping center, where other storeowners had limited success.  The place is on the small side, and we entered at 11:30 to find ourselves the only ones there.  The menu was extensive, and the sushi was suprisingly fresh and tasty.  The rolls were good quality and were not drowned in sauce, so you were able to enjoy the taste of the fish.  The rice to fish ratio was well balanced.  When we left the restaurant two hours later the place was packed with customers.  I wouldn't call this restaurant the greatest sushi place I have eaten at, but the food was very good, and probably the best sushi that I have tasted on the west side of town.  I would definitely come back again.    This place is well worth a visit.  Try it... you'll like it.",

    "text": "SOOooooooo.. This sushi place was my favorite new yummy joint in Vegas my first time there. I figured it wouldn't be as good as the first time, every time. So, I tested it and waited to write a review after 4 visits. Sure enough I hoped it would be 5 stars every visit but it was not.   -FOOD: I order prety much everything when it comes to nigiri, except squid or octopus. Only because they use the low quality stuff and they dont spend hours rubbing for tenderness like it should be done. (haha that sounded odd). Anyways. Nigigri was a 5 star first time then it was 3 and 4 stars every visit after. The rolls are decent, nothing that actually says they are different from other sushi spots. Also my first time there they let me substitute a fish on my roll, and everytime after my first they denied me the same exact request. SO NOT COOL MAN! lol jk. butt really though, why did you guys get me hooked then cut off my request. GRR! Side dishes, are good, but nothing wow.   -MENU: Pretty awesome when they say everything on the menu is ayce, so u dont feel like you have to avoid a portion of the menu. They still limit on certain items like UNI and sweet shrimp.   -Service: Perfect, well as perfect as a place can get. I've been in the restaurant during busy hours and slow hours. They always serve me with a smile, everytime. They take my order very well, and have a great knowledge of the menu and items. Not too much with details of the rolls, but the server will ask the chef right away for an answer. No one repeats my order back to me to make sure they got it all, but I haven't not recieved my complete order yet so I'm very pleased. SOOOoooo, Service has once again added a star to the joint.   Me and some others tend to agree on this: If the food is mediocre, or right above decent. BUTT the service is just awesome. You will always get us to return. So thank to all the chefs, servers, and management.",

The only reason that they don't get a 5 star rating is that the service was slightly sub-par. There was only 1 waitress while we were there and the place was packed. We had to wait a bit too long for our orders or even to place another order, but for the price and quality, it was still worth the trek off of the strip.",

Normally the owner is present and the same staff which usually is the owner's wife/gf amongst others.   We went in on 12/26/2012 and instantly noticed a very fishy smell. The owner was not there and there was only one server that I think I had seen only once or twice before. The service was horrendously slow. Others walked out but we stayed.   When we finally got some nigiri it all tasted especially fishy. We did not get some of the things we ordered and finally just aksed for the check. The waitress KEPT apologizing to the point it was embarrassing for everyone. I cannot understand why they didn't call some help in. This waitress was clearly in over her head.   Today my girlfriend is home from work sick thanks to this sushi. I didn't know this is what they meant by Sushi Koma.  Despite going here literally 35+ times, we will not be back.",

The hand painted Japanese cherry blossoms add an authentic vibe. It's a small little joint so it felt like an obstacle course of trying not to touch people. The waitress asked if we were ready to order but asked for a few minutes. 10 minutes later and no one came by to check on us. We even had to catch one of them when they're trying to serve other people to get our order in. A couple that actually arrived 20 minutes later than us got their first order of sushi... Wtf?! The nigiri and appetizers came out quick so I thought it was going to get better. We mostly ordered nigiri because the boyfriend didn't want the coma from the carbs. You would think it would take a minute to make. Our final order of nigiri took 15 minutes. It took another 10 minutes to get our check. Countless of times the waitresses passed by and didn't bother to ask if we were doing okay or if we need anything. Even some of the sushi chefs were busy talking and looking behind the flat screen to make our food. I didn't even get dessert because it probably would take another hour. Sorry but it's not worth the $21 lunch.",

We had our seat, and there were LITERALLY two other customers inside. So there shouldn't have been a long waiting time. After we made our first order (Tuna Poke) we then had to wait 15 minutes to just get that. On the flip side, all the other guest are being serviced IMMEDIATELY. We first thought that maybe they had a big order, so we gave them the benefit of a doubt. Then afterwards more customers were coming in and ALL the chefs started making THEIR orders!     We soon noticed that the chef would take our order from the waitress, then place it to the side, and then start making orders for different guest that have been waiting a lot less time. For every one order we did get to the table (which weren't many), they would sling out 3 to four orders to the other customers. I wish I taken video of this....!!!! This was just a bad experience from the beginning to the end, the waitress didn't even acknowledge that we've been waiting a lot longer. Even when I politely asked about when the orders would be ready, all she said was, \"Soon!\" And then walked away. I didn't show any signs of being mad. We just paid our bill, and left....    And coming from the customer service industry, I am very lenient, I would happily pay more for good service, even if the food was not so great.",

Like seriously, the size of the nigiri and rolls were perfect-no awkward mouth stuffing and everything tastes amazingly good! I feel like the fish is very fresh because when I eat salmon or yellowtail at other places I sometimes get this icky after taste but nope, not at Koma. I usually don't order rolls when I do ayce, but this place really has some awesome rolls, like the fish paradise. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because they don't have oysters or a huge selection of appetizers/desserts, but that's okay bc I'll still be back when I was some bomb sushi. Also this is a pretty small place so be wary of wait times.",

Con: Food were so good but service was too slow.  We always had to call our servers when we needed something. They never showed up to us until we called them. It was not that busy and there were 2 servers.   We ordered some sushi together but it came out one by one so we had to keep stop eating. I wish everything came out together for same order.

Then, people were constantly picking up our empty plates, but no one was asking what else we wanted. Then, when someone finally came for our order another person would come by a minute later asking if we had another order. This happened multiple times throughout our night. The sushi definitely wasn't the worst we've had, but it wasn't the best either. The sushi lasagna was burnt which took away from the taste. Lastly, the dessert...I get that a lot of AYCE desserts are limited to one choice, here they only give you ONE mochi OR a single scoop of ice cream. The ice cream and mochi were both served in dipping cups, yes like salad dressing. Overall, we were pretty disappointed after being hyped up about this place. We will not be returning.",

Hubby and I went on a weekday late afternoon, glad we went on non peak hours because the restaurant itself is quite small, approximately 25 seatings.  Lunch is $22 dinnier is 27, however if you want sweet shrimps & uni (one order pp) then u gonna pay dinner price, same rule with almost every AYCE Jap in Vegas.  Service was awesome, our waiter took good care of us. We ordered quite a few appetizers from the kitchen; he told us the sashimi salad wasnt on AYCE menu, that's fine with us, but couple minutes later, the chef himself brought us the sashimi salad comp from the house! AWESOME!  Seared tuna carpaccio was good, i like the touch of the deep fried shallots laid on top of the seared tuna, the crunch...hmm... yum... wish the portion was bigger! haha!   Sashimi roll looked so pretty, immediately took many pics & instagram it.. lol... the fish was ok, very fresh, but the dressing/ sauce was overpowering the sashimi itself.  Seafood tostada is a layer of sashimi mixed with ponzu sauce, laid on top of a deep fried dumpling sheet/taco... a unique app from sushi Koma!   Seaweed salad was ok, very ordinary, nothing special  Shrimp tempura & calamari were really good! The batter was thin, fluffy and light weight! Served hot! Dipped into the tempera sauce, the juice, the crunch, the shrimp itself was fresh and perfectly cooked, so many good flavors in one bite!  We had soft shell crab handroll because soft shell crab must order as a roll, cant be ordered by itself.  But i will say the combination of little rice & seaweed, the soft shell crab actually tasted so much better!!   We finally moved to the entree section, haha, in general, all the nigiri were great, nothing to complain, fish was very fresh! And the presentation was very appealing as well!   Each AYCE in town has their specialties, Sushi Koma, i will definitely come back for your nigiri, capaccio, tostada,  and your mochi ice cream!   Unfortunately for grilled salmon kama and raw oysters, we have to go somewhere else, they aint on the menu.",

All the servers were attentive. We never had an empty glass, and our plates were being taken away promptly. All in all service was a 4/5 star service.....  But sadly you come to sushi for the sushi and that my friends was not on point this evening or the last handful of times we've been.   The salmon had a crunch to it that I can't even begin to explain. Yellowtail was disappointing. White tuna had a decent texture but just tasted mehhh... on a happy note though the angry edamame was gold!!!!! The sauce was amazing.  Not their best not at least by my standards but I'm sure I'll give them another go because I always do. Maybe next time will be better.",

Another girl was working with her so and unfortunately I didn't get to catch her name and she was super awesome as well. Checked up on me consistently and the food came out so fast. It started getting busy out of no where but they did not forget about me. Cleaned my plates on time and it was an amazing experience.   The food was A++++++ !!!! The fish and rice ratio was the best part, so much fish, the fish was so thick that I could only do one round and ordered a little bit after that. Please tip the chefs appropriately! They really make sure that the food comes out fast and you get the most out of your money.   In all I had a great experience, this is definitely going to be my new spot and hopefully you guys come to this place and experience the bliss I had tonight.",

We sat at the sushi bar and had the all you can eat lunch.   Bryan was our sushi chef and he was phenomenal!  He was personable, creative and extremely talented at making sushi.  He went out of his way to make our first time visit extremely amazing.   Besides the terrific service from everyone who works here, I need to mention how incredibly good the sushi was!   It was the freshest, most creative, delicious sushi I have found.    Thank you for a great dining experience,  we definitely will be back.   Our second visit to Sushi Koma was as good if not better then the first one.  I seriously love this place.  I would rather eat here then any place on the strip.   Service is amazing. We were blessed to have Bryan as our sushi chef again.   He once again spoiled us and treated us like vip's. The food is so ridiculously good. This place is such a hidden gem, this continues to be the only place I will go to sushi while I'm in Vegas.",

This is the THIRD time in a row that we dine in and our orders are completely messed up! We were given wrong items, then brought teriyaki chicken with no rice for my friends kid when we specifically asked for the rice 3 times. Only one person was brought a salad when 3 asked for one and when we kindly asked for our food they said it was coming and then returned a few minutes later to ask what we ordered. There's only 3 tables occupied at the time on a Saturday around 4:30pm. They really need BETTER MANAGEMENT!!!",

Koma opens at 1130am and runs all the way to 300am nightly.   What a great place. Thanks to David T. and Smitcha B. for this find. Yes, Sushi Koma is a few miles north of the strip, but it's worth the trip up for AYCE sushi.   Go for AYCE nigiri sushi (tuna/halibut/red snapper/yellowtail/salmon are my favs), specialty rolls and appetizers. Koma serves up fresh fish, yummy rolls, and has good service to boot. My only concern would be Koma's small establishment...I'm sure they have a long wait if you walk in during the busy hours. They don't have many seats and the tables may be a bit crammed for your liking.   YOU MUST TRY THE: BIG B Roll (tempura/crab roll wrapped with rare steak). The steak melts in your mouth.  A must stop for my Vegas trips!",

There was only 1 server for the beginning too so service was particularly slow.  For some reason, they've been out of desserts for a few days now. They didn't have the green tea cheesecake nor most of the mochi ice cream flavors. :-/   Food: Sushi was okay today. It wasn't as amazing as the past but still one of the best AYCE places I've been to. Another yelper said the quality has went down and I agree. It was definitely better a few months ago.

The service was great, our server checked in with us, and got our new orders for more sushi rolls (they can do half rolls, BTW). This was our exploring our new area/ celebrating Mother's Day lunch spot. And it was delicious. Hubby's faves were Japanese lasagne and Dynamite (both baked, so it takes some time). Kids meals are $9.99. Our son had the teriyaki chicken. He loves chicken.   Second visit, new location, Ste 126 & 127, for my birthday lunch (AYCE is a splurge for us). For many years, we went to Yama, and since coming here for Mother's Day, we are Sushi Koma fans! I love the way it is set up here, it's more comfortable. The restaurant can seat 70 guests. The front counter and sushi making station are at an angle, parallel to each other. So, the seating in the middle follows. And then on each side there is also seating bordering the walls. (Hoping that makes sense.) The single sex bathrooms are in the back (clean, also very nice, kept within the overall theme of the restaurant). The music is on point (remixes with great beats) and I love the blend of original unframed art pieces and positive messages. The furniture is dark wood. It is one of the nicest looking sushi bars in town.  The service was excellent, our main server, Janie (not sure about the spelling), was pretty attentive and even heated up our son's miso soup (that was very nice of her). It looked like there were five people working there total (the sushi makers were both Asian). We had miso soup, eggrolls, & edamame for our apps. Also had the Spicy Tuna, PB, Japanese Lasagne (baked), & Dynamite (also baked) to name a few. Delicious. And a nice way to celebrate my birthday. (Glad we discovered it.) I had the green tea ice cream, and my loves had the chocolate mochi. Mmm. I love this place.  There were five or six other parties there. On a thursday, for lunch, it's decent.   Yes, we'll be back, it's one of our favorites.",

    "text": "This was my first time here and I really enjoyed the food! The service was very prompt and attentive. Our server was very professional and polite. It is a part of shopping center but has plenty of free parking and very visible from the street.  They have a lunch all you can eat special for $21.95 for lunch and then $25.95 for dinner. You can also order by the roll but they range from $9 to $14, so if you're going to eat more than two rolls it may be a better deal just to do the unlimited. They also have a variety of different beers you can choose from (Sapparo was our choice), as well as wine and sake.  They have a huge selection of sushi to choose from. You can order as much as you want as long as you finish it. I was told by my friends that they will charge you a fee if you don't eat all your food.  I would definitely recommend this place and check it out if you're in Vegas!  I ordered a house salad because I like my veggies LOL. We had stuffed green mussels, calamari, teriyaki chicken, and fried oysters for appetizers. For our main courses, we had the Tiger roll, Volcano Roll, Japanese lLasagna Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Spider Roll and Scallop Roll. For dessert we had strawberry and mango Mochi and green tea ice cream.",

    "text": "I was very excited to come here, having seen 1k plus reviews. Have been to numerous sushi ayce and I wouldn't recommend this one to any one.  The food was average at best. The nigiri was the only thing that tasted fresh and decent. Every other roll I ate was very bland and unenjoyable. The rolls weren't wrapped properly and most of my pieces in every roll started to fall apart and I lifted them off the plate. The bakes ones were worse. They were over baked, and most of the rice would stick to the aluminum foil. The spicy rolls were far from spicy, mild at spiciest.   Don't know how most of the other praise the customer service, they were pleasant but slow. They brought us 2 rolls we didn't ask for and it wasn't even half full so I don't know how hard it was to keep track of about 6 tables with 3 servers. The rolls take a good time to come out on average of 15 minutes, may not seem like a lot for some but compared to places where they bring them in half the time, just brings disappointment. There were 4 sushi chefs and still took them a while. My second to last half roll took 30 minutes to come and my last one never showed up.  We were here about an hour and half and got refills once. They were quick to remove the plates but not ask if we needed refills. Other places just bring you the drinks when they see yours running low.   Also this place isn't family friendly like most sushi places. There no age restriction or limit so if you come with your 2 year old like us they will get charged 1/2 price for the 1-2 pieces they will eat. We were 4 adults, toddler and a baby and they automatically add 19% gratuity, wow. That's why they're service is slow and terrible because they will automatically tip themselves for they're shitty service if you bring your whole family.   Best advice is to go anywhere but here, but hey if you don't mind terrible service and sushi that rivals smiths prepackaged sushi by all means come here. I will not nor will I recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "Just went to this place and definitely would not recommend if you want quality fish! I can't even say the fish quality was half decent either. But I guess that's why its an all you can eat restaurant. So let's get started with the bad. Salmon nigiri had lemon slices on top to most likely mask the flavor of over due salmon. All you tasted was lemon rinds and lemon juice even after you removed the lemons off the salmon. I've never had salmon nigiri with lemons sitting on top of the salmon before and now I know why. Might as well just dip your salmon nigiri in lemonade and call it a day. The other nigiris (snapper, halibut etc) we tried had such strong flavors of some sort of ponzu/soy sauce on the top of the fish that that's all you tasted. No flavor of the natural fish at all. Literally tasted like drinking a bottle of ponzu sauce with a mouthful of rice. The red tuna nigiri tasted not so fresh either. I've had raw tuna plenty of times before and the tuna at this place was quite powerful in fish flavor. Maybe that's just how Vegas folks like their tuna, extra ripe in fish flavor. The uni nigiri was a hit or miss. I had one uni nigiri that tasted sweet and flavorful while the one right next to it that tasted like it came straight from a horse's ass. I should have known not to eat it when the color looked like green throw up compared to the first one that had a glowing yellow orange. The scallop nigiri wasn't much better. I've had scallops from the frozen aisle at Walmart taste fresher than the ones we had here. Maybe we went on a bad day or maybe that's just how they serve their nigiri. Definitely would not recommend nigiri at this place.   Now let's get to the better things about this place. Service was good. But that's probably because we went around 3-4PM. We were maybe the 4th or 5th table in there. Their cooked foods were much tastier than the nigiri. The sushi rolls were flavorful, the beef bulgolgi was wonderful and the complimentary tuna belly given to us was amazing. Probably the best item we had at the restaurant and it wasn't even in the menu! Their sushi rolls are quite large, so don't order too many at once or you might not be able to finish them. Their sushi toastada (however you spell it) was refreshing and decent. Much needed after the pink salmon lemonades we just had.   So in conclusion, on a scale of 1-10 on the quality of fish and nigiri, I would give it a 2/10. Their cooked foods, 7/10. Would I recommend this place based on sushi quality? Probably not. Better places with much better sushi. Service was good. Food, ehhhh. First and last time here! And word of advice to the sushi chefs, get those lemon slices off that salmon nigiri! I still can't get over it. Sheesh!",

Idk, there's better sushi places out there with a lot better tipping methods. If we would've know we definitely would've gone to a different restaurant with MORE roll/menu options.",

If the whole table agrees to go with the AYCE option, you will get the opportunity to try a great variety of sushi.  I was expecting to really like and really dislike much of what I was going to sample.  The only problem I ran into is that I actually liked everything I sampled.  This is only a problem because I was sort of hoping I could begin to figure out which kind of sushi I like most for those times that I might find myself at a place that isn't as good as Sushi Koma.  The service was superb as well, except for a glitch with their credit card scanner.  That probably was the credit card company's fault, though, so I wouldn't hold that against the restaurant.",

Every roll was fresh, tender and wonderful. Service was spot on except for the random Pinnacle roll that arrived at our table. We told our server we didn't order it but since it's AYCE, no harm, no foul.  Sushi Koma has great ambiance although it is small but it has a very vibrant hip atmosphere that isn't stuffy or pretentious at all. The servers were friendly and upbeat and kept asking if we needed more rolls. I think I finally gave up on my 22nd piece of nigiri...no more sushi. I truly achieved the level of a sushi coma with bottles of Saporo to round out my experience.  The tuna carpacchio was unique with some delightful toasted slivers of garlic that were crunchy and unexpected. I loved the spicy yellowtail roll. It was super fresh and spicy. The rolls came out quick and with great presentation. I did overhear the table next to us complain that they were charged extra because their toddler ate some yellowtail rolls. I wish I could get my kid to eat sushi....but that's another story. She did love the tempura ice cream that came with multicolored goldfish crackers on it.  We arrived around 5 p.m. and by 6 p.m. the place was packed and I saw people waiting outside. This is a great restaurant and obviously the word has gotten out to the locals.",

THE SERVICE WAS AWESOME, SUSHI CHEF TO SERVERS ALL FRIENDLY 5. The food was overall good 6. price is average about the same as any other AYCE sushi joint  The service was the best, it was better than the food. The food was good but not the best AYCE place I've been to. The service was the best of all the AYCE sushi places I've been to date. I tried most all nigiri, the fish to rice ratio pretty good. They do half rolls which is a plus so you can try a whole bunch. I didnt notice any signs saying a time limit which I appreciated. i came out with a food koma!!!   Its open till 3am which is awesome for you ate owls.",

Always very sincere and kind, and they are always going out of there way to make you visit fantastic.  There are alot of ayce sushi, each with special dishes and quality of fish.  I must say, Sushi Koma has some of the best and creative rolls, as well as some of the freshest fish in this area.  I like how there the sushi is always consistent as flavorful.  I have not had any bad pieces from my numerous visits.    The place is small, and most of the time it is always packed.  I love that it is open late into the night which is best for my friends and coworkers to grab a bite to eat after a long day of work.  Every time I have friends come visit, this is the place to go.  Great food, good prices, fantastic service and awesome environment.",

    "text": "I never realized how much I liked sushi until I moved to Las vegas where there was a plethora of ayce sushi spots. Sushi koma is my favorite spot and started coming here with my old roommates when I was living in South Summerlin, and I apologize for not giving them a review sooner. I never like to eat alone in restaurants but somehow I got the courage and came here pretty much every week (even sitting alone at the bar) because I need sushi at least once a week. It's a small spot so its usually busy but the owner mentioned its hard for them to expand so itll pretty much stay busy. Speaking of the owner, Chris, is a cool guy! He always says hi and remembers you and he's let me try a few specials before. The fish is always good, the service is great, and they serve different types of alcohol! Unlike some sushi spots only serve beer. Unfortunately I moved farther away where buying poke to go was more convenient to my schedule,  and then eventually I moved back to LA where I feel the ayce sushi game isn't as strong as LV, but I will def come back to visit and recommend as I usually take newbies to this spot when time comes around. Ill be back!",

Some items on the menu can only be ordered once, but that wasn't a big deal.  I got the Denver Roll, Sweet Shrimp, Big B Roll, Sams Volcano Roll, SSS Roll.  They were all pretty good I'm a great selector I think my favorites were Sams, and Big B.  I also did the flight of Saki for $10 which was descent next time I'd just get a plum wine instead of the rest of the flavors.   One thing I didn't like is there were no baby lobster rolls, and the tempura ice cream was just vanilla, I would have fathered green tea.  The waitress said it is usually strawberry. I will definitely come back.",

I had also called them about 15 minutes before we got there to have the bar open for two people and they had told me that it was first come first serve. Now last time we had a server who had told us it was completely fine and put the table on reservation. when I arrived we got seated straight away but was slightly upset because I saw that someone had reserved a table yet told me that was not possible and it was first come, first serve. now I love sushi coma but I was getting a bit irritated because I always go here. just a tad bit upset this time.",

    "text": "It was my first time here at Sushi Koma. I came here before back in the days when it was too be called Brain Beach Sushi. Always wanted too come check it out since on the way too the hockey rink Thursday nights. Generally only read positive reviews for it. I had friends visiting they heard about it so wanted too check it out. Never pass up chance for good sushi!   Since AYCE is so common here in Vegas its become harder too distinguish who would be da best of da best. I put Sushi Koma right up there in my top five. I feel like the quality of the fish was there from the nigiri, hand rolls, and speciality rolls. Dessert selection so solid nothing too creative but they make up for it with the appetizers. If there is anyway that I FEEL like distinguish one AYCE from another besides the OBVIOUS quality of the fish would be the apps and service. I feel like both they did wonderful job.  Apps we tried few of the things that our server recommended because when in doubt trust your server. She telling us most popular ones too. We couple of signature ones from the sashimi roll, seafood tostada, tuna carpaccio, and one odd for sushi restaurant brie and grape quesadilla. All of them was da bomb except for the tuna carpaccio. Me the fried garlic chips just not fan of. It tasted more burnt then fried and killed the taste of everything else. The rest have high praise not only for creative but tasted awesome. The sashimi roll love three or four different fish sliced thin all rolled up and came with nice sauce. Seafood tostada nice and refreshing nice chunks of fish and tomatoes in some kind of sauce. I love the fact with the fried tostada on the bottom use it as scoop of sorts. The cheese quesadilla in reality was much better then I expected. The Brie melted with some grape was great compliment too one another! The salmon skin rolls another one that stood out for me. The sushi was solid all around.  The service felt was fabulous. The minute walked in you could feel the enthusiasm not just from your normal greeting like every other sushi joint. Our server came over she asked if our first time. Great job telling us things that were popular and recommending. Couple dishes that hard time finish but never said anything about need too finish it. Warm smile and welcoming. Maybe cause smaller then most places and not very busy but still thought service more on it then more popular spots plus no waiting too seated. Sure if need fix sushi and normal spot is too packed come here.",

    "text": "My second time trying Sushi Koma's AYCE was quite disappointing. I had a variety of nigiri and all the fish except for the tuna seemed good to me. The  place was busy but the coziness of the place didn't allow for a lot of people. Even then, I had to wait for my food longer than what I'm accustomed to. But that was alright since I wasn't absolutely starving. What made the experience so bad? When my nigiri came, the rice was awful. I would describe it as cold and with the texture of week-old rice that one has left in their fridge. Every frickin bite was just extremely annoying. No matter how friendly the service and fresh the fish, I can never stand a sushi bar with bad rice. It was probably an off night since I've eaten here before. But man, something like rice should be kept consistent in any respectable Asian restaurant.",

The service was FANTASTIC, the hostess was super sweet and the waitress was very friendly and funny. Didn't mind at all how picky of an eater I was and even made helpf suggestions.

    "text": "This is by far one of the best AYCE Sushi's I've ever been to. It's becoming somewhat of a tradition now each time we visit Vegas for a tournament (We ate here just recently). Even an hour before dinner, I was able to make a reservation for a table of 13 - grant it our party came at a slower night when everyone had already left town. Their service is super friendly, very attentive, even for such a large party like ours. Everything is made to order, which I believe is so much better than buffet style. Everyone knows that made-to-order sushi tends to be higher in quality, but Sushi Koma kicks it up a notch, and they do pay close attention to taste, flavors, textures, quality of the fish, presentation and overall customer service. Or maybe I'm just a hungry fattie that wants to shut this place down for the night to inhale all the food.  They've got plenty of standard \"western\" rolls and then their signature rolls - all of which are great. (But I'm not a fan of tuna rolls in general.) They even have varieties to their spider rolls and volcano rolls - something I don't see often on menus. The sashimi - INCREDIBLY FRESH - Albacore, Cajun Albacore, White Tuna, Yellowtail, Uni (Santa Barbara), etc... all so buttery. I'm sad they didn't offer ankimo (monkfish liver).  If you've never tried Uni (sea urchin), I'd say go for it. People say it's the \"foie gras of the sea\", but I beg to differ as I consider ankimo to be the real \"foie gras of the sea\". Uni definitely has an acquired taste and has a very milky/bubbly flan-like texture when fresh. One of my friends in our group was being adventurous and doesn't really like seafood at all, but was willing to try raw fish, and then the uni. Being absolutely honest, I warned her that this is by far one of the most extreme flavors of seafood she will ever encounter, and after trying Uni, she'll be able to eat almost any other seafood, even raw. To my sadness, she didn't like it, but it was enjoyable to watch her reaction.  After hitting a wall, your mind tells you to eat more, but your stomach will deny you the satisfaction. So unfair. But leave a tiny bit of room for dessert as you can choose from green tea, red bean, vanilla ice cream, or their selection of mochi.  Sushi Koma definitely stands out from all the available sushi bars on the Las Vegas strip through the quality of their rolls and sushi. Yes, there's plenty of sushi bars to choose from in Vegas. And yes, this place is about 20 minutes from the strip. But if you ask me, it's absolutely worth the drive. For $25.99, it's way cheaper than the top buffets, and has better food quality IMO.  What makes it even better? Great company! The more the merrier = more dishes you can try. I'm glad this is a go-to spot for this group and I when we come to Vegas. Come hungry, eat happy, leave with a \"koma\".",

I remember not liking their specialty appetizers because they just didn't work for me.  But now they taste pretty good.  The tuna carpaccio is drowning in sauces and fried garlic that I don't taste any fish, but the sauce and garlic go very well together.  For their sashimi roll, I remember I didn't like it because it was pretty much piece of fish stuck inside a thick piece of radish. Now they slice the radish very thin so that it doesnt overpower the fish in their roll.  The changes they've made to their appetizers turned me into a fan of Sushi Koma.    Some rolls were a hit or miss.  My friends and I really liked the Kimmi and Big B roll.  We didn't enjoy the Fish Paradise or Pania roll. The nigiri was delicious!  The salmon had a \"fluffy, melts in your mouth\" consistency, as my friend puts it, and we couldn't stop ordering more.  And the rice:fish ratio was perfect!  The servers are really friendly and since the restaurant is really small (I think there were about 6 tables and the bar) it feels very intimate and it's not too loud.    *they have exotic flavored mochi like coffee and green tea!",

    "text": "For those who don't already know, I have been on a hunt for the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. While I still have a few more places to visit before my quest can officially become complete, I can say that this is by far the best AYCE sushi house I have gone to-date.   Telling from my experience as well as what other reviewers say, this place is always crowded with people. We sat in a small table in the center of the restaurant and we could definitely feel how busy all the waiters were getting orders around in a full house. Although there were so many customers, my date and I got out orders at a quick pace.   The waiters and waitresses were also the most welcoming and personal out of every restaurant I've encountered so far. When a dish was served, they would always wait to see my approval before going back into the question. Someone was always there whenever I had questions to ask, and they always constantly asked me if I ever needed anything or if the food was good.   Yes, the food was actually very good. As you may have already read, the fish to rice ratio was superb. The fish itself just screamed out FRESH, at least compared to other AYCE sushi joints. I was pleasantly surprised that they did half orders too. Not all sushi houses do that.   One thing that I thought was very unique and cool was the fact that they put lemon on top of the salmon nigiri as garnish. It gave the salmon so much more flavor, and a bit more of a zing to it. If I ever have a salmon craving, I'll probably go here to satisfy it.   I also liked that they had a wider array of flavored mochi ice cream. I always look for my favorite flavor, chocolate, but most places never seem to serve it either.  PS: They serve Tamago without the sticky rice! Pleasant surprise!",

Now you may be wondering why the 3 stars.    Well to me service is everything!  And the service here was...mediocre.  Everything took an extremely long time to get, and how they waited tables was different.  Every server waited on every table.  So we were asked 3 or 4 times if we have received specific orders.  (Because food was moving extremely slow) Gets a little much when you're trying to enjoy a meal.  Another downside is it seemed they put some sauce on almost everything, which had a strong vinegar taste.  Way to overbearing!",

We found Sushi Koma on yelp and seen that it looked pretty good and the reviews mirrored. The only thing that may be a burden to the establishment is the location, it is so hidden that most people would pass it by without even knowing. Luckily we found them on Yelp and Just plugged the location in. The sushi is very fresh with a decently sized selection and the staff is pretty quick and very friendly. Their menu was very graphically appealing and the color combinations really popped as well as the decor in their dining area. Definitely give this place a try.",

One of our cousins recommended this place and we decided to give it a go.   It's a SMALL restaurant. I can imagine on busier days for the wait to be significantly long with no where to sit and wouldn't be surprised if the max occupancy is 30 people. Larger groups would probably have to rent the entire space out lol.  They do have AYCE, for dinner it was $25+ My go to items are Garlic Tuna and Raw/Fresh Scallops and both items were way beyond what I was expecting, damn good.   Service was great, only complaint is that the servers need a better outlet or designated area for them to receive sushi orders. We sat at the bar and kept having to move so that the servers could reach the orders for the other patrons. It wasn't a big deal but sure was annoying.   New fav spot!",

Includes little sides like seaweed salad, edamame, and even 1 dessert per person.   I was afraid they would take forever to bring out rolls so that you'd be too full to order anymore but they were on it bringing  us our rolls and the service was so friendly.

We had a variety of seafood and each was fresh and beautifully presented. For a non seafood  entree, I recommend the Chicken Cutlet Special which includes miso soup, salad and rice. The breaded fried chicken was all white meat and was very juicy and tasty. After eating at Sushi Koma, I now have a new best favorite.",

My boyfriend and I always want to try new sushi places but we always end up going to Sushi Koma since we know that our money is gonna be well spent at this restaurant. Worth every penny!   I don't even know where to start but all the visits we've had here (maybe a hundred lol) were all superb. The food is AMAZING. The best part about this particular sushi place is not only the fresh fish but also how they ratio the rice and the fish. You don't have to worry about not finishing the rice because it has the perfect amount for the nigiri. This is really the most important factor to me lol!   Also, I love everyone that works here. They are all so accommodating and nice. Genuinely nice. They're more like friends than just people serving you your food. It's always nice to chat with them once in a while :)   To sum everything up, this place is BOMB. 5/5 stars, or even more that that!",

Fish is always moist and fresh, best sauces, angry edemame- the best and they apply a minimum amount of rice which is moist and fresh. Perfect. Everything on the menu is the best I've had except tempura veggies. The flavor is there, but I like to splurge and get a thicker batter. If you are health conscious then you find there's to be a thin batter which is perfect for you!! They have aced everything I've tried on the menu. As for there all you can eat... mind blowing at a great price!!! Sushi Koma is my first stop entering Vegas and my last stop on my way back to Cali. I just wish they'd sell me a t shirt.",

These past couple times going here haven't been good but today made me not want to come here anymore. When we got here and were seated it took them 10 minutes just to acknowledge us to get us some water and then took them another 20 minutes just for them to take our order. While we were waiting for someone to take our order every waitress that was working walked by us and looked at us and didn't want to help. Our server came to us once and didn't check back to us till we needed our check. We had to constantly ask them to see if we were going to get the stuff we ordered and when they did bring the food it wasn't the stuff we asked for. While we were waiting for our food to come there were people that came after us and were helped and got their food before we did which set me off because our waitress was the one helping them. The final thing that made me not want to come here anymore was when we asked for the check we waited another 15 minutes before I went to another waitress and asked for my check. This use to be my favorite sushi spot but after my last 3 times eating here I wouldn't recommend anymore.",

They check on you quite often to make sure you have enough food on the table and food ordered to be on the way to the table.    The uni here is really fresh and melt in your mouth.

My favorites are the strawberry and the green tea.  Sushi Koma is always fresh, but they do not offer sashimi.  Hikari is another AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas and they have AYCE sashimi, but the sushi there is not as fresh as Sushi Koma.  Can't win them all right.  You either eat the rice and get full faster or you eat fish that isn't as fresh, but still good.  Which do you prefer?  HAPPY KOMAING!!",

Hostess says, \"I don't know why it isn't ready.\" And the soup is ice cold from sitting on the counter for 20+ min. I can understand if the restaurant is busy, or if the staff is kind and apologetic. But a sassy attitude and non responsiveness doesn't work well. Warned the next customer that their to go order may take 40+ min. Time to switch restaurants.",

They used to cut the fish thin and perfect, now it's so thick, it's close to being inedible.   Last night, our most recent experience there, will def be our last. We were sitting in the middle of the room in one of the booths, and still being ignored. Every time we wanted to order something, we had to try to flag someone down, still being ignored. Once we finally got someone's attention, she placed her tray full of dirty dishes on our table and walked away and left it there... disgusting. When we were done, we sat for about 10-15 minutes while we tried to get someone's attention to order ice cream and our check. Lately it seems that they prefer quantity over quality, and it used to be the other way around. Very sad.",

My husband and I got there around 4 PM for dinner by the time we were done at 5:30, every table was taken.  That is the sign of a really good spot.  The starters like the sashimi, are pretty small in the all you can eat menu but totally worth it. The rolls are creative and delicious. And it's all you can eat so who cares if the plates are small you can just get more.  I also ordered the sake sampler. The strawberry sake tasted just like a smoothie. Next time I go back I would not get the sampler, I will just order the full-size glass of the strawberry sake.",

Finally we decided to flag someone down and ask about our order because our waitress was no were to be found. They said our rolls should be right out they were working on them. An hour for any food to come out is ridiculous considering the place was not busy at all maybe four or five other tables.  After receiving our sushi rolls I was not impressed with the quality of the food at all. The rolls were mostly rice and the rice was undercooked and fell apart. Will never go back to this place.",

    "text": "I seriously was gonna give this place a second chance but it failed again. It just reminded me of how not good their AYCE was and my first experience with them after many years. And my opinion remains the same.   Food: we ordered 3 orders of salmon, yellowtail and white tuna nigiri. As well as most of the one time order appetizers like the sashimi tostada, seared tuna and sashimi roll. First off, the app plates couldn't be any smaller. I thought they were serving it in toy kid plates. The sashimi roll and no flavor and was smaller than an Oreo. The tostada just tasted like pico de Gallo. And the seared tuna was actually good and flavorful but again, smaller than your usual sized appetizer. The salmon nigiri had a weird taste to it, even my boyfriend who loves his salmon didn't like it at all. I also had to spit out some kind of fish bone out of it. I've never experienced that. The white tuna was good and the yellowtail was good with the jalepeno on top. What I did notice was that their sushi rice wasn't done well because it would break so quick as soon as I tried to pick it up and would splash and soak in our soy sauce plate which is the most annoying. The shrimp tempura was not hot and crunchy like I like it. Although my boyfriend did like his gyoza. He liked it so much he ordered 2 orders. Also u can choose to have it steamed or pan fried. We got our steamed.  What I liked the most was the spicy tuna hand roll. That's pretty much it. Oh, I order uni and it was definitely not fresh because the taste was too fishy and slimy and I was told that uni shouldn't even really have that fishy fishy taste and that's how u know it's fresh. And after I ate it, my stomach definitely didn't react too well.   Service: I cannot explain how horrible the service was. We barely ordered anything and it took forever to get our nigiri. We ended up sitting at the bar and usually u can order with the sushi chef but NO, u can't order with them as we were told. There was so much orders being taken and made and I see everyone else with plates of sushi except for our table. We are usually patient but my boyfriend ended up asking for an update on our orders.   Ambience: cute place. Same plaza but different spot. Completely new and I guess bigger place.",

You can only get one of these though, whereas the other items are unlimited.  As far as rolls, I'm gonna go old school and say the tiger roll is my favorite.

A hard enough thing to accomplish right?!   A party of 3 (2 adults and a child), we walk into the restaurant at around 12 on a Sunday and the place is empty with the exception of two people at the bar. We all plan on ordering all you can eat until I hear my 9 year old will be charged full price ($21.95). $22 for a kid that won't eat more than a combined total of 1 roll and a few appetizers. He was disappointed because he was excited at the idea of being able to try different rolls that we ordered. What happened to kids pricing?!? There is no way my child can eat as much as I can.   So moving past this, he ordered off of the kids menu and we ordered two AYCE. The food we ordered came out immediately so no complaints there. Everything we ordered to begin with was delicious.   Tuna carpaccio - 5 stars Seaweed salad - 4 stars Green mussels - 5 stars Vegas Freak (a little on the heavy side but good) - 3 stars Dynamite - 4 stars A few different orders of sashimi. - all 5 stars  Teriyaki beef hand roll - 0 stars it was filled with mostly stringy fat, not meat. So gross!  Yum yum scallop hand roll - they brought me the wrong roll. Don't know what it was but it tasted like perfume. Disgusting!  Seafood tostada - 3 stars Elephant roll - 3 stars  As the restaurant began to fill, the orders began to slow down.... We get to the point where the restaurant is completely packed and there are only two servers and 3 sushi chefs. The servers were working their butts off running food and taking orders but the sushi chefs and the people in the back of the house handling anything needing to be fried or baked were painfully slow. To the point where we ordered 1 roll and waited over 30 minutes to get it. 30 minutes!!!! For a roll that was only 5 pieces!!!   My other issues with the place were that they pack you in like sardines. The place is the size of a shoe box and the tables are literally 4 inches apart. Too close and almost impossible to even walk around everything is so crammed.   Overall, I wanted to love this place. But not everything is ideal for everyone. I enjoyed the majority of the food, appreciated the mostly attentive server and loved the company but I don't think I'll be making my way back anytime soon. If you want better service, amazing food and a little more (barely) room to move around, try Yama!",

We ordered right away since we knew what we wanted. I ordered edamame and mussels, 30 minutes later and neither had arrived. The items from the sushi bar arrived very promptly after we ordered. We gave them the benefit of the doubt that the kitchen was just busy. Then, we saw the servers bring plate after plate of mussels and edamame out to tables that we knew were SEATED after us, so we know they ordered after us. We asked a server, she said she would check. About 15 minutes later, the edamame arrived. We had to request for our drinks to be refilled and had to constantly ask for them to check on EVERYTHING else we ordered beyond this time. We left after 2 HOURS and still no mussels, although they had brought out mussels to SEVERAL other tables. As my boyfriend was at the counter paying our tab, the server came up to him and said \"Sir your mussels are ready, do you still want them?\" Uhm, neither of us are at the table and we are signing our bill.... What do you think? The way the server handled the situation was also not to my liking because once she knew all of the problems we were having, she should have made sure everything else came out or comped one of our meals. I was disappointed because I know they have better servers. I've been there on a busy day with ONE server and she was GREAT! There were  2 or 3 servers on the floor when this happened.",

Free bottle of sake after 8pm on Wednesdays. Music is always fun. Rolls are absolutely delicious. Open late (3am). Ample parking (except for on Wed, when they have car shows). Quick and friendly service. Uni is better than Yama's (sorry, not sorry?).   What we ordered: To preface... Every roll we ordered was pretty light and refreshing, so it might be a bit biased. I've had too many bad experiences with too many cream cheese rolls, so I'm over it.   -Stephanie Roll -Kimmy Roll (definitely my fave of the bunch) -Ponzio roll -Tropicana Roll -Tuna carpaccio (always a must have, we even got 2 dishes this time) -Alex's Munchie (super spicy to me, but I'm not great with spicy) -Fish Paradise -Uni -Seaweed salad -Cajun albacore (slightly spicy)  Cons: No lighting in the front corner table.

    "text": "yum ! AYCE sushi in vegas !   Important things: - prices: dinner AYCE: $24.99 lunch AYCE: $21.99 - super small restaurant so if you have a big party be sure to call ahead 20-30 mins ahead of time to see if they can accommodate you - about 15-20 mins away from the strip - lots of parking, big lot in front  Came to try this place out when visiting Vegas after a friend recommended it and it was so worth it!! The ambiance is really cute with japanese decorations. There is a sushi bar and the service is great! Another great thing is that they're open late, they close at around 3am everyday.   We came with a party of 7 which was great because we could all try almost all the rolls, we just ate one of each. We seriously tried almost 20 different rolls and they were all really good! The sashimi is all fresh and they don't pack on the rice like some places do to fill you up. My personal favorite was the tuna carpaccio, you're only allowed to order one per person but it was SOO yummy! The rolls are pretty pricy if you are not eating AYCE so if you are eating AYCE then it is definitely worth it!   Some of our favorite rolls: - volcano roll - tuna carpaccio - B-roll  - fried oysters   Overall, super yummy! Definitely will be back if we are in vegas. Great place to go late at night and AYCE is definitely worth it! When in vegas, definitely check it out!",

There was a ten to fifteen minutes wait for our food to come (per order) this is including soy beans. Most everything we tried was not very good and wasn't the freshest. Maybe we went at a bad time. I was very disappointed seeing how they had 4 stars",

    "text": "Just moved to this area and this place is literally right across from my place. I always go to sushi mon for AYCE but this place has a higher rating on yelp and it's a lot closer to my place. Came here with my girlfriend at around 10pm last Friday. Its not timed either unlike sushi mon.  AYCE dinner is $25.95 with an order of amaebi and uni. The amaebi is so fresh! Love it! Also tried their Kobe beef sushi, sashimi roll and seared tuna. Yum yum. All the staff are very attentive. They came check us every 5-10 min to see if we need anything and they always refill our cup! They also recommended us many good items on the menu...the best thing is they didn't omit any orders. All of our orders came quickly. Also, half rolls are available too:)  Came back three days later with my bf around 11pm! He liked this place as well. Staffs are hospitable, even the sushi chef are friendly! This place opens till 3am!!! Didn't get AYCE this time because we are too full for it. Just crave for some sushi rolls after bowling! We ordered two rolls to share, one Philly roll and one volcano rolls :) they are about 11-12$. They also have a separate a la carte menu like sashimi dinner set etc.   AYCE is highly recommended!!:) love this place! Probably wont go back to sushi mon when there's a closer, better AYCE sushi place with no lines :)",

    "text": "I'm a fan of AYCE.  I'm also a fan of Sushi.  Like pallet-loads of it.  And, ultimately, I'm an avid fan of a good price.  So, trying Sushi Koma was a natural fit.  It's off-Strip, but we usually have a car whilst in Vegas, and one can always cab it.  Here's the breakdown:  PROS: _Lots of parking _Uber friendly Chef staff and servers.  Hi-five small businesses! _Bold (and successful) attempts at modern takes on appetizers: case in point-the Brie Grape Quesadilla.  It was a unique stab at the standard boring cheese quesadilla and I appreciate when Chefs take risks! _Tuna Carpaccio A++++  I mean, SO fricken' good!   _Seafood Tostada A+++++ The flavors in this dish is uh-mazeballs.  I mean, SO good that I just wanted to slow down time, so I can savor it.  I guess I could have chewed slower, instead of shoveling it down my face.... _Open til 3AM, so one can opt for AYCE after working on dance fitness! _Right between 4-6PM seem pretty open, so if you don't like crowds, this is likely an ideal time  CONS: _Certain foods have limits (e.g. both A++++ rated items listed above).  _Sometimes AYCE can be overwhelming.  For the untrained belly.  SO, for AYCE pros, it ain't no thang.  I will definitely keep this on my must-eat list for my multiple trips to Vegas/a year!",

In spite of the fact that Sushi Freak does not offer oyster shooters (my favorite), what Freak offers is pretty freaking awesome. Pun totally intended. hehe.  The sushi was very fresh and service was awesome.  Could be because the restaurant was the size of my closet, but my closet is pretty bomb and I was still impressed at how attentive everyone was.  We had a few different rolls and everything was amazing.  What can I say?  We like white people sushi and only occasionally order nigiri.  Everyone around us was eating the nigiri though and it looked fabulous. The definite way to get your $$ worth.  Take my advice, order the tuna carpaccio.  Just make sure your date has some so you both taste like garlic.",

I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, the service was beyond efficient. The sushi chef recommended some nigiri and came through with some amazing selections. I tried the following: scallop, salmon, white tuna, ahi tuna, and cajun albacore. Every bite of the nigiri was delicate, fresh and savory. I ordered a couple of rolls which were executed perfectly: volcano roll and a spicy crab hand roll. The sides I ordered were: dynamite, shrimp tempura and green mussels. Everything was delicious. I was amazed at how wonderful every bite of food was.",

We had to wait 20 minutes for a table. I was worried the service was going to suck, but we were very pleasantly surprised that it did not.   We did AYCE, which is $25.95 for dinner. It includes a shit-ton of stuff and I can't even begin to describe all that we ate because we went to town. I will say though, that the items that they allow only 1 order per person are bomb. I can understand why those are limited.  We got a ton of nigiri, and the fish to rice ratio is perfect. The fish tastes fresh and is cut nicely, unlike some other AYCE where the fish is completely butchered by some amateur chef with a butter knife in the back. A lot of their items, including nigiri, come with sauce, which seems to be a Vegas thing and I hate it!, but we requested no sauce and it was fine.  Overall a great experience and will be one of our go-tos for AYCE sushi.",

Very small (I'd say it can fit maybe 25 to 30 people maximum), but so cosy and friendly, you don't want it to be bigger. The decor is simple yet very appropriated. Some big cherry trees painted on a black wall. Bamboo blinds. Wooden tables. I immediately fell under the spell of our charming host (sorry, I haven't had a chance to ask for her name...), with her customized Sushi Koma shirt (she confessed she did it herself one night after a couple of drinks! Haha). Very friendly and client-oriented staff. Me and my friend had the All-You-Can-Eat dinner. They have great suggestions, their uni is definitely worth it, and they have unusual rolls too (the Ninja Roll is a killer!). And the spicy edamame is... greatly spicy. AND they have real wasabi for a little extra, which makes all the difference! You can order half rolls, so you can taste more. And the service is pretty quick. I will definitely go back (maybe next time I'll have a chance to get the host's name), and highly recommend it!",

Uni sushi was crunchy, they forgot to defrost the ice. House salad was covered in dressing, I couldn't taste any greens. I thought, there's no way they will mess up my ice cream, right? My green tea ice cream tastes nothing like green tea, it had a bubble gum flavor. These were the main complaints, I haven't mentioned about other dishes. Yucky food!  Service: They were friendly, but were very disorganized. They took my orders, but forgot to bring food out; I waited for one of my dishes for 30 min, when I asked them, they told me they didn't have the ingredients today, then why didn't u tell me when I placed my order and had me waited the whole time? Also, I had to beg for refill of my tea. The waiters were just running around like crazy. They had 8 tables and 5 waiters, come on. Another table got up and left.   First time there, and will be my last time. If you want all you can eat sushi. \"Doh\" sushi in chinatown is the best in town, great food, great service. I made a mistake, should have gone to Doh like I always do!",

    "text": "This place was pretty good. I liked the atmosphere: it was dim but still bright enough for a big party. I went in there with about 15 people for a birthday celebration and they were good with their service. It was constant and we didn't feel the pressure of ordering right. They were really patient about our huge orders of salmon!  I liked the taste of their salmon nigiri but it wasn't anything memorable. They usually put thin slices of lemon on top which most of us disregarded so opt out for it when you don't want any! Also, desert is only one per person, but really who needs more than one after a sushi buffet? Aha. One thing I really liked was their shrimp tempura. The batter was light and not oily.   We ordered other things too but nothing any other sushi place offers. This is the reason why I gave them a 4, nothing was memorable enough.",

Beginning with the fact that for under $30 you can eat all your want (appetizers, rolls, salads, soups & desserts). Lunch or Dinner. Yes-you heard right! Everything you can fit in that belly of yours!   Second- they do half rolls! Before you get too crazy ordering a ton load of rolls and run out of room to try almost all, take note that you can order a half roll of all your favorites. !!!WINNING!  Third-everything is amazing! My two faves would have to be the Volcano and Tiger roll. Holy Bejesus! Shrimp Tempura and Cucumber Salad is off the chain!!!   Conclusion: it's <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!

Let's see...the short story of it is, I really wasn't impressed or satisfied with their rolls and nigiri. There were only 4 items on the menu that I liked, though, they weren't life changing. With their rolls, we all looked at each other and were like wow, they really packed the rice in there - It was like a rice roll and not a sushi roll, all rice and no filling. It was very disappointing (and filling).   The good: -Sashimi Roll -  (1 order per person and it's an tiny itty bitty portion) we all really enjoyed the flavors on this one. Refreshing, sweet, and lovely fish texture and flavor.  -Salmon Nigiri - the salmon was sweet and buttery. The lemon slices on top were cut too thick so the flavor was too overwhelming and it took away from the salmon flavor. We ate the rest of the nigiri without it.  -Seafood Tostada - 1 crunchy wonton chip topped with a mystery seafood mix in a poke style marinade. It was crisp and refreshing.  - uni for AYCE was 1 order per person. It was very fresh and sweet.  The bad:  -Crunchy roll- a plain jane CA roll and some sprinkles of tempura flakes. Not sure what's the deal, but It wasn't even crunchy :/ -Big b roll - a very dense roll. This roll was so terrible, that everyone at the table made a weird face after they took a bite. We all didn't want to eat anymore. The meat on top was chewy, the rice was super dense and soggy, and the flavor profile was pretty strange, sour and didn't tie everything together.  -Spider roll - stuffed to the max with rice. A paper thin piece of crab, I think? We really didn't taste it.  -Baked mussels - severely dry as heck! Typically baked mussels are plump, juicy and topped with Japanese mayo and unagi sauce. This one didn't have any, or if they did, we didn't taste it. It was painful to eat.  -Miso soup - It came out room temperature and it tasted watery.  -Plum wine ice cream - it tasted like artificial bubblegum. We didn't finish it.  -Halibut nigiri - it had a ponzu-like sauce on it and it tasted like a very distinct artificial citrus and smoke flavor. We all agreed that they were mostly trying to mask an older fishy cut of halibut. -They didn't offer us the fried heads on our ama ebi nigiri (sweet shrimp) - that's the best part!   We also ordered a volcano roll, but it never made it to us and we were all actually extremely relieved about that. We all didn't want to deal with another train wreck.  For now, we will stick with Naka Sushi or Sakana until something else comes up.",

I'd also like to throw a very special THANK YOU to the sushi chef who (by request) made me a chefs special roll. I asked him to put ANYTHING together for me to try and he happily did and let me say, it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! :D SUSHI KOMA, YOU'RE MY 1 AND ONLY! thanks again Jessica! hope you're working next time I come in!",

I always leave feeling happy, mighty full and ready for a nap... which in opinion is what you look for with AYCE! It's a pretty busy little spot so prepare to wait and be patient because it is well worth the wait! Or you can always do call ahead seating and hope to not have as long a wait once you arrive (depending on the night you may still have a wait).",

The next day my dad told me he had diarrhea that night after sushi and he couldn't not work the full 8 hours the next day cause his diarrhea didn't stop. I was so mad with this stupid place that I had to come on Yelp and write down a review to warn everyone.   People please! Go search around other all you can eat sushi place around the town. So many more choices for the same price and I never had any stomach issues after eating sushi. This was the only time. I grew up eating raw fish, this restaurant is ridiculous.",

But the fish and rice were def off.  And I mean really off.  I can't imagine it just being an off night because overall AYCE sushi is not that good and they weren't even close to being at the AYCE acceptable level.  I have pretty low standards for sushi.  I expected to be as good as Island Sushi and Grill in LV or Midori in Ventura County (CA).  Worst hamachi, salmon, albacore nigiri that I've ever had.  White tuna was the best nigiri that I had that night. Rolls were really bad.  I mean how do you mess up something that has mayo, sauce, and rice?  Too many to mention.  The tempura was just okay.  The quesadilla is a waste of food space.  The gyoza was good.  Wish the food was better because they are awesome people.  Only been to Island Sushi and Grill before Koma.  Island is good for AYCE (not great) but Koma isn't even as close.  If this place is really the 4.5 stars that everyone raves about, you should give everyone else 10 stars.  When I come back to LV without the kids I think we're going to have to Goyemon.",

    "text": "The 5 star bump update review after a few visits. Yeeep.   I think the AYCE is pretty solid with some decent level of freshness. Of course, every sushi place has on/off days for certain fish, but overall everything has been in a good range of fresh that we've had. Also among our favorites are the seafood toastada, salmon skin handroll (unique in that it has perilla/shiso leaf),and  thanks to Tien, I always get spicy yellowtail handrolls here. Nigiri wise the super white tuna, yellowtail with a jalapeno slice, and scallop (which I order with a bit of masago on top) are among the most consistent in freshness and happen to be some of favorite nigiri anyways.   The real kicker for this place is the service. The ladies are fantastic about checking on you, refilling your drinks and clearing plates. They are friendly and talkative, but yet aren't intrusive. We've had several different servers and all of them were just as good as the other. Love this place for the service as this on point is very rare in AYCE, and sadly just not usual in restaurants to have that consistent of a staff.   We come late night and there hasn't ever been a wait, which is surprising since the place is small though traffic is steady. I can't speak for daytime though.   I really think this place will be our new spot as the service does it over the top for us. We used to be big fans of a place close by but lately it's been so busy that there's a wait and it's so busy that the consistency is slipping.   And yes, they have stamp cards now, I'm not sure if they always did. I did not know this so ask for one! I think that is my one little critique is they don't really mention the cards.  Still, I have my stamp card halfway filled and there's good reason.  (Yelp 100 Challenge 9/100)",

    "text": "Went to this place for my grandfathers first time having sushi. I've gone to sushi many times and this was my first one in Vegas.   When I walked in it was really tiny. I saw on here that others had deemed it kid friendly, but honestly... Just because they have high chairs doesn't make that so. It's really cramped in there so I wouldn't advise children under 3.   Anyways, here are the specs on the food. It was good food. The fish was really fresh, some of the freshest I've ever had. I always have thought that if you can get squid or octopus and have it not be like chewing fish gum you're in a good place. That's how this was  My only complaint is the not sharing food. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. Because of this policy we ordered a child's meal which was fine. However, we started getting our food before they did. How do you expect me to eat my food in front of my starving children and I'm NOT allowed to share? This was pretty infuriating.   Here's a few more cons: - the salmon skin hand roll was cremated. It was terrible. Absolutely terrible. It was like eating fish skin chips and not what it's supposed to be.  - it was a bit loud with contemporary music. - it is EXTREMELY cramped once it gets busier. I almost hit a few people with my 1 year old just trying to get out. - the high chair straps were DISGUSTING. I mean, they were just covered in various others kids meals to the point I couldn't tighten it down. It was stiff from all the yuck. - We are forced to buy kids meals but have no kid friendly beverages?  - many times we were delayed getting our food. How can you enforce a 45 minute time frame, but take 15 minutes to bring a couple things?   Anyways. It was great quality, don't get me wrong. But the other aspects weren't as great. Other than the Brie and grape quesidilla. That was amazing.  I probably wouldn't be back unless it wasn't my choice.",

So 5 stars  Just kidding, all jokes aside this is perhaps the best sushi spot in town or at minimum is ranked very high up there.  The service is unquestionably great and even on a busy night whether it's Michele or Aileen, that ends up helping my best friend and I, we end up giving nothing but praises for how outstanding they are to us.  That goes for the sushi chefs and the owner himself.  Indeed all a part of a winning ensemble.  Now let's talk sushi.. Rice holds, they have good size fish cuts, they're tasty and incredibly fresh!  Haven't had any fresher in this town.  Me and my bud are nigeri aficionados and indulge in tuna, yellowtail, salmon (tastiest I.M.O.), red snapper, super white, surf clam and uni.  The latter two being in my opinion the best in this town.  I've experienced bad uni and surf clam before but never here.  Oh and the sashimi roll is ridiculous.  5 stars through and through..",

Food is ok sushi quality Ive seen more fish to rice ratios but the literally let you eat until you cant move if thats what youre into. 4 stars.  Update. This was our go to spot for AYCE sushi near summerlin. Ever since they expanded the quality has gone down hill. We tried it for the last time on NYE and they were closing at 10pm. We showed up at 9:45 and owner or manager said 30 min wait. No problem. Then he said again 30 min wait. We were like no worries. Then he said again well just so you know we stop taking orders at 9:45pm. Then he said again. Actually we stop taking orders at 930pm. We got the point. He was very rude to my girlfriend and I and we said ok we get it. We'll take our business elsewhere. Would have given 3 stars but after being treated like that after we would come in weekly I will give it 2 stars. Better AYCE sushi spots out there or go to Naked Fish down the street for better sushi but not AYCE.",

    "text": "Omg! Hands down the best Sushi place I've been to.   My brother took our friends and I here during our visit in Vegas and we all fell in love with this place. I really wasn't expecting much from it especially after knowing that it was a All You Can Eat Sushi + appetizers. However, I was surprised by how amazing all the food, the service, and the ambience turned out.   The place didn't seem much from the outside but as soon as you walk in you're greeted with a warm welcome. The place is beautiful and not too overwhelming. It wasn't too busy when we got there so we were seated right away.   We were approached by our waitress immediately. She was helpful, friendly, and energetic. She was very informative about the menu and also made some suggestions as to what to order. Everyone there was very nice and upbeat. Our orders were taken and drinks were refilled continiously.  You don't even have to flag them down it's almost like they have sensors and know the perfect timing to refill your drinks/take more orders.  The menu itself was engaging. It's colorful and contained a list of food selection. There are different prices depending on what time of the day you come in to eat. For lunch it's about $21 and for dinner it's about $25 per person. Also, be aware that if you do not finish your food, you could be charged extra. Pace yourself and keep your order at a limit. If by any chance you want to try more food but unsure if you can finish it, you can get split orders.  Besides the all you can eat sushi there's  also several items on the menu that can only be ordered once.   We wanted to try everything on the menu and I'm pretty sure we came close to succeeding because somehow it felt like we packed a second stomach to have eaten all that food. Everything was just perfect!   And lets not forget desserts! If you still have any space in your tummy make sure to not forget an order of mochi ice cream! It' is the cherry on top to complete the perfect meal.   It's definitely going to be one of our go to places every time were in town. So, if you haven't tried this place out yet, I suggest you check it out! You won't be disappointed!",

I would definitely recommend recommend for you to try that one. And as an appetizer the teriyaki beef is to die for !",

This used to be my favorite spot, but I wish I never tried it again. I haven't been here for a couple of years because Sakana stole my heart. I should have left it that way.   Let's start with the service. I have never been to a empty AYCE sushi restaurant that takes like 30 minutes to get you 2 nigiri (because they only served us 1 order every 10 minutes for some reason). It was hard to get the waitresses attention and she always looked annoyed when we asked for our food.  Food: I left here still hungry and that's not supposed to happen after an AYCE restaurant, but I literally couldn't order anything else because it was unappetizing. You can't really taste any vinegar in the sushi rice. Nothing at all stood out as, \"I need that again!\" The rice to fish ratio was not very good. They give you some really small pieces of fish in the nigiri and that's why I even come to a place like this.",

It's much more spacious, compared to their cramped location before. The decor is so chill but nice at the same time.   The service is great too! The servers were super nice and always took care of us. My water cup was never empty honestly.   The fish tasted fresh and I enjoyed what I ordered! Their fish to rice ratio is not bad for the nigiri. I recommend ordering their Big B roll though! It's only one order per person, but it's so good! There's not many rolls I know that have meat in them, but it works!   The only thing that I did not really enjoy were their mochis. I ordered a coffee mochi ice cream, and it was rock hard. Even though I waited for it to melt, the outer layer was just dry and not pleasant. Usually it's chewy and soft, but it was too hard for me. I would stick to the green tea or plum wine ice cream instead.",

This place is very small and cute. It could easily fill up if I came on a busy day but gladly I came just in time. Was seated just before 3pm so still got the lunch AYCE price.   The menu is great and items that I thought would be Dinner only ended up being lunch as well. Like my favorite, Sashimi Roll! To die for! I can't believe you can order this during lunch. It's 1 per person though but that's understandable. Also got the seafood Tostada which I would assume with be dinner only but it's not. Delicious.   The fish were all fresh. The white tuna nigiri just melted in my mouth. Fish/rice ratio was just right. Some specialty rolls had a lil bit more rice than I wanted but it didn't over power the fish ratio. Glad I was able to order half rolls.  The service was alright. I think the rolls were coming out a little too slow. There was a lot of time when we were just sitting there waiting for our food but other than that the staff was attentive. I would definitely come here again. Prolly stands up there with Goyemon but doesn't surpass it quite yet...",

Cons: barely edible. The fish looks like it has been colored, smells and tastes fishy.   Not fresh fish.   Mayo on everything, greasy.   Can't do sashimi because the fish is so old, it's a big risk to eat it without having be smothered in mayo to mask it.   I love sushi and think it's important for the fish to be fresh and flash frozen previously to kill any parasites.   I ate two pieces of different sushi orders to give it a chance. Couldn't eat anymore than that. Left there hungry, ordered a pizza later.   I will not be going back.",

Even with our party of +15 people, service was attentive throughout. Staffs here are extremely friendly too.  Since our group had so many people, we decided to have a lead person order for everyone. Of course it didn't work out when one person yelled out \"wait I want tuna,\" while another yelled out \"Give me lots of Salmon.\" Confused as mofo, I just ate whatever was given in front of me.   Somewhat disappointed that sushi here had a dense block of rice which I am most decidedly not a fan of. All fish tasted fresh so that redeemed a little. I must say their Uni was the only memorable item. My favorite AYCE sushi spot Sakana limits on uni so I liked the fact that I was able to order uni until I fell in Koma. Ha. It was fresh and buttery.  Stuffed myself with lots of sushi then finished off with a scoop of green tea ice cream which sadly ended up falling off my spoon and down to the floor. Our party all left satisfied after a great time sharing sushi. Not my favorite sushi spot but I wouldn't mind coming back again.",

I wish I had read into the reviews and realized that this was an all you can eat place before we came, because I would have chosen a different sushi restaurant. The speed at which the kitchen is working may be necessary to feed hungry people lots of plates, but they are unintentionally cutting corners on quality. The dynamite appetizer with scallops was overcooked, or possibly cooked and then left for a while, then reheated, because the little scallops tasted unpleasantly fishy and extremely rubbery. The dish was also made with mostly onions, and very little of the actual scallops. I have never had it made that way before. I love onions, so I didn't particularly mind. But the presence of multiple onion skins inside made it difficult to eat and left my daughter choking on them. Cutting the skins off of an onion before cooking them for customers is very basic and expected. The sushi itself was decent, though over-sauced and not anything special.  Basically, this rating suffered for the inattention to detail and quality. I hope other people have better experiences!",

It wasn't even busy today and the wrong rolls ended up on our table one too many times. Our waitress clearly wrote our order down word for word and even repeated the order. Also, my sister ordered a sprite, but a guy came with a pitcher of water and refilled her cup after she said \"no thank you\" and left.",

It's not a 10/10 because there was only one person for the packed house to take the orders and I had to wait longer than usual for the rest of my order after I received the drinks... however, it looks like they have at least 6-7 bussers to clean up and tend to you and it was all smooth sailing after I got the rest of my orders in! They have really cute mugs for your tea, the rolls are delicious minus the salmon skin roll. It tasted way too fishy and salty. Everything else was superb. I'm also impressed with the fresh wasabi. They do it right. I also appreciate that any roll can be turned into a hand roll upon request. I ordered & loved AYCE: Appetizer, Seared Tuna Carpaccio, cucumber salad (it's not in vinegar sauce u fortunately, more of a creamy sesame sauce), fresh wasabi and eel sauce on the side, half order of Alex Munchie Roll, Denver Hand Roll.",

When attempting to split the bill, one card was charged the entire amount. Wrong change was delivered to the table. The only sincere apologies came from the hostess who accidentally ran the cards incorrectly. When the manager was requested, he didn't even go over the transactions to make sure everything was correct. Their lack of professionalism was evident in every aspect of our visit, and nothing was done (or even offered) to make it right. Would not recommend unless you want sub-par sushi and bad service.",

Once on Sunday night and today before our flight. Forget going to overpriced restaurants on the strip, if you have some wheels, it is so worth it to drive down Flamingo drive to Sushi Freak. This has got to be one of the best sushi places EVER! The rolls are very creative and very good! A must try is the Big B Roll--do it! because you won't regret it.   We got the AYCE deal and what's cool is that you can even order half rolls to try out more of the selection. Fish is very fresh. Service is really good and attentive. Great interaction with staff and the owner. We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town and this is gonna be one of the places we recommend to friends going to LV.",

My boyfriend and I were a bit disappointed with the quality and variety of sushi, appetizers and desserts that they offered. For dinner, they charged $25.95 for AYCE...a bit pricey compared to the other sushi joints that offered a better menu selection for their AYCE and charged the same amount.  I can say the 3 stars came from the great service that they provided and probably the Sashimi Roll (salmon and tuna wrapped in thinly sliced daikon).   Overall... This is just another ordinary sushi joint.",

This is one of the few places I've been to where you can actually taste the sushi rather than just fill up on it.   There are a few things on the AYCE menu that you can only get once- GET THEM. The dynamite roll, sashimi roll (tiny but is refreshingly tasteful) and seafood tostada. In general this place serves smaller portions but I appreciate it because you get the quality of the food back. Everything is very fresh and has SO many flavors that you can actually taste. Also get as much nigiri as you can-it's amazingly fresh!   The green tea mochi tasted like it was boxed mochi, which is fine- except it was super old. So it mostly tasted like carbonation and sugar.   Also the service isn't that great. The waiter we had pretty much looked like he hated everything. Which is fine because being in service positions suck but please don't show it at your workplace. We still tipped well because he looked like he could use a pick me up. This place is a must!",

I especially loved the SSS roll, spicy, crunchy tempura shrimp inside.  YUM!  Most of the rolls are on the smaller side which is great bc you're not filling up on 2 rolls and done.  They also do half rolls which I prefer.  My MO for AYCEs is the try as many different rolls and appetizers as possible. :)  Also worth mentioning is the tuna tataki with little fried shallots on top.  Very garlicky and intensely flavored.

My husband is not a big fan of the raw stuff so he was really excited that there were so many cooked roll choices . I on the other hand love nigiri. There were a lot of items to choose from and left happy and full :). Only thing that was a little annoying was the seating once it gets full the tables get very crowded and you have to squeeze through all the chairs and tables .",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Best - I have to start by saying that this is my new \"go to place\" for sushi.         - Freshness - I usually go half nigiri/half sushi rolls, but tasting that first piece of sushi my first night, I had to go all nigiri for the night. It was definitely some of the freshest sushi I've tasted this side of the Mojave Desert.        - Next Level - All the nigiri have their own little touches. The salmon has a lemon wedge, the yellowtail has a thin slice of jalapeno, and the sweet shrimp has a sprinkle of sea salt and a splash of lemon juice. It's these little things that take these ordinary nigiri dishes to the next level.        - Creative - You can ask the sushi chef to create something for you and you'll see why they chose to name the place sushi freak. I got salmon with cornflakes on top and it was delicous.        - Expertise - The ex-head chef from RA at the Fashion Show opened this restaurant 3 weeks ago bringing with him some of the freshest fish suppliers.        - Waiting List - The place is very small so I'd suggest calling ahead or going at off-peak hours. Trust me, it's worth the extra effort. There's a reason there are people waiting outside for a seat.        - Brian's Beach - This use to be Brian's Beach and as of March 1st, 2012, the sign is still up.  **Price**        - $21.95 11:30am-4pm AYCE Lunch        - $26.95 4pm-3am AYCE Dinner **Menu** <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A?select=CRIJHtvoQAlPDg5XIbV7oQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dEAk...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dEAk-gE-5Q95a7p91gNn8A?select=AY-RzhlhTkh8mSZ3bKQphg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dEAk...</a> **Nigiri**        - Saba - Mackerel with a special soy based sauce.

    "text": "Raw fish is a necessity and watch over those who come in between me and my sushi. When these cravings hit, find me the closest AYCE joint because I am ready to grub someone out of business.   My friend had arrived early and waited inside for me. When you walk in, you see everything. The restaurant is small. We were placed at a two top near the divider which separates the front door from the dining area. At times, the table got cramped, but the pace of the sushi chefs helped to not overrun our table. During periods where we sat empty, the waitresses came up to thank us for our patience and made sure we were doing well. Quick refills on our iced green tea helped to not unleash any negativity. If one point of service fell behind, the other made up for it.   The sushi rice held up rather well and rarely fell apart. The fish was fresh and was not masked by an overabundance of sauce. A small drizzle across to lend some flavor. My friend and I dined off of the nigiri and appetizer menu. She is allergic to shrimp, so most of the rolls were a no go. Even with our limitation, those two portions of the menu was enough to get us full. The fish to rice ratio is even. Sushi Freak does not overload on the carbs. Besides the nigiri, the Brie and Grape Quesadillas are delicious and innovative. I like the garlic chips on the Tuna Carpaccio. I would pop these nonstop if they offer them. Ask for octopus, squid, scallops, or salmon to come with a sliver of lemon to accentuate the flavor. The yellowtail came out with a slice of jalapeno and that transformed a fish I normally don't like into something magical.",

I had a little bit of a wait with my appetizer and rolls coming out but it was understandable as it was, after all, 6pm on a Friday night and they were veryyyy busy and there was a rather large party there as well. But when my food finally came out, it was totally worth the wait. The Brie and grape quesadilla was so yummy and the Kimmi and Alex rolls were freaking delicious. My only regret is that I didn't have more room to try more rolls. :(",

It felt pretty nasty to have a waterlogged ball of mushy rice in my  mouth. I have always heard that the rice is the most important component and now I understand why. As for the good notes... the seafood tostada was pretty good as was the bulgogi. The red bean mochi was a nice way to end the meal. I took a gamble trying this place after reading a ton of great reviews and a few that were negative. I wish I had gone somewhere else because 26 bucks is a lot of cash to me.",

When I ordered the next one they told me there was a charge so I said to just put it on seaweed and charge for the first one.  I didn't care about the $1 and was willing to pay.  I felt badly for the waitress who was somewhat new and thought since she hadn't told me there was a fee that I shouldn't have to pay.  It was $1, I wasn't concerned.  I just wasn't so happy with the attitude from the sushi guy when I had already said not to worry about it, and charge me for it if they needed to charge.  I still give them 5 stars because A) The food was really excellent.  And B) As a restaurant owner, I know sometimes employee's are employee's and they don't mean to come off the way they come off",

The service was very weird, we were asked by four different people in the span of three minutes if we were doing all you can eat, and when we said no, they seemed put off. I was just in the mood for one or two rolls sorry! The menu was expensive for the average flavor that I tasted, and I wouldn't have minded as much if they weren't so all over the place with taking our order, and if it didn't take almost fifteen minutes to ask for the check when they weren't busy at all. I didn't order a ton of the menu, so i'm just giving an average review based on my experience. Apparently they are awesome for AYCE so maybe i'll try back next time when I'm hungrier.",

I'm use to sushi on a conveyor belt and ordering right from the chef and when I sat down, so, I thought the service was going to be faster. Little did I know that you have to order all of your dishes (or at least some of them) at once. I would eat one order and then sit for a long time with no food as they were making everything fresh. DUH! I learned because once I received my order it was EXCELLENT sushi. My initial order was the sushi lasagne (i am not sure if that is the name, again, co worker recommended) I thought I died and had gone to sushi heaven. Kicked myself for not ordering two! I ended my \"all you can eat\" meal with the Stephanie Roll. It was so refreshingly fresh that I was satisfied for the rest of the night. I can't wait to go back and will be a regular. When my brother comes from LA, he is in for a sushi treat! Highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have been to Sushi Koma many many times over the last several years, since it was Brian's Beach and Sushi Freak, but I only recently joined Yelp. So one of the first things I have to do is tell everyone how great this place is. On the other hand, if too many people find out about Sushi Koma, it might get too crowded, and I will have a hard time getting a table...  We love sushi in our house, but my biggest complaint at every other restaurant is always how long I have to wait. Seriously, anywhere else you will have to wait for either a round of sushi, a greeting, or the check for so long that you could take a 15 minute nap or longer. But somehow Sushi Koma is the only restaurant on the planet that has figured out how to make your custom order super fast. Everyone works together to take your order(s), bring your drinks, food, check & change, all while keeping your table maintained & as clutter-free as possible.  Sushi Koma offers an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) option, and at $26 per person for dinner, you can't go wrong. The sushi quality is outstanding and on par with other establishments that don't offer AYCE and have bills that might be three times higher. (I guess the last sentence makes it obvious that I can pack away a lot of sushi!)  If you want a sushi kind of appetizer, get the sashimi roll and/or tuna carpaccio. If you want something non-sushi, I recommend the gyoza and ask for it pan-fried. All of these & more are included in the AYCE menu, plus deserts. (I like their green tea flavored mochi ice cream for desert. It is small - good when you are already stuffed - and is a really nice way to end the meal.)  The biggest negative is that it is such a tiny little place, so it gets crowded fast. When we go, we try to get there early to avoid the wait - 5:30 seems to work pretty well. But with fast & friendly service, terrific food & AYCE prices, it is worth the wait if you have to!  Finding it: Sushi Koma is located in the shopping center at the southwest corner of Flamingo & Durango. Enter the parking lot is on the Flamingo side.",

Do not take the name lightly - I have left in a Sushi Koma numerous times. Kudos to the team here.",

For $25, you can choose the All you Can Eat special so you never have to worry about your bill going crazy.  My Faves:  Dynamite Appetizer: a baked scallop dish in a savory creamy sauce.  Tuna Carpaccio: The Bomb! These two dishes are so good you are limited to 1 per person for AYCE.  Love the Salmon Sushi, yellowtail, and Tuna are always my faves. The Chef also brought over some Toro Sushi on the house that was amazing. Finished off with Green Tea Ice Cream included in the special.  A new favorite spot!",

    "text": "I ate here last night with Eric R. and Tony T. and then once a year ago around this time.  A year ago, Eric R. called and reserved seats at the sushi bar once he confirmed the Texas football game was on TV, so we came to dine and watch football.  Last night we got there around 6:45 PM on a Sunday night and it was very packed except for 4 sushi bar spots open by the door.  The host told us 2 were reserved and since we were a party of 3, we could wait for others to finish - that was fine.  Later the host said the people who made the reservations were not coming so we could sit there.  Soon, 3 people got up from the bar further into the restaurant so we asked to sit there, away from the door.  The male server/chef said sure, so we went to sit there but the host then said the reserved sign on the first seats that we were not allowed to sit on now must be moved to the other side of the bar because those customers like \"seats 1 and 2\" even though she said they were not coming.  The male server/chef and the host argued and finally we were allowed to sit away from the door.  After we were seated, the whole bar cleared and no one showed up for the reservation, so all of that was annoying.  Once seated we tried a lot of different things.  I had iced green tea which was nice and grassy.  The standouts for me were the mackerel and the ika with shiso leaf.  They were so good that I ordered them twice.  The mackerel was perfectly cured - not dry, too meaty, or fishy, topped with grated ginger and chopped negi.  The squid was very fresh and not too chewy.  I really enjoyed both of these the most.  The whole scallop sushi was really fresh too.  The pretty good items were the hamachi (we got belly cuts on request) with serrano pepper, salmon nigiri, tako, uni, amaebi (some were missing tails, and we requested the heads after and they were very small and oily but tasted okay).  Eric R. and Tony T. had some things I did not try, including surf clam, halibut, escolar, unagi, maguro, tamago, masago with quail egg and ikura.  They both had the teriyaki/bulgogi beef which was actually almost exactly like gyudon and pretty tasty.  I also had a yellowtail jalapeno handroll which was fine.  The bad: Tony T. and I both ordered salmon skin temaki early in the meal.  The chef tried to discourage us because \"it takes at least 10 minutes\" - I did not mind because it is normal to wait for the skin to bake/toast, so we said sure.  Well when it came out, I heard Tony crunch his a little but all of the skin (and there was A LOT) was just raw fat and skin, not hot or cooked at all!  I pulled all of it out and put it on a plate, and showed the chef.  I did not want another one but I wanted him to know this was unacceptable so he did not serve it to anyone else.  He apologized and said he should have checked it before serving, but this was not his fault but whoever made it in the kitchen.  I did not want another one and a server snatched it out of my hand and whisked it away.  Tony T. also ordered seared tuna carpaccio which the restaurant initially forgot and when it was delivered it looked kind of like cat food.  He said it was very salty.  For dessert the AYCE says only one mochi but Eric R. ordered 2 without any issue.  I got plum wine ice cream which tasted exactly like bubblegum ice cream and it was nasty.  Don't do it!  I should just stick with my uni as dessert policy.  Overall, it satisfied our sushi cravings in the area since Taiga and 808 Tapas were closed, but I would not rush back.  I would definitely recommend a stop here for saba and ika lovers though, because they were pretty great.  Also I second Drew A. on the pricing - if you do not do AYCE you end up paying bizarre prices like $9 for a tiny bowl of the beef.  The nigiri is priced almost $2 higher per order than other a la carte places too.  The chefs were friendly but swamped and it was very hard to order anything because they did not often look up at anyone at the bar, which was sunken.  Drinks were refilled often and the service was otherwise very good.  Open til 3 AM even on Sunday!",

The server sat me down at a table and it took 7 minutes before they even took a drink order. I had to look for the menu because i was not given one. I had to ask for the ginger and wasabi after 3 min of getting my first order; then i had to grab my own napkin from the table next to me because the table I was placed didn't have anything on it. the servers were either walking by looking down on a piece of paper or they would look past you. it was hard to get any of the servers attention because the music was on pretty loud.  if i could give them a 0 star it would be that for their service",

One thing that I would recommend is to go during lunch time to get your money's worth, as the dinner price comes with only a few additional choices.  As for the service, it's above average compared to other sushi places. The servers are friendly. It can get packed, specially during dinner time. It can slow down the rate at which the food comes, but it's to be expected.   Unfortunately, I can't give this place a five because everything else in their menu is mediocre. Their specialty rolls and their appetizers weren't that special. It's a big set back to being a \"perfect sushi restaurant\" if not everything is up to par with the best selections in the menu. But, like I said, if you're looking for a nigiri place, you've found it.",

That's why whenever I come \"home\" to Vegas,  Sushi Koma is ALWAYS on my to-do list. My friends and I had dinner there last night and once again,  Sushi Koma did not disappoint!!!

Of the nigiri we tried the tuna and fresh water eel were the standouts. The yellowtail and halibut were decent as well. The cuts of fish were ample sized and more than covered the rice underneath.  The rolls we tried were well formed and used a minimal amount of rice -- about two grains thick. The Stephanie roll had chopped albacore, shrimp wrapped with sliced avocado and garlic ponzu sauce. The Jane roll was a yellowtail roll wrapped with spic tuna on top.   Other items that made their way to my plate and into my stomach are the seafood tostada and vegetable tempura. The tostada consisted of a variety of diced up fish, garlic chips, green onions and sesame seeds on a thin square that had a fried wonton texture to it. It was a good mix of flavors and textures, but a little messy to eat.  The veggie tempura was pretty standard and the batter was rather unimpressive and bland.  The service was both fast and efficient when it came to ordering and receiving our food.",

    "text": "Sushi Freak has dethroned Goyemon as my favorite AYCE restaurant.  I've been here four times in less than a month, bringing different friends to experience it. There's not much in the way of atmosphere, but they more than make up for it with amazing food and service.  The fish is extremely fresh - I've only really gotten into sushi within the last year or so and was never sure if I could discern good quality from bad, but I can really taste the difference here. The super white tuna is sublimely buttery and almost melts in your mouth. It's always a favorite of mine, but the quality and freshness here is beyond what I've experienced anywhere else. I've also had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, and snapper nigiri, and all were similarly fresh. As mentioned in previous reviews, a lot of the nigiri comes with garnish. The garlic tuna comes with a dollop of minced garlic on top, and the salmon is served with a lemon twist. I don't mind this, and it can easily be removed if it's not to your taste.   As enamored as I am with the nigiri, I haven't tried many rolls. The two I've been ordering regularly are Jane and Ponzio. Jane is yellowtail and cucumber inside with spicy tuna on top, and Ponzio features tuna, albacore, and avocado, topped with albacore and finished with ponzu and sprouts. The rolls are pretty small, and they allow half-orders for AYCE, so it's easy to try them until you find your favorites.  The tuna carpaccio appetizer is topped with delicious fried garlic slivers, ponzu, and yum yum sauce. I'm not a mayo fan and find that the yum yum overpowers the fish, so I ask them to leave it off. The dessert selection consists of a nice variety of ice cream and mochi flavors, but is missing some of the more unique options found at Goyemon.  The service has been amazing on every occasion. This is a very small restaurant and it's never been busy when I've dined, but there are always at least two servers and two sushi chefs working. Orders come out very quickly and plates are cleared as soon as they're emptied. The servers are all very friendly and attentive, and frequently check if you'd like to order more - a nice change from some places where you feel like you have to tackle someone to put an order in.  I'm really struggling to come up with negative aspects of Sushi Freak. The only very minor issues I can think of are the lack of fresh wasabi and the limited dessert options. The fresh fish and friendly, fast service put them at the top of my list.",

    "text": "My friends and I wanted to do Goyemon at 9pm, but the wait was two hours long. Uhh, okay, plan B?  I remembered reading about Sushi Freak on Yelp, and they were only a few miles away, so we called them up. No wait, you say? Interesting. When we got there at around 9:30, there was nobody around but us and the employees. Yeah, they weren't kidding.  If the indicator of a good AYCE sushi experience is the intensity of the food coma that you get afterward, then this one has to rank among the best. The variety and quality of appetizers is pretty ridiculous, and I didn't even get to try the dynamite or the beef teriyaki. Only managed to try four of their many rolls as well. The nigiri was solid. I've gotta come back here eventually, and I definitely envy people who live on this side of town because they have Goyemon and a place that made me forget mostly about Goyemon for one night.  (short version of the review ends here... read on for details that I felt obligated to include)  We had a bunch of appetizers first, appropriate enough. Yeah, they were pretty \"freaky.\" One app was fish on a mini tostada mixed with diced tomatoes and sprinkled with crunchy garlic slices. Pretty good! And those brie and grape quesadillas, whoa. They're a nice cleanser between spicy or tangy portions. The tuna carpaccio was also really delish and featured the crunchy garlic. The sashimi roll didn't seem that flavorful to me though. Oh yeah, obviously we had to have the mussels, which are actually 5 per order. Loved them. All of these were pretty much one order per person, but that's fine since you still wanna have room for later.  Speaking of which... the nigiri and rolls were just as enjoyable. I'm lame, so I picked the lemon slices off the salmon nigiri and the jalapenos off the yellowtail (after I bravely tried one piece). Oh yeah, we were able to get garlic tuna and cajun albacore (latter by waitress suggestion), which I don't think were on the menu. Garlic tuna wasn't the best I've had around Vegas, but cajun albacore is up there. For some reason, the super white (\"white tuna\") was really great the first time and not so good the second time. Maybe we were just that hungry? But then again, my sweet shrimp heads arrived near the very end of our session, and I still enjoyed those a lot.  Dessert for me was mochi and my buddy's green tea ice cream. They have a lot of mochi flavors compared to other places, and I picked coffee, which was just awesome. The ice cream was also good, and it seemed to be a larger portion than I usually see. That and the shrimp heads were a nice end to a nice meal.  Overall, service was pretty good. Waitress seemed a bit flustered all night, miscounting utensils and forgetting to state policies up front, but she did give us some nice suggestions to order from the \"secret\" menu, including that tostada. The speed was nice though. Actually, our (large) first order was coming out so fast that she offered to ask them to slow it down a little. Not bad at all. Also, the employees' shirts even told us to freak until 3 am. Yeah, I think I could live with their attitude. Maybe I'll do a late night jaunt some time to see if they live up to that. Or maybe I'll go at lunch instead... the lighting tonight seemed a little dim to me. Would've loved to see the colors stand out more, but live with what you can I guess.",

The best part is that they're open until 3am, so you can satisfy those late-night fish cravings. The seafood tostada is fantastic! It's like Hawaii meets Mexico (crispy wonton chip with pico de gallo and poke!).   The space is small, so there might be a little wait. But it's definitely worth it. Plenty of parking in a large stripmall lot.",

    "text": "Went there around 10 pm last Sunday for AYCE. It is a tiny restaurant with tiny tables, so it could be challenging when the food arrived while you have drinks, plates, soy sauce, menu, etc already taking up half of the table. Service was good, servers were very attentive and food arrived quite quickly (maybe because not during normal rush hour). Sushi and all plates are very tiny, consistent with the size of the restaurant, but it was actually good because you can order and try many different plates. Fish was very fresh and the hot food was great too. Tempura ice cream or fried banana were not part of the AYCE menu but for $5 each, you get a gigantic plate of goodness. Not a big fan of the seaweed salad, overdressed. Other than that, this is an awesome place for good food, good service at a good price.",

There's nothing really special about this place other than a few special rolls that don't pack much of a punch.  Seaweed Salad: 3/5 They're seaweed salad is prepared a bit different taste the same though as most places. I think this place LOVES SAUCE. I HATE things being over sauced. Their seaweed salad came with a drizzle of a yellow sauce on top of it. It made no difference to the flavor. Tasted like a normal seaweed salad a little more watery than usual.   Their version of poke: 2/5 Wasn't impressed, I was very disappointed that they didn't have an Ahi poke every places has this. Instead they had a Spanish version of poke. It was like tuna with salsa on top of a chip.  D.A. Roll: 1/5 I'm not much into deep fried rolls so this wasn't something I ordered. They mistakenly brought it to my table but since we had AYCE we didn't mind eating it.   Sashimi Roll: 4/5 The only special thing I kind of liked on the menu. I was blown away when yelpers said there was a sushi spot that made sashimi rolls. I had to try it. Basically its your assorted fish wrapped with a thin slice of radish. The radish adds an odd flavor to the sashimi that makes the roll a bit sour and yucky.   Nigiri: 4/5 Probably the only good thing about this place. The ratio of Fish to rice was just perfect 50/50. Yet we all know more fish than rice is what we really want. The fish was really fresh too. The salmon nigiri came with thin slices   Tuna carpaccio:0/5 EKK OVERLY SAUCED! The thin slices of tuna were super thin and it was drenched with sauces. The caramelized toasted garlic added an eerie flavor. The Tuna Carpaccio I absolutely hated it.   Baked Green Mussel: 4/5 The Baked green mussels were delicious not as sweet as orders and it was cut into 3 pieces than your usual 2 pieces. Unfortunately its 1 order person which makes it limited.   AYCE: 3/5 Is limited all you can eat is suppose to be ALL YOU CAN EAT but here it seems like more than 10 items are LIMITED to one order per person. I don't like that.. I hate limitations lol  Overall Doubt I'll come here again, the sushi was eh okay wasn't amazing.",

    "text": "This place is the new \"Brian's Beach\" which had located in this spot beforehand. Their sign may still say Brian's Beach but as the owner had said, they are replacing the sign soon.   This is located on the southwest corner of Flamingo and Durango facing east on the west side of the shopping center.   Hours are 11:30 AM - 4:00 PM for lunch, 4:00 PM - 11:30 PM for dinner, and 11:30 PM - 3:00 AM for late night. Their prices are quite average in terms of an all you can eat sushi restaurant for lunch and dinner, standing at $21.95 and $25.95 respectively.  Upon entrance to the restaurant, you are greeted by both the waitress staff as well as the owner and sushi chefs. Service is phenomenal. The place seems to have been remodeled or redesigned, so in my opinion, actually looks better.   I was taken to a seat at the sushi bar sitting directly in front of the owner/sushi chef. Heres a little background on the owner. He used to be the head chef at the sushi restaurant located at Fashion Show called RA Sushi. During one of my many conversations with the owner, I had been told that he was quite restricted by the management on how sushi was made. As a proud sushi chef, it was not something he could put up to as it was considerably lower than his own standards in sushi making. So he decided to take over this location, and start his own sushi restaurant.  Now about the food.   My plan was to try the fishes (nigiri), as it was one of my favorites when it comes to sushi. The sweet, fresh taste of different types of seafood is quite the experience if its something you can handle (some people cant eat raw foods). As i was informed by the chef/owner, new shipments of the fishes are delivered daily so you get the freshest fish when you come eat at this restaurant.   I started my experience with an order of tuna, white tuna, and yellowtail. For the record, by the time I finished my meal, i had tried most of the nigiri at least once. With tasting of the first 3 orders, I was surprised by the quality of fish they had prepared. Very fresh, and sweet.   One little nitpick i had while i was eating here was the chef/owner tends to put various sauces (yum yum? ponzu?) or toppings on his sushi. As he had said, a lot of people like it like that, but for me personally, it was ok. But with a slight notice, he had reduced the amount of sauces/toppings there after for me so it was nice that he listened. I mean, it wasn't bad for the most part, it was quite the experience, for example, having a slice of chili on top of yellowtail nigiri. It was interesting, as i liked eating spicy foods as well. It was a different experience.   I had told the chef that i was a fish eater, so after this first 3 orders, he took into command and had made various dishes for me. Most of my meal were made without ordering. Most were vary tasty and delicious.   In terms of nigiri, my favorites were probably the white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, sweet shrimp, and scallop. All very fresh, naturally sweet, nice thick cut (if applicable). The sweet shrimp was quite large for what i had been used to. But as the name implies, it was really sweet.   There was a few things i'd like to mention that you may not see in a typical sushi restaurant (or any that i had been to). Under their appetizer listing, they had \"brie and grape quesadilla\" and \"sashimi roll\"  Let's start off with the \"brie and grape quesadilla\". Seeing an item like this on the menu surprised me. Not something you usually see in a japanese restaurant. But it was suggested by one of the super nice waitresses. So i had tried it. When the order came, it was presented in a few triangle slices as well as a few avocado slices fanned on the side. Fresh off the pan/grill/whatever they used to make it. The taste was quite interesting. The brie was smooth and rich while the slices of grape gave it a nice acidic kick.   The \"sashimi roll\" was quite the interesting item. It contains tuna, yellowtail, white fish, salmon, shrimp, avocado, and asparagus wrapped in a thin daikon radish that was previously soaked in a special vinegar. Not too much of a fan on the sauces that were drizzled on the plate, but aside from that, the pickled daikon radish plus the various fishes gave quite the interesting taste. The freshness of the fish + the slightly sour, but refreshing taste of the pickled daikon that it was wrapped it was quite nice.   All in all, it was a good experience, and would love to go there again.   This restaurant definitely ranks in the top 3 sushi restaurants for me (at the time of this posting...), with Sushi Twister and Goyemon as the other 2 restaurants in the ranking. The staff and chefs were super nice. Did very little to no asking as they were very, i wouldnt say annoying but, uhm.. i guess attentive may be the correct word? I had no more than 1-2 finished plates on the side of me before they were picked up, and i had rarely, if ever saw the bottom of my tea cup, as it was always refilled in a timely manner.",

The quality of the fish is great and the owner is such a nice guy. When hes there the sushi is amazing. The only problem is that the space is small and the staff really is just running around the whole time. Its hard to get drinks or appetizers. This is an all you can eat place which is great and totally worth it. They have a seafood tostada which is a bunch of fish and tomatoes, onion, and jalapeno on a crispy tortilla thing. Its great. Its busy on weekends and the wait can be long but they really do have great sushi.",

    "text": "The Sushi place formerly known as Brian's Beach (the sign still says Brian's Beach, btw).  I went here with some sushi-loving friends - me, I'm not a fan of anything from the sea. I was prepared to get my teriyaki bowl and keep my mouth shut as they noshed on roll after roll. Unfortunately, the place was all out of chicken and the waitress had no idea when they would even get more in. Not sure what that meant, but based on the fact the restaurant was clean and all the ingredients in the sushi/my orders were nice and fresh, I am assuming they're pretty picky about where they get their ingredients from.  I got the steak teriyaki bowl instead and ordered the brie & grape quesadilla as an amuse-bouche - it was really good. Maybe a bit burned, but brie and grapes are such a treat and who knew they'd serve them at a sushi place?  The all-you-can-eat sushi deal had my friends thrilled - they recommended ordering half rolls of everything you want to try because you can always order more if you like it. They don't really advertise half rolls on the menu so take advantage of that on rolls you aren't confident you can eat all of.  The service was okay, the waitress was really nice but she couldn't tell what roll was what when she was delivering them to the table. Not her fault (they do all sort of look the same) - maybe we needed to order less and be more cognizant of what we were asking for so we could decipher for ourselves.  This restaurant is TINY - probably only seats about 20 people at tables, maybe 10 at the bar. We went at 6:30 on a Sunday and had to wait for a table for about 20 minutes (and there's no waiting area, so it was stand in the door way). Don't jostle the buddha while you're waiting.",

The food was pretty good but the rice to fish portion has a little too much rice. My reason for giving this place 3 stars is because I had a lot of issues with the timing of the food coming out. On multiple occasions they forgot we ordered things and times we had to remind them 3 times until it came out. It seemed our orders always came really late or they forget, or take the wrong orders. I did notice the table next to us also had a big group but had really fast service so perhaps it was just our table. I did not realize that it's 1 dessert per person so my table ordered the max and I didn't get any and the waitress was nice enough to just give one to me. Overall nice waitresses food was good, perhaps more waitresses.",

We were all nigiri or raw fish fans. We all opted for the AYCE lunch and ordered some nigiris to start with, and the waitress apologized as there was only one chef and the other was late. We were very understanding, but as we waited and waited for our food, we couldn't understand why it was taking so long. We were the only people in there and they just opened, and we only ordered nigiri, which is just raw fish and rice! It took 20 minutes to get our orders, and most of our 1 1/2 lunch was spent sitting around waiting for food. It would be okay if the food was good, but the fish wasn't fresh or exciting. The fish tasted bland and tasteless. Salmon was off color. Tasted more like something from a very mediocre sushi restaurant, which I think this was. I will never go back again. I am a huge sushi aficionado and have been to very many sushi restaurants, and this was one of the worst I've been to.",

Green muscles (usually take a while so order first) My favorite roll is the twist octopus which is simple, clean and delicious.

Last visit before yesterday wasn't so great, but I didn't leave a review as i thought maybe they were having an \"off day.\" Seems to be the case. Yesterday, service and food were both really good. The place was full, but we got lucky and were seated within 5 minutes. Even with a full house, our food orders came out pretty fast the first time around. Second order was a little slower as I think since we were doing AYCE and already ate quite a bit, they probably focus on the new customers' first order. I'm ok with that, as it's a smart service model. Sushi was fresh and tasty. Salmon didn't come out with lemon wedges first time but did on second. I don't mind it either way, just seemed odd it was different the second time around. We paid $16.95 for AYCE for our 6 year old since one roll from the kid's menu doesn't excite her. She prefers the Nigiri. It paid for itself since she had one roll plus several nigiri but it seemed high at first. They did seem short staffed and the girls were working hard. Service was good but we did have to flag them down a few times to get their attention. Overall though, a good experience. I'll go back.",

The second they told me again 30 minutes wait when I showed up on time. Too many other good sushi places in town to make it worth the hassle. Besides the place is small, crowded and not comfortable looking. I'm not an AYCE fan to begin with, so I'm going to stick with my regular favorites like Yonaka, Soho Japanese, Kabuki and Nobu.",

    "text": "My first AYCE sushi experience since moving to Las Vegas was Sushi Koma. Don`t ask me exactly what rolls I ate, because I have no idea, but I will say that this place is good for a few reasons.  1. I like small places that get filled up around lunch. That, to me, means that this place has a following and that it is worth trying. As soon as my friend and I sat down, people started to flow in and it got cray cray real quick.  2. They do not overdo the rice! Thank you! There is nothing worse than getting a sushi roll or order of nigiri and having a mini bowling ball of freakin' rice to eat. You fill up to quick and you start to question your life decisions after too much sushi rice. 3. Their flavors are on point. What I mean is that sometimes I go to sushi and a roll is either too sweet or too spicy or too something. Nope. Pretty balanced here. Also, I feel like their roll sizes(long and hand....heh)are good. Not too overwhelming and ugly but also not too small and unsatisfying(it's important to be satisfied, people). I know for sure I ate their green mussels, which I thoroughly may consider marrying because they were so good! Also, another contender for my heart was the cajun albacore nigiri. I could seriously just eat that and be happy for a meal. SO GOOD! Try it and thank me later. Oh! Their salmon skin roll also; delicious, salmon skin bacon that I want in my mouth all the time.   We've explored the good, now let's touch briefly on the places that need improvement and basically it is that the service can be a bit slow and disorganized. I was expecting to get \"the sheet\" that you usually get at an AYCE sushi place, but instead I got \"the server\" who had to take down an order each time and it was just a slight annoyance on my part because I`m used to just filling out a sushi sheet and sending it on its way instead of having to verbalize each thing I want to order. Minor, but something to think about.   Overall, I want to come back here. AYCE lunch was like $22, which I think is alright considering the quality and amount of choices. Side note: The staff was very friendly, but just a bit all over the place. Go here and get all the fishies in your belly.",

    "text": "To be blunt: as far as my knowledge of sushi goes, I know about as much as Jon Snow. I have had it on several occasions but can never remember what I ordered or differentiate between items. Lucky for me, Chad 'The Sushi Guru' S. accompanied me on my first visit to Sushi Koma.  SK is nestled in a shopping plaza right next to Cafe Darak and some hookah joint. After entering we were immediately greeted by several of the sushi chefs and waitresses. It was this very moment when I realized how small the restaurant was. We took two seats at the sushi bar and had our drink order taken and brought to us promptly along with a side of wasabi and ginger.  Chad recommended we both go for the All You Can Eat special and that's just what we did. It was hard to keep track of all the different things he was ordering, so I gave the menu a quick glance over and went for some items that had ingredients I could recognize such as beef, teriyaki, or spicy tuna.  All in all, together we ordered the Tuna Tostada appetizer, spicy tuna sushi, teriyaki beef roll, 3-10 Roll, D-A Roll, sashimi roll, dynamite appetizer, the deep fried oyster, and green tea mochi. There may have been one or two other items I neglected to note that Chad ordered, but you'll have to excuse my memory as it was foggied by the sushi koma I experienced after dinner.  The highlights for me were the D-A Roll and the 3-10 roll. I've learned that any kind of baked sushi topped with yum yum or eel sauce is right up my alley. I was also pleased to note that they do not skimp on the proteins in terms of the content of each piece of sushi. I have been to places where the sushi mostly just consists of rice and a little smidgen of crab, shrimp, or what have you.  For $26 Sushi Koma is as good a place as any to gloriously stuff your face with premium sushi.",

Good work, 5 points to you sir. There was a roll covered in sauce and was a bit fried that was delicious! Ugh angry I forgot the name. Other rolls I tried was okay, the reason I loved this place is cause our server was the shit, so were the guys behind the sushi bar, a fun experience. And that sushi roll was sooo good. I wouldn't of acted so publicly intoxicated if it wasn't for the fact we were the only people there at the time because it was three in the afternoon. Winning.",

All their staff are so wonderful and made our dining experience so much better than any other AYCE sushi place.  Unlike other AYCE sushi places where food seemed to degrade with time, the food at Sushi Koma continues to be fresh and delicious. I have tried other new AYCE sushi places but nothing came close. If SK continues to serve great food and the service stays the same, I will promise not to stray again :-)",

    "text": "This is my go-to sushi place. Since they are open late I try to go during a later hour when it won't be too busy. It is a small place so it could quickly go on a wait. I always do the AYCE (all you can eat) and it is always worth it.   This place has one of the best appetizers selections for an AYCE place. I am very picky about my seaweed salad, but it is always delicious. The baked green mussels aren't my favorite since I prefer a little more dressing on it but they are still delicious. I was hesitant to try the seafood tostada but I am so glad I did. It is definitely one of my favorite appetizers here along with the tuna carpaccio. The nigiri selection is always good, sometimes better. White tuna and scallops are my favorite. I don't tend to do a lot of sushi rolls but the tiger roll and the ninja roll are the ones I usually get and both are great.   I am really picky about customer service and tend to criticize other servers unfairly. There have been several times where I have to get the attention of a server because part of my order is forgotten. They are usually good with refills. They usually take an unusually long time dropping the check and processing the payment.   There is always room for improvement but I obviously like this place enough to give it four stars and attend it frequently.",

It's a small sushi spot, so expect a wait if you ever come for the weekend prime times. If you can hold out, FUN TIP, they are open until 3AM. I recommend the Big B Roll, it's a sushi roll with the best beef on top, and it's only one per person so make everyone else order one of their own- don't share!!! It's way to good. Highly recommend any of their spicy rolls for those who need a kick, super delicious and will crave that spicy fill. I love the Kimmy Roll! Their tuna, and salmon nigiri is soooo fresh. Absolutely love! Back to spicy... I love the spicy tuna hand roll! It's actually spicy tuna and not the silly fillers like cucumbers and too much rice.  If you're a drinker their house hot sake is perfect in between rolls. I love it when it's super hot. It's one of the better hot sakes where it doesn't have that bitter after taste.  Needless to say I love this place and all the people that make it special. :)",

    "text": "I have been coming to this place since before it even became sushi koma. It was Brian's beach when I fell in love with their menu. The food is great and even though the place itself used to be incredibly small it was always a good experience. Today I went there to celebrate my birthday with a friend and our kids. And the service we received was the absolute worst I have ever experienced in all the years I've been there. We started off with a male waiter who had a tendency to be in mid step away every time you spoke. But ok I could forgive that maybe he's just really busy even though there were only like 4 other tables in there. But I let that slide. I even let the dirty glass thing slide since mistakes happen and was easily fixed. But then we received our food but after 10 minutes of waiting I had to ask the waiter for the rice that was supposed to come with the kids food. He brought it quickly but dropped it off without a word and walked away. I tried multiple times to flag him down for various things but he never came back. Apparently mid service we switched waiters but no one ever said anything to us. Suddenly a girl started checking up on us. She was attentive but we had basically ordered everything we needed from our previous waiter so it was just a matter of waiting. We only had one item left and knew that it would take some time since it was a baked roll but after 30 minutes of waiting and being ignored we finally decided to get up and wait for our check at the podium.  At which point the male waiter came back to ring us up. Not one word of a greeting or how was everything; he simply just set the bill in front and waited to finish the transaction. I have never been so disappointed in a service of place I love so much. I love the food and the previous experiences so I may come back to try again but I will never allow that waiter to serve me again. Working in the service industry I know that is not the way you treat people.",

The tuna carpaccio was almost fully cooked and covered with burnt garlic. The amount of tuna served was smaller than my pinky finger, though it's supposed to be a $10 dish. I'm not the biggest eater yet I ate easily over $100 worth of sushi (got the AYCE) and still walked hungry. That's how embarrassingly small the serving sizes are.",

The fish is definitely on the fresher side.  As a person who tends to order a lot of nigiri vs rolls, the quality of the cuts of fish has consistently stayed at a high quality.  Favorite Nigiri Tuna White Tuna Red Snapper Mackerel  Favorite Rolls Big B roll DA Roll Pania Roll Spider Roll SSS Roll  Favorite Apps Shrimp Tempura Teriyaki Beef Seared Tuna Carpaccio Seafood Tostada  Service is top notch from both the Servers and the Sushi Chefs.  They are attentive and always check on you.  If I had to nit pick on anything, the fried calamari isn't season, so you would definitely have to dip it in the sauce provided with it, or with some soy sauce.  Occasionally, there would be either a mix up of orders, or they forgot something.  It doesn't bother me.   All you have to do is tell them, and they will get you what you want right away.  The restaurant is small, but the ambiance is great.  Just gotta be aware if you are bringing a bigger group.  Also advise that you order the bake rolls at the beginning since they take time.  Overall I highly recommend Sushi Koma!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I visit LV every 1-2 years and always have at least one meal with sushi. Growing up and having lived in Hawaii for most of our lives, we know what good sushi is and are often disappointed...but not this time!  We were in LV the first week of July and my husband searched for sushi restaurants on Yelp. This restaurant is nowhere near the strip, but it isn't a very long drive, either. We got there at about 10:00 PM after we went to a show. It's located in a small shopping center with a large parking lot.   Although the space is small, it is just right. We were warmly greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. The seating is very close, but somehow it all works. For those who prefer, there is seating at the sushi bar.   They have a large and varied menu, and we went for the all you can eat. We didn't eat as much as we normally do since it was a little late, but what we had was excellent! Very fresh fish and the proportion of fish to rice is perfect. No skimpy pieces of fish here.   Something that weighs heavily on our decision to return to a restaurant is the service and Sushi Koma has top notch service. The wait staff continuously checked on us, cleared dishes and asked if we'd like to order more. We didn't even know who our \"waitress\" was because they all worked as a team and waited on all the tables. I give kudos to the staff and management for this. And they were all relatively \"younger\" and extremely pleasant and friendly. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being there.   Needless to say, we will be eating here on our subsequent visits to LV and will recommend it to others. I highly recommend Sushi Koma!",

    "text": "This is probably my newest favorite place for sushi! I didn't know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised! Their rolls were not over stuffed with rice and from what I had the nigri was super fresh. We sat in front of the owner and he kept our food coming steadily. He actually was making things for my husband, like the mackerel or the super white tuna, which both these items he generally doesn't like but liked it at Sushi Freak! I love that he added sea salt and lemon to the octopus and he did the same with the scallops!   Service was awesome! The 3 ladies working there were very attentive and so were the sushi chefs. I definitely will be back and they have a great assortment of rolls that a pregnant lady, like me can eat that doesn't have tuna or raw fish! Definitely a place to go for AYCE great sushi!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try a new AYCE sushi place. We brought our 2 year old daughter along who loves going out to sushi with us. Waitress seats us and only brings out a water for my boyfriend and I and not our daughter. Whenever we go out to AYCE we order our daughter an order of gyoza and edamame and that it more than enough for her.  Waitress informed us that we were not able to share the gyoza we ordered and give it to our TWO YEAR OLD daughter. I was really disappointed because we have brought our daughter to OYSHI where the chef's make her her own special dish.   We came in at 3:22 so we were charged dinner price, as well as an extra $7 for the gyoza for my daughter. The restaurant was dead so I cannot judge the service quality because there were only two other customers besides us. The waitress asked us if we were splitting checks before we were even ordered any food which was rude in my opinion.   The sushi was okay. The restaurant did not WOW me. I will not return knowing that other sushi places I have gone to are much better accommodating to my TWO year old daughter. The restaurant just seemed so cheap to me that they weren't willing to have my daughter eat 4 pieces of gyoza off of my order?",

We opted for the dinner special menu instead of the all-you-can-eat or sushi al a carte. I'm a big fan of sushi dinner specials because you can usually get a roll, miso soup, rice, a meat of some sort (chicken, fish, etc.), tempura, and appetizers (gyoza, egg roll). For $14 you really can't go wrong if you're on a budget. We had so much food, we had to take it home.   The food was fantastic. I got the teriyaki chicken special: chicken, white rice, miso soup, 1 gyoza, 1 egg roll, 6 pieces veggie tempura, and a 6 piece california roll. OMG so much food!!!   I especially loved the gyoza! A lot of places I've been will have these super greasy, but these weren't at all.   Def. coming back here!",

This is the closest sushi place to where I live and I used to always want to come here, but the last trip I had here was awful. For such a small location and for as many servers as they had, I could not get anyones attention to initially order. We got AYCE and throughout the night we only received about 3/4 of what we ordered. There was a point where no servers were out on the floor and every table was filled, but no food had come out for 10 minutes. I assumed a mix up happened in the back, and when the food finally came out, we received the wrong rolls and had to wait for our rolls to be remade because they were given to another table and had already been eaten from. I ordered shrimp tempura about 3 times until I received it, after we ordered dessert. Lol.  I hadn't gone back since. The taste and quality is pretty good, but since my last visit I realized there are better sushi places worth trying.",

Owner should sell the sauce for this on the side it's really good... their green tea needs to be brewed longer or next time I'll just order water. I like their fish paradise, love the garlic ponzu sauce. Hopefully, they will get better at washing dishes, otherwise customer service is good from waitresses, (sushi chefs need to be friendlier) owner is about and available and the sushi is good for the price.

Top 5 definitely, but the last couple of times I've come here with my sister I've ordered AYCE and she's done a-la-carte and they have been watching us like hawks. It made me very uncomfortable. I'm not sure if they think we were trying to get away with eating cheaper or what the case was? Either way, it took us 20 minutes to order our food and a table that arrived 10 minutes after us were greeted first. Over all, I love the food here but as far as service goes I'm sure I could find much better at other Sushi bars. I'm giving it 4 stars because the tuna carpaccio and Cajun albacore is amazing but if it wasn't for that it would probably be 2 stars.",

The owner is super nice and everybody in there has a smile and encourages you to try different things. Not only that, they make sure they cater to exactly what you want. If you mention you don't like green onions on top of your sushi, then that'll be the last time you ever see it on top.... No need to remind them like at several sushi places I've been to. They really care about their customers here and that's a big deal for me. On a side note, the owner had said that they might change the name to something other than sushi freak soon... Also it's a bit small in there but I can care less bc their sushi and service is A+++++++ haha.",

I thought the ayce was really good even though there is not as much selection as goyemon, but the quality of the fish was good and thats what really matters.  I do wish that some items were not a one time only.  i understand the uni and sweet shrimp, but the ice cream and tuna carpaccio.  I love the fact that it wasn't overly busy and I didn't have to wait over an hour to be seated.  I will be coming back here due to the fresh tasting fish and friendly staff.",

There was a ton of specialty rolls, so much variety, but I am disappointed they didn't have any with fruit in them (which I've had at other sushi places similar to here). We were all surprised at the high quality of the nigiri, not smelly or fishy. We might have ordered rounds of every one for everybody. And we probably collectively tried all the rolls. The baked/fried rolls were the least pleasing to me because they looked a lot like a big mess, but I would try anything else. I only wish dessert was also unlimited. Wouldn't object to returning.",

Service was outstanding, got lots of great reccomendations and even some off the menu items. Their special cold sake went great with the sushi. Truly a great combination. Fish was very fresh and rolls were a good size, not too big or too small and definitely well packed in the roll.  Overall a five star experience for the low price of $25 for ayce!! Try it!!!",

The only bright spots were the nigiri...everything else was blah.  The restaurant is also really small and they pack it to the max.  They even stole two of our chairs during the meal to pack it even further.   This place is awesome if you like refugee-camp-style dining!  They really need to get a bigger space (and a new sign--it still says Brian's Beach Sushi).  Also, the service is fast and attentive but I couldn't take a bite without a server asking me how I was doing.  I felt like screaming \"thank you, but for the love of god leave me alone!\"  The serving tempo was so intense that I felt like everyone was having some kind of manic episode.    For me, the nigiri is the only reason to go back.  Otherwise, I'll pass.",

    "text": "Sushi Freak is the new Brian's Beach.  After the Elite event at the Barrymore, Steve W. suggested that some of us go eat some more at the newly 're-opened' Sushi Freak.  NIGIRI: Not my ideal fish-rice ratio. But hey! Not bad! Large slices of fresh, fresh fish on medium size rice nuggets. All my usual fishies tasted delicious and the uni wasn't bad. Not exceptional! But satisfactory.  VARIETY: I skip out on rolls. But I do help myself to appetizers and unusual dishes.  The tuna \"carpaccio\" was amazing. Seared tuna drizzled with some type of mouth-watering sauce. I could've scarfed down a few plates of this. And God knows I love a good tuna tartare. The deep-fried crisps they were served on were fresh, flaky, and delicious. The stack of fried dough and tuna was a beast to eat. But just dig in; this is AYCE sushi, not a fine-dining establishment.  SERVICE: Some of the best service can be found at small sushi restaurants and Sushi Freak is no exception. Steve so happened to be SF VIP so the chef prepared some special dishes and came out to speak to us personally. The girls serving our table were sweet-natured and fairly attentive. There were 7-8 of us and they had no problem splitting checks. Nothing turns me off more than restaurants that have issues tending to groups.   Sushi Freak is yet another addition to my list of favorite AYCE sushi restaurants. The owner was so polite and wanted to make sure that we were all happy. He apologized  for any drag on service but assured us that they will do everything they can to keep us satisfied. These people are good people. And they serve up some mean sushi as well.",

Some of the REALLY good stuff is only one per person sadly.  The Tuna Carpaccio is just really good. It's the baked/fried slivers of garlic that kick it up a notch.   The various items we ordered were all pretty good but i cant judge them on just this one time considering inventory and stock and freshness of the fish.

    "text": "Came here because of a friend's recommendation. I was debating between Goyemon Sushi House (my AYCE go-to place) or trying this new place, and I'm SO HAPPY that I took a leap of faith of trying Sushi Freak.   The quality of the fish here is amazing. Hamachi (yellowtail) was the first thing that came  to our table and we're instantly impressed with the taste of the fish and the unique way they \"modify\" their regular sushi. Same thing on pretty much everything else we had eaten that night (saba, albacore, ikura, etc).  I love Uni (sea urchin) and Amaebi (sweet shrimp) and most restaurants have similar decent taste/quality in these two, but WOW the ones I had at Sushi Freak is way better than I've ever had--They're generous on the amount of uni they put on sushi, and the sweet shrimp was so fresh and tasted lively and was actually sweet. Because of this i'm hooked to Sushi Freak for good and i'm happy about it.   Couple other things to note:  1) Our server, Judy, was excellent in doing her job; she recommended great dishes, greet people real nicely as they step out, very sweet and friendly. She was part of why our Sushi night out was so wonderful, and I really appreciate that because i'm tired of the \"server checking on you for what you have leftover\" attitude seen everywhere else.   2) I have to mention that not only our server was great, the rest of the staff members were very nice and timely in pouring us tea and cleaning our dishes. The chefs at the bar were cool too.  3) The head chef/owner actually came out to introduce a dish he had created (seafood Tostadas) and taught us how to eat it, and we were impressed about the dish and how he actually cares.   4) Loved the Tuna carpaccio appetizer. Very flavorful.   5) The server said they open till 3AM and they receive daily shipment of fish.  I'll be back with more people for sure.",

They also offer unique AYCE items, such as their sashimi roll which is wrapped in a daikon radish filled w/ various fish (very delicate & delicious), tuna capriccio seared tuna with a garlic chips and a ponzu style sauce, and of course their ono nigiri.  Perfectly sized on a not so big mound of sushi rice!  They also have the typical AYCE desserts to clean your palate from your SUSHI eating fest, such as mochi ice cream, plum wine, red bean, and green tea!  I would definitely come back because I love supporting my locals and who doesn't love a quality product served with a smile!",

The appetizers were amazing (tuna tartar, gyoza- extra crispy, shrimp tempura, edamame and seaweed salad). I was not a fan of the fried oysters, because the breading was too thick. For sushi, we tried yellow tail, uni, white tuna, sweet shrimp, salmon and some rolls. Sushi Koma did not disappoint when it comes to the freshness of their sushi, as well as the proportion of protein to rice. I am not a fan of unagi, but loved how crispy sushi koma's version is.   Staff were attentive, kept up with our orders and did not mind how many splits the check was. I'll be back for more!!",

Our server forgot our order (sake), took Forever for refills and forget about the check we have to walk to the front to get acknowledged.    We cut our meal short due to the experience.  We told one of the servers and he stated it was because of short staff the service was bad.  Funny thing is its the same amount of staff in the old location. Really disappointing experience today.",

This is normally good you won't have to wait and let others finish to be seated however the exact opposite happened. The place was severely under staffed and took us over half hour to be seated. Since I knew the sushi was worth it here I wasn't too upset about it. I genuinely felt bad because of the understaffed crew also had to deal with flooding from I believe the bathroom. Kind of gross but we all have terrible days. None of this would hinder me from not coming back.",

Finally a really nice waitress came and took our order and we got our food pretty fast. We than ordered dessert and waited at least 25 minutes and realized she didn't even put the order in and had to ask again. Honestly was really disappointed in the service.

Came by on Thursday night and their original location is closed up with paper signs all over the doors and windows.  They have moved to the other side of the same shopping center but closer to Durango behind the JITB.  Yes service is slow because this is their 2nd night and there are always unforeseen things that happen like the surge rush of people around 7PM that pretty much filled it all up at once.  The food and menu are all the same but they just need time to work out the kinks.  Give them a chance and please if you review,  Keep that in mind.",

They call it sushi koma because you leave feeling like you're going into a coma after all the yummy food you eat :) TRY it all if you can! Better to go in a group so you can share and try it all.",

Three parties of 3,2, and 5 were sat down before us and they didn't receive their first order until AFTER us. Five employees were at the sushi bar but they were not moving fast and taking their time as slow as possible. I work in the restaurant business as a cook and I know for damn sure that when it's as packed as this place was that you DO NOT have time to jump off the line and come back with a drink.  Despicable. They were better when they had the smaller store, it actually forced them to pump out orders to get people in and out. The wait staff was the only good part. Shoutout to Ben, Melissa, Viviana, and Daryl. Thanks guys for doing the best you could do for us!!!",

Went there for the AYCE and the price was very reasonable for $25.  All of the different sushi I tried was delicious, I ate way too much and was stuffed beyond belief.  The wait staff was very friendly and constantly checked on us to ensure everything was good and that our drinks were always filled.  But what made it extra special was the chef giving us a complimentary plate of toro sashimi!!!! OMG that was so amazing.  So sweet and melted in my mouth.  Now I know that's not to be expected or anything but it was a shock when the server brought it over and man I loved every piece.    The decor was very modern and the restaurant was nice and clean.  You better believe we will be back here again for the AYCE sushi.  Honestly I've spent more than $50 easily at a regular sushi restaurant so this is a great deal and obviously you can't leave here and still be hungry.  Actually we overate and our stomach was hurting from eating too much!    Highly recommend it and next time I'll take pics hehe",

    "text": "AYCE Sushi Koma!  Sushi Koma has a huge variety of fresh, baked, fried, and non fish sushi along with appetizers, rolls, hand rolls and nigiri. If you love non traditional rolls, this is the place for you! Half the menu is dedicated to non traditional rolls. If you love fresh nigiri, this is also the place for you!   The fish for nigiri is the most fresh out of all the items on the menu and from trying most of the nigiri on the menu, my boyfriend and I ordered the white tuna, salmon, scallop and yellow tail multiple times. White tuna was definitely our favorite from the regular items.   We went in for lunch and went for the dinner pricing to try the uni and sweet shrimp and boy it was well worth the extra 5 dollars pp! You get 1 order per person and each order comes with 2 pieces and the portion of the uni is well above average and amazingly fresh!! I will come back here just for the uni! The sweet shrimp is also very fresh and creamy, I'm not one who craves sweet shrimp but it's definitely a great addition to the dinner menu.  Service is good, food is good and loved the ambience of this cute spacious restaurant. A legitimately 4/5 star AYCE sushi restaurant.",

    "text": "Three years later and this is still my go-to spot of AYCE sushi!  I've recently come here with my husband and a friend, and I guess it's been some time since I visited. They changed their location to a bigger spot but it is in the same shopping plaza. There is so much more room for more people to sit and enjoy themselves, which I was so excited for. It shows that Sushi Koma is doing really well after all these years. I loved the ambiance and the theme they have put together.   As always, the food was BOMB! I love their sushi here as Sushi Koma. We always order our go-to rolls: kappa-maki, caterpillar, dragon and teriyaki beef roll but we tried a few new ones this time. We tried the Bank Roll, Sashimi roll, Jane roll and an appetizer that I thought was interesting: Brie with Grape quesadilla. All these rolls were so good! Now, I know the quesadilla sounds weird but it was really good - very light in flavor and not too cheesy and neither is it very sweet from the grapes. You have to try these!  The downside I think during this visit was our green muscles! OK. They were pretty burnt but they were served to us anyway. There was some mayo on the first 2 and then the rest after it was dark and dry. The mayo/sauce was practically burnt off. =(  The service here was awesome. It did seem like we cycled through 3 different servers somehow, but they were all really nice and accommodating. We also happened to get miso soup and a seaweed salad served to us even though we didn't order it. We still ate it and appreciated it. =x   I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Atmosphere was great. Service was great. Sushi not so much, especially for the price. I ordered: salmon nigiri, tuna carpaccio, spicy crab hand roll, salmon avocado hand roll, Sam's volcano roll, dq roll, ninja roll, washington roll, kimmy special roll, and baked mussels.  There were lemon seeds in the thick cut lemons that were placed on the salmon nigiri. Pretty sure they were just lemons for the water cups twisted and placed on top. I had to pick out 4 seeds before eating the fish.  The tuna carpaccio is the only thing that was pretty decent. The flavor was good and the garlic on top was a nice addition.  The 2 hand rolls were small. Cucumber inside was very big and less fish inside than there is supposed to be. You could call them finger rolls, not hand rolls.  The ninja roll and kimmy special roll were very very dry and bland. We paid for them and did not finish them or take them home. Very strange that Kimmy special had a heart by it, it was our least favorite because of the dryness and how hard and flavorless it was.  The mussels were so so so super fishy they tasted like they came straight out of a fisherman's bucket. We apologized for not being able to eat them and did not ask for a remake. They were clearly bad.   I have other small complaints about the food in general but it's not necessary. The service was good enough. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us plenty. The food was just not worth it and we left unsatisfied and turned off by sushi which sucked because we are obsessed with sushi. Will maybe consider giving this place another try and updating my review in the future. Probably not though.",

    "text": "Ever since moving to Las Vegas in 2014, it's been a quest to find the best sushi restaurant in town. Many people look for different things when it comes to sushi but I could say my range is pretty wide when it comes to food I like or am willing to try. With that said, and after dining here 20+ times, it's safe to say that this is the sushi joint you want to go to. It's not loud and clanky inside, the music is unique and adds to this cool and artsy atmosphere the decor and lighting promote. The quality of food never disappoints and the staff is very personable.  There's much to be said about the difference between Customer Service and Customer Experience. Here, I appreciate that I don't feel invisible. The owner always says hello when we stop by, I always feel welcome and the waitresses are on top of their stuff. Sometimes we encounter someone who is new on the job who may not know everything we may be asking for but their coworkers have their back and it's dope to see some teamwork and support.  Anyway, to Chris and everyone at Koma. Thanks so much for the awesome experiences time and time again. See you soon!  - Chris / Austin",

From flavored Sake to Brie & grape quesadillas.  My fiance and I came here for the AYCE because they do half rolls. Although, there are things on the menu that are only one per person. We tried each of those dishes and didn't feel the need to order a second round.   We started off with garlic tuna, salmon and Cajun albacore. The fish was very fresh, high quality. We had every intention of getting a second round but ended up filling up on as we worked our way through appetizers and rolls.",

Our rolls came out and everything was fresh and served in generous amounts which was amazing.  I started eating my rolls and I don't know if I was having an off day or I didn't like the type of crab that they used.  I couldn't figure it out but It was hard for me to get down which was disappointing. I think maybe the crab was either too salty or too bland. Idk.,I really couldn't figure it out so I need to give this place another try sometime to give a better review.",

Our gave us plenty of suggestions to try on their menu. She was so upbeat and really energetic! We definitely enjoyed the energy of the place.  We enjoyed that you can get split orders. So you can have half orders. The appetizers were so incredibly delicious. We ordered the shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried oysters and shrimp and beef carpaccio.   Then of course, we ordered a plethora of sushi. One important bit of info is that if you do not finish your food, you can actually get charged extra. So pace yourself and dont over do it.

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of AYCE sushi. Eating to the point of that feeling of being over stuffed just doesn't appeal to me but tonight I caved. My stomach was craving everything and at a place like Sushi Koma you can't easily narrow down your selection especially if you're a party of 1. Best part, they allow half rolls so if you are tossed between a few choices just choose them all, half style!   For the ones who knew this place awhile back, it was a small cozy little spot which probably held about 30 people, tops. Although I like that the new spot, still within in the same shopping complex, is a great, trendy and a lot larger! Although they have expanded, quality and service still remain. Go check it out for yourself!",

I have never been to a sushi bar that doesn't accomadate customer lifestyle requests. Then we ordered the all you can eat and they only had nigiri. So we just ate the meat and after the plates were taken away she informs us that we will get a $10 charge foe not eating the rice. What!  Do this place want to stay in business? The food was good but certainly not near the best. The atmosphere is loud and service takes a while.  Not a recommended place from me.",

Atmosphere is good, a little crowded and loud, but I learned to enjoy that type of environment after visiting Japan. (not that there's a direct relationship with atmospheres, it's just something I learned to appreciate) The art around the restaurant is dope btw. The servers are very social and accommodating.  This is Random but I don't know why they have a table and chair in their bathrooms lol.   My favorite roll is the Tiger Roll.  I appreciate the Jalepeno and Ponzu drop, on the Hamachi Nigiri and there AYCE options are great.   This place is a good choice.",

Now normally I would say if I spent that long in a restaurant it was a great experience, not the case here as we spent most of the 2 hours here WAITING for our sushi. The 3 of us ordered cucumber salad and that showed up after 2 rolls and my order of gyoza. Ok fine, whatever, it came out decently quick considering they were busy, but then we didn't see our server for basically the rest of the time we were there and were left waiting for our other 4 rolls we had ordered. The owner came around and asked how we were doing, told her we were STILL waiting on rolls and that our server hadn't checked on us in about 40 min. She apologized and expedited the rest of our order. We get our checks and even that took a good 10 min to do. I think the entire restaurant got flipped by the time we left. Absolutely ridiculous.",

Accommodating with the rolls on AYCE, we couldn't decide between a fresh/deep fried version of the same roll, so the server recommended we get half of each and try both!  Great selection of Sake as well, I would recommend trying the sake sampler. Our favorite was the strawberry.",

It is a small little place, and may feel cramped if it's gets really busy. You don't really have a designated server, but it's always been a good thing. Our water is never empty, they always check to see what else you need (I do AYCE and do a little at a time), and the food always comes fast. The menu is easy to read. All in all, it's one of the better local neighborhood AYCE sushi spots. NOW, MIND YOU... this is not a Michelin star place on the strip, so don't expect that kind of food. It is good for what it's suppose to be.",

We go to a lot of AYCE sushi places and we thought that it would be like the others, you sit at the bar and you get the interaction .... Nope.  We ordered appetizers but then waited at least 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the sushi chef.  Was it because they only had 1 chef for 3 tables and a couple at the sushi bar?  It was a bit if a turn off.   Some redeeming qualities that will make me come back: music selection, quaint little space and close to home.  I may need to return now that I know what to expect.  Maybe sit at one of the tables and then order a ton of sushi so we don't wait so long ...  We'll see...",

This is probably the worst AYCE sushi joint in town, the waiter was not attentive at all and didn't seem to care. After he took our first order he never came back around to ask how we're doing or need to order anything else, we would have to flag someone down everytime if we needed something. As simple as ginger slices and wasabi it took us asking 2 different waiter/waitresses for them to finally bring it to us after about 45 mins getting our food. On top of that food quality is really bad, the rice is so undercooked and it would fall apart. Some of the dishes taste way too salty. Even the desert was bad, I mean how can you go wrong with desert? Their mochi didn't have the Q texture at all even after we let it sit for a few mins usually the mochi thaw out but this one remained hard texture. We didn't even finish our desert. Overall very very disappointed.",

Only downside was seating...while we were there some ladies went to sit down and touched a table and the soy bottle hit the floor and broke. Next the waiter removed my dipping sauce bowl and dropped it off the small table and it shattered with sauce everywhere, including our legs.. As we finished..our table leg broke and in slow motion i see the soy bottle falling, hold out my foot to break the fall, it worked but soy sauce shot up my other leg. We walked out laughing, looked like we had a sushi food fight!  This place should have 5 stars for food quality and service, but need to upgrade dining area.

You can definately taste the difference in freshness on your tongue from here than other places. I've gone to pricey sushi spots to inexpensive and this place is the bomb. And they open late until like 3am!?! Sweet! The sushi chefs are all very nice people. Our one server is quick and always on it shes been there awhile idk her name. Lately theres been new faces server wise and they are a bit slow & ditsy but im sure they'll catch up. Small small place with a dim romantic ambience, always packed! Sometimes we don't even get in because the wait is long but i still Love it! Hehe =]",

I would definitely recommend this spot to my friends and visitors to town looking for a locals spot off the strip.",

I asked for ice that took 5 minutes to get for my warm beer. Ordered edamame and nigiri for appetizers.....30 minutes later edamame arrives....30 minutes after that sushi arrives. The table next to us was there 2&1/2 hours and never got there whole order before they left. We were so disgusted with the service got up and asked the server to charge us for the stuff we ate. And yes he did charge us. I work in the service industry and that 2 items we ordered would've been comped.   We left and went to rainbow sushi. Got stuffed in less than an hour. I wanted to try something different today but ended up with the worst service ever. I just read the reviews before I started writing this and someone had the same experience about waiting every 30 minutes for each dish.",

    "text": "I'll admit that the size of their fish reduced over time but their service is still top notch. I came here with my bf to celebrate his birthday. It was a Friday night and obviously busy. We sat on the sushi bar, close to the door so we get cold whenever people come and go but we were so hungry that we didn't want to wait for a table. My first visit here was when they first opened, and I remember how their nigiri sizes used to be. So yes, I'm a little disappointed that over time they resorted to decreasing their fish size but we're also talking business here, so I understand. I still love their baked mussels and that tostada and their albacore, amaebi, and white tuna was waaay too freaking fresh. I was a bit sad that their dessert menu is minuscule compared to other AYCE places. So far, two stars are taken off. But their customer service is simply the best I've had in a while and that alone gains this place a solid star. Their servers (and even the sushi chefs) were attentive and friendly towards the customers. Our drinks were always refilled and they never fail to keep coming back to ask us our orders. I hope they get a chance to expand some day. Their location is pretty small and that's one of the main reason I don't come here as much as I want... I'm a bit claustrophobic.",

    "text": "Koma is my regular sushi spot when I get that sushi craving, which is quite often. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review, but here we go.  First of all the best part about Sushi Koma is the customer service. All the chefs and waitresses are really attentive even when the place is packed. I have experienced very few mishaps here and that is always a positive thing. There are quite a few places where the food is great, but the service ranges from mediocre to bad, but Koma isn't one of those places.  While the service is great, I'm not about to forget the food. The nigiri ranging from my favorites like surf clam and octopus to yellow tail and salmon, are always fresh. I have yet to have a bad experience with any of those offerings. The only nitpick I have is that the lemon slices on the salmon are a bit too thick at times.  The appetizers are also really good, but unfortunately are mostly limited to one order for each all you can eat. I recommend the seared tuna carpaccio and the mussels, though the sashimi roll is also pretty good.  Finally onto the rolls. The rolls are just as good as the nigiri, though I feel this is where koma is the weakest. The variety of rolls isn't as big or as diverse as some other places. I usually end up sticking to a few of their rolls and after a while it gets a bit old. Hopefully they eventually experiment a bit more and try adding a few more different rolls. Maybe as a daily special menu or something.  Overall though you can't go wrong with Koma.",

Thankfully we've been here only on slower times, but there is no way you can comfortably get 50+ people in this little space.

This place has a wonderful selection of good quality sushi, I was very impressed.    The chefs are great and quick, the wait staff are really nice and always filling your drinks they seem to treat you like family.  The owner was working behind the sushi bar and we started talking he was one of the chefs who opened one of the large sushi places on the strip he followed his dream and opened his own place Sushi Freak.    He has little twists on a lot of what we ordered some had a touch of sauce or a little something special on them, the rolls are good and you can get a half roll so you can break up the meal.  He has a lot of experience designing and creating some great dishes my favorite of the night was the Tuna Carpaccio YUM!  He was extremely generous and no qualms about you eating your fill and even offers more once you are full.  So for an all you can eat sushi I will definitely be back for seconds and thirds...  Next time I think we are going to let him decide what we eat and just try some of his creations!",

    "text": "My friend came up from Hendertucky to have sushi at Brian's Beach, but as several other reviews mentioned, the place has changed hands.  The sign outside just says \"SUSHI\" with a banner above saying \"Grand Opening.\"  She loved Brian's Beach (I had never been) so we were a bit skeptical but decided to give Sushi Freak a try.  I'm so glad this place is not even a mile from home!  And open until 3am every night!  The place is small, bordering on very small, but not too busy at 7pm on a Thursday.  Only 6 tables and about 10 spots at the sushi bar.  We noticed half of the diners were Asian so figured this must be good stuff!  The menu was kept very close to Brian's; our server said it was to honor the previous owner.  I did the AYCE and my friend started a la carte, but was hungry enough for to switch over to AYCE; our server was very accommodating.    I guess edamame was an appetizer before, but it was served after we sat. From yelpers' recommendations I started with the Poki Tower, and I had to try their Dynamite.  I've never had a Poki Tower, so I can't compare it to anything, but the flavor was amazing!  The mix of ingredients and spices was awesome! It looked like pico de gallo, but that was the only similarity.  The Dynamite was also very good.  I like Sushi Kaya's more, but Sushi Freak's was still good.  I did half rolls for everything else (only available with AYCE) and had too many to remember.  The Stephanie, SSS, Almost Fire, Big B, Tiger, Alex's Muncie, were all very good.  The other two I had were also good, but I just can't remember their names!  I blame my Sushi Coma.  The service was great from the greetings as we entered, to their suggestions (including things off their unpublished menu), and to the chef making a special roll for my friend who wanted something \"ridiculously spicy.\" (It was spicy, but not ridiculously.)    Our only complaints, albeit minor, is their spicy items are not that spicy and as small as the place is there will be long waits.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times and last night was disappointing to me. When me and my girlfriend arrived, we were greeted by our server (I don't remember her name) she was nice enough except after we told her we needed a minute to look at the menu for AYCE she disappeared, another guy working there noticed us and asked if we were being helped, I said we were but I did not know where our server went (she had been gone for some time, I even asked my girlfriend to make sure I wasn't over reacting and she agreed). He took our orders and after a few moments later our original server had made a reappearance to ask if we were ready to order, I informed her we already did with someone else. After a little while our food starting being delivered but I had also ordered a bottle of sake which never got delivered until I asked for it a 2nd time. At this point and my girlfriend and I were eating and the chef kept handing us our orders directly, he was being somewhat rude about it saying in a annoyed tone \"hello?? here you go\". I WAS EATING!! Can you imagine how annoying it is to be in the middle of eating and some guy is giving you an attitude cause your not grabbing your food fast enough from him??Me and my girlfriend were sitting at the bar area in front of the chefs so I know I'm rite there but that doesn't mean I should be serving myself (if you sat at the bar at a P.T's they wouldn't expect you to pour your own beer or make your own shots). If my girlfriend wasn't with me I probably would have said some choice words about there service rite then and there but I didn't want to make a scene so I kept my mouth shut. At this point I was a bit annoyed but I wanted to have a good night so I tried to let it go, then the chef with an attitude starts handing me stuff I didn't even order! Like what dude you expect me to go run it to the table?? Their Sushi is great but their service is lacking, think I'll be going to another Sushi place from now on.",

    "text": "I hadn't heard of Sushi Koma until it was recommended by a friend, so I decided to try it out.  My first impressions were that it was small, well decorated and had friendly staff.  Most AYCE sushi places I have been to in Vegas have been small or medium in size but I think this was the smallest one yet. Most of the tables are smaller than normal, so I wouldn't order TOO much food at one time.  There are 2 tables that are bigger that were meant for groups and most of the tables are set up for 2 people or 4 when you combine them.  I liked the feeling in there and the decorations and art on the walls gave a nice feeling to the place. The sushi here is solid. There were a couple rolls that I really liked(PB Roll, shashimi roll) and a few that were your standard AYCE type of rolls. The thing I liked about their menu was how they a large 'spicy roll' section because I love spicy sushi. They also had a section of sushi rolls for 'non-raw fish' which I thought was a good idea because I know many people who don't or won't eat any raw fish.  One drawback was they had 1 per person limits on a few more items than usual. Their baked mussels were very good and I very much so wanted to order more but just one per person. For dessert you also get just one item and so I went with the coffee mochi.  It was pretty good, not the best mochi I've ever had but it was nice. My buddy got ice cream that he said was freaking amazing. I apologize I don't remember the name of it but he doesn't even like ice cream so that speaks to something since he actually liked it. Sushi Koma is a small place with a good atmosphere, good sushi and really good service. I will be back here again even with all of the AYCE sushi competition in town",

In other words, the food comes out in a timely fashion. But most importantly, the food is abso-freakin-lutely great/yummy/melt-in-your-mouth/omg!  I even want to recommend one of the waitress's personal recommendation: Sam's Volcano Roll. Baked creamy goodness! Simply a must-try. Other recommendations are: Big B Roll, Tiger Roll and Ninja Roll. The Big B Roll comes with thinly sliced beef on top which makes for an interesting combination of flavors and textures. The Tiger Roll has a yummy spicy tuna topper. The Ninja Roll has eel and tempura for crunchiness.  The sushi chefs are especially friendly. It has been my second visit already and I plan to come here regularly!  Thank you.",

    "text": "Mmmm ok. I haven't been here in a looong time. Last time I was here they were in the old location. It's been about a year or so.  We were seated, asked what we wanted to drink and then our order was taken after we got our drinks.  I don't know what happened to my server. It's like she forgot that we are here. Yeah, I'm literally typing this out as I'm eating (or trying to, at least). Anyway, I asked one dude if I could order with him. He said, \"Ummmmm, I can get your server for you.\" And promptly walked away. I think he forgot because he went into the kitchen. Oh maybe he went to find our server in the kitchen? Maybe... We waited... Ten minutes, no one to take our order and no food on the table... Had to get the attention of THREE people just to have our order taken.  I don't remember the service here being so utterly dreadful. In fact, one of the reasons I used to love this place was because of how awesome the service was.  You changed bro.  But hey, at least the sushi is still pretty decent. Even so, the sushi doesn't make up for the complete lack of attention and awareness by the servers.  Not sure what the infrastructure is like here so I won't go too hard but there needs to be some improvements. It's Thursday night and there's 7 groups with each group ranging from 1-4 people. It is FAR from busy. I see six employees walking around. I think 3 are servers and 3 are bussers maybe? Somethings up... I don't know what it could be. Maybe it's just not a good day? I really want to give the benefit of the doubt because I really loved this place in the past.   You know, I used to be a server for two different high volume restaurants. The biggest issue preventing restaurants from running smoothly is employees with disgustingly poor work ethic. If you've ever worked in the service industry, you know what I'm talking about. It's not just  the service industry. It's everywhere.   Anyway... I'm having fun typing this out so I'll end with this. Rating the employees.  Our server, Korean girl, speaks Korean well - 1/5 (not very attentive, absolutely no customer service skills, needs most training)   Busser guy - 2/5 (I don't hate him, seems like a nice guy but I get the vibe he is new)   Latina food runner - 3/5 (she was very nice and probably new)  Girl with tats - She did stop by to pick up plates and fill water and I like her tattoos so I'll give her a 3.5/5.   Patrita - OK. This is actually a turning point. She kind of just came out of no where and started helping us. She went to check on our food. Apologized profusely when it turned out the order was never put in. And has just been very attentive. Even though I'm about done with my meal, I'm glad that at least there's someone willing to take initiative. AND SHE IS PREGNANT. Good on her. 5/5  Short bald guy who I assume is owner aka kkomalul. He was nice enough. Doing his own thing most of the time. Neutral.   Anyway, I'm done now. With my food, that is. I am not sure if I'll ever come back but if I do, its not likely to be my decision.  Edit: One more thing... There was a slow and steady flow of people coming in and going out. You will not be greeted, you will not be thanked. At least not by their own volition. Being a server is a fairly straightforward job. However, I wholly believe that training is required. Regardless of your background. Every restaurant is run differently. Every employee should be trained to maintain a customer service mindset. 100% not something that was evident here. Other than from Patrita.  I may have just come on a bad night. I don't know. I do know that I really did not enjoy my time here tonight, overall.  I rarely do real-time reviews but I had a feeling it was going to be necessary.  Cheers.",

And I've waited until now because it's a small spot and I don't want it to get busier ;)  I've been to lots of other great places - including Umiya, Jjanga, Goyemon, O-my, and Toro.  Sushi Koma is still top of the list (with Goyemon as a close second, and Umiya as a close 3rd).  Their fish to rice ratio is amazing. The seared tuna carpaccio and seafood tostada are insanely good. They've never been out of Uni (unlike Goyemon, which didn't have it). And their servers are insanely fast.",

    "text": "I remember when Sushi Koma was Brian's Beach back in the early 2000's. When I learned there was a new sushi joint in town that had the best uni w/ a tasty quail egg on top, I had to check this place out.   Koma is located on the corner of Durango and Flamingo inside the plaza where Jack in the Box is. When you first walk in, you'll notice it's pretty small (40 people max). We came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm and it was already starting to get packed. There was only one table open for two!! You can choose to sit at the sushi bar or one of the tables. If you want to come here with a big group, I suggest calling ahead to see how busy they are, but they won't guarantee a table and they do not take reservations.   FOOD: My husband & I got the AYCE dinner. The fish was always fresh. We tried the following:   1. Salmon & Salmon Belly (Unlimited salmon belly here--- SAY WHAT!!!!)  2. Tuna  3. Yellowtail (This was my favorite)  4. Uni with a raw quail egg on top (Best and freshest uni in town and the quail egg really compliments the uni flavor)  5. Eel  6. Mackeral (My least favorite)  7. Alaska handroll (basically a California roll w/ salmon in it. It was really good here because they added sesame seeds to it)  8. Calamari & Shrimp Tempura (crispy!!!)  9. Baked Mussel (Some were cooked perfectly and others were overcooked and chewy)  10. Dragon Roll (Basic and the same as any other place)  11. Plum wine dessert (MUST TRY)   The sushi chefs were super nice to us and they decided to give us a special toro plate that was AMAZING! It was melt in your mouth good. Seriously, I give the tuna toro a 5. :-)   SERVICE: The night we came it was really busy so the staff was not on their game. It took a good 25 minutes before we got any of the food we ordered. Half of it came, then it took another 20 minutes for the rest of the order to come. They also forgot to bring us water and the kitchen items we ordered. We actually received our shrimp tempura and calamari after we had put in our dessert order, which was lame. All the servers were sweet and apologetic about it.   PRICE: Typical AYCE dinner price of $25.95. It's a great deal for the quality of the fish and the fish to rice ratio.   Overall, my husband and I enjoyed Sushi Koma. I wouldn't say it is the best in town, but some dishes were definitely above average. If you enjoy a reasonable fish to rice ratio then this is your place, but don't expect Sakana or Sushi Neko level where the pieces of fish are double the length of the rice. You'll still get your money's worth at the end of the meal.   Happy Dinings,  J Tran",

Some of the rolls were wrong (asked for no avocado, there was avocado.) Then the bill came, it was split almost perfectly (into 2 checks) but they then somehow managed to charge one card for both receipts and weren't sure how to fix. Once they finally figured that out, they gave us the wrong change ($30+ missing.) we finally decided to ask for a manager. His response to the multiple issues was \"I'm sorry.\"",

The server seemed to freak out when we asked about the sake prices and didn't know. Told us the sake bottle prices range from $10-$25 max. Comes to that the bottle we were told was $20 was really $79. WAY OFF!   Forgot most of our order and had to keep reminding them. Edamame came last and the baked mussels were just . The venue just didn't have that overall friendly local sushi vibe. Food quality was less that 2 stars and I'll be impressed if we don't get sick tomorrow. The sake though was good.

Their dessert is literally one mochi ball or scoop of vanilla/plum ice cream. No other AYCE options for dessert.   Most of the rolls are drenched in sauce, as well as the only \"sashimi\" appetizer option (seared tuna). They have one small fresh roll with the dinner price that's essential a soy paper/daikon sashimi roll and it's literally five tiny tiny pieces and you only get one order.   The only two dinner only speciality nigiri options they have are sweet shrimp and uni. As was disappointed with their nigiri options. Was hoping for other options you see elsewhere like yuzu yellowtail, garlic tuna, ocean trout, fatty tuna, salmon belly, seared salmon, red snapper, etc.  Appetizer list is pretty small, not more than 10-15 items. Brie and grape quesadilla was a surprise to see but pretty good.   Service was slow as well. I hate to leave bad reviews but I was left wanting more than I could find at tens of other AYCE joints. Our service was also super slow. I know this place has a cult following but I don't know why.",

I've come here a couple times since and it has been just as great every time since then :)  The restaurant itself is pretty small but it feels bigger when you're in it. The decor is pretty simple and clean, nothing too fancy. The sushi bar is always nice to see when eating sushi you can watch it being made.   The service is very quick and when they clean up you're plates when done you can barely get the last piece off before the plate is gone. Makes it so you can see how much you have eaten! They are attentive without being obnoxious.   All the food is amazing!!!!! I have had most all rolls at Sushi Koma and each is as good as the next.

My partner and I were quickly greeted and seated. The seating area was spacious and not crowded and the service was very quick and friendly.  The appetizers were all really good. The Seared Tuna Carpaccio was super flavorful and comes with sliced fresh tuna smothered in a ponzu and yumyum sauce. The Seafood Tostada was also equally as flavorful and came as a mini tower of assorted fish atop a crunchy chip. With how much fish there was, I think it should come with 2 chips to share. The Bulgogi was a hit that we ordered a couple. I liked that the Bulgogi  came with sauteed onions and chives making the dish very flavorful. The Sashimi Roll was ok, light and healthy tasting.  Their rice is nicely cooked in all of the dishes and is sticky and al dente, what sushi rice should be!   From the Nigiri rolls, I really enjoyed the favorite White Tuna (velvety smooth and fresh) Salmon, and Eel. The yellowtail was ok, it tasted more like the sea.   For the specialty Rolls, I really liked the Venice Roll (comes with salmon, shrimp, avocado and eel sauce) and the Big B which comes topped with succulent beef. I wasn't a huge fan of the Kimmy roll (pretty bland), the Fish Paradise (the spicy tuna was too spicy and the garlic was too strong).  Overall the majority of the dishes were 5 stars and the service was on point!",

They have a huge assortment of rolls, organized from fresh, to spicy, to deep fried. Jin, our server, was so nice to answer our questions about each and explain what made each one unique. She made really great suggestions and not a single one was disappointing.   My measure of a great sushi place is their nigiri, and theirs was especially good. The fish was all so fresh and buttery, and each one had a really great lemony/ ponzu flavor. More so than other places, and I think it's kind of their signature. Love it.   The atmosphere is hip and inviting. Great art on the walls and you're greeted enthusiastically both on your way in and out. Another place I'm happy to f",

I recommend this place for quite a treat.   I came here on a visit from out of town with a party of 20 (yes, unusually large) and it was a little nuts for them to get all of our orders correctly and without the use of any technology. They just wrote each of our orders down on a little pad of paper and pencil! (I think it would've been less stressful if they did have a computerized system of ordering, though. ha!) But they still managed to get in our orders. You can have unlimited rolls of our choice or as many sushi nigiris as you want. They do star the items on the menu that are not all-you-can-eat (like the sweet shrimp; just order once).   Order the white tuna nigiri! And keep them coming! That was my favorite nigiri. It's so fatty, smooth and fresh -- you'll love it! And it's usually pricey at other locations. But with all-you-can-eat, you can snap up these babies to your heart's content!   You can also order non-stop rolls. My favorite roll was the Kamikaze with a spicy kick. Loved the spicy tuna and salmon here, too. The squid had a little chemically aftertaste to me. so I wouldn't get that one again, but for something different, you can try octopus. The mackerel appetizer was also very tasty. The rolls came out slowly, and we were already full by the time the last set came out (perhaps it was hard to time everything because we had such a big group?) The check also came out at a snail's pace. I almost fell asleep while waiting from food coma. But thankfully the waitstaff was accommodating to give us separate checks for each and every person. For dessert, we got the ice cream mochi. Yum! I tried the strawberry mochi and it was the perfect cap to the evening!",

    "text": "I ignored the reviews. That was my fault.  I like to visit different places and give my own honest review - some experiences are better than others and I think Sushi Koma deserved that chance. Especially since a lot of other Yelpers have had mixed reviews.  My experience, however, was on the low end of the spectrum. We didn't have to wait long and were seated almost immediately, which was nice.  Unfortunately, the experience went downhill from there. I ordered our food quickly after being seated and waters right away. Our first round of food came out - but we were left without drinks for almost 10 minutes following that. Our waitresses presence was scarce and no one else would take orders. At the end of the meal, I counted 4 different dishes that never made it to the table even after stating we were still waiting for them. On a few instances, the fish looked old and some had a very strong odor (I didn't eat it).   For a few dollars more, I will have to take my business elsewhere. I do wish this experience went a lot better.",

    "text": "Food was good, but the \"service\" was bizarre. My son and I walked in on a Sunday at opening time. We were the only two customers in the place. No hostess was at the podium so we stood and waited. A couple walked in behind us and sat at the bench. Finally, a hostess came to the podium, doesn't acknowledge me or my son, looks past us to the couple on the bench and asks, \"Who was here first?\" Um, what? I say \"We were\" but she ignored me and waited for the couple at the bench to confirm it. Did she think we cut in front of them? So strange. Then she says to the couple, \"I will be right back to seat you.\" STILL HAS  NOT SAID A WORD TO ME!  She seats us, gives us menus, doesn't explain the menu or AYCE or a la carte, takes our drink order, then leaves. I'm ready to bolt, but my son really wanted to try the sushi. She came back, we ordered appetizers, then we attempted to order a la carte sushi. She stops us and asks if we want AYCE. I said no, started to order again, and she stopped us again. She talked into the headset she was wearing, asked for a lunch menu. The menu arrived and she explained it would be better to order from that menu. Then she left without taking our order. I was just so shocked, I've never had a server stop me from ordering, then leave. My son said, \"She's just trying to get us to buy something more expensive.\" Maybe? I honestly don't know.  She came back and we ordered the a la carte sushi, but not before she tried to talk us out of it again. Am I missing something? Our food came out sort of randomly, but I thought it all tasted good, my son agreed. I would come back for the food, but the service was so odd/dismissive, I won't be back.",

Negatives: - one item never came but at least we werent charged for that. - drink refills are not free. Other than that this is a decent all you can eat sushi place. Its really not worth it to order a la carte. 13-14$ for an entree might as well just pay that extra 10 and enjoy the whole experience.",

    "text": "I measure by three different things in comparison to Taco Bell:  DECOR: Sushi Koma is located in a plaza with numerous other food places and stores. Walking in it's actually quite tiny! However I do like atmosphere. This place is definitely for the younger crowd. Think teenage to 30s. The waitresses dress in pretty revealing clothing short shorts and tied shirts. The music is loud and random, but I dug it. 1.5 stars for decor.   SERVICE:  The service was pretty good. I was with a group, so a lot of Sushi was to be ordered (we all got the buffet). It's not surprising that some of the order came out in different time slots and I believe one order might have been forgotten. But to be reasonable a large order of sushi (think six items) must be hard to keep track of, so that's understandable. .5 stars for service.  FOOD: The sushi and appetizers are delicious! For appetizers I tried the Gyoza and the Brie and Grape Quesadilla. Both were absolutely delicious! Note though the Brie and Grape Quesadilla should probably be an afterthought as a dessert. It's very sweet so it didn't exactly compliment the food. As far as Sushi rolls go, I tried D.A. Roll, Double-D Roll, Kimmy Roll, and more. They were all delicious and fresh! Great sushi here! Be adventurous and try some cool stuff! 2 stars for food!  FINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? Nah.  Sushi is great and if you're in the mood treat yourself! If you an under 30 person definitely go here. It's hip, fun, and delicious. It won't make a hole in your wallet as the buffet is $25.95. Not that bad considering Sushi can add up quickly and is expensive anyway. This way you can try a lot and not worry about spending too much! Note that if you are over 30, I'm not saying not to go here, It's just this place draws a young crowd and has loud music. if you are down with that though for sure try this place! It's amazing! Now when will Taco Bell have a buffet...",

My favorites are the sashimi roll (so sad that you can only order one), tuna carpaccio, Arizona roll, super philly, kimmie, and the almost fire (I only like this one the old way they used to make it. You have to request it) and the yellowtail nigiri is my absolute favorite. They put little jalapenos on top and it's so delicious! I definitely leave in a sushi koma everytime I come here, so they did their job.",

I'm definitely coming back and recommending it to everyone who visits Vegas. I've been to a few difference AYCE sushi joints in la and Vegas and there hasn't been a place that I really loved except for this one.  My favorites are the tuna carpaccio and the sushi taco thing called seafood tostada are super juicy and the best on the menu. The Nigiris are all very fresh and juicy. The beef sushi called Big b sushi was pretty good and their miso soup was very tasty. The sashimi sushi was very good but it's very small and it's just one per person order.   The servers are very attentive and very quick. As busy as they are they still have a smile and get your orders as quick as they can. The price is very reasonable for lunch and dinner less than $26.

But once you walk in it's well decorated and really brings a bit of Asian feel to the place. Looks nice from the inside!   All the employees were nice, I went when they were slow, so everyone was very attentive.   The nigiri was really good, very fresh and that's what consisted of most of my meal.  Overall I had a great sushi dinner, but the outstanding feature of the meal was the SABA (mackerel nigiri) it was so good. It was the best Saba I've ever had, soft, lightly seasoned with fresh garlic and chives. I ended up ordering 'another order of Saba' 3 times. I'll probably come back just for the Saba. Get it!  It got 4 stars and not 5 because of some very minor service mishaps. I wish I could give a 4.5/5.   Also take note! Lunch price AYCE ends at 3 now, not 4. :)   Great little gem in Vegas!",

Sushi is Fresh, food not bad, sushi chef is a nice guy, most staff are nice, service is prompt the and the restaurant is clean. But my last visit did not turn out well. After been recognized as a regular and exchanging pleasantries with few of the staffs and sushi chef, when I was about to pay the check with my Visa card, the dumb manager asked for my ID which would have been okay if I were there for the first time or looked creepy, but this was an insult so I paid my bill and 1st time in my life I left with $0 Tips. In this economy restaurants are competing for business where these guys managed to make a happy customer mad. So I probably will advice you all to find a better, friendlier place where you and your money will be appreciated.",

    "text": "A dimly lit sushi joint for the late nights with your friends that like to stuff their faces with oddly named rolls. Let me make it clear right now that, 98% of the time, I will never suggest going out to eat for sushi, but this was a special occasion and my friends chose to have AYCE sushi here on a Friday night.  The Arrival: The wait wasn't too long at all for my party of eight. Yes, eight! I'm guessing we got very lucky! \"Sweet!\" I thought. \"Seated so soon? Love this place already.\" NOTE: I would also like to note that it says they take reservations here on Yelp, but I don't think they do.  The Folks Running This Place: Everyone was very friendly, but not all of them were knowledgeable of what the menu items were. Some looks were exchanged on the names of certain orders, but that was solved almost immediately. I wouldn't remember all of them either, if I worked there. This would be a good place to add that their menu selection is extensive! So many weird names to remember! I also asked one of the servers for a recommendation, my table loved it and we ended up ordering another.  The Overall Atmosphere: It'll seem crowded because of the size of the room. People are talking, music is playing, orders are flying out consistently, and the whole place is alive. It's all good.  The Grub: I'm not a sushi lover, but I enjoyed several of the options here, and am the kind of person who is always willing to try everything. My sushi-loving friends enjoyed their food wholeheartedly ordering one after another. Our empty plates would pile high at the end of the table.  ***Here are some menu items we would recommend: seafood tostada, lemon eight roll, ninja roll, mussels, Vegas roll, salmon nigiri and the tuna carpaccio you've probably read about on here about a hundred times is definitely worth a try.  Anyway, they've got my stars. Nothing went wrong, we were treated well, and nearly everything I tried was delicious. And yes, I left full and \"koma\"tose!",

Rolls my friend and I tried: fish paradise roll, tempura roll, variety of nigiri rolls, spicy tuna roll. PLEASE NOTE: Spicy tuna roll is actually really spicy here. It's my fave but if I come here again I definitely will pass on it.  Pros: Overall it was great and delicious experience. $22 for all you can eat lunch buffet (soft drinks not included). Waitress was fast and attentive. Sushi was fresh. Plenty of parking.  Cons: it's a small business with limited seating, I can see at peak hours they must have long waiting times. Also, it's located way off the strip.",

The fish was not fresh, tasted like it came straight from the freezer and was thawed out. Their selection was boring and simple. The only good thing about this place was the fish to rice ratio.

They have some tasty things on the menu but in my opinion it's not better then the average Vegas sushi joint.   The moral of the story: skip this place!",

He said \"tell them it's expensive\" after that,waiter come to us and tells me toro is $20 per order. Ummm I know. I eat more Expensive foods than that, stupid. I told him that Im totally fine with price I will order toro. After that,waiter went to chef and asked again,the chef said to him \"shit why you took the order which is hard to cut. I have to bring frozen toro and have to waited it get melt. So lazy shit,tell them we don't have\" after that,the waiter come to my table and tells me they don't have toro.

I feel so bad about that crazy guy will talk shit about you at front of you but you will don't know   I still can't forget about that stupid face of him when I talked with my friend on the phone and use same language that he spoke very loud.

My first impression of Koma is that it's very small and cute, armed with a drawn-on glass board and two TVs. There were two attentive and friendly waitresses who were happy to answer any questions or explain which items were most popular. The sushi chefs were fairly welcoming as well.  We sat at the bar and got AYCE of course. I wasn't surprised that the nigiri was decorated with garnishes and sauces because I had done prior research on Yelp. As expected, I still prefer my nigiri without any other flavors aside from soy sauce and wasabi. The yellowtail came with jalapeno slices, which frankly doesn't even go with it in my opinion. However, the sauce of the white tuna actually complemented its natural flavor, so I left that on. The salmon came with lemon slices which were welcome, but overloaded.  As per the waitress' suggestion, we tried the carpaccio and some other appetizers, which were alright. I've had better and I've had worse. The mochi ice cream was either old or had frostbite because it fell apart and had no elasticity remaining.  Honestly, the highlight of my meal was probably the super-salted edamame they served in the beginning. I do love sea salt and the edamame was firm and tasty.",

We spent twice the price for the sake as compared to what we had at Sushi Hokkaido the week before, where the quality was twice as good. In the end, we spent the same amount as we had at Hokkaido, but we were less impressed with both the sake & the sushi.",

They were able to accommodate our large party and took our orders efficiently!  We ordered tons of different sushi and appetizers to share which definitely hit the spot!  All of the fish was very fresh and the servers were very attentive and helpful! My favorites were the uni, yellowtail, and albacore! The baked mussel appetizer was also one of my faves. Each person also got dessert, which comes with the all you can eat menu! They have ice cream and mochi! Yummy!",

    "text": "this is one of those \"if i could give it zero or negative rating i would\" type of reviews.. unfortunately i basically paid to get treated like shit today whilst trying to relax my mind smh.  first of all, to reassure & confirm, i asked girl at the front desk before hand if the business took \"apple pay\" she said yes. i sat down to eat. i was simply rushed into leaving if i wasnt ordering anything else.. & every 5-6 mins or so the chef & his side kick kept bothering me asking me if i wanted anything else to eat or if the food was good. now if they would have given me time to put it in my mouth & enjoy my time there it probably would have tasted a lot better.  **MAIN REASON I EVEN POSTED ON YELP BELOW** when my plate was empty the chef came and took my plate & proceeded to bring me my bill. i picked it up & walked to the front desk, & said \"im paying with my phone\" this time instead of the front desk girl i originally spoke with, there was an older bald oriental guy who was very rude, and he said  \"no we dont do that\" i said \"i asked the girl that was here ahead of time, so why would she say no?\" he said \"i dont know, but we dont do that..\" i said \"okay well i need to get cash back from the gast station next door & he started making phone calls and making me feel uncomfortable... he asked me to leave my purse.. MY F*CKING PURSE.. can u believe that?? instead of reassuring his self with his front desk cashier.. he assumed/implied that i was a thief.. i was so uncomfortable & embarrased.. then i said \"i am NOT comfortable leaving my purse with you, & im not doing that.. why dont we at least try it and see if i can pay that way??\"  and of course, it went through and i fully paid for my order.. his frown & anger then disappeared & he said \"oh i didnt know we took that\" & i told him \"you're welcome\" & left. now i could begin to understand why he's feel a certain way about me having apple pay.. especially after eating in & being served before i paid.. but he should have went about things in a MUCH more friendly AND professional WAY. that really made that business look bad to me. it was bad enough i was having a rough day.. leaving there AFTER paying for that shitty experience was a horrible feeling when i left. & it was my first time being there.  POOR service. & the food was luke warm, even tho they said it was \"freshly baked\".. worst sushi restaurant ive ever been too.. the chairs didnt even match ..",

    "text": "I have to agree with Jade - it's the service here that blows the other AYCE places away. Maybe it's the small format which sets Sushi Koma and the esteemed (but not AYCE) Yummy Grill on West Lake Mead Blvd apart from the rest. Drinks and plates are always being attended to - an AYCE meal at Koma doesn't have to take an hour or more, you could probably rip in and out of here in 25 mins with a suitably full belly.  Speaking of belly, yellowtail belly and salmon belly are almost always available and good quality, the tako sushi is tender, the special tostada is awesome, and the gyoza are addictive - thinly-wrapped and perfectly pan toasted. I could eat 100+ pieces of these if I had to.  Unagi is always good quality, and their saba (mackerel) is unusually delicate and light: it's made in-house and not super smoky/briny like most places. I love it. I prefer the live scallop on-the-shell at Yummy Grill to the 'fresh' scallop version at Koma, but maybe that's just me.   You really feel like an appreciated customer here. Smiles among the cool waitstaff are a plenty and the Koma chefs have got skills. Sushi Koma feels like a small NYC-style spot - except you don't have to wait 45mins for a seat at the sushi bar. That's a good feeling.",

As before, not the best sushi I've ever had, but if you have a large appetite and want to save a couple of dollars I definitely recommend dining here.  One of the things I appreciate about Sushi Koma is how fast the service is and especially compared to most Japanese restaurants. There are some places in town you'd need a sundial to time the waitress. At Koma, our servers were right on point and delivered everything with a quickness!  We'll definitely be returning.",

Staff is friendly and prompt and they take good care of their guests.  There were three of us and we sat at the bar. This was on Saturday night on 6:30 pm. We didn't have to wait, but the restaurant had a line waiting within an hour of us being there... it is small. One of us had not really tried too much sushi in the past, so it was a great way to order a lot of different things without the bill being astronomical. The menu has all the traditional nigiri, hand rolls and then has several fusion rolls, including some baked and some deep fried. I think there is something for everyone here.  We found the service quite attentive and the wait for our orders was not very long, even as they got busier. It was good experience and I would go back for sure.",

    "text": "Food poisoning.  Now, bacteria can come from anywhere--a dirty door handle, utensil, cup, etc.--but Sushi Koma was the only commonality between my mom and I this day and we both became extremely sick after eating there. It's day two and I'm still feeling ill as I type this.  I think I can pinpoint the culprit: the spicy tuna. We both had remarked that it tasted 'sharp', maybe even bitter. I chalked it up to different seasonings. Spicy tuna is one of my favorites, but this tasted different and I simply assumed Koma has a proprietary mix. My mom and I ate the whole roll anyway, just to avoid being charged for it as per the AYCE policy, but boy, do I wish I'd ponied up the bucks rather than eaten that.  Regarding the rest of our meal, the salmon nigiri was delicious, buttery and soft with minimal rice. We'd made plans to return and order five orders of it, it was that good. The pinnacle roll was just okay. We enjoyed the Venice. Not a fan of the breading on the calamari, it was far too dense for the amount of meat. Felt like we'd ordered a bowl of fried panko.  As I said, the salmon was excellent and we would have returned to gorge on that, but when you have a painful experience like we both did (and are continuing to have -- Jesus, my mom is throwing up as I speak!) you know better than to risk it twice!  Edit: I tried to keep my review reasonable so it would be taken seriously, but listening to my mom being sick is making me pretty angry. Sushi Koma, shame on you.",

Here's a tip order half rolls so that you have room to sample a greater variety off the menu. The nigiri sushi was splendid, fantastic fish to rice ratio. The only negative was minor- one of the nigiri pieces was served with a garlic topping which I didn't realize until it was too late. So if you aren't a fan of garlic and are ordering off the Nigiri section make sure you tell them no garlic. :) On the other hand, when I mentioned I didn't like cucumber in my rolls the waitress made sure that it was always substituted with avocado. Fantastic quality and service! (FYI: We went at around 4-6pm on a Friday night so not too busy, but it's a small eating area so during busier times it could potentially be harder to get a seat.)",

The fish is always fresh and you'll definitely leave in a food \"KOMA\". Chris, the owner, is always so hospitable and accommodating. He passes by everyone's table and asks about the food and service and makes sure everyone is enjoying themselves.

    "text": "Solid choice for AYCE sushi!  Not quite my favorite, but it will be in my sushi rotation now!  What makes or breaks this spot for you, is whether you like their \"twists\" on sushi.  All my nigiri had sauces on them.  I am used to plain fish/rice, maybe a little lemon or wasabi hiding in there, but they used sauces.  I liked MOST of the combinations...others didn't do much for me and wished they were plain.  (I hear you can just request without the sauces though).  The most important thing though, the fish tasted fresh and the service was good, although I went dry a few times on the drinks.  The food comes fast, and empty plates disappear quickly.  You have to try the tuna carpaccio, the tostada, and they other apps.  Those were probably the highlight of the night for myself.  A nice change from the norm....although they do limit you to 1PP.  This place is very small though.  We came around 11pm on a Tuesday night, and we still had to wait 30min for a table.  Be prepared to wait, no matter what time you show up.  This wasn't a big deal for me, since I never mind waiting for something \"worth\" waiting for...  And they also seem to skimp out on the desserts.  They have it clearly written, one dessert per person....this isn't a big deal for me personally, but a lot of my friends go crazy with the AYCE mochi and tempura icecream found in other places.  Last thing, order the tempura icecream for dessert!  Yes, you will have to pay an additional $4-5 since it is not included....but it is worth it!  Not only is the portion size huge, but they make it out of strawberry icecream so it is super sweet, and very good.  So even though it has some faults, there were plenty of good things to outshine and pull out the 5 star in my book.  Go for it!",

Music was a bit loud but we were the oldest people there.   Specialty rolls were very very good.  Nigiri was fresh and presentation was nice.   My sister, who frequents sushi places definitely got her sushi fix and said that there was equal amounts of rice and fish, whereas most places they have more rice than fish.   Speed of the food coming out was excellent.  They turned tables quickly without making you feel rushed.  I would definitely go back again.  I had mostly the specialty rolls, but really want to try the Nigiri.",

The fish is fresh -- probably fresher than other sushi joints I've been to. Their carpaccio was divine. The shrimp tempura was lightly battered and very delicious.   The service was good; however, they were pretty busy so the food came pretty slow. The servers were very nice though so it kinda made up for it. Also, we didn't finish one of our rolls and they didn't charge us for it because they knew it was taking long. Overall, it was a great dining experience.",

Not food poisoning or anything big, but just not fresh.    Price is compatible with other AYCE places.  I do like their appetizer selections, with a bit more varieties than the usual suspects.  The sashimi roll...warming, it's SO TINY.  It's like the size of my finger, no joke.  Although it's refreshing and tasting..it's just a bit too small.    I don't normally eat rolls, I like to eat the real fish, so nigiri is how I can tell if the fish is fresh or not.  So I can't review if the rolls are good or not.    I don't like how they add sauce on all the nigiris for you.  But you can inform the sushi chef or waiter to not put sauce on top for you.  I learned that after a few orders came in, I had to tell them to stop.  And the sauce was not spectacular or anything, seems either ponzu, soy or sea salt, but just seems like they want to cover up the unfreshness of the fish?  Maybe that's not their intension, but why would they do it?  We are capable of dunking our pieces of nigiri in our wasabi/soy ourselves.    They also like to add sea salt on the scallops..which makes the scallops really salty.  A little yuzu would be just fine.    Overall, decent AYCE place, not the best and not the worst.  Service was great and it's a bit tiny and they can get pretty overwhelming at times.",

Definitely try their: First paradise, Tuna Carpaccio, Sashimi roll, and the salmon nigiri! Anything salmon here was delectable, phenomenal, and buttery!  I can't think of anything bad about this place but one time, we ordered sake and received a little drink called cooking wine.. It was... YUCK!! That only happened because it was someones first day and we felt bad because we got them in trouble. BUT they gave us a free bottle of their best sake and it was sparkling amazing so I can't say sh!t! But I just did.... So there...   The waitresses were great!! They came back for our order before we were ready so more food came just at the right time. They suggested their favorite rolls which we ate without question o.O jk it was well worth it and definitely trusted their judgement!   Check this place out! It's also open late ;) ... late night carb load!!",

The fish was very fresh and yummy when I went however the rice was a little hard for my taste. I did LOVE the tuna carpaccio with garlic chips and the quesadilla with grapes was different & tasty! Like people have mentioned before they do seem to add more sauce than other places but if you just let them know from the get go that you don't like saucy things they will refrain. The service is very fast and friendly! The restaurant itself is pretty small though! I will say Goyemon has one leg up on them for having more creative desserts. But this place is definitely worth checking out & I have to support my Korean brothas~ haha  Tip: don't forget to get a stamp loyalty card",

At the smaller one they were fast, quick and friendly. Now that they got a bigger place they're slow and just take their time with everything. I went here with my girlfriend and it was just all bad. We got waited on by 3 different servers and we had to tell the host that the service was bad. Took forever to get rolls to us and they had more then enough severs.   I gave this place one more chance and tried it for lunch with my mom and there were like 3 tables and 2 people at at the bar. So we sit at the bar and there one waiter running around trying to do everything and she did a great job but still slow and I thought wen you sit at the bar you tell the people you order so it's faster. Guessed wrong she had to come take out order and give it to them when we're sitting right in front of them, like we can tell them. The people next to us were telling them their orders but they never acknowledged us once unless it was an order from the waiter. So unless they get better servers like the ones from the small spot I'm not going here cause you'll be there for 1 1/2 to 2 hours just to eat sushi.",

EVERYTHING! This is the best AYCE selection I've ever seen.   Now, for the food. The food is mediocre, it all depends on what you order. Some of the rolls come out warm, so they don't have that cold refreshing sushi taste that we all know and love.   Out of all the rolls I ordered, I only liked one. But they don't call me sushi-sensei for nothing, my sushi taste is quite refined (me coming from Hawaii and all). So don't let this discourage you! The sushi had a somewhat odd taste to me, but on the bright side, you can try all the sushi rolls you like until you find one that meets all your needs!   Overall, best AYCE selection since you can literally have ANYTHING on their menu and you can share with other AYCE members. But the sushi itself was just \"ok\".",

That's like looking for the most amazing wine at a liquor store; yet, here the dogma sits and becomes broken again and again every time I revisit this now must-go-to restaurant in Las Vegas. It's never disappointed me or my friends when we've come here. This amazing place is Sushi Koma.  Location - 4 stars  For some people Las Vegas lives and dies on the Strip. Many people think there's no point venturing blocks, much less 7 miles away from Las Vegas Blvd. However, being able to enjoy Las Vegas from a local's perspective I've seen so much greatness exist outside the neon confines of one street. Though being 7 miles away from the heart of the Strip could be considered too far for some, I think this measly 15 minute drive allows Sushi Koma to be exactly what it wants to be without the pressure of having to follow any rubric or standard like you might on the Strip. It stays True to what it wants to be and that's what makes it special. Located within a low key strip mall with only a small sign outside its one door entrance, huge flavor hides in this nook.  Interior - 4 stars  Some would say this restaurant is small. I don't disagree. Entering into the restaurant you can see all four corners of the restaurant with a small tilt of your head. Including the sushi bar this place probably fits close to 35-40 people at max capacity. Waits can be as long as 40 minutes during the busy hours. But when you look at the hand painted cherry blossom trees and hand written signs, this place really has character. It's charming and you feel invited as soon as you sit down. It is an intimate, safe place.  Food - 5 stars  I know you hear it all the time but this place is the Real Deal Holyfield when it comes to quality sushi. Sure, AYCE sushi is often just whatever when it comes to quality. After all, you expect to eat a lot of decent food, not spectacular food. Sushi Koma breaks that ideology completely. Though all-you-can-eat (or all-you-can-koma in their words) is the name of the game, so much of the food has body and flavor. The appetizers have the standard items like gyoza, edamame, and miso soup but than it takes you into left field with items like a brie and grape quesadilla or seafood ceviche tostada on a wonton chip. Their rolls aren't just cheaply bound stacks of rice sloppily soaked in eel and sriracha mayo sauce but carefully crafted and balanced. My favorite is their nigiri. To be able to eat fresh tasting salmon, white tuna, and even mackerel, a fish I generally hate eating raw, is blissful. Top it off with the ability to order half roll orders and getting ice cream at the end of the meal, having quantity AND quality is a dream that comes True at Sushi Koma.    Price - 5 stars  With a place touting both quality and quantity it's more than reasonable to think this place will break your wallet down. After all, just to get a la carte sushi on the Strip can cost you nearly $20 a plate. However, lunch starts at $25 and dinner is $29. That means you can have all that you wished for and more for under $30! Just win one hand of blackjack and you can eat here!  Staff - 5 stars  I really like the staff here. Because this is a small place the staff really take care of you. They can focus their attention on helping you out and when you ask for suggestions, they have actual opinions. They won't always tell you to get the most expensive item, just the tastiest to them. A staff that cares about the customer as well as being proud of the food they serve is the mark of a great restaurant.   Conclusion  I've held my tongue for almost a year now to write this review because I was afraid to share this place to the world. Like Gollum in \"Lord of the Rings\", I wanted to horde and keep \"my precious\" to myself. But Sushi Koma is just too great of a place not to share. Whether you love sushi or just getting into it, Sushi Koma is a must when visiting Las Vegas. Be prepared to have your mind blown and fall into a food \"koma\" after dining here.",

    "text": "My favorite thing about this place is its ambiance. It's an all-you-can-eat sushi joint located in a strip mall, but once you get inside, it is so tiny and cramped that it seems like some place you might actually find in Tokyo, which I find really lends to its authenticity. Regretfully, the food was not as impressive as the ambiance.  I started with the sea urchin, and it was probably the best sea urchin I've ever had. That being said, it still provoked an innate gag reflex, and I had a rather difficult time swallowing it but because the \"rules\" on the menu state that there is an extra charge for any leftovers and the listed charge for the sea urchin was \"market price,\" I swallowed it down like Divine eating that dog turd in Pink Flamingos and didn't think about it for the rest of the meal. The \"3-10 roll\" was scallop based, but I am convinced that these scallops would have given Gordon Ramsey a stroke. To say it tasted bad would be an understatement. It was an abortion, and I couldn't eat more than the one piece. Fortunately they didn't charge me extra, so perhaps my valiant effort with the sea urchin was in vain, but then again, it's best not to push the envelope.  Next, I had the \"Denver roll,\" all of which I gladly ate after my experience with the 3-10 roll. The fried calamari was also fine. My favorite savory item was the brie & grape quesadilla (not pictured); however, it is also a 3-ingredient dish that I could have prepared myself in under 5 minutes. Unfortunately, they only let you have one of this item. The best part of the meal was the plum wine ice cream at the end. It was delightful and almost floral, so I was disappointed that they only allowed me one Japanese-sized scoop of it.  Overall, I have to say that Sushi Koma is not worth the trip unless it is late at night and you are really craving sushi - because the place is open until 3AM. Other than that, I can't recommend it.",

We were over 15 minutes late getting back because the server took forever to bring the individual dishes, some people in our party didn't even get their rolls until 5 minutes before we left!! And it was supposed to be all you can eat!!! They essentially paid $20+ for ONE ROLL. Oh, and did we mention they brought two people's rolls on one plate and mixed them?? The food was decent, but the waitress (only one, because as the other one will tell you, \"she only does drinks\") was incredibly lacking in attention and a positive attitude. There was no apology, no offer of a discount or anything, even though we made it very clear we were on a lunch schedule and some of still hadn't eaten. Never going back.",

We are super use to great sushi and even better all you can eat options. We visited here after the gym for a cheat meal and found ourself super disappointed. The wait to to get sat was quick but everything after that was FOREVER. It took 10 mins to get greeted and that was a busser not server! Our drinks took so long when I went to the bathroom I reminded the server we had no drinks we ordered everything at one and after an 45 mins our last item never arrived and I ask for the bill. I was over it. AYCE was $25/$27 per person and 100% feel like I wasted money!",

This was the first time trying Sushi Koma and I will be a regular for sure.  The place itself is small but when you walk in honestly that is what gives it it's appeal. The decor is cute and the entire staff seems so relaxed and works together cheerfully.  One trick is to order a few hints at once because they do get busy.  There wasn't anything on the menu that i tried that I didn't like. The fish was fresh the rolls tasted uniquely different as they should. I loved the rolls that were smaller too. I wish I had taken more pictures. Price was well worth it and comparable to other sushi places.   Can't wait to go back.",

Fortunately I usually get a table right away because I have a small party. The waiters are so sweet, patient, and attentive. The GM or owner (I'm not sure? he looks important lmao) is always out on the floor helping the staff which is really nice.   I take the 20 minute drive out to this place because every other sushi place I go to cannot compare.   My favorite rolls are the kimmy and mountain roll! And their nigiri is so fresh and well cut. You have to try their yum yum sauce on your dishes. Somehow, it's better than other places.   Thank you for such a wonderful place with talented chefs and amazing staff!",

Reasonably wide selection on menu.  Avoid anything with yum yum sauce which seemed like hot, melted mayonnaise. Some appetizer dishes OK, like the seafood tostada and spicy edamame, but a bit on the salty side and a bit too much fried garlic.  Best approach is to mainly order nigiri sushi, which had modest amount of rice per piece rather than mostly rice instead of fish.  A bit of concern was that the hamachi was totally different looking the second order, which brings to question whether one or the other was the same fish.",

We were greeted right away, we sat at the sushi bar, and we ordered AYCE (and a Sapporo, duh!). Edamame to start, it was okay, a little bowl that seemed to be microwaved...  Then we got two orders of white tuna and their tuna carpaccio. The white tuna was buttery and fresh and the carpaccio was more like a garlic tuna - both were good. I was disappointed that they don't have tuna poke, they offered a tuna tostada... we passed. I don't want 'kind of a poke,' I want poke! I love that you can get 1/2 rolls with AYCE. We had the Ponzio, Fish Paradise, Stephanie and Dragon Rolls (1/2 orders) I liked them all, the sauce was slightly heavy-handed, but really good! We had to have one more order of white tuna (mmm mmm good!). I also ordered mackerel (thats my judge on a good sushi spot, if its fresh, its a keeper). Needless to say, Sushi Freak (Koma / Buzzz) is a KEEPER! With a huge portion of tempura ice cream for dessert, we were stuffed, happily so! The server was friendly, attentive and gave great suggestions.  We will be back for sure!",

Their AYCE includes a large selection of appetizers that most places don't offer like chicken teriyaki, mussels, shrimp tempura, beef teriyaki and more! Chris the sushi chef is the guy to ask for when you are there, he bends over backwards to make custom rolls for you that you are looking to try!! Customer service all around here is second to none, you can't go a minute without them removing your used plates and drink refills. A++++ will continue to visit time and time again!!!",

It's a small, hip, hole-in-the-wall type of sushi bar. The food was a bit overpriced, as my girlfriend also agreed upon when I mentioned how 4 pieces of small shrimp tempura is $6?! Idk, maybe I'm overreacting haha we didn't get our second water until close to the end of our meal, nor did we get our second shot glass for our sake until the second large sake bottle we ordered. We asked for extra napkins, which wasn't provided. The waitress was nice, but was gone in the back most of the time. We had to even order with the sushi chef once. Nonetheless, we still tipped 20% totaling to 65$ for 2 small sakes, 1 large sake, California rolls, shrimp and veggie tempura, crunchy rolls, and spicy tuna rolls. I guess I'm used to even recognized sushi bars having a happy hour or not being so overpriced.... I liked the music though! Haha",

    "text": "I came here with a pretty large party (9 people). This place is REALLY small and I wouldn't recommend large parties coming here, but we came here relatively late, so they were able to manage a table for us in a reasonable amount of time. They were very accommodating, and their service was great throughout our dinner, and so for that I gave major props.  They have a pretty wide selection for the AYCE, which I think came out to about ~$26 a person. We got mostly nigiri, and got almost one of everything. What I especially liked is that their proportions of rice to fish. There's much more fish and very little rice, BUT we started noticing that as we ordered more, they start packing on the rice a little more. Not horribly more, but it was significant enough for us to know that they wanted to fill us up haha. But even then, the quality of the fish was pretty good, especially for AYCE. Everything looked and tasted fresh. Even the Uni, which I'm usually a little iffy trying at an AYCE place, because typically AYCE sushi joints have old or not good quality Uni, but the uni here was pretty good. Not the best at it, but good enough to get that buttery taste that you crave from a GOOD piece of uni. The rolls are good also, but they're just like any other rolls.  They have a couple signature dishes. One of them was this watermelon roll, which is a small plate of little sushi rolls, but instead of having the rice and seaweed look, it was wrapped in thin slices of cucumbers with an assortment of some fish inside. It gave it a really crisp and light texture, which was very refreshing. I'd definitely recommend that. They have a couple other signature dishes (I can't remember what they were). I do remember that they were pretty good, but didn't stand out as much as this watermelon roll.  I'd come back, preferably with a smaller group so that I don't have to wait as long, or come late cause they're open until 3AM! And they have some good happy hour deals with some good hot sake!",

    "text": "Came here with some friends for late night munchies and this place was conveniently open and close. We ordered some nigiri and the rice portion is super small. Which is amazing, makes you less full so you eat more (no wonder you get a \"koma\"). The salmon already comes with lemon, which was convenient!  But the must try here is definitely their white tuna, sashimi roll, and seared tuna carpaccio. The food came in a fairly manner which allows you to pace yourself. Given that fact it also makes you fuller as time passes. The ambience of this place is nicely dim but is really small for an all you can eat place. Making it seem full and busy. So the wait might be a little longer due to the size of the place but it most definitely worth the wait. The wait is hardly a problem because they seem to have people in and out at a timely manner. The service here is fantastic, we adore our waitress! She was attentive and quick. If you're reading this ?? You go Glenn coco! ! Do you ! And stay golden!! But overall this place is a must come. The white tuna is so soft and smooth, tasting super fresh! While the seared tuna carpaccio had so much flavor with yum yum sauce and eel sauce making it sweet yet savory at the same time. While the sashimi roll may be small there is a flavorful punch to it due to the daikon radish they use to wrap the sashimi pieces. The only down side of this place is the dessert but it's still a good selection with ice cream and several mochi flavors. I mean honestly I don't really care much for desert due to the fact that I usually go get boba tea after sushi anyways.",

Unlike other sushi places, this place is pretty consistent with quality, taste, and service. The quality of the sushi  is very good. From the nigiri to the rolls, it's pretty damn good. Now, I'm not a huge sushi eater but have tried more than a few places and would definitely put this place in a top three. My girlfriend loves the garlic tuna and says it's one of the best. I personally like the shrimp tempura rolls, spicy crab, and also the terrayaki beef roll. I know some think beef and sushi don't go together. But what's not to like? Beef and rice! What's not to love.  Even though the place isn't the biggest, it has a good vibe and comfortable atmosphere. No matter how busy it gets, the servers are always smiling and seem happy to be there (whether that's True or not). Overall, I recommend this place to all my friends and would still keep recommending it.",

Second: When I ordered a Scalop hand roll from the menu, nowhere in the menu it said Scalop with imitation crab, so iinstead of having Scal op roll it was mostly imitation crab. The service was just ok, fish did not seem to be very fresh and rolls had a lot of rice in it. I would definatley not go back there again.",

I don't know what they did differently but wow has the food changed. I loved that they were very quick to get your orders out and that you can order half rolls here. The nigiri is my favorite here it was SUPER fresh and amazing everything we ordered was very tasty.

I would definitely come back for my friend if she wanted to come here. Other than that, I will stick to my regular spots with fresher fish and better service and variety.",

Fish to rice ratio is definitely the best by far for an AYCE sushi joint, it's almost like ur cheating.

The flavor was bland and I didn't even want to eat it anymore. So I had some left overs which I didn't know what to do with it. There California rolls are alright and so are there masago's. Nothing to special at this spot. For me, this place is way to over priced for the quality of fish that we are given. Not worth the money. After my experience, I don't think I'll eat here again.",

You don't just have one server, everyone makes sure you are taken care of. You have to try the seared tuna carpaccio! Garlic chips explode this dish! The Dynamite scallops are mouth watering! We had several orders of both. I think the negative comments of the wait may have been because they ordered baked items. Everyone knows those take longer..duhh. We were surprised when a server brought over a gift from the chefs. Tuna belly. ...it just melts on your mouth! Not part of the AYCE menu....a gift for us to try! I thought about not writing a fantastic review and keep this place to myself, but they really deserve it. You will not be disappointed!",

Yes the service sucks and is slow but the place was busy and you gotta cut them some slack. Fish is good not great but what you get is pretty awesome.  I liked their eel, most of the nigiri although the tuna wasnt the greatest (the white tuna was really good though), red snapper was pretty tasty too.  I am a big fan of the rolls ( I know it aint really sushi but....) I really liked the rainbow roll which had crab, avocado and I think mackerel,  Ika Tobiko Maki which was Squid & tobiko ( squid was soft and fluffy not rubbery)  and the  Spicy Hotate & Avocado Roll  which was a nice combo of  scallop & avocado ( it had a kick to it and the scallop was very delicate in texture).  I would stay away from the fillers of gyozo etc and that stuff is not worth filling up on.  I will definitely come back!",

I have been here several times at various hours and never experienced such horrible service. From waiting 25 minutes to be addressed (restaurant not 1/2 capacity) to having to ask for wasabi and ginger....it's not like I was in a corner...I was at the sushi bar for heaven sake watching others who came in after receiving friendly service. What's even more amazing is the staff assumed I couldn't understand them. SHAME on them for thinking I can't speak or understand Mandarin, perhaps YELP will address this ignorance!  In closing, what's more insulting is the server whom they replaced to make the situation more liking actually made it worse by inquiring if I had eaten all day and if I wanted a half of a refill on tap water... SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  Thank you for demeaning my aptitude and appetite!",

However, I'm not sure if it's because they're located in a plaza that many high school students hang out in or what, but any time we tried going there after the first couple months we'd been going, it was always crowded with hipster types and large groups of teens.  Their dining room is very small and I doubt it can accommodate any more than 20 people tops, including the sushi bar.  For this reason, while I haven't eaten there in a little over a year, I can only say that they're 'A-OK'.  Nice selection, but very limited on seating and you better be prepared for sitting amongst hipsters now that apparently \"sushi\" is a requirement to fit in with the hipster cliques.",

We  come here quite often but this will be our last. The waitress (the one with a nose piercing) was beyond rude and had an attitude. When we asked why our order was taking so long (30 minutes for one order) the waitress almost yelled at us saying there was only one server during this lunch hour, and at that time it wasn't that busy, only about 4 tables, and shouldn't taken that long because there were also 3 sushi men. She continuously ignored us and went inside the kitchen. After multiple attempts to have her take our order she finally came, when we ordered from the menu (all you can eat) she bluntly and rudely said no, when we asked why she almost mockingly said because they were out. I never had this kind of experience at any restaurant ever. The only thing that didn't take any time was when we asked for the check. If the owner happens to see this review, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! reconsider the waiters and waitresses you hire for your restaurant.  Overall this experience at Sushi Koma has been very bad especially the service today.",

The menu had the usual cut rolls, nigiri, hand rolls etc. there was something for everyone and we really enjoyed our food and the waitresses were great.

Since that visit, we couldn't stop talking it up to anyone who would listen. So, when we decided to do a summer trip to Vegas, the first thing we both thought was that we had to go back to Sushi Koma. Well...you know how you wake up in the middle of an amazing dream and you try to go back to sleep to continue the dream, but you never quite get the same experience? That's how this trip to Sushi Koma was. In fact, we kept trying different things in the hope that something, anything, would remind us of what we first experienced. There was one positive in a string of negatives- the tuna carpaccio- delicious! However, the other dishes were lacking. My mom wondered about the freshness of the fish, but to me it seemed the quality was poor. Also, there was a 5-10 minute time period where we seemed invisible to the 5 staff people working the small restaurant (with only us and one other party present). In fact, one waitress sat down at the sushi bar with her back to us- was she on break?! Needless to say, we won't be back, which is so disappointing since we thought we found a great, off the strip, place to eat.",

The reviews were fairly good and a couple of friends recommended this place.    We were seated fairly quickly and being very, very familiar with AYCE sushi joints, we ordered our first round of sushi with our drink order.  The drinks were served really quickly.    Because the tables are so close together (like about a couple of feet) you can't help to see and hear what your neighbors are ordering.  While waiting for our first sushi order our neighbors order another round of sushi (mostly nigiri), which they got in about 5 minutes.  We continued to wait for our first order.  Our other neighbors order a round of specialty rolls, which they got in about 5 minutes.  We continued to wait for our first order.  After about 15 minutes from time we placed our order the server did come out and apologize, saying the the sushi chefs were backed up.  Hard to believe when others are ordering and receiving their orders  right next to us.  We waited exactly 13 more minutes after the apology and decided to leave ( I know it was 13 minutes because I started the stop watch app on my phone).  Never tasted one bite of sushi.  We payed for our drinks, which they made sure to charge us and check the table to see if any food was actually delivered.  Guess the one star is for the great taste of our drinks (a coke and a Kirin Light)",

Right when we got there I ordered 4 rolls immediately. 1 full roll and all the others a half roll. My friends put in orders as well. After about 20 minutes all of my friends had received there orders except for me. I finally got my baked roll and politely asked what was going on. Well they switched servers for some reason but the first girl completely failed to tell the next girl what we had ordered. Speeding up to an hour later and I still had not received my HALF rolls when everyone else's orders were pretty much complete except one other person. FINALLY  I got another full roll...that was supposed to be half. I asked the girl what was going on yet again telling her I had ordered 3 half rolls. By this time I had told her 3 times what my beginning order was.  Then when I finally got my other 2 half rolls she rudely asked if we were done ordering and I preceded to tell her I was still waiting for my 3rd. It was never put in. We got the bill 30 minutes into our bill so we just paid and left. Let me tell you I am always one to tip but I definitely did not here. Oh and I did not even mention that the huge group behind us got ALL of their food and we sat before them. WORST SERVICE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS ANY LONGER.",

Everything we had was inventive, fresh and phenomenal. The pan- fried gyoza were crisped perfectly, and the seafood tostada was like a delicious fish taco with fresh salsa on a tortilla chip. The sashimi roll was just eh, but the tuna carpaccio is absolute MUST HAVE. Maybe the most delicious sushi dish I've ever had. I also had a variety of nigiri, each of which was furnished with some kind of garnish which kept it interesting (jalepeno for yellowtail, lemon for salmon, garlic and herbs for snapper. We also tried a few different rolls- Tiger, Big B, and Fish Paradise, all of which were good, but not as good as the appetizers and nigiri. For dessert, green tea mochi and plum wine ice cream were delish! Service was very attentive as well. All in all, the most excellent AYCE sushi in Vegas!",

    "text": "Well I guess they are use to an all you can eat sushi crowd. I asked for UNI and it was a complete melt down by the sushi apprentice. WE DON'T SERVE UNI, UNTIL DINNER. I'm like ok, says here 4pm is dinner time son. OK your error its 440pm now, I guess your in another time zone? I will order from the waitress. 1 cold sake from first waitress, pretty good sake. Then the first waitress disappears then another waitress arrives and says can I take your order. OK BAM there you have my order. I'm finished talking I just want to drink my sake in peace and quite. Buddha style! Then I get the sushi apprentice yelling at me. SIR CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? I was like son, I asked you for UNI and it never arrived. I have shut you down. So I will order from the waitress. Keep in mind this place was empty and the place is only 10 feet x 10 feet. The waitress then tells me he is new.  OK he's new... I forgive him. But wait he's not new according to the other employees what's going on here. Haha... You have to laugh. If you want micro / nano / tapas sushi this place is for you.... I'm pretty sure I will NOT be going back,  after the fiasco. I will say the second waitress was pretty good she said I ate like a bird. Saving them some money aka bird man. Just doing my part to save the sushi restaurant some money.  I approve this message J K KUHL.",

The only thing that disturbs me is the customer service. The hostesses were SO confused about seating three groups in a somewhat crowded restaurant. The size of the restaurant/capacity has not changed for what reason do you act like you've never done a day of this job before, it was just too awkward. Then the girl that took our order (which it also took forever to get her attention) did not take down our order right or forgot, three different orders of ours. It just takes too long to get someone's attention which is ridiculous. It's sad because I recommended this place to someone and now they will probably relay this experience. Too bad.",

    "text": "After a 4-5 hour drive from California to Las Vegas, me and my friends decided to have the AYCE dinner @ Sushi Freak. We actually found out about this place through Yelp and we had no idea how to get there, so we called the place up and the waitress who served us also gave us directions on how to get there. This place opened really late which is great for us since we arrived sometime after midnight to LV and were really hungry.   It was around 25 dollars per person for AYCE but I'm pretty sure we ate more than that. Our orders came in a very timely matter, there was almost always food on the table to keep our mouths busy. They charged gratuity for large parties so we didn't have to tip the waitress but I did anyways cause she was so awesome.  This place was off the LV strip so it wasn't packed with a bunch of people, the service was great and the nigiri was fresh. We even ordered albacore which was not even listed in the nigiri menu and weren't even charged extra for it. I'd suggest the halibut, red snapper and yellowtail nigiri. I would also suggest the dragon/spider roll . The waitress Judy was extremely friendly and would frequent our table to make sure she kept up with our orders as well as filling up my hot tea and our waters. Judy was pretty good looking too lol I wish I sat on the other side of the table so I could get a better view, oh well. What's not to like though? Good food, great service, cute waitress and a fair price.",

The service is good and very friendly. We moved recently and are still willing to drive the 35 minutes to get here because the ones around us don't even compare. This is my first review and I made sure that it was for this place because they deserve it.",

I thought this would be a great spot for me and my aunt to meet for the first time since we both love sushi. Well it soon turned out to be a disaster. Being someone who used to manage a restaurant I'm all for trying to make sure the bigger parties are accommodated for however I feel you should still make sure to accommodate the others seeking service too as poor service to one or two people could be far worse then poor service to a larger group. We had a party of 6+ sitting next to us who seemed to steal all the attention as it took us 20+ minutes to receive any of our orders and then only about 5-10 minutes for them to receive theirs. The worst part is there were 3 people in the back prepping food and still dishing out their orders fast and ours slow & last. I'm super embarrassed I even raved about this place after the horrible service we were provided today. Looks like we will be trying to find somewhere else for next time.",

    "text": "I would've loved to have given this place more stars, but the service was terrible. Went with a group of 6, four were doing AYCE, one just a la carte teriyaki chicken and the last was simply hanging with the group because they weren't hungry so they just had a drink. Our waitress brought us other people's orders, forgot to put ours in, all of us needed refills repeatedly, empty glasses sat on the table for 15 mins or more and that's probably an understatement. She was constantly texting on her phone, paying no attention to us. It was later at night and there were maybe 12 other people besides us that had two other waitresses waiting on them. We literally waited to be able to order our second rolls as she sat in a chair texting on her phone by the front door. Eventually I guess she got sent home and the other two waitresses tag teamed our table, but by then- our experience was less than stellar. It really put a damper on what was to be an enjoyable evening with friends. I don't drink much so I kept pouring my drink into my guy's bc he had nothing but ice chips in his cup for a long time. At one point she refilled one person's drink but left the remaining five of ours empty. She even copped an attitude when she brought us the wrong order for the third time- and we informed her we didn't order it. Three of us decided \"you know what, I don't care what she brings next- I'm eating it because I'm hungry!\" It took over 45 mins to get our first rolls and one was \"forgotten\" so that person sat watching the rest of us eat. We all just started sharing with one another at that point, because everyone was hungry and it was getting much later in the night than we intended to be staying. The last two waitresses who took over for Miss Text aholic, saved the night in such that it wasn't a completely ruined evening. Was not impressed and will not go back, I have been to this place more than once - we have had  better service at several other places.",

Got seated at the bar and ordered AYCE. Drinks were brought out promptly and the food was out within minutes or ordering. We had yellowtail (which was the best thing we ate tonight), salmon, and super white. Also ordered a Tiger Roll and a Rainforest Roll. Now, Tiger rolls at every other sushi joint I have ever been too have never put spicy mayo on top. I am not a fan of any kind of mayo on my sushi, and failed to noticed this when I ordered. My bad. However, it wasnt bad. Actually couldnt taste the mayo. Lucky me. Also, the Rainforest roll is made in almost the same way as Sushi Mon's JJ Roll. But it wasnt as good.   All and all, for the first order, it was pretty good. But this is where I drop 2 stars.   A few other people had come in since we sat down, but the place was far from packed. It took the waitress 15 minutes after us finishing the 1st order to place the next order. Very slow and sad service at this point. Ordered red snapper, albacore, halibut, and more yellow tail. The first 3 came out within minutes. A point for the chefs for being so quick. However, for these nigri they put some kind of blended up white substance on top of the fish, and top with the chives. Was was this white stuff on top? Ground radish with an onionish taste? Very gross. We choked it down. Let a nasty taste in our mouths.   Waitress came to get another order. Told her we were still waiting on the yellowtail. A few minutes later it came out.   Finished it off (getting rid of the bad taste from the other nigri). Ordered desert- Green tea Ice Cream and Strawberry mochi. Fast delivery, but both desert were already melting. The green tea ice cream tasted more like machi powder,very strong in flavor. Not my cup of tea.   Speaking of tea, the iced green tea is really good!! I recommend ordering it during the hot summer months.   I doubt I'll be back. Wish they had a bigger list of rolls. Sushi Mon is still the best.",

    "text": "I've had a my fair share of AYCE sushi places and this one tops it by far as THEE BEST AYCE SUSHI EVER. I'm from CA and I would definitely make a trip back out here to eat here. If you are out in Las Vegas, GO HERE! Your stomach will not regret it.  Prices: AYCE - $21.99 for Lunch & $25.99 for Dinner. As expected, but worth it if you have a big appetite or even on planning to order 3 rolls. There are no rounds, you can order as many times as you like.  Service: Awesome. Heard that this place was small, but was accommodated with seats right away. The staff are all very nice and they attend to you quickly. If there are multiple large groups of like 6 or more, it may take time to get in if it's busy. The staff make small talk, which I thought was pretty cool. Allows you to be comfortable  Food: Best I ever had. Appetizers were pretty good. Tuna carpaccio was something new to me, but it tasted really good. A must try. The tostada was like a combination of a poke/ceviche. The nigiri was what caught me. The quality and texture of the fish are on point. You can tell that the first are handled the right way.",

We got greeted right away and seated quick. We put in our order and right away we got our food. Really yummy. I think today was the most I ate and we ordered almost the whole menu, which is ridiculous for us. We hardly eat a lot of sushi but today it was too hard to resist. I definitely recommend this place and try their mussels and super Phil roll. Will update this when I come here a numerous time to compare my experience.",

Asked 2 different people to check on it and they just kept saying it was coming. Going on 50 minutes for 1 order. And we couldn't even be proactive and pay ahead of time. I am now late to grab my son. Again I come every single week they know me. Also the server was visibly sick and coughing. The search for a new sushi place begins again.

Everyone kept getting more and more food they were ordering while I got none. I told 3 servers. I was yelled at by one telling me what I ordered which was not correct. Still no food after 45 minutes. After the next table heard me complaining at the owner they said hey we got all your food... the servers and owners heard. I stated I'm done I'm not eating, my boyfriend can finish and were leaving.  Okay you messed up table numbers no big deal but you left instead of taking responsibility and left some poor man to deal with your mess. We tipped well, I was a server I know what it's like. Basically all you had to to was take responsibility tell me you screwed the table numbers and apologize there wouldn't have been a problem. I did not have a bill. My boyfriend's was comped I can't speak for the others, they are regulars there. We sat there waiting for checks for 20 minutes after our bill was handled and no-one brought them checks after they asked more than once, so I don't k ow what to tell you there.",

I think they have a secret menu because the Vegas freak isn't on the menu they have out but it's included in AYCE .

Service was wonderful, waitresses were friendly and helpful, the food just kept coming, and the finished plates were quickly cleared off the table.  The fish was very fresh and all ingredients were top-notch... from the salmon, tuna, and halibut, to the shrimp, fresh water eel, crab, and scallops! We also ordered miso soup, deep fried oysters, deep fried calamari (both were light and crispy and came with their own sauces!), gyoza, and spicy edamame (hot & yummy!)!  I personally feel the Seared Tuna Carpaccio wins all around.  Holy shiitake! This dish is incredibly  delicious! Perfectly prepared and topped with crispy garlic chips... PERFECTION.  I asked the waitress if they do anything special for birthdays (pointing at my teen... lol) and she enthusiastically told me not to worry because she'll take care of it... Awesome!  AYCE lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. Very comparable to other AYCE sushi places here in Las Vegas! This is the closest place to me, so I'm absolutely THRILLED!  Keep in mind the place is quite small so it looks like it fills up quickly. Also, some items on the menu allows only one order per person and only one dessert per person (clearly marked on menu).  Sushi Koma gained 4 new fans in us!!!  Definitely bookmark!",

Some of my favorite items on the menu are the Tuna Carpaccio, the Seafood Tostada, Dynamite special, 3-10 roll, New York roll, PCH roll and the Sam's volcano roll just to name a few. They have Wi-Fi and stay open really late which makes it a good  place to eat and chill out for a little bit!",

Because there's not a whole lot of floor space, I feel as though this is a restaurant better suited to smaller parties. If you must bring a lot of people, do yourself a favor and make a reservation so the staff has time to accommodate your party (and so you're not waiting forever).   Sushi quality was fresh but nothing really stood out for me. Just your typical AYCE fare.  I was really sad that they limit you to one type of dessert! I guess it's a way to keep costs down. But seriously, can't a girl eat her weight in mochi ice cream once in a while?   Anyway. The food is good here, so I'll try it with a smaller group next time.",

The waitresses are all very nice and friendly.  They were very eager to take our orders and we got our order in a quick manner.  They kept checking on us to make sure we got our order and doing great.    Since I don't eat rice so I tried mostly the special items that only one per customer.  The seared tuna, dynamite, fried oyster, seafood tostadas were all great.  I especially liked the seaweed salad because I think they add sesame dressing on it.  So the price is very reasonable for $25.99 per person.  If I were eat this much on the strip, I would be paying at least $100 for the two of us.  Great food and great experience.",

We got AYCE, and after waiting over half an hour and 4 large sakes in, other tables that came after us finished eating and we still didn't not get our food other than edamame, and was then told they had lost our order. We put our order in again, and at this point the food was all mixed up and we didn't know what belonged to who. After putting in our second order, the food didn't come out, so we had asked them to cancel it since we were full from sake and waiting.  I want to give credit to the waitresses though, they were nice and apologetic, and the sushi was good. Just wished the food came out continuously so we could actually enjoy and take advantage of our AYCE.  Memorable items were the angry edamame, the brie and grape quesadilla, white tuna, and the seared tuna carpaccio. :)",

I consider myself a very picky eater, but this restaurant exceeded my expectations.  We got the all you can eat deal ($22 for lunch, $26 for dinner), you have to get this deal if you normally order an appetizer and at least two sushi rolls. I normally won't touch the sushi bar in a buffet setting.  This restaurant let you order from their actual menus (you can also order individual dishes), which means you get the quality.  I was afraid the owner wouldn't like it if we order more than 4 dishes each. As it turned out, she constantly ask if we have enough and would like to order more....  food is A+ and service is A+.  Must go to place if you like sushi rolls.  We will be coming back after our trip to the Antelope Canyons in a few days.",

With such a small place they took our group of 8 and got us down. They even served out food fast. Unless they wanted us out cause we can eat.   One thing I like about Koma is the uni. The uni can come with quail egg. OMFG love love that. It is two per person for the AYCE special. The food was all delish even when I asked for NO crabmeat in my spider hand roll. YES they have a spider \"hand roll\" that is also another plus for me when they have hand rolls that I love.   Our table was always full and always cleaned quick by the awesome staff. They have such good service and friendly workers. The food is great and they have cool types of rolls.   Parking is in a lot shared by other stores. Wifi wasn't working.   If they didn't put you in a Koma they didn't do their job!!!!",

My favorite were the eel nigiri, salmon nigiri, yellow tail nigiri, shrimp tempura etc.  Too bad that the uni nigiri is only for dinner (we were having lunch here)... I wish that I could have it.   I highly recommended not to order the beef teriyaki, because it tasted like yoshinoya (I don't pay $20 for yoshinoya!).   With dessert, 1 person is only allowed to order 1 dessert, and the options are ice-cream or mochi! I had the red bean mochi, and it tasted great! (Be careful with the brain freeze!)   Service was a little slow as they only have 2 servers for such a big restaurant! Not the servers' fault for slow service, but the management! The servers worked hard!",

    "text": "I went to Sushi Koma some time ago a few years back and I had a pretty great experience. I didn't get a chance to write a review then so I guess I will now.  They had a previous, smaller location that I had gone to, and I guess they have since moved to a bigger one in the same plaza more towards the back end. This was apparently done ~2-3 months ago. From what I remember, I do like this newer place better. It has a lot more space for not only people, but also for decor, and the sushi bar is definitely bigger.  The place looks very nice on the inside and has a more traditional feel than the previous place. I feel that I get easily detracted by tacky decor and contrasting wallpaper, although I did not feel that there. However, I did question, not quite object, the need for a big screen TV at a sushi restaurant (I believe there may even be more than one).  We came as a party of 3 with a hankering for sushi at 1:30 AM on a Tuesday, so I can't say I know what service is like during peak times. We were seated immediately and our orders were taken very soon after. Our server was very kind and was patient of our questions and orders. (Yes, you can do half rolls!)  The quality of their fish is definitely better than most places I've tried here in town, and the price is all relatively the same for AYCE here in Las Vegas. For dinner price, it was $25.95 per person, which I believe is a great price for a decent amount of variety and quantity. Their appetizers hit the spot, and the hand rolls taste quite fresh. Most of these are pretty standard, although you MUST try the Tuna Carpaccio!  I HIGHLY recommend the Big B Roll! (Although it's only one roll per person.) It's like any shrimp tempura roll but added with teriyaki beef on top. It's definitely something different but combine that with the \"chef's special\" sauce and it somehow works very well together. I also enjoyed their Bank Roll, PCH, Ninja, Rainbow Roll, and Tropicana Roll. I'll definitely make it a point to try some different things on my next visit. The ratio of fish-to-rice on the rolls were decent and I saw no attempt to cram a ton of seaweed and rice with very few protein in between.  For me, the food was pretty great, but the service is what really made our night spectacular. Our server's name was Ben, and I hope we get him again next time! We were always taken care of whenever he was needed and he never forgot us when it came to more rolls and refills on drinks. Unlike most servers, he is also not very stiff nor is he shy at making good conversation with you without also forgetting to attend to his duties. VERY fun guy, indeed, and he was super easy to talk to from the moment we were seated.  My only complaint is that while the music is good and fun, it is WAY too loud. Thankfully, the friends I went with were very vocal and laughed so hard that we didn't mind too much in the end. But if you're trying to have a more quiet dinner, this may not exactly be the place for it.  I can't wait to come back! :)",

    "text": "This poor rating for Sushi Koma is really a poor rating to all of you Yelpers out there.   To be fair, maybe it should just be for the 20 or so people dining at Sushi Koma this afternoon, when my friend and I were there.   Never mind the fact that I bragged about Sushi Koma to my friend, and won the battle of whose sushi place we would visit today.  Never mind the fact that I ate at Sushi Koma last week and it was good. And never mind the fact that every other AYCE place in town is going down hill too.  AYCE sushi in Vegas is going down the toilet.   Let me explain:  The rice was crap. That's all, enough said.   Two things I am most disappointed about: the fact that no one else had a problem with the rice, and they tried to charge me for two AYCE, even though we stopped after the first order came out. In the end, they finally comp'd one of the two meals, but if you added up the a la cart price for the sushi we did received (crap though it was), it would still not have come to one AYCE price.   So, basically we got ripped off twice.  Today's visit was a 0 star, but I know Sushi Koma can do better (or at least they used to), so I am being generous with 2 stars.  But to all my fellow Yelpers: come on people, we deserve better than this. Stand up and start demanding better sushi, including the rice.  And to all the AYCE sushi joints out there - STOP PRE-CUTTING YOUR FISH! It increases the surface area that is exposed to oxidization and accelerates the deterioration - in other words, it makes it nasty.",

Its much closer to me than Goyeomon so we thought we would try it out since a friend wanted to go. The interior is simple & small w/ nice high ceilings & you are definitly not sooo close to each other that you could hear the next table gossip.  . The first time we ate here we LOVED it... the rice was PERFECT & the fish had that fresh texture that i love. The second time we ate here we were OK w/ it..... the rice was MUSHY but the fish was still that fresh texture that i love. The THIRD time we came to eat here it was because my friend said he would buy us dinner since we haven't been eating out for 5 months so we decided why not go to AYCE sushi..... it was sooo DISAPPOINTING.... the fish was fishy and mushy... the rice was like eating mushy oatmeal... the tempura was DISGUSTINGLY cold & old & took FOREVER to come out. . Service was GREAT the first two visits & our server was MELISSA.... the third time.... OMG ... my miso never came out until i asked 3x... my shrimp tempura never came out.... i asked for no carrots in my salads but all 3 of them had carrots....  . Maybe i will try ONE more time next year...",

    "text": "Ah sushi.  We haven't had sushi in about 6 months!   On Thursday afternoon, we popped in to Sushi Koma, as we were in the area, and were super hungry.   First impression:  This place is small.  I don't necessarily mind small, it was cozy...but if I'm honest, I was worried that the servers were going to hit us with their trays a couple of times.  The tables are small, and for people who order a lot at a time (like we do), it makes things really cramped.    Service was super.  The girls were nice, and very prompt.   The chefs were on it with the orders.     The food was standard.  The rice was a little wonky on a few of the nigiri pieces...like unable to pick up with chopsticks because it would fall part, wonky.    But the fish was really tasty.    Nothing stood out too me as stellar or spectacular like some other sushi spots, except the tuna carpaccio.  That was amazing.  The brie and grape quesadilla was interesting.  I'd have liked a bit more brie, as I couldn't really taste any.    I'm bugged by the fact that they don't offer all of their dessert options with the AYCE.  They have a green tea cheesecake that I wanted to try, but dessert for AYCE is ice cream or mochi only.   It wasn't clearly marked that they aren't available, and I was really disappointed.    A definite A-OK vote from me.  Not amazing or stellar, but very nice service, and good fish.  I'd come back, if I'm in the area, but won't go out of my way to eat here.",

The food was better than any we have had in the valley, and the amazing service makes this the best place. We waited a few minutes to be seated and never waited again. Every single person who works there will ask of you need something if you look like you might. We had never seen a few of the things on their menu and had a few questions, and I am a bit of a picky eater. This was no problem for them. They had all the right answers and great suggestions of some things to try. If you don't like something in a roll, they will swap it out with what you want. They will even make 1/2 rolls (of most things) if you just ask. They went above any beyond to make us regular customers, and they succeeded. The only thing I can say that went somewhat wrong was that 2 of the appetizers we ordered didn't come out- I looked at one of the waiters and someone was at the table. I said they didn't come out and they apologized sincerely and within a few minutes, both were hot on our table. The manager as well came over to apologize and make sure we were ok. We will be back again very soon!",

We were a big party with 3 kids and she never once seemed annoyed or anything.   The ONLY issue I have is that our runner came out a few times not knowing what roll he was giving us.

    "text": "We are not from a city where \"all you can eat sushi\" place is really a thing. My husband is actually a sushi chef, so we weren't expecting too much and were very pleasantly surprised! I generally don't review sushi- as I don't eat fish and a veggie roll is pretty standard any where you go but my husband really enjoyed it and he is very picky. The restaurant was very clean, modern and the staff seemed to be in good moods.  Knocked off a star for 2 reasons: 1. They charged us an add-on fee to AYCE price for getting soy wraps on my 3 veggie rolls which is silly when you aren't getting fish. Pretty sure the fish costs way more than cucumbers on a soy wrap. The veggie options were limited to a cucumber, avacado, and veggie roll so honestly the AYCE option probably wasn't worth it for me.    2. We had our 2 year old with us who eats like a picky bird and they didn't want us sharing so we had to order rice and soup separate (and waste most of it) for him when I could have just given him a few bites of mine.   Overall though, it's still a win because our bill was about $55 instead of our usual $100 sushi bill and my husband ate A LOT of fish!",

The owner and staff are always welcoming and my family enjoys going here too. My parents are extremely attentive to detail with food due to their culinary background and always talk about the freshness of the fish and the variety in the cuts of the fish that we get. I love going here and the new location is so cute. The service was good before but it continues to improve over time. My parents appreciate that the owner recognizes them and always takes time to talk to them and see how they are doing. It is extremely reasonably priced for the quality of food and the service. I always recommend Sushi Koma as the AYCE spot!",

They have a fabulous tuna carpaccio with thin slices of garlic. Also, they have a kids menu that can either be a la Carte or all you can eat, sweet! I just wish they wouldn't have a limit on the really good stuff but it's part of their deal.  It's a must go to place if you like sushi and appreciate all you can eat, you won't be disappointed!",

I've live in Vegas for 7 years and this is one of my favorite go-to spots for sushi and to bring friends and family from out of town.  My husband and I have had over 50 meals here and we have never had any stomachs problems after eating here (not the same for other AYCE around town).  Price is about a $1-2 more than other AYCE, but for the quality of food you get here, so worth it!  You get one order of uni (sea urchin), amaebi  (sweet shrimp and fried head) even during lunch.  That right there seals the deal for me.  Quality of fish is excellent! Flavors of the rolls are balanced. Servers are always friendly with smiles (especially Judy). Orders could take some time to get to you because they have a very tiny sushi counter, so be a little patient.  Most of the staff have been here since opening / for a few years, which speaks volume for the chef owner Chris in terms of how his staff are treated.  It's really nice to see.",

When I asked why was it taking so long the response I got was \"I put in a big order for this table\" I said I realize that but I ordered after she did and all the rolls I ordered came out. A few people at our table had to keep asking for drink refills, where was their order, for them to clear our table etc.   We were all divided on the servers, some were nice while there was a few very rude. And the rice was over cooked. I can say I won't be back there.",

Went today with a group of about 10 and our server didn't seem to keen on serving us. One half of the table got phenomenal service, while my half was pretty shitty. If you are going to double team a table, make sure both servers are on it and not just one of them. I think I would've had a better experience with the one server who was attentive rather than the two team server. Like I said, the one half had great service, while my half pretty much was left in the dust.",

We were waiting for sooo long to receive the 1 roll he ordered. I received my orders, but I did have to remind waiters because items were missing. We never got his order and it was such a long wait, our waiter asked us if we were ready for dessert!! I said he hasn't received his food. She apologized. We waited for another really long time, still no food. Another waiter asked us if we wanted dessert. At this point, you know the service is terrible when 2 waiters have asked if you're ready for dessert and you still haven't been given your food....  Roll finally came out (it was a baked roll) and was freezing cold. Not sure how long it had been ready for. The waitress apologized and said she's new. Paid full AYCE prices for 1 cold roll for my boyfriend. They were nice and did ice cream for his birthday but they brought it out right after his roll. They didn't give him time to order more knowing he never received his food in the first place. The ice cream and 1 roll was not worth the AYCE price they charged us. Whole experience was very bad. I also want to add that management was right there and very aware of what was happening and did NOTHING. Save yourself the bad service and cold rolls and eat elsewhere.",

After a bit we started to notice the service was a bit slow and the chefs always seemed overwhelmed.  Although the food is very good, we started to feel a bit jipped when we would go.  After about a year and a half we decided to give this place another shot since they have late night sushi available.  We went on a Sunday night around 11:45pm-ish.  This place is always busy so we expected to wait a bit, and we were okay with that.    We left the restaurant around 1:30am and I only received one roll and my boyfriend only received two rolls.  The waitress did notify us that the chefs were a bit behind but we had no idea they were that behind.  It was very weird because when looking around no one was getting rolls, only appetizers from the back kitchen.  I would feel better if I saw the chefs pushing out rolls and we just had to wait our turn, but no one was getting rolls.  We saw at least three couples cancel their orders and leave.    It's very sad because Sushi Koma has so much potential.  The food is delicious!  I have loved all my appetizers and rolls, when I'm able to receive them.  It's a service issue.  I do not want to wait an hour and a half for one sushi roll.",

Edamame was cooked to perfection, miso soup was great, and they never let you go without wasabi, ginger, etc. We came on a busy night and the service was impeccable, we got our food quick, and the owner was very invested in what was going on. Sushi/rice makes you so thirsty and our glasses were always full. It's also super clean which is big for me. It's a nice place to go for a date or even casual lunch/dinner. I absolutely love it.

My boyfriend's brother, who lives in Vegas, suggested this place as he lives less than five minutes away. We were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant did not appear too busy. We all got green tea, which was perfect for the cold weather. It was the best I ever had and greenest tea I've ever seen! We shared the Chef's Specials and fried calamari. The Chef's Special came with our choice of sushi (we chose the California Roll) and eight pieces of various sushi. My boyfriend's mom ordered the Tempura Udon, which came out hot and fresh. I love the thick udon noodles. Just a tip though, make sure to eat the tempura right away or else you'll end with soggy tempura in your soup and the batter comes of off easily. I had a carrot tempura and it was sitting there for a whole, the batter came off and I ended up eating the carrot by itself.   This place is perfect for drinks and munchies, or late-night dinner like for me, my boyfriend and his mom since we took the late flight to Vegas. They have fantastic customer service! The staff was friendly, prompt and attentive throughout our visit. We were greeted when we entered and left the restaurant and checked upon consistently.  They have a variety of sushi and other items to choose from.   Overall, this is the best sushi place that I have ever been to. I will be back again if I'm in Vegas!",

After a 20 minute wait they finally seat us.  We had other customers at tables on both sides of us, my knees were able to touch theirs. Now I am only 5'8 so it's not like my legs are super long.  I had to sit with my chest against the table because we were positioned to close to the table behind us. Before we were done being seated we asked for two waters since we had already been waiting.  After 15minutes our server came back with our waters and started to take our order.   We were starting to have a bad vibe about this place so we decided we will take it easy at first with the ordering. My girlfriend started with 2 orders of sea urchin and myself got 1 crunchy rolls.  After 20 more minutes they finally brought out 4 crunchy rolls and no sea urchin.  We tried to tell the server the mistake but they turned their back on us and went into the kitchen.  Right there we should of got up and left, but we were hungry and tired of waiting.  We start digging into the crunchy rolls(which my girlfriend is not too fond of) and only after 2 reminders did they bring out her Sea Urchin(and only brought out 1!!!) along with an order of Tuna Nigiri she told the server.  The tuna reaked. No other way to put it.  She was able to drag her chopsticks lightly against it and have the fish fall apart. Absolutely disgusting.    We decided to get up and pay.  It took them 10 minutes to help us at the cash register. They even tried to charge us the full price for 2 AYCE.  After a bit of arguing, and even telling the cashier I would happily pay the bill if she takes a bite of the tuna we received, they finally lowered the bill to around 30$. We left with and had no appetite to eat anything else.   Now yes, we understand the wait times, and we can even forget about the cramped space. However, for people saying this is the best sushi spot in Vegas, I can only question if you were even at the same restaurant that we were.  The servers and hostess's were very friendly, and seemed like they were trying their best. They are the reason I gave it two instead of one star. Fish was so bad I actually had to finally post my first review.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite AYCE in town. Large portions of fish with every order, a lot of AYCE restaurants will try to skimp on the fish. My favorites include their yellowtail carpaccio and their fresh fish rolls. Large selection of sake and a lot of original rolls. Their new location (same shopping center) is so much bigger allowing more staff and seating so there is no longer a wait or service issue. It's decor is swanky and is definitely an upgrade from their old space. Danica is the best waitress and gives exceptional service!",

Quality of the fish was great, although the rolls aren't as creative as JJANGA and I feel like Goyemon has the same quality of fish AND more innovative rolls. We tried a little of everything though and it was all satisfactory. We received a complimentary salmon belly from the chefs and that was the best item I had all night. Skip the plum wine ice cream, tasted like cough syrup!  I felt that the service was excellent though- kept refilling our drinks all night and were very pleasant and attentive.",

    "text": "Oh gosh, Sushi Koma is too good.  I am a huge nigiri lover so dried, disgusting fish is a big no no. I consistently order the same thing from sushi places so it is easy for me tell which place has better quality fish. My order is usually salmon, tuna, yellow tail, and scallop. I have never had bad quality fish from Koma and Sushi Koma is the only place other than Goyemon that I've been to that offers fresh scallop on consistent bases. A big part of nigiri is the rice and I have to say Koma's rice is pretty darn delicious even consumed by itself. So if you are a nigiri lover, this is definitely the place for you. One thing though, if you dont like lemon on your salmon or pepper on your yellow tail, just like them know you want nigiri with no toppings. I quiet like the toppings but some people may not.  My girlfriend and I are not big time roll eaters because my girlfriend is from Japan and she does not like that creamy stuff and I just like really fresh fish but of we did order rolls we would go with Todd roll, dragon roll, and tiger roll. Todd roll is definitely the best roll though.   Sushi Koma doesn't have a huge appetizer selection which might be problematic for some people. They do, however, offer some very unique items which some people may find interesting. To me, a nigiri eater, as long as seaweed salad, miso soup, and baked mussels are there, fish quality is more important than anything.   Service is a huge bright spot for Koma. Everyone is so friendly that it's hard to not love the place.   Overall, a fantastic AYCE sushi place for nigiri lovers!!! I live like 40 minutes away but I am addicted to getting SUSHI KOMA!!!!!!!!!",

We both did the AYCE. The selection of rolls and items on the AYCE menu were great. Lots of variety and something for everyone. We were so excited to try many of the rolls that we may have ordered too many. They found out it was my birthday thanks to my husband, and the majority of the staff came to our table to sing me Happy Birthday, and brought me an amazing ice cream sundae. On par with everything else, the ice cream was of course delicious. The customer service throughout our time there was great. They were very attentive and we never had an empty glass. I also did notice that there was no '1 hour time limit' blurb on the AYCE menu. We were conscious of how much time we were there, but I didn't feel as rushed to finish my meal as I did at other places. The restaurant is on the smaller side, but the use of space is well done.The decor is industrial modern, and the music they play overhead is a perfect volume. We will definitely be back.",

Immediately my friend and I ordered Kirin light and we both did AYCE.  We tried a few, loved the garlic tuna and yellowtail.  We also tried the spicy garlic ponzu, that I have to say is better than the plain wasabi and soy sauce!!  We got 2 special toro complimentary from the Chef to try which was very good.  Food was coming thru and service was great but then 45 minutes in, the server stop coming around and basically we felt ignored.  By the time we FINALLY got their attention we were already full from waiting around and was dying of thirst!  At closing, our bill was $73, due to their downfall on service I tip them $10 (paid on my credit card)  The shocking part is they had the audacity to take $15 tip from my account!!!!!!!!  Now this had pissed me off!!!!!!  How shady and untruthful these employees are??!!!!!!!  THEY CAN EAT MY $5 EXTRA TIP CAUSE KARMA'S A BITCH! MAYBE THEY CAN PUT THAT $5 TOWARDS GETTING A BIGGER PLACE AND HIRING HONEST WORKERS!..... Would I return... HELL NO!!!  I rather stick with the #1 sushi on town....\"NAKED FISH\"",

    "text": "Back when this place was owned and operated as Brian's Beach Sushi (then later as Sushi Freak), the food quality was superb and portioned accordingly. Nowadays, despite the good service, the food quality and portions is merely but a shadow of its former self. And at the end of the day, you always judge a restaurant by the food they serve not just by how it's served. We always ordered the limited quantity sashimi roll, tuna carpaccio, uni and sweet shrimp sushi. I say limited because despite the place being ALYCE, these items can only be ordered once--and that's fine as long as the portions are good. The thing is, now they have decided to make the sashimi roll half the size (for comparison, the roll slices were dollar-sized before and now they are quarter-sized), the tuna carpaccio plate went from a foot-long serving plate to a small petri dish, and the same downsizing goes with everything else compared to what it was when Brian ran the place. It's understandable if you reduced the price and thus reduced your portions to stay profitable, but I rather would pay more than get skimped on. In any case, I suppose there are other better options out there and we'll be going less and less to this place if they continue the downward trend of lesser quality (and OMG they rice-pack their sushi topped disproportionately with teeny fish!).",

    "text": "For food: 5 stars. For service: 3 stars is generous. My party of three went to Sushi Koma on a busy Friday night. We placed our orders (2 AYCE dinners, and one dinner entree for our non-sushi eater.) We ordered just a few things to get started, and were impressed when not five minutes later the first part of our order rolled out: a couple of rolls, and a gyoza app for our non sushi eater. We tucked in, looking forward to a nice meal. (OMG, tuna carpaccio with roasted shaved garlic! Amazing!) It was a busy night, but the place is small, and there were three chefs working the bar, and four servers, who were very attentive and sweet, BUT... totally disorganized.   All four of the servers seemed to be working our table, and while one of them would come around every few minutes to ask if we'd like to order something else, we had to keep replying that unfortunately, we were still waiting on items we'd already ordered and didn't want to order more than we could eat. There seemed to be no centralization of orders, and while having four attentive, very friendly servers is awesome, having just one server who made sure that our orders came out correctly and in a timely fashion would have been better. We had to ask for the rest of our order five times, and our non sushi friend waited about 45 minutes for his chicken teriyaki bowl. We were there for over two hours, and while the food was excellent, the efficiency and accuracy of the service was not.  One of the servers later apologized and explained that our entire second round order was given to another table by mistake. We waited about half an hour with no items delivered. With AYCE, at least you're not going to be charged for something you ordered, but didn't receive, but it's still annoying. We eventually got everything we ordered, but wouldn't have if we hadn't kept track of it ourselves. The food was wonderful, and the service was well intentioned and friendly, so I'm willing to give them another try, but I won't come when I'm in a hurry, or if there's someone I want to impress. I want to spend my meal enjoying my food, and not tracking down orders because one of my dining companion hasn't gotten his entree.   Tuna carpaccio, seafood tostada, sashimi roll, and chicken teriyaki apps are a must! The Elephant roll and Stephanie rolls were great!",

    "text": "First off - this an an AYCE joint. Lunch $22, Dinner $26. It's open until 3am!  Onto the food! This place has some interesting menu items for sure. Brie and grape quesadilla? Where did that even come from? Still, I can't knock it because I did not try it. When you sit down, they'll bring out some deliciously salted hot edamame which is a perfect nom before the storm that is AYCE.  Their nigiri list includes all of the usual suspects and some off the menu items such as garlic tuna and Cajun albacore. One of the stars of the menu is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which is really a tataki, not carpaccio at all. It has a lovely sear and is topped with green onion, garlic chips, ponzu and yum yum sauce. I'd recommend skipping the yum yum sauce. Highlights for the nigiri: Ono, hamachi, hotate, Cajun albacore and maguro. Skip the tamago - it isn't made in house. The tako is also not worth ordering, it's super tough.  Unfortunately, this place seems to be hit or miss. I've been twice in the same week and the first time was unbelievably  good and fresh! Upon eating the ono (super white tuna) I realized how watery all of the other fish I've been eating is! The second time around was a total miss and I only ate four orders of nigiri which is a record low for me. So if you go, hopefully it's a good night, because when it's good, it is a-maz-ing. Best quality fish I've had for Las Vegas AYCE.  Another noteworthy aspect of this restaurant is the little touches they add to each order of nigiri. Serrano chile for the hamachi, lemon slices for the salmon. This can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Every now and then a garnish to compliment the fish is welcome by me, but when every order is garnished, it becomes too much and I'd rather focus on the fish.  Other hot menu items: The gyoza- I'd skip it, it's only decent. The shrimp tempura- smaller than usual shrimp, slightly heavy and greasy batter. The spicy tuna hand roll (with avocado)!- the spicy tuna here has a distinct Korean funk about it; it's heavily seasoned and redolent of gochujang.  Oh, if you like rolls, there was a large selection conveniently separated into fried, baked, shrimp tempura etc. sections for ease of finding what you want.",

Anyway, I have to say that this place delivers. Their hamachi was pretty fresh, and their appetizers and selection had a lot of variety.

The owner offered free food, you didn't get to pick though  whatever number you had determined which dish you'd get. That was the first time I tried the Vegas roll. Super delicious. The only down side to this restaurant is the size. It's tiny and when it gets busy it gets way too crowded, and also they do not offer happy hour just ayce. My favorite rolls are the tiger roll, and mountain roll. Just enough sauce & full of great flavor. Fish is fresh too! The servers are super friendly. I usually also don't like getting sushi to go because I feel like it just doesnt taste the same (I know I'm weird) BUT sushi koma is different. We just ordered a couple rolls, egg rolls, and edamame to go & I loved it!",

Brian and the boys behind the sushi bar kept it coming in a timely fashion as well with some fantastic banter.  Our server Jessika was on point as well.  We never had to ask for anything and she was very friendly as well.  Kudos to Chris though. I hadn't been to the establishment in around a year (my apologies). He  recognized me and came and said hello! Furthermore he refunded me money from my last stay, saying I was overcharged last time was there.   Wowzers! I tip my hat to Chris and the entire Koma crew.  Honesty and great service will keep me coming back!!",

    "text": "Another great AYCE sushi bar to add to my list!   The name's now been changed to Sushi Koma because another restaurant federally trademarked 'Sushi Freak.' The place is a bit small, sitting up to maybe 30 people at most. My friend and I were immediately greeted by the sushi chef as we walked in. Prices were pretty standard' the AYCE lunch is $21.95, for dinner it's $25.95.   I found myself eating more of the appetizers and nigiri than the rolls. The Tuna Carpaccio is to die for, sadly it's only 1 order per person. The Sashimi Roll was alright, but to me it lacked flavor. I was surprised they didn't have Agedashi Tofu on their menu since it's usually a pretty popular appetizer. The Yellowtail nigiri is a must-order, in fact, all of their nigiri was fresh and tasty. They don't skimp on each slice either, unlike some other places I've been to. The rolls were good too, but I only had room in my stomach to try 3 half orders, so I will definitely try more next time.   Other than the fresh fish, what stood out to me the most was the great service. The 2 waitresses were very attentive and patient, always checking in to make sure plates were being cleared and drinks were refilled. And they didn't have a fake attitude, they were genuinely nice about serving us, which is something you don't see much of these days.   Overall, great food, great service, I'll be back soon!",

They let you choose if you'd like to sit at the bar or table. I sat at the bar and the sushi chef, I believe his name was CJ, welcomed us as well. Our waitress was extremely friendly, she even helped my daughter in her high chair.  Throughout our time there, they were very attentive. They made sure we had water, someone was there to take our order, and cleaned up our plates right when we were done. I loved how not one waitress helped a table, but all the waitresses helped each other out. You can really tell they got along well. The food was amazing! I'm really not into raw sushi rolls but the waitress suggested a raw roll that's good and you can't really tell it's raw. She was right! I couldn't even tell it was raw. I love how everything taste so fresh. I love how they had a kids menu. It was simple but simple is perfect for kids eating at a sushi spot. The prices are reasonable for an AYCE sushi place. It was just an overall great dining experience and can't wait to try it again.",

    "text": "OK, ladies and 'gents.. This is formally my very first review about anything good or bad and I am proud to say that it goes not only to a restaurant, but to a sushi spot that I have dubbed my very own getaway. Let me start out with the service first and foremost. When the time comes that you feel the need for GREAT; and I mean GREAT nigiri, then please step on in to this little hidden gem that has undergone new management (thank the good Lord), and is now titled comically: SUSHI KOMA. There you will be greeted happily and sincerely by your server/hostess/cashier/she-does-it-all and they call her \"Wes\". Yeah, I have no idea what it's short for, so don't ask. Not only is she sweet and humble but she knows how to keep the drinks coming and prevent you from wanting anything at all. The manager/owner and his assisting sushi chef greet you very happily as well and it almost makes you forget about how small it is inside or the fact that it used to be home of infamously horrible place called Brian's Beach Sushi. Almost. Until you look at the broad menu of beautiful items which most are very familiar and some had me second guessing my sushi infatuation? You then realize that both sides of the menu are included in their all you can eat lunch and dinner special which is $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner. This had me very excited to say the least because it includes some of my favorites such as tuna carpaccio and baked green mussels and the lovely tostadas! Green tea is nice and the rolls that we had were wrapped in a very thin layer of fresh rice which my husband loved and so did I since I'm not a huge fan of rice to begin with. Almost fire roll, Fish paradise roll and sashimi rolls are the only \"rolls\" I could eat over and over again... however, I would be in Heaven if I could get never ending servings of their tostadas and tuna carpaccio. the baked mussels were to my liking because they didn't over power it with all of the \"filler\" ingredients and so that leaves you with the salty ocean taste which is the reason why you eat shell fish in the first place. Make no mistake about it, this place had to go above and beyond to prove it's name and provide us with a lasting experience great enough to make me take time out of my busy everyday schedule so I could provide you with this \"yelp\". so is it a favorite/ ABSOLUTELY. When will we be going back? Every weekend. (Were only about 10 minutes away.) Oh' and a wonderful touch to it all was that \"Wes\" memorized our names after eating and talking there for over 2 hours... Pretty impressive, given the fact that I never formally introduced ourselves,she overheard us calling eachother's names out while entering the restaurant. You gotta love a place like that! Sushi Koma; one of Vegas's best kept secrets...",

I take that back..it's hard to say which is my favorite because everything is so good. Tuna carpaccio is a must-try! The fish tastes fresh & is better than other places that I have tried.  The servers are always friendly and appear to be happy in general. I say this because another AYCE place I recently tried I experienced the worst customer service ever. (Sorry Sushi Koma...I didn't mean to cheat & I now regret that I went somewhere else). My friends, family, and I have to eat here at least once a month. Don't forget to get a stamp card. I've had at least 5 free sushi dinners from that card. Keep up the great work and please don't ever take the sashimi roll off of your menu.",

It had sooooooo much potential. But it feel short. One, not enough Brie. It is called Brie and grape. Two, size was TINY. I mean minuscule. When she served it I thought \"where the hell is the rest of it???!!!\".  So, tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy portion almost no Brie and they charge $8.50. That reallllllly put me off. However, the salad with celery dressing was yuuuuummmmmmm. The free edamame starter, which is served warm, was nice. My shrimp tempura roll was real good. And the mochi ice cream was yummy. Ive never had it before and I liked it a lot.  My friend seemed to love everything he ordered. The volcano roll looked fantastic. The place is quite small but quaint. I liked it actually.

Despite the fact that AYCE sushi here in Las Vegas are a dime a dozen, the quality and flavor of Sushi Freak stood out to me the most. They have your typical rolls with the same typical names, but then they also have their own unique style of rolls which give a refreshing change. Furthermore, they also have their own special dishes like the Tuna Carpaccio, I could eat that all day and everyday, definitely brought out the wow factor. The restaurant is very clean, staff is super nice, service is excellent, and theyre open till 3am. So what's not to like? Reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the 1 limit per person on some of the specialty items. Personally for me an AYCE sushi should offer EVERYTHING as AYCE whether I want to have 50 mochi ice creams or 100 pieces of that fish. However, this sushi place is absolutely still worth going to, whether you get that sushi itch for lunch, or at midnight. I'm a fan, and i'll be going back regularly.",

The food came out relatively fast, but then again we were the only ones in the restaurant. I always order spicy scallop hand roll, albacore nigiri, and yellowtail nigiri. It's the best spicy scallop hand roll I so far have had in Vegas. It is made of 100% scallops and not of the fillers that other restaurants in town do. I ordered so many rolls that I really can't remember what I ordered. They were all good. Fresh awesome fish. The last dish was a tempura ice cream. Strawberry ice cream isn't my thing but that tempura ice cream was amazing. My only complaint is that I thought it was weird how the tempura was decorated with colored goldfishes (you know, the cheddar little crackers with the commercial that goes \"I love fishes cuz they're so delicious. Gotta go fishin\"). Nothing horrible or anything. I just scooted the fishes off to the side and devoured the fried frozen goodness.  We also shared a large bottle of yuzu sake. This sake is for those who love flavored sake and dislike that alcohol burn.  I will definitely come back for some more spicy scallop hand roll and other sushi.",

The only reason I gave it three stars was because of the service. The restaurant is not at all large and seem to be well staffed. Everyone in my party got the AYCE and throughout the night several dishes seem to have gone missing and never reached our table. It was totally understandable considering it was a party of 8 but still kind of interesting as the restaurant was not at all busy when we were there. The part that really made the overall experience just ok was the fact that it took them 30 minutes to figure out our checks. We asked for separate checks up front and granted they have auto gratuity they need to figure out for parties over 6 - it took a lot longer than it should have. Maybe it just an off night for them but I think it might be safer to try this place out with a smaller party, at a different hour, or when ordering a la carte instead of AYCE.",

When I'm getting towards the end I order a pania and a a d.a which are desert like with their sweet tempura.  Last of all I finish with a Vegas roll which is not on the menu.

The owner of the place has personally introduced himself and always made sure everything was in order. They also have the freshest fish I've encountered at a sushi joint. The service is awesome and it's small but homey so I love it. Christine is one of my favorite servers and it's a type of atmosphere where I don't mind my server talking to me and laughing with me and suggesting items. They know what I like and I almost could skip ordering and get what I want anyways. I tend to always order nigiri and maybe a roll if I'm into it. But I'm a nigiri girl at heart and I love the extra garnishing they add, if you don't like it simply ask them not to put it there.  MY FAVORITE BY FAR. I just hope their popularity doesn't go to their heads like it did with Goyemon, that would be a sad sad day for me.",

There are rolls that are both familiar and unique, and all of them were impressive. The brie and grape quesadillas were a pleasant savory and sweet surprise, and the menu options for AYCE are practically limitless! Can't wait to visit again and bring some friends to experience it, too.",

We had several yummy rolls and its the best AYCE place in Vegas. I give it 4 stars only because this time the salmon was not perfectly to my liking - a bit slimy, and every time we go just a little some thing is a bit off. Last year, the service was a bit slow. The service this time was quick and friendly.   If you're in the area and looking for good sushi or AYCE, visit this place. You won't be disappointed!",

It was uncomfortable!!! I felt like they could've went around to grab the sushi instead of consistently splitting my party in half to reach for sushi.   If you're going to go here you might as well do the all you can eat! It makes it worth it.",

I tried salmon, halibut, yellowtail, white tuna, tuna, and seared tuna. Every piece of fish was delicious! I'm usually not a fan of red tuna, but the tuna here was amazing, I ended up ordering 4 more orders just for myself.  Also, the tuna carpaccio was to die for!!  You can try any roll at this place and you won't be disappointed!    Great service.  All the servers were very friendly and actually looked like they enjoyed  working. Great atmosphere.  Tiny restaurant, perfect for date night, not good for big parties. I'm definitely coming here for AYCE again!",

We didn't mind but 20 minutes turned into 40 minutes & got seated around 9 pm. We then got seated and ordered but our food didn't arrive until 9:30. We understand that it was busy and our waiter was nice about it. We then ordered a second round of sushi and that came out one by one. We didn't see our original waiter after that and finished our food by 10:10. We looked around for our wait for the checks but didn't see him around but. Finally around 10:40 another lady asked if we were ready to check out, to which we gave our cards. I don't understand why it took 20 minutes to process our payment. The restaurant died down and wasn't busy anymore. I was absolutely dissatisfied about everything. The fact that our waiter left us and didn't inform us, the drastic wait and no one checking on us. I wanted to demand my money back but didn't want to ruin a good date night but I really hope the manager sees this.",

I wasn't in there too long but I go there more then I probably should.  All that matters is that my craving was satisfied!

Sometimes when I eat here, I still can't believe how dumb I was not to realize it.   In any case, Sushi Koma is a solid AYCE sushi option on the Westside. Parking is plentiful, but seating is not. You are a bit cramped and close to other tables. We had a table for 8 here and had to maneuver a lot to get in and out of our seats, so for larger parties I'd recommend Oyshi instead. One thing I do appreciate about Sushi Koma over other AYCE places is they have yet to mess up my order and food does come out fairly quickly. I'm never worried if they forgot to put an order in. I just tried their hand rolls for the first time last week, and I'm definitely a fan. Their sushi I would say is a bit lesser in quality and freshness than Sushi House Goyemon, but still solid. I think they inflate the prices for non-AYCE so it's always better to just go ahead and get AYCE. I wish they had a few more interesting dessert options than ice cream and mochi, but at the end, I'm always too stuffed to eat a big dessert anyway. My husband is a fan of the Big B roll - baked sushi roll topped with beef, while my favorite baked roll is the Volcano roll.",

But after the first night things started getting better as we went more often. We've become friends with the wait staff and the owner. They are such amazing people. Judy, which is our favorite waitress, has a very bubbly personality and is very sweet. The sushi chefs are working in their stations as fast as they can. Not gonna lie, I personally know one of the sushi chefs, Bryan. An old friend of mine. I'm not the type of person to brag or anything but with the many times we've been coming to this spot, the staff knows us and we get some chef specials from the owner himself. He has approached us and talk to some of the customers. When the owner and the staff found out that me and my husband got married they congratulated us and gave us a dessert of our choice on the house. Even on the receipt the wait staff wrote congrats!   I was told by my parents to treat others how you want to be treated. So therefore I have treated the people here with mad respect and I get that back from them.   It definitely doesn't take a big name or a big space for a place to be good in quality and in service. Sometimes it can be from a tiny space that has the best service and good quality.  Don't take my words for it, try it for yourself.",

I totally suggest the sashimi dinner, super fresh fair price and lots of food. The other great part is these guys stay open until 3am! I am in the industry and work crazy late hours so this is super convenient, it's hard to find good food late!",

The restaurant itself is pretty small, so if you go during dinner time, you can expect to wait awhile. But it is well worth the wait! The staff is also very friendly and helpful! I definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Sushi Koma didn't give me a k/coma, but they do serve good food in a cramp and dark setting. The table for two is on the small side; just having our menu, drinks, wasabi, and ginger made things a bit cramp. When the food came, my sister placed the menu on her lap to make room. Also, you're not assigned a single waitress, it seems like they all serve you. But that made ordering and receiving chaotic because food was served in bizarre intervals. The first thing I ordered was a house salad but it didn't come until after I made a second order. Other tables around us asked their servers where their food was or to cancel their order because they didn't want to wait anymore. However, they're quick to clear your table and toss those dirty dishes on a two-story cart behind a curtain for everyone to see and hear.    At least the food was good, except for the salad. I know, I know, ordering a ($2-$3) salad at a sushi place is like ordering a hotdog at Le Cirque (sorta), but it was just a haphazard bowl of iceberg, chopped carrots, and .5 oz of dressing (not tossed). The nigiri tasted fresh; drinks were refilled without asking; and the rolls were great and not filled with too much rice. I liked how they organized the rolls into fresh, fried, baked, and crab categories. It made ordering easier.   I'll give them points for innovation, though. Under appetizers, you can find their own version of the quesadilla, carpaccio, and tostadas -- sushi inspired, of course. It was my first visit and it was busy, so I'll give it another chance.",

    "text": "After reading reviews on Yelp, I thought I would give this AYCE a try with 8 of my friends. I was extremely disappointed. We all ordered and the first thing I ordered was a spicy tuna cut roll. Once my friends started to receive their orders (complicated speciality rolls)  I was expecting my order but it was no where to be seen. I was very patient and decided not to ask the waitress since I thought mine would be following soon.   10 minutes after my friends received their rolls, they started to order another round. I then asked the waitress about my Spicy Tuna hand cut roll and (I can't make this up) this is the response I received, \"You already ordered that and it's coming. So you want to order another one before you get your first!?\" First of all, I don't need an attitude. I was just asking why I haven't received the ONE item I ordered in the past 20 minutes! Once everyone else starts receiving their second round..I finally get my order!    The rest of my party was finishing up eating so I didn't want to order any more sushi instead I ordered Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. You would think that should only take a couple of minutes.. NOPE! Not at Sushi Koma! So after 10 minutes passed, they bring us the bill and still.. no Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. I asked the waitress and I got another smart response, \"You already put that order in with the other waitress, it's coming.\" At that point, I was furious and didn't say anything because I didn't know what horrible words would come out of my mouth.   I looked at our bill and since we had a large party, automatic gratuity was added on there. No wonder our waitress didn't care about us, she was getting a nice tip no matter what. As our party started to leave the table guess what they bring out... yup you guessed it! My Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream. I took one bite since we were already leaving.   As we were leaving the waitress finally asked us, \"How was everything?\" I said, \"Absolutely terrible. I only had two items delivered to me during my 'AYCE' dinner and every time I asked you about my orders, you gave me an attitude.\" She then tried to touch my shoulder and attempted to apologize since her manager was watching. I just walked away.   When we went to eat, it wasn't even crowded! There were 3 people at the bar and only 1 other table with 4 people on it!! I will NEVER EVER come here again! What terrible service. Maybe they can't handle the stress of serving a big party. There were also multiple waitresses!! Regardless, I don't need an attitude with my dinner. Had the waitress served us without an attitude, it would have been a different experience.  This experience is one of the reasons why I created a Yelp account. I had to share this horrific dining experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.",

    "text": "Sushi Koma is a terrible place, and you should never go there...because then it might get even busier and harder for ME to get a table.  Because this place is tiny and wonderful. I am white, and midwestern, and pretty broke, so I realize Sushi Koma is probably not \"world class sushi\" but it's probably the best a plebe like me will ever be able to enjoy and afford. So Five Stars.  SK has supplanted Goyemon as our favorite Go-To Friday Night Sushi joint, for a variety of reasons. The AYCE Koma is a great deal; $25 for dinner, and the beer is cold and comes in a frosted glass.   The sushi itself is always amazing, and comes quickly enough you don't start to lament your hunger, but slowly enough you know it's actually being made with time and care. The staff are always friendly, have good recommendations, and actually remember your whole order...even when it's completely ridiculous. (We go with a big group, and have the first half of our order down pretty pat;  \"6 salmon, 8 spicy tuna, 8 cajun albacore, 6 tuna, 8 yellowtail, 6 mackerel, 6 red snapper, 2 tiger rolls, 1 big b roll,  4 sweet shrimp (with heads), 2 tuna roe, 2 unagi, 2 brie and grape quesadillas, 4 orders of the tuna Carpaccio....we'll decide on a few more rolls after that...\")  We're all nigiri people, and generally only get a few rolls, and the nigiri here is just...over the top. So wonderful. (If you're still reading this, ask for Sam's Special midway through your dinner. Yay.) It's a great, casual sushi place. Its a neighborhood place, and now I really want sushi.   Pros; - Great food, great prices, great people, great atmosphere. - Accidental Omakase possible if you sit at the bar, late at night, and are friendly with the staff.  - Open late for that midnight sushi crave!  Cons; - This place is SMALL, and it's wonderful, so it gets crowded fast. Be prepared to wait. Have some conversation, hang out at Cafe Darak next door.  - This place is SMALL, so in order to not have every conversation overheard by everyone else, they end up playing music pretty loud. When it's at the busiest it gets shouty in there.",

When we walked unwell got sat immediately and ordered our drinks when another guy walked up to us. It took us 15 minutes to get them and it had to be from someone else since we asked someone else. At that point I was a bit irritated so I wasn't expecting much from this place but I was wrong. The sushi and rest of the staff was so good that it went from what would've been a 3 star to a 5. Only other complaint is that the \"spiciest\" roll wasn't even spicy to me.. And I hate spicy. I can't wait to come back!",

They have incredibly fresh fish, good choices, and usually a friendly staff.    The last two visits, however, have been less than stellar.  About a month ago we actually left because, in 20 minutes, no one came over to say hi or take our order (at the sushi bar!).  I generally don't make a habit of leaving once I've sat down, but I was starving and we just didn't feel very welcomed.  The last time, this week, was very busy - the after work crowd is huge for this small place!  My group of three sat at the sushi bar - however NONE of the three sushi chefs made eye contact or took our order.  They seemed to be intentionally staring down and making food, and not communicating at all with the people at the sushi bar.  Only as we were leaving did a chef come on who was friendly and asked how we were doing - everything else we ordered through the server.  Just disappointed - there are so many great AYCE sushi places with hospitable chefs and staff, and I'm not sure what happened to this place!  I'll go back eventually, but it's dropped in my standings behind some consistent favorites.",

The place is very small as many have mentioned but it was never crazy busy all the times I've went. All the sushi was really good. The baked salmon one was way too creamy for me though. Considering I was full out of my mind, that dish almost made me hurl.  The eel rolls were amaaaaazing(I am a fanatic of eel).  Seaweed salad was good. Pretty much everything was good. Tuna carpaccio was great!! Garlic tastes like chips it was crazy.  Great place for sushi!",
