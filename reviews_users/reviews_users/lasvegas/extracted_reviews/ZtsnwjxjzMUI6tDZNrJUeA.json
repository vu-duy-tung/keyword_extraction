    "text": "If I could give this place below a one I would. My boyfriend I came in to have lunch on Friday, June 10, 2016. Our server who I believe was also the bartender was very short with us to begin with. I ordered a French onion soup to start, and a chicken parm sandwich. My boyfriend ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side. The soup came out within a reasonable amount of time. We waited for over a half hour for the rest of our food. When we finally got the server/ bartender's attention and  he said that the cooks accidentally put sauce on to the chicken tenders. Knowing that my boyfriend wouldn't eat the tenders with sauce on them I expressed that to our server. The server replied to me that he had a feeling that my boyfriend wouldn't eat them like that. He sat my chicken parmesan sandwich down on the table and walked away.  He never said that he was going to refire the chicken tenders or anything. Nor did he bring us to share plate to share my sandwich. My boyfriend and I were sitting there in total confusion wondering if chicken tenders were eventually going to come out or if we were just supposed to share my sandwich.I got up to grab another servers attention and told him that we were about to leave because we were so frustrated with our service. The other server turned his back to me and said your servers over there and pointed to the bar. He literally put his back in my face. I was so offended I walked back to the table and grabbed my boyfriend told him let's get out of here. We left because we couldn't even get help to pay our bill. I have never been so belittled and pissed off at the same time. I will not be returning and I suggest no one else go there either.",

Oh wait the salad was good.  Then bring back the steak, the dried out nasty meat, but wait there's more you would think as it sat under a warmer ( they should have cooked a new one ) the baked potatoes would have actually cooked.

    "text": "Went in for drinks and to gamble. I went to the ladies room while my friend ordered drinks. He requested a \"double shot of whiskey.\"  With no further prompting or conversation the bartender delivered a double shot of Jack Daniels. When we said that was not our desired beverage, the bartender refused to take it back and insisted on charging us for the Jack as he had \"already poured it.\"  My friend then offered his credit card to pay and the bartender had the nerve to ask me if I wanted a drink. Ended up paying $12 for the drink that was wasted and leaving. I believe the bartender's name is Reese. His service was completely unacceptable. Ended up at a competitors bar and easily put at least $500 in their machines. The owners and managers of Montana Meat should wake up and realize that service brings customers back. I'd rather drive farther to not have to deal with Reese and his rude behavior. Total lack of customer satisfaction cost this bar a lot of money in the future as my friend and I both regularly frequent local bars to play and I will never step foot in this establishment again.   7/7/16 - update On the same date I posted my original review, I asked management to contact me via their website and referenced my Yelp review. I have heard NOTHING from this establishment. They missed a great opportunity to turn around a poor experience. This place is a shining example of lame customer service and taking advantage of an area that has yet to be fully developed. I'm certain that with more competition this establishment will fail once customers have better options close to home.",

The shrimp cocktail was 5 sad shrimp in a sundae glass of ketchup - no exaggeration. As for the salad, the toppings looked awesome but the lettuce was rotten and tasted terrible. I have a pretty low tolerance level for a place that knowingly serves rotten food. By the way, the dining area isn't sealed off from the bar so there is a delightful smokey stench that accompanies you and your meal :-)  The next time was a pickup order. I will always give a restaurant a second chance. Once again, the lettuce was rotten in my Cobb salad! I don't care if this is a steak place, if you have an item on your menu please serve it up to par or don't serve it at all. I'm done with Montana after this.",

I used to live in Vegas and in this same Southwest area, and have been to this place once; and food, you always remember quality food!  But last night was exceptional! Our server Cher was awesome! She gave my friend and I some really good suggestions and took her time to help us decide what to get off the menu. I love food, but my indecisiveness will frustrate me. Thanks to Cher to the rescue! She asked if we loved bacon. Who doesn't! So we got the bacon wrapped shrimp and scallops! Both were super yummy, and then we both had our own burgers; mine of course the classic big sky burger with bacon, cheese, and mushrooms. My friend and I were both happy and will definitely be back again. Thanks Cher for all of your recommendations and for being so kind and courteous because I had a really long day at work with mean management; so to come to a night cap and be around nice people is fantastic!   We'll be back for sure! Great food, and exceptional customer service!",

The last time I ordered chicken fried steak, which comes with 2 eggs and potatoes, then regular breakfast which was 2 eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes, and last the French toast, which came with potatoes and bacon or sausage. All of this for $5.95 each. The food is always ready when we get there and still hot when we get it home, and EVERYTHING is delicious. A lot of places make disgusting chicken fried steak, but here it's crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, with a light flavorful gravy. YUM!  It's my new favorite breakfast spot.   I'm not sure about the ambiance or service, since I've never eaten inside, but everyone seems nice. The bar is SUPER SUPER dark though. I've never ventured over to the restaurant side.

I got the 20 oz Montana Ribeye, the \"cowboy cut\" steak at this place. My waitress was gushing about how big it was, I told her to re-focus on the steak and stop staring at my lap. No, but seriously, she was gushing about how big it was, and I almost took her home. Ok, but seriously, she wanted it.  No, but seriously... the steak was supposed to be huge? Maybe it started as 20oz, but it definitely shrank. Fine, whatever, it was still a decent size, but it wasn't as big as the T-bone my father got.  I ordered my steak medium, it came out well done. I DO NOT like well done steak. I think if the steak came out cooked correctly, it might have been good. Since cooking a steak well done basically renders it flavorless, I was legitimately surprised when there were moments that I actually tasted delicious rib eye and not charcoal.   There were some decent beers on tap, the service was good, the ambiance was better than I expected. This place is a block or so away from my house, so I figure I'll be back. I have to write a follow up review for it. So far, though, not impressed. I wasn't expecting a five star steakhouse, but if you're selling steaks, you should at least have a chef that can time it correctly.  Oh, the raspberry chocolate cheesecake was incredible. That's why this is a 2-2.5 star rating and not a 1-2 star one :)",

He was more worried about his tip!",

    "text": "If you are looking for a low key spot in South West Las Vegas to dine, game, enjoy a cocktail, or watch your favorite team, Montana Meat is a great place to do all.  I may be partial because it is only a mile from my house, but I never have a bad experience there. No matter what time of the day I go, the food is always amazing, and very reasonably priced. For $6.99 you can enjoy a hearty size Steak and Egg breakfast, without having to drive to a casino on the strip. My personal favorite is the Cajun Filet Mignon! Anyone who has been there and tried it will more than likely agree!  Normally I sit in the bar area. The bar staff is amazing. I like that when i go in I am greeted by name and my drink is poured without me even having to ask.  That kind of service keeps me coming back.   The fact that is known as a local Steeler Bar adds another star to its rating for me, however, I think it is time to upgrade the TV's around the bar. I think a couple big flat screens would draw a bigger crowd on game days.  All in all its definately a place to check out if you live on that side of town!",

One of the onion rings was cold, very cold.  The other onion ring was crispy and warm.  The burger itself, which I am happy to report was cooked medium as requested was good.

Yeah, the place is a bar/grill with the gaming machines, but it's got a nice dining area.   The lunch was decent - very reasonable price ( strange - the menu listed the sammies at prices ranging from $7 - 10, yet the bill was $5.95 - i assume a lunch special dealio but i didn't see anything posted ) - the highlights - the turkey wrap with some delicious, spicy red peppers, the meatloaf open sammie. service can be a little slow post-meal but no biggie.   the dinner - we enjoyed the bacon wrapped scallops for an appetizer. Really loved the lamb chops. The sliders - ehhh - too much mustard on them, so i basically had mustard sliders. MAjor points for having $2 blue moon's - this is my new local pub !",

    "text": "On 8/7/18 around 6pm my family accompanied by four other families visited the restaurant. The power was out in our neighborhood so we decided to enjoy dinner out. Although I was reluctant to suggest this location based on previous experiences it was the closest restaurant with the most room. Upon arrival there was only six of us. We informed the server that the rest would be trickling in throughout the evening. The server seemed 100% irritated that he was having to wait on us. What the server didn't understand is we are a very close group of friends and we frequent many different restaurants together and we have an amazing system to make it easy on whoever waits on us. This did not matter to him. From the get go it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks. Keep in mind there was only six of us at this point. Not only did it take this long to get drinks the server  forgot drinks for 2 people at the table. When he was reminded about the drinks he stormed off taking his time to return. As we were not in any kind of hurry we just rolled with it. We then ordered a few appetizers and some more drinks. One of the members of the party asked the waiter to put the first round of drinks on his bill because he wanted to buy a round for another member who's birthday it was. This would later would turn out to be a huge nightmare. About now a few more people have shown up and we are ready to order dinner. We informed the waiter of our system. Anyone ordering will give him a name and that's who's bill you put the order under. It couldn't be any easier. Throughout the night different family members were showing up placing orders under the name of which they anticipate the order would go under. During this time it was next to impossible to get the waiters attention. He was arbitrarily ignoring or group. This is beyond unfortunate as we understand what it takes to service a group of our size. That being said we take very good care of our servers.  It is now time to settle up and this is where the real nightmare begins. We come to find out that the server has been taking orders not separating them at all. The initial drink order that I mentioned showed up with every drink ordered for the night to include appetizers and desserts. This turned what was supposed to be a nice gesture into an extreme headache as we had to figure out who drank what. Next we try to figure out the dinner orders. Another huge mess. When we try to address these situation with the server he became very defensive and blamed it on our group \"for just showing up without a reservation\" as he put it so politely. Some members had to make multiple transactions on their cards to settle up all the bills that came to the table.  If this was the first time we experienced this kind of service here I would not be writing this. As I mentioned before this was the third time we received service like this at this location. Unless management does something drastic myself and everyone that accompanied us will not be back. This is very unfortunate as we all enjoy the food and it is very close to home. I would be more than happy to meet with anyone who makes decisions in this establishment to discuss this further as this type of behaviour can ruin a business.",

Service:  We came in tonight around 9-930, normally would sit at the bar but the bar was full, which was a good sign to me! We ended up sitting in the dining room. At first our server was quick to greet us and give us menus. He quickly went down hill. After ordering our meals, we told him we were going to want cocktails but didn't know exactly what we wanted yet. We mentioned we would want wine, but had to wait for him to come back around and ask him for a wine menu.  We then had to walk up to the bar to let our server that was watching tv know our wine order and another dressing for the salad we ordered because the dressing was incorrect.  After we received our food we didn't get checked on until we were offered dessert. We also received the wrong wine. Which he did correct.  Food:  The ribeye special is a great deal, 2 riveted with veggies, potatoes and and salad.  Salads were good and fresh. Steaks were good but nothing to write home about. They were a little over cooked and lacked flavor.  Anytime the have steak sauces pre-set on the tables it's never a good sign.  Atmosphere: Cozy and nice, great for a date night. Music was a 90's playlist which was ok being that we went later in the evening. If they play that all night there would be an issue.",

It's so close to my house that we have come here for that reason alone. I think the other meals are better than the steaks.  It is connected to bar so sometimes smoke can waft over to dining area.  Customer service: pretty good since each time there has only been one waiter/waitress, 2 bus persons and a bartender for the whole place. Emily is a sweetie and she's the gem of this place.  The food: I've had 3 good meals & 3 mediocre meals. Pleasant surprises have included super great bar food, wings, and appetizers. Salads are really fresh! Soups yummy and change frequently. Kids meals are great!!! I gotta be honest that the steaks are NOT as good as they could be. Cuts are thin, fatty ribeyes, and usually overcooked. I've noticed my kids serloin had better flavor than the ribeye special. Temperature can be off on food too.  Suggestions to manager: 1) hire one more staff to help out on weekends 2) please have chef stop drenching the veggies in butter - half the amount should do 3) please note chef that kids don't usually like tons of pepper...don't put it on the kids meals including their steak, burgers, etc. It's on the table after all. 4) please throw away the dried flowers collecting layers of dust - it's grody to look at a flower arrangement made in the 90s that looks like it hasn't been dusted since the 90s while eating. 5) chef please do not use an ice cream scooper to serve mashed potatoes - cafeteria tacky!  I hope they can make a few changes to make me change my three stars to five.",

    "text": "What a beautiful gem. Would have never known about this place had it not been for my couple of friends in real life and Christopher G's review not too long ago.  Walked in on a Monday evening with no wait time. And was seated within seconds by a really nice waitress. Sadly I can't remember her name but it's a shame because she have fantastic service! She was blonde if that helps anyone :)  We asked what was recommended and she told us about their famous burgers and meats. She also told us about their promotion of buy one get one free for the burgers hell of a deal since the burgers are only $8 bucks and up.   We started with an appetizer. Spinach artichoke dip which was so creamy and cheesy. The kids loved it which is unbelievable. My kid eating veggies? Or something green? It is officially the end of the world.   Our friends got a burger and chicken buffalo strips. Around $10 each. Mine was personally $11 but came with BBQ sauce, onion rings and crispy bacon cooked medium. Delicious! Cooked to perfection and the best part was the side. It comes with onion rings or fries for next extra charge. Here's the kicker.. You can have half and half! Whoopy! Most places don't so that anymore and if they do they charge extra. I was so excited! The couple we dined with said I acted as if I won the lottery. Ha ha, meanie heads. Hey, I love my food what can I say. The onion rings tasted beer battered like the ones at yardhouse.   The children's menu is extremely affordable. I got my daughter the cheese quesadilla, which I thought came just with a drink for $3. But instead it came with a order of fries too, which I wasn't expecting. Awesome.   My husband loved his club sandwich. Which he said was huge and he could only eat half which if you know my husband is unheard of. Crazy talk I tell you. So, big portions are here as well.  Customer service was great. They were quick about giving us refills which we never had to ask for. And extra napkins because they knew we had kids   This is officially my new burger place. I can't wait to come back. Too bad it's not closer to my house!",

YOU CANT BEAT IT, even the casino quality restaurants close and leave you with their mediocre cafes.. this place is open 24/7 and I can order the chops at 4:45am.. gotta love it. I've brought over 30 different people here over the years and we always left full, satisfied.  I moved away, and still daydream about the Montana meat co.

I've been here 3 times in the last 2 months and twice you have screwed up my burger order (Each time I got Big Sky instead of Rocky Mountain) and now your bartender Brian drops the ball.  This time, I was sitting at the bar, very, very hungry, for at least 45 minutes, waiting very, very patiently for my BBQ Chicken Wrap. However, it turns out your bartender, (Brian) didn't even put my order in? Maybe if I had gambled, he would have paid attention?? Maybe it was because it was the end of his shift and he just didn't care?   I've been coming here on and off since the early 2000s and your service seems to operate in cycles. You go from good to bad, back to good and now in the second half of 2015, the ball keeps getting dropped.  It's too bad the service isn't as good as the food. The only time I get good service here is when Scott is running the bar. He's the only one that's on top of things.  I added a star, because the food is always good and another because your evening bartender took care of my meal. Unlike Brian, she seems to understand that Vegas is a service city, and that service is everything here.",

You shouldn't lie to a customer... especially if their alcohol drink of choice is always the same thing. You need to serve what you are charging your costumers for! We live right down the street and COULD be loyal customers. Unfortunately we will continue to go somewhere else!!",

There were (2) bartenders present. No greeting, not even a look up to see who was in the bar. We sat 15 minutes at a table just looking and no one ever came over! The other patrons in bar were seeking to get the bartenders' attention as well. I say if your open and will not service, then shut it down!!!!! The manager really needs to have a better handle on the night staff as they are not efficient and clearly don't have a care in the world concerning the business. This is NOT the first incident but I'm at the point that I won't even patronize again, instead I'll go to other nearbys like Luckys, Sagos or Born and Raised. Heck Ill drive to The Lakes but definitely not here again:(",

The waitress forgot our drink orders, forgot to bring out the appetizer we ordered, forgot to bring out our salads before the meal, and forgot to edit the check to take off the appetizer. Halfway through the meal the food runner practically took over serving the table. If you go here just sit at the bar. That way when they screw things up you can handle it right away.",

Also, the bacon wrapped scallops which used to be 6 for $12- have now been reduced to 4, and tack on the extra $1 for them to put the chutney and cole slaw in a container. I'm just sick of being nickel and dimed when I'm already paying $30 for a steak but an extra $0.75 for onion rings? This place  has left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively...",

So we got a chance to finally make it and so we came in sat down ordered our food within 10 mins. The waitress brought us our app( mozz sticks) and my daughter kids ribs. But than completely forgot about my husband and my meal. After 25 mins of waiting and watching her go back and forth to the other tables we asked her what happen to our meal. She of course blamed it on the supposedly big party in the back, but when we looked backed there , there was no table and that's because they already left 10 mins ago. We were the only table left in the entire restaurant. Anyways they finally brought the food out now 45 mins sitting and waiting. The waitress did apologize but didn't seem sincere. She decided she would take off our drinks to help make us feel better but what's a drink cost nothing really. I felt that she should have taken care of at least one of the dishes off. Considering how long it took. The food was lack luster I had the steak salad and it didn't wow me and his pastrami burger was decent but his mood wasn't making it taste any better. But at the end of the experience. Not too sure we would come back.",

It really did look very small and it was also kind of dry. Here's a pic of it next to my car key: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FDTBGYRXl28VbAiQECnyiHw%2Fl.jpg&s=64121b202906e0e326b7d3b4ca2ed130141f987280e03ab62cce19addf39d275\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>. I always enjoy their potatos and eggs though; Can't go wrong with those. I was just pretty disappointed this time around because of the slow service and tiny piece of meat on my plate.",

I'm placing this review onto my best seafood list as they have some of the best Shrimp add on options I';ve ever seen. They are huge Jumbo Shrimp; deveined and butter flyed open and I'm not sure what they season them with but I could make an entire meal out of just the shrimp alone.   The tables are a little small for all the plates they bring out for your meals but if you are even the slightest bit hungry you will have no problem emptying the current plate before the next one comes out.",

They have the best after hours $5 menu with delicious seafood, and burgers, including unique pancakes like their coconut macadamia pancakes! The service is exceptional, although not all the bartenders are very social to me. and I have been coming there for almost 5 years now and I couldn't tell you any of their names, nor they could me. As a neighborhood bar, it's imperative you find out your regulars names or at least where they work to show you care even if you don't lol. That aside I can always count on fresh salads and high grade meat!! They don't skimp on their quantity of food either which is nice! There's a reason why this place has been in business for so long!!",

    "text": "Located southwest of Las Vegas along the highway to Pahrump, this is one of two Montana Meat Company restaurants (the other is in northwest Las Vegas).   Montana Meat is co-located with a video-poker bar, and features a separate restaurant area. The kitchen is open 24H, the restaurant area closes at 10 PM on weekdays. The restaurant area is nonsmoking, it's not sealed off from the bar area, this is a showstopper for us at some restaurant/VP bar combos but smoke wasn't a problem the two times we've eaten here.  At most restaurant/VP bars in Vegas you'd never consider actually eating the food, but, Montana Meat features memorable steaks, and it has a robust selection of salads, non-steak entrees (e.g. lobster tails, lamb chops) as well as sandwiches and other breakfast and lunch items. We had the thick 20 oz Montana ribeye ($26) which comes with a choice of potato, broccoli, and soup or salad.   Full bar. Credit cards.",

Whenever I go, I always order the calamari (melts in your mouth like butter), turkey wrap without onions (a lil zing with some goodness) or the reuben!

I'm not concerned with the $6, I paid it...my mistake for just giving my card without reviewing the check first.  Just poor business practice.  Too bad since the food is actually pretty good.

Before you profess on how it's hard to get those type of finger foods wrong, let me stop you.  I'm a finger food fiend and not all chicken fingers were created equal. Montana nailed it perfectly.  The service was great and they remember when I said extra ranch to give me extra ranch. It's sad when I think about how many times I've asked for extra ranch and the server almost like some sort of weird conspiracy against me says \"Oh yeah, be right back.\" Not this time.Curse broken.  Each order came with steak fries that were also oh so good.  I love the feel and texture of steak fries and these tasted oven baked and not over salted.   Very very positive experience!",

My friend and I came in around 7 craving burgers. We decided to split a pastrami patty melt and a BBQ bacon burger, one with fries and the other with onion rings for good measure.   I sampled the BBQ bacon burger first and was not excited in the least. I commented to my friend that it tasted just like a bacon western burger only four times the price. A few seconds later our server came by to check on us and commented about how much she likes the BBQ bacon burger because it tastes like a western bacon cheeseburger. Guess I was right! I didn't care for the BBQ said very much so I stuck with the pastrami patty melt, which was decent. The fries and onion rings were a lackluster way to round out our meal.  Service was excellent and friendly, but there wasn't much else to make me want to return.",

The steamed veggies are always fantastic. Here's that dreaded BUT. On our way home yesterday afternoon 07/27/18 we stopped and off of the lunch menu I spotted pork chops. I inquired about the pork chops and was assured that they would be cooked to order. What I got were 2 consistency of cardboard pieces of meat. I know that the state mandated 165f for pork. The state is not eating them I am. To preclude this happening I would like to suggest thicker pork chop vice 2 thin ones. Boss, take a trip up to the outback and try their chops, I'll buy. I am a pork aficionado. Have even become more one since my 11 years in Kuwait. Pork is illegal there.",

The service on the other hand needs a lot of work. We waited for at least 5 mins for some one to even come around to seat us. Just us standing at the front looking around.   They seem to be under staff. Our waitress was not very personable nor attentive. We asked for a drink menu from the bar... there wasn't one apparently. They are revising it since no one ordered from it.  We asked about flavored margaritas...nope no flavor and no blender either... so on the rocks it was. We each ordered one. Minutes after the server walked away, we found an old drink menu online. I wanted to change my drink so my husband ran to the bar to catch the bartender.... and change my drink. The server came back and confronted us... like how dare we change the drink and order off an old drink menu.  Anyways, drinks were good. But waitress didn't come around often enough. My drink was gone for a good 15 mins before she came back around.   Overall food was good... maybe better luck next time with a better server.",

Typical gaming bar but the exception is Grace the bartender. She is fantastic! She can truly run a bar all on her own. Sometimes she gets busy and I see customers get ridiculous. Hello people- she is one person! She's attentiv, remembers our order every time. She's adorable, put together, funny, and personable. She really goes way out of her way to be professional at her job. One of the best bartenders I've encountered in Vegas and I know a ton of them! She handles each person with care and knows how to handle rude people. I'm usually floored bu the way she handles things sometimes. Amazing! The other bartenders are awesome too. Great personalities. She treats the people she works with and runners with such respect and is never \"too good\" to do any job. Humble awesome chick! She makes me look forward to coming every week!",

Expecting a hostess to appear, we were then told rudely by the bartender who was free to tell us this the second we entered, but chose to let us stand there for 2 minutes, that we could seat ourselves.  We then waited around 15 minutes to place our order. I had the BBQ burger, my advice is go to carls and get the western bacon. My bf chose the peppercorn burger- big mistake! It came with a patty covered in what looked like mushroom soup, with the fries receiving the same treatment, no onion ring straws, or cheese which was on the menu. He had one bite before deciding it was unedible. We wouldve loved to replace the burger with another item except our waitress/ bartender didn't return to the table till I had all ready finished my meal.  Food was ok/unedible.  Atmosphere was stale/smokey.  Service was non existent.  Server said just enough words to get our order, was rude, and treated us as if our presence annoyed her. When someones entire dinner is untouched save for one bite, common sense says maybe something was wrong. Server said nothing and whisked the full plate away.  I've had horrible service in the past, and have never stiffed anyone. But as the saying goes, there's a first time for everything, and Montana meat co was my first.  And as for their endless fries, maybe if you went in the kitchen and cooked them yourself, we were never asked.  Rating is zero stars, but I had to choose at least one to save this review.",

This is a tremendous value and well worth it.  There's always a few people at the bar at any hour. Not hungry, feel free to have a drink.

    "text": "To start off with I really like the owners of these places. They ran the Tillerman many years ago and left to get started with one of the oldies but goodies \"shucks tavern\". It always had great food a drinks.   Fast fwd to today. My wife and kids went in to try this place again because it's right neat our house. It was busy and in fact one of the owners was busing tables to keep up. The $34 special was terrific and plenty of food for two I might add although service was still lacking. We sat for 10 min waiting to order after we got our initial drinks. Too long.   I was very unhappy about the amount of smoke smell in the restaurant area too. Wow that needs to change.   I gave it 3 stars because the value of their food. The place smells bad and the service the last 3 times was mediocre at best but hey I will get over it for the convenience and quality of food.",

Unfortunately the menu was confusing in that in the meat section, which states \"fresh vegetables\" included, had a \"signature\" meal for which \"fresh vegetables\" meant sauteed mushrooms and onions, umm what is \"fresh\" about that and why does this one menu item in the middle differ?  When the manager named Scott come to table he explained they were fresh when sauteed. He ageed to bring brocolli, but immediately issued the statement \"this time only.\" Sadly with that attitude and comment there won't be next time! He was the bartender too, so not sure of his skillset and whether it qualified him to be a manager dealing with customer service.  The menu is confusing so FIX IT! Don't take it out on the customer, get corporate to fix it.",

For 10-11 bucks, you can have 2 huge burgers and endless fries.  You can also get sandwiches and wraps in place of the burger.  They grind their meat fresh and it has that backyard burger taste.  It's just a tad bit more than eating fast food but so much better in terms of quality.  I looked at the grave yard specials and you can get lamb chops for 5 bucks...are you kidding me?  They also have cheap breakfast specials and a steak/egg special I will try.  If the food were healthy, I would replace Montana with cooking b/c it is so dirt cheap.  They don't make money off me because I don't drink nor do I gamble but i hope others continue to b/c on the food side, this place isn't making much money.  I hope their burger special stays for good.",

From the time we were greeted to having our orders taken it literally felt like joy and happiness were being sucked out of the room by Cherlyn. The fries are great, the burgers... ehh. From the first bite of their sliders my teenage girls said that the beef had a weird taste like one that would end up making them sick. My husband and I both tasted them and agreed that they had a weird taste. By the time we got the servers attention and explained how we felt. All she said was \"okay, I'll see if I can take it off the bill\" when she came back she took the two plates saying that she had to show them to her manager, which we thought was weird. We figured that maybe she would offer to fix it when she came back but instead when passing by us 10 minutes later casually stated  that the manager gave her the okay to take the the charges off the bill... really?? With still no attempt to rectify the situation by means of giving us an opportunity to order something different, the \"server\" over charged our card. When we asked why, she stated that it was for one of the condiments we requested, which normally I wouldn't mind paying for but considering that the condiment couldn't be utilized due to the 2 inedible dishes, we thought it was a little absurd and poor business practice. We will not be revisiting this joke of an establishment.",

So you push that aside thinking your steak will be good enough to bare the smell.  Nope, ordered a medium rare, still tough as nails.  I ordered ONE drink, the same exact drink I ordered at Tex Mex down the street, a smaller portion for literally double the price.  Tex Mex $5.00, this place $10.00 for a vodka and seven up in a smaller glass.  Then, I asked for a side of ranch, charged me for it.  This place is ridiculous.  What are you? Gorden Ramsy Steakhouse?  Get out of here, your food sucks so don't charge me extra for ranch to try and get the leather tasteless steak out of my mouth.",

Solid value for a delicious steak dinner for two off the Las Vegas strip.  Great service.  Warm and friendly atmosphere.  Clean restaurant.  You will see a lot of locals here (and locals know best).

    "text": "I like this place for two very good reasons: it's extremely close to my house (I could literally walk here...it'd take me a bit, but I could) and reasonable prices. Would I come as often if I didn't live as close? Most likely not, but since I have no plans on moving any time soon, this is my go-to spot for decent eats at decent prices. Not to mention the fact that I could eat here every hour of the day.  The steak is delicious. That's probably what you should eat when you come here; don't stray. I've also enjoyed their Bolognese Pasta (the noodles were overdone, but sometimes I love that delicious, mushy, homecooked feel to pasta), Jalapeno Burger, Southwestern Chicken Salad, and Grilled Salmon. I also enjoy steak fries and that's what they serve! I don't care for their Bread Pudding or Calamari (I used to, but it's kinda meh now) though.  The only downside for me is the cigarette smoke, but that's what you get when you're in a bar. It's not as bad in the dining area, but of course, they close that part during the later hours, so you eat at the bar. It's still better than the fast food options in the area.",

Ordered the Rocky Mountain burger - a fresh bun puled high with perfectly grilled beef as I ordered it, bbq sauce, bacon, cheese, onion rings and a side of their steak fries. It was delicious! The person I was with had the Regular burger Kobe style same as I have reviewed before. Once again a hit! Fresh lettuce tomato red onion mushrooms bacon cheese with a nice perfect patty and bun. The same fries.   The real kicker was - we had only ordered one drink at the time (I only wanted water) and the waitress notified us that if we have one more drink the burgers are BUY ONE GET ONE FREE! So of course I ordered a coffee and we were set! We both ate for around 20 dollars including tip! Saved over 10 dollars!   Either way the burgers are worth the price. All their food I have had is. I will continue to go back :) but this burger deal makes it another hit in my books... Totally worth it! After all - who doesn't love great food and good deals?   :-) try it!

The Range (chicken fried steak) is amazing for the price that you're paying (six bucks I believe) and the shrimp cocktail is surprisingly tasty as well. I'm always ordering to pick up and every time I'm there- It seems as if other people are doing that too.  Customer service can be on the slower and spotty side but it's understandable when there's only one person running the game after midnight. The only thing they could change is how bright it is inside. Other than that, I'll be back. Especially when it's close to home.",

She would say something like 'oh I'll go check on your food' and then go to a table with her friends at it and chat for 5+ minutes... Thanks for checking? She would tell us she was getting more napkins and then wouldn't come back for close to 10 minutes. Horrible service not a single smile or tiny bit of personality in this girl!   On to the disappointment of food. She asked me how I like it cooked and I said pink in the center. She said that's medium so that is what I ordered. My steak, while tender and semi-juicy, was very dark and brown. Not medium. The fries were soggy and flavorless. The steak tasted like beef jerky. Way too much artificial flavoring and way too much Worcestershire sauce!    The other food we ordered was mediocre and pretty blah. I will not be coming back here. Nothing positive to write about.",

    "text": "My girls were hungry after the movies tonight so we decided to give Montana Meat Company a try. This experience was doomed from the start. Let me say before I get into the details that when I get a Millenial server, I always hold my breath and pray for the best. We were seated by a girl who looked to be in high school and did not greet us or even smile when we walked in. She was on her cell phone behind the podium that she was standing behind, so my impression is that we were keeping her from the latest Facebook post or possibly a snap chat that just came in. She led us to the table and then backtracked around us to get back to her important cell phone business that we distracted her from.       We weren't greeted (because that would have required an introduction and a smile), but rather approached by our server Cherlyn. The only reason I know her name is that I looked on the receipt when the bill came. She took my girlfriends drink order and asked my 3 year old what she wanted to drink. When she came back with the drinks they were in very large plastic cups. As she was sitting the drinks down the lightbulb came on in her head and she asked if we wanted a kids cup for my daughter. Well of course, the cup is bigger than my kid was my response. We finally got the right cup and we began to order. We got the chicken fingers for our daughter from the kids menu and we asked what options she had for sides. Steak Fries was her response. What about a veggie I asked? It's whatever they have she said. Ok, I'm getting annoyed now. I finally got an answer that consisted of some mixed information. It's either green beans or Broccoli for a green vegetable, but it depends on what they have was the response. I explained that my daughter doesn't eat green beans so if you don't have broccoli then bring some fruit instead. Cherlyn seemed a little annoyed by this request and immediately began to take our order. I ordered the 10 oz Filet medium with a baked potato and my girlfriend got a burger and steak fries.       A food runner brought my daughters food out first and right on cue it came out with green beans. We explained that we ordered either broccoli or fruit, so we scraped the green beans off and he brought back some fruit. A minute later Cherlyn walked by and asked how the food was so far. We began to tell her the mistake, but I don't think she heard us because she never fully stopped and began waiting on the booth behind us.       My steak came a few minutes later and I knew I was in trouble. The Filet was a thick cut and I had ordered it medium. When I cut into it, the inside was very rare and mostly cold. What a shame. I payed market price ($30.00) for a cold piece of meat. The server should have offered to butterfly cut the filet when I ordered it medium. Any decent server at a steak house knows about the meats that they serve and if the Filet is cut thick it is very hard to cook it medium or well without burning it, which is why I opt for the butterfly cut in those situations. Another surprise was in store for me when I found green beans on my plate. I had no idea a vegetable was offered for my dinner, or I would have chose something else. Amanda's burger was ok, and we payed the bill and got out of there.        This was a miserable experience and we won't be back to get burned again. What a shame, because this steakhouse is in our neighborhood and we really wanted it to be good.",

I recommend the Big Sky Burger- after 11pm it's only like $7 with fries. Love this 24 hours joint- best burger since I've had since moving to Vegas. Also a huge plus is that it doesn't smell like an ashtray. As a non-smoker I get fed up with bars that make my hair and clothes smell. I can't speak for day time but after 7pm I've never had a bad time here!",

As a non meat eater I would sometimes get bored with the menu but can always modify things to get them without meat so I'm a fan. I love that they have added fresh oysters on the half shell, crab cakes, steamed clams/mussels, and more!!!!  Their sister store, Shucks, always has great seafood so I wasn't hesitant to try it here. I actually enjoyed the oysters & linguini and clams so much last night I came back tonight to watch MNF and try some of the new items. My server/bartender, Scott, recommended the crab cakes tonight and I added a baked potato and side Cesar salad to accompany it and it turned out to be a perfect meal!  They also now have Ballast Point Sculpin on tap which is a bonus. All in all I love the new changes they have made. They were saying that they just celebrated their 10 year anniversary at this location.  Clearly the owners have been listening to their customers because the new machines, updated menu, and professionally dressed staff is a nice update to Montana Meat Co. I'll be back again more often.",

My family and I decided to indulge so we went ahead and ordered rib eye's, T bone steak with lobsters and spinach artichoke dip for our appetizers.  Everything was absolutely palatable. Our steaks were cooked perfectly the way we want it. The rib eyes came with baked potato and string beans; never mind the sides just focus on the main dish! (I'm not really big on baked potato and string beans) our meal also came with salads.  I'm so glad that we came to this place after coming to find out that our favorite sushi spot closes early on Sunday's.

    "text": "Went on Sunday 3-13-16 at about 7:30 PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on Blue Diamond and Durango.  The ambiance is casual and it does have a bar inside but it's separated from the dining area so kiddos are welcome, although we didn't get a high chair or booster seat.  Imagine a 24-hour Applebee's.    $87.28 got us a t-bone steak dinner, a filet dinner, a kids quesadilla, a side caesar salad, two soft drinks, and a lobster tail.    Both our dinners were supposed to come with bread and butter but neither ever came.  I didn't bother to ask about it.    Our server was nice enough but disappeared for long stretches and had an inappropriate amount of cleavage showing.  I am no prude, but if I can see your sternum you need to cover up a bit.    She did let me order first for my boy which I thought was very thoughtful and understanding of the impatient nature of toddlers.  His kid's quesadilla disappeared quickly and I snagged a few of his crispy steak fries and they were delicious.    The caesar salad was fair.  The romaine lettuce was crisp, and it had just the right amount of tasty dressing, croutons, and parmesan cheese.  It was a pretty big portion for $3.00 but the lettuce seemed to be the bagged variety or perhaps chopped a few days in advance because the edges of each piece were browning.    $28.95 T-bone steak was cooked well and came with a baked potato and broccoli.  Husband said the flavor was good and boy, was it big!  The $23.95 filet dinner came with the same two sides and was thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  I found myself wanting a bit of A-1 but, alas, our well-endowed server was not to be found.  The broccoli was bizarre because each of us got maybe 4-5 florets but they had huge stalks still attached.  Pretty cheap veg if you ask me.    $15.95 lobster tail was the star of the show. It was huge, cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and so sweet.  Probably one of the best lobster tails I've ever had.  It came with drawn butter and three lemons and I coulda probably ate three more.    Food was passable but for almost a hundred bucks after tip I won't be back due to the long distance from my house.  You can get better food elsewhere, cheaper, and faster.  Their most popular item is two steak dinners for under $40 and I would definitely stick with that because they come with sides and salad or soup for that price and that would be a deal.",

Especially the Peppercorn Burger and the Rocky Mtn burger.  Overall, the food is good, very reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it's more of a \"nice bar with better than average food\" than a \"Steakhouse or Meat Company\" that you might think based on the name of the restaurant.    I'm from Montana and I was expecting to have at least a Bison steak or Buffalo burger on the menu.  If they wanted to be really True to the name, there should be some elk or venison somewhere.  Maybe it's harder to have wild game on a restaurant menu in Las Vegas than I'm imagining, but either way, whenever we go there, I always have a tinge of regret that there aren't actually any \"Montana Meat's\".",

    "text": "I love Montana's for two very solid reasons.    1)  It's literally walking distance from my house. 2)  Their breakfast menu.  No, really, it's bomb.  It's cheap, delish and more importantly, they wrap it up well for carry out.  It has and will always be my go-to spot for Sunday breakfast.  At least until brunch finally becomes cool in Vegas.  Now just because it's cheap doesn't mean jack.  The old saying \"you get what you pay for\" doesn't apply here.  It's a damn bargain.    Side Note:   Owner, just because I said it's cheap doesn't mean you need to go around raising prices.  Ya heard?  Us Yelpers do have the option to go back and edit our reviews.  :-)",

Understand she is pregnant but if you cannot keep up with the clientele then you need a less busy shift. Have had other bartenders and waitresses that were pregnant and no issues, they helped all equal. Wife enjoys the chicken fingers so will definitely be coming back but will not sit at the bar or in the dining area!",

My husband and I typically get the peppercorn and the big sky burgers. With a buy one get one deal it is totally worth it. My favorite burger place in Vegas, and lucky for me we are close enough to walk if we wanted!  When not in the mood for a burger, I may do the Alfredo or possibly just a sandwich. The medallions are another favorite of mine!  The kids get Mac n cheese and chicken fingers to split. I have to say, I can't help but munch on those fingers. They are the perfect amount of crisp without having dried up chicken. Breakfast is our other meal that we frequent for. Bananas Fosters pancakes.... YUM!!!!  I'm not the biggest fan of the breakfast burrito, but everything else I've tried has been spot on!  For a quick meal around the corner, I'm so thankful we have Montana!!!!",

I have never had a Bacon wrapped Scallop that has impressed me, and that hasn't changed. These Scallops were overcooked and sitting in liquid.  The Mango Salsa was unappetizing.  The Lobster Bisque was very good. I like that it was en Croute with a dollop of Creme Fraiche. That one was a winner.  The Steak was pretty good as it should be seeing as they are a Steak house. Done to the right temperature, flavorful, and topped with a nice herb butter.",

They actually have a pretty big menu and really pride themselves on their cuts of meats. I guess the place could fall under the steakhouse category because it has a large selection of cuts but we stuck to the breakfast/late night menu.  The breakfast menu is big and cheap! So many skillet/combination plates that you can pretty much find whatever you want. The prices are pretty good - $6 - $8 for everything on their late night menu. They had pretty good specials on drinks when we went - $3 for all draft beer and $4 well drinks - can't really hate on that.",

What I still remember is that I usually order: 1. Filet mignon salads 2. Turkey wrap 3. Chicken caesar wrap  Also my co-workers always have: 1. Walnut chicken salads 2. French dip 3. Burger --- sorry! I'm not a really real burger fan, so I couldn't remember their names, but you can ask for it :)  One one one thing I need to mention: PLEASE DO NOT GO DURING 12:00-1:00PM because it's going to wait at least half hour for just order your food. Their service is kind of slow.   Oops! Do I say their slow?  Yes, they are.....  but Filet mignon salads without onion is my best dish. I'm here just for it.... worth it!

    "text": "I used to come here all the time, and it was awesome. Then they changed bartenders... Here's what happened.  Came in with a few friends around 3AM on a Friday night. We were all a little tipsy but wanted to stay close to home so we made this our choice of bar. The bartender took about 15 minutes to come over, my friend actually had to shout out \"excuse me\" to get his attention. Normally i would make an excuse for a bartender not noticing someone sit at the bar, but he had to literally buzz us in since it was after midnight.   When we ordered our drinks he then went over to the group he was chatting up prior to us \"interrupting\" him. 15 minutes later he brings us over our beers. No reason this should have taken so long. But we were gaming so my other two friends didn't really notice.  It then took us several attempts at getting another round. when we finally succeeded we decided we would go somewhere else. We had gamed a total of 280$ between the 3 of us and each had 2 drinks. We asked for our bill and when we received it we noticed not a single drink was comped. I'm not one for complaining when i don't received something comped but that is ridiculous. We paid our bill and still left a 10$ tip. My friend also asked the bartender for a pack of cigarettes but we noticed it wasn't on the bill so we figured he just didn't charge her. When we were leaving we walked out the door and out comes the shouting bartender. \"Excuse me!!! You guys didn't pay for those cigarettes.\" My friends laughed, threw him a 20$ and we left.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because I hope to return to this bar and see another bartender. But until then... this will be my review.",

    "text": "Not impressed by any means. Had a friend in town from LA and I just moved to the neighborhood so I thought we would give it a shot. Our waitress was a complete ditz. We waited 10 minutes just to have our drink orders taken. By the way, there was maybe 3 other tables seated...not busy at all.   We order our drinks, I ask for coffee and she says \"oh I don't have any fresh\" and so I replied with, \"can you make some?\" And she says \" oh ok, but it may take a while\".  How dare I ask for coffee!!! Little did I know she would be referring to the entire night. My friend orders a rock star and vodka and when she finally brings it, it's just the rock star and says \"oh I thought you were kidding\".   At this point I knew we should have left but he was exhausted after the drive in, so 30 min in, we get to put our order. He orders the rib eye and I order steak medallions.   About 50 min later, I, in that time had to stop two other waitresses for refills on drinks and also asked if our order was put in. She sends over my waitress and she says \"I'm so sorry we had a large group come in AFTER you so our kitchen is backed up\"   I can't believe this. Finally an hour and 40 min after arriving there, our food comes out. His is great, mine? Cold. Cold steak, the \"grilled\" onions were raw and cold, and the mashed potatoes were cold with luke warm gravy. It takes me another 10 min to flag down a different waitress, by this time, my friend is done with his meal, I ask to speak to the waitress and I tell her how terrible the night has been. She apologized and asked if I wanted soup instead!! Then proceeds to hand us a bill for $70 for a food plate that I didn't touch!   First and last time. I now tell everyone about that situation and I would never step a foot back in there. The food would have been better at Sizzlers! And for the service? How embarrassing for you.   Disgusted.",

Their salads are so fresh with the best homemade ranch dressing.  I have ordered the prime rib and cowboy rib eye and both have been excellent.  The homemade bread is so yummy that I can make a meal off of it alone.  The staff are so sweet and constantly checking on you.  You will not be waiting on anything because there are always enough waiters around helping out. We asked to see the manager which happened to be one of the owners and he was very sweet and told us how long all his waiters have been with him which was 4 yrs to 12 yrs. I can't wait to go back and try a few more items!!! :)",

This place is like a hidden gem for me.  I wouldn't have notice it by the name of course.  From the outside, I would have guessed they cut meat inside.    We parked it at the bar area, ordered 3 burgers with soda.  That burger came out and dang! Not bad at all.  Very decent sized and cooked as how I asked for.. Medium rare.  I stacked up the lettuce, tomatoes, and all.  First bite, very flavorful.  Not too salty on the patty.  Steak style fries? Nice.  I ended up clearing up that place quite fast.  Bartender kept my soda cup filled of course.    Their graveyard menu is limited, but I don't mind.  Makes me pick faster and usually a small menu is good.  Place is spacious and has plenty of tv's.  Music is constantly playing with lots of video poker screens around the bar.  Seems like they get lots of regulars that come in.    Overall, I would come back.. Only if my roommate drives me of course.  Place is quite out of the way for us.  You hear that? Drive me!",

I had the Filet medallions and what I got was two pulverized well done slices of beef swimming in a VERY strong wine, mushroom gravy. There was so much of it on my plate that even the asparagus was soaking in it. I don't know why they chopped up the asparagus it had some butter sauce on it and the whole dish was very heavy. I ordered a baked potato and it was HUGE but there was nothing on the inside of it like it had been scraped out and they filled it with semi-fried onions. It was the strangest meal I've ever had there. The bloody Mary I had was very good and the waitress was pleasant. Shame I paid so much for a really disappointing dinner.",

The steak special was nicely priced for what we got     Food seemed freshly prepared and the meat was cooked to order. The potatoes were a bit undercooked for my liking.   The bread was probably the best part of the meal, hot and fresh.    The service in the other hand was below average for what I would if excepted from the reviews   Slow service of the staff, it was a bit unorganized between the server, hostess and the food runner.

I ordered medium rare and when our stakes came, mine was rock hard, by time I was able to cut in the middle there was no red or even pink so my friend shared half his steak with me.  The fruit on the side was mostly cantaloupe.  The balsamic is sour, don't order it with your salad.  The steak and the rest of the food taste like the free steak or the cheap steaks you'll find at the old casinos on Fremont.  The restaurant was absolutely freezing, even the men at my table agreed.  There was a family who brought their lap dog and staff didn't care....I love dogs but they do not belong in restaurants on laps or maybe have a warning outside the door.  I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the chicken wings were delicious but expensive for the small amount you get.  They were the only thing that tastes like it was freshly made. If you want overpriced bar food, this is your place.  Next time we will just drive to the strip or even outback could taste better. Ha.  We won't be going back.

The food was decent ( not excellent) and the service was good. It had a comfy atmosphere so I decided to come back again with my son and husband for an impromptu dinner date.   This time around my experience was much different. Obviously the atmosphere didn't change and the customer service was still decent but the food was below par. My original visit I had the Pork Verde. It was flavorful and the portion size was great. This time around I had the pot roast which was a huge mistake. It was slimy and the portion size was tiny. The sides looked like they literally came from a van with no seasoning. I was highly dissatisfied and saddened by the experience.  My husband ordered his go to nachos. Again... the hips were under the salamander too long and were burnt. The cheese dried up and was gross. We won't return.",

    "text": "This is the second time I've had a horrendous experience at this restaurant. I wish there was a way to give them 0 stars, but there's sadly no way of doing that. Here's tonight's experience:  The poor girl behind the bar has no help, so you can't receive prompt service. I experienced this before, so I called ahead with my order, but still had to wait 10 minutes while my steak got cold. Not the first time this has happened. I ordered a rib eye, but received what I believe is a sirloin instead, though it could have been anything else for all I care, it was terrible. It was burnt on the outside and flavorless. I called to let them know. Then instead of just replacing, she decided to tell me that this poor excuse for a steak was fine. So I said never mind, I don't want it. So now that I'm walking out of the restaurant she asks whether I want a refund. I told her to forget it, I just didn't want to deal with them any longer. I hope they have a cute dog they don't love too much to give it to.   Never go there! Even the convenience of having them close to home isn't worth the waste of time, the poor service, the burnt steak and the annoyance.   Update: 3/10/2019  After a year and a half, hunger, lack of time to go elsewhere, and convenience have brought me here again. I've upgraded the review to 3 stars from 1. My server, Destiny, was prompt, personable and unobtrusive; she did a fine job. The food was vastly better than my last experience. If I blasted them for the previous awful experiences, it was only fair that I praise them for the current positive one. \"The bad doesn't wash out the good\" nor the good, the bad. But it does average it out. Good job today.",

It's the risk and fun that we find attractive ...and of course the  sub-par well drinks or/ cheap wine Right??....on the extremely rare occasions that I've been a winner, it has  always gone back into the machines, always...whether it's 20 40 or $100... I've never felt it worth it or fair to just walk away with an extra 20 in my pocket and a few free drinks...BUT  I sure wish I would have done that last night !!###...after starting with my normal 20 or $40 I reinvested my winnings as usual.. and over the course of 2 hours had my wine glass filled and/or topped off several times..usually without being asked because that's always been the norm here... only to find out at the end of the night I had accrued a $100 bar tab!!... adding insult to injury I then got accused of not putting enough money in to warrant the free crappie wine glass top offs ....if this is how 10 years (and literally 1000's of $$$....)of loyalty is treated/rewarded I would definitely take your hard earned money elsewhere...  As a courtesy to your future victims-Brian-...management (like every other gambling establishment in town) SHOULD be putting drink tabs in the glass in front of us ... so we both understand the running total !#!#...rather than bending us over and ....\"blindsiding\" us.",

They have a rib eye special for two that was less than $40. I can't remember exactly how much it was but definitely a great deal. It came with hefty sides and the meat was cooked perfectly. Their breakfast food was good too. Everything on the breakfast menu was less than $5. I got the chicken fried steak last time and had to take the rest home for lunch because it was a huge serving.  The atmosphere is nice. The restaurant portion of the building is nice and quiet, separated from the bar. The lighting is a little dark but perfect for a steakhouse. I haven't had any of their drinks yet but I heard they have good deals. I'll have to check it out next time.   The service is hit or miss. There were times I got quick, amazing service but there were other times I couldn't even find a server. It seemed like they only had one person there to attend to the entire dining area of the restaurant at times. I don't mind waiting a little so it wasn't a big deal. Aside from the wait, the people there are really friendly. I don't think there was ever a time I got a bad vibe from anyone there.",

No waiting to order or refills on our drinks. The food was really good. The Diablo burger was great and she got the 10oz filet which was outstanding. Instead of an appetizer, we decided to get the country chicken mac and cheese. Our server asked if we were sharing and we told her, \"yes.\" To our surprise, they served it in two bowls instead of one without us asking. Montana is a hidden gem. My girl left her to go box on the table. One of the staff ran out to the parking lot to give it to her. I highly recommend this place. Great food, great service, excellent staff.",

This place typically isn't my first choice but besides fast food there isn't a whole lot around and didn't feel like driving down Blue Diamond. Went in with low expectations as I didn't get the best service my last visit about a year ago. Was very smoking inside which was not friendly to my asthma. Servers name was Cherlyn (sp?) and I was helped right away. We ordered a 10oz and 7oz filet as well as calamari and drinks. The calamari lacked flavor and was very skimpy especially for the price. The filets were much better. The server helped us with all our questions and concerns and seemed to be running the show herself and I felt bad about keeping her so busy. Long story short... A better visit this time but due to the outstanding service rather than food. The smoke needs to be handled and options other than steak need to be reevaluated.",

We lived in the meth- head capital of the world previously and could still walk to a super fun sports bar with outstanding food and customer service, and not pay much money, but were happy to return regularly. We got to the Durango Montana Meat place at around 5:15pm on a Friday. There were stragglers in the bar and only a few booths of diners were filled. We were greeted and our server stopped by to see if we would be ready to order. Lackadaisical at best. You know the drill- end of shift, out of personality, Sorry folks. We were struck by her indifference. We ordered and received our meals which were a steak sandwich and some fish and chips. Onion rings were flown out from Hampton Beach NH 1968 and heated up, it seemed. My husband had students who were fresher when he was a teacher. Steak was tender but those oversalted canned mushrooms in gravy were disdainful to the customer. Fries are ok but they obviously sat on the kitchen counter while Unbusy Server waltzed around trying to look productive. Fish was fair. I had really thought this place would be alive and worthwhile. I rarely leave a place so daunted. We gauged that the quality of dessert may not be high either and left to go to Art Square and First Friday where there may be a hot sweet snack to soothe our despondency. WTH Montana Meat? One of my stars is for the Worcestershire on the table and one is for the sports we can watch here. My husband found the right word for the current state of affairs here: the food was pedestrian. Usually I can find something even in a humble cafe and it's called customer care. None to be found here, sad to say.",

The food is outstanding - Mark's service is beyond good, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get.  I have had maybe 12 different entrees on the menu and have not been disappointed with a single one.  Highly recommend!",

Kitchen was slow so restuarant side was closed but the bartender said it was ok to order food from the bar but my niece was under age so the bartender let us set on the restuarant side. Yay!!  Food: excellent, I had shrimp alfrado and side order steak. It's $4 for 4 small pieces but I still love the flavor and how tender the meat is.  Service: excellent considering she was managing the bar and had only one helper I would surely come back and bring family and friends.",

The dining room was far larger than I was anticipating. Our waitress Kristy, was very friendly and took our order very fast. Even though it was fairly busy, you could still have a nice conversation inside.   The burgers we ordered came out and I noticed the buns looks like they were baked in house. The meat was seasoned well and cooked beautifully. Nice and juicy. The fries were lackluster, but were definitely edible. I had the poblano burger. It was flavorful, but not hot. Delicious!  With the burgers being this good, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the ribeye!",

It was a pretty standard french toast, but what impressed me on how cheap it was (I could just be jaded by bay area pricing tho). The second time, I ate here with my family. There was about 10 of us, and they were able to seat us right away. The server was also really attentive to us as well. I appreciate how quick service was and how affordable this place can be for large groups. Portions here are also really big too. Highly recommend eating here for brunch :)",

The server was very casual & took his sweet time coming back to us for ordering & giving us our check. My baby had the Mac and cheese which was ok. I was going to order dessert but was so turned off from the service & food. There are so many restaurants that compete with each other.

The server was bad. He didn't ask us what we wanted, just said \"hi\" and stared at us. Pretty much the way he was the rest of our stay. He looked like he didn't want to be there. Me either. The alcoholic drinks were horrible so I settled for a Cabernet, figured they couldn't mess that up. Chips and salsa were good. The fish and chips could have been good but they were cooked in old grease. They need to change the oil out.  You can tell by the burnt look and the taste. Phili cheesesteak was the \"worst\" my boyfriend .ever had. When the waiter took our food, he could see I barely touched mine and declined a box. All signs point to, I hated this food. But he didn't ask (he didn't care), he just took my food. Literally, the worst way to spend $52 we have ever experienced. We wondered if we were being too harsh, I mean can everything be bad? Yes. Except the chips and and salsa.   EDIT: I specifically indicated \"recent\" reviews as the ones that pop up o",

Ordered a decent list of food; calamari, wings (10 pc), and the New Mile High burger. The calamari was delicious, it came with two different sauces (marinera and a chipotle sauce). Ordered the 10 pc wings and the waitress let us try two flavors (sweet sriracha and chipotle BBQ). The wings were cooked to perfection and were definitely jumbo size. Now on to the burger, I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The meat was juicy and the burger was full of flavor. The secret \"mile high\" sauce they include is delicious and I highly recommend you use it to dip the burger. They mention it's a full one pound patty, but it's two half pound patties, but either way, it's a huge burger so if you order it, make sure you come hungry. Highly recommended as it was good until the last bite!",

Bacon was fatty and soggy. And the cheese was like 3/4 inch of soggy Velvetta tasting cheese. I took a few bites and stuck to my steak fries. Service was decent the waiter left our salad and app plates along with 2 bread boards on the table so it got pretty crowded and after a few trips back and him not taking them we finally asked if he could clear them.

We love the bread they serve while we're waiting for our orders that sometimes we enjoy the bread more than our own appetizers. The staff is very friendly. If you're in the dining area, you can't smell the cigarette smoke coming from the bar area. The only downside is the limited and very narrow parking spaces. It's so hard to maneuver around.",

My bf and I have never met a menu item we didn't like.   Most recently we had the country Mac n cheese and the tuna salad. I was pretty po'd when the bf wanted to come here instead of having the sushi I was so badly craving. I mean, the tuna salad sure wasn't the sushi roll I was craving, but it was pretty yummy and satisfied me at the moment.   Looking through the reviews I'm pretty surprised to see negative comments on the waitress, Cherlyn. We have been served by her a few times and she's always been pleasant and attentive. Even when my boyfriend was adamant about no onions in his food and it came out with it anyway, she kindly took it back and had it fixed with no onions. My boyfriend always knows how to ruin a meal by fussing with the ingredients.   I'll be back here time and time again in the future I'm sure. Great local spot for some good grub.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this place now for a few months because it is open 24/7 and is right down the street from my house.  I also order take out at this place at least once a week if not more and have noticed some things that have finally made me choose not to come back to this place anymore.  First of I would like to say that the prices at this place are great, very hard to beat, quality of the food is okay to good.  Some items are a great deal at a great price, that is what kept me coming back to this place.    Now since i've been ordering take out for the past few months I've realized that they ALWAYS mess up on something in the order.  For this whole time it's been something very small (no onion rings instead of regular fries, missing bacon in a burger, no guacamole, etc.  Now this has more often then not but in my head was not such a big deal that it would change my opinions about this place. Also during my experience here I've never been charged a \"togo charge', this past order their was a \"togo charge\" and when I asked why that was there and that i've never been charged that before he arrogantly said \"we always charge togo charge\" bs. buddy, this was my first time. Okay that's no big deal though, let's get on to it.  Just recently my girlfriend ordered a salad for take out.  When she came back home to eat it there was just the salad, no dressing.  This was obviously something that needed to be brought to their attention so we called them and had to drive all the way back so that they could give us salad dressing.  Once the second trip to this place just for one order was done, we get home again and crack open the salad.  Once the salad is \"tossed' with the dressing we just got, we realize that the salad was iceberg lettuce when it clearly says on the menu that it is a mixed green salad.  Also it was supposed to have other items in it as well (blue and red tortilla chips etc) and those were not present either.  They basically made it completely wrong and tried to pass it off to us. This is absolutely unacceptable and i'm not willing to pay for something i don't want.  We placed another phone call to the restaurant this time to talk to a manager since all the other employees seem to have the heads up their asses and I wanted a resolution to fix a \"simple salad' that they somehow miraculously ruined.  The manager that answered the phone was Bryan, he seemed nice on the phone and when explained the situation he said it was okay and to come by either tomorrow or the next day to get a refund.    Upon going to Montana to pick up my refund we were met by another manager Scott, this guy was not on the same page as the first manager and was actually extremely rude and completely unprofessional.  Upon giving us the refund he had the nerve to say, \"How I do business is to have the customer bring back the togo order to fix it\" (which we already did) ,\"and he also threw in that it is the customer's responsibility to make sure that their order is correct when they pick up their order. \"Excuse me? Don't you manage a restaurant? That's not how it works, you don't say a customer is wrong, fuck you man, just getting fired up thinking about this ass and how he is somehow a manager.  Oh and by the way when he came to give us the refund, he threw it on the table and walked away!!  How mature, as long as this guy is working there, they will never have my business again.  Scott if you're reading this, get a new job, this one's not for you. Get a job where you don't have to deal with people because you've got bad attitude and shouldn't be dealing with customers.",

We never heard about the specials, I had to get up from the table and look myself. After we ordered everything came out lightning fast. App, salad and entree so quick I thought they wanted us gone. The appetizer was spinach/artichoke dip. Mayonnaise with some spinach and artichoke put in then heated. Horrible! The salad was just a salad. Nothing to write about. I had the macadamia crusted  halibut. It was nothing special. My husband ordered a steak medium rare, it came out almost raw. Our son had sliders. They were so dry I'm guessing they were cooked earlier and then reheated. The overall experience was completely disappointing. If it was reasonably priced I might not have even bothered to post a review and just never went back. But for $68 dollars, even for 3 people, I expect a little more. We will never go back.",

When we first walked in it took a good 5 minutes to get greeted...but as soon as our \"soon to be busser\" saw we were waiting, he came up to us...greeted us, and seated us right away.  We had automatically realized that the restaurant was short staffed...we work in the hospitality industry...so for that fact, we were very understanding. The appetizer, the blackened tuna, served rare, was delicious..and the price was shockingly reasonable for a 6 oz. piece of tuna.   After that we had a 10oz. filet, split, that was ordered med rare.  It had come out rare to our disappointment and we had asked to put it back on the grill for another minute or two to get it up to med rare....but we were also thinking that the rest of our meal would be cold by the time we called the server, sent it back, and have it come out again.  To our surprise, the server, AND the busser were completely nice, quick, and understanding.... they fixed the problem right away.  We got our steak back to perfect temperature, with new sides that we ordered fresh and hot.  Even the house red wine, was good..considering it was house wine.  I think it might have has something to do with the fact that they weren't cheap when ordering wine glasses because they were hand made and had no lip on the rim like a machine would do...I know.....  too analytical.   But it is what it is.  Overall, good quality steak, friendly service, with an amazingly reasonable price.  Would go there again with no questions asked.  mmmmmm....steak.",

Every soup I've tried (clam chowder and tomato garlic) has been delicious...every steak served has been seasoned and cooked to my liking.  Calimari we had the other night was tasty and the dipping sauces that accompanied were even tastier.  I love this place- especially the fact that I can go and always find a table.  Don't dress up because its simply not required but- go hungry bc you won't leave that way.",

All of their breakfast items, excluding their steak & eggs are only $4.95, and the steak & eggs priced at $6.95. Also, they are having a special right now with 2 for 1 burgers.   I've driven by the place plenty of times, always intrigued by their cheap promotions. It wasn't until a month or so ago that I finally went in. Mainly because it's the closest 24 hour dining establishment to where I spend most of my nights.   Overall, it seems like a pretty decent place to chill and have a drink with your friends. The breakfast food was good for the prices, but don't know if I would necessarily eat any of their other items.   Service was kind of bad. But when my friends and I went, there was only one person working in the front of the house and he was busy with the people sitting at the bar. Also, the food took awhile to come out. It wasn't anything too bad, maybe I just have to go when there are more people working.",

I looked around and there was no one anywhere else except for two other guys across the bar.  There was only a loud hacking cough coming from the dining room area.  Non stop disgusting cough.  The place smelled like smoke.  Not just your normal Vegas bar smoke smell, it smelled like they were using a few hundred pound of Marlboros to cure a frigging ham.  Pretty thick vomit smell too.

We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.  After taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.  After a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.  Mom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.  Overall, it  was an ok lunch.  Will I return?  Yes, but not for the Gravy Burger.",

I've been here on numerous occasions over the years since I live no less than a four minute drive away and there's always months sprawling between visits because when I eat here I never find myself eager to return.   Burger is fine.  Fries are fine.  Fish & Chips are fine but not worth $13, more like $8. Maybe $10 if they hadn't forgotten to include cole slaw as advertised, which I discovered upon reaching home with my order.  Desserts are okay. I came with a friend on one occasion after eating elsewhere to sample their desserts and we ordered about three to four items to taste a variety. Most of it was overly cloying, or tasted like it had come out of a box if that makes sense. (Like the brownie for the brownie sundae tasted like a microwaved Little Debbie bar? It was okay but there was that underlying almost plastic taste to it.)  Anyhow. Three stars. An okay rating for an okay place.",

My husband and I live extremely close to the Montana Meat Company and decided to give it a try.  Every time we passed by there were always a ton of cars here and after reading all the 4 star reviews, it couldn't hurt, right?  WRONG!    We decided to do an early valentines day dinner here, so we went the night before so it wouldn't be too busy.  You would think we would have received excellent service but we sure didn't.  But let's start with the food.    I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, but wait, where were the artichokes?   There must have been 3 pieces in the entire dip.  Ok, maybe 4.  And I promise I am not over exaggerating.  The salads came out next, unfortunately it looked like the lettuce was browning and they tried to cover it up with way too much dressing.  And finally, the steak.  My husband ordered his steak medium rare, which he has been doing for years whenever he has a steak.  This steak wasn't even rare, it was RAW.  Now my husband eats almost everything and he never hesitates to eat a rare-medium rare steak, but after he cut into it, he stopped and stared at me.    We had to send it back and when the server brought it back rudely told my husband he should cut into it to make sure he was satisfied and stood there and watched him.  The service?   two thumbs down.   Service was sooooo slow and it seemed like a rather slow night.    Terrible experience.  I don't know how they're still in business.",

Now, the strange thing about this place is to be called the meat co., you would think there would be many meat choices on the lunch menu.  Besides a roast beef sandwich and some medallions, everything else was chicken or fish. LOL!   I chose the Mac and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken, because of the suggestions on here...glad I did.  ****warning: there are strips of red onion in this, even though the menu made no mention of it.*** Anyway, after they re-cooked it without onions, and spit in it, I truly really enjoyed it. You could definitely taste the buffalo sauce, so it had a nice spicy flavor to the creamy cheese sauce. Nice chunks of chicken topped it off to yummy goodness. It was a nice sized potion, and comes with garlic bread (although mine didn't and I had to remind them to bring it).   I only wish had room for the calamari, because of the reviews on here...oh well, next time.",

It's so difficult to locate a spot that has both of these things and does them well.  Their chicken fingers are large, juicy pieces of meat that never have gristle or other bits to them, just high-quality white meat. Well sauced in a reasonable variety, they're quite good. Steak fries are steak fries, and that's half the battle!  Four stars because I've had a wrap here before that was not good, and last time they forgot the ranch with my to-go order. What are chicken fingers without ranch?!",

Made the experience fun, while also giving us the best service, drinks were refilled without asking, etc. Today we went back in because a friend in our group left his credit card, and sure enough it was held in the safe. Reliable, great service and honest people. That's all you can ask for!",

I ordered the Macadamia crusted Halibut, and took like 3 bites and I couldn't eat anymore.  I didn't read the description close enough it had a lot of dijon mustard on it and it was very overpowering.  Our waiter came around and asked if I needed a box, and I just simply said, no thank you I didn't like it.  I expected to pay for it, it was my fault.  They were nice enough to remove it from the ticket.  It was my first time at Montana Meat Company, and I wasn't too sure about it.  That was super nice of them, so I will go back and try something new next time!",

We had some kind of chocolate cake dessert with ice cream. It was good. This place is a bar/gaming place. Always there are separate glass doors to get to restaurant and separate door to the bar. This place doesn't have that which is strange so there is the smell of smoke that enters restaurant. This wasn't a problem for me but for my dining companion it was. We changed tables and they seated us in the back and that worked fine. I will return. Would like to try their breakfast. The menu for breakfast looked good. Also probably will visit their bar and gaming too.",

    "text": "I live at Mountain's Edge and enjoy a good breakfast with an Irish Coffee. No doubt Montana's has a good breakfast at a very reasonable price! I used to go into the restaurant with the lady a couple years ago. At first the restaurant was quiet then families started roaming into the facility. Sort of like a migration. A short time after the \"migration\", it got loud as these folks didn't have any regard for other patrons. They typically showed on the weekend. My guess is they probably just got done with their prayers to an invisible deity at their locale worship center. Right afterwards they opted for breakfast to feed the \"commune\". Trust me, they don't give a sh*t about others (there is a Mormon worship center very close). The lady no longer wanted to go to breakfast at this location - not relaxing.  At this point, I started going alone for a bit of personal time, but alas took my meals in the bar! Life suddenly got sweet again. Okay, this is where the 5-stars are warranted. The bar is kickass! One of the first things you notice is the iconic \"leg\" lamp from a \"Christmas Story\". That alone is worth a couple stars. Still, it is only so far a \"leg\" lamp can hold up a place. What in my opinion really makes this bar shine are my two regular morning bartenders, Emely and Wes! These two are pretty contrasting in nature, but both damn good on multiple fronts.   My advice for adults is dodge the restaurant and pop into the bar. If you got Emely or Wes tending, then just settle in and relax. If you catch Mark before he leaves shift then you are gold.  For the record, the bartenders at Montana's also wait tables. If you opt to roll the dice, then you might get lucky and have a stellar waitress/waiter with a quiet meal. For myself, I am not too much of a gambler. If I bet, it is on a sure thing ;)",

The only thing with flavor was the Italian Sausage. The sauce tasted like thicker red water. The waiter never came to ask how things were but to give us our bill.

Food was served in a timely manner and portions were very generous. The waiter/bartender Wes; was so awesome! We all joked with him about his \"multi-tasking\" skills. He even took the time to check on us (several times) all while going back and forth from the bar, greeting/seating guests and serving.  His personality was very 'upbeat'; which made us feel comfortable. By the way... Wes even drew a special cartoon of himself on the top of the bill; riding a skate board with a top hat!

Not wanting to inch towards our bento boxes, we pulled into the Montana Meat Co for some sandwiches instead.   Montana Meat Co is both a restaurant and a bar. We walked in to the restaurant part and were eventually greeted by the busboy, but we weren't really sure what job he had. You see, we had three different waiters tending to us over the course of the meal. More on that later.   The busboy/host/waiter sat us and took our drink orders. The bartender from the bar part of the restaurant eventually took our orders: club sandwich on sourdough and pulled pork with onion rings. The food came out quickly but we never saw the bartender/waiter again as service was taken over by a waitress. At least we guess it was taken over by the waitress as she never actually told us that. She spent the rest of the time just filling our water glasses.   The club sandwich on sourdough I ordered was served to me on white bread. The club was dryer than the temperance movement during prohibition. The pulled pork sandwich was served without the onion rings.   We would have told the waitress or the bartender/waiter or the busboy/host/waiter but no one came by to check up on us. \"Service sucks,\" we said as we supped on our sad, somber sandwiches then split.   Next time we will sit through the traffic...",

My chicken nachos were just a lot of chips and my girlfriend's French dip was so dry and hard she called it \"tough\". When you take your girlfriend out to a restaurant that specializes in good meats and she describes her French dip as being \"tough\" that's embarrassing. Not only for me but for the restaurant who should have an excellent French dip.  Bottom line: service was poor and food was not great.  Also, they grouped everybody together in only one part of the restaurant so we had people sitting there facing us the whole time easily able to listen to our conversation. Lazy service considering there was plenty of additional seating to spread everyone out  I will not return",

Last time my order sat, and I sat, and it took longer than needed for us to find each other and for me to be on my way.   This time? I ordered the 20 oz ribeye. Picked it up. The steak, though thick cut, had none of the marbling associated with ribeye, was a far former cut than ribeye and appeared to be the sirloin. Took it back and rather than making me happy was told how the steak was just fine.   If I am not happy with it, it is not fine. There was no effort of any kind to make me happy, even to make sure I come back again. I cook my own ribeye and the steak I was given did not seem to be what I ordered.",

Turkey sausage/bacon would be so great for who don't/can't eat pork. Thad really all but also sometimes the door to the bar isn't closed and the smoke smell goes straight to the back of the restaurant. I know the bar is attached but the door is there! Other than that I love this place and the staff is always exceptional and the music is fun. Thank you!",

It's usually hit or miss with this place but the last few weeks it's been a miss. My husband and i went for lunch and the same waitress/ bartender was there as usual.  The place was completely empty except for one other table.  And of course they say us next to them.  We ordered our usual lunch special but this time it was completely gross and different.  I complained to the waitress and all she said was that i must be wrong it's always that way.  Ummmm nope! Normally our burgers come with 2different melted cheese a heaping amount of mushrooms and fresh fries.  Today it came with cheddar cheese and 3 mushrooms.  It was over cooked and missing toppings that always come with.  She didn't care about my complaint,  she just decided not to come back to our table.  Horrible customer service and an overall horrible experience.  Won't be going back anytime soon.  Rounders here we come.  Please be better!!",

We sent it back - when the waitress finally made it back to the table. She asked what was wrong with it, never asked if she wanted anything else. Didn't see her again until our check arrived - about ten minutes after we were ready to leave.

Judging by the reviews, it looks like Montana Meat Company gets a lot of its business by being close to home for many. Same here. Just up the street so it's closer than Outback, and cheaper too. I've had some great steaks here and fortunately they've always been cooked to perfection. Each entree comes with 2 sides so you won't leave hungry. I ordered filet medallions and DAMN they were delicious.   Desserts are amazing as well...I suggest the cookie ice cream sandwich. The dining area is nice where you don't feel like you happen to be eating steak among a cigarette convention. But if you like that route, the bar area is cozy too with lots of TV's.   This is a Steelers bar FYI so don't be parading in there with your Ravens helmet!",

This particular restaurant has its appeal, but falls short on the one thing it should be known for--the steaks.   I'm a harsh critic of steak places because I expect my meat to be cooked but it burned and tasting of blackened crust. Unfortunately, my steak tasted more like smoke and burn than anything. I ordered the ribeye and it was okay, but it wasn't seasoned. If it was, the burn taste overpowered it. The other thing that threw me off was the crust that forms on mash when it sits for a few minutes at the window. That turned me off.   I admit there is one thing that was okay, that being a lobster bisque. So, if you want to go for soup, head there. Otherwise, go somewhere else for a cut of meat.   I'll update this review in 6 months. I hope it improves with time.",

The service is probably the worst I've had aside from the fact that they get the order right at least 75% of the time. They are a bit rude, bit without meaning to be. Very impersonal and don't really speak to you. They just drop the check on the table and walk away. They take your order and just walk away as they're writing it down without saying a word. The place is dark, quiet, and boring. Put a TV on the wall? I won't be coming back after this last visit, so I'll REALLY miss the delicious food.",

There's a sign clearly posted as you walk in \"buy one get one free burgers\" ANY BURGER. We were a party of 4 and we ordered 2 specialty burgers and 2 classic burgers. After waiting for what seemed like forever for our burgers, my husband's burger was not what he ordered. Our server was not who delivered our food and only returned to drop off the check and ask if we needed change. She also notified us that there's been a change in the burger policy. The buy one get one burger only applies to \"regular\" burgers and not specialty burgers. According to the bill, she didn't even discount the burgers that WERE eligible for the discount. I suggest you take your ANY BURGER sign down since you've decided to change your promo. Also, the server could have made that disclosure when we placed our order. When a table orders 4 burgers wouldn't that be more than obvious we were after your promo?   As much as we enjoy the food there, the service has become less than desirable. I think it's time to seek other dining options.",

If you are a dessert person, prepare yourself - theirs are about 3 times the size of ours and just can't be done. When they show you what there is, you think you are looking at the whole thing, but it's a portion!   It is a drive away and a pain if you don't have a car.

With that being said, Montana Meat Company is only 1/2mile from our house and we enjoy walking... yes I said walking to this establishment (walking to a place in the SW is almost unheard of right now).  Most of the time we are there to hang out at the bar, but the dining are is very nice. A bit dark and a lot of leather. The decor is right out of a cattle ranch minus the manure smell. I like it!  Along with the good food, is a good staff. We have gotten to know some of the workers and everyone is so nice!   The bar area is cool. About 6 plasma TV's for sports and they serve one of my favorite brews... Anchor Steam!   The food is really good. I have been here MANY times and I have only had to send one thing back ever... The Steaks are obviously their trade mark and the main attraction on the menu (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.montanameatco.com%2Fmenu.htm&s=77697f99fe2af9b4413717d1d4ab0b2b843992666aefefa58fb47f1267c102f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">montanameatco.com/menu.h...</a>), and they are very good. The prices are not too bad either for a steak dinner.   We have also had a lot of their \"Bar Food\" selections, and I have no complaints. Everything is Hot and Fresh, and just like Iyrne B. said, the portions are a nice size.  I was going to give this a 3 Star review because the bar is a bit small and cramped, but I remembered it was also a STEELERS bar on game day... Can't go wrong there! Cheers.",

When I told him I got food poisoning from the chicken he acted like it was my fault for not noticing it was under cooked and eating it. He also told me I should have called sooner. When I told him I had tried calling multiple times he said it was impossible as he had been there and available every day. He was extremely rude and wouldn't even apologize. He said he would make sure the kitchen cooks the chicken thoroughly next time. I won't hold my breath.",

The meats are good. Not Monatana fresh, but still definitely above average. Portions are nice size, service is quick and friendly and atmosphere is that of a Montana log restaurant, which is pleasant.  Nice neighborhood 24 hour restaurant/bar.",

That\"s why I didn't expect to be treated the way my friend and I were treated last week by the bar tender named Grace.I come to this establishment 4-5 times a week, usually in the morning. On this particular day, friday the 22nd, my  friend and I were there for about an hour after work. We both lost about 40 bucks a piece on the machine which was not a big deal. I had a cheeseburger and my friend had a calamari and we both has 3 beers a piece., I left Grace $20 which I thought was enough to cover the food my friend and I ate. We were leaving and Grace out ruuning and yelling at my friend saying that she owes her money and had the bill that was 10 something dollars . She went after my friend like we were trying to run away from our bill. This is a bar that I go to almost every freaking day! We were already out in the parking lot and Grace is shoving this bill on my friend's face saying that the $20 bucks I gave her was not enough to cover our food!! I and my friend have been humiliated in our lives as much as that time. I gave her $20 bucks more . I learned later on that she told her manager that she had a problem with me and told the manager that we did not even play the machine. People like Grace tarnish an excellent establishment like montana. I have had a Grace experience in this establishment ever since I started coming here except for when Grace is there. So I highly recomment this bar to any friend's I have . But now I tell them not to go there on thursday, friday and sunday mornings. which are the days that Grace works.",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the 2 for 1 Burger and Fries special and after reading a few Yelp reviews that the burgers were really good, I decided to try it out with my family.  Good and Bad.   The Good - The burger was one of the best I have ever had.  Amazing flavor.  Seasoning was spot on.  The bun was terrific.  Just a flat out awesome burger experience.   The Bad - The fries were cold.  Not just my regular ones, but my wifes sweet potato fries as well.  I wish I could say this was the biggest issues but it wasn't.  The service at this establishment was absolutely horrific.  Not in a rude sense but slow like watching the grass grown for hours.  The server had zero personality.  It took a while to get him to come over.  We asked a question about the burger special which must have been what put him in a crappy mood.  \"Oh, great, more 2 for 1 people with no money.\"  Now, I was formerly in the hospitality business for over 18 years and am a serious over tipper.  I do because I served and tended bar for years and know that you live off of gratuity.  The food comes and luckily we did need anything during the meal because we never saw the server again.  We had to aggressively plead the busser to get us a Coke refill.  It took nearly 15 minutes to get the check.  I swear I almost walked out.  I probably should have.  Needless to say I did not leave a very good tip since it certainly wasnt deserved.  I should not have left any gratuity but I just cant bring myself to do that.  I know, that is just plain stupid.    I doubt that the management group of the Montana Meat Company is keeping an eye on Yelp to make sure that they are getting reviewed well so I doubt this situation will change much.  If they were reading consistantly, I doubt I would have had the experience I did.    So even though this burger was killer,,,, it is still not in the same league as BJ's bar and grill off of Valley View near the 215.",

It has great relaxed athmosphere and great prices.  I got the Kobe beef sliders, the sliders were perfectly cooked along with great crispy fries.   We also had the honey mustard chicken with the bacon, chedar cheese and mushrooms. Which was moist and came with a great baked patato.  The only negative thing I had was the waiter, but I think that can be avoided and doesn't have anything to do with the food.  Hope you enjoy this place too.",

I mean really $4.95 for a full on breakfast?... i have had almost every breakfast offering they serve and i think the chicken fried steak \"The Range\" has to be my favorite to date. Service seems to be on point when i have rolled through and i have even tried the lunch specials $5.95 for all sandwiches, wraps, and salads... i went with a turkey wrap and was tasty with the thin crunchy fries. Hard to beat such a cheap meal literally a few blocks from my house. Check it out if you have passed it on your way to/ from work back to the house as its not a bad spot at all.",
