Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because their shrimp can sometimes be mushy (but we've experienced this at all of these cajun seafood spots).   They've also became more stingy on the amount of sauce they put in the bag but overall still worth going.",

    "text": "I could literally live off of their sha-bang mixed shrimp! As a savory shrimp lover, their food is filled with satisfaction. However, ya'll ever love a restaurant so much because their food is so damn good - regardless of the long wait, forgetting or mistaking of your order, or occasional rude customer service? Whatever it maybe that didn't provide you with a smooth experience, you low key still slide in that restaurant for that good food... well yes that's me. Taste of the food execution always on point. Out of the many times I came to take out an order there were multiple errors to where I had to come back to correct it. No biggie they correct it and everyone happily moves on.   There was one situation that left a forever sour experience with me though and it was the attitude of a young woman during the time I wanted to place a take out order. I called and a guy answered, he asked me to hold on the line, got it! A couple minutes later the call hung up (any iPhone user isn't stupid when your phone says *beep beep* \"call ended.\") I wasn't upset at all, I just gladly called back and a young lady answered this time. I reintroduced myself and giggled (to make light of the awkward phone call back), and explained that \"the phones must've accidentally disconnected so I'm calling back to finish my take out order.\" The lady responds with an irritated attitude saying, \"No you just hung up on him (referring to the first guy that put me on hold) but what would you like in your order?!\" Again I explained I didn't hang up instead I was asked to be out on hold. She instantly denies that happened and told me he was ready to take my order upon calling... WHAT THE HECK?! I wasn't going to argue with her, I was giggling to make light of the situation but she wasn't having it. So I told her thank you but I will not be placing an order anymore. Most awkward and rude employee I've met in such situation. Anyways, thank the Lord whenever I call in a take out order it's a guy who answers so far and no sign of her. I still get my sha-bang fix and that matters but whoever that lady was she needs to reeelaaax. LOL",

I was excited to try the location in my hometown of Vegas, but sadly, it disappointed me.   The main reason I didn't like this particular Boiling Crab was due to the sauce. The sauce is not as flavorful, the consistency is more watery, and there usually is not enough of it. The shrimp and seafood were cooked well, but if the sauce isn't delicious then what's the point, right?  Overall, the staff was friendly and the rest of the items like the Cajun fries were decent. I probably won't be back again since there are lots of Cajun seafood joints in Vegas. I guess the next time I'll be at a Boiling Crab will be in Cali!",

    "text": "Oooh, this is it...and I'm letting you know!   After having been somewhat disappointed by one of their competitors, The Boiling Crab really stood out for me. The restaurant itself is very open with plenty of seating and while you can obviously smell the seafood, it wasn't like a punch-you-in-the-face smell you might expect. As with similar restaurants, each table is pretty basic with a disposable cover and next to nothing else. I thought it was really cool they let you write on the walls too!  With places like this, I come generally for two things only...crawfish and shrimp. I was glad to see that Boiling Crab clearly differentiates between frozen and live crawfish. There's a huge difference and for those complaining about the work to reward ratio, you just ain't doing it right! :P   I ended up ordering 1lb of each and loved every bite of it. The crawfish were perfectly cooked and I was in body cracking, head sucking heaven. Even the shrimp were cooked as close to perfect as you can get. They have a couple seasoning choices and if you can't decide what you want, they'll throw it all together for what they call the \"Whole Shaw-bang\". I opted for that on the crawfish and although I didn't taste much of the lemon pepper, it was delicious. For the shrimp, I ordered it with the \"Cajun\" seasoning, which is spectacular! Both were super flavorful and with the medium spice, it's the perfect heat level.  If you're not into shrimp or crawfish, they have several other options from oysters to lobster. My little man had some crab legs which they happily made plain for him and he devoured them. For those who don't eat seafood, about the only thing they offer is chicken wings, but the wifey ordered those and said they were pretty decent.  When it comes to the service, I had no complaints. Our waitress was great and made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. The prices are good too! And while I'm always wanting to check out new joints with crawfish, I'll definitely be back to The Boiling Crab when I want an amazing, messy meal!",

As soon as I walked in I was excited because I saw people with the bibs And I remembered seeing a friend on Facebook with a picture of them and the bib! My fiance ordered the king crab and I ordered the clams. The king crab didn't have a price on the menu but we got a pound which consisted of 3 hugeeee crab legs! I got one pound of the clams and some fries! We receive our meals at different times which I didn't mind but I quickly realized why. I got mine last and as soon as I got the clams I finished about 15 mins faster then my fiance because crab legs your need to crack and clams you just get out of the shell. I know seafood is on the expensive side and our meal definitely was. Between the both of us we spent $60 plus tip $70. I gave them only 4 stars because the clams were not worth it in my opinion. I got mostly shells which made me a little disappointed. I didn't mind because shawn shared his food with me as there were plenty meat from the crab legs. All in all it was good but I won't be getting the clams again. Next time I'll probably try the shrimp.",

    "text": "This is my second time coming here since I have moved to Vegas and I always get my usual shrimp, corn, and sausages medium spice with the whole shabang! I love this place because: 1. It's way bigger than the other two locations in Southern California. 2. As a result of it being bigger, wait times are next to minimal. 3. Service is fast and efficient. 4. Plenty of parking. 5. They have tvs just about everywhere so if there is a big game on, you will not miss it!  Tonight I also ordered the lemon pepper hot wings out of curiosity. To my pleasant suprise the wings were actually pretty good and bigger than your average wings!   I gave them 4 stars because the first time I came here I remember ordering the calamari which was about 10 dollars. It was good but for that price you get a small portion and honestly one person could scarf it down and not even think twice about it. My recommendation would be to get the hotwings instead because you will actually get more meat for the price. 5 pieces were about 6 bucks and 10 was about 3 bucks more. The two flavors they have are lemon pepper and cajun. No, you cant get both flavors if you order 10 pieces. You would have to order separate to get both flavors. Why you cant split it I dont know. The server couldnt answer my question.  The most common question I get is, \"Is it better than Hot n' Juicy?\" My answer would be \"YES!\" Both are similar but Boiling Crab has more advantages namely my 1 thru 5's above. Go eat at both and you can come up with your own conclusion, but as you can see I already gave you mine.  So if you have that seafood with spices craving, BC should satisfy!",

It's another place to hit up around lent or when you're simply craving for some good seafood (crab legs, blue crab, mussels, crawfish, lobster, shrimps, etc.).  The food is good and just like Hot n Juicy.  They have all sorts of shellfish in different sauces and spice levels.  Their spice level is a bit spicier than HnJ though. The garlic butter lobster is slightly better at HnJ.  You get a bib and rolls of paper towels.  The interior looks more inviting and kid-friendly compared to HnJ.  So, if screaming and obnoxious kids bother you, go to HnJ.  There's a shark on the ceiling, lighthouses, nets, etc.  Service is not so consistent.  These are reasons why they earned 1 star less than HnJ.",

Parking is hardly a problem and the staff are nice and quick to make suggestions and refill your unlimited soda.   *****TIP! The spicy can get pretty spicy so i would try a pound first. ******TIP #2! Corn soaked in CAJUN SPICES will taste so good but will burn so bad.  Definitely a spot to try, especially if you are not afraid to get MESSAY!",

    "text": "I called before I came and the guy who answered was definitely familiar with gluten allergy/celiac. He told me to tell the waiter to give me a plain boil as opposed to any of the spicy boils.   When I came in, I told \"Eric\" the waiter I was celiac and I wanted \"plain boil\" and asked him if they could use clean utensils and keep my food far from anything fried or with spices. He assured me that the kitchen was compartmentalized so that there's different stations for boils and all fryers are separate, etc.   After Eric took my order, he even came back and said he wasn't sure about the butter. I told him I'm okay for dairy, but he went back into the kitchen without me even asking and took a picture of the barcode and ingredients for me to double check. The butter is safe!   This place is absolutely safe for gluten allergies and celiacs! Food was wonderful! I had the Dungeness crab and the king crab legs. I definitely recommend the king crab legs. Cooked to perfection! Eric was one of the best waiters I've had in a long time in vegas!",

To me the spiciness is just right, it's not too mild or too hot. Their sausages are pretty good.  The regular fries(not the cajun fries) are also outstanding!  We always bring the left overs to our house and eat with rice the very next day.., was as good as the day before... My only complaint will be on my second visit, there were not much sauce in my bag comparing to the one that I had previously.  I think I enjoy having my 1pound of shrimps at Boiling Crab even though I will be smell like garlic all day, LOL My sister wants to take it to go, freeze it , and bring it to Korea for her husband... I asked her, \" Is that so good?\"  and she replied, \"I'm so sure that I 'll be craving for the shrimps more than missing you!!!\"",

    "text": "This boils down to a pretty simple review. If you're a fan of Hot n Juicy Crawfish, you'll be a fan of Boiling Crab. The premise is exactly the same--you order seafood in 1-pound increments, you choose a sauce type and spice level, it comes out in a plastic bag, and you go to town. The sauces are named differently, but just like HnJ, I go for the one that mixes everything together i.e. \"The Whole Sha-Bang.\"  If there's one thing BC has over HnJ, it's that the space is much more, well, spacious. You could probably fit more people in BC than both Vegas HnJ locations combined. Also, it's a minor thing, but I like the napkin dispensers at BC better than HnJ--when your digits are covered in sauce, it's much easier to grab a napkin at BC.  One weird thing about BC? They charge 25c for a cup of water.",

    "text": "Get ready for your hands to stink for days!  Boiling crab is a nicer version of Hot & Juicy (can I say that?)  The place is much roomier and feels cleaner.  Every time I go there, the service isn't all that great.  Tons of teenagers sort of just hanging out.  We never really get much attention and never have one dedicated server.  There are a couple of really great servers, but a majority... EH.  One time, I had to get up from my seat all the way in back and walk to the very front to ask for a drink.  Not that fun when your wearing a bib and your hands (and probably face) are smeared with gunk.  Anyway, the food is pretty good.  The shrimp is typically pretty large.  A pound is enough for me to share with my husband.  Love the added on corn on the cob and sausage (half pound addition is plenty!).  I did have one time where the shrimp was so overcooked it was impossible to peel is cleanly, but normally its pretty awesome.  For $9.99, I would say that the value isn't bad!  $14.99 buys you a pound of snow crab legs.  I really hate paying for snow crab legs when I know I can have as much as I want at a buffet... but one night we were really craving it.  Verdict - not worth it.  Overpriced and despite it being soaked in spices, bland.    I recommend getting the whole shebang in medium (its plenty spicy!)  Its the perfect blend of spicy garlicky goodness.  Do try the cajun fries (so worth it!).  I haven't been able to try any of their other fried stuff yet, but looking fwd to it.  Oh yeah - don't forget to bring your Sharpies to tag up the walls!",

They offered us a metal nut- cracker and, only when asked, brought utensils. These were of the flimiest 'dollar-store' plastic so they were hardly useful. It took a long, sloppy, diffi ult, time to get the meat out to eat it. My friends were not happy.  I spoke to the manager, Nate.

The dining area is 2-3 times bigger than most of these types of restaurants I've been to and the tables can  be quickly joined to seat large rows of patrons together.  Several large, flat screen TVs are viewable from anywhere you're seated.  Parking is also ample.  I've been to several Cajun Seafood-in-a-bag type restaurants and this Boiling Crab is really good, but still not as great as some of the ones in Southern California.  I am, however, pleased that we ordered different items in four bags - shrimp, crawfish, mussels, sausage, and corn and nothing was under or over cooked.  The sizes and portions of everything were to my liking and the food came out hot.  Although the sauce was spicy, it lacked the packed flavor that I've grown accustomed to.  Lastly, having such a big dining area may have caused our server to forget about us.  We had to flag her down for drink refills twice.",

I also had all three spices, medium - which was just about perfect for me (I don't eat as spicy in my younger days, but this was fine).   Definitely a fun, messy and good meal.

Half of us loved and the other half not so much.    We ordered the sha bang which is a mix of all the sauces.  We had half in no spicy and the other medium, as we can all handle a different level of spice.  For myself I have a pretty high tolerance for spice, so I really enjoyed it, even though I'm not much of a seafood person.  The sauce is just AMAZING!!!  Some of the other girls wasn't really a fan.  If you can't handle the spicy and don't like to work for your food then crawfish may not be the right thing for you.    We did also order the shrimp, clams and catfish.  The catfish was great with the side of cajun fries, it was a great alternative for the girls who didn't enjoy the crawfish.  BTW the corn is a must have!!!",

Just a wooden table with a sheet of wax paper on it, a bib on your belly, a pile of lemon wedges in the middle of the table (again, no plate) and that's it. Then they bring plastic bags of hot succulent, fresh, plump, perfect craws! Lobsters too! King Crab legs! Dungeness! Shrimp! The seasoning and spice levels can be mixed and matched. I recommend The Whole Shabang at a medium spice level. Although I've been going xxx spicy lately.   You will use your hands and you will make a mess! You will feel like a big fat dirty animal. You will feel satisfied!  Many folks add potato, sausage and corn to the bags. It's not a bad idea since the flavors mesh so wonderfully. I however do not want any precious stomach space occupied by anything other than the fresh crawfish. I definitely do not understand why someone would come here and order wings (which are actually yummy) or anything for that matter other than those beautiful bags of happiness but I suppose sometimes kids come along. Stupid kids!  The crawfish are fresh (which is rare for these parts) so I recommend them as a must- have selection. Close second goes to the King Crab legs. Eve",

    "text": "Shrimp is as good as Hot n Juicy Crawfish (HAJC), but NOT as good quality as Cravin' Cajun (CC). I did receive a generous 19 shrimp per pound ordered, though. (Yes, I lined 'em up like trophies.) The sauce is spicy, but oddly buttery/oily, and I found myself not dipping the peeled shrimps back in the sauce. That is a sad state of affairs. Both HAJC and CC have me redipping in the sauce at all costs.  The Snow Crab (14.99/lb) here was of extremely good quality, and this reason alone is what is keeping my overall rating from being 3-stars. Some of the plumpest, sweetest and biggest Snow Crab I have ever had. I guess the owners figure that if people in Vegas are paying $25 elsewhere to eat all-u-can-eat snow crab, paying 14.99/lb better get you some top-tier crab. Interesting to note that my Snow Crab order was actually 0.9lb on my lunch receipt, so they only charged me 13.00 for the crab that I received. Pretty cool.  A ton of LCD tvs in the space, BUT NONE of them were on HD channels, so we ended up leaving at our game's halftime when we probably would have hung out longer if they had HD channels. The tvs are plentiful, but all kind of small (37\" or 40\"?) And the restaurant space is big, so I found myself squinting to keep my eye on the football at times. If they had sprung for 46\" or 50\"tvs it would have made a BIG difference. A classic case of quality vs. quantity.  Service was really good. The place seems well-managed. Unfortunately the buttery/oily sauce wasn't my style. I'm sure there are people out there that love it that way. Definitely give it a try, it may be for you. For me, I'll stick to CC and HAJC for my bag of cajun seafood fix!  Sauce note - if you get just the 'ragin' cajun' sauce it comes out like a uniform mole sauce with no garlic bits. No fun. If you add the 'garlic spread' to the sauce it improves, but then it comes out buttery/oily. Maybe doing the 'whole shebang' by adding the lemon pepper cuts it some, but I didn't try it. I was full by my second order.",

It was \"spicy but good.\" Jessi also ordered the Cajun chowder after she found out that the jambalaya was called gumbo (which upset her). \"It was good!\"the girls also ordered sausage and rice. It was \"yummy\" they loved the sausage in their mouths. Also Jessi recommend corn with your shrimp. It makes it better. Angel got king crab and garlic shrimp. Both were good. Crab was too much work.

It makes me feel like I can breath fire but the girls didn't seem to mind. Must have been all that sausage... This place is the best and we all recommend it.   P.S. \"The other place has spider crab so maybe go there instead\"",

    "text": "Yuuuuums! Sometimes you got to get a little dirty ;) You can't really go wrong with anything at BC. The food is bomb. The customer service is beyond par. The cleanliness of the restaurant, for a place you get really messy at, is pretty clean.  Boiling crab is most definitely my fave place to enjoy raw oysters. Their \"G sauce (homemade sauce with siracha, ketchup, lime, & black pepper)\" and a wiggle bit of freshly squeezed lime compliment the oysters soo well. I don't even bother to touch the Tabasco they give with the oysters.   Then my other go-to foods are snow crab, live crawfish, clams, and mussels. My husband normally gets shrimp and sausage so I try not to ever get any shrimp or sausage and have high hopes he'll share a piece or two with me. (I sure hope he does since I'm the one that peels his crab for him.) Anyways, like I said- you really can't go wrong with ordering anything here just because the sauce is full of flavor. Everything's amazing here!",

The king crab was about right for 2lbs and the snow crab I only got one cluster  and shrimp I felt was only about half of a lb. The flavors are just as I remembered service was ok .

( picture posted) Massage parlor across the street  The rating brought me here.....wtf? Yelp steered me wrong.  I was lured by the rating.  I had an uneasy feeling looking at the parking lot , the loitering , the neighborhood, the security cameras all over the restaurant , and the decor! ( should've listened to my gut)  Yes , the seafood prep and delivery is unique  The portions ample, you get to make a f-ing mess while eating.  Having commercial fished in Alaska  Had fresh dunginess, king crab, oysters, rock fish, salmon. I was completely disappointed how tough the meat of the seafood was.... frozen then over cooked?  Tough seafood is a sin , major sin in my book.  Flavors great, spices, great ...corn, great.   Looking at their ghetto ambiance, i should've known they wouldn't take a professional tack to seafood prep. Tough seafood.....seriously?.  Take lessons from sea galley Folks.  Am I being harsh?  For a 102 dollar meal no! Absolutely not!  It was a $50 dollar experience for $102 And I chewed on tough seafood.   I'll never return.",

However, after a 1-hour wait, the service was terrible, although the gal was friendly. After seating, it took another 15 mins to get food ordered, and then parts of our meal came out in sporadic times. Sold out of Blue Crab (their specialty) at 6pm on a Sunday.  Ordered lobster and Southern King crab, very disappointed in both. Crab was impossible to get out of the shells, and the 3lb lobster had about 4 ounces of edible meat. On top of that, we ordered drawn (melted) butter with all of it, which after asking FIVE times, was brought after we finished, and food was cold!  Seriously?? Paid $160 for $15 worth of dinner.. !! Actually left there, and went to another place because WE WERE STILL HUNGRY. Never again, I feel like we were fleeced. Half a star, only for the waitress that smiled. Feel sorry for her. Skip this one folks. Spend your money at a nicer venue and better quality seafood.",

Always packed with lots of flavor and the restaurant itself is always busy.  Im not even kidding when i say this is one of my favorite places and I LOVE it so much. I always get a pound of shrimp, the whole shabang mild.  But really 3 out of 5 times i come here the water tastes wierd and metallicy. Sometimes the water tastes fine but then the server refills it and it tastes metallicy. It might be the pitcher they use for refills or idk but i stopped complaining about it because it feels like the issue never gets fixed. I will complain about it and get a new water that tastes great, but then the next time i come in its the same issue. This doesnt stop me from coming here though, i just drink less water (lol). Its weird to even have a great restaurant where the food is amazing but the water doesnt taste normal.  Also sometimes I find pinchers in my pound of shrimp.  Recently theyve also been trying to be more eco-friendly with reducing straws which I can appreciate.  But def head here as soon as they open or youll likely hve a min 30 min wait!",

I think there were 4-5 pieces in the to-go box, but I can't remember for certain because I quickly started eating them all before I counted. The catfish were chunky and moist, but the breading wasn't as crunchy as some of the other Southern style restaurants I've tried. The fries limped out on me, so it's better to order those for dine-in only. My takeout was freshly cooked, and the wait wasn't overly long. I went on a Sunday around 1:00 p.m., and the restaurant was noisy and bustling inside. People who prefer a quiet meal should probably consider going to a different place. Service staff was friendly and efficient, and I thought the prices were reasonable for good seafood. Next time I'm craving softshell, I'll be heading back to The Boiling Crab!",

    "text": "First I would like to say customer service is a big thing to me at Restaurants. I don't care how good the food is. The food is just OK at this one. In my opinion it's gone down hill. I have eaten there before several times and the food was better. This time I went, there was to much oil in the sauce and I could taste that. I went with a group of of about 9 people for my birthday. My wife put our name in for 10 people. She and I were the first ones there. They set up a table for, we saw them do it. So I said can I sit there and have a beer. \"No you have to wait for your whole party\" very rudely. 5 others of our group came about 10 minutes later, there was 7 of us and they still would not let us sit down. We literally had to stare at the table that they made available for us. I was pretty upset and said lets go to \"Hot & Juicy\" same type of restaurant (better). Almost everyone was there and my group said no no, it's OK. (it's not OK). Finally the other 2 came. 30 minutes for a wait at a table that they had arranged for us. Really? So we order our food in the bags. I told the waiter I wanted only 3 potatoes in each bag 3 bags. He gave us 6 in each bag 18. A lot of my party was eating rice so way to many. I told the waiter why so many? He said yelling at me said no you ordered 6 in each bag! I was shocked and so was everyone else at the table. So I thought OK whatever. So we finish our food and my mom brought a birthday cake. My parents flew in from California, she is elderly. She went to ask the rude hostess who sat us if she she had any matches to light the candles, of course she said NO very rudely to my mom as if we were going to burn the place down. I took maters into my own hands and went out to my car to get matches. I will not be going back to this restaurant ever! If you like this type of food go to Hot & Juicy, They are way better and not rude and cheaper. Very near too.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d3568068-r620129353-The_Boiling_Crab-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=fe86f2fd2ef3711d66f95beb8a53bb49fddbed2f73a0982c0f0f13dd90b3a39e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

Came on a Friday night at 3pm and there were people already seated. Fancy that. We waited about 5 minutes before being seated at one of their booths. Parchment paper is laid out and bibs distributed. Kinda sad they didn't put them on us. Everything is dissaposable, from the cups to utensils, and even the parchment place mat.  While my friend order a lb of shabang shrimp, I got fried shit heaven. Ordered calamari, sweet potato fries, and a side of rice and shabang corn. Like I said, not a seafood lover.   Write on the table with ketchup....it's fun.   Our server was quick, attentive and the food came out quickly. The shabang sauce was crazy flavorful and I even added it to my rice. Practically drowned myself in it.

Only reason I didn't give a five star because the restroom needed attention. They addressed it but I had to bring it to their attention. Any time you're a restaurant or in the public the restroom should be top notch. The first thing I did was look at the score afterwards.",

    "text": "So I've been to a place in Albuquerque called Cracking Crap which has the same concept as Boiling crab. I will say I loved this place more!  I loved the feel and the atmosphere of this place.  It's an awesome place to come and have fun and eat amazing seafood!  It's unique because when you enter you see people have left their mark by writing names and dates from when they came.  Something I wish I had done.  But anywho maybe another time. We sat down and basically you order the type of seafood you want with the level of spicy that you want.  I will warn you that if you don't like spicy DO NOT get any level of spice to \"test\" yourself get the naked!!! Which although is no spice has a slight kick but nothing that will knock you on your butt. You can also order sides like rice or potatoes.  The rice they put in a side bowl and the potatoes they make in the bag with your seafood.  It may take you a little while to eat all your food but I promise you it will be worth it.   I know what your thinking, seafood is expensive.  Well yes it can be but here it's quite affordable even when certain seafood is at market price. It's a local spot which I highly recommend and yes I know it's only minutes from the strip where there is amazing high end seafood you can taste but hey why pay a fin and a tentacle when you can have affordable seafood? Just saying. So get off the busy strip and head to this local loved spot",

Great T.V. views if you want to watch a game and the table and eating areas are good sized tables with lots of elbow room.  The only complaint is how stinky my fingers are after eating but I am way too cool to wear the gloves.  There can be a wait some evenings so be prepared.",

CONS: I wish they peeled the shrimp. I spent over an hour just peeling shrimp. Not going to lie, it's a bit of work. The service was ok.   They did have an issue with their system for ordering so it delayed our meal by at least 45minutes. Crap happens, no big deal, they were kind enough to cut the bill in 1/2 for the delay which we never asked for. That was nice of them.   My husband however had \"toilet time\" afterwards so chances are, I doubt we will return.",

I got the duck confit and my husband got the kielbasa dish. Both very good. Finishing off we has a pot a creme flavored with caramel. To die for! Wine selection was perfect.

Huge variety of shrimp, crawfish, crab, oysters, and more. But it's their whole shabang sauce that really makes their seafood taste the best. Ask for extra sauce if you want it super juicy!  Today, my boyfriend and I got 3lbs or crawfish, 1lb of shrimp, sweet potato fries, and some rice for him as well. You can also add corn, potatoes, sausages, and more to mix in the bag to add flavor.  Their service is always great- I would come here on any occasion (that's how good it is!)",

    "text": "Experience:  I was in the neighborhood, hungry, and checked YELP for what I had bookmarked. My friend thought she had a Groupon, so that settled it...Boiling Crab for lunch.   Facility: this is kinda tucked away in the inside of a shopping centers facing away from the street. It is a fairly good size place with some booths and chairs and tables for seating. It had some cool artwork on the wall created from bottle caps.   Service: One the waitresses was nice enough, but was a little irritating when we asked for XXX on the scale. She said are you sure? And both of us said yes...then she continued to tell us this is like \"blazing\" at BWW.  Ok? I think we already told you twice what we wanted. So we then said yes again, we are sure. Funny thing is, it actually wasn't even that hot. Other than that the service was pretty good.   Food: I ordered fried oysters and a bowl of Gumbo. My friend got the pound of shrimp with the everything favors and XXX heat. I tasted her shrimps and they were cooked good, but it was just too sweet for me.  My Fried Oysters [3.5/5] were cooked pretty good.  They came with a Sriacha type sauce that was waaaaayyy too sweet, but luckily I ordered the tarter sauce on the side already.  Then I tried the Gumbo [4/5] which was surprisingly tasty. It had a little bit too much of a spice I could not place, but it was still good. Glad it actually had okra in it, and they served it popping hot!  Overall:  the food was decent, so I'm not sure how to explain this, but there's just nothing that makes me want to go back. It was better to me than Hot and Juicy, but again, maybe it's a Louisiana thang, where I'm just not being fair to anyone claiming Creole or Cajun food.  You better bring it.  Anyway, might come back if friends are coming, but probably not on my own.",

It is a seafood lovers selection of hot crab,lobster, clams, shrimp and more (But be warned whenever I have had shrimp here they have been overcooked)  For newbies I recommend you get your fish in butter (it's actually not real butter) and get a \"side\" of whole shabang mild and use it as a dipping sauce. make sure you grab plenty of napkins this is gonna get messy!

Prices are affordable, except the lobster, i felt was overpriced for an overcooked, dried lobster, but other than that, and it's not like we get lobster each visit. The only other thing, their women's bathroom needs a renovation or to be cleaned all the time, since its old. Atmosphere is a variety of people in age group & ethnicity.

Nothing beats the shebang sauce with your choice of seafood and a variety of sides such as corn, potatoes and delicious sausages. My go to menu items are shrimp or crab with half a pound of sausages and a side of corn. My only issue with this place is the long wait on weekends and price increase in the last few months but that hasn't stopped me from my frequent visits. The restaurant is very spacious with ample parking and great customer service. If you plan to go on a weekend day between 6-8pm be prepared to wait at least 30-45 mins. Worth the wait in my book.",

    "text": "So, I've been transplanted to the Grand Canyon from Houston, Texas, and I've been looking for some great, spicy crawfish. I'm spoiled by a place back home called Hanks's. My first attempt was Hot 'n Juicy. It was very so-so, giving a flavor similar to tobacco spit. Yes, I'm not kidding. In Houston, I was used to 5 to 7 dollars/lb. for restaurant crawfish, and here in Vegas it was $10/lb, so I was at least expecting passable. Now I've discovered The Boiling Crab, And it's GREAT!  Much better than HnJ, like everyone else seems to be saying. The only reason that I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they have really high prices. 10 dollars per pound for crawfish is almost punitive!  They were happy to increase the garlic and spice, and it really paid off! Beer selection would have been better if they had a bock, Shiner or Ziegen, prefereably. I'm sure that if Double Down saloon can get Shiner, then so can BC, right? If you're from the south, it's the only game in town! Note, if you get the spiced and cooked crawfish from Smith's, it just doesn't get it.",

I ordered 1lb of shrimp and 1lb of crawfish and split a fried catfish basket (5pcs w/fries). I ordered everything in medium spiciness to test the waters of heat. The waiter said it would be probably hotter by one level for most but for me the medium was a mild for me (barely a runny nose). Next time I'll go for the XXX the hottest level maybe. Compared to Hot and Juicy for spice levels The Boiling Crab is just a tick lower. Service was generally good the servers came by often enough that our sodas rarely ran dry and checked up if we needed anything. The atmosphere of the place is your typical beach shack wood planking and fishing equipment strewn about with plenty of TVs  and elbow room between tables unlike the coziness of Hot N Juicy. Hard to say which of the 2 places I like better. I guess competition is good!",

My first time there we had raw oyster plate, and few pounds of shrimp and clams with their yummy sauce, everything went well and we all had a happy meal, but 1 hour later, I had my first allergic reaction EVER in my life where I got itches everywhere and swollen up, that night I ended up in an emergency room(bills didn't look too pretty at all), however all my other friends were fine, wierd,  I grew up eating seafood and never recall myself ever being allergic to it, so all my friends thought I must be allergic to oyster that I just didn't know about it but I highly doubt it.  Second time we went there without oyster and I was actually fine.  The 3rd time I was there, I was eating and found a \"sick\" looking clam got mixed in the bag, when I opened it it's all black goo inside,  I had clam before but was fine so I just threw away the bad one and continue eating, yup, I had another allergic reaction again that night.  I now highly suspect that I'm allergic to \"dirty\" seafood, or not-so-fresh seafood, I'm afraid to ask the country of origin of the oyster and whatever happen to that clam, but I will never go back there again to risk my pocket and my life.  Oh BTW, I didn't believe I have allergy to oyster so I order raw oyster from a Japanese restaurant, I can clearly tell the quality and the taste of the oyster from Japanese restaurant is so much better, and that night I was totally fine! So there you go.",

The environment is nice enough with plenty of TVs, viewable from the right tables even if the quality of the signal isn't crystal clear. Service was pronto. I don't think the water glasses fell below half, which was good given that it costs ya a quarter! However, the fried shrimp basket was simply not that great. The shrimp were a tad overfried and appeared to be a different quality than the ones served up in bags. They were smaller. I did finish up every last one of the cajun fries. I think I was addicted to the spice. Overall, if my husband demands a bag of crustaceans, this will probably not be my top choice as a tag along, and although he enjoyed his food, I don't think he will be missing these saucy critters as much as he might miss some others.",

    "text": "If it wasn't for the Boiling Crab in Koreatown, CA, Boiling Crab LV would have received my 5 stars.  The two Crabs were complete strangers from a different shore.  BC Koreatown's Sha-Bang sauce had more.. Sha-Bang!  Twice as flavorful, garlicy, oniony, salty, tasty!  BC LV's Sha-Bang was lacking the Bang Bang.. the sauce was bland and watered down.  I guess that's what you get from seafood served in the desert.  But as I was working through my bag o' shrimp, I started to gain momentum and found myself devouring my 1 pounder and everything left in it.  I have developed an acquired taste for BC LV and have dismantled my fanfare for BC Koreatown.  BC LV had become my official rebound.  If you are dining at BC.. I suggest ordering all three seperate flavors on your choice of crustacean and then try the Sha-Bang just so your options stay open (cuz u know what they say.. \"once you go 'Sha-Bang' you'll never go back.\").  All the fried goods are mighty delish.  The fried Catfish and Oysters are always a good side dish.. it changes the game a 'bit for when things get a little too saucy.  Never go riceless.. the rice will balance the sodium imbalanced meal.  Use the unlimited supply of lime, salt & pepper to increase or decrease your levels of yum.. this ain't no meal for pansies!  ..and finally a Quicktip:  Forget about washing your hands.. use the leftover lime to degrease, scent and ungrime 'em butterfingers.  Did you know: A Crab's teeth are in its stmoach which is also the SAUCIEST!",

The shrimp comes with the head on  and are not deveined, but i did all that myself and mmm mmm mmm it was grrrreat!  The king crab legs... OMG them legz was on pizoint (point), i mean they had lots of meat in em, the spicy season blend was just bangin (good)! The corn mixed in with the cajun season boy o boy... i mean i was in heaven! Also i think because i rarely eat cajun, when you eat something new and delicious its almost like a instant gratification! I will definitely eat here again and recommend to friends family or anybody reading this post!",

    "text": "So I heard this boiling crab place is really popular in California, so we definitely had to try this place out. My husband who is from there swears up & down that the food here is good even though he Is allergic to shrimp (but only when he wants to be). As newbies to this joint we definitely had to emblazon our names and words of wisdom on the lovely walls of this establishment (yes it is perfectly OK to vandalize the walls, they will even provide you with a sharpie). The menu is pretty simple (or so it seems) how many pounds of shrimp, lobster etc... You want and what kind of style sauce or how spicy you want it...problem is have you ever measured your food intake as to how many pounds? It was a good thing we had experts with us. For for people we had about 1 lb of shrimp & about 1/2 a lb of clams with sausage and a basket of fries, it didn't seem like much for people, but when we got our plastic bags (yes the main entrees are placed in plastic bags & nothing else just like how they do it when you go eat at the pier in redondo beach) it was a lot & was definitely enough for us. Keep in mind they have no plates nor any silverware and YOU MUST LEARN TO EAT WITH YOUR HANDS! so you can savor the goodness of their finger licking Cajun style spicy sauce that your seafood is drenched in. Word of advice though, as we all already know, seafood tends to get pretty pricey, so please do order in moderation, and try as much as you can to visualize how many pounds of food your party can consume so your bill can be somewhat reasonable. This was definitely worth the experience though, worth it enough even for my husband to give this place a \"shrimp\"  exemption.",

All of them were EXTREMELY DRY. the shrimp were overcooked, some of it were mushy, some of it you can barely peel coz the shell's all sticking to the meat. the lobster was a disappointment, cracked it open, and the meat was dry and tough. the crab legs were the same, dry and tough meat everywhere. the flavor of the sauce (we got the whole shebang one) was a little bland for our taste. the interior decor was nice though, but as far as the food, not a big fan.",

Not only is the seafood fresh not frozen and then thawed, the seasoning is really good and adjusted to taste so it's not plain for anyone who likes some spice in their food, it actually made it better. The price is also reasonable for what you are getting which is seafood, definitely will not break the bank. The service was good and the ambience was great specially for groups or two people if that is your choice. Being that it is hard to find good seafood places outside the Strip this is a good place to come to and not have to deal with traffic, parking, and paying more at some other places for the same thing. This has become a favorite place for me since I am a seafood lover.",

    "text": "BOILING CRAB vs. HOT & JUICY  Essentially, the experience is the same. You order seafood by the pound. They drench it in a sauce and serve it in a bag on your table. I don't really like this kind of food. I wouldn't have cravings for it. But after experiencing both, I prefer Boiling Crab over Hot & Juicy for a number of different reasons.   LOCATION: Close to my house! at Flamingo & Decatur in the Food4Less shopping center. The restaurant is HUGE. 2-3 times the size of H&J with much higher ceilings. Unlike H&J, you can smell the food but there's enough fresh breathing air at BC for everyone.   SEAFOOD: You have the option of choosing fresh or frozen crawfish. The fresh is supposed to taste a little better at double the cost but the frozen is much larger. We got the frozen and I didn't think anything bad of it except one or two of the buggers had an awful ocean taste (the bad kind). Shrimp can be ordered in half-lb increments (the ones we got were overcooked). 1 lb of Snow Crab is 5 legs and some body. Definitely need at least 1 lb / person if your doing crab.  SAUCE: We tried a variety of the sauces. Lemon Pepper, Cajun, and the whole sha-bang. We went with all Mild heat. H&J has a tendency to be ridiculously spicy (as in heat) even when you order Mild. The Medium over there killed me! The sauce at BC was wonderful. The Sha-Bang was definitely my favorite. Full of flavor and spice, heavy on the garlic, but not to hot. I'll probably go Medium the next time I come.   SIDES: Freshest fresh oysters in Vegas! They were tasty, meaty, and had a healthy gloss to them. I could've eaten a whole dozen myself! The ones I've received at H&J in the past were subpar quality and not that great. And what's not to like about sweet potato fries?   SERVICE: We had a few different people serving us. Luckily, there were no mistakes on our order and everyone was pretty friendly. H&J servers aren't attentive and they always get something wrong.   DRINKS: No liquor license yet. Its coming though. I hear 25 cents for a cup of water?  We ordered iced tea. But they've got sweet tea as well.  PRICES: We got 1/2 lb shrimp, 1 lb crawfish, 1 lb snow crab, sweet potato fries, dozen oysters, and 2 iced teas. Bill was $25 per person. Not bad!  H&J / BC really isn't my type of food. But if my friends want some buttery cajun seafood then I'd pick Boiling Crab over other places.  Don't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)",

    "text": "Dined in at The Boiling Crab two days after their grand opening. They had a section for take out and a section for people to sit down and wait . All the workers were very nice and friendly . They sat us down right away and gave us bibs and menus . I did happen to notice that they were over staffed so they were standing around and looked a little bored.   I went their w/my sister and daughter , my daughter is 2 and sometimes she eats the shrimp and sometimes she doesn't . So I liked how they have chicken fingers because then my daughter was able to eat the chicken and the non spicy fries. Their chicken tenders are very crispy and meaty, not to much batter. very good for kids.  All the food came out fast , we didn't have to wait long. I like how I can have my butter garlic craw fish and shrimp non spicy so that I can share everything I have with my daughter. The seasoning is very tasty and the sauce has a thick consistency which I enjoy for extra dipping. not too plain nor too salty. My sister and I enjoy their dozen oysters. small but taste fresh.",

The lemon pepper mild spicy had the right kick to it, considering I don't eat a lot of spicy food. The calamari was also cooked to perfection. The ambiance was nice and very laid back.

Very open with lots of seating. They also have booths along the sides for more private and smaller groups.  Service- Our waitress was attentive and helpful. Everyone was friendly. The food also arrived very quickly, which was nice since I was starving.   Food- We order oysters on a half shell. It was fresh and the cocktail sauce was tasty. We had a group of 8 so I ordered rice, 2lbs snow crab legs, 1lb clams, 2lbs shrimp, 1lb sausage, and 8 corns.  We choose the whole sha-bang mild sauce for everything. The flavor of the sauce was very tasty especially with a squeeze of lime. I poured some of the sauce onto my rice and went native with my hands.   Everyone really enjoyed themselves. I thought it was fairly reasonable considering it was seafood and a party of 8.  I'm definitely a fan!",

    "text": "The food is okay but service can improve, A LOT.  FOOD (first order) 1) Catfish Basket with Fries (Med heat) $10:  Best thing! The basket comes with large pieces of fried catfish.  They taste amazing, tender, and extremely moist ^_^ The fries are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside (my fave way to eat it!).  The Med seasoning is a dry season and was pretty good as it had a teeny tiny kick but you can still taste the food.  2) Gumbo with rice $6: Dont get this item.  Totally not worth it!! The gumbo was pretty bland that I had to put in a ton of Tabasco to make it taste like anything.  They barely give you any rice (please see the Service note below).   3) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and Med heat) $10/pound:  When the bag was first placed on the table, all you see are super large crawfish soaking in a bath of liquid yumminess.  Then you grab one and is let down that there isn't even a small kick to the Med heat.  And the more you dig in, the more you notice the crawfish are smaller and smaller.  Yes i understand that it is still by weight so its not like you're getting cheated... but I want big ones and that's that!!  FOOD (2nd round of orders):  1) Chicken Tender with Fries (XXX heat) $7:  The chicken tenders aren't anything special and the pieces are not large (but at least they weren't small lol).  Same fries except the XXX seasoning was all heat and no taste.    2) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and XXX heat) $10/pound: So i should have explain their heat level earlier - the XXX is suppose to be the hottest one as its stated on the menu \"Cant feel my mouth\" and the level right above that is the Med... They need to figure out something to go in between the Med and XXX.  The XXX was indeed spicier then the Med but if you're a restaurant you should know that a hot level should still mean you maintain the taste of your food!   There was so much cayenne/chili pepper in the dry XXX heat that you couldn't taste any of the food.  All you get is a coating of dry power that overwhelm your taste buds.    I would like to make a point that is probably not that important but for me I feel like its something worth noting... They only give you one corn when you purchase at least 2lb. bag of crawfish. Which is fine... but where is the potato!?!? Yes I know this isnt Hot n' Juicy... but where is it!?!?!  SERVICE: Where should I start... So our server didnt introduce himself so i'm only assuming his name is Spencer since it was on our check which may not be correct since half way through another waiter assisted us.   He wasnt really friendly as we had to ask about pricing for everything.  I'm sorry, if I'm inquiring about pricing, wouldn't you assume i would like to be inform and you should be nice to let me know instead of me having to pull teeth????  Our waiter talked my fiance out of ordering the XXX the first time around, which is  fine and we took it as friendly advice.  However, when we got our Med heat orders we wanted something spicier, we asked if we can get a small side of the dry XXX seasoning so we can get more kick.  We were told he cant do that but if we wanted to order something else such a side order of corn, I can get the corn in a big soaked with liquid XXX sauce... great so if I want to season my food to my liking, you're going to make me buy more... right... This annoys me the most since he was the one convincing us not to order the XXX in the first place.    Anyway moving on... I ordered the Gumbo with Rice and I didnt get gumbo with rice.  The whole reason for going to Boiling Crab was cause I was craving rice with lots of sauce!  And what could satisfy my craving for saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope, didnt even hit the stop.  I had to stop another waiter and tell her that I didnt get my correct order.  Instead of just bringing me a cup of rice, she takes my whole cup back to the kitchen and comes back with it...when i get my cup back, it looked like someone took 1 spoonful of rice and dumped it in.  I didnt realize rice was such an expensive item that I cant even get more than 1 spoonful.    So after all this interaction, our waiter comes by and ask us how we were doing.  My fiance being the nice guy that he is says everything is great where I said things werent so good.  I'm pretty sure our waiter thought I was being sarcastic since my comment came after my fiance and it assume it was though \"oh its awful but i'm still stuffing my face that's its obviously amazing food\"... nope, I didnt say it like that or mean it like that.  He just walks off like nothing happened.    So i'm writing this review a few hours after my visit to Boiling Crab... and in our group only three of us had their \"fresh\" crawfish... and now all three of us arent feel so well.    That sums up my extremely delight experience and will never stop back in that place and any of their other locations.  EVER.",

Besides the fact that throwing food all over the table and writing on the window sills is acceptable behavior, the seafood is delicious and leaves you wanting more.   When choosing a flavor for your bag of crustaseans or friends, \"the whole shebang\" is a must. It's a blend of lemon, garlic and cajun..YUM. Trust me, you'll never go back to one flavor once you've had that.   When my friends and I visited, the snow crab legs were the best (I'm not a huge fan of crawfish and the shrimp was good, but boring). Even their cajun fries were fun and the wings weren't too bad either (my fiance doesn't like shellfish very much). Oh, and you have the ability to choose your level of heat on all items.   The service was pretty blotchy with very little attention and long wait times for assistance, however everyone was very friendly. It's definitely a great place to go with a few friends or your family for a casual meal and just get messy. I'm already considering my next trip there!",

The whole shabang is the combination of all their sauces. Even mild has a kick and especially since you're eating so much of it, the medium can build up heat fast.   My friend got their naked pound of shrimp which doesn't come with any sauces but is boiled with sausage, potato and corn. It's a much lighter version and the whole bag is only 410 calories. With the pepper dip and lime, he said it was really enjoyable.   Be ready to get messy!  You eat with your hands and the sauce gets everywhere. But fear not they give your bibs to keep your clothes clean.   Sometimes there can be a wait but this restaurant is huge and can accommodate a lot of people.

I wouldn't recommend being babies and toddlers - spicy/ sticky fingers and baby handling just don't mesh well (kuddos for those who manage).  2. Don't wear your Sunday best or dry clean only stuff - you will smell of Cajun spices and garlic down to your undies. 3) Wash your hands and empty your bladders before you start the feast!",

    "text": "I've been to at least 7 boiling crab locations in California and this is my second time coming to the Las Vegas location. Generally, the food usually always tastes the same it's usually small details in the food that distinguish each location but it's hardly noticeable. My two-star rating is based on customer service and their portions.   I'll start with the portions. We ordered a pound of shrimp, Cajun wings (small size, we've always received 6 wings) Cajun fries and drinks.   When we received our basket of fries we were disappointed that they were not filled. It was a very noticeable difference between the fries we've consistently received at California locations versus the ones we received. The next thing is that we always order all our food \"XXX\". We already knows how spicy it can possibly get so we really don't mind and we know what we're getting ourselves into. When we received our fries they looked like McDonald's fries. They hardly had any seasoning and weren't spicy at all. That was very disappointing.   The wings were another problem. We have always ordered the wings. Depending on our appetite we'll either go with small (6 wings) or large (9 wings). So when we received our wings we only got 5. We thought they made a mistake since we've always received 6, but our server said their portions were different at their location. Bummer.   Next negative was when we requested ranch. They charged us .75 cents for ranch. We've never been charged for ranch at any of the locations but here they were so quick to let us know that it would be an up charge for each ranch. Pretty ridiculous when hamburger places usually don't fuss about it.   Last complaint is on the service. Our original server told us that he was assigned a big party behind us and that he would tell other servers to pick up the slack to help us out. I knew this was bad news because nobody ever showed up to check on us or offer us drink refills. We had to wave someone down to stop by for any request that we had which was pretty frustrating. Nobody gave us our bill so I had to walk over to the cash register to ask to be charged. The place wasn't so busy for me to expect suck bad service I just think they weren't very good at managing their servers. This is my worst experience at any boiling crab location and it was very disappointing.",

First thing that should have told me it was good, it was busy as a beehive and we had to wait at 5 PM.  First step is to order your seafood.  Next step is to order your flavor and then how spicy you want it.  I ordered the crab legs with the whole sha-bang (all three styles mixed together) XXX style.  After they boil it, they bring at this spicy bag of goodness.  I consider myself a professional in the spicy area and I could taste the hotness.  Your only silverware is your left and right hand along with a crab cracker.  This place proves that bibs are not just for babies.  I was very happy smiling at everybody who was waiting for a table after such a seafood delight.",

Prepare to wait patiently. Drinks can be ordered at the To-Go counter & hold you down until it's time to eat.   No matter what other similar concept-style place I try, The Boiling Crab's sauce always wins. It's not too salty, oily, or sweet like others I've tried, IMO. My family loves coming here because the space can accommodate us, it's casual, fun, & super kid friendly. For some reason, other families think it's so kid friendly that they let their kids become barbaric. Dear parents, please keep your offspring seated, pick up that corn they threw on the ground!   The women's restroom needed lots of attention. This location needs dessert & upgraded TVs. It's a great place for people watching. The music is good but super random. The staff were fast & pretty friendly. Some would rush off without letting me ask for my spoon, but other than that, my family & I will continue to come back.",

The shrimp is over cooked of course not all of us might notice it since it all soaked in that Cajun sauce but it is dry. Crab legs awesome! Snow crabs can be a bit prickly but will do once you get that crab meat. My server needs a little smiling ( poor customer service ) but I'm sure not all of em are like that. Plenty of parking and it gets packed during the weekend specially dinner time. No dessert! So if you trying to get the seafood taste out of your choppers forget it. But it's good not bad at all . It won't be my first choice to go but I will come back from time to time. Happy crabbing!",

I had the snow crab legs, crawfish, shrimp with sausages and the whole shebang sauce. It was mouth watering and everything tasted so gooddddd!! The service was also great!! Mariah our server always checked on us and she put the bibs on for us. Kudos! Thanks for an amazing lunch before we hit the road back to arizona! Ill make sure to come back again when I visit! 5 stars highly recommended!",

The messier the better as they totally encourage it.  I selected the fried calamari, 1 pound of shrimp with the whole sha-bang seasoning as well as seasoned fries. I really enjoyed this meal a lot and I was totally moaning and LOUD. I love shrimp so that is a no brainer choice when I come here. I also enjoyed their sweet and juicy corn on the cob. I was squirting all over the place while eating the corn off the cob, it is super seasoned, juicy and SWEET!  I must mention that my friend ordered a pound of king crab legs and they were Amazing. She gave me a leg that was more like the size of an arm. That meat was so plump juicy and sweet that I almost lost my mind while savoring it.  This was a last minute treat from a new friend of mine, I was truly spoiled today!  Mmmmm the food and service is great I really like The boiling crab!  I am pleased to announce that The boiling crab has bumped up to 5 stars from my last review rating of 4 stars.",

The seasoning was okay but at the bottoms of the bags ALL the seasoning is at the bottom so you're really overwhelmed by salt and spice, not that great. The food isn't bad at all, but it's slightly overpriced in my opinion. I got one kind crab and 1 lb of shrimp and mussels and my bill was $100+. Definitely wasn't worth maybe more than $40/50.",

During my second visit our waiter messed our oreders up and was non-apologetic. The manager was very accommodating by taking 30% off the entire bill and making food fresh.   All in all, its a good place with stingy portions, good flavor, and friendly staff.",

The restaurant was packed with customers and food was coming out quick. We ordered fried calamari and Cajun fries as an appetizer. The calamari was nice and tender with a good batter. One of them had like a bone or something in the batter but we really didn't have a dipping sauce like other similar restaurants just regular cocktail sauce. Our Cajun fries were ok, nice and crispy but fell short of Cajun flavor, tasted like it was just paprika. We ordered two pounds of shrimp, one with a pound of sausage, corn and potatoes. Flavor we got was the whole sha-bang with med flavor and the other was the same but XXX for spice. The whole imp was full of flavor but wasn't oily or creamy as I would of like it. I thought the sauce was more gritty than watery. Our waiter was awesome and the restaurant was very clean. I would come here again and try the other flavor and definitely get XXX for spice. Med was spicy but I thought XXX was awesomeness me for spice. Come and give this place a try.",

I ordered mild with whole shabang flavor and it was still too spicy for me. If you can't handle spicy like me order non-spicy. I love the king crab leg the best. It was juicy. The Cajun sauce was flavorful too.  I will definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas.  On last note, they don't have wifi so talk to each other.

I was disappointed that when we sat down they only had frozen crawfish. It is what it is... I don't know about the season for crawfish so I suppose that would be why. We ordered both shrimp and crawfish with their special shabang sauce. I loved the garlic but the seasoning was off.. It was quite salty for my liking. But I loved that they were able to make it spicy too.. All in all, its not that bad of a place but if I was to to again ever... I'd probably just get something fried like fried shrimp.

This is like the 4th time this has happened and all manager can say is \"the food is made to order.\" I mean i'd hope the food is made to order aren't all restaurants? And what is the reason for the fries taking so long? Oh let me tell you according to management it takes the fries longer (20 minuets) because they are fried... God, I could only imagine if I had to wait 20 minuets in the drive thru at a fast food joint for some fries and then drive back through again to pick up my burger. I get it but then again l don't get.

Tear away paper or some sort of plasticky paper serves as your tablecloth and plates that can just be gathered to haul away the garbage when cleaning up.  I'm a little disappointed in the time it took to get our food. We ordered two dozen raw oysters, 4 lbs of shrimp with no spice and mild spice shebang. There are a few options on how to receive your shrimp from no spice to 10/10 can't feel my face spiciness. Also ordered 5 orders of rice and 6 corn on the cob which was in a bag of beautiful clarified butter. The shrimp arrived in two bags because of the difference in the levels of spice. Delicious flavour!! Suck the heads as you pull them off. Damn good. Refills are free for drinks and even can change to another beverage. The server was friendly and even put our bibs on. I'm so happy to be back here for a 2nd time. The food didn't disappoint the 2nd time around. They could've managed the wait times a bit better as there were a few empty tables and a huge lineup.

After hearing so many rave reviews from friends, I had to experience it for myself.  Originally, my group was suppose to be larger, but a few backed out last minute. As with most restaurants, they prefer the whole party to be present before seating. The hostess was sweet and offered me a water while I waited and checked on my parties status a couple of times. When some friends dropped off, she sat me since the party shrank enough to not have to move any tables.  The food was on par with the other places, but the prices were cheaper. Most of the items are comparable, but the crawfish were dirt cheap. We got 2lbs for $12. I normally don't order them because the meat to shell ratio tends to leave little reward for cost, but at this price it didn't matter.",

Ive never been to any place like this before living in Arizona and all there is nothing like it. Next closes is Vegas or California. First time ever eating here was in July 2012 I was in Vegas for my brothers 21st birthday and the last day before we left everyone decided to come here to eat. I was pretty amused on the big wax paper they laid out on the table and knowing that everything that you eat will be all over and you can just throw your trash onto the table. They also give you a bib knowing how messy it will get. You also can eat with your hands if you wanted too. I was pretty excited on eating here. Of all the times Ive been to Vegas I never knew about this place.   I ended up ordering 1 pound of shrimp with cajun seasoning and a side of white rice, my BF ordered the Jambalaya with a side of Calamari. It was definately delicious. I loved it. The prices may be a bit much but totally worth it.   We loved this place soo much that when we came back to Vegas for a wedding in December 2012, we ended up eating here again on the last day before we left. Its like a tradition to eat here every time we are in Vegas. I ordered my normal 1 pound of shrimp and this time my BF ordered 1 pound of shrimp with sausages. The amount that we get is soo fufulling.   You have to come here when it opens because it can get pretty crowded. And Im usually with like 20 or more people so we have to get there before everyone else does to get a table that can seat all of us.   Now that I live in norcal I've found out that they have a location in San Jose which is not too far if we ever decide that we are craving for some BC we can just drive like a hour instead of 7-8 hours to Vegas. Thats quite exciting for me.",

We waited around 20 minutes, which was pretty reasonable. We got the whole shebang at medium spice with a pound of shrimp, which was not quite spicy enough for us but it was good. We also ordered a fried catfish basket, two orders of fried chicken wings and cajun fries. Service is good, as it is with the other locations. Everyone was happy with their dinner and this certainly was a better option than dining in one of the restaurants on the strip.",

    "text": "First off - I'm not a girl that is okay with mess. Not even a little bit. As such, it was tough for me to get on board with the idea of eating at a place that delivers saucy shrimp in a plastic bag - only for their patrons to then DUMP the contents onto their butcher-paper-lined tables. I mean, seriously - EW.   But it was the touristy thing to do, so we took a trip to The Boiling Crab on one of our recent visits to the City of Sin.   From the moment we entered, it quickly began to win my heart over. It was the little things, really. An area for you to leave your mark on the (Boiling Crab) world via a Sharpie marker, a la old school Gino's East establishments. Iced Green Tea on the menu. Super-fun plastic bibs that I couldn't resist donning almost immediately. And - could it be?! - sweet potato fries on the menu! SCORE!  Unable to get past the ick factor of spilling out a bunch of shrimp juice onto my portion of the table - not to mention that I don't actually know how to peel my own shrimp - I opted for the much safer 'Fried Shrimp Basket.' It did not disappoint! Battered, but not overly so, and with a flavor that I've yet been able to match with other fried shrimp joints - I was not at all jealous of my dining companions (who were up to their knuckles in shrimp-y goodness).   And, for the piece de resistance - the sweet potato fries. I would come here again and again for these alone. Thin cut, incredibly crispy, and salted to a science - I didn't want to share! They were perfect for alternating with the 'XXX Cajun Fries,' as those suckers were seriously spicy. Like embarrassed-because-you-thought-you-could-handle-it-but-you-coughed-after-taking-just-a-bite spicy.   To top it all off, service here is always amazing. Servers are beyond friendly, and bring refills on your drinks before you even realize you need one. My only gripe? That they haven't opened any Boiling Crabs in the Midwest yet!",

We came a week ago on a non- busy time. The difference was the size of the food. We always order a pound of shrimp and fries. On a Sunday, the fries were not a full basket. When she came out with the shrimp, we automatically thought \"this cannot be a pound. It's too small\". We didn't make any complaints because we knew we would enjoy the food and we would be back regardless. Definitely five stars. But like I said, do not go during a busy time.",

They have all been enticing and delicious with great service! Unfortunately, Vegas failed to meet the previous standards that I have been set and met with.  Fries were great. But of course, it's the same as everywhere else because I mean, who the heck can fail at frying fries??  The shrimps were a disappointment. They were served cold. And because it takes time to finish your food, the shrimps got even colder. Colder as if they were simulated to be back in the ocean which they came from...   I actually haven't been here for a while and almost forgot that BC is around because I  unfortunately did not like our local BC. I guess I'll have to give Hot n Juicy a tryout to my taste buds!",

I'm a criminal defense attorney and people were loud, drunk and profane. It felt like I was eating crab in the middle of arraignment court. Unpleasant if you have a family with small kids.

    "text": "Every time we come to Vegas we fulfill our crawfish cravings.  Up to this point we have only experienced Hot N Juicy crawfish.  After reading the reviews on boiling crab I felt confident we would have a great evening.  Sadly, that was not the case and at this point our experience has to be the worst dining experience we have had in 2012.     Let's start with the good.  We went on a Thursday and were seated right away.  We ordered a couple punds of crawfish 1 with the cajun spice 1 med and 1 mild some boiled shrimp and some fried shrimp and fries for our young son (2.5yrs).   The boiled food all came out together and was prompt and tasted good to great no complaints here.    Now the bad. First, the fried food came out at least 10-15 minutes after the boiled food so I was left managing a hungry toddler trying to keep him out of the spicy food.   We had to track down another server to get them to check on it.    Then we immediately ordered some additional boiled crawfish. After 15 to 20 minutes of no food and no server we sought someone out to figure it out. Another 10 minutes and our server shows up saying they must of sent our order to another table. She rushed our order and offered 25% discount. A nice gesture but sadly the poor service continued, as our toddler continued his downward spiral we tried to get our check and waited another 10 minutes.   Over all the service was lacking and inattentive.   The food was good but I found the crawfish to be a tad overcooked and hard to peel. I probably wouldn't have noticed that if I wasn't already upset by the poor service.    The crawfish were large and flavorful but the sauce spicy levels were hard to distinguish.     Overall a disappointing experience.  We are headed back to hot n juicy on this trip to salvage our crawfish dining experience.",

Got the king crab, snow crab, shrimp, corn and potatoes with mild shabang seasoning which is all three seasoning in one bag! Soooooo good!!! Mild was hot enough but not too hot.  If you like it a little hot then get medium.  A little savage with no plates or utensils and shrimp juicy all over my bib but it added to the experience!!! Customers can draw on the walls so check out my bunny with the word \"Lam!\" right next to it, on the pillar near the door when you come in!!",

    "text": "I first tried Boiling Crab when I was in Cali with my friends. I immediately fell in love with this place. Being Filipino I usually eat with my hands at times because that is just my culture, but here you get to as well! They line your table up with a huge \"paper like\" lining because it does get messy, but usually delicious foods are messy right? The way you order goes all the way down to what sauce you prefer and how spicy you want. Choices of food includes crab, shrimp, oysters, crawfish, hot wings, clams just to name a few populars. Boiling Crab is one of my favorite places to eat at. I have probably been here at least 10 times already with my friends and any time a family member or someone I know is visiting in town I would take them here. They are usually almost packed when I come here so that tells you a lot. I just love seafood and this place just satisfies me every single time I come here.",

    "text": "I have been here 6 times, but this is my first time I have written a review.  My experience the first 5 times was good.  I like the flavor of the sauce and had good experiences.  In fact, on my recommendation, one of my friends had her birthday party here.  Everyone had a good time and we ended up with a bill over $400 but it was worth it.      Why the 2 stars you ask?  Because visit 6 SUCKED!  And I mean SUCKED BAD.  I ordered a pound of shrimp with a corn.  The food runner dropped off the shrimp and repeated the order then took off to deliver to another table.  Right away I noticed two things, there was no corn and that the amount of shrimp in the bag was very small.  When we got a hold of an employee, we told her that there was no corn and asked if that was a pound.  She held up the bag and asked if we ordered a full pound or a half.  We replied that we ordered a full pound.  She said that this couldn't be our order and took the bag away.  A couple minutes later, the chicken wings arrived.  They were excellent as always.  By the time we finished the wings, the shrimp still hadn't arrived.  Our original server dropped off a corn in a bag, but no shrimp.  The first girl came by a few minutes later and said that the first bag had to be our order because she has been watching it and nobody has taken it.  Then to my shock, she said that she would go get it.  I told her that I didn't want that bag because after 15 min of steaming in the bad, it would be way overcooked.  She looked a but stunned and paused.  I told her not to bring me that same bag.  At the same time, the original server was bringing it over.  She intercepted him and told him that I didn't want that bag.  They went over to the cashier area and discussed something with some others.  They came over and told me that the order was being remade.  To this point, I was fine with the proceedings.  I figured that \"shit happens\" and no big deal.  Then the shrimp arrived.  If someone tells me that wasn't the same shrimp, I'll tell them that they are a f'kn liar.  The shrimp was so overcooked that all of the heads had fallen off.  The meat was mush and stuck to the shells.  Either that was the same bag, or they should fire the cook immediately because he or she can't cook.",

    "text": "It was my first time at this location I've been to the ones in the LA area plenty of times but I'm in Vegas for the week & seafood was calling my name & what better news than to find out there's a boiling crab out here ! Man was I looking forward to this ... But nope I came out pretty disappointed, first of all they're very unorganized, the waiters/waitress aren't as attentive as they should be, my gf asked for ranch for her chicken tenders they never brought it she had to get up and ask for it at the counter also for some lime since they didn't bother to stop by and ask if everything was well or if we needed anything. We ordered a Corn on the cob along with everything else we originally ordered & we never received it so once I received my bill I noticed they were still charging for the corn on the cob so I politely told the girl if she could remove it of my bill because we didn't receive it & she asked me if I had asked anyone about it ? & of course I could have asked any of the other waiters  but that's why you took my order down, right? & even if we had asked anyone else it's not like they were coming by our table. The food wasn't any better, my two pounds of shrimp were over cooked they were real rubbery and hard to chew, my Cajun fries were hardly seasoned it looked like a splash of the seasoning was thrown on one spot only and the rest of the fries were plain, my girlfriends chicken tenders looked like they were battered and thrown in the microwave to heat up , they were so Mushy !! Another thing I noticed is they take forever to get a table cleaned up, at previous boiling crabs I've been too as soon as the guest leaves the waiters are on it and get the table cleaned up it takes them no more than 3-5 mins to get it cleaned and seat the next guest. These waiters it took them about 10 mins just to get started on cleaning a table, and there's no excuse to say it's because they're busy there was more than enough staff to help half of them were slacking around just walking around. I was really disappointed when I came here I was looking forward to it but came out home sick lol I'm never coming back here again and for those Los Angeles or South Bay residents If you've had boiling crab back home don't come here unless you want to leave disappointed! Waste of my money .....",

With a short, but sweet menu of boiled seafood and fried goodness, there is nothing less pretentious than being served hot plastic bags of food brought to you in buckets, rice in to-go containers and plastic utensils if needed. Being of the indecisive, yet I want to try everything, mind set, the \"whole she-bang\" of flavor choices seemed perfect and worked out well as the sauce in which the food arrived in. Flavorful and a bit spicy, the flavor penetrated the shells of the shrimp perfectly and left the meat tender.   Use your hands to eat everything and satisfy your need to break the heads off helpless creatures, tear meat away from shell and bask in the juices spraying everywhere as you destroy your meal. Hulk hungry!! Then discard the useless parts on the table just like you used to do at mom's. It's finger, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, chin, forehead-licking good.   Be prepared for scores of Asians dining here and only one moist towelette per guest brought with the check; perfect to wipe off the hand which opens the door to the bathroom to wash up for real. And what do Asians have to do with anything here? Nothing, just a keen observation. Great for everyone on a first date.",

Started with the half dozen oysters (which btw as I was ordering them my waitress let me know that they were down to the last 6 and cut me off mid sentence to run and get my order in which she did and I commend her for that) if I remember right her name was Michelle and she was so on point she definitely deserves recognition as well. I don't remember the last time I had such amazing service and on such a busy night she was magnificent. Now back to the food the oysters were bomb, the cocktail sauce that it came was had a kick of spice that was amazing and then we ordered a pound of shrimp and 2 pounds of Dungeness crab and we also got some corn and potatoes and the seasoning was life changing. We got the mix of all three of their seasonings with the 3rd spiciest option and it was absolute perfection. I will be stopping by here every time I come to Vegas from now on. Thank you for topping off my edc weekend with one of the best meals of my life.",

First time I tried BC it was in SoCal, instantly became a fan of the shrimp with the whole sha-bang sauce mild. So naturally when it opened in Vegas i was pretty excited. If you haven't already tried it, definitely try the catfish&fries, soooo good. All in all definitely a good place to eat, foods great, prices are okay, service is great, flat screens all around and its super spacious, unlike the the BC's in SoCal.

Anyways,  back to the food.  So my friends ordered a pound of shrimp and rice. I decided just to get the fried Calamari.   So the waiter took our ordered.  He was nice, good customer service until when the food arrives.   I gave it 3 stars out of 5 because I guess our waiter wrote on his note pad extra shrimp, extra fried calamari.   And the young lady server was getting kinda confused herself.  She keeps telling us, so no one ordered EXTRA fried calamari,  EXTRA pound shrimp?  And we looked at her and said, \"NO!\"  Not only that but after we were done eating my friends got charge extra for something that wasn't supposed too.  But for me, I was happy with my bill. lol.......",

The calamari was 100% better then Hot and juicy. The clams were awesome. The gumbo was good. And u think the sauce was better. However the shrimp were all different sizes and on the smaller side. I like em big and juicy so over all it needs much improvement. Oh and no bread. I actually was told by waiters people bring their own...... I went over to food for less and bought a French bread.

My mom and dad used to make crab and oysters and shrimp all the time and they would season with only Old Bay, lemon and salt and pepper, that seemed to have more flavor.The shrimp was either over cooked or just not good here.

When I came here for the first time, service was great and the food was fantastic, but when I came here yesterday, the greeter/hostess girl didn't tear us enough paper to cover the table for the four of us, so we had to cram our food into about 3/4 of the actual table space we had. Our waiter was phenomenal though, she came back to check on us a lot and was super friendly. All of us got a pound of shrimp and a random girl delivered our food, but we couldn't understand what she was saying because she slurred all of her words together so instead of \"a pound of shrimp, garlic sauce\", it sounded like \"apoundofshrimpgarlicsauce\" in a high-pitched annoying voice. We kept saying \"what\" because it was that bad. And half of my shrimps were crushed when I got them. I've had better experiences at Boiling Crab, wasn't impressed with last night's food.",

You know a place is good when people are lined up BEFORE the place opens. We got there at about 1155am on a Saturday & there was already about a dozen other people lined up to get in.  The staff was young & friendly from the get go & very informative about what everything was on the menu & it's description. The atmosphere is a mixture of picnic tables & sports bar tvs. A nice laid back environment where you can tag up the walls. Very cool atmosphere. The food is just as good! We got a pound of shrimp in 'the works' sauce which is a combo of 3 of their sauces. The spice of the shrimp is your selection, but apparently from the med to XXX is QUITE the jump. In addition to the shrimp we got sweet potato fries, Cajun fries (which you get a whole basket of), & fried calamari. I'd pass on the calamari as it is typically made bar food which I was pretty bummed about. Everything else was great! With all the food we ordered & a beer the total came out to $35. You def get your monies worth at this spot. Be prepared to make a mess, it's not for the light hearted that aren't into getting dirty.",

    "text": "Wasn't sure what to expect, but was very pleased with the entire dining experience.  I opted for the fried catfish based on recommendations, extra crispy, it was about as good as you can do catfish.  Fried just right, not greasy at all and 5 large pieces plus fries for $10 is a deal.  Decided to also try the gumbo with rice, added extra shrimp and sausage for .50cents more each.  Again I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's close to 16 oz of very good gumbo with ample portions of both shrimp and sausage, shrimp was cooked perfectly.  At $7 counting the add ons, this is another very good bargain.  I'll have to try the boiled seafood next time.  Prompt, friendly and attentive service in a clean establishment.  They're doing it right.",

Me and the bf usually go to hot n juicy if we crave some seafood but this time we were like lets go the boiling crab. So glad we didnt have to wait that long for lunch! It wasnt busy so we were seated right away and was told that they have no lobsters(sad) and clams that time. Our server was Mary Kay and she was really friendly and nice. She asked for our drinks and started our order. We got 6pc raw oysters, 2lbs shrimp cajun and garlic non spicy for the bf, and 1lb crawfish rajun mild for me and hot wings. We got sweet potato fries and rice as side dish. Everything tasted good... Altho My bf thought that the shrimp were a little over cooked... For me it was fine. I guess my taste buds are that easy! Lol. Will come back again but not for dinner coz im not a fan of waiting too long for a table..",

    "text": "It is a shame that we had to go all the way to Las Vegas to be able to eat at the Boiling Crab on a weekend night without having to wait 2+ hours to be seated.  In Los Angeles the Boiling Crab is crazy popular, and is always packed.  Apparently the Boiling Crab has not received the hype in Las Vegas that it has in Los Angeles.  However, I do feel that the hype is deserved because the food here is just that good!  We arrive to this Boiling Crab last Friday night after spending the whole afternoon driving from LA.  When we pulled up I jumped out of the car to put our group's name down on the wait list while the others parked.  I was shocked when I entered to find no line, and no one waiting.  I asked the hostess how long the wait was, and she told me \"10 minutes.\"  I responded in disbelief with an \"excuse me, did you say 10 minutes?!\"  After getting over the shock of there being no wait, I headed to the restroom since I had been sitting in a car for hours.  By the time I got back, my group was already seated!  I was AMAZED!  This Boiling Crab location has the same look as the other ones I have been to in LA, but is just bigger...MUCH bigger.  This probably contributes to the wait not being as long here.  The food was identical to what I have had at the LA locations.  Since I have loved the food at the Boiling Crab, I loved the food here as well.  My wife and I split orders of king crab legs, shrimp, sausage and potatoes.  We typically go with the THE WHOLE SHA-BANG seasoning with everything, but changed it up and had the Rajun Cajun with the shrimp, sausage and potatoes.  The Rajun Cajun was good, but it was no WHOLE SHA-BANG.  Truthfully, we just didn't want to overdo the garlic while we were in Vegas, but next time we will go back to what we typically order.  Eating at the Las Vegas Boiling Crab was the best experience I have ever had at a Boiling Crab.  Not having to wait or deal with pushy people waiting in line made dining here what eating out should be about, the food!  If I could, I would give this place more than 5 stars.  Since Yelp won't let me do that, I will say that this Boiling Crab is a must visit place if you are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Definitely worth the visit.   Came here on a whim because the wife wanted to compare it to hot and juicy.   Turns out it may just end up being my goto Cajon seafood joint.   The menu is eerily similar to hot n juicy,  except they round up to whole jumpers.   Makes eyeballing the bill a little easier I suppose.   The sauces they use are excellent -  medium has a ton of flavor but not overly spicy. Even though the sauce is probably still butter based it doesn't come off as greasy, seems like more powder ends up on your hands than butter.   Makes cleanup a little easier since they don't carry gloves..  Ended up with 4lbs of food - shrimp,  clams, snow crab legs, and crawfish.   All the seafood was insanely fresh, and nothing was soggy.   Crab legs were tight and juicy, made us want to order more.   But it was a ton of food as is.    Still trash bag covered table,  still served in plastic baggies,  but i really enjoyed the food.   Restaurant is a bit bigger and there are way more tvs to watch while you eat - plus it's cooler with all the overhead fans and ac on full blast.   Great for summertime seafood fun.   Wife says she still prefers hot n juicy, but it's full next time, we know a great alternative.",

    "text": "Last winter, my friends asked me if I wanted Boiling Crab and I was shocked to think that they'd go so far for it. Apparently, while I was away for college, a location sprouted up in Vegas as I enjoyed the shrimp from its SoCal counterparts. Right, duh, I knew that.  Fast forward about eight months later, we finally put on our bibs and started peeling shrimp. Got my usual order of one pound of shrimp with the whole shabang of seasonings and XXX for the heat. Perhaps my tolerance for heat and spices went up, but the XXX seemed really tame! I also love eating the chunks of cooked garlic in between preparing my next seafood sacrifice. Their Cajun fries are seasoned well like their marine friends, and their sweet potato fries also make great accompaniments.  Considering it was a late afternoon lunch and didn't seem that busy, I thought the service was lacking a bit. It took a while to flag down the waiter for water then the bill. I've had more attentive service at busier Boiling Crabs that were practically overflowing with people.   Overall, this is a 3.5 star review, with 3 for the service and 4 for the food.",

The food is always delicious, but this location gave, hands down THE best Boiling Crab experience I've ever had. We had a party of 23 on a Sunday evening (8/26/12) , so we were expecting even somewhat of a long wait...  We waited not even 5 minutes, we had our own secluded area toward the back the back of the restaurant, and the service was EXCEPTIONAL! Not once did anyone in our very large party have to ask for anything twice.  I wish I had gotten the name of our main server, as well as the other 2 who assisted him, but if the rest of the staff is as nice and on top of things as our server was, it would even be worth the wait.

    "text": "I've been wanting to try the boiling crab for so long and finally did this week. I'm from New York, and we don't have one on the east coast. This past Tuesday, I was in Vegas with my bf and parents, and decided to take a cab from Cosmo to the Boiling Crab. It was quick, only 10 minutes away.   Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a waiter and the smell of spicy goodness. We were seated in a booth near the window. We ordered 2 lb crawfish, 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb clams, 1 king crab, and 1 dungeoness crab all in the medium sha-bang flavor. It was so delicious and perfectly seasoned/spiced. We also ordered the catfish, which was so worth it for $10. All the food was washed down w/ bud lights.   After coming back to NY, I'm still thinking about how good the food was and cannot wait to go back to the west coast to have it again. Well done, boiling crab!  The only thing weird was this is a family environment and the music they were playing wasn't the most appropriate (Rihanna-Pour it up, Kendrick Lamar, etc). I didn't mind because I wasn't with any kids, but there were many tables that included families with young children.",

    "text": "I've always heard good things about TBC (The Boiling Crab) and I've also enjoyed my experience at TBC Honolulu, Hawaii. So the experience I had here this evening with my family was a big disappointment and we actually regretted spending our time and money here tonight.   Let's start with the restrooms, I'm a stickler for restroom hygiene...it's very important that not only is the facility clean, but also that it is well stocked! During our wait (1 hour wait) I went to the restroom to accompany someone and I just stood in the open space in front of the sinks, I noticed the floor was wet, there was a broken soap dispenser and no hand towels (only hand blowers! Gross! We all know that dispensers atomize germs). My cousin came out and told me the trash in the stall was full and there was trash on the ground too.   I went to the restroom a second time to wash my hands before dinner (15 minutes after the first time), the restroom was still in the same state.   The third time came after dinner which was probably an hour after getting seated...this time there was no soap left in the only working dispenser. My cousin's complained that there were no sanitary toilet covers and no toilet paper rolls in the stalls.  You would think that they would check the restroom every two hours or have a regular scheduled spot check for the restock of the restrooms. Obviously, they don't.   So that was pretty much my rant about the restrooms, the other disappointment came when they did not inform us that there were no disposable bibs and gloves for us to use. The bibs weren't too much of a problem since we were in casual attire. However, the gloves were important for my husband to have. He suffers from psoriasis and the skin on his hands crack from dryness, he has to constantly apply a medicinal cream to the skin on his hands. If the juices from the sauce or the food get into the cracks of his skin, it causes severe discomfort and stinging, also the cream should not be ingested. If he knew that there were no gloves, we would have chosen an entirely different place for dinner. Unfortunately, the servers said they don't have gloves and instead offered plastic bags. The bags were not practical substitutes for gloves as he wouldn't be able to pinch the legs off of the shrimp. This was very inconvenient. Also, when your party has to repeatedly ask for water that's usually not a good thing.  My husband was upset that he was not able to fully enjoy his meal and even more upset that I had to peel his seafood for him, since he wanted me to enjoy my meal too. I didn't mind peeling his seafood for him, but he insisted on speaking to the management to let them know about his experience.   In the end, the manager could only offer plastic bags. My husband was nice about it and didn't argue, but he made the manager aware that this upset him. I'd like to tell the manager to peel his 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of crab with those plastic bags within the same time frame that his family enjoys their meals. His family would surely be waiting around for him to finish.   Overall, we all agreed (10 adults) our experience was so dissatisfying that we would never waste our time and money here again.",

    "text": "***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 41/100***  Coming from California, The Boiling Crab franchise is a tried and tested brand for us, it is in our rotation of places we like to eat at. Yesterday was our very first time trying the Las Vegas location. I like how the place is very spacious but still has that Cali vibe, and that huge ceiling fan they had in the middle of the room made me giggle I didn't know why. Huge plus is not having to wait so long, I don't know if that was a fluke and that we were there before the dinner rush started but when you're used to having to wait at the very least 45 minutes in their CA locations, it was a welcome change for us.  Since we're creatures of habit, we tend to order the same things we like: Shrimp in mild sha-bang sauce ($11.99/Lb), Fried shrimp basket with Cajun fries ($10), chicken tender basket with lemon pepper fries ($7), Corn ($0.75/each), steamed rice ($2), sweet potato fries ($4) and instead of our normal Alaskan King crab legs we opted to try the Snow crab legs ($18/Lb)   Food was still good although I noticed the slight difference in the sauce, it wasn't as concentrated and didn't have pieces of garlic as the one in Cali. Service was a tad slow and our waitress only refilled our drinks once and never gave us lemons even after we settled our bill when we requested lemons to take that smell off your fingers that sticks even after you've washed your hands 3 times. I'm sure we'll be back when the mood strikes but there's so much places I'd rather try.",

    "text": "Loved the clams and the shrimp! Those were the best items I'd say. They served big chubby clams and not tiny ones. Loved how they give you a bunch of sliced limes so you can add some lime juice to our bags - don't add too much though because it can get sour. But overall the sauces are really good, super flavorful.   I also tried the King Crab - do not get this. This was just really bad. Crab legs weigh quite a lot, we only got 3 legs for the pound that we paid for. Worst part is, the legs and skinny and have no meat! The shells are so soft you can't even use the crab cracker to crack the legs open. This is a total waste of money. It's actually funny that the crab was the worst item considering the name of their restaurant. I sure hope it was just a one off kind of thing.  Adding corn to your bag is quite a rip off since it's just half of the corn and they charge like $1.50 for it, but its REALLY good! Mainly because its drenched in all the sauce and the flavor really sinks into the corn.  I didn't like how they didn't provide disposable gloves though.",

I had family in town and they said I had to try it. I walked in and the smell was so good I couldn't wait. Finally I ordered a pound of shrimp with 1/2 pound of sausage with flavor the whole she-bang with spiciness medium! I also ordered Cajun fries mild. What can I say soooooo good in flavor I love garlic and smell it and taste so good! I also dipped my fries in the sauce that came with the shrimp. Now that I know this place is so close and know how good this place is, I will be there more often. To top this off $60 for 3 of us is not bad. I ended up finishing my dinner with a couple Modelo's",

Every time the flavors are always the same. The service is always the same, friendly, nice, sweet, and attentive. The wait is also always the same, high waits almost every time you go. But thats why you go in when they first open, for early lunch! :)   Only down side is they do not have gloves for the guests. Sometimes my fingers will smell like TBC for a few days. Typically I use the lime wedges to help cancel the smell out. But gloves would def help! But beyond that getting down and dirty with some seafood is why I come here, we get a bib and watch a hockey game, or chow down. You can always add more, I am not a fan of the crawfish but that is just me! A lot of work for little reward! But the crabs, clams, shrimp, are all so good! I love coming here and its def a treat when I can get over to this side of town. And its WAYYY better than Hot N Juicy!",

The king crab was ridiculously expensive and they weren't even good. (1lb~$40) It was extremely salty and didn't even have much crabmeat. On the other side, the shrimp, the whole sha-bang, was pretty good. The fresh oysters were a bit sandy, but otherwise- not bad.   The wait for two was about 30 min at 8pm.

Depending on the season, they might be out of some menu items, but the alternatives are just as good! For the sauce, you can't go wrong with The Whole Sha-bang, which is a combination of the other sauces. I don't typically eat spicy, so I always go with the non-spicy option and it's still super flavorful. Try adding corn, sausage, and potatoes in your bag (you can also get it in a separate bag).  Thought they give you a bib, they don't give you gloves! So feel free to bring your own, as I do and it really makes clean-up a breeze (and also eating).",

For the sauce you have the option of choosing the original cajun sauce, garlic or a mix of both. You would then need to choose the level of spiciness for your order and whether you wanted to add any sides to it at an additional cost.   I had ordered 1lb king crab legs which came to be 3 legs along with my potatoes and corn. It was really good but definitely very messy to eat. I was totally stuffed after the 3 legs and couldnt even finish my potatoes or corn. We also got an order of wings on the side which I thought was only alright - will probably pass up on the wings next time.   Our server was also very nice and informative about the menu as it was our first time there. Would definitely revisit again if in the area!",

She made us feel rushed and seemed like she was forcing herself to crack a couple of un-genuine smiles.  The food on the other hand-- SO. GOOD. We decided on not going overboard since we needed to save some room for dessert from another venue so our order consisted of: 1/2 pound of shrimp with shebang sauce, corn on the cob, rice, and fried oysters. Surprisingly, our appetizer, the fried oysters, came to our table after the shrimp-- but no biggie. The fried oysters were fat, juicy, and battered to perfection. The shrimp was amazing as always.  Again, totally wish I could give this visit a 5-star, but the service was a real downer.",

The seafood here tastes super fresh and the prices are decent as well. I never had a bad experience with anything I've ordered and customer service is also always pretty on point. Overall a great place to come if you want to try seafood boil!",

    "text": "I love this place.  I've gone to the Boiling Crab jn California and this place is a million times better.  The service here is perfect.  All employees are friendly, courteous, and very attentive to your needs.    This restaurant is spacious.  After going through the front door you'll be in the waiting area with some space to your left and a larger space to the right.  A person at the podium greets you to seat you (given that there's no wait).  After passing the podium you'll see the main dining area out in the open with just tables (no booths) and to your left is the kitchen.  Surrounding the main dining area are a handful of booths.  There are a few tv's on the surrounding walls and by some booths for your entertainment.  Now, let's get to the delicious food.  My girlfriend and I ordered a pound of shrimp each, The Whole Shebang, XXX Spicy.  It was bomb.  We love spicy food and it just has the right amount of kick to it.  The sauce is so good it makes me drool just thinking about it while I write this review.  We also gor cajun fries, XXX Spicy.  My mouth is on fire.  They're spicy but so darn good!  The wait time can be long on the weekend and during weeknights, but I can assure you it's well worth it!",

We get there about 7 on a Monday and it was crowded like no other! We waited at least a half an hour for a table for two. Lots of big families there. You can tell this was the place to be. He ordered a pound of king crab legs and I ordered a pound of shrimp. You can only order by the pound for crab and 1/2 pound for shrimp. We received our dinner in a bag, literally from The Boiling Pot.   Our waiter, who unfortunately we can't remember his name, recommended we get all of the spices. It was very much worth it! The whole thing tasted wonderful and it provided a very good dinner that you had to work for. Everything is charged at market price and even though it's pricey, it's good seafood and the No-Frills atmosphere is giving you a good value. Everything was served in disposable containers so I'm assuming they don't have any dishwashing going on there. There was a family of at least 30 next to us and they left a huge mess that was promptly cleaned up by people throwing it all in giant trash cans. It was a great experience and a great Seafood fix!",

We actually waited around for about 20 minutes before we got seated. Not bad at all.   We ordered a lot of food, we just got back from driving from LA and were pretty hungry. We ordered a couple of pounds of shrimp, clams, potato, corn, and a crab. We received everything pretty quickly except for the crab. After about 45 minutes and the crab still didn't come out, we told the waiter to cancel the order. He was super apologetic about the wait and said that there was a hold up at the crab station in the kitchen, and then told us that it would be comped! The crab arrived a couple of minutes later and it was so good that we finished the whole thing! The waiter and the manager were super apologetic about the whole thing so that's a win in my book.",

So you  get your crab in a bag with a big bib. No plate no silverware except crab crackers.  Everything served in disposable containers with a large piece of white plastic covering the table. At the end of the meal two employees fold up the plastic sheet with everything inside. They bring out a trash can and everything is discarded no fuss no mess. Everything we ordered was great with the exception of cold French fries. Would definitely go back when I save up enough money.",

We share everything, but they only brought out one utensil for opening the crab legs. When I asked the waitress for a second one, I was surprised that she said we couldn't have an extra one due to \"company policy\". After we went home, I called the manager and he confirmed to me that this is their company policy that comes from \"higher up\".   You mean to tell me, we spent $81 for two people, and they can't give us an extra cheap plastic utensil? What's next, a policy of 1 napkin for 2 customers to share?   Unbelievable how greedy and penny pinching this company has become. Congratulations Boiling Crab, you have lost a customer for life over trying to save a few pennies for a plastic utensil.   Thank god for Hot and Juicy Crawfish down the street where we will go from now on whenever we have a seafood craving.",

I loved it so much that when I went back to Vegas, I tried to look for something similar -- and voila, Hot N Juicy Crawfish! NOW THEY'RE HERE IN VEGAS! Yeah, I was definitely stoked.  My server was extremely nice and friendly and if we needed something, all we had to do was flag him down. His name was Eric. I guess I'm pretty used to waving servers down now instead of waiting for them to come to you -- maybe it's an Asian-restaurant thing for me now... I was very judgmental of service, being a hotel major, but now I'm a little more lenient because of all these Asian restaurants I go to that I don't expect that much in service anymore. I'll call them if I need something.  Either way, this place was pretty empty (mind you, the place is like 3x the size of the socal ones I went to) so there was NO wait. I can't imagine there being a wait for awhile, though. The place was pretty staffed so I saw a few just standing there and looking bored. Based on the other reviews, I'm not sure how much training they've got.  My friend and I went this past Wednesday night and it was pretty excellent for us. No complaints at all and the food was good :). He liked it better than HNJ and I can't wait to try the Cajun flavor with the sweet potato fries on my next visit! :0D",

Okay, that's fine, lets order then! But communicate with each other and don't hound the guest when they are TRYING to order. First time visiting and they were out of almost all their crab options, minus the snow crab. So we got the snow crab and shrimp. Both were OKAY. As a huge seafood fan, the flavors left a lot to be desired and the size of the shrimp were pretty sad. Overall, do yourself a favor and just go to Hot n Juicy. Much better quality of seafood and the flavors are much better.",

The boiling crab is an amazing restaurant if you want that Vietnamese/cajun infusion of seafood..   get ready to get messy, everything is eaten by hand, there are no utensils.. ladies put your rings and jewelry away.. expect to have a mess when your done.. your hands will also smell like seafood for the rest of the day.. some people choose to wear gloves.. not a bad idea..  try it, you wont be disappointed",

I love it either non spicy or mild depending on what I feel and I get the \"whole shabang\" flavoring which is a mix of Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Sauce.  Today however, i wasn't feeling up to a pound of shrimp. As I am a fan of their Cajun fries as well, i decided to order their Fried Shrimp Basket. There was a basket of their tasty tasty cajun fries topped with fried shrimp, unfortunately 10, but perhaps you may request more by paying more? Will definitely ask next time. The Fried shrimp was just really good. I requested a mild spice on the shrimp and it was just perfect. I think i just found my favorite order here! lol  Once you walk in, you see a bunch of tables, to your left and right there's a waiting area, when you look further to the windows there are a nice amount of TV's and booths all along the windows about a step high. The furniture and the whole atmosphere kind of gives off a sense of what you think you may see inside a bar/lounge. Well that's how it would be for me at least.  Our waitress was nice, she checked up on us a couple of times, our group arrived at two different times and she came each time someone of our group arrived and got them their drinks. Unfortunately she left while we were just about to finish eating and we left the tip for him instead. But he was nice as well. But feel the tip should be the first waitress.  The shrimp is good, but a bit pricey. It's a place to go to hang out with friends, or to go out with friends one night to have some good shrimp. Good experience!",

So, I was delighted when we got to sit at a table right away.  \"The whole sha-bang\" buttery garlic heaven.  The only flavor on the menu.  They list other flavors, but I don't think anyone with working taste buds and brain would order anything else.  Shrimp, snow crab, sausage, corn, cajun fries, and fried calamari.  All freaking delicous.  Yes, eating is messy.  All table manners goes out the window, once you bite into your first shrimp or crawfish.  Totally worth going outside of the strip here.  Just don't wear a white t shirt!!",

Price range is not bad at all, service is normally fast which I really like. On good days I'll get really nice customer service! On some days though the host will take their time seating everyone when I clearly see open tables everywhere (like today) and today I was seated at a table that was really dirty like I mean there were napkins all over the floor on my side and it was all wet and gross. Only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star and not a 3 is Because our server was so sweet and apologized for the mess that was there and she even let us know when she was clocking out and who our new server would be and she was probably the best out of all the times I've been there. I wish I had gotten her name down but yeah 4 stars because of how considerate some of the employees are there unlike some other ones but I guess it can also be that this place is always crazy busy too",

Its very spacious with a lot of seating that includes tables and booths. They have tvs everywhere which is good especially during sports season.   The food is amazing! Well, the shrimp is anyway. I've only had the King crab here once, but me and my boyfriend soon realized we can get crab other places and have stuck with getting shrimp from there on out. We always get the whole sha-bang (mild on mine). I find the medium a little too spicy for my liking. You also have to get the cajun fries. The meal just isn't complete without the fries. Don't forget salt/pepper with lime! It takes the shrimp to a whole other level.  I love this place and will continue coming back time and time again.",

She's a spicy eater and the last place we gone to did not met her expectation. She was so pleased with their \"XXX\" Spice Level.   The staff members are friendly and normally only certain waiter or waitress served an area, but here, however, everybody help one another.   So getting helped was quick.   The food price is a little more than others, then again, the crawfish had a couple of big ones. Which is a plus!   Food was excellent , will be retuning.",

This place blows Joe's out of the water. Everything our group ordered was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed. The quality and freshness of the seafood is clearly evident. Also the variety of sauces available really turn up the flavor. I also love how uber casual the place is. Consider yourself forewarned: Do NOT wear your Sunday best to this place. Your seafood is served in a bag and you eat with your hands. So roll up your sleeves and prepare to get dirty.",

    "text": "Best seafood spot in Vegas,  hands down!!! I personally think that Boiling Crab is blowing hot n juicy completely out of the water.  High quality seafood in a super lay back atmosphere... whats not to love!!!  I have been here many, many times and the service was always great (unlike hot n juicy), I tried everything on the menu and there is not a single item that I didnt like!  The shrimps,  clams and crawfish are bigger than hot n juicy, you get more snow crab legs in your order and I think the sauce is better, more flavorfull and complex. Ask for extra juicy!  You get a free corn on cob with 2ibs of crawfish, I cant get enough of those sweet, spicy, chunky little creatures and their creamy delicious brains!!!  I can never decide which is my favorite between, dunjunness crab, snow or king crab. They are all awesome.  The lobster is the bomb too. So much to eat in one order, huge!!! Easily feed two persons.  I am also a big fan of their fried items: catfish, cajun fries, sweet potatoes fries even the chicken tender is a great item. I always ask for a side of sugar to put on my sweet potatoe fries... yum yum yum!!!  I came here last sunday (easter) and didnt had to wait to be seated. My niece learned how to peal her first shrimps, awwww I am so proud, she loves crustaceans as much as her auntie!  Also I never have to ask for an ice tea refill because the staff is always on top of their game.   Yelping about this place makes me hungry... I cant wait to come back asap!!!

    "text": "Aww my first Yelp review posted straight from the app. Let me make it a good one, at least I'll try.  I know this is called Boiling Crab but I'm not a fan of any crab that's been boiled so I'm probably not gonna try them. Now if BC had them steamed or grilled? I'd be all for it, something to ask about next time.  So a pound of shrimp is what I went with, all sauced up in the whole shebang with a side of sweet potato fries to soak up whatever sauce not on the shrimp. They were nicely sized and very delicious, add lime,some extra salt and pepper, and while you're at it more hot sauce. My mouth is watering right now. I usually don't like it when food is hot to touch and in a plastic bag but what's wrong with a little hint of plastic in your food once in a while. You can also go with other item like oysters which are raw, snow or blue crab which are boiled, fried shrimp which BC won't soak in sauce for you, etc and they're all at market priced I believe. You can also add potatoes and corn on the cob, yum. It smelt so good too.   One pound of seafood is plenty though I probably could've done another pound if I didn't drink so much, BC serves alcohol best thing to drink with spicy food. And it gets messy so don't wear nice clothes unless you're female, we like it when you dress nice but hate it when you complain about those sauce stains. Wear something nice that you wouldn't mind getting stains on.  The interior is pretty spacious and can easily accommodate larger parties. It has a beach, fishing, crabbing theme with many TV to watch a game, a large fan circling the ceiling, and if you really wanted to write on some of the walls and tables. Service is good but watch out for that auto-gratuity, I think it's on parties of 6 or more.  I am a big fan and want to go ASAP.  Aww damn it the app doesn't let you add reviews to lists.",

If your reading this and do not know what purging crawfish are your a newbie ha. It's where you put them in salt water to get rid of all the gunk that's in their vein on the back of the tail meat when you pop them open. I think the Vietnamese and mostly Asian way of cooking crawfish they neglect this step. If they put the extra work in and cleaned the crawfish out like this it would elevate this joint to 5 stars and probably the best place to get crawfish in this time zone that I have tried.",

To the OG in Orange County to Nor Cal's Sacramento location, and I must say, it is just as good as everyone says it is. Because of Boiling Crab, girls started noticing me more, I got a raise at my job, life just got better! What's their secret?   Can't go wrong with a pound of shrimp, whole shabang (it's all the flavors combined) and I go mild, because that's about a good kick without ruining my food. You know that song? The one that goes \"My milkshakes bring the boys to the yard\"? Well The Boiling Crab's shrimps brings the girls to the yard.   Feeling bougie? You can't go wrong with the King Crab legs, they're by order so the weight is gonna vary and it can a little pricey, but yo, these are off the chain! Hella meat! Dippin' it in that whole shabang saucey sauce! You gotta spend money to make money and the next day, I got that raise! Now I'm always gettin' the King Crab legs!   And service? Amazing service! Management is always so kind to me, asking me how I'm doing, if I'm enjoying myself, which I always am. I'm always greeted with a smile, what more could you ask for?

My buddy introduced me to Boiling Crab a couple of months ago and during my most recent trip, it was a no-brainer that I had to go again. If you've read any of the other reviews for this place, the seafood is obviously bonkers. Boiling Crab specializes in churning out boils not only for crab (duh), but a variety of our delicious crustacean and mollusk friends - shrimp, lobster, crawfish, clams, and oysters.  The interior combines the charm of a coastal seafood market (beach wood tables and benches, large chalkboard menu) with some unique original touches (graffiti clad walls, GIANT airplane propellers for ceiling fans). The space itself is HUGE. But even so, the waits can get lengthy during peak hours. To avoid the wait during my last visit, I came around 5:30pm on a weekday and was seated immediately.  The Sauce/Spiciness. Once you decide what seafood to order, you have to choose a sauce and heat level. For me, I have only tried the \"The Whole She-bang!\" which is a combination of all three sauces (Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic). You may be cynical, but TRUST me, this sauce is seafood ambrosia. The flavors go with everything on the menu. As for spiciness, I tend to prefer not to let too much spice overpower the flavor of the seafood, so I usually go mild (you'll still get a touch of heat).  During my latest visit, I had the clams ($10/lb), snow crabs ($18/lb), king crabs ($27/lb), and shrimp ($12/lb). The clams were great and just the right amount of tender. The ONLY slight slight slight criticism I had - which is why I'm not giving 5 stars - was the crab legs. Given the price I paid, I expected them to taste just a little bit fresher, and a couple legs were a tad overcooked. Don't get me wrong, they were still good, just not to my standards of what \"5 star\" crab legs should be. As for the shrimp (served shell on), they are my absolute favorite item on the menu. Not only were they the best bang for my buck at $12/lb while also having the best meat to shell ratio, the shrimp were cooked to perfection and pair perfectly with the Whole She-bang! sauce. So yes, you absolutely have to order the shrimp.  If you're a seafood junkie and are willing to venture a couple of miles off The Strip, this is the place to hit up. You will get a little messy and dirty (like most things Vegas), but it's damn worth it (unlike most things Vegas).",

Our server Amy was so helpful and always checked with our table to see how we were doing.  The fries, chicken wings, and fried oysters were BOMB. Everything tasted sooo good. The only down side, was the mild shrimp didn't have a lot of sauce which was expected. But overall, everything tasted delicious. Definitely coming back!",

I love the atmosphere and friendly workers. They all always look like they're having so much fun and most of the girls wear jean shorts and nike shoes. Just a little observation I took note of, lol.   It can get pretty busy but definitely worth the wait!  They have a lot of workers so expect to be helped fast and with a smile always!  I went with my boyfriend and his family and our server was Joey. He was super cool and really nice. He introduced himself to us right at the beginning and is very social and knows his menu for sure! Always checked up on us, made sure we were good, and got us taken care of quickly and efficiently. Our waters were constantly refilled and needs were fulfilled. I felt so needy but he never made us feel like it was too much to ask for. Excellent customer service!   The whole shabang shrimp mild (half pound) with a side of rice and cajun fries is my usual. SUCH a delicious meal. I am craving it right now as we speak! Their prices are very reasonable for how good their food is. I love putting limes to season my shrimp. Their mild cajun fries are just the right amount of spicy! And the side of rice is a good portion. I share half and half with someone usually because it's too much for me!  If you're down to get dirty and have a good time, this is definitely the place.",

    "text": "There are so many different Cajun places nowadays, but Boiling Crab will always be number one. Living in the Bay Area, the wait time is always 2+ hours. There was even a time where I was put on a \"no guarantee\" list - pretty much a list where you might not get to eat because it's so busy and they'll close.  As for the LV location, I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table. It's really spacious inside and the workers clear off tables for the next patrons quickly. Make sure your party is all present because they will not seat you if everyone is not there. When they said they count heads, they aren't kidding. Both tables and booths are available. If you're trying to get the best seats for the TV, it doesn't matter where you sit because there's TV's everywhere.   My typical order is usually a pound of shrimp, the whole sha-bang medium. If I'm really hungry, I'll add some corn and sausages too. An order of the Cajun fries is a must.  The servers are always attentive and quick. I don't think I've ever experienced bad customer service at Boiling crab. They might run out of some seafood items from time to time, but that's only if you're ordering live crawfish or crabs. No worries if you're just looking for shrimp. Off with their heads! Literally.",

I always get corn with my shrimp (why wouldnt you) and got it in the bag with the sauce and it was just amazing. The atmosphere was very casual, very chill. It's like being in a sport bags somewhere by a pier. It was great. Obviously, be prepared to be incredibly messy. The place is also great for large parties (we were a party of 10).

There was wait time about 25 minutes . The place looks clean and has interesting decorations. The waiters and waitress were pleasant and helpful. What disappointed me were the crab legs. Both the king crab legs and snow crab legs are mushy and not fresh and very bland. It reminds me of seafood being frozen for too long and lost its sweetness . The shrimp are quite tasty. Overall I'm quite disappointed. King crab legs At $34 a pound , it is not cheap and I felt I get much higher quality crab legs from grocery or from Costco .",

My hands were messy, I had tears in my eyes, a runny nose and I couldn't think straight. I had gotten lost in a shrimp eating frenzy like a mad man going in on the very thing that would eventually be the end of me. Occasionally, I would let my friend Louis take a hit of the XXX shrimp and he just couldn't hang. Haha he would immediately start to cough but he powered through. Our server seemed a little annoyed the whole time but maybe she was just having a long day. Bathrooms were a little messy but they had the jams going so I was cool. I left satisfied that night.",

You can't beat the prices they have and the shrimp seasoning is one of the best I've ever tried. All there locations are the same as busy so I always try to arrive an hour before I usually get hungry because this place is always packed.

H n J was originally started here in Vegas, but I decided to try The Boiling Crab based on their Yelp reviews. I was very pleased, but I likely would have been happy at H n J's too. If you like seafood, beer, and don't mind getting messy then it's hard to go wrong.  The restaurant is just a few miles from the Strip, but to a visitor this is a totally different view of Vegas. The restaurant is located in it's own busy \"strip\", an aging strip mall. The center is anchored by a grocery store and non-descript shops that you might find in any city. We may have been the only out-of-state customers who ventured over to this section of town. The clientele was primarily Asian and Hispanic.   We had a great experience. I ordered shrimp, snow crab legs, corn, and potatoes in the Whole Sha-bang sauce and medium heat. The seafood was cooked just right and the seasoning was great. I thought the seasoning was a bit saltier and less buttery than H n J's.  I missed out on ordering a bowl of rice, but that would have been perfect for extending the amazing Sha-bang. Service was excellent. The wait staff were all young people, and they were polite and friendly.",

A word to the wise you will need to dilute the cocktail sauce by at least half with catchup or after having spent your evening in a restaurant you spend your night in the restroom #Facts The steamship are OK as well the funny thing is we've gotten them almost every time we've gone and depending on when you go the day the time it should be mushy which is kind of strange for food that is supposedly prepared only to order. Our first time there are waitress was an utter dullar She spoke about how the kitchen was backed up and we should order early when we ordered somehow the kitchen that was so busy manage to send out food with him to be fresh from the freezer and not flash from the fryer. Joe is a great waiter he generally works there after four I suggest you ask for him by name he's pleasant and makes no bones about getting your order just the way you like it without any extra hassle for making you feel like it's an imposition because you like your food say cooked lightly or cooked thoroughly. Make a person the other seafood restaurant I said this place is pretty swell for an off the strict eating experience that's not gonna be overly pricey all in all I'll give it about 3 1/2 stars maybe four depending on the day.",

The food at Hot 'n Juicy is wayyy more flavorful and their customer service is outstanding compared to these people.   Here is why: We went to Boiling Crab last night to celebrate my little brother graduating, we were a party of 13 and 1 child needing a high chair. At check-in, we were told the wait time was 30-35 minutes; no big deal. 40 minutes later we check the status and was told we would get called in 5 minutes, another few minutes go by and the 'lead' hostess mentioned that if our group split to two tables near each other, we would get sat down quicker. We agreed however, I've sat separate at other restaurants before, but never a whole entry way away from the rest of the group. We had to yell or get up and walk to one another to communicate.  Our drink order had barely been taken when we noticed the staff putting tables together to accommodate another large party. We asked if we could be moved to that table now that it was ready. Again, our drink orders had barely been taken so we were sitting for less than 5 minutes before they started putting the tables together. Everyone from the hostess to the manager could not give us a clear answer as to why we could not move literally RIGHT BEHIND US besides that they had already told the other party they were going to be seated soon and that for the inconvenience they would RUSH our order out. No, we don't want our food rushed; we want our food cooked at the same length of time and with care as all the other patrons. Had that group been sat in a different part of the restaurant and we not seen them get sat together, no big deal but being you sat them right there was a huge slap in the face. But I will simply leave it at each of our large parties were not of the same racial group. Splitting a large party that far apart from one another shouldn't even be a question asked as if we come to celebrate or simply have a family dinner OF COURSE we want to sit together.   Food: overly greasy, not seasoned AT ALL soooo JUST GO TO HOT 'N JUICY, Urban Crawfish Station or any other similar place, but NOT HERE! I've been here 3 times over the course of years and the food has yet to get better! I will NOT BE BACK!   I hope this review saves another party of 2 or 52 people from being disappointed by the terrible customer service and food.",

I went with my hubby on a Monday night around 6pm and the wait was only about 10 mins! I am used to waiting over an hour for this place so a 10 min wait was awesome! We got seated and our waitress was so attentive and always checking on us. We ordered half a dozen of raw oysters... SO FRESH! Then we got a pound of crawfish $7.99 (not live/fresh) and shrimp ($11.99 fresh) whole shabang. The shrimp was delish and crawfish was ok since they weren't fresh but still flavorful! We had to have the cajun fries of course and they were fried perfectly and seasoned with cajun spice. We also ordered the cajun chicken wings which were a big disappointment since they were pretty much over fried and burnt. That was the only reason for me giving them 4 stars. I always get wings from there and they are always good but not so much here. I just didn't understand why they would even serve burnt wings. Oh well! We ate everything else and were satisfied! Can't wait to come back for some fresh crawfish!",

Prices  are in line for fresh seafood. Their are a few ways to order but not many non fish choices. Prep choices are kind of limited on how the crab etc are prepared so you have to get used to that. The crabs come served in a plastic bag smothered in your spice choices. When you eat it is messy and so be prepared to get sticky. If you like good crab this is a place to try. The hours are a little later so no early lunch here.",

I think the flavors here are a bit more flavorful than Hot N Juicy, but both places are good in my book.  Crawfish is a nice size esp for the time of season I went. I was shocked that they were as big as they were. The corn that comes in the bag is so sweet, but be careful though, bc if you ordered the spicy crawfish, your mouth will burn from the seasoning that rubbed on the corn. Also, the shrimps are nice and big too. If you want a lot of meat with less work then crawfish, then shrimp is your way to go, but I prefer crawfish.  Can't wait to come back. I want a crawfish place like this up in Philly. Too bad the only places that carry an abundance of crawfish is at chinese buffets and they aren't as flavorful.",

    "text": "When I say I'm a huge fan, I mean that I create cooler environments! LOL Totally kidding because compared to Boiling Crab, Hot & Juicy seems Tasteless & Dry! Now, that might be a cause of offense to some people, but in my preference, which I will elaborate on, would be the service and environment of BC! Since it's been established in Las Vegas, they've always been busy! The first time I've had BC was in LA and I told friends from Vegas about it and they told me about H&J! Ever since I've had BC, I've never been back to H&J!  BC has similar food items like H&J! They have the Cajun style seafood with your shrimps, your crawfish, lobster, crab legs, cajun fries and they tailor to your tolerance of spicy! If you're like me, I'm good with ZERO spicy because even medium is spicy for me! Friends who've preferred the Cajun spice to their food have said it isn't spicy at all! Do I know how True that is? No! Will I ever test how hot their spices are? Probably not! If you know the movie starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, Along Came Polly, you'll know exactly what spicy food does to me! LOL!  But the reason I give BC a 4-star rating is for the other items on their menu! The fried catfish and cajun fries are TO... DIE... FOR! I ask for extra tartar sauce for extra dipping, limes to drench it in it's juice, and if a friend is kind enough to let u dip some catfish in their Whole Shebang sauce, give them a big hug and be sure to have a few mints on deck cuz the smell of your burps and breath will kick like a mule! More like a pack of mules! They give 4 or 5 HUGE catfish filets along with a medium sized basket of fries (regular and sweet potato fries are also available!). Another addition to BC's already awesome menu is their fried oysters! I'm a huge raw oyster fan, but the fried oysters are just as good!  Will I ever come back to BC? Of course I will! Throw another shrimp on the bobby! And some catfish. And some oysters. Annnnnd some crab legs. :) Happy eating!",

A friend of mine told me I was about to get messy with my food.  Which honestly, didn't seem fun....;  But little did I know...  Food - It was delicious. So I had to eat with my hands and get the sauce all over them.  A little weird at first but I got over it once I tasted the sauce.  The shrimp was wonderful.  I also had the fried catfish with fries which was scrumptious.    Atmosphere - Very lively.  Also they had TVs everywhere so I may come by for the games every once in a while.  Service - Our server David was very sweet and attentive.  He knew it was my first time so he explained how the menu worked and guided me through out.  He's also very cute and charming.  You can say I have a little crush on him  Price - Seems very affordable.  I recently went to Hot N Juicy, which is pretty much the same style restaurant and their prices are a tad bit higher.    If I had to pick between Boiling Crab and Hot N Juicy.  I'd pick Boiling Crab in a heart beat.    5 Stars - Will be back!!!",

I've given you three reasons why you should eat here, certainly one of them has to be relevant to you!  Recommendation: for first timers , I recommend ordering your seafood of choice with the \"whole shabang\" sauce option. This is a mix of lemon pepper, their Rajun Cajun Sauce, and garlic butter. Trust me, you will not regret this decision. Also, if you decide to order shrimp keep in mind you can also order by the half pound.",

Tackling 5+ pounds of crayfish alone you will need backup and lubricant. You're welcome.",

    "text": "The Boiling Crab is a good place to go if you want to wear a plastic bib with a picture of a large crab on it while you eat with your hands and smell like garlic when you leave--we love it!  The first time I ate at BC was in LA with my little brother, where we got in line with about 20 other people half an hour before they opened on a Friday afternoon--popular!  That hasn't been the case so far at this Decatur location, but we usually arrive around 5:30 to beat the crowds who do show up by the time we're leaving.    Eating here is fairly straightforward: -pick your seafood and order by the pound:  shrimp, crawfish, oysters, clams, lobster, blue crab, king crab legs, snow crab legs, and Dungeness crab are your choices.  Your server will inform you up front if they are out of anything that day. -pick your sauce:  Rajun Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce, or the Whole Sha-Bang, which is a combo of all three sauces. -pick your spice level:  non-spicy, mild, medium, and XXX.   Fried options include catfish, shrimp, chicken tenders, calamari, oysters, and hot wings. Sides are gumbo, Cajun chowder, corn on the cob, potatoes, sausages, Cajun fries, lemon pepper fries, sweet potato fries, steamed rice. (Yes, I just summarized the menu.)  I usually get a pound of shrimp with mild Whole Sha-bang sauce, steamed rice, and a corn on the cob.  This past visit, we also had sweet potato fries first.  My method of eating shrimp is to peel a bunch first, then eat with rice, peel another bunch, eat, repeat, until all the shrimp is gone, my hands are red from the Sha-bang sauce, and the table is a disaster area.  What's so great about this place is that there are always so many other Asians there, mainly Filipinos from what I saw the last time; it feels like I'm at a family party.  Any opportunity that we get to eat rice and seafood with our hands is a good one, apparently.  There are TVs everywhere, so you can watch a good game or ESPN while you nosh.  This is a great place to go with friends and dig into your food.  Just don't wear white.",

So yes, it was about a 45 min wait, it was a Friday night, and the place is packed.  People are outside waiting.  So we finally got our table, the waiter was a little pushy to me.  He went over everything so fast, and we were virgins to this whole concept.  So we told him we needed more time.  Seems like he just went 1 table over, then came right back!  DUDE!  give us some time.  So I think he took about 5 to 8 min, then he was back!  So we chose our food, I got the king cab legs, cajun style, hot!  and every one else ordered craw fish, and shrimp (I wasn't interested in what they had)  So my crab finally came it was big, seasoned, and messy!  It had a nice kick to it, and boi, did I get some huge chucks of crab.  OMG I was in heaven!  Once I was done, I really wasn't done!  I wanted another order.  It didn't seem like I got as much the second time as I did the first time but the same price!  (Side eye)  Never the less it was the best.   The waiter kept checking on us.  This place is fabulous!  When I'm ready to get my crab on, this is where I will be going!",

I will always come here just because of the King Crab Legs and before today not so much for the service because I always thought it was horrible. Today, my experience was completely turned around.   I came in with my husband and family, and forewarned them that the service was horrible but the food was undeniable.  Our server, Christian was all smiles greeting our table with a personality on him that could brighten the whole restaurant. He was extremely professional, asking if we were all on one or separate checks. He took our drink order immediately and delivered them quickly. As soon as he came back with the drinks, it was right down to business taking the order. He repeated our order and made sure it was correct, and quickly entered it into the computer. He even came back to let us know that the order was in and should be out shorty!!! He was just incredible!!  I have always been loyal to the boiling crab, but never crazy about the service. Today, changed everything. Christian is definitely an asset to your company and brand. There should be more servers like him.   Thank you Christian!!",

I wouldve eaten at the restaurant , but I didnt want to  wait and lets face it eating at home where you don't have to wear pants is much better.  I called to  place my  order while on  the way  home and was told about 15 minutes.  i got there exactly in that amount of time and it was ready. Perfect! They  also threw in some extra  dipping sauces for me as well which is a plus. Life is much better with extra sauce. I ordered a fried shrimp basket  with an extra fry  sauce and an ear of corn in a bag of hot and juicy  medium sauce. The total came to  about $14. Kind of pricey for to-go , but the food tasted amazing and the staff was really nice. The flavors and cajun spice was on point as always and they  did NOT skimp on the shrimp in my  basket. I was able to  save the rest for later. I need to  stop  forgetting about this place.",

Place is big and we didn't have to wait for a table (both times, we went during off hours).  We came with friends and ordered tons of crawfish and shrimp. We ordered some medium and some spicy. OMG, the spicy is...SPICY! I can handle a good amount of heat and I'm so glad a restaurant know's what spicy means. It was so good! Even the medium has a nice Kick to it. Sauce was lick my fingers good, but doing too much licking kinda burnt a hole in my tongue. HAHAHA. The corn that comes with the crawfish is also quite delicious (sweet and spicy flavor). So fresh too! If you want something to help drown some of the heat, order white rice. That's what I did, and so glad I did.  Overall: I want to just fly out to Vegas just to come here! Hot n Juicy is good, but nothing compared to Boiling Crab.",

It wasn't packed but there were definitely a good amount of people.   First thing I noticed when I walked in was all the TVs. TVs everywhere. It would have been perfect if we came when there was a game on.  We had a nice server and his name was David. We decided on 1 lb of shrimp mild, the whole shabang, and my boyfriend and I each got the catfish basket which came with Cajun fries.  When they brought out the food, I noticed that there were no plates for the shrimps and no utensils. We asked one of the guys there and he said they don't have plates and they only have plastic forks and knives. I wanted the fork to eat my catfish. I'm not used to eating with my hands.  The catfish was good, perfectly prepared, and the fries were yummy.  The shrimps came unpeeled and I had a very hard time peeling them. My wonderful boyfriend ended up peeling them for me but between the both of us, we probably only ate half the shrimps. We ended up taking the rest home.  I will definitely return when I have family in town. There's not a location in Massachusetts and I think my parents would really enjoy this place.",

Especially when it comes to seafood served in a bag and eating with your hands like a Filipino FOB (if you know what that means), the Boiling Crab is a best place of its kind!   First, you choose your seafood. Second, how many pounds. Third, you choose the flavor. Lastly, you order some yummy cajun fries, squirt ketchup all over your newly papered table--then they tie a 'baby bib' around your neck and you are seriously READY to make a big big mess on your table!   But usually, since I don't like to always look like some crazy food addict, I call in my order to-go and pick it up so that I can just eat like a lunatic in my own home. Or you call your family members and make the mess at their house ;)  My favorite thing to do is order a pound of shrimp or crab or crawfish (if you like it) in the Whole Shebang sauce and call it a night! Also, when I eat in the restaurant, me and my cousin like to order fresh oysters--which are super yummy and not dirty tasting here!  After you are done, your stomach will be thanking you.   P.S. If you noticed that your breath has changed overnight, it might (a) make your coworkers jealous that you ate like a king/queen yesterday and/or (b) require several serious hours of eating mints, brushing your teeth, and using mouthwash!  Goood luck and happy eating :)",

But that's your bad, why you tryna go to a place that everyone loves during one of the peak hours of eating?   I rolled in here last week on a Tuesday with a party of 40 for my 30th birthday. The service was great. The only problem was that we ordered way too much food. Thanks for the heads up, servers! Alright that isn't their bad, we were all just \"eating with our eyes\" aka \"takaw tingin\" as it's said in Tagalog.   Anyone who works there reading this review might be like, damn, this guy tryna make more parties of 40 come to our place! That's my bad, but c'mon, y'all do a great job. Double edged sword. I don't think they're getting many huge parties at the other crawfish-spicy-crab-juicy-creole-kickin-place in the area.   Roll through this place. It's super huge, so you realistically probably won't even have to wait that long. Just remember, when you order 2 pounds of shrimp... for yourself, you can realistically add at least 1.5 pounds to your exit weight. Keep that in mind.",

YAYEAH!!!....but sadly the Vegas location didn't live up to the California locations level. IT was a dead afternoon. About 5 servers for 4 or 5 tables, but it seemed like the servers seemed to be in a not-working mode, will take forever to check back. the food was OK but not superb or addicting like when i had it over there. Seasoning was lacking. It seemed like you were eating plain boiled seafood(clams & shrimp) the fries were still delicious as always...but skip this place and drive up to HOT N JUICY. You wont be disappointed there.  Sadly Boiling Crab is out of my cravings list. Maybe when i visit LA ill be back to it.",

    "text": "I decided to eat here with my gf because we wanted to see what the alternative to Hot & Juicy had to offer. But we had to wait because they don't open until 3pm, which sucks if you're part of the lunch crowd.   They've got a much bigger, better location here. It's spacious, with lots of booth and table seating spread out. We got a booth and they put down a large sheet of butcher paper to protect the table during the meal.   I didn't want to overeat like I always do, so we ordered a pound of shrimp - with the \"all of the above\" seasoning with mild spice - along with an order of corn and 2 orders of red potatoes. Since we were starving, I broke tradition and got an appetizer of the gumbo with rice.   Gumbo was good, nothing that blew me away. Definitely get it with the rice because it's pretty soupy even with it. Good flavors, a decent amount of shrimp and sausage, but I wouldn't necessarily order it again.   The shrimp came out with all the goodies in the bag. Corn tastes amazing after it's been soaking in there for a while. Our shrimp were hot & tasty. I think I like Hot & Juicy's seasoning mix a little more - I recall it being a bit more flavorful and savory, but this is just as good.   I like to cut my potatoes open at the art of the meal so they can cool off a bit, then I dunk the halves into the juices at the bottom of the bag. This is extremely delicious and I recommend you do the same.   Our server was great, made sure we were well tended to since once you start eating your hands will likely be covered in tasty juices. Unless you bitch out and wear gloves while you eat. Please don't so that; it makes you look weird. Man (or woman) up and eat it like you're supposed to.",

Similar to you taking a piece of shrimp and adding cheap oily hot sauce to it.  The seafood itself was good quality but you're eating pretty much boiled seafood so the sauce is important.  I really didn't see the appeal.  I was surprised it was so packed and crowded.  We waited for an hour.  I love seafood but I was just not impressed.  I've been to New Orleans twice and New York 3 times.  There's no competition.  Maybe I was expecting too much.   They don't give you gloves or handy wipes either.  Customer service was very nice.  It's probably just me.    I recommend The Boil in NYC, Chinatown instead.  That sauce is amazing that you will want to drink it and lick every last bit.  It is mind blowing.  Very similar concept as The Boiling Crab but at a different level in regards to taste and quality. Also, they give you gloves and handy wipes.",

    "text": "Nearly everything about this place is perfection. Wide open space with plenty of seats, friendly wait staff, the freshest and most well seasoned seafood I have ever tasted, reasonably priced, and free limes!  I've been to a handful of cajun seafood places before, and this is by far my favorite establishment. The food came out shockingly quick, (5-10 minutes?) and everything tasted amazing. I also loved the fact that they give you free limes and salt and pepper seasonings on the side. I've never seen this at any other establishment.  The raw oysters are the freshest and most delicious raw oysters I have ever slurped up. I didn't taste any sediment, and the oyster went down so smooth with no excessive fishy smell/taste. The shrimp was very plump, fresh, and delectable. I got it in the spiciest whole shebang sauce and it surely satisfied my seafood cravings. I almost got a spicy level below, but I'm glad I got the spiciest XXX level. If you love spicy food, and can handle nearly thai hot, but not quite there yet, or even spicier, then trust me, go for the XXX level!  The crawfish was very succulent and fresh and the sweet potato fries are a must order! these are so addicting and perfectly fried and seasoned. I'll admit, I could probably eat a whole basket by myself!  The Fried shrimp basket was not bad, but could be seasoned a bit better and battered a bit differently to make it crispier, however still tasty. The cajun fries that accompanied the shrimp in this basket again, could have been seasoned a bit better but were still tasty.  This is definitely going to be my first stop whenever I visit the west coast again! I love this place! The waitress was also very easy going and friendly about splitting our checks between 6 people!",

I've been in a seafood funk since last Summer's visit to Florida, and while I've tried a few places around town, nothing has really gotten my seafood-based energy going. This place? This place is good times.  A lot of great food and seasonings, the service is very well done, funny, and helpful. From the moment they toss limes and little tubs of salt on the table, they know things are going to get messy, and line the tables with paper, and bibs for the customers. Food demolition is imminent, and I felt slovenly and decadent all at once.  Their gumbo is great, as is their other gumbo variant with the tomato bisque style sauce. Full of various seafoods and flavors. Everything was good, but I probably could ruin plates of oysters all day. Fortunately, everything was very fresh.  Busy times vary. The first time we walked in, it was simply just that: We walked in. We tried again a week later, only to find lines out the door.  We went back the next day only to find a smaller, more manageable line, and the restaurant filled up instantly within minutes of us sitting down.  Once you're in, you're golden. I'm still trying to figure out when \"busy\" time is for them.  The only thing they were missing was an ocean view, which I suppose I could forgive them, unless they want to hire people in dolphin costumes to frolic outside the windows, in which I will totally forgive them. The food's too good for the scenery outside.  Great food and service, crazy busy times, and needs and ocean view. I will visit here again, and keep doing so.",

They are usually young and look like it's their first job...  Although I must say over the past couple years the customer service overall has improved. We always order the snow crab, fried catfish & side of corn in butter.   A couple times the crab was slightly overcooked,  the catfish is always satisfying, and only once did the corn taste like it sat in a pot since the day before.  That's not too bad considering how many times we frequent this place, at least once a month, sometimes twice. The reason we come here and stopped going to hot n juicy is because of the atmosphere... It's simply way more comfortable, especially with young children in tow.",

I was 100% sure that this was one of the cases in which people brought my expectations up too high and I would be disappointed in the actual product.  I. Was. Wrong. Service was quick - employees were all young, energetic, and on point. Tables were lined with wax (?) paper to avoid any mess and allow for quick cleaning. Decor was unique and beachy with lots of wood features.  I got a pound of shrimp with potatoes in medium lemon garlic sauce. The sauce is so amazing...I just can't. Upon request, they give you salt, pepper, and lime, to make your seafood taste even better! I also tasted the whole shabang sauce and corn, which was just deliciously delicious deliciousness. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh as well.  Water came in plastic to-go cups, which is awesome because I reuse them for smoothies at home. The atmosphere is loud and lively in the restaurant, with many large parties.  Since I'm a big fan of crawfish, I'll probably go back and try it in the very near future.",

We also ask for the lemon and salt/pepper as an extra dipping sauce.   Sides: Corn is love. I always get at least two corns. I also order a side of rice because the sauce with rice is amazing.   Cajun Fries: Great spices! Great choice if you love fries as much as I do.   Service: Pretty inconsistent. It's hard to get a hold of someone. Most recently, it took forever for us to get our check. I would say their service has the biggest room for improvement.   If your friends aren't friends of shellfish, the fried catfish is also pretty good.

The spice level is spot on how my waitress described it. The clams were so delicious, they may have been the best I have had. We also got lobster, yum, cooked perfectly! My daughter loved her shrimp and the sausage. Everything was perfect and our server was super helpful and attentive!  The only negative thing I can say is when I ordered my lobster, it would have been nice to have the server actually share this information with me before hand, my lobster was a nearly 4 pound monster!! So beware of ordering and be mistaken on the price. The lobsters are huge. Still it's too good to take away a star for this. Can't wait to go back and probably still order the lobster. My husband is also driving me crazy, every time I ask him what he wants to eat he says The Boiling Crab, it used to be Hot and Juicy Crawfish.",

Similar to the first place in town that had a similar setup was Hot N Juicy. They were mostly crawfish and their seasoning was more cajun based. TBC is simplified. Choose your weight. Choose your flavors: Garlic, Lemon Pepper, a few other flavors and then you can get everything as they call it \"The Whole Shabang\". Choose your heat Level: Mild, Medium, Hot. My go-to is 1 pound Garlic Mild shrimp w/ a \"thing\" of rice. I say thing bc I don't know how they measure that lol. We ask for lime, salt & pepper packs to dip our shrimp in. Their crawfish is ok. my desire for crawfish has lessened over the years, not specifically at this location but in general. When I order a pound of crawfish, the only meat you get is in the tail and it seems like there's more weight in the head (I don't ingest the juice from the head) so I either need to order more crawfish or I leave hungry. This is why I tend to opt for the shrimp.   We've been coming here for years and we come here at least a couple times a month. Even though I grew up eating w/ my hands a few times a week, the shrimp/garlic smell just lingers and that's just not my favorite part of the aftermath of eating here! Not their fault but just saying, can't eat here every night!  TIP: Learned from my Mama, take the lime/lemon w/ you to the restroom and use it to clean your paws. Dig your nails into it, rub it all over your hands then wash w/ soap, rinse and I usually repeat bc I know how bad the smell sticks!   Will return.",

    "text": "Huge fan of boiling crab for the last 12 years.  I have driven over 50 miles before to get to a boiling crab.  However, this one in Las Vegas did not live up to my previous experiences with Boiling Crab.  What bothered me most was that they are a bit stingy, they charge premium prices for your food and they charge extra for anything else you want.  I ordered calamari and a pound of shrimp with sausage.  I asked for both cocktail and tartar sauce, the waitress brings one of each, when I asked for more she informs me that's all I get with what I ordered, any more are 25 cents each.  I just ordered 29.00 of food for just myself.  When the bill came they charged us for each and every cocktail sauce that we got, apparently none come with your meal.  The calamari was marginal at best.   The shrimp was great, other than the sour taste in my mouth from getting dinged a quarter for each cocktail sauce we had.  I probably won't be back to this one ever again.  I will be going to hot and juicy crawfish instead.  There are a handful of those here in Vegas, similar menu and much more customer service oriented.  Incredibly disappointed in what used to be my go to restaurant for shrimp. :(",

The shrimp were not cleaned properly, they still had the \"vein\" in it so that interferes with the flavor and speaking of, perhaps I should have gonna the mild because perhaps it would have give them seafood more flavor. The flavor was just ok, with the shrimp honestly the vein was really getting in the way of the flavor the crab was fine. The shrimp were too mushy for my liking the best part of the meal was the corn I give the corn 5 stars.",

BAM, it's like a flavor explosion in my mouth! If I'm super hungry, mussels or sausage are a good option as well.  The only thing I'll say is sometimes the shrimp is inconsistent. Sometimes it's small, sometimes it's big, sometimes it's over cooked and hard to peel, but it's not a big deal.   Service here is pretty good.

The seafood, service and atmosphere of this restaurant is A1.   I recommend the 1/2 or 2 lb shrimp with the whole shabang sauce with an order of potatoes or corn inside the bag! Those side items really soak up the sauce and makes my whole meal just come together perfectly. I get the medium sauce because I like to get a little kick when I'm eating my seafood.

Order your food, get it in a plastic bag, no plate you actually eat from the plastic bag with your fingers, and you leave all your trash on the paper table cloth. The price for the shrimps and crabs are by weight which sounds pretty fair. French fries came in a basket so as civilized people we left our trash in the baskets and nothing on the table cloth; we felt better this way ! One ordered shrimps with garlic lemon and really liked it. Others had the king crab legs. We were amazed how much meat you got into those legs. Very well done, cooked to perfection.

Otherwise, you're seated pretty quickly and orders are taken asap if you know exactly what you want before you're even seated.

I usually order a pound of shrimp (whole shabang, medium), rice, and maybe fries. Their shrimp is pretty consistent; although, I have had it over cooked. I get their sauce with less garlic & more lemon pepper. It's sooooo good!! & you put the sauce on the rice... mm, dead. Their fries are always crispy & good! I've tried their crawfish & crab & those weren't bad either. Just really great seafood!   The service is also pretty awesome. There's only been maybe once or twice that the service was subpar & im giving those people the benefit of the doubt lol. But anyway, this place is a must try!! If I can have boiling crab everyday... I would (The most I've done is 3 days in a row... LOL don't judge me).",

Im so used to asking for gloves and lemon which is something Boiling Crab does not have, instead they serve lime.

My dad's seafood palate includes the above and straight-from-the-tank or -sea in Hong Kong.   So in my short Las Vegas trip, all my dad wanted to eat were oysters and crab. The gushing reviews convinced me to take him here. Less than an hour later, my dad and his wife are eating leftover salmon and rice to make up for a tasteless dinner, while I suffer from daughter guilt.   The oysters had been previously frozen and defrosted into tasteless oyster-shaped coagulant. The snow crab legs, he and his wife said, were flavorless (despite the garlic sauce dip). The Husband went full fried with oysters, fries and soft shell crab, all of which were middling.  On the upside, we had a great waiter, people were happy to be there, and there are multiple TV screens to distract you from the disappointment that's on the table. Maybe TBC didn't have fresh food ready for a Friday on a three-day holiday weekend. You can come up with the excuses for us.",

We got everything in the sha-bang everything sauce medium spicy. We came hungry so we finished everything perfectly fine. Everything was fresh, and we had enough sauces to dip galore. Hot tip: pour some of the sauce from the bag into the rice - amazing!! Our server Mariah was also super efficient, always refilling our waters, got our order perfectly and was patient to explain everything as this was our first time here. Definitely recommend, worth the hour wait. Come here instead of one of the seafood buffets on the strip, it's way better!",

Side note: If you are worried about long wait times to eat here, do not fret.. this season is the perfect time to go!  Walked in and had no troubles waiting for a table and was sat right away. Laid down their signature table cover and was handed our big baby bibs.   This was our order: 2 Fried Catfish baskets - (4/5) would have been a full five stars if they were hot. Our friends said their basket felt \"warm\" not \"hot\" usually an indicator that the basket was sitting in the window for some time rather than being served immediately. But no MAJOR issue, will delicious & the fries were still delicious as always. 1.5 lb Shrimp, Whole Shebang flavor Mild - (5/5) Can't go wrong with the shrimp. Bag was steaming when we opened it & tasted so juicy & delicious! 1/2 lb sausage, whole shebang flavor mild - (5/5) I, PERSONALLY, wasn't a fan of the sausage because it was too salty for my liking especially w/ the sauce.. but aside from that everyone else at our table ate it up. The server asked if we would like the sausage and shrimp to be separate, which we did.. but there's also an option to put it in the same bag as the shrimp. 3 corn in butter - (5/5) Also have the option to mix it with your seafood or have it separate, and also can do any of the house sauces with the corn. Corn was sweet and a good palette cleanser from all the flavors. 1 lb of mussels, whole shebang sauce mild - This was probably the highlight of the meal! Haven't had mussels here & wow, the sauce and mussels was so good. Props to our friend for recommending it. Wouldn't have ordered it otherwise!   Typical sides: Rice, tartar sauce & ketchup for the fried baskets, & something I never thought of: salt & pepper with lime. Maybe I'm a newbie at this but, ask the server for this & they'll bring out salt & pepper in containers with limes. Squeeze the juice of the limes into the sauce containers & dip your seafood. So good!  Overall, it was such a great experience having Boiling Crab again especially without a long wait time, quick service & hot, delicious food.",

Efficient pricing for the food. The wait for seating may take long if they're really busy. If they aren't, probably like a 5-20 min wait. Overall good experiences so far. But last night I went over here to get some take out. First, for some reason, my call wouldn't go through. I called like 5 times. I assumed their phone doesn't work or my reception was bad. So I just decided to go there to place my order. When I went in, it was loud but that was usual so it didn't matter to me. I placed my order and waited about 10-15 mins and my food was ready. When I arrived home, i realized the shrimp was over cooked & the girl had misheard me. She placed an order of 1.5 lbs when it should've been 0.5 lbs of shrimp. Maybe they should turn down the music just a bit. But it explained why the bill was higher than I thought.",

The one difference for the one here in Vegas is that there really is no wait (at least for the couple of times that I have been there). The Boiling Crab is a lot bigger than the ones in Southern California and now have a huge wall of tvs that will be great to watch any sporting event, especially once football season starts.   You must get the whole shabang sauce (basically extra butter, garlic and spices) to marinate your selection of seafood. You can select how spicy you like, I usually get medium so I can still taste the seafood flavor of the shrimp and king crab legs. I am not a huge fan of crawfish so I usually don't order that. Other things that are must orders include corn and sausage (added to your shrimp), a side of rice to eat with the sauce, some fresh oysters to start, and maybe a fried fish basket with cajun fries.   Overall, a great place to hang out with your friends, eat some great cajun seafood, grab some beers and watch some sporting events.",

The food came out right away. Of course, we ordered crawfish, shrimp, fries, crab legs, and crabs. The sauce was not too overwhelming, which is a plus. Great place for large group to eat and chill.",

    "text": "Came here around 6pm with a party of four to celebrate birthdays: mine and my boyfriend's dad's. I often frequent the Alhambra and Garden Groove locations in SoCal so I was pleasantly surprised when I was promptly seated on a Saturday night.   This location is spacious with both booths and tables. Even when we left, there was only one party waiting. Last week in LA, my friends came around the same time on a week night and we easily waited an hour. Wait time is my biggest obstacle between me and my crawfish. The service was great. In LA, the servers just seem a little more frazzled.   Last summer, I tried Hot N Juicy on my way home from Yellowstone. I was wary of the mixed reviews but had a good experience with good service. But I remember telling my best friend that Boiling Crab was better because the sauce had more garlic and more flavor.   We ordered 2 lbs of crawfish and 1lb of clams, both mild with garlic sauce. The only thing you can order a half pound of its the shrimp. I counted about 18 clam shells which was much more than I thought we would get for 1lb. I have defaulted to mild now, which surprisingly still slightly has spice.   Everyone I know gets the Whole Shebang seasoning but my boyfriend and I both agree that you can't discern the different flavors. To us, the flavors become muddy. I don't know why \"garlic butter\" is now \"garlic sauce\" but it's my go-to seasoning. The garlic chunks were softer at this location than the socal ones. This wasn't necessarily bad, it was just different.   My boyfriend's dad was devouring the crawfish at a rapid rate. Seems like I picked the perfect place for us to celebrate his birthday. His mom had fun taking pictures of the restaurant, especially the hanging shark wearing a bib. She even took a bib as a souvenir. They asked me to send then the address so I'm thinking they like this place as well.   FYI: Even though you can write on the wooden walls (good luck finding any empty space), there is a sign mentioning the $100 fine for writing on the booths, floors, off tables.",

If you've never had crawfish, and you're in Vegas and wanting to try something new, this is a great place to wet your beak.  It's a little off the strip, so be forewarned.  The place is huge, and there are plenty of small TV's (though crappy quality, I never made a note in my phone about what brand).  Many people like the shrimp, cause you get more meat for your buck.  But crawfish has a unique flavor, and I do recommend getting a pound to play with.  Yes, it's a lot of work for such a small morsel of meat, but it's more of an socializing activity for me than a dining experience.  A beer goes well with the spice.  Arvin T swears the snow crab is the best.  He also raves about their sweet tea... idk why, I tasted his and it was ok.  But then again, maybe he knows his sweet tea, so give it a go if you're a fan.",

I came here on a Monday night while visiting Vegas and got there at about 6:55-7PM. (NOTE: If you arrive AFTER 7PM be prepared to wait) We waited 10 minutes for our table of 3 but it went by pretty quickly. I already knew what I wanted. Our waitress Nadia was super friendly and helpful. She came by and welcomed us and brought us some waters to start. We ordered a round of beers and she put our bib on. I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp to share in the Whole Sha bang sauce in medium spicy. I'm pretty good at handling the heat but, wow, I under estimated \"medium,\" its actually pretty up there on the spicy scale.   I ordered my corn and potatoes in the Hot flavor and that thing was SPICY. I think I cried a bit... I would just stick to medium. lol I love that they have rice! I eat my rice with the sauce and my shrimp. :p Nadia was really attentive and refilled the much needed water often. I really enjoyed eating at this place, I would def recommend it and would go back next time I'm in town.",

Corn- Lemon Pepper - Super buttery Fried Catfish with french fries. - YUM and even if you don't order the fish you should order a side of fries. Ive also had their gumbo which I wouldn't recommend.

Pour some sauce in a styro cup and take our effing money!!! what the hell....other place offered to do it, we didnt even have to ask.  Other place sells bread to dip into the sauce, this place will tell u to bring ur own or go buy it from the market next door....REALLY?

People go in there spending a minimum of $10/lb on multiple pounds, and you want to charge the people 25 fricken cents for water?!?!?!?! unbelievable.  overall the service was a big factor, it wasnt nearly as good as the other place.

The waiter brought the manager to us & he said \"the sauce taste different than California\" & they took back the food. Only paid for the sweet potatoes fries that where very good.",

My only compliant is that, the last few times I've visited, they've been out of blue crab (my favorite). But, I know that doesn't reflect on their servers, cooks or hostesses. Keep up the great service, I'll be back soon :)",

Still waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated but the drinks came right away. I just thought the service could've been better because it was a bunch of different people coming to our table to help us and we didn't know who to ask for more stuff. I actually liked the clams in the whole sha-bang sauce...other than that, my crawfish was obviously frozen because of the season or whatever...i still ate it but the flavor was really weird. We also got snow crab legs, blue crab and 4 lbs of shrimp. the shrimp was good to everyone at our table that tried it... Over all, i think the sauce and seasonings could've been better. Thats the only disappointment I have to say about it...",

Felt a bit Nickel and dimed by the menu offering, especially seeing how dry the seasoning of the whole she-bang was, also no options to include corn or potato. Shrimp came out overlooked and crawfish (fresh) were almost undercooked. Spice level was on point but seasoning was rather salty for my taste.  Service was spotty as well. I informed the waitress that this was our first visit to the boiling crab but was familiar with the concept from similar restaurants we visit.  Before even receiving our food the waitress had come by the table to see if we wanted to place an order for more food before the kitchen stops taking orders. Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, however there were still people being seated at new tables. We informed her that we would like to at least try the food first. When our food arrive we had not even opened the bags before she came once again fishing for additional orders. We were turned off by this and informed her that we were fine. After that we didn't really see our waitress anymore...  Personally I'd rather go to Hot N Juicy for my fix",

We ordered a child's chicken tender basket and specifically told the server to bring that out first. In fact, we ordered the child's food before we even decided on what the adults wanted to order. Well, our crab legs were out to the table before the child's meal was. We ordered soup to go and that was bright out before ANY of the other food was delivered to our table! Does that even make sense?! Needless to say, Boiling Crab, you have been a big disappointment the past few times I've been here. My daughter was so excited to try you out as she was visiting from NC.... You pretty much ruined that experience for her. Can't say I'll be back anytime soon.

    "text": "First off, I love the iconic walls inside The Boiling Crab, where guests are invited to write and draw whatever they want during their visit. The food is also delicious... same concept as Hot n' Juicy, where you choose your flavor, spice level, then seafood of choice plus add-ons -- then feast on the table with cute plastic bibs and get messy! I usually get the WHOLE SHABANG flavor with a POUND OF SHRIMP, with a few corn on the cobs (which is a must!) Never disappoints. We also ordered the KING CRAB... a little pricy, but a lot of meat!  I've been here a few times before, and usually I have no complaints. But my recent visit definitely left me with a few qualms. First of all, our waitress was just overall impatient. Yes, it was busy, but nonetheless, impatient. We made a few requests, such as an extra bottle of ketchup (which seemed to annoy her), for vinegar to eat with the crab legs (which seemed to annoy her more) that they didn't carry anyway... then when I received my drink, I ordered an unsweetened ice tea, I had to ask for sweetener which took 5 minutes to arrive. I added two packets of sweet n' low, only to find my tea was already a sweetened raspberry tea. When I brought this to her attention, her annoyance level went through the roof. No apology or anything. At this point, we were already getting uncomfortable. After that, her service became minimal -- to where she didn't check up on us or give us refills, unless we flagged her down.   The food was amazing, but I haven't had service that bad in a while. Considering this was also my birthday dinner too, it was quite a disappointment. Like I said, the food is great... maybe you'll get lucky and not get the same server as we did. Wish I had caught her name, but I think I'll try going to Hot n' Juicy more just to simply get better service next time.",

    "text": "All you California natives, the \"Boiling Crab\" has made its mark here in Sin City. Conveniently located central of Las Vegas (Decatur/Flamingo), inside the Food-4-Less plaza.   After reading reviews of the other crab/shrimp competitor, Hot N Juicy, it's amazing how many yelpers mentioned Boiling Crab. I personally have not been to the Boiling Crab before, they don't have a spot where I'm from in SD. So what better way to break bread with a bunch of other fellow yelp heads! Representin' from SD. SJ. SF & LBC!   Honestly, I could not really tell you the difference. Boiling Crab's name of the flavors are titled differently than HnJ, pretty much the same mix. The WHOLE SHA-BANG is the most popular seasoning, which has rajun cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter all mixed in together. On spice level, they have plain (simple), mild (just a kick), medium (gettin' hot in here), and XXX (can't feel my mouth!).    I love shrimp and spicy food. So I ordered the \"1 lb. shrimp whole sha-bang xxx!\" At first, I hesitated a little on picking XXX for spice level, but I liked it! You can definitely taste and feel the spiciness... and the slight burning sensation on your lips. Did not even break a sweat. Poor Eman S. sampled my food and was literally choking and gulped down a glass of water. yikes sorry! And Aljamin S. was already sweating profusely with just the Medium!   What I give the most stars is for the atmosphere & service. It blows HnJ out of the water. Its SPACIOUS to accommodate really large groups, no wait, customer service was on point, there's practically 100 TV's in the restaurant to watch the sports, and then have the capability of drawing/tagging on there walls! Pretty cool. See photos!   Only down fall, is they charge 25 cents for water even refills and 50 cents for ranch sauce. What the? Overall, good stuff. I'd come back again.",

The crab was frozen so was the crawfish, even worse than grocery store quality. Nothing was juicy and flavorful. Thanks, they gave us some salt n pepper.   Check u bag before u leave and tell them u want sausage/corn on the side. Anyway, this was the last time we go to this place. Bye bye.",

The food, a pound of milk shebang shrimp was overcooked and underspiced. The fried oysters ($10) amounted to little more then a half a handful of sad little oysters that were overfried in in yesterday's oil. I left annoyed and hungry and ended up in the drive through on the way home. $35 not well spent :( Damnit, just go to Hot and Juicy where it's always on point and the folks are glad to have you.

The other option is to pick a seafood on the menu by the pound and pick your flavoring and they shake it all up and bring it in a plastic bag, and you go to town with your bare hands and leave stinking of garlic and Cajun seasoning...

Your host will seat you in front of a table covered with butcher paper. This acts as your dish for the duration of your meal! Put on your bib and hopefully you will not have worn white. We always order shrimp and crawfish. Their sauces are super savory and buttery and keep us coming back. We also get chicken tenders and fries without seasoning to dip in their mouthwatering sauce.

It is pretty pricey. A small basket of calamari is $10 and fries are $5. Also you pay market price for some items. It can also get very busy, but wait foes by pretty fast and they usually run out of some items. It also takes a long time to get rice if you order it. Their crawfish and oysters aren't very good, but their shrimp and crab legs are amazing. My recommendation is to order take out. They have the best sweet potato fries ever!!",

Whatever seafood you're into, they have it. I like to go between the clams, shrimp, or crab. Depends on what mood I'm in. The whole shebang is the best. If you cant decide between the already amazing three choices they have, mix that stuff together! It's a flavor explosion! The farthest I've gone is up to spicy, and WOAH is it spicy! I don't even want to know what extra spicy tastes like haha. Even though it's always packed, it's seriously worth the wait, and your taste buds will thank you profusely.",

The ambiance is as if you're at Louisiana or somewhere in the south.  They seat you with a big sheet of paper that covers your table and bibs (yes the bibs are highly recommended).  I typically get 2 pounds of crawfish with the whole shebang sauce.  Garlic buttery cajun saucy goodness!  The only bad thing is you're going to smell like garlic for a good couple of days and if you have a purse, it'll smell like garlic for about a week.",

There is plenty of space and they were very accommodating when we asked to be moved after sitting at a table for 15minutes and realizing we wanted more space. The food came out hot and fresh tasted delicious and they let is split the check multiple ways and then still allowed us to essentially split those if needed. Our group wasn't huge but it wasn't small either about ten. Not once did I hear anyone complain or see anyone having to wait a ridiculous amount of time for anything. Again fun times.

I love the sauces, the crab and shrimp that I eat with the rice with my hands.  I love seafood in general and while there are plenty of other even fancier places with great seafood, the casual, just all out there grub atmosphere just makes it a different experience.  You can enjoy it in your rare form :)  There's a time and place or everything, sometimes you want to get dressed up and have a nice seafood dinner, sometimes you just want to sit there and get messy!

The shebang sauce is to die for. Be prepared to make a mess. It's worth it.",

    "text": "Well to sum it up who are allergic to seafood would probably need to stay away but  then again they do have other items in the menu such as their chicken wings that are pretty good too for the non seafood lovers.  But enough with the constraints let's talk about why we go here in the first place.    First up the service, this is probably the only Cajun style seafood restaurant in town that has the shortest wait time, probably due to the space, its twice as or close to three times bigger than the other similar restaurants in town.   Don't get me wrong, service is still fast, i like it that the servers are fairly organized.    Next the food, the shrimp is a great start and probably the best bang for the buck, note 3lbs is plenty for a party of 4.  Throw in some sausages, corn and some rice you got a full meal.  The snow crabs & king crabs are great albeit +/-$18/lb market price at least here in Las Vegas. So the price of your meal can get up there.  Their oysters are the common pacific oyster variety, fresh and always a sure bet.  Their crawfish can vary depending if its season or not which the latter you will get the frozen kind, which to doesn't bother me the least.  All in all the foods flavor is based on their numerous sauces which goes with the garden variety Lemon Pepper sauce to the hodgepodge of Cajun flavor The Whole Sha-Bang.  In addition, you can choose from varying heat levels, I love choices.  Overall, its a flavorful experience that keeps me coming back for more.",

    "text": "You can write all over the benches and walls in Heaven!  Oh wait, this is a review for Boiling Crab!  I've been here but once, but they earned the 5 star-nage with the decor, the ambience, and the food.  Decor - Wood everywhere, and written all over, paper covering the tables with a general sea-faring-ish attitude.  Profess your love for seafood, represent your area code, write whatever you want, just remember to follow the posted writing rule and that this is a family establishment.  Keep it clean!    Ambience - TVs playing sports, noisy, the sounds of people sucking crawfish and shrimp heads, licking their fingers, wearing bibs and just generally getting down and dirty with their food?  Me likey!  See that paper on the table?  That's your plate, that's your whole tables' plate.  I'm sorry, you wanted a what?  A F-who?  Oh, a fork!  What the f*ck is that for?  Your food came in a plastic bag, ya know.  Food - The whole Sha-Bang, Triple X.  That sounds like an all-inclusive sex resort, but no, that's the seasoning and level of hotness that I got for my meal.  Full flavored with little chunks of garlic and soaking in all it's glory, the crawfish and shrimp were cooked perfectly and were so delectable that when I was done, the bag looked just like new!  You could have re-used it!  Or not.    Seriously, if you love seafood like I love seafood, this is the place to throw down like there's no tomorrow.  If I was being forced to eat myself to death, I'd ask for a plane ticket to Vegas, and a bottle of Jameson 18 year to go with this last meal.",

And the food is always excellent across the board. I always go with the whole sha-bang with a medium spice level. Usually get a side of white rice to cool down the spice. The oysters are always fresh and clean and are usually a good size. I would definitely recommend this place over all the other options in Vegas for crawfish. Will be back every time!",

We liked The Whole She-bang medium hot the best.  The shrimp is served in plastic bags and  eaten on a plastic tablecloth (no plates).  You eat with your fingers and it gets messy.  There are plenty of sinks in the bathrooms.  Lots of seating and the place is clean.  The shrimp is big as Ragin Cajun and bigger than Hot N Juicy.  My only complaint is the music was too loud and a little obnoxious: hip-hop and modern rock, and popular mix.  Most importantly, the food was really good.  This will be one of our regular spots.",

What made my experience amazing was that, you don't get utensils, you eat with your bare hands, but you get a bib. I ordered Fried Shrimp and it came with Cajun fries (I got the second spiciest, it had just the right amount of spice). My sister got a pound of clams and the seasoning she chose all the seasonings, and it was just as awesome as my fried shrimps!",

    "text": "Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (14 of 365).  This is a great place to take a date because you get this interactive meal, get down and dirty with eating shellfish, and get to test your date on how hot and spicy they can take down.  I like the atmosphere in here because it has a home like feel and a chill ambiance.  I come here in my dress down clothes so I can get down and dirty with my crawfish.  I order the whole sha-bang!  I like it medium so I can still get some garlic flavor in there but still taste the seafood.  I get my bag of crawfish with two ears of corn inside and let them marinate in the sauce while I eat. Sometimes I have to take them out early before they get too marinated in the hot sauce that I can barely eat them!  I also order a side of sweet potato fries for some carbohydrates to cool down the heat a little.  What I like best about this place is that it's huge and accomodating for big groups of people, but they have an array of booths for some privacy if you come here with a friend or loved one.  You can even write on their walls to commemorate your visit!  I also like how they play the sports channels on  their TVs so that your boyfriend doesn't miss an important game.  And they have a plethora of TVs on their walls so you definitely can't miss a game!  I say go and try it ASAP!",

    "text": "I have heard all about this place and all of the Cali locations seem to be a bit out of control with crowds so I decided to visit this location on my holiday vegas trip. After doing some shopping at the Premium Outlets I decided to head over and check this place out since it was only about 10 min. away.   I walked in around 5:30ish on a Friday and it was pretty empty, there were only about 2-3 other tables occupied. Score for me! I had my pick of tables and booths to choose from. I settled into my booth and tackled the menu, I thought it was nice that they had several tvs hanging around the restaurant which worked out great for folks like me who decided to dine alone :-)  So I got right to it, I ordered the 2 lbs of the king crab legs with the whole shabang medium sauce and the Cajun fries. I was going to order the catfish as well but thought that it would be way too much food for me. I was right the crab legs and fries were a perfect dinner for me! The whole shabang sauce that everyone raves about lived up to the hype! It was garlicky, spicy and delicious; I even dipped my fries in it! The fries were crispy and delicious and the Cajun seasoning had just the right amount of spice to them. Service was pretty standard not bad but not spectacular. All in all I was impressed with my first boiling crab experience, I will def. be sure to check out one of the locations in Cali :-)",

    "text": "SO I really hate it when my fellow yelpers and I don't agree on a popular place, but I was not impressed at all with BC....I was really looking forward to it and it was just a bust for me.  We got here around 8 pm on a Saturday night and the hostess just told us that we beat the dinner rush. Yay us! Good sign! After looking at the menu we decided to go with the Shebang Snow Crabs, Lemon Pepper Shrimp, Cajun wings and cajun fries. The server told us that the mild spicy level was about the same as flaming hot cheetoes! Wow, thats super duper spicy to me so we went with the no spicy level. The wings and fries came out first, it was covered in their \"cajun\" powder and I wasn't impressed as there wasn't tons of flavor for being \"cajun.\"   The shrimp and crab came out at the same time. The sauces were red which wasn't what I expected (should have looked through pics first) not necessairly a bad thing. It had sort of a tomato based texture with chunks of their \"cajun spice\" and garlic. The sauces were alright, I just felt that the sauce didn't penetrate through the shrimp and crab. I know that's part of the food experience when you end up dunking them before putting them in your mouth, but it was that bland that you HAD to redunk them in the sauce. Luckily it was just the 2 of us so we could double dip. The shrimp was way over cooked to the point where the shell was so hard to take off. Crab meat was pretty meaty, but without the awesome flavors of the sauce it was just regular crab. I ordered a side of rice and the rice was dry and old...not very appealing. We didn't end up finishing our meal which is surprising seeing as we didn't eat all day.   Overall, I'm disappointed that I had a not so good experience at this place when everyone hyped it up and said it was better than any other place! Service was good, bathrooms have no paper towels which saves tress, but kind of a hassel. One of my friends recommended that I go back again to give it a second chance, but I won't be for awhile.",

The raw oysters tasted exactly like the ones in Westminster, CA but I was so disappointed in all the sauces (raw oyster sauce and whole shabang medium seasoning). I love Cajun seasoning and I've gone to BC, Claws, and Hot N Juicy more times than I can remember but this visit to the BC in Vegas was one of the worst. I was so disappointed in the watery, tasteless sauce that day that I even emailed them to let them know they need to step it up to match the taste of the CA locations. Whenever I'm in Vegas and craving Cajun seafood I just go to Hot N Juicy.",

Boiling crab doesn't have liquor license yet.... So no beer :( But you can bring your own beer or wine here if you like. You do need to show ID to prove you are over 21 thol. Oysters are big and juicy here. And they are cheap!! One dozen of oysters are only $13. The sauce I enjoyed the most was Shabang. It tasted with strong garlic flavor. I was really happy to see my check that night.( 3 pounds of shrimps, 2 dozens of oysters, fried calamari and 5 sodas only cost me under $100 before tips )",

Whenever we would ask questions about the menu, he would answer it with no hesitation. He was not one of those servers who would disappear once we got our order. He always checked up on us and ask if we were satisfied with our food. As always, the food was was delicious.   My favorite seafood is crab, so I had high expectations of this place. I got the whole shebang king crab legs with a side of white rice. If I had to describe my meal in one word, it would be \"heavenly.\" Remember, this is not some fancy restaurant. To eat your food, you have to use your bare hands. So just a reminder, you are about to get down and dirty.     The atmosphere of the place is amazing. Not only do they have welcoming employees, but the room makes you feel like you are on the boardwalk in California. Each and everyone that works here always seem to look like they are having fun. With their bubbly personalities, your server will try their best to make your experience outstanding.  Overall, this restaurant is incredible. You and your guests will have an enjoyable time.

For those that lived in California, the name \"Boiling Crab\" goes hand in hand with being known as the best place in the west to get Louisiana style crawfish. I also visited their southern California restaurant when ever I visited that area.  When Boiling Crab opened their first restaurant in Las Vegas, I was one of the first to try. Their seasoning is the same as any other Boiling Crab places, but the similarity stopped here.  A few months after their grand opening, I visited their places a few more times and got disappointed more and more. Unlike their CA restaurants, the quality of their seafood at their LV restaurant was not fresh. There were several times where I bit into the shrimp that was either rotten or spoiled.    I do realize not many people were aware of their restaurant yet and it will take time to reach the capacity that they have in CA. That doesn't mean that they should keep and served rotten shrimp. Doing this will mean losing customers, not gaining.  I, for one, will go back to Hot N Juicy when I'm in LV, but will definitely go to their Boiling Crab restaurant when I visited Santa Ana.",

I'm usually waiting around 40-60 minutes by the time I walk in to the time I get my food. But it's definitely worth the wait. Food is seasoned excellently and the servers are very attentive.",

    "text": "Delicious!! The first time I went here I had tried Hot & Juicy prior. I have to say that The Boiling Crab (insert greater than sign here) Hot & Juicy Crawfish.  You have to pay 0.50 for water which is weird and you're not able to bring \"outside drinks\" But other than that my boyfriend & I really enjoyed it!  We ordered 1lb of shrimp, with all of the spices in it and it is delicious when dipped in the juices in the bag and eaten with rice. We also ordered the chicken tenders basket and mild cajun fries. We could have appreciated more spice to our fries, and I wouldn't recommend ordering the chicken tenders basket because the chicken fingers are more like giant chicken nuggets (they dont really have the consistency of real chicken fingers if you know what I mean)   Also, they don't have any plates or anything so  if you grew up with traditional Filipino families (ie: use hands to eat EVERYTHING) then you'll feel like you're at home.  I was craving boiling crab again 9 days later, and so my boyfriend took me and this time we had 1lb of shrimp, rice, the catfish basket, and the gumbo with rice. We ordered the fries in \"medium\" spice and they were perfect. Our order that day was amazing and everything tasted delicious. It took two tries to perfect our order, but we will definitely be back!  Lastly, you'll be burping boiling crab after your delicious meal LOL! So be aware, just in case you have somewhere special to be afterwards.",

We were having a long day and one of our friends came in and tried to give a server a high five and the lady got offended and felt like our friend was trying to fight her, the servers went as far as to say that they called her a \"stupid bitch\" and some guy behind the counter stepped up as general manager and tried to say that we had proof of it on their cameras that we were trying to fight their servers. This is not what you should see at establishment, a gang of kids trying to gang up on a situation and backing each other up without a level headed GM seeing both sides to a story. Mind you that this, \"GM\" was not present when the situation was underway although he said he was. The situation was not was handled professionally, point blank. Minnesota is the land of nice, we came thousands of miles to this establishment to have a nice meal and there is no way in hell that we would ever try to fight anyone, what would be the point? We don't have anything against any of these servers. We didn't even make it to our table before these snotty kids gained an opinion about how the dining experience would play out. If you're going to boiling crab, make sure you don't interact with the servers, they'll get offended and kick you out.",

So, when I discovered on in Las Vegas and we had planned to go in a couple of week and NO LINES OR WAIT! i knew what i was going to do...Vegas here we come!! We arrived on a Monday!!   and set out..The place is big! plenty of tables and booths and NO LINES!!! NO WIATING! The staff greeted us at the door and lead us to a booth. SHe covered the table with a long sheet of paper aand put bibs around our necks and gave us the run down of the menu...But, I already menu...I've been looking at it online for days!  We ordered 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb crab legs, 1 lb crawfish all smothered in SHABANG SAUCE! I also had them trow in corn and potatoes. Hubby had fried catfish basket wi cajun fries.   I must say when all of that yumminess came to our table..we pounced on it as if ...we were waiting for weeks to try it!!  THe shrimp were big and juicy, the crawfish and crab legs equally good. Love the Shabang sauce the seasoning is deep, flavorful, garlicy sauce with a kick. The catfish basket included 5 nice size pieces andwell cooked fries with cajun seasoning.  We loved this meal so much, we came back again on Thursday! This time we had Shrimp (again...that good!), fried oysters and calamari, with potatoes and corn in the yummy shabang sauce!!   The food is so good, I guess I will have to go to the L.A. restaurant...and wait!  Oh the only dish it's missing is a Dessert...like a sherbert or ice cream to cool you off from the Spicy Sauce!",

Each visit, I have ordered 1lb of shrimp with sha-bang mild with an order of corn in the bag. I've also had the crab legs and lobster but although I have a taste for expensive eats, lobster and crab legs just don't do it for mel. I've sampled the crawfish too from a friend's bag but for me, there's no point to ordering crawfish unless it's the right season!  But: the shrimp in sha-bang mild is a godsend. The sauce is a mixture of garlic and heaven and if you don't try it, you're sincerely missing out. Large, perfectly cooked shrimp with the head still on (eating tip: rip the head off, suck some flavor out, then peel and eat the shrimp meet. ::drool::).  I love getting messy and eating with my hands, but of you've got a problem with that, BC probably isn't your place! Seafood orders come out in a plastic bag and after that: game on. Put on your bib, roll back your sleeves, and dig in!    I've also sampled the Cajun fries (addicting and delicious) the sweet potato fries, and the fried catfish. All wonderful!  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our orders have been mixed up on both visits and overall, the service hasn't been five-star worthy.  IMHO: Boiling Crab BEATS Hot 'N Juicy, hands down.",

    "text": "FAMOUS FOR: - Shellfish served in bags of hot cajun spices & sauce  I'VE TRIED - Shrimp in Whole Shebang Medium (8/10) - King Crab in Whole Shebang Medium (10/10)  Ohhh man! How lucky are you! If you're reading this - there's a good chance you're waiting in line at a Boiling Crab or are driving there. That means you're in the vicinity of a Boiling Crab or are making plans to be in the vicinity of one. All of these situations are so much cooler than mine, because the closest Boiling Crab to me is over 900 miles away!   If you've never been here, they did a really good job with their menu showing you the 3 steps of ordering. Most of the seafood is market price. You basically  1) Choose your seafood 2) Choose your sauce 3) Choose your level of spice.  It then comes to you in a big clear plastic bag with whatever shellfish drowning in the sauce of your choice. You have to peel or crack the shells and then eat it. I recommend re-dipping it in the sauce after peeling/cracking. WARNING! The sauce is HOT! Not immediate scalding hot, but probably can't stick your finger in there for more than a second.  It's also good to get fries or something too - because the flavors are intense, and you don't want to start getting accustomed to it. You need to simmer down with the fries or rice, and then shock the system again with the sauce again!  SAUCE: WHOLE SHEBANG The \"Whole Shebang\" is essentially all of the other 3 sauces combined. You get: Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Sauce all combined into 1.  Seasoning is great! Whatever shellfish you decide to drench in this sauce will get some added seasoning and fill in whatever small gaps might be left by the shellfish alone. If things start getting too salty, eat a few fries to calm things down, and then go for it again!  The flavors are awesome! Honestly, I can taste Rajun Cajun, and I definitely can taste Garlic, but Lemon Pepper is the little squirt in this bunch. There's nothing lemony about any flavor, but if you think hard about it, you can convince yourself that you taste it. The pepper is definitely not going to be individually picked out, since you got enough peppers in the creole seasoning. The garlic is awesome! There's no quenching my lust for garlic, so of course I'd want more, but there're garlic pieces floating around in that sauce sometimes.   SPICE: MEDIUM As for spice, I love spicy foods! I wanted to try XXX just to see how bad it was, but I was with 2 people who not only couldn't tolerate spice, but also had long nights of drinking, so they had sour stomachs. So, I had to go one step lower and got Medium.   Having said all that, Medium ain't really joking around either. The sauce flavors are all so delicious and intensely flavorful that you don't really complain too much about the spice, although I was a little disappointed. Fast forward to the end of the meal, and I was reaching for that glass of water! My lips were burning, and my tongue wasn't exactly reclining on the La Z Boy. This was one of the slowest gradual burns I've ever had, and it gets pretty hot. If Medium got this hot (which is 2nd to hottest), I'm even more curious now as to how bad XXX is!   SHRIMP The shrimp should be considered as a \"filler.\" Even with the sauce, it starts to get a little boring after a while, but a lb of shrimp will go a long way! Most are cooked right, but there're some that are a little well done, so they're kind of dry and rubbery...which means MOAR SAUS!! If you never had anything else here, and just started on shrimp, I think you'd be perfectly content. The shrimp is pretty clean, but I don't think they really make an effort to de-vein. Since you are actually peeling, nothing's hidden, and you see that line of shrimp poop, and suddenly, you want it a little less. I will say this, though, it is cleaner than other similar types of places I've been to!  KING CRAB Oh wow! The crab is just awesome. Even by itself, it's great! Perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and they're even pretty meaty! Then you add the sauce, and you just can't get enough! ...and there in lies the problem...market price is quite pricey! 1 lb could be up to $20, but 1 lb would hardly serve as an appetizer! That's why you have to get some shrimp in order to leave full.  BOILING GOLD I love this place, and you're damn right I'll be back! I just wish it didn't cost so much to eat here. I'd say a person could do 2 lb crab and .5 lb shrimp, plus drinks and sides, and get something like a $60-80 meal! You'll be satisfied, but not as full as you'd expect after dropping that much dough. In any case, pray you win at Vegas (yeah right) and wait in line here with the best of us! Now..if I can only convince them to open one here!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place out for a long time. I love Hot N' Juicy, but they are considerably more expensive than this place.   I will give you a couple of tips -  The price is more expensive at Hot N' Juicy, but the tasty and quality is much better.  You still reek of garlic for at least 24 hours after leaving this place.   We ordered, 1lb each of the following - Dungeness Crab (this is a whole crab, and it is typically 2lbs or more) King Crab  Snow Crab Clams  The only thing you'll get close to a pound is the clams. Everything else will be as close to a pound as possible.  We also had 2 rounds of beers and our tab was a little over $100. That is a very reasonable price for as much as we got.  I always recommend getting all of the flavors. The medium is pretty spicy, and I enjoy very spicy things. So if you like hot, get medium to hottest.   The flavor here is good, but could be better. Also, a couple of legs for the kind crab were over cooked, so it made is very difficult to get it out. As much as you pay for a pound for King crab, it's very frustrating if it's not cooked properly.  I did enjoy this place, and the service was good. I will probably go back, but I would always compare it to Hot N' Juicy's quality, but not complain about the price.",

They bring it to you in a bag full of all the juices and spices. There was no need to dip in butter; I think there was already butter in the bag of seasoning. We can't wait to go back as soon the bank account allows lol. The Cajun fries were crispy and delicious and the corn was great also",

Albeit an LA chain, boiling crab always hits the spot whenever I'm in Vegas. Snow crab will be a much smaller portion compared to shrimp (you must order shrimp). Don't miss out on corn on the cob and some sweet potato fries.   If you're really Asian, mix rice in the sauce.   Also, be careful of medium+ spicy - it can get pretty hot. Absolutely delicious.",

I think Houston crawfish restaurants have more of a kick in spices, and a more well integrated flavor in it, which makes me crave it more. Plus the price was pretty expensive, but i guess it's because it's a Las Vegas restaurant (they tend to be more expensive?). But enough comparison from Houston and lets focus on the restaurant!  Like i keep mentioning, It does have good flavors, and the service was pretty attentive, despite us dining during rush hour, so overall, it was a good experience. If you like crawfish, definitely try this place out. I believe it is a chain restaurant, so if you have it near you, its definitely worth giving it a try! I probably am a little more picky, cause Houston has spoiled me, but my friends enjoyed it very much, and they're locals here.",

I tried fried catfish which wasn't bad at all. The fish was not dry and there was definitely flavor to it. The gumbo was delicious and it's a huge portion. I would share that. Another note, water is 25 cents. It's not a big deal to me since it was $10/lb crawfish.   ...and the staff were all so friendly! I can't wait to be back.",

Over here, it seems like a little known gem since I only waited at most ten minutes! Plus, there were empty tables that I passed on the way to my table, meaning that they just purposely make you wait a little. Probably because everyone wants to be hipster and eat on the Strip. But that's expensive--why fork over your winnings from Vegas there when you can get more for your money here.  It is kind of hard to find this place since they don't even have their name on the main plaza sign. But it's not like they need it anyways due to the hype. Take the waitress's offer and have her tie on the bib for you, you're gonna need it. Definitely get Whole Shabang sauce with the cajun fries, which are perfectly crispy. I actually expected the sauce to be a thicker consistency, but it's actually watery but still garlicky spicy goodness. And remember, mild here is not that spicy so spicy-lovers, go to the next level! I would say skip the gumbo, it's not that great. It's better to stick to what they're best at--seafood!",

I remember trying to go on a rando Wednesday night at 8pm and there was a 1+ hr wait still.   Food: The quality of the seafood and the flavoring of them are both on point. I really like the clams! Shrimp is good too, except I'm too lazy to peel so not as big of a fan. Crawfish, I'm just ok on that normally, but I always get it because it feels weird to go to a place like this and not. I haven't tried the crab here. Also, a lot of work to eat crab. Gah, I'm just lazy. Clams all day! I will say, everything gets pretty salty after a while. Obviously, since it is heavily seasoned/sauced.   Prices: I don't remember how much things cost, but I do remember it being pretty reasonable.   Will return when I'm in Vegas ($10 ish cab ride from strip)! Better than going to the SoCal ones.",

The service is on the spot and food is consistently tasty. I arrived on a Monday just after 5:00 and there was no line! Wow that's a first for Boiling Crab. Started off with a half dozen of oysters on a half shell. They were served on a bed of ice and were medium sized really delish. I followed the oyster appetizer with a pound of peel and eat shrimp with their original rajun Cajun sauce and medium spiciness.  I got really greedy and ordered fried oysters. They were decent but I preferred the oysters on the half shell.   I'll definitely return here again especially if I don't have to wait in line!",

When u choose your type of seafood u get to choose the type of seasoning , such as Ragin' Cajun for me, and the level of spiciness, which fortunately for me they have non spicy as an option. My favorite also are their side red potatoes and their cajun fries.   They have a lot of tv's everywhere so it's great for watching the game.

I ended up ordering fried oysters and 1lb of frozen crawfish. You pay for what you get since frozen isn't as good and it's cheaper. It was 9$ a pound. The crawfish was little as well. I definitely wouldn't be ordering frozen crawfish again. We also ordered a kids chicken basket, 2lbs of clams for $22, I order of snow crab for $14.25, wings, sausages, corn, potatoes, and french fries.  If I knew how much better the clams were than the crawfish I would have order a pound of that instead. The snow crab was not by pounds but by clusters. Barely a pound for 14.25$. I thought everything tasted mediocre and there's better seafood joints around. I would not be back.",

The wait would we were told about 30 minutes, we decided to wait, but we got seated in only 20 minutes, so it was great.  We got service right away and placed our order.  I ordered clams and shrimp by the pound with mild spice, and the hub bub.   The shrimp are huge, with head on, the sauce was just spicy enough to give my eyes a little water!  I also ordered a cup of the gumbo without rice, it has a very strong okra base, dark brown rue, very good flavors.  The rest of the table ordered fried baskets, I tried some of the big rings of calamari, it was tender, and the sweet potato fries were good.  Service was good, lots of fun in the place, big screen TVs everywhere to watch your favorite team, and food was great.",

    "text": "This place is totally misleading!!!   We arrived, party of 4, at approximately 4pm on a Sunday. We had to wait 20 minutes even though there were numerous empty tables. Which tells me right away that the management is no good.  The decor is graffiti and it is on every piece of wood in the place. Ok and here's the kicker, they had no CRAB!!!!!!  No blue crab, no dungeonous crab!!!  I came there wanting and expecting to eat crab, because of the name and was very disappointed. And don't expect a plate, not even paper, or any cutlery either!!  The food arrives at the table in a plastic bag and you just use the table, with a fresh piece of butcher paper, as your plate. We had crab legs and peel and eat shrimp and not even a receptacle to put the waste. So in order to not to feel like total barbarians we combined our bags to have an empty one to put our waste in.   The food was good. I do have to say that. The beer was a little chill but not cold.  I had the red potatoes which come whole so I had to use my hands and it was so messy because of the seasoning sauce that is in the bag. And the potatoes were undercooked.  Our server was very good and knowledgeable.  But I think if I want crab or seafood in the future I won't be going here!!  If I'm feeling 3 years old and have the urge  to write on the walls with a marker or crayon, this will be the place I come to.   I think this place has potential, but I don't think it's being managed properly.",

Let's start off with the ridiculous line up front, again I am not complaining because it's worth the wait. Waiting for 20 minutes and I heard the host asking the people before if a table is okay I am guessing its because most asks for a booth! I think it's nice of them to ask because some people doesn't want to wait.  They changed their menu from the last time I was there (prices) I always get the shrimp, I like it mild with rice on the side (asian here). There's probably 15-20 pieces in there and man you'll be full! Sweet tea has an after taste to it, I don't know what that is but I liked it (hopefully that's a good thing).  I hated the service because the waiter is not into it. I mean you should really make your customers feel good but that's my opinion maybe he's on his man period that day.  Again, food is always awesome.",

I always think boiling crab is better than hot n juicy, no matter the seasoning, freshness of it's seafood.  My gf and I ordered 1lb of frozen crawfish, 2lb of shrimp is different sauce; I knew the frozen crawfish taste bad, I haven't eaten the frozen one before, so I wanted to give it a shot, but I was totally regretted. DO NOT TRY THE FROZEN CRAWFISH!!! on the other hand, our shrimp order is a bit weird. I could tell the freshness is different in each bag. I had no idea but the other bag is fishy and spoiled (very much!). I knew restaurants could not give their best to every customers. I am not the kind of spreading \"DO NOT GO HERE\" after having bad experience. I always like boiling crab, so I would give another shot.",

Try and pour some of the sauce on your rice, mix it with some butter from the corn and it just tastes divine. We always end up ordering so much food from here because we take the sauce home and eat it with rice the next day. Food is always great, service is fast and servers are helpful with any questions.

That's not anything against the server, more the way the layout is managed. Our server was nice, it's just that we hardly saw her. Everything took a long time from waiting on a table, to getting our food, and everything came out one item at time so there was a point where one of my friends was waiting with his bag of crab legs for about 5 or 6 mins, for the rest of us to get our food so he could start eating politely.  Oh and we had to remind her to bring our beers 3 times! Honestly, I'd recommend the Hot N Juicy not too far from here as a more complete experience service and taste wise. I mean the food was good, but hot n juicy has better sauce flavors and more attentive service. We probably wouldn't go back.",

So tonight my sister and I visited this place in search for a great crab. She ordered a dozen raw oysters and a bag of shrimp. I asked for a Dungeness crab and sweet potato fries. First, delicious fries!!!! My last meal on Earth will have to be a few of these fries. My crab was good but I wasn't impressed. My sister thought the oysters were too big since she prefer small-sized ones so that they don't taste and smell too overwhelming. We enjoyed the shrimp with their shabang spices. Overall, I will come back for the fries!",

    "text": "So many TVs everywhere, Boiling Crab puts Buffalo Wild Wings to shame.  There was a perfect view of the game in every angle of the room. I went there for a NBA Finals game and I was stoked to see so many televisions. If this place wasn't a restaurant, I would assume it's a tv convention with all the tv's they have in there. Best part of my night, I ate for free because we had a bet on the game, and the loser had to cover the tab (Eat for free?? Oh yes, I LOVE it!).  The food was great, service was even better. There are dozens of people on the floor scurrying around refilling drinks and serving countless bags of yummy shrimp, just waiting to be devoured by hungry guests. The shrimps are gigantic but the portions are pretty small. I had to order two bags for a filling meal.  Oh yeah, make sure to take a sharpie or pen. Inside it looks like some severe graffiti took place, but the restaurant is OK with people writing on the walls. I regret not bringing one because I wanted to doodle all over the walls.  One gripe: They are missing a sauce between medium and Triple X. Isn't there supposed to be a \"hot\" somewhere between that? Because Triple X is too damn spicy and medium is too mild. Oh, and I wish they had pitchers of beer. Ordering them individually takes out the fun. :[  But I'm nip-picking here. This place is up there with Hot and Juicy for me, as far as the quality of food. However, in terms of service and venue, I would choose Boiling Crab in a heartbeat. It is so much roomier, faster and better service, and thousands of TVs. Food comes out in less than 5 minutes, 10 minutes if they are busy. I'm definitely coming here once football season starts.",

Crab legs were delicious but are pricey. Shrimp and clams were very cheap and you get a good amount of them. Definitely go with the whole sha bang to get all the flavors. The medium spice was very hot so I would suggest just getting mild for a slight spice kick.",

Surprisingly the wait here is not that long compared to the ones in SoCal and I'm assuming its due to the fact it really hasn't caught on yet in LV since it has just opened.  Plenty of seating, flatscreen tvs for my LAKERS and 49ers games, walls that you can tag on, and good service.  I come here to order my usual whole shaBang (all the flavors in one) in medium spice level, smothered on my shrimp and crawfish, cajun fries, oysters, and I can't forget my rice which I top off with the shaBang sauce as well.  Make sure you ask for lime, salt and pepper to add a kick to the flavor.  When you come here, don't get all fancied up 'cause you're bound to get smelly and messy anyway.  Oh they charge 25 cents for water!? That sh*t better be water coming  down fresh from the Rocky Mountains.",

    "text": "Okay... This has been a while in coming. I came in here just as they were opening on a weekday, and the place was empty, but people were coming in slowly. I was promptly informed that they were out of blue crab and only had frozen crawfish. No prob as I was here for the snow crab legs. Got seated promptly and waited on just as quick.  I ordered the snow crab legs not spicy and with the whole sha-bang which I guess is Cajun, lemon pepper, butter and garlic. I also asked for 2 pieces of corn. Me loves corn. Everything comes in a big steaming plastic bag. The table is covered with a sheet of paper ripped off a roll and this paper is containment for the entire tables mess that's left when the meal is done. All the empty shells etc...are just thrown on the table and everything is picked up in one fell swoop. The waiter gave me a sheller and cracker tool. I also needed a fork to help get the meat out of the legs. Anyway... It was awesome. The flavor was magnificent. I could taste the old bay, the garlic, the butter...very very sweet tender crab. The corn made the meal even better. I consider myself a corn connoisseur. I hate when I get corn that has been soaking in a water bath for so long it is flavorless and soggy. This was crisp and soaking in the sauce just made it full of goodness.   Oh the sauce... I used the eaten corn cobs to sop up the sauce and just kept sucking the sauce out of the cobs. The garlic chunks were so plentiful and soft I didn't know how much garlic I was eating... When I went to pick up my wife from work afterwards, she asked if I had leftover food in the car...that's how intense the smell was. My hands reeked of garlic for several days afterwards. I told her she needed to try the place...I couldn't wait to take her there so we went back that weekend. She really enjoyed it. So mucho that we took friends who were visiting a few weeks later. That third visit was the best one yet! That nights meal had the most crab of all found in the bag. Each leg was big and oh so tender. We really really love this place, and writing this makes me think tomorrow's dinner is going to be there.   The only problem I have had in 3 visits was on the last visit with friends, I ordered the mild instead of not spicy. I asked for two pieces of corn, my wife asked for one. When the meal came the bag I was handed had one piece and my wife's had two, so we asked if it was just each others order and we just should switch bags. He said no...hers was correct and he took my bag back to get another piece of corn...well 20 minutes later everyone was in the middle of their meal and I hadn't gotten my food back yet. All for another corn. My waiter disappeared for 15 minutes so we had to ask another for my food. Anyway it turns out after talking with my wife that it was switched bags from the get go. She said here's was a bit spicier than she xpected. We like spice so it wasn't a problem, but the waiter messed up...no real biggie. Not going to keep me from going back. My friends who can be real picky loved it too. The husband who can be real proper sometimes, dove in head first. Not knowing how to eat crabmeat I showed him, and by the end of business his hands were bsolutely covered on sauce...wish I had my camera handy.",

    "text": "It's funny that I had been itching to drive out to LA just to eat boiling crab because all of my friends from SoCal always ate at this place. Apparently there would always be a 45 minute wait, so this place HAD to be good. Finally Boiling Crab was in Vegas and I thought I would be one of their first customers. Haha, that was not the case because I waited 2 months after they opened to actually eat here. I think I wasn't as excited because people who tried California Boiling Crab and LV Hot N Juicy said HNJ was better. But of course I had to see for myself so my friend and I came in on for a late lunch/ early dinner. We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in the shabang sauce with potatoes, corn, and cajun fries. Boiling Crab is only the second restaurant I've been to that has the same concept, so I had no choice but to compare them with HNJ. The sauce was thinner and tasted like it had less flavor. It also seemed like the sauce was just all butter and the spices weren't mixed in very well. The shrimp also made my fingers itch, which was kind of odd (no I'm not allergic). The potatoes, corn, was good as usual. And the cajun seasoning on the fries was surprisingly good because I was anticipating it to have too much paprika or something. The service was promp because I guess there's no assigned servers to a certain table/ area. I know that for a fact because after we placed our order, another gentleman comes with a note pad and pen to ask us if we ordered already. Boiling crab is \"a-okay\" in my book, but sorry to say I prefer the other place half a block up north.",

I understand this, but I work in the restaurant industry and u have to make exceptions for simple orders such as sides.

    "text": "Be prepared to get messy! They've got freshly prepared seafood served in plastic bags with a delicious sloppy sauce. We tried the \"whole shebang\" sauce which is a mixture of their lemon pepper, garlic and Cajun sauces. This is a definite must try sauce, it was spicy, buttery and garlicky all at the same time. I had the mild version, which was still pretty spicy. So be careful with the spice level as it is spicier than you would think. Also, don't turn down using the bib or you will be sorry!  One thing I need to mention is that I found the pricing system a bit confusing. I had the waiter explain the system to me, and it seemed to help but I was not really sure until I got the bill. My best explanation is that they charge per pound, but most things are not served by the pound. For instance, the crab legs were around .8 or .9 lb a serving, but they give you the pricing for 1 lb. Some items are more than 1lb, like the lobster and whole crab. I will attach a picture of the receipt so it is clearer.    My second question was, how much food do I order? I am not used to ordering food in this fashion. So for 2 people, we had 3 seafood items, corn on the cob and 1 basket of fries. This seemed to be enough food for two. The 1 basket of fries is large enough to serve 2 people.",

It only lasted 15 minutes.   We sat and order the fried oysters, lb of shrimp, Cajun fries and the king crab legs. Plus a side of fries and coke. All the seasoning were the sha bang and medium spice.   The rice came first, no reason when there were nothing else served so the rice got cold when food actually arrived. Followed the Cajun fries, shrimp, fried oyster and then the king crab legs. Everything was alright until I saw the king crab legs. For $45 I got three king crab legs and they weren't meaty at all. (SCAM)   Fried oysters were bland, and the Cajun need lots of ketchup. Only the pound of shrimp held up to its name.   All the seasoning were over salted and that's pretty dreadful. Our server Kristin, I believe didn't tell me about the refill soda. She only asked if I wanted a refill when I payed the bill. What???? I was in need of more soda cause the medium spice was pretty hot. Aside from that, seems like the severs here like to take care of the larger tables considering they would tip more than a smaller table. Plus she didn't offer a bib until I notice everyone had one and I asked for it! Seems fair I deserve some better service since my entire order was not cheap.   Won't be returning to this establishment. Wouldn't recommend the king crap legs to anyone. Totally not worth it for so little in return. Hopefully management can work something out about the over priced king.",

    "text": "Dining on crabs is not my favorite thing to do.  Although, I like eating the crustacean, I dislike working to get the meat out of the shells.   Feels like I get hungrier because I have to work to get the food.  So what was I doing at Boiling Crab in Las Vegas waiting over 30 minutes for a table?  Well, I have wanted to try the food at this chain restaurant for awhile now.  You know what.  I was pleased with our meal here.    We shared King Crab legs, Shrimp, Corn, and Potatoes.   We had it flavored with the whole Sha-Bang!!  It is a mixture of Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic sauce.  Super flavorful!!  Went with medium spicy for just a kick.  Did I have to work to get the crab meat?  Yeah, but it was well worth it.  It truly is messy to eat all that yummy food that we dig out of those plastic bags.  No wonder they give us bibs!  Overall, we had a very nice time at Boiling Crab.  Terrific atmosphere with all the tvs.  Delicious food and good service too.  Now I know that I am a fan of Boiling Crab.  Are you?",

There's plenty of seating so this place is great for large parties.   Came in with a party of 11 and we ordered plenty of items including: shrimp , crawfish & crab (you order by the lb. @ market price) , oysters (9$ for 6 pc. or 15$ for 12 pc.) , fried calamari (10$) , Cajun and sweet potato fries (4$) , etc. I wasn't really a big fan of the crawfish or crab, but I definitely liked the shrimp and oysters. We got our seafood w/ the \"whole sha-bang\" sauce (which is a combo. of their Cajun , lemon pepper & garlic sauce) and w/ medium spice. Medium was still spicy and flavorful :) Everything was super fresh. I also have to mention I had the best fried calamari here. You can actually taste the calamari and not just fried dough. Most people say that the Cajun fries are the best but I preferred their sweet potato fries over the Cajun. Also have to note , one serving of fries was more than enough for a few people. We didn't even finish our fries even though they were delicious.  Our service from our hostess & waiter was great from start to finish :) They split our orders and bills among groups no problem.",

Just a heads up for people who do not like a lot of spice: if you order mild spice, it'll probably taste like medium spice...medium spice will probably taste like hot spice, etc. If you're craving seafood and spice, this is the place to go. **WARNING*** it gets extremely busy around 5-7pm so be prepared to wait for a table!",

I have no shame admitting I have waited that long because my friends and I were mentally prepared to do so.   On this particular visit, our wait was only 5 minutes long (3 people around 9:00PM). Our waitress Amy greeted us and we quickly ordered our food. I ordered a 1lb of shrimp, mild, with the Garlic Seasoning. It's my go to flavor choice and I've never had a bad experience.   My friends ordered shrimp as well, but with the Whole Shabang Seasoning and a side of mild Cajun fries. I highly recommend sopping up some of your seafood seasoning with your fries for extra flavor!  Side notes: Compared to Hot n Juicy, I much prefer Boiling Crab. Also, the large shark in the middle of the restaurant is a Pokestop for anyone who needs supplies while they dine.",

The waitress did mention that the sauce was the biggest change. The whole shabang was more of dry rub versus the liquidy buttery sauce. However, she did mention that if you request for extra sauce, they will add it to your order.   We had a couple clusters of King crab, 1.5 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound mussel, 1 pound clams, half dozen oysters, corn, rice, and cajun fries. We order everything with the whole shabang sauce because it is the best one out there.   This place will always be the best cajun seafood spot and I doubt we'll find anywhere better. If you know of any I should try please let me know.   Boiling Crab is life!!!",

    "text": "Server (also named A-A-Ron) is the all star here. We were super happy with our experience here... mostly. Seriously THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I personally experienced was the humbling realization that I can't even handle \"mild\" spice. I cried a little bit. Inside and out. Yet, it didn't stop me because the food was so good anyway.   Go in knowing this place is going to be a mess. The establishment itself is pretty nice and they do a good filtration job not to make it smell like a sea food market to my surprise. But you are given a dorky looking bib for a simple reason... you're going to need it.  We got ourselves a full pound of shrimp, an order of potatoes, and three orders of corn on the cob paired with two blue moons to drink and cups of water to drink on. It costed us barely $40. That was not a bad night.   Now, for the recommendation... get \"The Whole Shebang\" flavoring. It is nearly impossible not to be satisfied with your choice. It was FANTASTIC. The potatoes we weren't all that excited about. They were just potatoes. But the corn on the cob saturated in that flavor was to die for. The shrimp comes in that natural state where you have to physically peel all the shell off yourself but it is amazing none the less.  So so good. You can choose your grade of spice between 1-4. I chose a #2 (mild) and I was hurting. Granted, I'm accountably a bag of wuss. So find out for yourself, don't take my word for it.   If you're of age, get a beer with it. It pairs really well with the experience and takes some of the fire away from your mouth, which was a nice saving grace.   I will end note this with the fact that we went on a Monday in the early evening (around 6pm or so), and there was not much of a line at all but I have left this place several attempts because the line is SUPER long and they don't take reservations over the phone. It's kind of a first come first serve kind of thing. Which on one end, I get. But from a guest perspective... come on lol. Consider it. It will make most of your guests very happy, I promise.  Overall, I love you. I promise to return again (on your slow day, of course).",

After leaving Portland after a 2 year stint without crawfish, I decided to head to The Boiling Crab with the idea that it will be similar to my fave HNJ. The flavoring was pretty good. There was zero juice in my bag, and I suppose you are suppose to pay extra for that. They also overcooked our shrimp, and it was a real struggle to get the shell off of them. The server assumed we didn't need help and was there minimally. We needed silverware, but got halfway through the bag before she stopped by again. I couldn't even find her to flag her down.",

The only downside I would say about this great place is the wait time on weekends. You're looking at around 45 to 95 minute wait time anytime after 6pm (but you can't complain because the food and service gets delivered. The wait time is well worth it for me.)  I would suggest to go during the week days as it's not crazy busy. As for food, I always get a pound shrimp whole sha-bang mild flavored because I like a little spice with sweet potato fries. Also if I'm feeling even hungrier I will get the cajun chowder with a side of rice (instead of rice inside the chowder.",

Prices were reasonable. Cost a little over $113.00 for 2 lbs each of crawfish, shrimp, clams, a dozen oysters, small order of gumbo, and 4 cups of rice.

I would just say any cause I really don't see the any difference. the servers are young but they are so cheerful and attentive. I found it funny when they asked have we been here before. the menu is simple and it's pretty much the same items, just prices changes from the market price. they did raise up the prices for lb of shrimps and fresh crawfish--its like that everywhere you for Cajun shrimps or crawfish. it's so worth it tho.

Spent some considerable time in the Bay area and didn't realize that there is a location in San Jose. At any point about a 38 minute wait. Very busy although it was Saturday night  Lot of hustle and bustle. Staff was friendly the hostess asked if it was our first time. It was and when our waitress Allie came she was very thorough explaining the menu. By the way very strong menu.  Started of with the Catfish basket with Cajun fries. Corn on the cob. Pound of King Crab legs soaked in Garlic sauce with Cajun sausage. All I can say is all that flavor took me on a trip to seafood land. Beautiful night out the Boiling Crab is a no out triple with the bases loaded.",

The service was amazing, the prices were affordable, and me and my wife enjoy one of the best meals we've ever eaten in our entire lives and were completely stuffed for about 75 bucks.

Make sure to get the rice and fries - I like to get the clams, sausage and shrimp for seafood but depends on what's available. Get the whole shabang sauce and whatever spice level works for you but mild is a good starter level.   The restaurant isn't on the strip but so worth taking the short uber ride!",

From the time you walk in, you see all the names and messages on walls and booths of all the people that have eaten there before you. My name is written on a few different spots throughout the restaurant. The servers are super nice and don't get frustrated when you keep asking for extra limes. They also tie your bib which is a cute touch.  You gotta get the whole shabang flavoring on all your seafood!!! It's pretty much all the seasonings put together. Mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There's a ton of juice in the bag so you can dunk your seafood or your fries into it. So good!!!! Also get a side of corn an potatoes and they'll throw it right in the bag so it'll be flavored as well!!! Mmmm",

Service is flawless and very courteous and the better a always remember me and my order.  Thank you boiling crab.",

Couldn't substitute anything, not even fries. 7. Catfish was good, but not worth the drive. 8. Waiter was nice, even felt bad they couldn't honor my request. 9.

My next stop was Cravin' Cajun which was reaaaaal good until they went out of business, so finally decided to check out The Boiling Crab.  No trouble finding parking, it is inside a local shopping center. Had no trouble getting seated, no wait. It is cafeteria style or you can sit in a booth in the back which is were we went. The service is fast, I order 2 pounds of Lemon Pepper flavored crab, it came with potatoes which were delish.  The flavor was so good cooked spicy to your liking, I always order more after I blow through my 2 pounds. I like it better than Hot N' Juicy (don't get me wrong, I also like Hot N Juicy, this is better tho). If your a crab fan check this place out, better priced than the competition. If I'm in the mood for crab this is where we go. Worth the stop, its located on the NW corner inside a business complex on Flamingo/Decatur (busy area).",

But after reading the yelpers reviews, I knew I had to try it.  1.  Parking - A lot more parking selection compared to HnJ locations!  2. Seating - Hella lot more room at this place and therefore, they are able to handle many more people, size of parties.  This is an added plus.  3.  Service - Just like HnJ, very friendly staff. The only difference i notice is that here, it seems like low down fun and being part of the fun and at HnJ, it seems to be all about the \"cult\" of HnJ.  Both very cool, good staff, just had a good time here  4.  Food - We had the Shrimp, Crawfish, Filet of Fish, Sausage and Corn on the Cob, Sweet Potato Fries.  All I can say is WOW.  We had guests from Atlanta and from Rome, Italy with us and they absolutely loved it.  That is saying alot in the great seafood capital of Rome and how much our guests loved this place.  5.  So Casual - I love the low down shorts and flip flop style relaxation mode of this place!  6.  Ambiance - From the multitude of TV Screens showing plenty of sports, to the wood paneled walls where you can scribble on and do your graffiti, the place hits the spot when it comes to creating the perfect ambiance to get down and dirty with some serious shellfish.  GK says this place is pretty awesome and check it out.",

    "text": "Finally had the chance to try The Boiling Crab.  The restaurant is visible on the west side of Decatur Blvd between Twain Ave and Flamingo Road.  Nice, big, bright restaurant space.    We ordered 1 lb of shrimp in non-spicy garlic spread, 2 lbs of shrimp in medium whole shabang sauce, 1 lb of clams in medium sha-bang sauce and 1 fried catfish dinner.  Well, we devoured the shrimps and clams - the sha-bang sauce was absolutely delicious especially the clams in that sauce.  For some reason, I found that the clams had more chopped up garlic.  I'm thinking it's because you can scoop up the wonderful garlic bits with your clam shell and then slurp it all up in one go!  I was impressed with the size of the shrimp and freshness of the shrimp.  The catfish dinner was really, really good. Not at all fishy.  Came with a full basket of fries - you can choose the spice level of your fries.  Why only 4 stars out of 5 stars - The Drinks - soda is $2 but believe it or not, they charge for H20!  25cents for Water - what a ripoff!  Not only that, they don't have hot water.  How hard is it to get a kettle for a restaurant?!?  But I must say, my waiter was really nice in that he offered to heat up the cold water in the microwave.    Not too bad - will come back.  Hopefully, they will re-think charging for water.    Oh yes - you can leave your mark in the restaurant.  Bring a fat marker and leave a comment on their walls.",

    "text": "We had heard that H n J and Boiling Crab's owners or businesses were related, and had always wanted to try what our Cali friends were raving about.  We were stoked to see that it had come to town, and with such great reviews in such a short period of time, so we had to give it a try.  First, our seafood resume: Semi-regulars at Hot n' Juicy, which is great but crowded and long waits, and terrible parking. Crawfish, of course, is their mainstay. Then Cajun Crawfish (now defunct), which we also liked a lot; at least the takeover addressed the accessibility issues. Crab Corner near St. Viator's, which was also very good, but not the same style as the above-mentioned. Shucks, Joe's, not bad not great.  When you're eating seafood, you're getting dirty, and the tables were plain and adequately spaced apart for that purpose.  There are TVs everywhere, and we the Saints game on.  Kids (and adults) can scribble on the walls, and mark their territories.    We ordered dungeness crab, shrimp, and crawfish, so we could give a more well rounded analysis.  We had a single ordered delayed for some reason, but otherwise the food came out in a timely fashion.  Water for $.25 was kinda lame. (I wonder if you brought your own cup if they'd charge you? ;)  )  The crab was very good, fresh, and flavorful.  The appropriate tools were provided  (crackers, picks) for crabbing. The shrimp was of a good size, tasty, and lended itself well to the She Bang sauce.  Your fingers and hands are going to smell for hours, just embrace it and dig in.  The crawfish were a little disappointing, and didn't taste as fresh as H n J.   Kids ate chicken and fries. Fries are essential for sauce dipping.  We also ordered gumbo, without rice. Definitely get it with rice, and there wasn't much to it alone.  Crab: 5 stars crawfish: 2 shrimp 5",

No paper towels in the bathroom; how are you supposed to clean up messes? The staff was friendly, but that doesn't make up for the fact they tell you they are charging you for a full pound of crab and that you will only get .9. They have an eclectic array of beer cans when you walk in, but don't be mislead, they don't have any of them. I won't be returning, and I would suggest Cravin Cajun or Hot n Juicy any day.",

    "text": "We went here like an hour before closing. A late dinner, but it was worth it. My friend ordered fried catfish, and it tasted good. We all ordered shrimps. The shrimps were fat and juicy. It is making my mouth water just remembering it. I ordered one pound of shrimp with all the sauces and garlic. Then for round two I ordered another pound of shrimp with all the sauces but half garlic and hot and spicy. The hot and spicy had that good burn. When you first eat the hot and spicy shrimp, you think it's alright but then the after burn kicks in. I love it. When I was done, I was sweating up a storm. It is like I ran 2 miles in 80 degree weather, and I'm skinny and a runner. I just alternated with the garlic and spicy, so my tongue won't fall off.    The place is good. Good location. Big parking lot. Friendly workers. You can write on the wooden walls. We even saw a drawing of Manning Pac Man on the wall.",

My record so far is two pounds of crawfish, a blue crab, a dungeness crab, two potatoes, corn on the cob, half a dozen oysters, and a few french fries. We were there for three or four hours. Never regretted a minute. Such a fun place to hang out and talk with friends. No pressure to roll over the tables or get your order in. Just relax, eat, chat, and have a great time.",

I heard about this place from my cousins in California and recently found out that we have one out here in Vegas. We decided to go here for fathers day dinner and were in for a treat.  The menu was small but it was your basics for seafood. A few varieties of crab to choose from, shrimp, crawfish, oysters, catfish, and for those that don't like seafood they had chicken fingers. What makes it yummy is the options you have for seasonings. I went with the whole shabang for my crawfish and was in heaven. We also ordered fried and raw oysters. I've never had fried oysters so I wasn't sure if I'd like it. As soon as we got the order I tried the fried oyster and it was sooooooooo good. It just melts in your mouth :)  The service was great. Fast and friendly. If you happen to have a sharpie on you, you can decorate certain areas in the booth and around the restaurant. The prices are reasonable and the food is great! I will definitely be back for more :)",

    "text": "Finally I know what the hype is all about! This highly anticipated restaurant opened yesterday and believe me it was worth the wait!  The restaurant is located on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and it's enormous! It was empty when we went because I'm not sure a lot of people know about the opening yet. There are lots of booths and tables. The cool part is that you can vandalize the restaurant! They give you Sharpies and you can write and draw on the walls. They just ask that you keep it PG.  Our waitress was great about explaining the menu to us since we were first timers. I ordered a pound of snow crab legs in the whole she-bang sauce in mild. My husband ordered the same but in medium. The market price today was $14.99. I also got some steamed rice and corn on the cob.  With our sexy bibs on, we opened up our plastic bag and got down and dirty. The crab was succulent and finger-licking good! The corn on the cob was the perfect compliment. I probably would've needed another pound of crab if I didn't have my rice on the side.  Service was top notch. We were checked on regularly. They have good soap and a heavy duty hand dryer which is a must when you eat here.  There's no way to avoid comparing Hot N' Juicy Crawfish to The Boiling Crab. There's something about the sauce at BC that's so good!  Don't get me wrong... Hot N' Juicy is delicious but The Boiling Crab is all that and a bag of well... Crab!",

    "text": "Boiling Crab has some good shrimp and decent oysters.  Oysters were on the smallish side, but the shrimp were nice and plump!  One of the newer seafood spots in town, Boiling Crab lets you order seafood by the pound with your choice of sauce.  I went for the Whole Sha Bang sauce, which is a mix of each individual sauce (garlic, cajun, etc.).  The sauce was certainly garlicky, but it lacked that delicious punch that makes you crave more heat.  When it comes to restaurants like this, it's all about the sauce, and sauce was just alright for me.  As for the restaurant itself, it is spacious and littered with (small) TV's.  Lots of seating available, both tables and booths.  Walking in, it was nice to not be overwhelmed by the smell of their special sauces, probably due to the large space.  During my visit there were several large groups that came by, and there was no issue with seating 20 or so people together.  One interesting thing that we noticed was the amount of wait staff working.  We got there around 4:00pm, and there were about 25 people working.  Based on the amount of customers at that time, everybody could have had their own individual server!  Overall Boiling Crab is a decent spot, but their sauce did not win my heart.",

Lemon pepper & garlic butter are my faves. I really like their clams, mussels, lobster, and Cajun fries. What I'm not a fan of though are their fried foods. I've had their chicken and catfish; both were really kind of tasteless and overly breaded. So, ultimately, if you stay away from their fried foods, you should be A-OK!",

It's for your own good when you start digging into the bucket of sauce and seafood that you ordered.  Get the sha-bang sauce. It'll be the best choice you'll ever make in your life. I usually order it with their fresh shrimp. Add on some sausage that highly complement the sauce which in turn brings out the flavor in them.   And the finishing touch - corn! I know it sounds strange and my dining companion didn't believe me either (he became a devout believer after one bite), but when the buttery sweet corn on the cob is covered with the sauce, there are simply no words to explain the explosion of flavors that makes you think \"wow, I've never had corn like this before!\" That's right, you haven't had corn before boiling crab.",

    "text": "As a Los Angeles transplant living in Las Vegas, I can honestly say that if there's anything I miss most about home, it's Boiling Crab.  Granted, home is only a three+ hour drive away, but when the shabang cravings kick in, life is unbearable.  Ever since they put on their website that a Vegas location was opening soon, I kept counting down the days 'til I'd be reunited with all the goodness that is BC.  My friends (also California natives) and I screamed with joy as we saw that familiar red neon sign that read, \"Lousiana Crawfish\".  I could not stop giggling.  And sure enough, from the moment we walked in, it was like we were home again.  This particular location reminds me a bit of the Rowland location with booths and open areas; but Vegas' open dining area is REALLY big.  It almost felt like a cafeteria.  Lucky for us, we were seated at a booth so we could catch the Eagles/Bears game.  I was tripping out.  I could not believe that I was going to have Boiling Crab in Vegas.  The girls and I knew what we wanted to order ahead of time, and we wasted no time so as to get our food faster:  - 1lb. shrimp shabang non-spicy - 2lbs. shrimp shabang medium - 1lb. clams shabang medium - gumbo w/ rice - catfish w/ mild cajun fries  We figured that if we tried a little bit of everything, we'd be able to make a fair assessment and compare it to the BC's back home.  VEGAS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  All the garlicky goodness of that red shabang sauce was just how I remembered it.  Note: The shabang was really limey in flavor, but I actually enjoyed that better because I didn't have to waste my time squeezing all those tiny limes onto my shrimp.  so nice that the lime essence was magically incorporated in already.  The consistency of the shabang sauce was not as grainy and pasty as I'm used to, but all the right flavors were still there.  Shrimp -- One of my friend's bag was overcooked, but the other friend and I had no complaints about our's.  The medium could have been a bit spicier (since I remember medium being really really spicy), but it was still yummy as ever.  Clams -- Sooo good.  Most of the clam meat fell out of the shells, but that made it taste even better since direct contact with shabang is always best.  Fries -- perfectly cooked; not too spicy.  And not oily at all.  Catfish -- HOLY MOLY.  Flaky and fresh.  It tastes best when you dip it in both ketchup and the tartar sauce.  Gumbo -- Perfectly seasoned AND they had more okra than the Alhambra locations.  My only issue with the gumbo was that there wasn't enough rice or shredded crab bits, but it still rocked my socks.  I tried really hard not to cry, but when food is this good, how can you not tear up a little?  Especially when it's something that reminds me of home -- football games on Sundays, drinking Coronas while you wait for food, good company, friendly service.  Restaurant perfection at its finest.  And I have to address the wait staff.  Although it looked like the place was over-staffed (perhaps preparing for the influx of crazy California transplants like me), the service was awesome as usual.  Everyone was really attentive, super nice, and kept refilling our drinks without our asking even once.  The best part is that when I got home, even though I knew I would reek of shabang goodness, my clothes didn't smell that bad.  Maybe it's because this location is larger and the air circulates better, but that was a change from the places back home haha.  Although as word spreads and it gets more business, I would still recommend wearing casual clothes you don't mind messing up.  Sometime that one shrimp shell misses your bib by a smidgen and you'll wish you hadn't worn your club clothes or taken a first date here.  My only regret is that I didn't bring a Sharpie to commemorate one of the happiest days of my life ... but I'll definitely be back again and again :)  --- one more thing.  I have nothing against Hot 'n' Juicy; but, for all you Vegas natives who have never had Boiling Crab ... I guarantee you'll never see Hot 'n' Juicy the same way again.  BC will always be the one to beat.  (at least in terms of cajun seafood restaurants in areas with a high concentration of Asians)",

I couldn't tell the difference between the sauces (mixed vs individual.. probably cuz of the strong garlic flavor). Shrimp is fairly large in size, gumbo was not bad, sweet potato fries were decent.   The dining area is large and the wait staff was friendly. Parking is accessible as well.

The clams were so fresh, juicy and PLUMP!!! and complemented by the sha-bang sauces, we definitely felt $10 a pound of these clams were a STEAL!   I dont' recommend ordering the crab despite the fact that it's called Boiling Crab because often times, the crab smells and it's not because they're frozen, but because they die and the cooks don't even notice.   Also, don't order the crawfish unless you've never had it before. As most people would say, crawfish meat is probably the size of your pinky and it's not worth the entire bang for your buck.  Order a pound of clams instead. =) I'm still reminiscing how meaty they were!  A couple things about this particular location: It's a large open restaurant but they don't use their floor space very well. By the time it's 7pm, primetime for dinner, many people are standing in line and yet, the restaurant itself still has floor space to put more tables and chairs but the staff doesn't. There's also a lot of bench-seats but they're uncomfortable =/ While these long benches deceivingly look like they could seat a lot of people, those could probably only seat 4 people max especially since you're going to be battling for elbow space as you chicken-pose to prevent the juices from splattering onto your sleeves/clothes!!",

At first I wasn't mad but after opening each leg it got more aggravating. I brought it up to the server and showed them how small the last piece was they said they need to see if all of them were like that. They didn't do anything to fix the crappy feeling I got from eating there.   All in all poor customer bservice and it ruined the experience for me. The clams and the crawfish is much bigger at hot n juicy too.   Dont go to this one. You'll thank yourself.",

    "text": "My expectations were too high for this place. Not to knock the business because I am a fan but it's not the same as the chain in California. Maybe I'm used to fresher seafood, fresh limes, and quality service. The limes were old, the yellow pale look when they have been sitting in the frig too long and it's the last day to use them before you have to throw them out,  I was given those ones. By the 3rd time requesting more limes, we finally got to the more fresher ones, you know the green ones with juice. Anyways, the shrimp and crawfish were over cooked. Paid about $50 for the Alaskan king crab legs which was 1.4lbs, I can live with that cause back home it's about $32 a lb, I'm just guessing it's not as easy to get quality seafood in Vegas. Usually the crab meat is sweet and you don't need anything to eat with it. This time I had to use some old limes to add flavor. Oh and by the way, the bags had little sauce which I am not used to. I will never visit boiling crab in Vegas again, but I will return to my favorite spot in Santa Ana, CA. If anyone wants the experience of what it should really be and the best seafood and flavor go to the one in Santa Ana, it's right next to south coast plaza. Overall, it was an experience to say I've tried it in Vegas and never will again. Kind of disappointed for the money paid but I lived and I learned.",

I've been to Hot & Juicy but I just love coming to Boiling Crab. I love that you can write on the walls and squirt ketchup all over the table. Basically, I have no class.  If you're on a diet, you should not be here fyi.   I'm usually conscious about the price. I usually get water, half pound of the whole shabang mild shrimp with rice and cajun fries and that will typically cost less than $12 and a very full tummy.  The wait time can get pretty long and they do not take reservations. I usually come here within an hour of right when they open and spare myself the wait time.  The staff are generally really nice. I've never had an issue with the waiters, other than it being crazy busy and having to wait a little longer.",

The sauce for my crab and my shrimp were the same (whole shabang medium) but varied greatly in spice and thickness. But maybe they do the sauces differently for different foods?

I get that they bring everything out as it's ready, but I got my shrimp about 20 mins before the last person in my group got their lobster. Even after the wait, the food was worth it.   I had 1 lb of shrimp with the whole sha bang in medium spice. It was so good! The shrimp was big & juicy. I also had some of the raw oysters. Those were okay, but not the best I ever had.   The only thing I disliked about Boiling Crab compared to H&J was that they don't provide gloves. This is rough when you're a female whose nails smells like shrimp the next few days. Other than that, this place is delicious. A must visit for seafood lovers.",

My party of 8 arrived around 4:30pm - 5pm on Saturday afternoon. The wait was around 20 minutes long. The majority of my party ordered \"the bags.\" I had the shrimp, with corn and potatoes. I chose the mild mix of all 3 sauces. It was DELICIOUS, fresh and hot. I only got the 1/2 pound of shrimp but I wish I would have gotten the full pound. I was satisfied but I could have definitely eaten more. Give yourself a break from the strip and visit this place while you are in Vegas.",

Don't worry, they provide you with bibs (I think they have gloves, too, if you ask).   It's mostly seafood here so prices for your shrimp, crab legs, crawfish and such will be market price sold by the pound. Once you choose your seafood, choose your sauce, then your spice level! They're known for their \"whole shabang\" since it's all their favors put together. I normally get that! Weirdly, if I were to go to other restaurants like this (i.e. Hot N Juicy) I order their \"whole shabang\" type sauce, name and all, and I always get the dirty looks... sorry! Their mild is... pretty spicy, so be careful!   Other than that, definitely get the fried oysters! The sauce it comes with is pretty yummy! Cajun fries (you can order lemon pepper fries, too) is a must!   They open a little later so come when they open cus once it's dinner time, the waits get pretty long!",

    "text": "We visited this location after 6pm and it was packed.  Since we were desperately hungry and failed to find parking close enough to the other seafood restaurant we really wanted to try, we decided to order take-out. We ordered a fried shrimp basket, a fried catfish basket, Cajun fries with each and some wings. I thought I was ordering a whole lot of food and hoped we hadn't ordered too much. The wait was about 15 minutes. We grabbed our order and hightailed back to the resort to dig in. Everything was delicious, well seasoned, nice and spicy.  Now the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. We ordered the shrimp and catfish basket separately from the Cajun fries (a side item) yet they were served together with there being much more fries than seafood. Where I'm from, a basket represents a huge serving and we expected a lot of shrimp and a lot of catfish to satisfy 4 people. Each basket contained enough seafood for maybe one person. We made do but will probably dine in rather than take out next time.",

    "text": "Finally a place I'm familiar with!   Venue - I was surprised to see how big this restaurant is because the locations I've been to in California were half the size. It was spacious, clean, had a lot of TVs, and you can choose between a booth or table.  My dad brought me here around 5pm, which is before the dinner rush (around 7pm) and we chose to sit at a table. Our server was Shana and she was very helpful. I knew the menu well, but my dad was a different story. He basically left it up to me to order and Shana was very patient while I asked my dad what he liked.   Order- We ended up with 3lbs of non-spicy shrimp with the whole sha-bang flavor, corn, and some sausage. We split everything down the middle and ended up with another meals worth of left overs. Whoops, I got too excited.  Food - The shrimps were pretty big, easy to peel, and packed with flavor. The sauce wasn't mostly oil - it was thick and filled with a good amount of garlic. To be brutally honest, I got a fat headache and high blood from eating but it might have been from dehydration or because I haven't had a crab boil in a long time. In any case, nothing Tylenol and sleep couldn't fix.  Service - There were a lot of waiters and my water was always filled up...that's something different. Shana also checked up on us once in awhile...definitely non-existent to the other locations I've been to in CA.   Price - Coming from CA, the price of a pound of shrimp in NV is expensive. The bill was a surprise and it would make sense if I was paying more because of the service. This is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars.   Overall - A restaurant with a good atmosphere to just sit, talk, and eat with your hands.",

On top of that, the lemon with salt and pepper. I'm already salivating just thinking about it.    I usually go here in a group of 8 or more. When reserving a table for a party, make sure everyone is present before getting seated. But thank you to the one worker who hooked it up last min! (Forgot your name)   I love boiling crab.

I did have to ask for refills, but that is partially my fault for ordering XXX and drinking like a fish lol.  If you have never eaten at a place like this, the atmosphere is kind of disturbing.  When you walk in, all the tables are covered with scratch paper like they used to do for us in art class when we were 5yrs old.  Everywhere you see, people eating an unimaginable amount of seafood in plastic bags.  And no where to put the shells, except right onto the table next to your food.  I REALLY wish they did the empty bucket thing like at Joes crab shack (not nearly as good food wise, just stating the idea) so that you could discard and keep clean.  Maybe I am pretentious.  So now that I got that outta the way, how is the food?  Must be good to still get the 5 star review lol.  The food is amazing.  The prices are fair, and the sauces are packed with flavor.  I LOVE hot food...I ordered the XXX, and I admit, this was hot.  I will keep my Thai food and others as hot as possible, but this XXX was actually a little distracting...I will order XX from now on.  We always order the \"all of the above\" seasoning, although it becomes a little salty towards the finish line.  The crab is very good, I have tried pretty much all the varieties, as well as the shrimp and crawfish.   I'd probably say I enjoy the shrimp the most.  I really like the corn, how they toss it in the bag with the seafood...best corn ever.  We usually order a basket of fries as well, since they are large enough to share and fill in the gaps between seafood bites.  If you are looking for good seafood, check it out!",

    "text": "This location is HUGE and they have just as large fans to go with the size of the restaurant. Although they don't really need the fans, as mentioned by other reviewers they really crank up the AC so bring a jacket.   We got a little bit of everything in the whole shabang sauce in varying spiciness. My choice is whole shabang medium, just the right amount of kick. We got shrimp, crawfish (frozen), dungenous and snow crab legs. To go with all the seafood we got corn, potatos and sausage. All the food was cooked perfectly and the sauce very flavorful and delicious. My complaint would be that not all the bags were seasoned the same, some were better than others, even between two whole shabang mediums, one was much more flavorful so I ended up just dipping everything in that one bag. The corn was a big hit as well, the potatos are definite fillers, but good for dipping into more sauce. The sausage should be a pass, it was dry, even after sitting at the bottom of the grease seasoning bag, maybe it was old or just not good but I rather spend the money on more corn next time.  Overall this one lives up to the Boiling Crab hype and all the food was very good.",

    "text": "I prefer the food at Hot N Juicy, but the atmosphere/interior of the Boiling Crab is tops (at least compared to the original HNJ location, I haven't been to their new location yet).  The shrimp (about $10 a pound) was large. They still had their heads on, which can make for a memorable experience. I ripped one off and all the brains and extra stuff exploded all over me. Luckily I had their plastic bib on. The king crabs were excellent (roughly $25 per pound). It's tough to ever be disappointed with king crabs as long as their not overcooked. We got the whole sha-bang with both. That's a mixture of all their seasonings -- rajun cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic pepper. I loved how they had chunks of garlic in there. It made for a great dipping sauce. We also got corn and potatoes. Dip that stuff in the sauce and cover in garlic and you'll be in heaven.  The place is huge. Plenty of tables, chairs and booths and TVs everywhere. It's a great place to watch football or just hang out with a group. They get extra points for having HD, unlike HNJ, where the reception was nothing but static.",

I didn't get her name, but she along with the other ladies working were great! I went with a group of friends and we took the BC virginity of 2 of them. Let me just say that after they took their first bite, they were not disappointed! For me the food was delicious. I ordered a Corona with lime to make the pound of shrimp taste even better!   If you've never been to BC before I always order 1 lb. shrimp, whole shebang, medium with a corn! Absolutely delicious! Also get some Cajun fries too!

Deciding that we would save the experience for another night led us to try Blooming Spot Mini Pot around the corner - that's another story and a good find too!  Always having it in the back of my mind I got into a conversation with a fellow co-worker about this crawfish crazed place. I also noticed it had two locations on Spring Mountain Rd. so they must be doing something right. He convinced me to skip the hype and go straight for the Boiling Crab. I had already visited Crab Corner so I figured it was going to be similar in style.  I call our night at the Boiling Crab, \"Crustaecean Annihilation\". It was great! We had a pound of crawfish and shared a dungeoness Crab - he was massive!  The place is spacious. not like its counterpart. There are plenty of televisions around the room with lots of sports, news, etc. Something's on for everyone if that's your speed. There are different styles of seating, long bench or more intimate booths. Great place for groups!  The cajun flavoring was perfect and the spice level was exactly how it was promised. You choose from various sauces served and then you choose your spice level. The crustaceans are delivered to your table in a plastic bag with it seeped in the juices and flavors you chose. You eat straight out of the bag right on the table. No plates or cutlery at this place. Feast hardcore, hands in. Start cracking and sucking away. I almost licked the bag it came in. ALMOST!  Service was a little shotty, our waitress was all over the place. But this fact simply can be overlooked as she was sweet and had good intentions for the most part.  If you shy away from eating the shellfish suckers, they even offer seafood gumbo, fried fish choices and nice sides like sweet potato fries, corn etc. It's a fun experience for all age groups. And its super casual and fairly priced.  Don't wear your Sunday best here and let them tie that bib on cause you'll need it!!",

I ordered the whole shebang of a pound of shrimp, a pound of mussels, some corn, cajun fries and fried calamari.  I waited 30 minutes to get my carryout.  Another guy was there and they told him his order wouldn't be ready for another hour and told him he could come back to pick it up. Okaaaay.  $39 bucks later, I drove back to Mandalay Bay.  Upon opening the boxes, the fries were congealed together and COLD.  The rings of calamari were also cold.  I'm not talking \"drove from BC to MB and lost some of the heat\" temperature, I am talking COLD.  I am willing to bet my fries and calamari sat on a counter for 20 of those 30 minutes.  I do like the concept of BC, but I believe I'm done.",

As he was serving us the drinks, he accidentally spilled the whole tray of 4 sodas on the table which spilled onto my brother in law and my sister and their baby. And all the manager could do was pay for the dry cleaning... Really? Dry cleaning? Who wants to come back and give you a dry cleaning bill? The waiter was super apologetic and well you know, sh!zzz happens. At least comp the sodas that spilled on your guests and maybe come over to the table to see if everything was ok.

It's a huge, open establishment that requires you to \"get down and dirty\" when you eat -- which means no utensils (unless you've ordered the gumbo), no trash buckets, bibs around your neck and no gloves.  They have plastic \"finger tips\" to put over your fingers, but they didn't really work for us.  Both the crawfish and snow crab legs were amazing, succulent, AND fresh.  The whole shebang sauce makes it all worthwhile!  If you don't order more than 2 pounds, you have to buy your corn, potatoes, and sausages separately.  The cajun fries were also tasty and came in a large, made to share order.  Ask for limes and salt'n'pepper -- they give you a generous amount!  The service was quick, efficient, and friendly during both of the times we dined here.  Even though it was a madhouse on Saturday during dinner, our food came out within 10 minutes!  P.S. Don't wear nice clothes if you plan to come here! P.P.S. Wash your hands with limes and let it soak for at least 1-2 minutes if you want to get the seafood/cajun smell out of your hands!",

I always get 2lbs crawfish with the Cajun sauce, 2lbs shrimp with Cajun sauce, side of jasmine rice, potatoes, half pound of sausage, and corn. This is more than enough to feed 3 girls. I spent a total of $53 not bad.   They give u a bib so you don't get dirty. No plates necessary just eat out the bag. The food is so flavorful! I don't recommend eating here before a date or going to the club. Service is always great whenever I'm here. I would recommend this place to everyone who loves seafood.",

Stumbled upon B/C just a day or so ago while vacationing in Vegas and I darn near cut everyone on Flamingo off to swerve across lanes *(yes that was me guys - it was my stomach doing the driving - I'm sorry)...  I was completely taken back upon walking in and seeing that there was NO WAIT. Are you kidding me??? This would NEVER happen in Cali'!!!  The service and food were both amazing (although the restroom could've used a bit of attention). The cherry on top would be the fact that I didn't leave or wake up the following day w/ a stomach ache!  Yaaaz!!!  Las Vegas - Boiling Crab, you have OFFICIALLY exceeded my expectations!!!!!",

It looked and felt like they were not half a pound because each of us only got 8 or 9 shrimps. Last time I came here, I got at least 15. I also ordered cajun fries which took forever to come out. They first mistook my cajun fries for cajun wings. Once that issue was solved, we were done with our shrimp way before the fries even arrived.   Our waitress, Jessica, was also very rude. She didn't understand that each of us wanted our checks split. Instead of asking what each of us ordered so she can split our checks, she said, \"Well, I don't know what everyone ordered so I'll have to figure that out.\" ......Shouldn't she have asked us what we ordered instead of rudely exclaiming that she doesn't know?  From now on I will be going to Hot N Juicy!",

You name it they already placed it on your table, refill they check on you before you realize you needed one. As much as I hate waiting this is the one place I don't mind controlling myself and pushing my patience dial up so I stay still until it's my turn. I will never cheat on them again like I did the one day I tried \"hot..\", I rather wait and pay a little more any day of the year!! Thank you so much for being amazing and putting up with me even on my brat days where I'm \"h-angry\" haha, yes that word does exist atleast in my dictionary!

We always get pounds of shrimp with the whole sha-bang flavor in mild. this time we tried their oysters(12pcs) for the first time, there was 5 of us, 3 of us loves oysters, 1 haven't tried oysters and 1 who doesn't eat oysters. when they brought the oysters to our table, it didn't looked too appetizing but we wanted to give it a try, this is boiling crab!!! it's gotta be good! so the 3 who loves oysters grab 1 each(im one of them). it was nasty, don't know what's wrong with it, but it was nasty, so I told my buddy(who haven't tried oysters) not to eat it! but me and two of my friends who loves oysters thought that maybe the first one was just a bad one, NOPE!!! the oysters are really nasty so we figured that we should send it back. and they did took it back, then I told my friends I was going to wash my hands but I just wanted to see the managers reaction towards the returned oysters and all I saw was he was shaking his head and he is acting like he is disappointed(he didn't see me, I was standing on the side going towards the restroom. anyway, I thought \"nothing he can do, it was really bad\" then when the bill came in, they only deducted half the price of the oysters(I guess cause we ate 6 out of 12). it wasn't the price that irritated me, it was the act of charging us on the food that was nasty. so before we left, I talked to the waiters(3 of them), I wanted to get their opinion on something, I asked them \"if you are eating on a restaurant and the food wasn't good and you sent it back, should you be charged for the meal?\" here is there answer \"it depends, if you took a bite, then maybe you shouldn't be charged, but if it's the whole thing, you should be\" this was my reply(in a very polite manner) \"now let me ask you guys this question, how do you eat oysters? do you take a bite or do you slurp the whole thing?\" they answered that they eat the whole thing. My point is,   they made it looked like we are just trying to get free food. it was a pretty bad experience. I usually tell everybody I know that I prefer boiling crab over hot and juicy. not anymore. goodluck with your business, whoever is the manager at that time didn't make the right call. he may have been having a bad day or whatever but he still made a mistake. todays date is November 14, 2017 we ate dinner around 9:20pm til 10:00pm. this is an honest review, I still love your shrimp, but I think we will be going back to hot and juicy. I'm sorry for the very long review, I was just frustrated.",

After we were seated by our host, we took sometime to order food because we were skeptical about what to order. Being our first time but the host kept on asking us if we were ready all the time when we frankly told her to give us some time to think about it. Then after our food was was ready we asked twice for more lemons and more salt because our host forgot to bring us some when we asked. The service was somewhat pressured and I didn't find it to pleasing. I felt they were annoyed of us for asking for more hot sauce and lemons. Other than that the food was delicious. The oysters, crab legs and crawfish were tasty. I want to go back but maybe try another location.",

My brother and I shared a lb. of medium spicy shrimp with the whole shabang sauce, a pound of medium spicy clams with the rajun cajun sauce, cajun fries, and a side of rice. We ended up spending $30, and we left the restaurant hungry.   We probably had around 20 clam shells in our bag but only about 8 had meat inside. It was quite disappointing. However, I enjoyed the bold and spicy flavor of the rajun cajun seasoning, so I poured it all over my rice. The portion of the shrimp was a bit more generous (we got about 15 pieces? for the pound), but I didn't enjoy the whole shabang seasoning (tasted like ketchup to me). And the cajun fries were way too salty.   All in all, it was just ok. I had skyrocket expectations for this place, because my friends hyped it up so much. Unfortunately, those expectations fell immensely short. But I'm sure that I will give it another try sooner or later. In the meantime, I'd rather spend a couple more bucks and pig out right across at Makino. Or feast at the Orleans buffet (they have plenty of louisiana/southern and cajun inspired food)   *Btw, did anybody count how many TVs this restaurant has?",

Service - awesome! Although the place is humongous, everyone is attentive and they always check up on you. They also don't make a big fuss about splitting checks with big parties. I know it's a hassle, but they've always been accommodating and say it's not a problem.     Food - yum! I think I've had almost everything on the menu and nothing's disappointed me. I always get the whole shabang medium and it's the perfect amount of butter, garlic, and spice. I hate getting messy, but the sauce is finger licking good. Shrimp is nice and plump. King crab is meaty! Crawfish isn't my thing, too much work for such little meat. Oysters are fresh and sweet! All their fried stuff is super crispy, just the way I like it. Like their Cajun & sweet potato fries and Cajun chicken wings. The wings were bigger than expected.  Atmosphere - I like the openness to it. They play good music, there's so many TVs, and they accommodate large groups. It gets loud and pretty busy, but I like that about Boiling Crab.   Come here to eat, socialize, and get dirty",

Especially since it's just opened and quite a few of my friends haven't tried it yet.  Ate her for a friends birthday and there was more than enough room and, shockingly, no wait for 13 people. Unfortunately, like all \"local Filipinos\" everyone was late. Our 7:30 arrival time turned into 8:30. Those of us that were early wanted to sit but, had to wait for half of our party to be seated. Needless to say, I was starving when we were seated.  In the mean time, the three of us that were there were marking up the wooden seats and walls with a pen; as BC welcomes the graffitti.  When we were seated, we quickly got our drinks and orders in. Fast and friendly service. The waitress was patient in all my friends questions, as it was their first time. She was also able to separate checks which is always good in large parties.  Great thing about large parties is I got to try dishes I've never tried before. Got to samps the cajun fries and catfish. Woooot, that was some guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud filet of catfish!",

Very welcoming for large groups. The staff was enthusiastic and helpful for those of us first timers.  Prices were reasonable for all the food that was brought out.  The crab in a bag idea seems like a good one, but for me it was too messy. My hands were so greasy and buttery that I could hardly crack my crab. I understand seafood requires a bit more work and possible mess, but having to reach into a bag of buttery/garlicy crab legs was too much. Even though others in my party were messy, it just made me feel awkward.  I think a great place to try, but I would rather have my food served on a plate, than in a bag...",

This is some damn good stuff! The messiness, the flavors having a party on my beloved taste buds. Is this a dream????  The Good: -Everything! -Fast service unless you order crab (But who wants undercooked crab? ) -Originality  -Great priced brews -Lots and lots of TV's for the games  The Bad: -Not one thing!   I always order either the King Crab or Shrimp with half a pound of sausage, 2 corn on the cobs, a side of white rice, and Cajun fries (Medium). This place never fails! If you like spicy like I do, go for the XXX. I'll admit that the spice dominates the actual flavor of the food so it's better to go medium and actually enjoy your meal. This is my favorite restaurant and not too many people in Vegas know about it. I've turned numerous co-workers into lovers now! Trust me when I say you will not go wrong here. This place is EPIC!",

I saw others eating the LBs of seafood with your hands etc and although im sure its good, i just don't see the draw of having to go through so much work to eat my food. I kept it super simple and ordered the Chowder with Rice ($8), and a side of seasoned fries ($4). I should have looked at the photos first as the chowder came out in a small take out style container, and didn't even look to be enough for a full serving for an adult. It was decent but nothing that made me need to have it again in my life. The fries were a good serving size to share with others and the seasoning was tasty, as well as a good crispy fry which i like. All in all i can't say it was a bad meal but it wasn't a meal i need to rush back and have again. Call me spoiled but they say you eat first with your eyes and then your taste buds, the paper bowl for my soup wasn't super appealing. I also tried the calamari rings at the table and i expect them to be frozen rings but these tasted very processed. Sorry i cannot talk this place up like the masses...",

If you visit here anyday other than holidays they usually seat you within 10-15 minutes.  To me, waiting for a table is the worst and at H&J the place is sooo small you are guaranteed to have to wait easily over 30 min.  I know Hot & Juicy opened another location down the street, but I've never had a reason to check it out.  Disclaimer is that the service at BC is hit or miss ... sometimes it's great and other times you wonder if you paid already because you haven't seen your server in forever.  My advice if you want some good crabs crawfish and shrimp ... don't wait ... choose boiling crab and get the whole SHA-BANG",

As you are being seated, the hostess tears a sheet of plastic tablecloth to prepare you for the mess that will ensue! Here's what 4 guys ordered:  2lbs Shrimp 2lbs King Crab  1lb Sausage 4 Corn on the Cob 2 Potatoes (6 pcs.) 2 Steamed Rice  We went with the Whole Sha-Bang (Cajun, Garlic, Lemon Pepper) flavor Mild. The Mild flavor still has a slight kick to it and I've been told that the Medium is fairly spicy. In any event, you can pass the time waiting for your order to come out by squeezing the limes into the salt-pepper cups creating a refreshingly tasty dipping sauce. The service is spot on as the bags of seafood and side orders are delivered efficiently to the table.   Once the food arrives, roll up your sleeves and go at it with your hands! For the seafood, I would recommend dipping it back into the bag for additional flavor and alternating with the lime-salt-pepper dipping sauce. The king crab had to be the table favorite. The rice, potatoes and corn provide a nice balance to the flavors of the Whole Sha-Bang. The sausage also provides a nice change of pace to the seafood.   Overall, I really enjoyed being able to get down and dirty with my food even as far as eating the rice with my hands. This place has definitely gotten my attention and has snuck into my \"must have\" list when I visit vegas!",

No.   The menu is small and pretty straight forward.  All the items listed as market price are written on a dry erase board at the counter, which makes sense since the prices constantly changes. Either the claims or shrimp (cant remember which) price is now a $1 more per pound which they tell you right away as you sit down at the table since the menu hasn't been updated with the price change.  No biggie.  The only down fall is there isn't a kid's menu.  Most people this isn't an issue, but it was for us.  At first I was disappointed no kid items but saw a fried shrimp baskets...problem solved.  Well...not so much.  The batter it is fried in is seasoned and gives off a spicy flavor.  I tried one and I thought it was a little spicy, nothing too bad but it can be too much for a child.  Especially if they don't do spicy.  They basket was $10 so we basically paid $10 for a basket of fries.    I ordered a 1lbs of claims in the whole-shabang mild, hubby got shrimp in the whole-shabang medium.  After a few bites I realized mild was a little more than mild.  It was delicious but my husband tried mine and he said he couldn't tell the difference between his medium and my mild.  Either mine was more than mild or his medium was a big disappointment in the seasoning area.  Overall I would say this place is okay and we would go back, but next time without the kiddo.",

Me and my brother got 2lbs of snow crab legs, a pound of shrimp, 4 corn, and sweet potato fries!  Both the shrimp and crab were cooked well.  However, the key is in the Cajun sauce that  the shrimp and crab are cooked in.  The flavors were on point!  I preferred shelling the shrimp and crab legs first and then dipping it back into the Cajun sauce. Yum!  We got the medium spice sauce which was actually pretty hot.  The heat builds up over time, so if you're not used to eating hot or spicy food, I would suggest you order the mild version.  The price was a little high as our total bill costed a little over $60 for 2 people.  However,  the quality did match the price.  You definitely get what you pay for.  The waitresses were also friendly and accommodating.   Thus, it was a great experience and i would definitely recommend this spot.",

    "text": "Talk about flavor! I got the shrimp which is $11.99/lb, $5.99/half lb. Man was it good. Got it medium spicy and I enjoy spicy but think their hat meter is the Thai one b/ c it was about twice a medium imo It started to make my noise run toward the end of the batch. One thing that makes them lose a star is that you don't get the option of the plastic gloves like at some of their competitors. Definitely don't get any of this stuff in your eye. Aside from that it's definitely worth a visit. You won't be let down. The ambience is cool. They had great music selection playing the entire time we were there from good hip hop to quality edm. The workers are laid back. There's a lot of TV's. The walls are all kinda scribbled on. Pretty fun to look at. Will be coming back, that's for sure. Maybe we'll byog next visit",

Shrimp at the store costs about 7 bucks a pound vs the 13 or so they charge you here. I do feel like their sauces have gotten a lot more oily with time but this could just be in comparison to their California locations. Service is good, sometimes wait times to be seated and for food can take a while.",

    "text": "This review is for the Las Vegas location. Sunday afternoon at 1pm the wait was FIVE MINUTES. Those of you who frequent any of the other locations know how crazy this is. FIVE. MINUTES. ! .  The only reason its not 5 stars is the weird up-sell on everything. We initially tried to order a half lb of mussels (something not offered at the Koreatown location), a lb of Lobster, a half lb of snow crab for my 9 year old (he likes non-spicy so has to have a separate order). The snow crab is a minimum 1lb order. Okay... the mussels too... okay.... the lobster is a whole lobster and they are 2-3 lbs each (so I guess the minimum order for lobster is 2 lbs). Sighhhh.   So our final order : 1lb snow crab and half lb shrimp in non spicy for the child. He loved it, no complaints. (And actually, he ate it all.) 1 lb mussels, 1 lb king crab, half lb shrimp, potatoes and corn in mild for us. Cajun fries. with so much food I had to skip the gumbo, there's no way we could have finished it. 2 beers rounded off or order (Shocktop Apple). The food was delish! One exception, the mussels. They just didn't absorb the seasoning, I ate one and decided they weren't worth the calories. My advice is to skip them and go for the gumbo instead.  The service was slow for accessories (crackers, forks, butter, ketchup), and quick for the food.",

    "text": "It was love at first sight with The Boiling Crab. They're a perfect example of the gems to be found if you're willing to stray away from the flashing lights, inflated prices and pretentiousness of the Strip.  It's amazing that they can offer you a full pound of seafood with potatoes and corn for under $30. One seafood boil (bag) feeds two.  Pick your sauce and your level of so iciness and you're set. Personally I think you're missing out if you do anything other than the Whole Shabang sauce. And beware because the \"medium\" level spicy is deceiving because it's actually really hot! If you're unsure, get part of your sides marinated in a hotter sauce and dip in as you like.  Service is always warm and friendly and there are enough screens here that you won't miss a moment of the game. Great for crowds and families yet you won't feel uncomfortable coming here on a date.  I absolutely love this place.",

    "text": "I would say this is a hidden gem but based on the massive amount of cars in the parking lot for this place, it's a well known gem for most seafood fans in the Las Vegas area.  First Tip: Wear casual clothes that you won't mind if they get ruined.  This was my first time here and my wife and I were unaware of the \"get up in it\" hands approach of dining so we were dressed inappropriately.  I wore one of my favorite polo's and she wore white pants...tsk tsk.  Luckily, my polo made it out unscathed.  Her pants.....we won't mention.  Second Tip: Leave the jewelry at home. It just gets in the way of truly enjoying all of the flavors when you're eating like a cave-person.  No forks or knifes to be seen.  Third Tip: They only serve Beer and Wine due to not having their liquor license so be prepared.  You can however bring your own bottle of wine for a small corkage fee.  They offer a decent selection of beers.  We went with bottles of Corona and the (canned) IPA.  The server was fantastic and we were with people who dined there before so they did all the ordering.  All I remember hearing was a lot of \"1 LB. Shrimp She-Bang\" and \"Spicy She-Bang Sausage\".  After a short wait, the server would deliver a plastic bag filled with your protein of choice swimming in the most delectable sauce I've tasted.  The bag o' sausage had chunks of garlic that had me sticking my dirty paws back in repeatedly.  The server then brought us boardwalk fries dusted with Old Bay (just the way I like them).  Over the course of the meal, we had tried the Dungeness crab, king crab legs, shrimp, lobster, fries and sausage.  Every item ordered was a huge win. Can't wait to go back, but this time we will be prepared.  I plan on dining with sweat pants and a painter's smock.",

I feel like I usually get more for a smaller price elsewhere. The extra hot is something I can handle! I thought I remember it being a lot spicier. Their sauce is a little more on the oily side then some places I've been to but still very flavorful! As for the seafood we got - snow crab, clams, and shrimp. All were very good and I'm glad they were fresh and not over cooked. Can't wait to make a trip back here when I visit again.",

The location is convenient to me and the wait isn't usually too long. Although you could get stuck during dinner rush and the wait could be about 20-30 minutes.   I always order the same thing. A pound of shrimp, mild, the whole shebang and Cajun fries. Sometimes I'll have rice instead of fries. I used to order medium but it got way too spicy for me that I couldn't enjoy my meal! So now I always stick with mild. There had been a couple times when the shrimp was a little overlooked, which made it extremely hard to peel, but that doesn't happen too often. I've also tried their oysters which are pretty darn fresh.   I will continue to come to boiling crab for as long as they're open!",

The fried oysters are my favorite, they are crispy and come with dipping sauce that I believe is a mixture of ketchup and Tabasco. I've been eating here since 2015 so the only down side to this place is that their prices have increased dramatically on some items. So if you're coming with family like I always do, its pricey.",

Besides the wait time (hr.) the overall experience was great!  I order the Shrimp Cajun mild with potatoes (3pcs.) and a bowl of rice Mmm' so delicious. Everything came out great and on time. Definitely waaaay better than Hot N' Juicy.  Service was friendly but not attentive. It was super busy so I'll give it a pass.  I'll be back.   I do wonder why there's only one location ?",

    "text": "First visit and I wanted to give myself a day to really think about this, before giving a two star review. They use MSG, and they use a lot of it!   The food was good (while we were eating) but by the time my party got to the car--two of us were suffering immediate allergic reactions. By the time we got home, all of us didn't feel good. It's been 24 hours since we ate and I'm still sick. Massive headache, dehydration, itchy, red skin etc. Every symptom I get, when I'm exposed to high levels of MSG.   Besides that, The restaurant in general is really odd. It has a plank wood interior (cool idea, you feel like you should be eating fish when you're in there) but most of it is covered in graffiti. There are signs everywhere that they're doing a renovation. There are warnings on paper signs saying that if you write on the \"clean wood\",  you will be fined or in trouble etc. There's also a big sign that says you will be prosecuted if you \"dine and dash\". There are security cameras facing every table and hired security at the door. What am I at nightclub? Am I missing something here? Very unusual thing to see at a restaurant like that. They obviously have issues with something. Not going to revisit to find out what.   We had to wait a while to sit even though the place wasn't crowded by any means.   The only food issue we had was with the clams, there was one clam to every 3 shells in the bag. Weird. Don't rip people off, it's not cool.   The only other crawfish restaurant I've been to, is hot and juicy. I think we are definitely going to stick to what we know and not return to the boiling crab. Sorry guys, it's not worth getting sick over.   It's petty but I have to mention because I am a woman that spends a lot of money on my nails.... They don't carry gloves. I know it might be traditional to eat with your bare hands, but not everybody want to get that dirty.   The reason why I gave two stars instead of one was because the food was pretty good, we just was nice but other than that.... big no. Maybe take the food to go if you like MSG... if not, go elsewhere!",

This is a very casual restaurant, so I wasn't expecting fancy, and upon my arrival everything seemed fine. We were greeted and given a reasonable estimate on when we could expect to get our table, we got our drinks, and shortly our table was ready. Then the black half of our party arrived the entire evening changed. Suddenly we could no longer get our drink orders, our sides, even a simple request for drawn butter somehow turned into a major production requiring lengthy waits and excuses  I am embarrassed and absolutely livid and were it not for the very people you didn't want to serve telling me to let it go, you and everyone around would have heard about it tonight. Rest assured that the owners will be hearing a lot more about this tomorrow.  And to our waiter, you screwed yourself out of a good tip.",

I've tasted around their menu and everything that isn't fried has the option of a few different seasonings and spice levels. I'm a heat freak and love hot food, so I always go with the hottest option and the spice known as \"The Whole She-bang\". This is as season mix of all the other season options they offer. I love getting the craw-dads (or mud bugs if you are from another region) and snow crab legs. Everything here is market price so don't be surprised by the price. Their cajun fries are absolutely amazing too. I've also tried the deep fried catfish and the crust was perfectly done. not greasy, light and moist juicy fish on the inside.

    "text": "So, being a DMVer, when my brother suggested we go to the boiling crab to get the best blue crabs, I hesitantly went...it's almost like asking a West Coaster to go to Five Guys for the best burger ever.  When I got there, I found several things interesting:  1. First, they bib you.  Yes, you get a bib, but they'll put it on you.  I thought it was novel until I got a pair of boobs mashed into the back of my head and was forced to pretend not to like it due to the sour face my wife was making.  2. The place it wide open.  It's like eating at a crab feast.  Only, with restaurant prices.  3. Everything comes out in a bag.  No dishes.  Just bags with your food in it.  So those were the interesting parts.  Here are the parts I didn't like:  1. They ran out of Dungeness crabs.  Um, you're called the boiling crab.  I expect you to have crabs if your name indicates you're a crab joint.  2. When selling the blue crabs, they sell by weight.  Not by the bushel like I'm used to.  3. It's too loud - between the TV noise and the other diners, I could barely chalk this up as a restaurant experience.  So, I wouldn't be back if I can help it.  Of course, I admit that I am a bit of a crab snob since being the near the Chesapeake, I can get crabs when I want, in the quantity I want, all drenched in Old Bay.  The combination sauce they have there is not bad, but I liked it better on the shrimp and not the crabs themselves.  C'est la vie.",

Coming from the neighborhood of where Boiling Crab came from, this Boiling Crab tastes exactly the same. :] So here are my recommendations for you first timers:  1. SHRIMP: (best bang for your buck) and get it in the WHOLE SHABANG (cajun style sauce). Remember to make your lemon juice, salt and pepper sauce so you can dip the shrimp in.   2. CORN: may be small but it'll help you feel better that you ate some veggies and it tastes great.   3. SWEET POTATO FRIES: sweet, golden crispy fries... so good.   Yes, you don't need to buy that $$$crab just because it says it in the name of the restaurant. Just go for the shrimp and a great/messy time eating. :] YUMMIES!! Awesome, young service. You wont regret it.  Oh, and grab those oysters when you feel like it. So FRESH.",

    "text": "Short version: If you like Hot 'n' Juicy Crawfish, but hate the cramped dining room and horrible parking, check out the Boiling Crab. It's like HJC with 4x the dining room space and decent parking.  Long version: I went here with some friends because I heard of its similarities to HJC, and didn't feel like the crapshoot of getting a table in a decent amount of time or finding parking at HJC. It was 5 of us plus my infant son.  Seating: We were seated almost immediately, even though the place was almost entirely full. It was a table for 4, with a 5th seat added to one end and a highchair added to the other. Slightly cramped, but we were going to share everything family-style, so no big deal. As is typical with these types of places, the table setting is a plastic sheet with no settings or utensils. Oddly, though, there was a napkin dispenser instead of a roll of paper towels. The napkin dispenser ran out 2/3 of the way through dinner and had to be replaced, and I can't help but think a paper towel roll would've served better.  Food: We ordered: 2 lbs of shrimp, \"whole shebang\" sauce/medium spice 2 lbs of snow crab legs, one with lemon pepper/medium, one with shebang/mild 2 lbs of king crab legs, cajun spice/mild 1 lb of clams, Shebang/xxx (maximum spicy) 1 order of fried catfish with fries 1 order of sweet potato fries  The shrimp was a great appetizer for the table and a great way to gauge the flavor of the sauce and the level of spice. The shrimp were large, the sauce was very tasty, and it gave us a good baseline for spice levels.  The crab legs were all excellent, although the king crab was definitely the most flavorful. I'd rate the sauces: 1. shebang, 2. cajun, 3. lemon pepper.  The clams were meaty and delicious. The xxx spice level was a nice surprise, as it actually packed a decent punch. As I liked spicy the most at the table, I ended up eating most of these - everyone tried one, and enjoyed the flavor, but most didn't want to deal with that much heat.  I'm not a huge catfish person, but the fried catfish was decent. The sweet potato fries didn't have any extra seasoning, but I preferred them to the cajun fries.  Also, as this type of place serves the food in the bag of sauce, it's messy as all hell. Your hands will smell like seafood for hours afterward, no matter how much you wash. Price you pay for delicious seafood flavor.  Service: The place was busy, but a few different servers ended up dropping off food and refilling drinks. Overall they were prompt and courteous, although for some reason they served the catfish and fries about 5 minutes after the shrimp and about 10 - 15 minutes before any of the crab or clams. Kind of odd timing on that.  Overall: Loved the food, loved not having to wait 45 minutes for a table, loved the availability of parking. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Consider this review a 3.5 because I did enjoy my meal here. We tried a bit of everything when we came here with a fairly big group.  The fried catfish is hearty and they sure as hell don't skimp on portions. You could easily be full off of that alone, especially with the fries, which are pretty decent.  We decided to order some shrimp as well as crawfish because we knew how frustrating peeling away those crawfish all night could be. When it comes to seasoning your crustaceans, I highly recommend \"the whole shebang\", which is a mixture of all their seasonings thrown together. I found the sauce absolutely delectable and was practically slurping it up off of my side of the table. The crawfish are...well...crawfish, which means that they can be difficult to peel apart for that tasty meat. It helped that I had my dexterous girlfriend with me who helped peel much of the critters for me. The shrimp were juicy and easy to eat but I definitely preferred the flavor of the crawfish. Try squeezing some lime in there for added flavor.  I walked away from the meal feeling rather full and bloated and licking the sauce off my fingers. It's good food but I just can't bring myself to give them the 4 star rating. Something is missing-- maybe it's just that hint of authenticity that you look for in real cajun cooking. But at the end of the day, I do endorse this franchise as worthy of your business. Eating here is a lot more fun than going to TGIF's or Applebee's and you'll want to come back and repeat the experience soon.",

I love seafood and I don't mind gettin my hands filthy with spices and butter. And here they are generous with both.  The shrimp are my favorite, but you can get clams, oysters, crablegs, of course crawfish,  and whatever seasonal seafood they've got. You can pick a sauce. I like the whole shebang but the garlic and hot are also good.  Go here before you decide to go to Red Lobster or God forbid, Joe's Crap (that glorious typo stays) Shack.   The food here is tasty and the atmosphere is chill. I like coming here.",

I looks like a chain restaurant you'd find in Texas such as in Arlington or anywhere in the DFW Metroplex. This \"spicy\" is not as spicy as one would like, and the \"non-spicy\" (for the kids) does have some spice to it.   \"Big\" issue for me was they didn't have brewed iced tea! Fountain tea is crap (and who really drinks that anyway???)  Service was not the greatest, even for what it was. Waitress tended to disappear and never looked at her tables in case people needed something. She didn't really seem to know the food having trouble answering basic questions (\"spicy like those spicy doritos\"... really??)  Hot-n-Juicy is still better all the way around. Doubt we'll go back.",

Chicken tenders were also great! When we were there, on February 21st 2012, the place could not serve alcohol so a dozen of us went and got some beer across the parking lot and brought it in the restaurant.  You can also write a message or note on their walls (wood? plywood?)    I can handly spicy but their mild was quite eye blinking and \"huhhhuhh\" mouth opening.",

I've been to BC Koreatown and BC Alhambra in CA but didn't go to either one of them during spring break so that I could try the BC in Vegas.    First pro to this BC is that there's free + lots of parking. (BC K-town is valet and street parking free after 6pm.  BC Alhambra has street parking but hard to find)  The space surprised me because the BC K-Town and Alhambra are TINY!  Those two combined would only be half the size of BCLV!  I loved the spaciousness and that each table had a tv BUTTTTTTT!!!!! Service was horrible!  BC K-Town is ALWAYS busy (there's a huge line of people waiting in line before the place even opens) but BCLV barely had anyone and yet, my server spent more time at one table full of girls than my table.  I'm sure serving a table full of girls is more fun than serving a couple but honestly, he didn't even stop by to see if we needed a refill...and my boyfriend had his cup RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE TABLE!    The food was okay.  It was too watery/ somewhat bland compared to K-town and Alhambra so I was a little disappointed.    After we were done eating, the server was still busy serving the girls that we had to get up and get the receipt ourselves..He probably didn't even know we left.  NO TIP..& will stick to BCs in Cali",

    "text": "Ok, ok, so I didn't think this place would live up to all hype and I did not think that they could back up everything that all the people were saying. But I am gracious in defeat (especially when it comes to food).   I still haven't been to Hot n Juicy (I know, right, what kind if Yelper am I?) so I don't have anything to compare it to that i have been to recently, but I love seafood and I am from the South so any place boasting Southern cuisine I already have to give the benefit of the doubt.    We walked into the restaurant and were immediately greeted by the hostess (very hospitable, very southern, haha), and the rest of the staff was warm and friendly as well, made me feel like I was in a restaurant at home.  The space was very large, almost warehouse feeling, we had a seat in the middle of the place since we had a large party.  Jennifer was our server and she was a gem!  She talked us through the menu and gave us our options, I ended up going with a pound of shrimp with the whole shabang and some fried catfish. The shrimp came out fast and piping hot!  The catfish was cooked very well, tender and flakey, not overcooked and very succulent.  Like I said in the beginning I had to eat my words and I'll gladly do it again!   I do have to warn you though, if you do the shrimp with the garlic and all the seasoning, you will smell like GARLIC for a day or so, no matter how much you shower, haha, so make sure you and yours are eating the same thing, then she can't complain if you both smell the same, haha",

I am not huge fan of seafood but I won't say no to dungeness crab. I guess what strike me is the hot sauce. So after all that wonderful photos yelper unloaded thank you very much I ordered, too much, then I become addicted to it. I have no car so I have taxi every time in town to the place and back. Its so exhausting and costly even make me tried Buffet in  Caesar palace hoping its also very good so I can have an alternative. No luck, the cold crapping food with tons of salt in Caesar made me almost throw up before I leave the restaurant. No I am stuck with boiling crab. Can't wait to get back there again.",

The wait staff were friendly and quick....no complaints there. The sauce was ordinary....Cajun sauce with garlic...not even a hint of lemon. The crab wasn't worth coming back for and the crawfish, although the sign promised fresh, definitely weren't fresh....nor even edible. We had a side of gumbo which was ok but we both were still hungry because our taste buds were just awakened....not fulfilled.  Since the seafood wasn't worth reordering , we got fried shrimp and fries! That was good...actually very good. But there are lots of places in LVs Chinatown to get tasty fried shrimp.",

    "text": "Very delicious crawfish and sweet potato fries.  Oyster and calamari, and service was lacking  Went here one morning with a group of friends.  It was my first experience.  We were seated immediately and our orders were taken promptly.  However, they only gave us enough salt and pepper thingies and lemons for only half of our group. It took us a good ten minutes to get anyones attention so we could get more.  However, the first person we were able to grab told us we had to wait for our waiter. Okay, the guy couldn't tell the waiter for us? Our guy wasn't paying attention.  The oysters were the first to come out.  Now, I'm not an oyster snob, I don't know the names, I don't know where they come from, I just know if it tastes good or not.  These were not good.  The oyster snobs at my table agreed.  We didn't even eat them all.  We waved down a waiter and asked if we could do anything about it, perhaps deep frying them, since they have fried oysters on the menu.  The guy said no, and walked off. So we were stuck with crappy oysters.  The calamari came out.. Burnt tasting. Not good whatsoever. However, drowning it in ketchup helped. If I could stand the taste, im gonna eat it. I don't like to waste food.  I ordered crawfish in medium and the whole shabang flavor. It was awesome. Large chunks of garlic and a nice spicey flavor.  No complaints here!  Super messy though, I wish I hadn't worn white.  The sweet potato fries were good as well. I loved the slight crunch they had and the sweet flavor.  I'd probably go back if I went to Vegas again, was hungover, and craved crawfish.  Other than that, I'll stick to the one in CA. It was a way better experience.",

    "text": "Yummerz!!! Boiling Crab has been a favorite stop during our trips to L.A., but hated the 2-3 hour waiting time. I'm so glad that BC has finally opened in Vegas!!! Always love the 1lb. shrimps in garlic spread or the whole Sha-bang! (mixture of everything) You can order it with different spice levels, I like mines mild. Sweet potato fries was sooooo good and the garlicky/butter corn on the cob was awesome (if you love garlic like me). We try to stay away from the crawfish and crab stuff since these items are priced by the pound, the shrimp gives more \"meat\" for your money rather than \"shell weight\".  Not too keen on the kids menu, chicken fingers were \"long chicken nuggets\" the kind you can get in the frozen section at the grocery store. As long as kids are happy, I'm happy!  The wait was excellent at around 6:00pm, and the service was great! Food came out quick, servers were on top of refills, and always asked if we were doing okay. It's cheaper than HnJ and Cravin Cajun per pound for the shrimp (8.99 vs. 10.99), so that's a plus, although the shrimps are bigger at Cravin Cajun. The atmosphere is much more pleasant and spacious, parking is no probz as compared to the parking hell at HnJ!...TV's everywhere is appreciated by us sports fanatics this time of the year!!! Overall, great seafood joint, gotta check it out! Happy shelling!!!!",

They always give such little seasoning with a pound of shrimp, it's never enough. Seasoning never settles into the shrimp like it does in So Cal. I'm so use to getting so much flavor within the shrimp & lots of seasoning  Spice level is not always consistent. I'm a fan of spicy food so a few weeks ago when I ordered XXX my mouth was on fire, this week ordered XXX and felt like I was eating medium level.  Their seasoning is not always consistent either. Always get the whole shabang seasoning and it is normally bland or just right.  Cajun fries are to die for!   Also, order rice, don't let that seasoning go to waste after you've finished the shrimp.

Maybe I'm spoiled, but I would rather have my meal come out ready to eat.  I felt like a bomb tech trying to separate the peel and eat shrimp.  And, then having the juices all over your hand afterwards, ugh!  I was afraid I was going to touch my eyes for some reason.  The fried catfish was decent, I liked it, but Michele got sick from it.  So, that's another reason I'm giving it 2 stars.  Changed the whole night for us.  I figured that this was a good experience to have.  Trying something new is always a plus.  Would I go back? Maybe, but I think I would try something else from the menu.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas last weekend and one of our local friends suggested we leave the Strip and head to The Boiling Crab...best decision we made all weekend! This place is so damn delicious AND affordable! Here's how it works:  1. Choose your protein. You can order in 1/2 or 1 pound increments. We ordered 2 pounds snow crab and 1/2 pound shrimp. They were out of sausage so unfortunately we didn't get to try any.   2. Pick your flavor. We chose \"The Whole Sha-bang!\" which is a combination of their other three sauces, Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic.   3. Choose spice level. We went with mild and it was still spicy for me.   4. Choose extras. They serve a bunch of fried food but we didn't order any. We did add potatoes, corn, and a side of garlic sauce to our order though.   5. Eat until you can eat no more. All of the food comes out in giant plastic bags filled with the sauce, garlic cloves, and any extras you added. The seafood is piping hot and fresh! The shrimp are whole and still have the heads on but they are oh so delicious.  6. Pay ridiculously low bill. I don't know how but this place is so affordable! Our bill came out to $41 (for the order listed above). Amazing.   This place blows Joe's Crab Shack out of the water. Lucky for us we live in California and there are THREE Boiling Crab restaurants within 20 minutes of our house. We went again two days after getting back from Vegas.",

Extremely spacious and decorated like the others.  It kind of has a cafeteria feel to it with all the tables settled in the middle and the huge counter to the side.  This location also has its own door/area for to-go.  Nice touch!  I've already written a full review on my take of boiling crab.  Take a quick look at it if you'd like.  Everything's just as good as the Cali locations.  Reason why I'm not giving the place five stars is cause service is still sketch.  This place just opened up a couple weeks ago so I'd imagine it will improve over time but in the mean time they need to step it up.  Although really friendly and inviting, it seems like there are too many people in there just standing around.  The servers I've had were nice enough but I had to keep asking for shit that should be dropped even before my food comes.  ie. salt and pepper, limes, spoons for my rice, bib.  When in Cali, they take your order and come back right away dropping all the stuff needed for BC consumption... No questions asked.  .25 cents for filtered water (whatever), .50 cents for condiments (ranch, tarter sauce, etc.). No liquor license yet, but that's expected cause it takes a while to obtain.  Overall still a great place and I'm happy that they opened one up.  I get my cravings and it's nice that I can finally fulfill.  Cheeeeers!",

    "text": "This was my first time at boiling crab and I had heard plenty of great things about it from my friends in California and my family in Vegas so I was excited.   SERVICE: Our server was Nadia who upon delivering our drinks accidentally spilled them as she took one off. Accidents happen, but she didn't offer to get a new beer which OBVIOUSLY doesn't come with a refill like the other drink did. Now we aren't going to beg for a new drink but the person who had ordered it had asked for another beer which she charged. I mean if you accidentally spill all over your customers table it's nice to offer to get your customers new drinks that are actually full.  Less than halfway through the meal Nadia came back to tell us she was going on her break and that someone else would come to check on us. She asked if we needed anything and at the time we didn't. Maybe ten minutes after a male server came to see if we needed anything, which we did not but that was the LAST time anyone came to check on us.   We were constantly overlooked in the corner booth and had to actually get up and go to the front to get the bill.   FOOD: I wasn't going to let the service put a damper on my experience with the food. We ordered oysters, crab, clams, crawfish and fries. I will not lie. The food was AMAZING!!! A lot better than Hot & Juicy Crawfish.  All in all the food gets this place 2 stars, the service gets 0.",

    "text": "You can't beat cheap spicy seafood in a bag! Always my GO-TO spot whenever I hit up SF and Vegas.  Location- Easy to find same area as food for less (cheap cheap food) and tons of parking out front. Love that this location never has a wait and there's always a table ready for us every time I come here...unlike San Jose's location where you always have an hour or more of a wait time.  Ambiance- It feels like a fisherman's wharf kinda feel to it where the ocean is right out on deck in front. Love the nets, fake crab and ocean decor they have going on all throughout the restaurant. I like that the bathroom never has that nasty feel to it nor does the restaurant have the fishy, ocean smell to it...which says a lot because the place is a seafood restaurant. And I love that the menu is so easy to read and self-explanable for 1st timers.  Food-It's all about the \"XXX WHOLE SHA-BANG\" Basically all the flavors they offer in one from lemon-pepper, Cajun, garlic and butter. You can also choose your spiciness level from xxx, medium, mild and non-spicy...I like the xxx the best because it's super spicy and perfect with all that high calorie goodness sauce...I always ask for extra lime to squeeze inside of my shrimp and corn bag and on top of my rice. The salt and pepper container should also be used for your dipping. I usually always get a pound of shrimp for $8.99/lb. I've also tried their craw fish and crab legs but the shrimp is still my favorite seafood of choice when eating here. Other yummy food items are their raw oysters with the sauce they give..and they are big oysters and it's fresh! The spicy Cajun wings are really juicy, spicy, full of flavor and has tons of meat in them...it's not overly fried nor is it too oily, everyone that has eaten that has loved it. My boyfriend and his friends loved their gumbo for it's flavor and fillingness it gave them.",

I had been hearing about The Boiling Crab from my friends here in L.A. but hadn't had a chance to venture out and try them.  Thankfully the Vegas location was not crowded at all.  I was a little worried about eating here on a Friday night when there was so much going on in town.  We got there at about 7:30pm and were seated right away.  We had:  2 pounds of shrimp with mild Rajun Cajun seasoning Corn for one bag   Gumbo with rice Fried Shrimp Basket  Dos Equis Water Total = $54+ with tax and tip  Highlights: -The prices are extremely reasonable given the amount of food you receive -The amount of food you receive is pretty impressive -Service was fast and friendly (only had to ask for something twice, one time) -Cool and clean decor -My corn was delicious!! Should have ordered more. Hmpf!   Lowlights:  - One has to get over the fact that you can actually see the \"track\" aka poop trail in the back of a lot of your shrimp - Tartar sauce was bland  -The bulk of the flavor for the seafood is at the bottom of the bag, I kept having to dip my shrimp pieces in the sauce  -Did they really just charge me $0.25 for water?!?!?! -Only 2 of the 3 bathrooms were working in the women's restroom (not sure if that is a good sign...)   I know some folks didn't like the mess (or the whole head thing) and I guess that it is part of the experience.  It reminds me of some other crab places (Crab Pot in Long Beach) but with more mess and less flavor.  I'm glad I tried it but there are some other places (Rockin Baja Lobster) that deliver less mess and way more flavor!   Key tips = while you can come here on a date, please be prepared to get a little down and dirty.  Thank goodness for the bibs!",

    "text": "How have I not written a review here before????  I LOVE boiling crab.   The first visit I had dungeness crab, corn, potatoes. It was fantastic.   All other visits I stuck with the shrimp, not because I didn't like the crab, but because the shrimp is a better value and just as tasty. I get either 1 lb or 1.5 lbs add corn and call it good.   Last time, I got the medium spice level and was told \"it's like an 8 out of 10\". Um. No. It was more like a 2 out of 10. I'm not complaining, though, as it was still tasty, I was just looking forward to more spice. They offered to fix it, but I declined. I was in shrimp grubbing mode by that point.   Also, the service could use a little help. There were a couple of times we had to ask someone passing by for something because our actual server was nowhere to be found.   Our last visit there, the table next to us requested to speak with a manager as they were very disappointed and upset with the service, and eventually stormed out. Disappointing, but it happens.   I think if the service was more streamlined, it might help. Right now someone seats you, someone takes your drink order (and sometimes the same person is your \"waiter\"), someone takes your dinner order then another person brings your meal. Honestly, what happened to ONE person taking care of you from start to finish? I think it could improve their service if they had dedicated servers instead of an order taker and a food runner.   Either way, I'll still go back as I love it, it's adequatetly priced and I've had good experiences there.",

I was surprised to be seated right away no wait time! This location is HUGE! Which I loved. A lot of people come here in groups so being able to be seated right away with only a party of 2 was nice.   We ordered a pound each of the shrimp and crawfish then a lobster all with the whole sha-bang sauce medium. Also we ordered corn on the cob and potatoes.   I'm very picky about my seafood so when the order came out I was very happy that it was hot, fresh, and not overcooked. I couldn't believe the size of the lobster it was huge and well worth the price.   This will still continue to be one of my favorite seafood restaurants and I will continue to come back!",

    "text": "On the five-hour drive home, all I could do was talk Mr. W.'s ear off about how young and fresh [just like I like my men?] those crawfish were!  By far my most favorite place for crawfish, hands down.  Mr. W. was the one who had originally wanted to try out The Boiling Crab.  We've all heard how big they are in California and being that Arizona has HnJ and AC, BC was a temptress.  My friend had said it was oily like AC so I was really put off with that notion.  Ignoring her warning, we went to BC and it turned out to be my second favorite meal in Vegas for our trip!  Those crawfish were fresh!  The lungs were still white and not awkwardly grey or muddy; the head-fat wasn't bitter, black, or goopy but perfectly colored and sweet [head-fat that holds together in one sweet piece is an A+ in my book]; and the tail was so easy to break apart.  Chipping your nails trying to wrestle a tiny piece of tail-meat always leaves me salty so this makes me very happy.  The whole sha-bang sauce is pretty decent with chunks of garlic, not too spicy [this is where HnJ might have a *slight* advantage... their sauce is more broth-like] and not as oily as my friend made it out to be.  I enjoyed my every bit of my 2lbs. of crawfish and I will admit that I probably could have taken down another pound!  We also shared 1lb of lemon pepper shrimp, six raw oysters [plump, briny, and delicious] with lip-smacking spicy cocktail sauce [I liked to dip my crawfish meat in it every now and then], and a cup of gumbo [I recommend getting it with more sausage and shrimp].  Mr. W. had his heart set on the chowder but they sadly ran out.  Oh well.  Only means we have to stop by again!  I washed all this down with a sweet green tea and it was a great dinner in Sin City!  This restaurant is huge so a wait time was never an issue for us even at 6:00PM.  I love how sweet and attentive the wait staff is!  Pitchers of limes dumped onto the table?  Yes please!  I also like how they tie the bibs on you.  Ain't nobody got time for that in Arizona!  ;)  I'll be daydream of slurping the juice out of the head before ripping it apart for some head-fat!",

You basically order your seafood of choice, pick a sauce, then pick a heat level.  I like how they have their own cups and bags for to go food. It's a nice touch.  We had a server, Shelly, who was delightful. She pretty much waited on our party of about 7 alone. She checked on us frequently, refilled our drinks often, and we never had to look for her.  The food was good. I got a lb of shrimp in the whole she-bang. This is their three sauces mixed together. It was good over all but I thought it lacked in citrus flavor. I'll definitely get lemon pepper next time as a squirt of lime really made the sauce taster for my pallet.   I also had some calamari, sweet potato fries, lemon pepper fries, and Cajun fries. It was a cool option to choose spice level on the Cajun fries. I also took some gumbo the go which was delicious.  Overall I enjoyed my first time at boiling crab. Would I return? Yes. The staff I encountered all seemed happy,  our server did a great job, and my food was comparable to hot n juicy.",

Their menu is easy to go through and our waitress (I forgot her name:( but she was really really great ) was super helpful! She helped guide us noobies through what to pick and always checked up on us for refills!   Overall a place that can't get any better!

What ever the spicy sauce is that that serve with the oysters the one in the plastic container with a lid that stuff is really good. I have also had the shrimp and craw fish, and tried the diff seafood with Mild whole she-bang sauce and no spicy, just with the sauce. I prefer the no spicy cause the sauce they serve with it is all ready slightly spicy and I think adding more spiciness to the seafood takes away from the flavor of the seafood. Kinda like when you eat a raw jalapeno you can only taste the hotness you couldn't taste the flavor of the other food. The meat in the bags go really well with rice cause you have all the extra sauce.",

Their menus & concepts are practically identical yet the 2 are quite different~   Atmosphere: I prefer BC! The restaurant is huge with plenty of TVs and I love how you can tag up their walls ~  Service: BC wins! Their servers are always smiley & happy! I love how they put your bibs on for you~  Quality: I think it's a tie! Both places have always had fresh seafood! Yummmmmy! And they usually have the same prices~   Corn/Potatoes/Sausage: For some reason they taste better at BC.. they just do!   Special Sauce: I prefer the Hot & Juicy special sauce over the whole shabang! It has a stronger deeper flavor and you can definitely taste the garlic! BC can sometimes be way too salty for me..  Overall, The Boiling Crab wins but not by that much! I still like to eat at both places ~",

I got my usual whole shabang medium shrimp and really disappointed in the quality. The skin on the shrimp was sticking to the shrimp and the sauce??? The sauce was missing in action!!! I usually have enough to pour on my rice but I couldn't get anything flowing out of the bag. So I asked the waitress, \"hey, is there anyway I can get a side of sauce?\" She was like \"yeah okay but it's extra\" and I told her I have been coming to this one since it opened and it's the first time I can't get anything out of the bag and even the ones in LA aren't so lacking in sauces and she said that they follow the guidelines and basically it is what it is. I thought that was rude but you know I'm just never going to come to this one again and stay True to the ones in LA! Problem solved. So finally after I had peeled my whole pound of shrimp my sauce finally came, I was starving and couldn't really wait but I didn't really enjoy it as much as I usually do.   PS. It is my birthday today.",

Extra sauce costs $2.50. Usually at other locations in California we would take home the leftover sauce and use it to cook our own seafood. Not the case this time. Also, we ordered the whole shabang, but it definitely had more of the lemon taste and garlic than it should. Because of all this, I had to take off one star.   However, this one is the largest location we've been to, so even though they were busy as usual, the wait wasn't long to be seated and our food came out fast. They should probably slow down a bit and add more sauce to the bags...  But I'd still come back to give them another try.",

BC offers also snacks such as catfish with fries, chicken strips, chicken wings and lemon pepper, regular or cajun fries too. per tray is about $6 to $8 and they were yummy, bun and I might get this every time because you can mix and match what fries you'd like so you can get the best of best worlds ^^  The bill was interesting -- because the total for BC was about the same as HnJ, BC was about $45-$50 with tip because my server was awesome and HnJ was about $40 with tip. For BC we had more food and that's including getting soda too.   The cajun fries here at more of a spicy kick and HnJ are more cajun tasting. Lbs of shrimp between here and HnJ is about the same $11-$13 I believe  Both are good in my book, will probably be just whatever I feel like eating that night haha",

Try looking at your food for 7 minutes watching it get cold, seems like hours. Dinner at the same table should be delivered at the same time not in shifts.  Two of us ordered the crab. I have eaten crab for years maybe 500 to 600 crabs in my life time in several states and country. Never in my 70 years has the crab not been cleaned. I open the crab only to find guts and green slim spilling all over my food. I nearly threw -up. The smell was overwhelming. The server was no where in site the entire dinning time and when I complain to the manager she couldn't of care less. Her commit was that the way we do things. Green slim and gut covering your food. I think not. Wish Joe's was still open. Stay far, far away.",

We took a cab from the main strip - it's not that close and the cab ride was about $30 with tip included.   We arrived around 2:00pm and there was still a wait - I would recommend getting a reservation before you come. This place seems busy no matter what time you are there. After we were leaving, the dinner rush came and the wait was even longer.  The food: we ordered crawfish in the she-bang sauce and the Cajun ragin sauce. We also ordered 2 dozens of their oysters and the snow crab legs and king crab legs in both Cajun ragin and She-bang sauce. All of it was really good, I do prefer that She-bang sauce tho because it has a slight kick to it! And OMG the oysters were so gooooooodddd. These were Gold Bonds which are gulf oysters and they were amazing. We stopped eating the crab legs and just ordered more oysters! Lol!  I'm glad we tried this place, service was great and I'd definitely come back. If I were to compare this and Hot N Juicy, I would say hot n juicy is better but this spot is pretty damn good too. I'm salivating now! Lol",

    "text": "When I'm in the mood for crawfish, my first thought is never Boiling Crab in Garden Grove because I hate the wait and the loudness and the charge for what seems like every little thing. The food itself isn't too bad, but I find it more worth my time and money to go to the Cajun Corner, a bit further down Brookhurst. With that being said, I was still interested in trying the Boiling Crab that opened in Las Vegas. Little naive me was hoping it wouldn't be too bad.  K. and I went on a Wednesday night, and unlike the GG BC, there was no line outside the door. Yay! However there was a short wait, about 10 minutes. However when we were seated, I was able to see that although the restaurant may have had all the tables booked, the booths along the side were deserted. That irked me a little, and also because our hostess was slightly rude. When she sat us down, she didn't even bother to look at us when she was talking to us. She told us the usual, here's your table and your server will be with you shortly, blah blah, but she must've been talking to another table seated behind us, because she sure as heck wasn't looking at us. Or maybe she was, I just couldn't tell underneath the inch-wide layer of eyeliner. Little makeup tip for you sweetie, that look is so 5 years ago. Makeup is supposed to accentuate your features, not hide them. You're wearing it wrong. Moving on...  Our server took a bit long to reach us. I noticed that a family got seated after us, yet they were waited upon before us. That's never cool. But whatever..so I have been to BC before so I know they charge for water, which I personally think is ridiculous, but whatever, so K. and I brought our own water. Turns out they have a policy where you can't bring your own water (!!!!!!!) but our waitress was nice enough to give us a cup to pour our water into. The food seemed like it took a loooot longer to come out, and there's no way this place is as busy as the one in GG.  K. and I both ordered crawfish, mild, the whole she-bang, and the food itself wasn't too bad. I did miss having condiments though...I'm so used to getting free condiments at the Cajun Corner, but eh. One huge plus was the corn was soo freakin' good. Quite possibly the best tasting corn I've ever had at a crawfish place.   My experience here wasn't too bad, but it wasn't great. When in socal, I'll just stick to the Cajun Corner, and when in Vegas, I'll just curb my craving 'til I get back home. Probably won't come back.  Oh, one more thing, awesome music though! Dashboard Confessional, Yellowcard, Something Corporate...if that was someone's ipod, awesome taste in music! =)",

This place is always a blast and the food is always on point. The price is fairly decent for what you get and the service has always been outstanding for us when we go but maybe thats just because they see us in here every week to every other week. You order by the half pound or the pound depending how much you can eat. I usually go with the sausage and the shrimp and throw in 2 corns with the \"whole shibang\" and it always hits the spot. The Cajun fries is something i tend to also order as another fav to add to my meal. Parking is easy as there is alot of it. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Def a spot i think people need to check out.",

All my friends and family love this place! I get the pound of shrimp, cajun style in mild usually and it is delicious. I love the whole shabang. Also, you can add corn to your order and it is wonderfully seasoned! I've had the fresh oysters (ANOTHER AMAZING FOOD) and cajun fries in mild and they are great. The snow crab by the pound is probably the most delicious thing they have there! It is so sweet and tender... Also if you're a lover of wings... Try their chicken wings they are wonderfully tender and perfectly fat with meat. And lastly, try the fried shrimp it is great! the price is great, the food is great, and the atmosphere is awesome. it's a must visit!",

I went there last week with my hubby. The food over all is awesome, pretty much same taste like LA the only diffrent is the sauce, LA put a little bit more on it. This place is hugee.... which is better cos back in LA, i always hav to wait inline for 30-60 minutes cos they place way to small. Talk about the service, first of all, they have too many server and they do nothing. second, they r ANOYING!! why? lemme tell the story. we still ate at that time n our server give us a check. its ok, we dont mind. I am a slower eater, so my hubby finish first and he waited for me. meanwhile, he looked aroud then he told me that the server keep watching us, we asume that they want us to pay the bill first, but pleaseee.... it was just 9 PM, n they closed at 10 and i am still eating. we ignore it. but then they keep coming to our table and asked is everything ok. more than 2 server came and asked like that, and in like maybe 30  minutes, there was more than 3 times they came. and I was still eating. OMG!!!! finally we pay first and i still continue my dinner. after we pay, they never come back, but actually we need another pen to sign cos the pen thet they gave wasnt working. They just talk eachoter, start ignoring us cos we pay already. Vegas server suck. LA much much better. so, my 4 star is for the food taste n quality, but for the service, only 1.  water for 25 cent? oh pleaseee.... thats ridiculous. so, if i get choke i have to pay 25 cent to get a water??!!!!",

If I had reviewed them on my visit before this last one, I would have given them 5 stars, however they fell quite short on this last visit and unfortunately I've only become obsessed with Yelping recently.  The service was great.  We got seated right away despite it being pretty busy.  The server was attentive and nice, although they didn't bib us, to my great disappointment.  In fact, they brought out all our food before giving us bibs so then they had to bring them out and we put them on hurriedly while holding back from salivating all over the table.   My number one complaint is the food.  I ordered shrimp and king crab legs with the Whole Shabang sauce.  It had been a while since I had eaten there but I remember the taste of the Whole Shabang sauce like it was yesterday.  The sauce from the other night was NOT the same.  It was tasteless, like the chef forgot to put salt in.  I had coat my seafood with lime juice and use the salt and pepper shaker.  The shrimp were a little overcooked and tough.    On the bright side, the meat from the crab legs were tender and yummy but it just wasn't enjoyable because the sauce lacked flavor.  I was severely disappointed because since my friend and I had nailed down our plans the night before, I had been dreaming of that delicious stinky salty spicy flavor and it just wasn't what I had built up in my mind.    I will have to try Hot N Juicy again and do a comparison.  Maybe it was just an off night.  I'm more than willing to go back and try again!",

    "text": "**Confession: Hot & Juicy Crawfish literally blows Boiling Crab outta the water!!! No I don't work there or own any stock in the company.***  After all of the rave reviews that I've read & heard about from friends, I decided to give the Boiling Crab a try. My first visit to Hot & Juicy was literally 2 weeks ago, so despite my typical high alcohol intake, the experience was still fresh in my mind.  Like Hot & Juicy, a friend & I also visited Boiling Crab on a Friday night. The place is pretty big, with TVs all around. STRIKE 1: It wasn't crowded (or @ full capacity) and the wait was minimal (7-10 mins). That shoulda been a sign to get in our cars & drive up the street to Hot & Juicy, but it wouldn't have been fair to leave without even walking inside, right?   STRIKE 2: The server was ok, but he definitely wasn't as fun or friendly as any other servers I had recently encountered. I ordered shrimp & crabs @ XXX spice level, with the whole shabang (Cajun, lemon pepper, & garlic sauce). My friend ordered fried calamari & crawfish @ medium spice level w/the whole shabang.   Anyone who knows me (or has read any of my reviews) knows that alcohol is always an important part of my meals. As usual, I had already indulged in some vino before we arrived and was hoping to keep the party going by keeping the liquor flowing. STRIKE 3: This place only sells beer. No wine! I asked if we could bring in a bottle & have them uncork it for us, but that wasn't an option either.  I'm not a big beer drinker so I think I opted for raspberry ice tea instead. I was obviously already tipsy cuz I hate iced tea! What the heck was I thinking? The goal is to continue the buzz, not kill it! Why was I even still there after 3 strikes? 3 strikes & you're out, right? Blame it on the al-al-al-al-co-alcohol!   Anyway, food finally comes out & in my opinion, it was just ok. The shrimp didn't seem as fresh (one should not have to fight w/the fishies @ the table) as those @ Hot & Juicy and the seasoning is nowhere near as savory! My friend said the calamari was dry & the crawfish was also just ok. Don't remember what kind of crab we got, so it was obviously forgettable.  Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed and haven't decided if I would even visit any of the other locations to make a comparison. Granted, I had an amazing time @ Hot & Juicy during my initial visit, so it would be difficult for any other place to add up in comparison.  My advice is to run like the wind to Hot & Juicy Crawfish where you can get fantastic food, fabulous service, & vino to go with your meal!",

(even tho we ended up backninside right as name was called) April was our server & super friendly& helpful. They were out of crawfish& dungeoness crab. We ordered a lb each of shrimp & king crab legs-mild-whole shabang. even tho they told us kitchen was a lil backed up-i didnt feel we waited any longer than any other restaurant. the food: MAN o MAN!! delicious flavors- we both felt the mild was perfect heat level for us. It still had a little kick, but wasn't overly spicy. It was delicious for sure!! w 2drinks, corn, potatoes & 2lbs of king crab and shrimp-bill was 100$. and for the freshness, deliciousness..& amount of food we got-DEF worth every penny.  as noted-out servers (april..who's shift ended before we left..& another server-guy (i think his name was alex?) were both excellent..drinks never stayed empty-&any questions were answered w ease.  forget those lame buffets..get some good fresh seafood here!!!  *just save me some crawfish next time!!",

Been there twice in the past 13 months and I have enjoyed eating there both times. Seafood is good, spices were good and the staff there are very nice.   A few tips? 1. Do not go there on a first date; you don't want your fingers smelling fishy, do you? 2. Do not wear really nice clothes, for you have a chance of ruining them. 3. Do not keep stuff on the table; table gets messy when eating. 4. ENJOY IT!",

I liked that they tied the bibs on you, it is the little things that make a difference. Kept our glasses full, and checked in on us regularly.  We got a pound of shrimp, two orders of corn and potatoes in the Whole She Bang sauce, mild spicy, which was the way to go. As well as a bowl of gumbo with rice.  The gumbo was SO good.  Packed full with okra, shrimp and sausage.   I have been to that other place people compare this one too. And I will say, I liked this one more. I wasn't over loaded with TVs showing sports.  And it was as if they were playing my iPod, which I loved.   I was disappointed that they don't open until 3. We pulled up at 2, found out they weren't open but were starving, so drove through and grabbed a taco at el pollo loco next door, then wasted some time at a store then returned.  I am very excited that there are several of these around where I live in CA, and will be going to one of them out here to get my fill before my next trip to Vegas.",

The menus look very different than other locations but variety is the same.  Whole shebang at XXX spicy. Shrimp was good. Corn was good. Sweet potato fries were good. The dungeness crab we got was gigantic and slightly overcooked (but not as bad as other another time in another location).  Large lot, plenty of tables and space.

With that being said, they food is really good and comes out fast and fresh in their own individual bags or baskets. Their policy also is that you cannot mix sauces or order something and get half in 1 sauce and half in another. I tried and they said that this wasn't possible...not sure why. While there were no complaints about the food, I do have to say that some of the employees here are a little rude. I got some attitude from the hostess when trying to see how close my name was from being called on the list...she even yanked the book violently away from me and slammed it in my face. This was completely uncalled for and has never happened at any other restaurants. Because of this I am deducting stars from my review and am unsure if I'll return.",

    "text": "Be prepared to bring a jacket/sweater.. It is FREEZING inside! Great big space for big parties! Friendly and attentive staff!   I've recently decided that I like Boiling Crab over Hot N Juicy.. Although I HATE the lingering garlic, spices and butter smell in your hands and mouth equally!  This place is actually not that garlicky and the smell only last for three days tops! LOL  I always eat shrimp or crab here but this night I actually tried the crawfish-- weird little creatures-- all it's goodness is in the head, then the body has the smallest amount of meat! It was good first try but I prefer my shellfishes to be shrimp or crab!  Concept : Pick how many pounds of shrimp, crawfish, crab or lobster you want to eat. Pick a spice (Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter and the (recommended) Whole Sha-Bang). You also get a choice of if you want to add sausages (delicious!), corn (goes great with everything) or potatoes! They cook everything up in the spices and serve it in a bag, steamed and ready to serve to a table with nothing but napkins and your drinks!  They also have good sides like rice, fries, and sweet potatoes.   Other items for the none Cajun peeps would be wings, chicken fingers, oysters, fried oysters, or fried shrimp!  This is not my choice of food personally, but Boiling Crab does the job when the better half is craving it!",

All in all, I give 3 stars bc the spice just wasn't right. Somehow the taste was bland like it was missing something. But I do admit that I got plenty of shrimp. And plenty of fries as well.

Also be careful with your credit card. The card we used had fraudulent activity after going there the first time and when we went back they explained to us that the reason they check IDs now is because someone was stealing credit card numbers.   With that aside I love the food, I love the flavor. I usually get chicken tenders with medium barbecue sauce which is always delicious and fresh, a dozen oysters, 2 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of shrimp in the whole Shebang sauce, Mild flavor which to me is still very very spicy sometimes. I also order corn in butter, delicious.   The atmosphere is alright. Very busy every time I go and usually at least a 30-60 min wait no matter what, but I always go on a Friday night so it's expected. Prepare to eat out of bags on a table of paper. :-) The flavor is addicting to me so I will be a frequent customer no matter how bad the service is as long as it stays delectable!",

Write it on the gigantic menu, have the server tell the customer what's not in stock, something! That's really frustrating.

Especially because I get uber anxious driving to the one in Koreatown. Not to mention the wait time in ktown =/  My hubs and I came around 4 pm and the restaurant was maybe 1/4 filled. The first thing that shocked me was the size of this location. It's so open and pretty big compared to ktown. Our waiter was really friendly and spoke a bit too soft. But it could've been the noise inside that made it difficult to hear.   As we were seated, we are informed that they were out of blue crabs and dungeness crabs, which was a huge let down, but in hind sight probably better.   The reviewer that mentioned the flavor not being on par as the other location, totally hit it on the head. We ordered a pound of shrimp with the whole shebang-medium and was sorely disappointed at the sauce in the bag. The sauce was barely liquid and primarily had chunks of the seasoning, making the sauce uber salty. We also ordered the king crab legs (a pound, which came out to three large legs) and same issue with the sauce.   The shrimp and crab legs were definitely over cooked. But that didn't stop me from eating them.. Especially when our bill came out to over $65.  We also ordered catfish with cajun fries - which my hubs loved. The only downside was the fries got cold pretty quick.. And I love my fries to be crispy and crunchy.   Overall, it was an okay experience and I've definitely had better. I wish I would've checked out the new place that just opened up. Probably won't come back the next time we're in Vegas.",

I was happy with the food, and our sever was extremely courteous.  Pros: Food quality was good. Service was sufficient. Food portion was plentiful. Establishment was clean. Clean restrooms. Fast seating. Parking wasn't a hassle. Menu is easy to read.  Cons: Bill had items I didn't order. Interior decoration was minimal. Nothing amazing.  Overall: I enjoyed my experience here. Mistakes happen, and the service plus food preparation was acceptable. Pricing is about the same as Hot N Juicy, although pricing varies by pound per market value. I have more Pros than Cons, so I'm a happy camper. Great job!",

    "text": "Team Hot & Juicy! Sorry, for fresh seafood, I prefer that place. Boiling Crab has good crab, but I was surprisingly more impressed with their fried dishes. This place always has a wait, even if it goes pretty quick, so plan ahead or go elsewhere if you're in a rush- this isn't fast food.  SHRIMP: Do it right, whole she-bang, with your preferred spice level. Shrimp is my go-to seafood boiling critter, but I've been underwhelmed by overcooked shrimp that is hot but not juicy.. as elsewhere. SNOW CRAB LEGS: Priced by the pound, sold by the unit, accompanied by tools. Lemon pepper garlic is your best choice, spice it up if you want. We got someone else's order by accident, which was Ragin' Cajun cranked up to hot, and it was surprisingly good. I don't really get why the legs are cooked with seasoning in the bag, as the sauce doesn't penetrate to the meat. Shrug. FRIED OYSTERS: They were out of the raw option on my visit, so we stuck to fried before I read a tip warning us against them on the app. Good thing I ignored it though, because they were tasty. Maybe they're not consistent? FRIED CATFISH BASKET: Basket comes with cajun fries, which are thin, hot, and perfectly crisp. The fish comes in 4-5 huge pieces of hot, juicy, flaky fish, served with one single cup of a lightly-flavored tartar sauce. I'd get this again. It's a huge portion for only $10, too.  I'm not a huge fan of the oddly corporate-chain feel of the space but I can't put my finger on what gives me the weird vibe. The food is fresh and it's a fun dining environment, but I have no idea why this place is so popular with H&J in town as a worthy competitor.  TIP: This might be a good spot to watch a game, as there are ~50 TV screens hanging everywhere. But they seem to be showing SD instead of HD, so picture quality isn't great and they don't seem to have any game-day specials. But it's an option to keep in mind if you want to watch your team AND spend time with your family. Plus they have beer.",

Everything was great up until I told the waitress that I did not get my fried shrimp; and butter that i ordered for my crab legs. We were, once again,  heads down enjoying our meal when she came back, without butter, and told us that the person who delivers food said he had delivered our shrimp.  We told her that we never got the shrimp, she then came back, without butter,  and told us that they had to check the cameras! We're in your restaurant,  spending our money and you're telling us that we can't get what we ordered and instead, accusing us of stealing fried shrimp. Mind you,  we're eating crab legs,  whole crabs,  raw and fried oysters,  yet you have to check footage to validate that we didn't get fried shrimp? The back and forth of this issue took well over 20 minutes,  long enough for our food (that needed butter) and the experience to be cold and horrific at the same time. We never got that shrimp...we never got that butter.",

On arrival: 30 minute wait. I figure place was packed it's still really good so I'll eat here.  We ordered a LB of the shrimp - and a LB of king Crab.  One pound- about 4 legs. Figure ok it's fine my date was pretty and the rice was good. Then something evil happened the next day.   Mud Butt. I felt weak all throughout the day after-  but looking back I should have seen the tell tale sighs of a soggy shell and I could be mistaken but the shrimp seemed limp and didn't pop out of the shell as usual.   Day two- I have to be within 5 steps of the toilet. I have apologized to everyone I have ever wronged while my intestines came out as water through my ass.   And my date? She's still insanely  cute- but throwing up and now has the same case of booty juice.   Won't be back for awhile. I may not eat a crustacean in fact after the malaise of mayhem pinching my guts.

When they brought me the lobster it was obviosly much bigger than that.  The waitress said don't touch it I'll go find out the actual wht.  What the heck. Im just supposed to sit here and stare at my lobster? She finally comes back the lobster is 2.72 lbs so ovet $60!  No offer to give it to for the price I asked for.   In stead , \"do you want me to bring a smaller one\".   By that point I'm starving so I said no.  Plus asked numerous times for butter  finally came after most the crab was eaten.  Lobster was tuff too.  Not worth 60.",

The whole she bang tasted like paprika with butter.  Its just messy.  No utensils, the bag the food comes in is your plate, you use your hands, food is hot..not too pleasant.  There were napkins at the table but no towels to clean up your hands after dinner.  The bag leaked so the butter dripped off the table onto the chair and my pants. I went to the restroom to wash the greasy feeling off of my hands.  For the price we paid we should have gone to a nice seafood buffet and paid less with other choices included in the price.  I'm not sure we will be back.",

    "text": "This is my favorite seafood spot in Vegas hands down! The service is usually great and they have a small but good menu. The prices do change depending on market price so you never know if the prices can change on the seafood. And if one pound of shrimp is too much for you, you can definitely get a half pound which is great because one pound is a little too much for me. My go to flavors are the whole Shabang which is a mixture of all there seasonings and a medium spice . This place is so popular that the wait time can be pretty long sometimes especially on the weekends but I do believe they get there seafood fresh on Fridays( not sure, don't quote me on that), Also there Cajun fries (medium spice)are a must there so delicious especially with there ketchup. Overall if you like spicy food and seafood this is a place you need to check out!",

The workers started cleaning up the restaurant forgetting about customers that were still sitting having dinner. We felt rushed. We got our food and we're never checked if we needed anything else.

I haven't been here for a couple years, and I don't recall the food being so overpriced for small sized crabs, shrimp, oysters, etc. It would be nice if they offered combinations like shrimp with sausages, corn, etc. rather than paying $1.50 or so for 1 corn that has been overcooked. We waited about 15-20 minutes to be seated. My party was called , and as we walked to our table, we ended up actually not having a table because it was all of a sudden taken by another party. So, we had to go back and sit down.  Our server did his best to be nice. He was just forgetful when we would ask for things.  The gumbo with rice is pretty good. So was the calamari and chicken tenders. On the other hand. the fried chicken and the French fries were super over seasoned and just awful.  Otherwise, the crab and shrimp was good.   I don't think I would come to this particular boiling crab.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to the venue. The food was pretty good, but there were a few issues that we ran into. We order the king crab legs, shrimp, clams, corn and potatoes in \" no spicy garlic\" flavoring, which was perfect for me since I don't eat spicy foods. The waitress was gracious enough to explain to me that no spicy would be a spicy level of one to two, and be mild spicy would be a level of 4 to 5. My initial inclination was to order 4 to 5 but that would have been way too spicy for me so I'm glad she made the recommendation. (No spicy level of 1 to 2 was perfect for me!)   The food was delicious! My only complaint was that some of the shrimp was really mushy and just wasn't fresh. Other than that, the rest of the food was really good. A lot of the items on the menu are marked \"MP\" for market price so you really don't know what you're paying for it until the check is issued. We ended up spending $80 on our meal which was pretty average for what I usually pay for seafood boil.   I definitely would have given this restaurant a 4-star rating if the shrimp would have been more fresh.  Otherwise, I think it really deserves a 3.5 start rating,  that but that wasn't an option. My only other issue, was it was rather difficult to get ahold of our server because the restaurant was so busy and it was so hectic. It reminded me of a cafeteria setting. Also, coming from Atlanta, we usually get our order in one bag so we can easily get a variety of all the seafood ordered, but they didn't have it that way here. Everything came an individual bags and you just kind of had to pick through the bags. When I asked if there was a way I can mix it I was told to just dump it on the table or put all the bags together into one bag. I really didn't want my food sitting on table liner paper so I just left it in the ba. Regardless, it's still definitely worth checking out.",

The next waitress seemed annoyed with our questions. I told her this was our first time eating here and she softened up a little. She took our order and disappeared. Before we know it our food came, then our new waitress introduced herself. She seemed bothered and barely looked at us which annoyed me a little but my mom was fine so I brushed it off.

My recommendations are to order everything as the \"whole shebang!\" with my favorites being the Shrimp and the Snow crab.  I really enjoy the flavor and meat in both and usually get my meal with a corn cob which soaks up the sauce in the bag.   My least favorite thing about this restaurant is the waste. I can't help but feel a little sad watching all the trash, paper and plastic pile up after each table cranks out it's customers. I hope the restaurant owner considers making this spot a little more environmentally friendly.",

When I come I always order 1 pound of fresh crawfish the whole shabang medium, 1 pound of shrimp the whole shabang medium, raw oysters, Cajun fries medium, and rice. The spice is perfect for me but I LOVE spicy so medium may be spicier to some if you aren't a big spicy eater.  This is my go-to place to take people who haven't been here or the ones visiting from out of town. My first timers always get the crab which is good as well but I feel like it's more work to get open-- well for me it is lol.   I will continue to keep eating here all the time. I'm seriously here ALL the time lol",

The menu prices are not outrageous like you would expect for a seafood restaurant. $15 for a dozen raw oysters. Not bad.  The spices on the Gulf shrimp and the clams were very good. It was not that hot for me though. I prefer spicy foods, so it may be hot for some people. The fried oysters were also very good. The raw oysters they serve are from the Gulf of Mexico. I prefer cold water oysters, but these were excellent. The fried shrimp were good, but small. The king crab and the fried calamari were good too.  The only complaints I have is that they do not have metal forks to shell the shrimp, so it is a tedious task with the sauce all over the shrimp. It makes it difficult to shell with your fingers or the plastic fork they give you. Next visit I will have to bring my own fork. They also have Green Mussels that are not on the menu. They were good, but they were not cooked long enough and the mussels did not open.  I will definitely be back. I look forward to trying the other items on the menu. I would recommend this place if you enjoy seafood.",

Maybe a good sign. Wrong. Very, very, very rough crowd. What restaurant needs security at the door? Unsure if food place or urban night club.    Came by myself. Host rudely said we don't seat parties of one. ??? My money isn't good enough since I'm not dressed like Nicki Minaj (which implies, this place isn't family friendly by any means). They tell me I can order Togo. -shrug- I'm sure crab travels well. The guy at the Togo register was so confused. I ordered a lb of King Crab. 19.99/lb. \"I can't charge you, we don't know how much they're going to cook you.\" .... I ordered a lb. How is that a question? I understand it's over/under to an extent. I order a beer. He said the food would be 15 minutes. Gets another girl to get my beer (all bottles, no bar seating). She then says my food will be 25-35 minutes. What?!  \"He took too long to put it in.\"  JFC. That's a terrible excuse. I cancel the order. There's no seating and I'm not standing 40 minutes to wait for a questionable amount of food.   So a $6 Newcastle later, that you have to drink in concert like setting, with all sorts of half-dressed people against you, I've determined this may be the worst place in Vegas, and I didn't even get the chance to judge the food.",

I have to say that it was really good and really messy, the way I like it. Shrimp were nice and big and while fresh crawfish are out of season, their frozen crawfish worked just fine for me. I also ordered a side of fries with their hottest seasoning, for me it was perfectly spicy, just enough to make you sweat but still delicious.

I love the seafood at both places and I think the sauces both have to offer have a unique appeal that can't quite be compared. As for the food, they are on the same level to me.   At The Boiling Crab, you can graffiti all over their walls! A cute little novelty going on, but it shows the character of the place well. Going there just makes you excited, and gives you one more thing to occupy your boredom as you wait super long in line. This puts it into comparison with Hot N Juicy where I just dread the long lines before I get to the freedom of the seafood.   The servers are also super friendly. The service here goes a long way. They smile at you, and it's a really big one at that. I really appreciate these kinds of things.  I think we do have to commend their side dishes though. I decided to order the fried calamari to calm my hunger as the food took longer for us, and it didn't feel like I was being drenched in oil. The batter was lightly coated and I could actually taste the calamari so kudos to them.",

    "text": "If you asked me before tonight how many stars I would give this place, I would probably have said 4-5 stars.   Tonight was a kind of busy night, but not extremely busy, like we have seen plenty of times. The service was very disappointing tonight. When our waitress finally came over, we were set on what to order (from food to drinks). The waitress was only ready to take our drink order and those took awhile to finally come to us. Ordering our food took entirely too long, because the prices on the board were wrong and they don't have Blue Crab (Do they ever?!). After finally ordering, she told us it would take 20-25 minutes for our food because of the crab (Apparently they only have 1 cooking station for crab at the place called boiling CRAB!). So, I told her I wanted to change my order to the shrimp, since we were starving & didn't want to wait that long. So, she repeated our order to us and right before walking away, she said \"It will still take 20-25 minutes to come out, bc of the shrimp.\" Really?! You couldn't tell me that after I said I didn't want to wait 20-25 mins for crab? Why would I wanna wait that long for the shrimp?   Ugh. We will be not be coming back, unless family wants to go or we REALLY REALLY want some Boiling Crab.",

Such a change from the Cali locations and long waits. Our order was taken quickly and the staff was friendly. Whole shebang yet again. Quality seems pretty in line with Cali. It was great!! Nice to have one in Vegas as I do prefer tier sauce over hot n juicy. First timers just a heads up, their sauce (whole shebang)  is much more spicier than hot n juicy. Even if you order mild. There is still quite a kick so if I were you I would order the single flavorings instead. But I love me some spice!",

Our shrimp was served minutes before the fries which was just poor management of allowing partial orders to be delivered to tables, maybe this is why the fries were past their prime.

I initially wanted mussels but they were sold out so I was a bit bummed. But let me tell you their clams are AMAZING! Truly excellent. Everything was cooked perfectly and well seasoned and delicious! My mom hadn't been to the boiling crab in several years and she was very impressed and throughly enjoyed herself. When we arrived we were seated within 15 minutes and our server ANTHONY was so nice and polite he added to the overall amazing dining experience. I just felt bad because I couldn't tip him the 20 dollars I wanted to (our bill was about 90) because they wouldn't accept it on the bank card since we didn't pay any of our bill on that bank card (we paid with a gift card). But next time I go back I will ask for Anthony specifically because he was so amazing. I def recommend this boiling crab and especially the clams, they're my new favorite! And be sure to ask for Anthony he's great!",

It offers the same quality and flavors as the ones in SoCal minus the long waits......and I believe the reason for that is because this has to be the largest BC I have been to, I have heard the stories of Rowland Heights having a large location, but the one in LV is quite large with a bazillion LCD TVs plastered everywhere so you don't miss anything going on in the sports world.  Service was good, but the food came out rather slow, hmmmm, but when it did, it was fantastic. I love the whole sha bang which in my opinion is the staple of this establishment that other restaurants try to copy but seem to fail because they all can't seem to figure out the measurements and probably some other stuff lol. My shrimp was cooked pretty well, except for probably the last 2 or so but by then I was stuffed. Also I tried the Whole Shabang sauce on some white rice, pretty damn good, I recommend you try that.",

We tried The Whole Shebang sauce and it had an overly excessive amount of garlic. HUGE chunks of garlic, which was really unappetizing. Also, we felt the lobster was a bit over cooked.  The restaurant is large with A LOT of flat screen TVs, so it's good if you want to come for the big game.  Also, the service was HORRIBLE. Not just from one person, but from everybody!! We got the saucy spicy, so any logical waiter would know that we would probably need a lot of water during our meal. There was probably a period during our meal when a waiter didn't come by for 15 minutes! We literally had to stop eating because we were so thirsty and didn't have anything to drink. You will probably see me at Hot N Juicy from now on.",

My problem with this visit was our server. The Boiling Crab work ethic from California has not trickled over to this location. The staff in Alhambra is always very attentive and your cup never stays empty for longer than 30 seconds. I had at least 8 people go by without asking. Plus each server seems to only care for their area instead everyone is for everyone. Also, our server did not ask if we wanted anything else. She just brought us the bill before we were even finished eating. I don't like the feeling of getting rushed through my meal.   Like other BCs this location could have a line out the door with a 2 hour wait if they gave their customers a little more attention.   Time for service training from corporate.",

Sometimes Hot N Juicy gets crowded ( not like Boiling crab doesn't or anything) , or sometimes you might want an alternative to the asian/creole style shrimp/crawfish, and the boiling crab is the perfect alternative to hot n juicy. Id recommend this place to anybody. The only bad thing i have to say about this place, other than the obvious messy eat, and hand smell hours/days after consumption, is that this place gets very large groups....and it always seems like these large groups are always late to show up, and sit there doing nothing after they eat, taking up valuable seats to hungry waiting customers.

We asked our server the market price of a few items and she did not know them and had to run to the back and ask. She also forgot to give us our bibs after we ordered. So we are off to a rocky start but I dismiss it. Then my food arrived under seasoned and cold. I had to send it back to get it fixed and the manager took care of it. Other than that, the food tasted fine after it was fixed. Throughout the course of my meal I was constantly being interrupted by different servers asking how my meal was and if I needed something to drink. Checking up on a table a few times is reasonable, but 15 times was a little overkill. So unfortunately I was unable to enjoy my meal to its full extent. Ironically, by the end of our meal there was no one around for us to ask for the check and we had to wait a while. Among all the Boiling Crab restaurants I have dined in I'll have to say this particular one did not impress me. The bottom line is the food was okay and service was sub-par.",

My family and I were thinking it was going to be a small portion but boy was I wrong. 1 lobster, 1 dungeness crab and 2 lbs of shrimp was enough for us. I will be definitely coming back here. 5 stars!",

    "text": "Boiling Crab is california Version of Hot & Juicy both are comparable in Cuisine, the price though for Boiling Crab is cheaper than Hot & juicy. Now Hot & Juicy definitely has a competitor in the cuisine that they serve. Food is good, but then which food isnt good especially when its packed with Cholesterol :). The service is good and the place is huge. The restaurant can handle huge amount of Diners. So far on some of the comments that the service might be subpar, when me and my wife dined there the service was pretty good.",

    "text": "So I was a little concerned about seafood spots in the middle of the desert... But I took a chance with the boiling crab. Went to the boiling crab on a Sunday evening, was told the wait was 45 minutes ended up waiting an hour. Place seemed pretty cool, lots of TVs all around. The server was friendly, nothing over the top. He explained the already pretty simple menu to us I guess because it was our first time at the boiling crab. I ordered a pound of shrimp with the full shabang I believe its called. Honestly, I was expecting lots of Old bay seasoning all over my seafood bag of goodness with my corn and potatoes. But it was just some spicy juice sauce or something. I dont know. It wasnt very flavorful honestly. I am assuming its because the juice couldnt get in to the meat of the shrimp it just covered the shells. I didnt finish it all because I was full fast off of my 2 cups of sprite I had while I waited for my food. Would I go again? Maybe if I was craving seafood with no other options. But for all of the great ratings I dont think its all that people are making it seem to be. But then again we are dealing with people that are living in Vegas with no other seafood experiences to compare it to lol besides the hot and juicy. Theres nothing like East coast VA/MD seafood!",

    "text": "Finally tried BC last night. I must say they do a lot right so let's start there. Great set up and size of the restaurant. Lots of tv's and parking. Service was good and friendly. OK the food. The crayfish where very good, cooked perfect and lots of garlic. We had shrimp good flavor but in the bad we will get to them. Catfish was cooked really well and tasted great. Last we tried the lemon pepper wings and I must say excellent. The fries are very good also.  OK let's get to the bad and why I probably will just stick with HJ. The crayfish where some of the smallest I have ever seen. Worst part of the meal was the shrimp. Good size but they are next to impossible to peel. I sent the 2 pounds back and I never send food back but I had to. Server was nice but never eating seafood she didn't understand. There then brought us a new batch but only 1 pound. After a long conversation they brought another pound. I will give it to them the new shrimp where much better and not over cooked. Still hard to peel it was strange. Now this is where many places just don't get it not once did a manager come by our table and ask if they got it right or to say sorry. Sad that they get so much right but probably cost them self a couple dozen customers. I wouldn't say I won't go back but I just don't know why I would.",

It is the only boiling crab in las vegas so even tourist are bound to visit. I usually stuff my self with a 2 pound shrimp and 1 pound clam, good $30.00. Usually get WHOLE SHA BANG!! And mild spicy! I love spicy but rather not have the morning runs LOL! Prices here are affordable so dont be scared! LOL! Restaurant was themed for a outdoor fisherman eatery kind, so you will feel that outdoorish type LOL! Oh please bring a marker so you can write your name in the wood around except the tables of course or bars! Just make sure you dont write your gf's name with yours because one year later lol you might still see it and it can cause drama. Hmmm!! Servers a bunch of cuties especially now summer is here so everyone needs to work and make money while college is out! Ill add one last thing, make sure you wash your hands and literally scrub it hard lol. Because the smell of the sauce will stay over night, so make sure you do not go clubbing or anywhere else. This is a last destination and surely will not get you laid if it your first thoughts of a first date!!!!",

I was flabbergasted to find these little pip-squeaks with tiny, itty-bitty tails with what appeared 1 or 1.5 cm of meat.  WTF?  The crawfish at Hot'n'spicy had at least 5 or 6 cm of meat.  The waiter said they were out-of-season.  Why sell them then?  I was blown away.  I thought I was in the twilight zone.  I would have given this place one star, but the waiter let me sub shrimp.  The shrimp was okay but there wasn't much sauce for dipping.  When I had the Hot'n'spicy Crawfish, the bag was filled with a thick, brothy sauce that I literally just ate like a soup, and it was mind-blowing.  The layout was better than Hot'n'spicy which is too cramped but there was a fly buzzing around which made it feel gross along with the stupid grafitti they allow you to put up all over the place.",

I don't believe that the food is that amazing that it warrants a 2 hour wait to get a table. Are there no other seafood places like this in the area?  I was visiting from NYC and we are really limited in seafood restaurants that prepare the variety of sea creatures the way they do at Boiling Crab. There may be one or two restaurants but what you'll discover is that the alright seafood comes at a steep price tag. Now that is a sucky combo. Needless to say... those restaurants are not generating lines out the door.  The reason I explain all of that is because my lack of access to sea creatures in a bag is extremely limited. So if I compare my previous experience in NY to what I recently experienced in LA - LA takes the win for sure.  But I just didn't get the hype. We were a table of 6 and ordered at least 1lb of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, basket of fries as well as the fried catfish. The service was great - very attentive and friendly. Fries - standard. Fried catfish - not too shabby!!! The batter was light and the fish was moist though sliiiightly undercooked. You can tell when the meat doesn't easily break when you try to cut through.   Oh - LONG LINES for the bathroom!!!!!!!!!! Everyone wants to wash their sauce covered hands and it's just one stall per gender. Not cool man. Get your customers another sink or some wet wipes!",

I ordered crab legs here and they were very good.  Not as juicy as I like, but still good.  And they were a bit tougher to crack open.  I ordered mild and that cleared my sinus since my allergies were out of control that day.  I also ordered Cajun fries, which I couldn't stop eating.  The seasoning is just right and had a nice kick.  Pricing is market price, so it fluctuates often.  They do, however charge for everything, water is .25 cents and all the sides-potatoes, corn, sauces cost extra as well.  Something that I really look for when I'm out is customer service and that was one of the down falls.  I ordered 1lb of crab legs, and while I was eating I wanted more, so I ordered more.  A worker came by and asked how we were doing.  I asked for another pound and she said ok.  Time rolls by- no legs.  Our waitress came by and I told her I ordered more and she said they were ready, but no one tagged it to my table, so they sent it back.  So I had to wait even longer, and by the time they landed on my table, everyone was done eating.  They were super friendly, though.  The restaurant is fairly large and open, which is good considering the aromas floating around.  I love places laid back places.  Plus, you eat with your hands.  They have TV's around for entertainment and scribbles on the wood panels.  On the way to the restroom I passed a beam with people I knew which put a smile on my face.    Totally worth smelling like garlic sauce the rest of the evening.",

If you didn't, or just missed the first seating, you'd be subjected to about a 1/5 - 2 hour wait. The San Jose BC workers were also mostly teenagers who liked talking to themselves as opposed to following up with what customers wanted. To avoid this, I'd end up going to similar places (Red Crawfish, Crawdaddy, making it at home etc.), but nothing really compared to that whole shebang flavor.   This is why the Las Vegas BC is definitely a welcomed change of pace - the workers are young here too, but they are really on top of things. The dining room is also huge with 30+ flat screens showing a ton of different things - sports, cartoons, news, etc. Food is just as good without the hefty wait, and if there is a wait, the waiting area is indoors with a bunch of TVs as well. Looks like this is a popular place to have big group outings and celebrations, too. They also don't charge 25 cents for water like other BCs do.. at least for now :P",

I love the waiting area with customers leaving their names on the wooden walls. The host was very friendly and had us seated in 5 minutes on a Sunday night. My server was funny by trying to put on my bib for me and I was scared she was going to choke me not knowing it was my first time . After working my fingers by peeling the shrimp and dipping it in lemon and black pepper sauce the rice becomes my second spoon by absorbing the sauce! I've never ate so much that seconds out the door I started stomach cramping, it was sooooo gud and worth it. Also a friend showed me to wash my hands with the left over lemon juice before using the wipes provided to help in removing the seafood smell.",

Location: This is by far the biggest boiling crab I've been to, and I've been to two in LA and one in OC. Yes this girl loves her boiling crab  Wait time: I love that this location hasn't become super busy like Hot & Juicy or the other boiling crab locations that have an hour wait for so. This place also has a huge waiting area with TV's all around.   Food: Like I said... YUMMMM, only thing i'd change which has been bothering me is.. the SHRIMP. I think they over boil it because MAYBE ITS JUST ME. But every time I go I have a hard time peeling the shrimp. The skins stuck on the shrimp, this only happens when shrimp is OVER BOILED when cooked.   Price: Its actually cheaper than Hot & Juicy I believe, when I went a pound of shrimp was 9.99 apposed to hot & juicys at 10.99. I know $1 wow but I notice I spend a lot less at boiling crab than at hot & juicy. Maybe its ust me",

    "text": "The great debate is over! I've finally dipped my sinful fingers in a one pound bag of shrimp, drenched with SHABANG sauce. The controversal question that lingers everyone's mind is...HOT AND JUICY OR BOILING CRAB? Who is the king of ocean shell eats?!?!?! A great first for me tonight at Boiling Crab, and I must confess, my heart is in the middle.  I'm at a 50/50 decision here where one seafood joint outruns one trait and another for something different.  Here are the pros and cons: While the 1 pound shrimp may feel like you're being swindled in quantity, I think the quality of shrimp cancels it out. The shrimp SIZE is big. Which I am thankful for since it requires less work in peeling shrimp, and the taste of wonderful shrimp does suffice at every bite. It gets discouraging sometimes peeling small shrimp, and feeling like you didn't pop enough shrimp in your mouth to enjoy it. The SHABANG SAUCE tastes different from HOT AND JUICY's house sauce. Shabang is a bit more tangy, salty, and less spicy. Which I actually love. If you're an indecisive person when pick a good sauce, pick the Shabang since it compiles all the sauces together. I went for mild tonight to be safe, and thankfully it wasn't as spicy as I would have assumed.  25 cents for a cup of water. This turned me off a bit since that was a first for me, and I always thought water is complementary in every restaurant. Also, I heard from my friends the catfish isn't that great. But, I think thats expected because fried catfish isn't fried catfish unless its from the south, or with a little soul!   Service was great! They were very friendly, and always returned with your requests promptly. The fun part is the idea of writing on the wall. I mean, you came, you saw, you conquered. Might as well let everyone know you were there!",

The food is great...but the service could have been better. We asked for some tools to break the crab open with and by the time they had grabbed the tools for us, the crab got cold.

The boiling crab Las Vegas is the worst. As suggested by other reviewer, the sauce is not good and food is over cooked. Yesterday, I ordered a dungernous crab and 1 pound of shrimp, but both of them are not fresh. It seems like that the shrimp is mixed up with fresh one and in-fresh ones. Today, I gave a try at Hot N Juice, which is much better than boiling crab Las Vegas. The sauce there is good. The shrimp and snow crab is fresh, Though I did not try snow crab at BCLV, I'll definitely try the strip location of Hot N Juice tomorrow. So, if you are a big fan of Boiling Crab San Jose, then you probably should switch for Hot N Juice at Vegas.",

    "text": "OMG, OMG, O   M   G! Thanks to all the Yelpers on here that convinced me to get the Whole Sha-bang seasoning. Yum! The dining room is huge, cool decor, fun patron graffiti. The staff is soooo nice and helpful. Love the menu. Prices are great too.  Got 1lb. of shrimp with the Whole Sha-bang, mild ( I like to taste my seafood), they were good, love that they leave the heads on. I think I can kick it up a notch and try medium next time. Also got an order of King Crab Legs since I never really get the opportunity to eat them otherwise. They were soooo delicious. I got them with garlic butter sauce only because I was afraid the other sauces would drown out the taste of the crab. Damn, I should've Sha-banged those legs! I was dipping them in the sauce from the shrimp. Oh well, I know better for next time but I was not disappointed in the least. BTW I've never been to Hot N Juicy.",

    "text": "So my hubby and I went here about 8ish on a Thursday night. We waited for about 15 minutes. We were seated and the waiter came directly to us in no time. I ordered 2lbs. Of snow crab legs which came up to about 32.00 bucks. I also ordered the Cajun plain fries which were good but a tad but too salty for my taste. This place is a nice size and everyone seems very friendly. I would highly recommend this place.",

We also knew it would be packed just because its boiling crab.   But when I say horrible service.. If we were that type of people we could've walked out without paying. We were there for about two hours from the beginning of ordering to when we left and saw our waitress all of 2 times, to take our order and give a drink refill. We had to walk up to another waitor to get our check.",

The whole shabang seasoning was great. The sausage were very tasty as well. The portion of crabs was smaller than I anticipated but tasted great. Overall, not too bad but I've have better at other crab houses not as well known.",

    "text": "So yummy but oh so messy.  A half dozen oysters, 1lb. of clams & 1lb. of shrimp in whole sha-bang sauce (Cajun, Lemon Pepper & Garlic Butter) with a side of Cajun fries and baby red potatoes, all at spice level 3 (mild but still has a little kick) & some sweet tea made for a delicious lunch today.  We went around 1pm, there was no wait & service was great.  Be prepared to work for your food if you order shrimp as you'll need to do a lot of shell peeling that will leave your hands all sauced up & greasy, probably best to dress down cause the plastic bib may not cut it. Our total came out to $50 including tip, which fed my husband, our 2yr. old & myself.",

    "text": "I went to this location Sunday night. I am from LA we went in a group of 22 as we were on vacation with our car club. The food was good but I would give 0 stars if it was possible for the poor service. We were suppose to be helped by a girl named Ashley who left multiple times having us to flag down a different server named Christian who was no better. Ashley forgot our drinks and when the bill came she signed it with her name and a little heart for the service she didn't do. She was no where to be found so another waiter took our payment. When we left she said we didn't pay and Christian all of a sudden forgot he took our payment. When they made us wait for 20 minutes they said  they were going to check there cameras just to be sure because our payment might have gotten mixed up in   there tip Jar. After a long wait they came back to shuffle through receipts. They said coincidentally where we were sitting the camera was broken so they have no proof of is paying. It was extremely inconvenient and embarrasing having our party of 22 wait outside for us because the employees were so careless they lost our cash payment and no receipts were found but put in the trash. The manager was no where to be found. Ashley, Christian and the management have extremely poor service and should not have been so careless. These employees should be taken care of accordingly.",

    "text": "Definitely a fun entertaining place and don't be afraid to throw shells on the table and get dirty! Glad I had the experience!  That being said however the food was just average. Love Cajun shrimp! So we ordered Cajun shrimp and catfish to share. The shrimp was good but once take the shells off had to dip in the bag for more flavor. Need a bowl to soak the flavor in after you peel... Peeling was easy but rather enjoy my Cajun shrimp on a plate. The catfish was good but too greasy and mushy on the inside.... I think that's what made me sick! Would have loved to try crab but it looked like way too much work! Oh and I even got shrimp guts squirted at me from across the table! Be sure to wear your bib! Maybe a raincoat!",
