    "text": "Truly, one can see anything at a high end restaurant - in this case... statuesque, overdone tall young ladies with copious makeup, walking awkwardly in stiletto heels with a group of much less decadently dressed older gentlemen...  And yet it did nothing to distract from the absolutely stunning meal and service that Robuchon provides.  I've now been to four of Joel's establishments - Atlanta (now closed), NYC (now closed), L'atelier in Hong Kong (now expanded).  I'm not sure why some open and other close, but it's certainly not because the food is poor in quality.  This particular meal was the Menu A with 2 appetizers, 2 mains and a dessert.  The Amuse Bouche was a Beet Gazpacho - the cheese that served as the contrast to the sweet beet added a fullness to the already complex beet that gave the gustatory tension that one expects from this class of cuisine.    I had the bacon bread and a croissant as opening breads, served from an old-world bread cart brimming with fresh, warm goodness.  The appetizers I tried were the caviar on crab and truffle/lobster ravioli.  Both were excellent, though I was a bit overwhelmed with the fullness of the bed of crab meat.  The truffle lobster ravioli was a good example of the near-fusion that Joel's dishes often have - flavours very reminiscent of asian dumplings in my book, which is not a disparaging remark in the least.  For the mains, I had the black cod which was moist and very welcome to the palate followed by truffled spaghetti.  Gloriously decadent, resplendent with razor thin wafers of tartufo nero (truffe noir), it was satisfying to the point of overwhelming.    Topped off with a glass of sabayon and berries, the meal was spectacular.  One can argue with the exact emphasis in any given dish, but there is unmistakable attention to detail and intentionality to every morsel.  Sumptuous violet couches, flowers with silvered glasses and grays yields a suitable backdrop to the dining and meticulous service.  Fully worth the price, and an intense enough an experience to ignore stranger patrons(patronesses).",

Let just say we were intimated at first as I was not wearing a three piece suit. But we sat up at the bar and immediately felt welcomed by the wait staff. The staff let me try foie gras then paired me up with some great wine and most of the items I tried didn't cost me anything, that's what you get when your nice to everyone I guess. But every single thing from the bread to the deserts was rich in taste and were five stars easy. This is one of the nicest 5 star restaurants I have ever been to in my life so far. Try the tea when your meal is done they have a lot of rare Asian varieties and are served from a cool looking iron pot. When in Vegas and you got the clams to spend check this joint out I'm glad I did.",

Well, money my dear, can certainly make my tummy happy.   16 course meal, I can't even begin to list every item. 4 hour meals are best enjoyed with good company.  By the 10th course I was ready to unstitch my dress, take off my heels and call it a night. Of course being in vegas, bedtime is no time. My group of 8 girls really enjoyed their meal--with wine and lots of it. You'd think a bunch of skinny Asian girls wouldn't be able to hang. You're so WRONG!   Service was superb. Decor elegant.",

    "text": "Let me start off saying that 2 years ago my husband and I had a spectacular dinner at L'Atelier by Joel Robuchon and finally got the \"Time\" to visit Joel Robuchon.  We got a limo service and a nice tour inside the mansion of Robuchon which was very memorable and the hostess escorted us to the dining area.   Decore: In comparison to L'Atelier this place was much more chic and elegant. However, I still loved the idea to see all the chefs preparing and decorating my plates at L'Atelier.  In other words, great ambiance.  Food: This time we decided to go with the $275 Menu per person since 16 course is always a bit too much and good thing we did so. Amuse Bouche was beet gazpacho soup and it was remarkable. Since we were with 4 people we decided on getting different dishes to taste most of them. We got 2 appetizers, 2 entrees per person and a dessert. The entrees that I picked were Chilean Seabass and Beef Cheeks. Let me tell you Im not really sure if I loved the seabass but the beef cheeks were the best I've ever had, it melted in my mouth and I took the taste with me. The dessert was Sugar Sphere that included sorbet inside which was also super delicious and refreshing. Plating of all the dishes was out of this world detailed and beautiful.   We got a bottle of 100 yrs special Martel Cognac and it perfectly complemented our choices of food including the Black Cavier and Foie gras dishes.   The service was impeccable, we had the cheese tasting and bread cart would constantly offer to refresh our bread basket...   In other words, yes you do want to experience Joel Robuchon's 3 Michelin star restaurant and yes you will get your money's worth through experience, elegance, luxury and of course a taste of art.",

I probably ate half the cart.  Sabayon - The best dessert I have had in a while.   The meal was fantastic. I can't think of any negatives to point out other than the fact that we were seated in the garden rather than the main dining room. The garden itself was still neat. It had a wall of living plants.

The attention to detail in every course was amazing.  The flavor combinations they were able to create while keeping the dishes \"light\" was amazing.  We had the prefix 16 course meal which included everything.  It's one of those places  that I don't think I ever need to go to again, but would have missed if I had never made it    there!!  Make your reservation way ahead of time and ask to sit \"outside.\"  It's quiet and worth it!  Also ask for the complimentary car service when you make your reservation.  They only have three, we heard about it from yelp but missed out!",

The service was impeccable (one of the servers even recognized us from a previous visit), and the sommelier Niko (pronounced Niku) was exceptionally helpful recommended wines we'd like based on our preferences. I have to be honest though, as good as the food is, my favorite part of dining here is the bread cart selections, and the butter and olive oil are the best tasting I've ever had.  I would be happy to eat just bread and butter here all night! :)  This is truly a bucket list/once-in-a-lifetime/very special occasion place that I cannot recommend more highly.

There was only one thing on the menu that I wasn't a fan of (Uni) which they were happy to substitute for something else.  The flavors of each item in each course blended well together. The textures were diverse and pleasurable.  There was an undertone of Umami through most of the dishes which tied them all together.  I'm a big guy and often leave tasting menu restaurants feeling like I'd like to finish the night off with a good greasy cheeseburger from the fast food joint on the corner.  Not only did I not feel hungry at the end, but I was offered more food than I could eat.  Tip: take it slow, and easy don't gorge yourself in the beginning, because the desserts are *awesome*.  They're both beautiful and delicious.",

    "text": "If you want to truly feel like royalty, you must come here and order the 16 course Menu Degustation.  From the moment the doors are opened by beautiful hostesses, you feel like a King and Queen. For the next 3 hours, you forget that you are in a casino.  We were led to an intimate corner table with lush velvet purple chairs and throw pillows, surrounded by beautiful art.  Even my purse had her own royal chair. We were handed the extensive wine list (which weighed about the same as my 6 month old son) and the knowledgable sommelier directed us towards some wines that we might like. There were probably 8 servers doting on us, refilling our water glasses, laying new silverware for every course. I am a big fan of the show \"Downton Abbey\" and I could have sworn I saw Mr. Carson and Mr. Bates dressed to the nines, carrying a large silver tray.    Everything is just so decadent.  The bread cart and sinful french butter set the tone for the gastronomical adventure that awaits.   Black truffles, Caviar, Uni, Fois Gras...I was in heaven. And each were presented as a work of art.  The infamous desert cart carrying 35 different types of bite sized desserts, included chocolate eclairs that are heavenly.  If I had not indulged on 16 courses, I would have easily devoured a dozen of those eclairs.  I was most impressed when a cart of potted herbs was rolled to our table and we were asked if we would like some tea.  They actually freshly picked spearmint leaves and mashed them before my eyes to brew a beautiful aromatic pot of tea just for me.  Add some of the fancy honey and it was the absolute perfect way to end such a gluttonous feast.    This particular 16 course tasting menu had some items that blew my mind and some that were just okay.  My husband wants to return for our wedding anniversary, but we will probably order the 4 course meal instead. We will probably ask to be seated in the outdoor garden terrace next time. And maybe we will return in April instead since that is one of the 4 times that he is supposed to make his visit- with hopes that we can shake the hand of this culinary genius. There is no doubt that Joel Robuchon is deserving of the \"Chef of the Century\" title and I consider myself blessed to have experienced his creative menu.",

Yes, i expect perfection at a place like this.     I've eaten at Cut, Spago, L'Atelier, Melisse, Providence, Ink, Studio, Broadway, Craft Steak, Mar'sel, Volt, the London, etc., etc. and I have to say, this is the best meal I've ever had in my life.  In every single tasting of the 16 courses you can see, smell and taste True artistry at work.  Some people might say a 3-Michelin star restaurant is never up to that standard, and typically I would agree, but in this case I've experienced a True maestro at work.    If I could characterize each dish the common theme would be that Robuchon leaves nothing to chance and achieves perfect balance.  He deftly combines every pristine ingredient known to man such as truffle, caviar, and gold (yes, I said GOLD) with his psychotic attention to detail and ingenious creativity to create masterpieces on a plate.  There is a reason Robuchon was voted chef of the CENTURY, and now I know why.  Every chef that follows has been touched or influenced by his genius in one way or another and owes him a debt of gratitude.   I paired the wine tasting with the 16 course tasting menu and it was--simply put--the best meal I've ever had.  Was it worth the 4-digit price tag?  Only time will tell, but I can confidently say that I wasn't disappointed.   Service?  Impeccable.  Absolutely the best, friendliest and attentive service.  5 out of 5 stars here.   William, the sommelier is very skilled.  In speaking with him you can see how he combines expert knowledge and a pristine palate to create an incredible and memorable tasting menu.

If you are fortunate to be able to afford a meal like this, choose Guy Savoy.  The service, food, and decor are a level above Joel Robuchon.  (I also found that L'Aterlier was also underwhelming.

    "text": "There is absolutely no reason to go to Joel Robuchon unless you're curious about what it's like to spend a lot of money for hit-or-miss food and service that does not resemble a 3-star Michelin restaurant in the slightest.  I've eaten at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon in both Paris and LV.  I very much enjoyed both experiences.  I didn't feel like I over-spent for those experiences.  In fairness, I knew ahead of time that spending $435 for a 16-course tasting menu would probably be disappointing, because how could it not? It's $435 for a meal.  I was, however, hoping I might find something over the course of 3 hours to justify it.    The food: Within the 16 courses, I enjoyed the Le Caviar trio, the La Saint-Jacques (pan seared sea scallop), the Les Crustaces trio (crab and sea urchin, and I didn't actually like the sea urchin dish), Le Boeuf, and both desserts.  My sea bass was overcooked, and the foie gras in broth was one of the worst preparations of foie gras I've tasted; it was umami done wrong.  (L'Atelier has much better preparations.) The bread and sweets were pretty good, however.  But for $435 I should be lauding this place.  I had a better tasting menu at The Pass (non-Michelin rated) in Houston, and a better experience with service.  The service: It made me question the last time Joel Robuchon was reviewed by the Michelin Guide.  There was no finesse or fluidity to service.  I was privy to loud whispers between waitstaff.  The bread tray was constantly hitting the back of where I was sitting on its way to-and-fro.  And, to top it off, when a waiter picked up the signed check from the patron to my left (who, admittedly, got a little snippy with waitstaff), I could see him roll his eyes and huff upon looking at the check.  As a diner, I should not see any of this at any Michelin rated restaurant, let alone a 3-star.    Look, all this Michelin star restaurant stuff can get  pretentious.  I keep exclaiming about it because I'm beginning to think the emperor has no clothes with a lot of these restaurants.  In particular, Joel Robuchon.    But I would go to either L'Atelier again.",

This disgusting \"soup\" smelled like drain water in the back of a fish market, very off-putting.  The only decent portion of the bread cart was the salted butter that was served with it.

She was a well dressed Asian woman and from all appearences  it seemed like she had a good handle on her job.   I have been bragging up this place for years and some of my friends had asked for some photos of the interior . I got out my camera and snapped one photo and within a second she was over giving me a stern warning about taking pictures and how it bothered other eaters. While this does make sense to me , within the hour she was in the same space taking pictures of a very LARGE group of people. I guess size does matter!   As the night wore on it seemed like she was getting worse and worse! My wife at one point said\"I think she hates us\" .   Every time we had to ask for another piece of bread or a water refill it seemed like there was a great deal of reluctence to get her to do anything.   Now I could understand if we were at an I Hop and the poor girl had been on her feet for double shifts and had 15 tables,but as most of you know that is not the case at JR.  So we adjusted our $200 dollar tip down to $160 and paid our $1200 bill and vowed not to eat there again.   Its too bad,we really liked the Gold star service and quality of food!",

The service, the food...everything was awesome.  Only downside for me was that I had given my MLife card after the meal, and for some reason they didn't run it through - thus I didn't earn my tier credits for the meal. Have to go through the long process of getting MLife to give me credit, but would've been much easier if they hadn't neglected to run it through in the first place.",

    "text": "Wow, I don't even know where to begin. This place is on its own level of culinary experience. I've been wanting to try this place for some time and I'm a huge fan of his neighboring restaurant in MGM, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon so we finally got reservations on a Monday night. When we arrived, we immediately felt the elegance of the atmosphere...beyond hospitable staff, sophisticated decor, pink and purple florals weaved throughout the restaurant. We were seated in a private, more intimate garden space on the right of the restaurant. This was over the top fancy. They immediately brought over the menu, which gives you the choice of either the tasting menu for $445pp or various price point pre-fixe options ranging from around $200-300ish with supplement for many of their dishes. We chose to go for the tasting menu which is 18 courses and includes an insane bread and dessert cart like you've never seen.  So my night went something like this. - Le Caviar: Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab and a crustacean glee. This was the first dish of the night. Crab meat has a sweetness to it to counterbalance the saltiness of the caviar. The gelee brought a different texture element to the dish and it also helps that it's very tasty. - The first service (which contained three small plates) blew my mind. In particular the beet/apple tartare. Sounds like nothing much, but wow it was so perfectly balanced. The other two dishes of the service were marvelous too... potato salad with foie gras shavings and lobster raviolo. Never had lobster cooked so perfectly.... - The second service was so simple yet the flavors were so prominent. A perfectly fried frog leg with a garlic puree and parsley coulee for dipping. I don't usually eat meat, let alone frogs...and I could probably eat a plate of these. They were so juicy and tender. So so so good. The second dish of the service was a soft-boiled egg....perfect runny yolk with a black truffle dot all swimming in cheese sauce and spinach puree. - The third service is probably my favorite of the night. It was all these delicate seafood that are all my favorites. Seared scallop in green curry. Nice subtle kick to it. Truffled langoustine ravioli with simmered green cabbage...omg I think this have to be my favorite bite...it was so luscious, rich, creamy with perfectly cooked langoustine. Third plate: flan of sea urchin with light star anise foam...this dish was so interesting...nothing I've never had before. It's like an air-y cake-y uni goodness topped with foam and a whole piece of fresh uni....heaven... - The fourth service. This was when I started to get really full and I wished I ate a lot less for breakfast in preparation for this meal (and maybe less bread from the cart). This service included a grilled foie gras, black cod, and grilled lobster. Highlight of this course: foie gras....best I ever had. - The main full-entree course came next. Now I was painfully full. But it was so delicious. My boyfriend got the beef chop which they brought over and cut it table side...really nice presentation. I substituted the course for a sea bass with lemon foam. Fish cooked perfectly. Dish had great balance and freshness. A dollop of Robouchon's signature buttery smoooooth potato puree...ugh too good.  - The dessert comes in three rounds....the first is a service of three little light dessert bites that served as palette cleansers. All very good and much what I was craving for. Then they bring over this cocoa pod semifreddo...BEST DESSERT EVER. I was no longer full when I was having this.....I finished this with ease. Then when you think you're all done, they pull over a crazy dessert cart full of candy, chocolate, mini cakes, macrons, and much more. Quite overwhelming. I had our waiter pick his favorites from the cart. My favorite was this little cute lady bug chocolate. I was just ready to unbutton my jeans at this point. I should've wore my fat pants or a free flowing dress for this one. - They leave you with a parting gift of a medium sized lemon cake and a copy of the tasting menu....cake was so so so good. The waitstaff was amazing. This is the best service I have ever received in a restaurant, and of course, you don't expect any less from a 5-star restaurant.",

    "text": "I regret giving 5 stars to all my other reviews, because Joel Robuchon is the best  restaurant I've ever eaten. To put it in perspective, Gary Danko in SF is like Mcdonalds compared to Robuchon. Canlis in Seattle is like a Red Robins. I have been completely blown away to a new level.  Robuchon will pick you up and drop you off at your hotel in their gold MGM limo. You will use the Mansion as the entrance and the exit, and it will take your breathe away. I felt like I was in a movie star's house as I walked through the corridors. Unless you are a whale and get invited to stay at the mansion, there will be no other opportunities to see the inside.  The restaurant itself was beautiful, the decor is top notch. My bf kept saying he feels like he's in a movie. Of course they use Christofle silverware, you wouldn't want to eat on any other kind of metal. All the staff were attentive and knowledgable, especially the guy who explains all 40 mini dessert to you!   My bf and I both did the $195 5-course meal and it was more than enough food. I dont know how other do the 14-courses! Our favorites were definitely the chestnut foie gras soup, the Spaghetti uni and caviar ($45 addition) and the chocolate souffle ($15 addition). Never had a souffle cooked to such perfection.   I loved the bread cart, managed to try one of each.  We are not wine drinkers so I ordered a bellini. Oops, that was $35... they must have used real champagne. Also got jasmine tea with desserts and it paired well with the sweets.    To take home you get a souvenir booklet of the food you ate, as well as a loaf for next morning. Dinner ended up to about $700 for 2 after tax and tips. It was worth every penny.  I will be back eventually for their 14-course menu, without a doubt. It will be hard to top Joel Robuchon. Food, service and ambience is out of this world.",

I could probably eat a pound of sevruga, wash it down with a nice Bollinger vintage, and get away with a better deal.  Service was stilted, unnatural.   The place looks like a bodouir and they need to redecorate swiftly. I could seriously imagine a Romanian prostitute dressed like Mary Poppins waltzing by and offering her services in fake french.   The sommelier was a disaster. An arrogant Frenchman who left little doubt that he is lacking in emotional intelligence. Come on, p.rick, you are there to ADVISE, not pull a H.itler. I was footing your paycheck here, half a months worth probably.   The guy on the table next to ours brought his own bottle of Mouton, and washed it all down alone while his wife had at least three Manattans.   Did this experience expand my culinary horizon or create an inner zen-like state: NO.  Was it worth it: Are you kidding, of course not. We can FLY to Chicago, eat at Alinea and still pay less, flight included. And I guarantee, the experience is better.   My advice: go next door to the Atelier. Much more manageable and better, IMO. And costs only a few hundred bucks ;-)",

    "text": "In May my husband and I went to Las Vegas for the Uncork'd Las Vegas event.  While there, we decided to tack on an extra day specifically so that we could dine at Joel Robuchon.  We are both dedicated foodies and while far from experts, we truly appreciate a good meal.  The dining room at Robuchon is exquisite, with purple velvet sofas, coordinating chairs and yellow and white flowers.  The chandelier over the main dining room is divine, and I couldn't stop staring at it.  The menu is divided into number of courses.  You can order a 2-cours, 4-course, 6-course and the entire degustation.  Typically we would have ordered the 16 course degustation, but decided it was cost prohibitive being that we had already spent a considerable amount on the event that we were attending.  Instead, we opted for a 6-course menu.  The food was very good, notably my husband's Langoustine Ravioli.  I was also impressed by the bread cart, the cheese selection and the mignardiise selection.  It was lovely to have so many choices.  We also had 2 glasses of wine each, one to compliment the earlier, lighter courses, and one to compliment the later, heavier courses.  I won't describe each course as many have already done so.  Suffice it to say that Robuchon mostly lives up to it's reputation.  But overall, I would say that The French Laundry is better, and RM Seafood.Tru and Charlie Trotter's easily come to the same standard - and for less money.  Our bill was just over $1000, compared to the $800 we paid at The French Laundry for more courses and what I think was better food.  Given the choice to do one of the two restaurants again, The French Laundry would win, hands downl",

    "text": "Where do I begin - this place defines amazing...  I guess I'll start with the single disappointment - the limo rides are not offered on fight weekends, so just be aware that you may or not get to arrive in a limo if it is a busy event weekend.  Now on to the food!  My friend and I both chose the tasting menu. (How could you pick anything else, right?)  They started out by bringing the bread cart around. As everyone else has mentioned... this cart is a sight to behold! bread, and more bread! Be sure to get the brioche and the bacon bread. All of them are winners... but those two are particular stand outs.  The dinner then moved to the variety of courses. Our favorites: Le Caviar (Caviar done three ways)  La Courgette (Slowly cooked zucchini with fresh almonds, bacon and curry)  Le Veau (Sauteed veal chop with natural jus and pesto vegetable taglierinis)  La Mangue (Layered mango variations, strawberry gelee, almond cake) - This was the best dessert I've ever had in my life!  Plus many other dishes. The only dish that I had serious difficulty with was the \"chaud-froid\" of sea urchin on fennel potato puree with anise orange. The texture was just awful.   At the end of the dinner, they then bring around the tray of escortes de mignardises (mini desserts) WOW. Be sure to ask the waiter or waitress for their favorites. They did a great job steering us away from a few of the prettier but less tasty ones. The pear jelly was simply divine, and apparently has to be made throughout the night since it won't even last for an entire dinner shift.  They will ask you if you want tea - SAY YES. This isn't just loose leaf tea. They bring an entire rack of fresh herbs to the table, and proceed to cut and then emaciate the herbs and make utterly fresh tea. I had the lemon basil tea - crazy good! You might wonder - is this included in the main tasting menu? Yes, yes it is. Unlike the water ($10/bottle) tea is included.  In short - this is a great place to go for a special occasion. It's a bit of a crazy cost, but it's worth every penny!",

We have eaten at other 3 stars like Le Bernadin in NYC and Meadowoods in NAPA and they are all awesome, and all have unique qualities. But the dining \"experience\" is unmatchable. Between the decor, the service, the overall atmosphere is feels like dining in an era from the past. Anytime you are eating at 3 Michelin Stars and you think the food or service is bad - something has gone terribly wrong or you need to stick to the Steak N Shake. These places don't make mistakes, and their food never sucks. I would rate this restaurant as the #1 dining experience in the USA.",

We wanted to spoil ourselves silly and while our hotel accommodations sucked, Joel Robuchon was SPECTACULAR!!!  The six of us enjoyed ourselves and dined like princesses.  The churned butter shavings were just as amazing as the bread cart.  The attentive service was phenomenal - each and every person had a task and they executed each task with amazing timing & precision.  There was one server bringing the dishes from the kitchen just to the edge of the dining room, one person that would carry the trays from the dining room to the edge of the table, your server serving each dish from the tray... I could go on and on about every single person's role in this establishment!   The attention to every detail, every dish, every presentation and every flavor is just breathtaking.    We missed out on the limo ride and walk through the mansion. It sounds like an amazing experience!  (Next time, we'll have to ask for that service when we book the reservations.)  We enjoyed the ellaborate candy cart so much so that we were all presented with Joel Robuchon candy bars as a parting gift!  HEAVEN!!!!

    "text": "My dining experience at Joel Robuchon started with a ride in a gaudy-ass gold-colored limo with leather top.  No joke.  The limo was right on time (as opposed to being five minutes late like us), picked the four of us up in front of our hotel and whisked us to The Mansion, a part of MGM that perhaps 98% of Vegas visitors have never seen, heard, or set foot on (present company included).   So we were taken to this gated entrance, cobblestoned driveway (which was not exactly fun to navigate in 5\" red soles) and lush indoor garden surrounded by balconies from the 29 plush suites (which apparently requires a line of credit of $300,000 to qualify to stay).  Then we were ushered by our hostess through the corridors flanked by high roller tables and $25 slot machines, directly to the heavy doors of Joel Robuchon.  Behind the heavy doors was a small yet whimsical space dominated by purple and black velvet - opulent almost to the point of gaudy (but not quite!) - and  filled with hushed conversations of other dinner patrons.    Then it turned into a French lesson.  The hub, fortunately, is fluent in French (or should I say Canadian French), having born and raised in ON so it was somewhat interesting hearing him converse in French with the server and maitre'd.  Thankfully, the menu contains English translation and the server does speak English with a lilting French accent, so it didn't end up being too embarrassing for the rest of the group.  We unfortunately did not have enough time for the $350 / 16-course menu so we settled for the five-course a la carte menu of l'amuse bouche - a serving of delicious, delicate black caviar which I could've had three of; appetizer (the French, just like the rest of the world outside of America, calls this part of the meal entree.  For the Americans who do not believe me - I kindly refer you to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEntr%25C3%25A9e&s=4779de3b25be5f7f7e2294539d126a918838cf5826fec89e6f532c254f817835\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En...</a>); soup; main course; dessert; and finally moka and the (coffee and tea) with petit fours.   As soon as we ordered, we were approached by a smiling server pushing a bread cart filled with what could've been twenty different kinds of petite carbohydrate goodness.  Between the four of us, we had saffron focaccia, basil focaccia, bacon-filled bread (which we verified is not French, but rather a genius creation of the chef), and lots and lots of traditional French petit pain.    The rest of the meal was a revelation that we were oohing and aahing throughout.  My appetizer consists of king crab with cauliflower cream and seasonal vegetable - an unlikely combination that turned out to be delicious and refreshing.  For soup, I had the light, frothy and fluffy chestnut cream with foie gras, bacon bits, and lardons foam.  Then I had the braised veal cheek with galangal-and-ginger-infused Thai broth, vegetable couscous and brocolli as the main meal and finally a banana creme caramel with yuzu ice-cream, whose tanginess went really well with the crunchy sweet honeycomb candy.    We sat back, sated and content while waiting for our server to bring out the coffee and tea.  Ordinarily I would've chosen a pot of green tea to cap off the meal, however the experience was anything but ordinary so I settled for a strong, black French press coffee, hold the cream and sugar.    The bitterness of the coffee complemented the petit fours that we had a lot of trouble selecting from the 45 available on the cart.  My absolute favorite was the blueberry opera cake and eclair, although the strawberry cheesecake dipped in white chocolate was pretty darn good as well.    As we were paying, the same hostess who greeted us at The Mansion came right by, advised us that the limo is ready, and off we went to our next stop: XS.",

    "text": "Our experience did not start off well. I called the restaurant the morning of our reservations (booked a month in advance) to coordinate our limo ride, but to my surprise, they could not find our reservation! Panicked, I double-checked my email confirmation and gave them my confirmation number. The reservation was definitely nowhere to be found. Thankfully, there was an opening for the same night, though the limo service was all booked up. I wouldn't normally have been bummed about it, but I read all the glowing reviews mentioning the secret Mansion, which I did not want to miss. The concierge later told me that my reservation was cancelled, but do not know why.  Despite the disappointment, we ordered the 16-course meal, and enjoyed every bit of it. Food, service, and presentation were all wonderful. I couldn't help but compare to others (like French Laundry, Alinea, Benu, etc), and found the service to be slightly off. Uneven pacing between courses, awkward periods when service people would congregate near our table and chit-chat. We're nit-picking, but I do not expect that type of thing at this caliber restaurant. Our main server was quite good though, and made our meal less stuffy than it could've been. Yes, the dining room was quiet, but there was music playing and the volume of others in the dining room picked up throughout our 3 hours there. Another picky thing is that I didn't necessarily like the strange photos as part of the place-settings, accompanying a few of the dishes.  I did like the bread and dessert carts. The Langostine ravioli and caviar dishes were stand-outs for me.  Overall, a good experience and worthy of a 5 star review. I would not return for the $395 menu, but maybe one of the smaller meals, and hopefully be able to get a ride to the mansion next time.",

We brought a bottle of DRC St Vivant in, so $100 corkage is a steal for us.  I can see the bottle on a restaurant like this going for $4K.  So so yourself a favor bring in a nice burgundy it will hold up to most of the dishes served.  Spoke with the Somm he was very knowledgable.    The spiney lobster dish with black truffle was a stand out.  My beef cheek dish was amazing too.   The star of the show was definitely the Souffle.  So yummy.  It is a great dining experience as Joel put his name down to the restaurant without turning it into a gigantic restaurant and retain it coziness and charm.",

    "text": "Loved the Limo ride to the grand entrance.  MUST do this if going there for first time.   This is a belated review.  So, it will be based on my memory.  Most unforgettable dish for me was the foie gras  and duck dish.  Most amusing to me was the display of the dessert cart.  But, the cheese cart wins!  It was heavenly to taste all the cheeses.  I ordered a wine by the glass.  Server did not pour me a taste.  It turned out acidic and not-quite-drinkable.  So, we asked for a different glass.  She was reluctant.  Which is why its got 4 instead of 5 stars.  Come on.... this is a $1000 meal... you want to force me to drink acidic crappy wine?  How is that going to help me enjoy the rest of my evening?  But that was a small glitch.  Because everyone else was great and I always love places that give me a gift to take home. =)  Overall = Win!  Its a great splurge.",

    "text": "Well this was an experience!  We arrived by limo and went through the back way. If you are early you can do pictures at that point or at the end. We were seated in the \"garden\" which was nice for privacy but not as much action. Ask when you make reservations to sit where you want. We elected for the \"four course\" $195 - which included amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, main course, and dessert. We also had bread, dessert cart, birthday cake options. We ordered one half bottle of wine for $30. Water was free (flat) . I thought the amuse bouche was 5* (a sangria type soup dish), the appetizer 5* (I had a citrus artichoke and lobster salad), the soup 4*, the main dish 3.5* (I had Langouste prepared a few ways - it tasted a bit overcooked and the description given to me was unclear), the dessert 3.5-4* (my husband liked his better than I liked mine - he had banana chocolate and I had orange cake), the cake 5* (a nice treat and a yummy birthday cake slice), the dessert cart 4* (a ton of selections - I wish I'd been able to try more!) and the bread cart 5* (best I've ever seen for selection and great flavor range - we had them give us three servings from the cart with multiple selections each time).  I'm glad we went and I'm glad I can cross a place like this off my bucket list - but I probably wouldn't return on my own dime and even someone else's, I might suggest somewhere else.  It is a very special meal, but it is very French and it does cater more toward older clientele.",

    "text": "Michelin states clearly that it awards its stars based on the FOOD.  For this, I agree that Joel Robuchon deserves 3 stars.  We had the four course menu and everything tasted superb.    Why the 2 yelp stars then?  Well, yelp describes the ambiance as \"romantic, classy, and intimate.\"  I disagree.  First of all, we (hubby and I) were sat inbetween 2 young couples who were each 1 arm's width away from us.  I was about as close to the two ladies on each side of me as I was to my companion.  You could hear every single word the 4 people around us said, and it was very awkward for all parties.  Definitely not romantic or intimate.  In addition, the restaurant is very bright.  I'm use to a little mood lighting, but this place had the fluorescents way up.  I guess one of the waiters overheard me complaining and said, \"The chef likes is bright so you can see the presentation of the food.\"  Well EXCUSE ME, Chef Robuchon, but I think I would be able to see your food just fine if it were a little more dim and really, I came here to EAT your food, not to SEE you food.  For us, fine dining is just as much about the experience and setting as it is about the food.  Maybe things would have been different if we hadn't been seated next to twenty-somethings celebrating an anniversary and taking pictures of each course and oohh and ahhing loudly next to us.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's sweet, I just don't want to be so close as to be included.  Tips: - Book the complimentary limo in advance.  We forgot to do so and they didn't have one available for us after dinner. - Go easy on the breadcart.  Hubby got overzealous and ordered 4 breads and could barely finish his meal.  Sounds like common sense, but hard to resist all those carbs when you're hungry. - Save a little room at the end for the chocolates, which are delicious.",

The food was good but not that memorable.  I remember the candy cart being very awesome but can't recall specifically any one dish that stood out. The atmosphere was very serious and formal which didn't really contribute to my enjoyment of the food that much.  I remember all around us people speaking to each other in low hushed tones as if we were in an art museum rather than a restaurant.  I feel that being in a setting where you must treat your meal with such reverence detracts from the food somehow; additionally service was coldly polite so that didn't help things. If you must, don't do the full menu, there were a lot of extras on the menu and its easy to get full before even the meat courses start.",

    "text": "I probably can't offer much about Joel Robuchon that hasn't already been said. My husband and I went for an anniversary dinner, and we went all out. We loved it for reasons I'll try to enumerate below. It should be said we adore old-school fine dining, which is increasingly difficult to find anywhere in the U.S. Every once in a while, it's wonderful to be doted on by a bevy of impeccable staff while indulging in a devastatingly expensive four-hour feast of the senses.   In a hurry? Need to catch a show? Offended at being told what to wear? This place is not for you. If you want spectacular food without the fuss, try Bouchon, Daniel Boulud, or even Michael Mina's joint right next door. They're all good, but they're not a life experience, and they won't constitute your entertainment and longtime memory of an entire trip. Joel Robuchon will.   It's the only three Michelin star place in Vegas, and the only places that come close are the two Michelin star places in town, and we've tried them all, including Alex (rest in peace). They're all wonderful, but none are like Robuchon. Again, that is not a slight on Picasso, Alex, or Guy Savoy. In fact, we had equally delicious food, remarkable service and a great experience at Guy Savoy - all while paying half as much. We loved all those restaurants.   None are quite like Joel Robuchon. We both had the 13-course degustation menu. We started with the excellent house champagne, Bruno Paillard. This review could get long and look more like it should be on Chowhound if I detail each course. I'll simply say that we're unabashed food snobs who've  eaten a lot of great things, and we were both blown away by the creativity, cleverness, artfulness, and quality at Joel Robuchon. The meal was delightfully paced as well, and somehow my husband and I managed to finish sated and not even close to stuffed.   The setting and service was above reproach, too. Given its location right on the floor of the MGM Grand, we had some concerns about the setting, but one readily forgets that. We found it elegant and romantic. Servers are friendly but not familiar. Things (utensils, bread, plates, courses, etc.) materialize and disappear right when you want them to, almost magically. You are never, ever rushed. The pacing is European and perfect for the cuisine. The sommelier was perfect, helpful and not interested in upselling (interestingly, wine is kind of a bargain at Joel Robuchon, at least compared to its retail prices).   The night ended fittingly, with several over-the-top flourishes. First the dessert cart rolled around with dozens of options (just point and it's yours). Next came the tea cart, which was delightfully absurd. You can choose from a standard list of dried teas, or they'll cut live leaves off the potted plants on the cart. We had spearmint and lemon grass, respectively. Once we assured our server we were satisfied, he returned with personalized menus of the meal we just had and what we would learn over coffee the next day was the best cherry-pistachio pound cake ever.   It's very formal, very fussy, and very European. It's not for everyone, but if I could add a zero to my annual salary, it would be for me a lot more often.",

I've done a lot of fine dining here and overseas and I have to say I was not fully impressed.   Yes the bread and the dessert carts were impressive and maybe the fact that they have 17 course meal grant them the right to charge that much, and I like the presentation of most of the dishes but I didn't find anything exceptional to be honest. I'm sure a lot of techniques were put into these but I would like to see something out of this world that I couldn't find from other fine dining places and I didn't find that here  I like the truffled langoustine ravioli the most out of all those 17 dishes.  Service was typical of those fine dining restaurants so no comment here. Decoration is nice and intimate. They also give you a parting gift, I got chiffon cake. This is a nice gesture that no other restaurants have done so far in my fine dining journey.  Overall a nice experience but I don't believe it was worth every penny.",

    "text": "Being dubbed \"the most expensive restaurant in the world\" by some, high prices coupled with 3 Michelin stars and a plethora of awards, the flagship restaurant of the \"Chef of the Century\" better deliver on every single front. Unfortunately, JR disappointed on a few points.  First off, they offer complimentary limo service, but don't advertise it freely nor did they even mention a word of it when confirming reservations days in advance. When we did come in for our reso, there was nobody at the hostess stand, so we waited for a bit before someone came. Once they did come, they didn't even greet us--just asked if we had a reservation and under what name. This is unlike other Michelin restaurants I've come to where they anticipate you coming from 50 feet away and open the door with a warm smile. Maybe I'm being fastidious in this regard, but I had high expectations from beginning to end when it comes to this place.  I must say, the decor is dripping in elegance and luxury. It is quiet, secluded and roomy enough to have privacy between parties and their conversations. The faint piano music goes perfectly with the romantic, high-class atmosphere. A complete contrast to the obnoxiously loud vibrancy of the MGM Grand.  Upon being seated, we quickly decided to get the full experience with the 17-course degustation menu. Being somewhat lightweights, we decided to forego the optional accompanying 3-tiered selections of wine pairings and, feeling rushed, opted for a few glasses that I chose myself to pair with the food. The sommelier brought our glasses with pursed lips and barely any explanation of the wines whatsoever--another contrast with what I've experienced elsewhere in the Michelin world. Surprisingly, they do allow BYOB, but with a major corkage fee, something close to $100.  The 17 courses didn't come out in 17 separate plates. They were combined together to form multiple small bites in several platings that helped keep our time there to under 3 hours. From what I understand, the menu changes slightly here and there every so often, including the price.  The magnificent bread cart entices the senses and helps engage the consumer with anticipation on what's to come. Their velvety butter is flown in from France and makes quite the treat when smothered on especially the bacon bread and Gruyere brioche. The first course started off with Robuchon's signature dish--caviar atop king crab in a fishy jello. Cold. Our particular meal included only one course of foie gras. Also cold. I dislike cold foie gras, so we were disappointed that for the caliber of this place, they didn't offer a hot version of foie gras in their large course menu. The truffled langoustine ravioli was soft, velvety and rich. The sea scallop was too salty and rubbery for my taste. The spinach-wrapped lobster was excellent. The caramelized black cod (which I was gleefully looking forward too) was unmemorable. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Kobe beef, so much that he ate half of mine! JR's signature whipped potatoes were an excellent accompaniment. The dessert platings were exceptional--beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. The mignardises trolley (dessert cart) had an alluring assortment of sweet treats to entice even the fullest of bellies. However, the macarons, which are a French specialty and therefore should be the best of the best, were stale, hard and chewy. Honestly, the worst I've ever had, sad to say.  I was also bummed that we didn't get to meet chef Joel Robuchon himself. Apparently he is only there a few times a year--understandably so since he owns several restaurants around the world. But at every other 3 Michelin restaurant I've encountered, we've met the chef, so I was a little let down.  JR wants 5 stars. I hate being the one to deny them of this small luxury. I guess high expectations lead me to be somewhat deflated about the whole experience, and feel like putting my money on Jimmy Walker winning the PGA Championship that weekend would've been a more gratifying return on a high-stakes wager.",

    "text": "A once in a lifetime meal experience...Eric R. asked me to pick one restaurant I had always wanted to try since I moved to Vegas 8 years ago.  Joel Robuchon was at the top of my long-term bookmark list, and he told me to make a reservation.  We missed out on the golden limo by one month as that service was discontinued - bummer!  We were seated in a corner booth, with a deep purple hue.  The restaurant is very intimate and from our corner we could see everything, including the private room through the window with a living wall.  We had several servers, one for drinks and desserts, one for taking our order, and one for breads and savory dishes.  We learned that most of the staff has worked there for over a decade together as a team.  I had a glass of Veuve Cliquot Brut and Eric R. had off-dry Riesling Kabinett.  Eric R and I opted for the menu that included a choice of appetizer and entree, and also included the amuse bouche, bread cart, and mignardises cart.  We tried several breads accompanied with the whipped butter and sea salt and Spanish olive oil.  I tried the saffron brioche, olive baguette, and gruyere roll to start.  The amuse bouche was a strawberry gazpacho with sheep's milk cheese, balsamic and pistachio.  It was very refreshing.  For appetizers, Eric R got the caviar atop salmon tartare with saffron and coriander crisps (for a supplement).  I began with the sea urchin and langoustine medallions in seaweed gelee and pureed cauliflower.  For entree, Eric R. ordered the roasted lobster with morels and asparagus in shellfish jus, and I got the caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy and freeze-dried lobster roe.  The entrees were accompanied by Robuchon's supposedly famous whipped potatoes.  Now I like potatoes but Eric R. doesn't.  We both tried them and both agreed they tasted like paste, that you may tile a floor with perhaps?  It was really a weird consistency and flavor, so that was yucky...at least that just came with the meal and wasn't our choice.  For dessert, we went wild on the mignardises cart.  I had yuzu truffle, pecan dark chocolate, coconut eclair, hazelnut macaron, and lemon meringue.  Eric R. got blackberry opera cake pecan dark chocolate, strawberry pistachio tart, strawberry margarita gelee, blueberry white chocolate cake, and a made-to-order mini creme brulee.  We finished the meal with a pot of gyokuro green tea.  It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful ambiance.  At the end of our experience, I was given a lemon pound cake as a parting gift.  I think it is a great place for a special occasion.",

    "text": "When you were a kid and first learned about the concept of fine dining, this restaurant is probably what you imagined in your mind. Lots of modern fine dining places feel a bit understated - Benu, the French Laundry, Quince, and Saison all come to mind - in their service and interiors, as if to suggest that all of your attention should be on the food. You will not feel that way at all walking into this revered establishment. If Louis XIV had a dining room from Versailles transported into the modern era this is what it might feel like. Bold purple and white colors dominate the main dining space with a tasteful ivy wall serving for contrast against the far wall - the interior broadcasts luxury before you even walk into the space.  I've been fortunate enough to dine here on multiple occasions and every element of the restaurant is best-in-class. Don't believe anyone who think this place has fallen out favor or changed, it is still the best place to eat in all of Las Vegas.  There are a number of food options to choose from but c'mon, if you're here you're doing it wrong if you don't opt for the 16 course degustation menu. It's expensive but trust me, it's worth it. Obviously the menu shifts various dishes in and out but some delicious regulars include La Langoustine, a remarkable lobster ravioli, an amazing preperation of the classic French scallop dish La Noix De Saint-Jacques (I've never had better), and the real star of the show, Le Caviar, a trio of the finest caviar dishes; even if you're not a caviar fan I guarantee this dish will change your mind entirely. The night begins with and is complimented with an over-the-top bread cart full of every kind of freshly baked bread you can imagine but the True piece de resistance as it relates to American palettes is the bacon bread - trust me, you'll want many of these before your meal is over.  I know the image I painted of this place is of an extremely classy fine dining restaurant and that can be intimidating to some. While it most certainly is that they also go out of their way to make each and every guest here feel amazing. Instead of feeling like you are out of place in a luxury fine  dining restaurant the staff do everything they can from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave to make your experience be as memorable and great as it can be.  Highly recommended.",

Then please, look no further than Joe Robuchon.  Touted with the coveted Three Michelin Star, Five Diamond Triple A rating and a wide range of accolades and awards, Joe Robuchon is the pinnacle of fine dining.  Before Joel Robuchon, I did not understand how wonderful our bodies were made, for us to be able to experience sensory reception at this level. And for a team of artists to be able to create such mind bending pieces is a site to behold. This was not a dining experience, it was a life experience. And  worth every penny to those who could afford not paying rent or skipping out on a mortgage for a month. Trust me, it's worth it.   Brava, brava.",

The inside of it is absolutely gorgeous.  Most of the tables have deep purple couches that are gorgeous and if it had fit in my purse, I might have stolen it.    Husband and I did the degustation menu (he did meat, I did veggie).  Save your pennies because this is expensive.  That being said, it is well beyond a meal and much more an experience.    I don't want to share too much because the experience is everything.    The food was a work of art and Robuchon is a master at drawing out every last bit of flavor in a particular ingredient.    I highly recommend the house cocktail (the French 75) to accompany your meal.  I like them but this was the best I've ever had.    Go.  Enjoy.  Make sure not to eat much that day so you can truly enjoy the 17 courses.  Savor the experience.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is a 3 Michelin star restaurant located inside of the MGM Grand hotel/casino.  If you plan on dining on the weekend, good luck on making reservations at the last minute.  They are always booked months in advance.  I finally made reservations on a weekday which was slightly easier even though the dinner times were still very limited.  That is how you know that this restaurant is good!  Surprisingly, the place does not make you leave a deposit while making reservations.  Instead, they will give you a call a day or two in advance to confirm.  Walking into Joel Robuchon was like walking into a princess's home.  Holy crap!  The place is gorgeous!  Whoever that decorated the place needs a raise ASAP!  In the main dining room, there is a humongous sparkly chandelier, and the whole place is tastefully decorated in silver, gold, black, purple, turquoise, velvet, flowers, and is bling bling!  Damn!  We were immediately seated and without having to request this in advance, my bf and I were led to a private room off to the side where there were two other tables.  This room was dimly lit, had a romantic atmosphere, had real plants growing, and the table decorations matched the room.  We were kind of speechless the whole time because the place is just breathtaking and beautiful.  Of course I was provided with a stool to place my purse on.  Our waiter then took down our drinks orders.  Remember, if you don't request tap water specifically, you will be given bottled water and be charged for that.  We were then presented with a menu and we knew ahead of time that we were not planning on doing the Menu Degustation which is 16 courses and would be +$430 per person.  We did this at Guy Savoy in Caesars Palace and thought we were going to explode from being so full!  Instead, we chose the menu that allowed us to choose 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, and seductive sweets at the end.  I like how this place has different menus and different prices depending on your budget.  We started off with the Amuse-Bouche and that was a toasted quinoa ball with fresh quinoa puree, tomato, and basilic!  Then came a cherry gazpacho with ricotta cheese sherbet, and pistachio.  This wasn't Campbell's that's for sure.  Next, a waiter came by and introduced us to some fancy butter and olive oil.  Another staff came by and brought a huge bread cart where we could select whatever we wanted.  Each bread had a different and unique flavor, but don't get too greedy and stuff your face in with bread otherwise you won't have room for dinner!  There was one that was so good and had cheese on the inside.  The tiny croissants were delicious too!  Appetizers that we ordered:  1.  An egg stuffed with crab meat on the inside and topped off with caviar on top. 2.  Some creamy white soup that looked like it had peas in it (sorry, my picture of the menu did not come out and I can't remember the name of the appetizer.) 3.  Truffled langoustine ravioli with simmered green cabbage. 4.  Foi Gras.  All of the appetizers were delicious. No complaints there!  I especially enjoyed the ravioli and the foi gras which was just perfect.  It was not overwhelmingly sweet.  The first main course were the marinated black cod was served in miso and had daikon and yuzu mousseline and the pan-fried sea bass with a lemongrass emulsion, and stewed baby leeks.  The second main courses were the grilled lobster with green peas and baby bok choy and the ribeye with mashed potatoes.  Both were soooo good!  For dessert, my bf ordered the Le Chocolat et les cerises griottines, comme une \"Foret Noire\" which is chocolate and brandy soaked cherry griottine \"Black Forest\" cake.  I ordered the La Sphere de sucre souffle, sorbet cremeux au citron jaune, basilic Thai en gelee which in English is Bubble sugar sphere with creamy lemon sorbet and Thai basil gelee.  The presentations of both of the desserts were so pretty that it was hard to just dig into them.  They were like art on a plate.  Flavorwise, I thought the black forest cake was okay and nothing spectacular.  The lemon sorbet on the other hand was outstanding!  It wasn't too sweet and the lemon and thai basil worked extremely well together!  Next, the large dessert cart came around.  There were mini macaroons, cupcakes, brownies, and etc. on it.  Everything looked delicious, but we were extremely full by this time.  After dinner, we were handed a to go bag with a nicely wrapped baked good on the inside.   Compared to Guy Savoy which is a 2 Michelin star restaurant, I felt that Guy Savoy was better at giving the customer the best fine dining experience because staff jumped at the opportunity to personally escort you to the restroom & back to your seat.  They even pulled your seat out for you!  Joel Robuchon's staff did not do that.  Instead, they pointed at the direction of the restroom and they didn't care to escort or pull your chair out for you.  Foodwise, Robuchon's dishes taste better than Guy Savoy's.",

    "text": "This birthday treat ended up being a truly unforgettable meal! The service was excellent, they were always available without seeming to hoover. The ambiance and decor provide a lovely backdrop for an even lovelier meal. It all starts with the bread cart which includes all manner of yummy, fresh, buttery, delicious options. They'll heat it up for you and the fresh butter and olive oil that accompany it will keep you coming back for more. You can have as much as you like, and they'll bring the cart by for repeat visits but at some point you will have to tap out and save room for all the other courses you have coming. Next up was an amuse-bouche, a cold corn chowder, soooo creamy and unexpectedly yummy. We opted for the 6 course option as 16 just seemed excessive (other options including a5 and 4 course are also available). Everything really was delicious but the standouts were the salmon tartar with caviar, the cod with baby boy chop and the RIB EYE!!!! Sorry, just drooled a bit...a perfectly prepared piece of red meat has been known to bring a tear to my eye. And this one was truly amazing, served medium rare, all of the fat is trimmed away leaving you with wonderfully marbleized, morsels of meat. I could go on, seriously but I think you get the idea, it was amazing, I can still taste it.  After the main courses I was sure that I had no room for dessert but somehow, I found room, over and over again. There was a sorbet, followed by a beautiful and delicious ice cream birthday cake and then the dessert cart which somehow bested the bread cart. I didn't realize I liked macaroons until I had these. The desserts are beautiful, little works of art with meticulous detail, you'll think to yourself 'this is far too pretty to eat' but after the first bite you know it's far too delicious not to. The macaroons, the creme brulee, the panna cotta, enjoy all the bites you can, each will be better than the last! The blow of the bill is softened by the mini loaf of pound cake, who doesn't like a little something for the next day?! My single criticism, if you could call it that, is the limited spirits. There's an extensive wine list but no cocktails. I love a good cocktail and was prepared to be wowed by their selection, I love wine so I managed but would've loved some fun drinks to accompany this incredible meal.",

I was disappointed when I did not enjoy two dishes that Joel served; Les Amandes fraiches and the Le Black Cod. Don't get me wrong, I loved everything else.

    "text": "We had the dinner with another couple on 7/1/18. The bill for four of us was over $3,000. I expect perfection for this kind of money, but it was close to perfection with a few misses.  We all had the 17 course tasting menu. Overall, the place is beautiful and service is excellent.  Of the 17 courses, I think the desserts were the most memorable. I believe the taste and the presentation is the best I have tasted and seen. The desserts were out of the world outstanding, especially the signature dish, butterflies in spring time. The dessert chef is a very talented one indeed.  Other than desserts, there are a few dishes I have issues with. First, the caviar course with crab meat was a beautiful presentation, but the caviar does not taste anything extraordinary. It did not have the caviar taste but rather it had no taste. I had better caviar at Ritz Carlton and French Laundry.  Second, the salmon course, the salmon should have a fresh crunchy taste like biting into a piece of sashimi, but I did not get that. It was a bit mushy. I would much prefer more firm.  Third, the langoustine course had the same issue as the salmon. I would have liked it more like the Ebi shrimp in Japanese restaurant. Again, meat is not firm but rather soft and mushy.   In comparison with my favorite restaurant, French Laundry, which I have visited on many occasions, I think French Laundry has a better tasting menu overall, but Joel Robuchon wins on desserts hands down.  It was certainly an experience and worth the try. The next day, we went to Ohlala in Summerlin Vegas. The bill at the bistro was $300 including wine, tip and tax. It was not as high end as Joel, but the taste is Ohlala!!  A side note: While at Joel's, an Asian mid teenager and his eight year old sister sat next to us. They told they are from Vancouver. They were polite and well behaved. My issues are: 1) The teen was in jeans and a polo shirt while everyone else was in proper attire. The restaurant should have given him a jacket to wear and asked him to put on slacks. 2) Even though they were very proper young lads, where were their parents? Why were they dining at this ultra expensive restaurant by themselves? Their parents were perhaps high end gamblers, and the resort may have comped the dinner?  I would not be surprised if my guess is correct. Anyhow, the parents should have been there with the kids since they were really too young to dine at such a fine establishment.",

    "text": "Yes. I did stay at MGM just so I could be closer to my eventual meal here. 15 dishes minimum of food? I don't want to walk too far after that.   The larger the group, the longer the meal may take, just a heads up. 10 of us took just about 6 hours to eat! It felt much shorter because good company and food makes the time fly by.   Even though it's right in the MGM casino, the doors are an excellent buffer; I couldn't hear or see anything outside, so I momentarily forgot where I was.  Bring your eating pants. I ate so much I should have worn my eating socks. Special note: I was the only person in the group that didn't eat red meat, and they were careful to tweak each dish for me (!)  I watched the bread cart drive slowly around like a carb dream. Or, what I called it, a 'go-carb.' The variety was ridiculous: flaky croissant rolls, bacon ivy, their version of pao de queijo..Luckily, I was with regulars of JR who warned me against eating too much bread. This is sage advice.   If I described each dish individually, you could be here for 6 hours, so here's the high overview:  The uni (hit and miss with me) was fantastic, and was just the beginning of the beautiful plating experience. Fish 3 ways offered gold flake caviar with tiny drops of cauliflower around, lobster with corn chowder, and a salmon tartare. The fried chip was too large, salty, and oily for the tartare but it was still good.   Their take on eggs florentine was simple and lovely, the seared scallop was good, but interestingly, the soybean sprout risotto underneath was my favorite part! My friends are huge fans of the langoustine ravioli, and it was truly the best ravioli I have ever put in my mouth. I'm not sure where the langoustine began and the pasta ended.   It was served with a shaved truffle tart (mmm!) and something called 'mushroom royale.' It was only okay. Soupy, mushroomy, and...grey in color.   Sea bass with bok choy was followed by lobster with chestnuts. Not only gorgeous but perfectly flavored. And then came the duck. Duo de Canard with soured grapes and the 1:1 butter potatoes. A couple of folks I was with didn't like foie so I ate THREE servings YAY ME!   Dessert comprises 3 of the courses. Get ready. First, we had the cold-pressed pineapple and coconut lime 'tarts.' A great fresh intro to the next plate.   Second, we had the 'Black Forest' dessert. A miniature Little Red Riding Hood could have skipped through the tiny scene in my glass and I wouldn't have been surprised. (I secretly wished Mario or Luigi would 1UP.) Everything from the chocolate 'dirt' to the flowers was incredible.   We finished with the Barbie-sized desserts of every kind. Homemade jellies, teeny-weeny eclairs and tarts, pistachio nougat, truffles...Because we were a large group, we didn't get to pick each one wanted off the cart, but were instead given mixed plates on the table. Next time, I'll ask them to wheel that bad-boy around, large group or not. I mean, my experience shouldn't be any different than a 2-top, riight?   The funniest moment of the night was when I first went to the restroom. They have a full length mirror next to the toilet. Why anybody thinks I want to see myself use the restroom is beyond me, but made for a good selfie. (Don't worry, my pants are on.)   5-stars for sure. I'll officially add JR to my food rounds when in Vegas.  I wonder if they'll let me drive the bread cart?",

    "text": "I have held off writing this review for a while, as not loving this place causes me some major cognitive dissonance.  But, reviews are supposed to be based on our experience and, True to the star rating, I have experienced better.  Much better (and for much less).   The restaurant itself was beautiful and we were seated in what was made to look like an outdoor patio, though it was still indoors.  I'm wondering if this is where our problems started, as one of the major issues of the night was service.    We ordered the full 18-course tasting with the wine pairing. The presentation and artistry in all the dishes was amazing. Overall, I don't think I've seen a restaurant that can compete with what the food looks like (art on the plates, included).  But, I can't reward a restaurant just for aesthetics.  It is about the taste of the food, too.  Everything tasted fine to good, but very few bites were 'wow' level bites. Paying that kind of money, even if a dish is not innovative and new, it should still be amazing, not just ok.  The wine service was literally among the worst I've ever had. I've had better wine service from places that are BYOB! Numerous times our food was served long before we received the wine. I personally like to taste the wine before the food arrives, seeing it on its own; then, of course, I like enjoying it with the food with which it's been paired. Finally, after we had finished our main meat dishes and did not receive the wine to go with it, I had to ask for a manager.  By this time, I was super annoyed, as four courses had gone by with mediocre service and no one really seemed to notice or care.  This meal is a mortgage payment for some and was to celebrate my birthday.  (In fact, the dinner was on my actual birthday; they helped kill the celebratory mood.) While we wouldn't have been wowed with the food regardless of the service, we could've at least had a great night had the service team done their job.  After complaining, the manager was apologetic and provided us some upgraded wines for our last few pours. He also reduced our bill a bit (about one-third of the cost of one of the wine pairings); while it was a nice gesture, it didn't really feel like enough, considering how it impacted the night.  I'm glad we went to Robuchon, as we've been wanting to go for years; I do wish we hadn't gone on such a big occasion.  For me, the True test of an expensive restaurant is if I'll ever go back.  For this kind of money, I'm going to Eleven Madison Park every single time.  In fact, EMP is cheaper and infinitely better. If you really want Robuchon's food, go next door to L'Atelier: similar food, great views at the bar, and more attentive and fun service. If you just want good food in Vegas, there are sooooo many other options, both high end and low end.",

    "text": "This is what haute cuisine is about, imho.  My aunt and i were picked up by a limousine and dropped off at MGM mansion.  We waited for our hostess in a beautiful waiting room which reminded me of a small chateau in Europe.  The huge arrangement full of big pink peonies (one of my favorite flowers) graced the main entry.  We were then led thru many hallways, along with another couple, and finally to the restaurant off the casino side.  The dining room was scrumptously decorated with shade of purple and pink,  the chandeliers were lovely!  We chose the two couse menu with a supplement so we ended up trying 6 different dishes.    The bread cart was loaded with so many kinds that i had a tough time choosing since i did not want to stuff myself.   Once the selection was made the bread was warmed before they were brought to the table.  Each small piece was perfectly formed, really cute :-)  The amuse 'Le Caviar' of crab meat with fennel and dill cream topped with osetra caviar was one of the the best dishes that i've had (the other was probably Thomas Keller's terrine de foie gras).  The combination of ingredient was perfect.  Each of the flavors shined through without being over powered by the others.  The creamy texture of the crab mixture was nicely contrasted by the crunchy caviar.  The fennel gave the dish a pleasant aromatic feel which i love very much.  The portion was so generous but i think i could handle muuuuch more :-)  Les Crustaces (supplement): Roasted lobster on cauliflower with green curry, truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabagge (signature dish), delicate flan of sea urchin with mocha foam  For the entree i got turbot sauteed with matsutake which was excellent, my aunt got the seafood medley which looked pretty but  there was a weakness in flavor combination, imho.  The dessert cart was as i expected to see with at least 30 different choices of cakes, candies, chocolate.  The hostess patiently described many of them and each of us ended up with about 10 different kinds.  Each piece was exquisitely done in miniature form and delicious.  The food, the decor, the bread/dessert carts, the limousine ride showed that the 3-star Michelin restaurant like this stands in a different class compared  to other restaurants.  I really enjoy the whole experience which i think was well worth the high price of the dinner.",

The decor is elegant as to be expected and I agree with other reviews that I was surprised at how bright the dining room was, but trust me, you're going to want to see every single beautiful creation that you're putting in your pie hole!  I mean, for the love of all that is righteous, even the butter is a work of art.  No lie.  Our driver that evening told us to take it easy on the bread cart.  I should have listened to him, but I just couldn't help myself.  This place is the Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory of divine cuisine.  When someone's rolling out a cart of doughy goodness, you don't say no!  I had the cheese for dessert and weeks later I still weep because I miss it.  But it is the potatoes that accompanied my filet that I will never, ever, ever forget.  I can't even do them justice.    The presentation is out of this world.  The service is impeccable.  The food is created, plated, and delivered with nothing short of pure love.  A truly special place.  A truly special meal.  Now, let me get back to work so I can afford another trip to Robuchon!",

    "text": "This was clearly and bluntly a disappointing experience for an allegedly three star restaurant. My wife and I have experienced far better restaurants that were far from being hailed as the navel of French cuisine but certainly better in terms of quality of service and quality of the food. Spend your money elsewhere in one of the countless other signature restaurants in town, this one is probably just living of its past glories (if there have ever been any)  Location: the restaurant is situated literally off the gambling floor and is only separated from the hustling noise by a single glassed door. For that very reason of being close hurly-burly our dinner experience got the worse of a cowboy country band party that was taking place a few feet from the entrance. as such, the customary piano tones were more than disrupted by the hammering drums of the party next door. The place is brightly illuminated by a crystal chandelier that is not only the center piece of the restaurant but also setting the room in a bright light that is unheard of for fine dining. You can easily read your newspaper but a romantic dining experience did not emerge given the football atmosphere the light created. Guests are seated on plush sofas that on first sight looked inappropriate to sit through a whole evening but turned out to be more than comfortable.   Service: When we entered the restaurant we were rushed to hour table and seated. Our coats where only collected upon our friendly request that we would like to take them off. Our aperitif was served with a benevolent and friendly \"how are you doing\" but clearly not appropriate for this setting. Our waiter seemed blase and almost entirely after the amuse bouche. The bread service was taken over by a different waiter later on which was well executed. Upon leaving the restaurant there was not hostess or service to deliver our coats as the entry hall was left unattended.  Food: Without going into too much detail, we had a three course prix fixe menu that was clearly lacking any inspiration. The signature dish (mashed potatoes) contained far too much butter, which naturally resulted in very creamy consistency but demanded the company of bread. The use of brown butter for a quality puree has apparently not made it to this restaurant. The pork iberico has however been excellent.   Verdict: the service and quality of the food is clearly overrated. There are much better restaurants in town that rightfully carry a collection of Michelin stars. This restaurant is obviously living of its past substance and is far from being innovative. A clear no-go",

Was sort of a last minute trip and had a few options either Alize at the Palms hotel, L'Atelier, or Joel Robuchon's restaurant.  Luckily I was able to get reservations for Robuchon as it appeared it was fully booked for the night.  With that in mind, I opted to head there.  After reading some of the reviews, I made arrangements to have the limo pick us up which was nice and was able to see The Mansion at MGM.  If I only had enough money to be able to be invited to stay here...I'd be in heaven!  View of the courtyard inside (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=tlgIm9nOoOJZaihb6w1NTw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Being a person that doesn't eat a whole lot, we opted for the 4 course menu.  Extensive wine list (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=YPuqeZNxbriaW0JaTeyYgA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>)  Bread cart (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=MxkdAaMPda34ObPsLQGSiQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  I chose the saffron brioche, basil brioche, milk, and cheese breads (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=MxkdAaMPda34ObPsLQGSiQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  My favorites were the milk and basil brioche.  Served alongside is also a special olive oil and some hand carved butter (forgot where each was from)  Amuse bouche - le caviar (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=pQqA7f1E_OLIgZnUZ7A9Ow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  I believe it was yuzu flavored caviar with crab meat underneath (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=TsLBlrHnktmrfW0Sn7K6EA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  I'm not a fan of caviar .. but damn was this good.  The crab meat and caviar was amazing together!  Une entree - foie gras (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=cKyQx9bwiOr5X9uuw5l_3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Carpaccio of foie gras and potatoes along with some white truffle shavings.  Yep...you guessed it awesome! Les crustaces (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=lHWS6rQ1RSe_Qj2ttKb1Lw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Roasted lobster w/ cauliflower with green curry sauce.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for me but again pretty damn good.  Une soupe - la chataigne (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=RI9zI1dkjw797uAXUpP0ag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Chestnut veloute w/ smoked lardons foam and a few pieces of chestnut and foie gras at the bottom.  Simply delicious!!!  Un plat au choix - Le boeuf (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=eU_AhDxCSi_hR5P7t3pXvg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Beef ribeye cooked perfectly rare on top of some wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers.  The ribeye was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The wasabi spinach and bell peppers mated perfectly with the beef. Le bar (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=Sf5CZ0N1Mx--U1r_-alGmw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Pan fried sea bass w/ lemongrass emulstion.  Another good dish with a strong lemongrass flavor. We also had a scoop of Robuchon's mashed potatoes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=ewjlWVCBwbAtOHkXGWcuMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Very buttery and delicious.  I was struggling to finish my entree and even forgot to eat the mashed potatoes until the waiter asked if I was done.  Needless to say I didn't want them to go to waste.  Dessert - la noisette chocolatee (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=Jw5zM37YfqnYDf1ZlqxbUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Roasted hazelnut creme brulee.  What was interesting was the use of pop rock candy inside this dessert which was surprising as my mouth was popping after the first bite.  Amazing dessert.  La banane cremuse aux eclats de caramel au lait (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=kGhh1KrMLrewYEWz0_4MHg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Caramel bananas layered w/ yuzu ice cream and honeycomb candy.  Good but I preferred the hazelnut creme brulee.  Moka - (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=sIhkr7z2s-3CPSCFXXGTow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  French pressed coffee and I'd have to say the best cup of coffee I've had.  Mignardises cart (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=22fto-LQoaGgNlqBgC4M8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  Along with your dessert, they also serve you mignardises as a nice way to end the dining experience.  Supposively they have over 40 different ones to choose from!  Our mignardises for the night (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=AqNEJmu_awQ3ZMpFNBIpPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).    Parting gift - chocolates!  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=qYTTBgiq_kZ0xIi7gKZDXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).    Throughout the night we noticed the three carts that rolled through the restaurant (bread, mignardises, and the cheese cart).  One particular cheese that intrigued us was a cantaloupe looking like cheese.  Asked the waited and he was kind enough to give us a sample (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q?select=splKz5HEnGdzyOqj4khBnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XnJe...</a>).  It has a gouda texture w/ a cheddar taste.  Pretty damn good.  Awesome dining experience and was worth every penny, will be back!!!",

I know my taste buds aren't as acute as the chefs but when I really think about the dishes, I'm amazed at all the flavor nuances in the dishes. Is this place pricey? Yes. Is the menu nuts? Not really until you start tasting it. Is it worth it? Once in a long while. I would have to say price is a bit absurd only for the reason that you only get a couple dishes. I mean technically the cheapest choice is almost $200 with tip. So the bad thing is you get an an overwhelming selection of bread, an appetizer, entree, then some sweets but the overwhelming selection of sweets come out and they LIMIT you to five choices. It's a little crazy if you ask me. The food is really good but I just can't fathom the pricing and how it does not already include tip. I can pay for food, I get it but at this price I really think your wallet should only come here once in a blue moon. My main gripe is out of the four waiters/waitress who helped us, only one was honestly robotic nice and not pompous. Don't get me wrong, food is good which is why I put three stars, one for each dish I got.",

We arrived at 5:30pm and didn't get the amuse buse for over an hour. We did the 4 course meal. The foie with artichoke and the lobster appetizers were delicious. Everything else was downhill. The cheese souffle was mush. It had a decent flavor but texture was awful. After having the corn amuse buse, it just didn't pair well. My husband had the ribeye which was 2 slices of meat. For that price it should be a whole steak. I had the pork. It was too spicy with pepper. The black pepper was huge chunks that completely blew out my palate. We both ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. Mine was undercooked. Certain items on the menu if ordered were an added charge. After already paying $400 for a meal, not including tip, everything on the menu should be included. I wish I could be refunded. This was not the experience I was expecting.",

    "text": "My first 3 star Michelin restaurant.  Overall an interesting experience.  Would I repeat?  Not sure.    For starters, the ambiance is nice - done in plush tones of purple, with intimate little booths and some tables in the center.  The vibe is super bougie and all the waitstaff talk to you in hushed tones.  It's really bizarre that the restaurant is located in the MGM, though, because the MGM doesn't really seem like an appropriate spot for a 3 star Michelin restaurant.    My date and I had a dinner at 9:30 because we came after a Cirque show, so we figured it was too late for the 3 hour prix fixe menu.  We opted for the option that included an amuse bouche, an appetizer, a soup, an entree, dessert, and the dessert tray.  It was $198 per person.    The night started with offerings from the bread cart - overall, we were pretty unimpressed - none of the breads were amazing.  There was a rosemary brioche that was SUPER disappointing - I couldn't taste the rosemary at all.    The amuse bouche was honestly really weird.  It came on a BRIGHT orange tray of pumpkins that was quite frankly hideous and clashed with the classy decor of the place. It was a green apple puree thing with some avocados underneath and some fruit... maybe yuzu?  Neither my date nor I particularly cared for it.  It was served on a bed of dry ice so the presentation was kind of cool - it looked like it was smoking.  Other than the presentation though, we were mostly unimpressed.  For the appetizer, my date had the foie gras and I had the lobster.  Mine was crisp and clean and my date's foie was perfectly buttery.    We both had the kabocha pumpkin soup, and it was fantastic - it had bits of foie in it that mixed so well with the pumpkin to create a rich buttery taste.    For our entrees, my date had the duck with foie (he clearly loves foie) and I had the spaghetti with caviar and sea urchin.  It should be noted that the spaghetti had an extra charge (around $40) because it includes a lot of caviar.  I enjoyed both of our entrees.  They were both accompanied by Mr. Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes, which are supposed to be equal parts potato and butter.    For dessert, my date had the pistachio mousse and I enjoyed the restaurant's signature chocolate souffle.  The souffle was amazing and really lived up to its reputation.  The pistachio mousse was also good but it was really tiny.  The dessert tray offered a variety of chocolates.    As a parting gift, we were given a little photo booklet of the restaurant and a chocolate bar.    Overall, it was a lovely experience but my date who is a massive foodie and has been to Robuchon's restaurant in Paris was actually quite disappointed.",

The presentations were amazing.  I can see over paying for food combinations, expertise, art, etc.  But, the drinks were also way overpriced.  It was 30-40% more expensive for scotch than getting identical drink at a bar 100 yds away.  Wine list was exceptional.  Many quality half bottle selections.    It was excellent.  But, not flawless.  They forgot our cheese course after we ordered it!  Food was amazing, but overall, not worth the investment.  Amazing food, just not worth $300 a head before drinks.  I would rather eat 3 times a another premium restaurant.  Disappointed.",

Dinner was $455 for the 17 course tasting menu, water was extra (nearly $100 by the end of the night) and wine pairings for the large menu start at $295. Expect this before you come and prepare accordingly.   Normally I would have done a wine pairing, but in this case I'm glad I did not. My reservation was for 6pm and did not finish until after 11pm. It was the right amount of time.   The best piece of advice I can give. Be particular about enjoying each and every bite. You will be rewarded. Each sumptuous bite was orgasmic. Chef was on point tonight.   There is nothing bad I can say about JR, treat yourself, save up and go. There are very very few opportunities to experience cooking at this level.   Art.",

This place is very upscale, so when you walk in it is very very quiet and intimate.   The wait staff was very attentive and they had a few different people waiting on us, all with different duties. We did the five course menu which included the bread cart, amuse bouche, two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert, and the dessert cart.   The bread cart was okay. We figured it would be hot fresh bread, but it wasn't. However, we don't really know how the French eat their breads. The rest of the meal, however, was to die for. I enjoyed all of my plates and so did my boyfriend. (We ordered a lot and all different things, so I won't go into the details of each one.)

The service is exceptional! At all points during the meal I thought service was a 5. It's unbelievable the time they take, the deliberate yet perfect way they take care of tables. Additionally the food comes out looking spectacular! I had the langoustine ravioli and chicken with foie gras. So why is it 3 stars? I don't think the food is great. The ravioli dish is good, the chicken dish was average but also forgettable. The bread trolley is good as is the dessert trolley. Overall though the food doesn't leave a lasting feeling of greatness. Maybe my palate is just not developed enough to appreciate it but I do think I know good food an this is just okay. Also, it's hard to justify the price with so many other options in Vegas.",

Unfortunately they only heat up your first serving of bread.  The dish that blew me away was the king crab royale.  It was light yet so flavorful.  Definitely the best dish I had during my stay in vegas.  The service here was top notch. I had to deduct a star due to several things.  The initial waiter asked us if we would like sparkling or still water and white or rose champagne.  Me thinking that since I was going to be paying a pretty big tab here, they were going to provide complimentary \"premium water\" and glass of champagne with our meal.  I should have known better that it was vegas.  The other was the veal.  I was expecting melt in your mouth tender but recieved a slight tough cut.  The meat itself wasn't bad, just wished they would have given me a steak knife for it.  Overall a very nice experience.  I still think about the king crab dish.  Returning to vegas in 2 weeks so I may stop by or try L'atelier next door.",

    "text": "This review is definitely long overdue and things have started getting fuzzy but I definitely won't forget how disappointed I was on our experience. For the price we paid, it was definitely not worth it, even with the most economical prix fixe they have (which we ordered). They actually allow you to order just 1 prix fix menu & split it so we chose the $250 that have 2 appetizers, 2 main course & 1 dessert. To start you're given a cart of breads to choose from, which are mostly good (I remember the croissants & some cheesy bread). The amuse-bouche was pea gazpacho with some sort of jelly, which was OK. For appetizer, it was truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage (good) & foie gras (good). My main entree came in a fancy glass cover which was filled with smoke but don't recall what it was either (I think it's ok) but I definitely remember hubby's entree because it's really bad. He ordered pasta with uni & caviar which costs $45 extra. I definitely expect the pasta to be homemade but it was so bad that I ask them if it's actually homemade (which is what I would've expected) but they said it's the ready-made pasta! I was so disappointed. I almost wanted to ask for my money back at that point. Moving on to the dessert, Le Sphere which was very fancy, unique but tasted so so. The souffle which I think we ordered separately was also Ok. Once you're done with dessert, you're then offered a cart full of Mignardises. You could've just skipped the dessert menu and just go with only this since it had cheesecake, creme Brule, tiramisu, macarons, mini cupcakes, which are all delicious and you can choose as many as you want for free. Unfortunately we were pretty stuffed from what we had earlier and turned out, they don't allow \"take out box\" because supposedly Joel Robuchon believed everything has to be eaten fresh :( As a farewell gift, they gave you a bag with Joel Robuchon fancy booklet & a loaf of fruit cake, which is a little dry in my opinion. All in all, for 3* Michelin grade restaurant, I definitely expected much more, not something that I won't remember anymore only after a couple months of dining.",

It is by far the best restaurant that I have ever been to =)  I came here a few days ago with one of my best girl friends, and we had the total royal dinner treatment. We were picked up at our hotel, the Monte Carlo, by a LIMO, which took us to the MGM back entrance, directly into the secluded MGM MANSION that people usually can't get into. Being a picture whore that I am, I took pictures nonstop all the way til we got into the restaurant.   I was immediately impressed by the decor of the restaurant. I'm one of those people who's really big on the ambience of the restaurants, and I definitely give thisone 5 stars on that. The restaurant's decor gave me a very royal and luxurious feeling, almost as if I were a princess being escorted into my own personal purple dining room =) Later on, I found out that the decor is seasonal, but I'm glad I got to see the purple style =)  My friend and I got the $148 for 4 courses meal...and here' briefly how the entire meal went:  +Caviar: very delicious...one of the best I've had +Bread cart: so many different types of bread, my friend and I tried 3 each. All very delicious...especially the butter that they gave us for it. Totally melts in ur mouth! Be careful not to eat so much though...becuz there are way more food ahead! +Appetizer: salmon tartar, very delicious. in a sizzling plate too, that looked like dry ice...very cool and tasty +Soup: duck liver soup...sweet tasting, pretty, and very good +Entree: veal cheeks.....small but very soft and totally melts in ur mouth!  +Dessert: chocolate melted cake with coffee ice cream on top. HEAVENLY. It had some coffee chocolate bits on top too and the entire thing just tasted amazing. I'm a dessert fanatic so when I say this is good, it's GOOD. plus the plate that it was served in was so beautiful...omg i want it again! +Chocolate cart: god...I wish I could take the whole thing home, but they only let u try 5-6 pieces, which was one big downfall =( still, the ones that I tried (white chocolate truffles and macaroons) were amazing =) +Coffee/tea: i had a cappuccino...worked really well with the chocolates =P  In the end, they gave us a little gift bag with some homemade gummy candies in a box to take home. A sweet little something. We also asked for a tour of the kitchen, which the waitress was very happy to do for us. Saw all the awards and where the magic happens. In the end, we were escorted back out through the MGM mansion and into the limo. This time, we asked for the limo to take us to the Wynn for some chilling...and we rolled up to the wynn in Vegas fashion. Awesome night that I will never forget =)  Only two things I didn't quite like is they charge you for water. Even if you ask them for tap water, or ICE water, they don't let you. You must buy their bottled water, which is at least $10 per bottle. Second, if they can let u try as many chocolates as u want, it'd be perfect. I heard from a friend that they let u try one of each at French Laundry, so I think they can definitely improve in this area. EItherway, still the best restaurant i've been to. Definitely worth the money =)",

And make sure you like truffles because its basically on/in everything, even the ice cream. Dont get me wrong cuz I love truffles, but being so rich on the palate made me almost sick of them by the end. Could have used more balance to me. My group of 4 paid $2650 for our meal with the wine pairings and gratuities. Nevertheless, an exquisite experience. Just not one I could do all the time.",

    "text": "The initial review is below, but the newly edited view rates the Menu Decouvrete.  Magnifique!  Robuchon's tasting menu was a True delight.  We took up the waiter's offer for him to pick wine pairings for us, and instead of a specific flight, with one per course (which would have killed me) he did a \"half a glass\" with every other course.  The half glasses were very generous, and I was rather tipsy on excellent wine, along with a great meal.  We were actually also given matching desert wines on the house.  That being said, it still almost came out to $500 with a generous tip, but it was well worth it.  L'AMUSE-BOUCHE Cucumber gele tarragon cream, cumin yogurt  It included all of the flavors of Indian food, without the heaviness or heat.  A perfect way to start a discovery menu.  LE THON ROUGE Bluefin tuna with tomato infused olive oil  Perfect thickness of tuna, and seasoned exceptionally well. This is coming from a sushi afficianado.  LA SAINT-JACQUES Fresh scallops cooked in the shell with seaweed infused butter  The seaweed butter really added an amazing depth to this dish.  L'OEUF Egg cocotte topped with a light mushroom cream  Wow.  It was rich, flavorful, and decadent.  LA CHATAIGNE Light chestnut velout with caramelized foie gras and crispy bacon  The richest of the dishes, they did not skimp on the foie, and the chestnut's sweetness complemented the richness of the foie perfectly.  LE SAUMON Slightly smoked salmon served warm confit potatoes  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the portion was more than generous, after having so many dishes.  LA CAILLE Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled-mashed potatoes  This is so good, it makes me tear up just thinking about it.  Rich, sweet, smooth, amazing textures and flavors combined without being overwhelming.  LA MANDARINE Sheep's milk yogurt panna cotta, mandarin confit, bergamot tea infusion  I loved the bergamot tea infusion.  The balance of flavors was excellent.  LA POIRE Pear sorbet, meringue glace, chocolate-caramelized cinnamon cream  I think pear is highly underused in the states.  This was excellent, and the pear sorbet encased in the meringue was genius.  LE CAFE Coffee or Espresso  __ The old review__  Okay...so why don't more people in the US know who Joel Robuchon is?  What's wrong with you people?  The national treasure in France?  Ring a bell!  Good Lord, please eat here if you can afford it!  The Le Caille was the finest dish I've ever consumed in my life.  Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled-mashed potatoes... and the thing I remember the most was the potatoes. This is not to discount anything about the quail, which was amazing, but the potatoes are like starch silk.  Just amazing stuff.  I highly reccomend the chartreusse dessert.  Lighter than air, just sweet, lovely, and amazing.  The kitchen is immaculate, and you can watch as they cook and prep in front of you.  Amazing service, and knowledgeable service, which isn't always easy to find in Vegas.  Shine on you crazy 5 diamonds.",

    "text": "This was The Ultimate Experience! Totally worth the splurge. I made the reservation as soon as I found out I was going to Vegas. The week of my reservation, I called and made reservations for the gold limo. This was complimentary to and from the dinner! It was right on time and picked my best friend and I up in front of our hotel. It drove into the back of the MGM Grand into the Mansions Courtyard. This is slightly behind the strip and the large water fountain drowned out the noise of the strip. The driver was very gracious and helped take pictures for us from multiple frames. We were ushered into the secluded Mansions and it was beautiful. It was quiet and very tastefully decorated. Not over the top like most of the hotels. We were met by 2 hostesses who walked us through the Mansions and the corridors, past the private tables and into the casino. They were very polite and answered all our inquisitive questions about the Mansins and the high rollers that come through there. The restaurant is very artfully decorated. It was quiet inside and very comfortable setting. Not at all intimidating. After we were seated, a server immediately came and offered drinks. We each had a glass of champagne. My bf and I are not big drinkers so we were fine with a glass each.thank goodness! The champagne was $45 a glass! A little pricey! We each chose the 6 course tasting. This was way too much food. We should have chosen the 4 instead. We were dying by the end of the 4th course. The food was so rich. The amuse bouche was delicious. The bread cart was what I had been waiting a few weeks for. It did not dissapoint! The hand-crafted butter from France and the olive oil were so good! I ate way too much bread and butter and olive oil. All the dishes were wonderful but the folie gras dishes were the best I've ever tasted. Definitely get all the folie gras on the menu! But keep in mind when you are considering how many courses to taste that the food is very rich. By the time we had our 2nd entree, we were so full that we couldn't appreciate the velvety rich creamy mashed potatoes. The cheeses were great too but I was too full to really appreciate them. I didn't think I was going to have room for my dessert but it was so delicious that I managed to wolf it all down. The candy cart I could've taken it all home!  It was definitely worth the splurge. From the individually hand painted plates (done by the chefs who made each dish) to the to-die for food, it was an experience I will not soon forget.  The take home chocolate bar is so good that I want more soon!",

It is so hard to decide which to sample and still leave room for the main meal!  Expensive? Yes - but well worth the experience.

They have a policy that you take nothing home, not chocolates, nothing, as the chef \"cannot control the experience after anything leaves\".  Fine, I can get on board with that, except for the log of chateubriand they serve tableside.  I've reconciled with my own conscious eating meat, and foie gras, but please stop over preparing both, only to intentionally throw it away as waste minutes later.  It's disrespectful to the animal, and adds cost to the diner (helping make this an insanely expensive experience).",

    "text": "As far as dining experiences go, this was the ultimate! There is a reason it takes months to get a reservation. There are only a handful of tables inside a room that seems like you are in the finest Parisian restaurant. The tables are spaced so you can enjoy the company.  You will not have better service anywhere.  Period. Each table has a wait staff that treats you like you are royalty. They start with a bread cart that contains a dozen or more of the freshest, tastiest baked breads you can imagine served with the sweetest creamiest butter. I would love to go there one night and just eat different breads all night long. They were fantastic. We both had the tasting menu for dinner. What this means is that for the next two hours, they served us non-stop. I think it was 17 or 18 different plates--each. Some were better than others. But each one was unique and all of them were one-of-a-kind. No other restaurant is serving any of these dishes prepared this way. The presentation of each dish was stunning. This was truly art.  This was an amazing dining experience. It is expensive. Our food cost alone was over $900.  But it was incredible.  The only issue I have is the amount of food. For my wife, it was perfect. Yet, even with all those courses, it was not a lot of food. I would suggest they serve their current portions to women, and a double portion to men. Then everyone one be satisfied.",

    "text": "This was the most outrageous and amazing dining experience I've ever had. The level of service and food is above practically everything else there is.  A limo comes to pick you up where ever you're staying and takes you too a back entrance of the MGM grand. Someone meets you there and walks you through an amazing courtyard and eventually to the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is surprisingly small, but you can understand why. The dining room is truly amazing, I won't even go into it because I couldn't do the decorations justice, but trust me; it's one of a kind.  The meal began with impeccable service and a giant tray of dozens of different kinds of bread for you to choose. This may have been my favorite part of the meal. You can choose as many as you want; the most notable for me was the bacon-mustard bread, but they were all great.  The first course I had was a soup with foie-gras and bacon in it. It was absolutely delicious and gone way too soon.  Next came the King-crab salad which was also great, with huge lumps of crab meat and alongside a complicated small salad assembly.  My main course was the duck, which was unbelievably good with perfect texture and taste.   However; the best entree you can get is the veal cheeks. I had two bites and they were some of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. Chef Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes were the creamiest I've ever had, and some of the best.  Dessert's a whole different story: You better be prepared to be overwhelmed. Apart from the massive chocolate tray that comes out, you will also experience one of the best desserts you've ever had.   And let's get one thing straight: I'm not the kind of person to suck up to a restaurant like this; at these prices it better damn well deliver. And I can assure you it does.   If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.",

Lucky for us, the wonderful MGM concierge were able to book us a (albeit very late!) reservation.  When I first walked in, I couldn't decide whether or not I hated or loved the decor.  Yes, it was \"fancy\"...but I couldn't help but think that I was inside a Christmas present!  Everything was sparkly and our table had these little gold balls strewn about, with a very glittery/sparkly table runner and these glittery twigs of some sort as the centerpiece.  I was a bit distracted at best until our waiter came and his French accent made me forget about the decor - at least for a moment or so.  I loved that the menu given to me didn't have prices, but the one given to my husband did!  I also love the bread cart that they bring out before dinner.  The milk bread was deelish, but I can do without the bacon twist (?)  As far as dinner went -- we had the 6 course tasting menu and every little dish served to us was fantastic!  My fave?  The chorizo soup...omg, that was to die for!  But everything was so good, it was fairly difficult to pick just one!    I would love to come here again, but it's definitely a once in a lifetime deal...unless, of course, you've got some major cash to spare!",

    "text": "One word for Joel Robuchon is spectacular.  It was my last night at Vegas, so my friends and I spurgled ourselves with the best fine dining experience at Joel Robuchon.  No why wonder it is 3 star Michelin rated.  It's the most elegant restaurant I had went to.  Everything from the color choice, chandelier, and seating was perfect.  My wife And I each order the two course meal.  At first I thought it wouldn't feel me up, but i was so wrong.  There was a promotion at MGM grand, if you are a prima club  member which I was, you would get a free bottle of champagne.  We started with l'amuse-bouche which was cavier with crab meat.  I can't believed a restaurant would serve cavier as l'amuse bouche because it would past as an appetizer.  It was so refreshing.  It's was just exceptional and they didn't go skimpy on the crab meat or the caviar.  For the main course, I had their signature dish which was the spiny lobster poached in a court bouillon with coral, radish shaving and nori.  I absolutely love this dish.  The best lobster dish I had ever eaten in my life.  The bouillon was super tasty and light.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and juicy.  My wife had the beef ribeye with wasabi spinach.  It was also very good, but it can't beat my spiny lobster.  For dessert, I chose the mojito and my wife had the chocolate.  The mojito was refreshing, but I prefer the chocolate because of the house made decaf mocha ice cream.  We also had a pistachio and strawberry ice cream cake on the house since we were celebrating a friends birthday one month early.  Before we left, we got complimentary coffee and mixture of minature desserts.  I ate all the desserts and drank all the coffee.  It was good and for the ladies they were given a pretty gift box filled with raspberry and passion fruit marshmallow.  Joel robuchon is once in a life time experience. It was a very expensive meal that is worth every dollar, but I would just do it once.",

The food is undeniably terrific, impeccably presented, and yes if you're a foodsnob, you could *always* have better.  But better food in other places may not offer you front row seating to the entire kitchen facility and staff preparing the plates as L'Atelier does.  Witnessing the heirarchy of chefs meticulously preparing every plate like a masterpiece painting (near perfection apparently their only standard) is a spectacle in itself.  Small plates to share, or degustation (tasting menus) are the way to go here.  I had the 9-course tasting menu and my partner had the 4-course version of it.  Only one dish actually coincided in both menus:  an egg cocotte (mousse like consistency), with fried chantarelles and mushroom foam.  Variety between two menus made for perfect share-sampling the whole evening.  Despite challenges of synchronizing a 9-course and 4-course menu, the kitchen managed the preparation and presentation timing remarkably well.  Only one flub:  they nearly missed on of my courses, and quickly remedied the situation.  The 9 course menu I had consisted of  * Vegetable fondant topped with a delicate avocado cream.  * Langoustine carpaccio with roasted poppy seed dressing.  * Poached baby kumamoto oysters with French \"Echire\" salted butter.  * Asparagus with chilled Dungeness salad (other details I forget)  * Warm chicken broth with foie gras raviolis and herbs  * Egg cocotte topped with a light mushroom cream.  * Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras, and served with a truffled potato pure (the alternate choice would have been a skirt steak), but to me this and the egg course were the winning highlights (as was my partner's fresh cod main course served in an superb vegetable broth -- far more exciting to the palate than it reads)  * 2 dessert courses led out by a very velvety strawberry \"milkshake\", then an assortment of fruits and tarts.  If you partake in the full degustation, expect to spend 2 to 2.5 hours at the restaurant.  Make it your evening's main event and relish it.  And chrissakes, don't waste it by getting shitfaced afterwards.  Book between 7:30 and 8PM so you witness the staff kick it into high gear when the peak crowd rolls in.  I left wine selections up to the sommelier, who paired up a pinot grigio, then a French pinot noir with my meal -- wonderful.  Judging by what we witnessed most frequently prepared in the kitchen, their steak tartar appears to be very popular as well.",

    "text": "The restaurant and decor is absolutely  gorgeous! We used the complimentary limo service which came to our hotel to pick us up and take us to the MGM. This was nice. Now for the food. I've dined at many Michelin Star restaurants all over the world. I understand this restaurant received 3 stars back in 2009 but it hasn't been rated since Vegas is no longer part of that Michelin rated guide. So since I didn't dine here in 2009, perhaps it was better back then. The food was above average but not exceptional. Like I said, maybe the quality has gotten worse. The stand out entree was the spaghetti with uni and caviar. But really, if you put caviar and uni on anything it will taste delicious. Not that innovating. So wasn't super blown away here. They had a nice bread cart with a very good variety of bread and a special butter that was imported which was pretty good. I consider the bread cart an entree and was a nice  since it's pushed around on a cart and you have soo many to choose from. They also have a huge dessert cart at the end of dinner. This was really nice. Service was ok. The servers were a bit stiff and robotic besides the guy who was pushing around the bread and dessert cart and refilling our water. Overall, this restaurant excels on presentation. But the food, for the price and service. Not worth it. My favorite entree is usually dessert so I was very excited to eat . I ordered this pear with a chocolate dome dessert and it was DISGUSTING!! I was soo disappointed I wanted to send it back to the kitchen but I held it in. Luckily, they had dessert cart otherwise I would have been extremely upset. have I would suggest going to French Laundry instead. Thomas Keller's dishes are way more fresh and innovative than this place. The entrees/desserts at French Laundry were AHH-MAZZING and more unique. don't waste you money going here. There are far better places.",

    "text": "Only one other restaurant I have dined in the last 15 years can compare to Joel Robuchon: Noma in Copenhagen. Two other friends and I decided to go all in and get the 11 course Chef Tasting, and the Grand Cru Wine pairing.  We also had a table \"outside\" which proved to be the best seats (IMO) in the restaurant. One wine in particular stood out: 1982 Pavilion Blanc Du Chateau Margaux - Grand Vin Blanc Sec de Bordeaux. We had separate bread, and desert service that, by them self, were amazing. The two Sommelier's that were servicing our table were great and explained everything to perfection. This experience is something special and would definitely recommend for a honey moon, very special celebration (e.g., you'll need the salary or bonus increase!), etc. Eat slow, enjoy the wine pairings and take in the experience...you will undoubtedly come to the same conclusion I did... They deserve all 3 Michelin Stars (and compliments to all of the staff)  My only complaint was that we were not greeted by anyone when we came in, we waited by the door for almost 10 minutes before we seated ourself at the bar. Staff continuously looked us in the face and walked by. I actually was about to leave (20 minute mark) until my friend got up, found a staff member in the dining area and told him we had a reservation for 9pm for three (Saturday, August 10). After being seated the staff were extremely courteous and actually moved us to another table we wanted outside. Someone needs to retrain the hostess and staff on this. When I went to Noma's, the door was opened for us and greeted us by name. I would not have mentioned this silly event except that if you are a 3 Star Michelin restaurant, it is the attention to detail of the \"little\" things that separates you from the pack....",

    "text": "The experience was amazing. From the seating room prior to being sat at our table, to the bread cart (including expansive styles, and flavors) when you first sit. They do offer a 16 course tasting menu, but we honestly figured we would be fine with a lessor option. We really enjoyed the extreme care with which they prepare the food, and the knowledge of the staff. The Caviar is a great touch by the way! The dining was seamless down to the clearing of your plates (seemingly unnoticed throughout the whole restaurant as if they almost just disappear).   Quite impressive and an amazing wine list but more impressed with the pastry chef! The pastry cart is mouth watering. But when you think you're done they send you with a gift bag for the ladies, which has a great loaf of a pistachio/berry infused bread.   You will spend money here, but if you are a foodie it is an experience like few others.",

Their service is very professional and servers are all very nice and friendly. They have a great collection of the bread and sweets. Other than the tasty menu. They also have 4 different menu to choose. We choose their $250( per person) menu. Everyone can choose 2 appetizers, 2 main course, 1 dessert. We end up very full, and I cannot finish my food actually. But all the food are very tasty. I like their chicken the best. Also their mash potatoes are very unique and delicious. I have a wonderful and unforgettable night here. I highly recommend this place if you want to celebrate your special day!",

    "text": "I've been fortunate to have a good amount of fine dining experiences, but knowing there was a 3-Michelin star restaurant in our very hotel made it critical that we visit. We made reservations a few weeks in advance, though ultimately, our 8:30pm reservation ended up with our being the last people to leave the restaurant. Being at the tail end of service was sort of interesting, but it also meant everyone around us was already putting stuff away and tidying up the restaurant.   My husband and I went for the 2nd cheapest option (and quantity of food), and we were definitely full by the end. As for food taste and presentation, JR definitely gets 5 stars. Every dish was very beautiful, and the flavors were unique and rich. We got the light green pea veloute with peppermint and bacon - seemingly so simple but divine - and the truffled langoustine ravioli. These hot appetizers were very delicious and the most memorable for me. The desserts were also very creative and unique.  I did find the servers here super professional but a little bit too impersonal. I made a joke about the little stool for one's purse, and apparently it wasn't very funny. Not a big deal, but it made the experience a little bit more \"stuffier\" than I usually like.   In the end, the food was definitely some of the tastiest I've ever had, but the meal experience overall was not as high in my memory.",

    "text": "If art on a plate is what you appreciate then Joel Robuchon will not disappoint you, but I was looking for a bit more considering the reputation and the price.  We both went all in since we were celebrating a special birthday for Lissa G. The full 18 course menu with wine tasting. Im not going to go dish by dish, but you should know that the presentation on each and every dish, especially the desserts, is the best I have ever seen! Perhaps I had built up my expectations too high, but the taste of most of the dishes was good, but nothing wowed me, especially for the price tag of about $900 each!  Service is where they really fell short.  While our waiter was on top of everything, the sommelier often poured our wine to taste with the food well after our dishes arrived.  Super high end places like this serve the food at a temperature to immediately eat and I hate cold food so this was a big miss on there part.  We finally complained after I had finished my main entree and no wine had arrived until I was done with he plate. The head waiter did make an adjustment to the bill of about $100 but the annoyance clouded our view throughout the night.  I can see why people love this place, but with so many different options now a days I will spend my money elsewhere. Regardless, it is checked off the list and all and all  we had a good night. Next time we will get on a plane to NY and go back to 11 Madison Park for about the same price!",

    "text": "I could recommend the restaurant based on the expansive French cheese cart alone. But wait, there's more.  The restaurant has a smaller table footprint and books those tables well in advance. Given that the restaurant has 3 Michelin stars, it's no wonder that it's so popular. Make your reservations early!   We arrived early for our reservation and were directed to a mini lounge area with plush seating and a bar area. We opted to wait for our table before ordering drinks but I could imagine enjoying the lounge area on its own too. Upon being seated we were provided menus and an explanation of the options. There are 5 menus from which to choose. The largest is their tasting menu with around 17 courses for $445 per person (plus taxes and tip). The other options include 1. $250 for an amuse bouche, two appetizers, two main courses, dessert, and ending sweets, 2. $198 for an amuse bouche, two appetizers, one main course, dessert, and ending sweets, 3. $169 for an amuse bouche, one appetizer, one main course, and ending sweets, and 4. $127 for an amuse bouche, one main course, dessert, and ending sweets. This allows for flexibility in selection as well as price to accommodate different people. However, the 17-course menu is only allowed if the entire table chooses it.   For our visit, my guest and I both chose the third option. We actually received two amuse bouche tastes and enjoyed them both. Before the meal began, the famous bread cart was rolled over to us and we were allowed to select as many options as we wanted. They heated our selections before serving, which was a nice touch. I have to be honest that I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't an option of a warm fluffy bread roll. I could eat an entire meal of the bread rolls from Craftsteak and was hoping for something similar here. That being said, there are a lot of bread options here and they are good. For food selections, we chose the lobster and turnip appetizer, the ribeye, the sea bass, and the magnificent cheese plate. Each of these courses was spectacular. For the cheese plate, they rolled over a huge cart with a variety of soft, semi-soft, and hard cheeses from which to choose. You aren't limited to a certain number so your only limit is your stomach. For ooey gooey French cheesy heaven, I apparently grew a second stomach and managed to consume six selections. And I don't regret one bite! Somehow after all of this, I wasn't able to say no to the ending sweets cart. There had to be at least 20 tiny sweets options and again we were allowed to select as many as our hearts (and stomachs) desired. We tried a marshmallow chocolate pop, a mini ginger creme brulee, and a sugared gummy treat. To go along with our meals, we both selected red wines. I must warn of the sticker shock of the by-the-glass wine options. Expect to pay $30 to $60 per glass of wine. The wine is quite delicious though so you may feel somewhat okay with the splurge.   Service was amazing as to be expected with a restaurant of this caliber. The decor and artistic presentation of the dishes were also beautiful. At the end of our meal, we were sent home with a lemon pineapple bread loaf (presumably to eat for breakfast due to our fully stomachs). Needless to say, the entire dining experience was spectacular and I can highly recommend a visit.",

The 3 stars  Michelin Guide, 5-stars Forbes Travel Guide, and top 5 best restaurants in the United States by Gourmet magazine is truly worth the high praise and price. The restaurant is located at the MGM hotel and next door to the MGM theater. A once in a lifetime experience to be had in the city of endless possibilities. The music and ambiance made for a perfect storm of food coma capital.   Pros  Interior and Seating: Decadent, beautiful, and upscale. Everything you would expect from a world class fine dining restaurant. As you enter those magical double doors, you are instantly transported away from the busyness of the casino and wisp into another world of fine dining. The decor is classical, yet there are furnishing of modern touches. It is a mixture of styles between the Bellagio's and Cosmopolitan mixed together in a french style.   Service: Professional, friendly, and available at your fingertips. The service is impeccable, from the hostess to the servers and waiters. Even something as small as setting up the tables was done in an elegant manner. Everyone here is on top of their professional game and knowledgeable to tell you what exactly you're consuming. The waiters also ask if you have an itinerary, so they can plan your meal according to your scedule. I recommend blocking a few hours to fully enjoy the meal. The restaurant use to have a limo service where you could get picked up anywhere on the strip and be chauffeured, which was part of your meal. Unfortunately they do not have it anymore and unless you're a guest at the MGM then Uber and Taxis is your best mode of transportation.  Food: Words really cannot describe the magical taste the chefs crafted together. There were so many moments where I was taken back and closed my eyes in pleasure after taking the first bite of each new dish. Even the starter breads was simply fresh and tasty; the mini baguette was my personal favorite for its crust and moist interior. The La Langoustine with foie gras sauce from the hot appetizer section was the BEST item from the menu and one of the best bites I've had in a lifetime. Langoustine is a smaller lobster and their version of a lobster ravioli really set the bar for my taste in lobsters, thank you Joel Robuchon for taking lobster to a whole new level.   There was really nothing negative to say about the dining experience. The price could be a negative, but well worth it for the heavenly food, professional and kind service, and elegant ambiance and I do recommend going for the tasting menu or the express menu if you have a smaller appetite.",

Definitely more becomes less in this case. Too many small dishes in each course and nothing really seemed to complement each other in any meaningful way. And like the old saying, what happens in vegas, stays in vegas. It definitely rings True for my experience at this restaurant. I wouldnt want to experience it anywhere else. Haha.",

For me, I go for the food, so the quicker the turnover between each course, the better. I like a bunch of courses, but not if it takes 3 hrs to dine. If it were run a bit more like Alinea, that's the only room for improvement. Still definitely 5 stars.",

    "text": "Sad to hear today that Chef passed away.  Far too young to be taken from us, he will be sorely missed by his family, friends and the entire food community.  it was his passing that brought me here and then I realized I hadn't left a review.  The Mrs. and I visited a while ago for a special anniversary. We've only been once so far, and the experience was unforgettable.  Keep in mind, we are not big ballers, just two average people who happen to like far better than average dining experiences.  The experience starts off in high luxury when we are picked up in a limo at our hotel.  Ahh how the other half live.. must be nice..  At any rate, you are shuttled in style and comfort into The Mansion, which is the high-roller part of the MGM.  You never have to see the lobby or the common riff-raff (which any other night, the Mrs. and I would be among), to get to your table.    As others have put into their reviews, the dining room is of course elegant, opulent, yet tasteful.  The staff couldn't be more friendly, yet at the same time dignified.  You never get the sense that it's a stuffy place for stuffy people.  Yes, everyone is dressed to the nines but it still has a relaxing, comfortable vibe.  As for the food, there's no way I can type out a course by course description of the 16 course menu we had (I'm reading now it's 17), but suffice it to say that the food is of the highest quality ingredients and assembled by highly trained and skilled masters in the kitchen.   And the dishes keep coming so you should prepare like Joey Chestnut ahead of the Nathans competition because you will feel like Mr. Creosote at the end, especially if you are weak like us and enjoy a lot of bread, because the bread cart is magnificent, and if you try one of every type (like I did) you will not be able to accept the whhhaffer theen mint at the end.  Oh yeah, the butter too.. do die for..  For us, this was a once maybe in a lifetime type of experience, who knows, maybe on our 50th anniversary we will go back.  I recommend everyone who is into high end dining to try it once.  And if you have the means, this would be a great place to be a \"regular\"  Adieu, Monsieur Robuchon..",

We did the big 17 course tasting menu, which we felt for the price, was really light on protein, specifically meat. On my one red meat course and maybe 3 or 4 seafood.   2. This may not matter to some but I really felt like the dress of the majority of patrons really cheapens the atmosphere. How hard is it to dress nicely? If I am spending this much on a meal it would be nice to have an enforced dress code at the restaurant. Keep it classy!  Other than those two things it was a wonderful experience, but not sure we will repeat it for a 3rd time.",

    "text": "The quintessential 5 Star French Dinning experience! There are tasting menus and Michelin starred restaurants that I'd clearly give the nod to over Joel Robuchon, but Robuchon remains the measure to which so many others are compared to.  You are hard-pressed to find a more opulent setting for dinner in Vegas. The plush dinning room offers an extravagant mansion feel in place of a stylish dinning room more typical of this price-point. The food is not just indicative of Post Nouvelle French Cuisine standards (which translates better than new nouvelle French if you're keeping score at home) as it is actually is THE standard of Post Nouvelle French Cuisine for so many.  I brought my love here to celebrate her birthday, and we were not disappointed. There is something fabulously special and truly beautiful about a Robuchon evening.  Should you go here? I have not been in any hurry to write this review...mostly because of the expense associated with a like Robuchon. If an evening here is not considered expensive and you drop $800 - $1,200 regularly on dinner for two, then absolutely!...come here...then again, you're probably not reading my review. If you dine in this price range from time-to-time, Robuchon is in my top 5 in Vegas, and as I already stated earlier is eventually a must, but not my first choice in Vegas. Then the difficult decisions arise. I have plenty of friends that eat at this price-point once a year...or even once every few years. Several of them have asked about eating here for a rare splurge at this price-point, and while there are many reasons why Robuchon should be that choice, there are also several reasons why I would direct you to another destination based mostly on expectations...which actually becomes less about Robuchon and more about you.",

It's been a few years, and these days I don't go for the full grand course menu (~$500, 16+ courses, ~3hrs) as much anymore unless if we're dining with friends and they want the full experience. I'm happy just ordering the smaller set menus where you pick an appetizer and entree and dessert - that's enough food for me! I also no longer ask for everything on the dessert cart or everything on the bread cart - although there are many times where I want to, I have to remind myself the calories and sugar aren't necessities! But if it's your first time here, DEFINITELY ask for one of each item on the bread cart and one of each item on the dessert cart just to try everything! No shame.   My favorite part of the restaurant is the quiet ambiance where I really feel like my husband and I are getting away from the rest of the world, away from our phones (other than some photos) and we can focus on each other. There aren't many restaurants that make me feel like that - in a room with other guests, you feel like your table is the only one there.",

Walking in already I could sense the refinement and professionalism. Attention to detail was everywhere.  After being seated and ordered a half bottle of blanc di blanc champagne, we were server this small complimentary appetizer which was a sample of heavenly flavor.   We chose the 4-course meal (2 appetizers, main dish and dessert) each and the sommelier helped us pair a wine with the meal. Nicely done!  Between us we had a tomato dish, ravioli langoustine with foil gras, Scottish salmon with caviar and Iberian ham with asparagus. Small bites as the taste took over our senses.     The main dish was steak that was so flavor and paired very well with the Bordeaux red, and also the caramelized black cod in a pepper sauce and this paired with the burgundy( Gevery-Chambertin, dom. De la Vougeraie).  Before all of the food came we had a bread \"sommelier \". The selection was extensive . This with the butter and wine was a meal in itself.  After our dessert our bread Somm. Was now a dessert sommelier with a cart full of exquisite choices.  We were full. Full of the best tastes coveting a wide range of flavors. Our main server, our assistant whom we had more interaction with, the sommelier and all the supporting staff were wonderful, professional individuals.   This is an epicurean wonderland; the French are dancing on your palate",

This was the best service we have ever had in the US. Food meticulously crafted and delicious! Classic French wonderful-ness. One of my favorite things about the menu is that you can go for just an appetizer and entree or a full sixteen course meal, and everything in between. Plus your table doesn't need to order the same menu. So I can an order an extra two courses compared to my husband (I like to eat!!).  What to wear: Formal. Elegant. Suits but not necessarily ties. Dresses. Formal looking maxi dresses and cocktail dresses are acceptable. Bring a shawl incase you get cold, it can be a long meal.",

    "text": "I ate at Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier restaurant in Paris around 5 years ago, and it was the most memorable meal of my life.  So, I obviously had very high expectations for his Las Vegas sit-down (more formal) restaurant.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's much more formal than L'Atelier, and the service is top-notch.  This is a typical French restaurant - they won't suggest food items outright, but will try to gather information on your tastes and then suggest items to match.  The service really fit the decor - formal, professional, but warm enough to make us feel comfortable.  The meal was outstanding! I ordered the Menu A $198, and it was a LOT of food.  My appetizers included L'Oursin (sea urchain plate that was very tasty) and the Foie gras (wow - one of the best I've ever had).  My main was Le Homard - lobster roasted with chestnuts and asparagus - truly outstanding.  My friends had a variety of other dishes including the beef, all of which were amazing.  Finally for desert I had the Black Forest - not at all the typical Black Forest cake.  It was a compilation of cherry sauce, chocolate griottine, in a glass ball for a plate. You had to dive your spoon all the way through to get the perfect mix of flavours - it was amazing!  I also tried the Souffle and Sphere - also amazing!  Finally, they sent over the sweet table, and we tried more sweets.  Needless to say, we were a little full by the end.  This is not a cheap restaurant by any means.  However if you're looking to impress your date, or just have an unbelievable experience of haute cuisine and fancy service, try this one!",

Dine in date: July 30, 2014  We chose Menu A $250 (l'amuse bouche, 2 apps, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, a seductive sweet cart), the cheese trolley was extra so I'm not sure why they have it on the above link.  Also, sometimes they change their menu around (I think).  L'amuse-bouche: something with kale it was just average  COLD APPS: L'oursin - sea urchin in orange vinaigrette, delicate gelee of green asparagus with turmeric. Le Crabe Royale - Alaskan King crab, salad of avocado & tomato in a heart of romaine & olive oil.  I got the sea urchin, my partner got the king crab; I don't recommend the sea urchin.  I don't like to the fact that it seems like you can taste the fishiness.  If you like Chinese bamboo shoots that smells like cow fertilizer or urine, then try it...but I don't like it.    HOT APPS: Le Foie Gras de Canard - Grilled foie gras, bell pepper confit in acacia honey. L'oeuf de Poule - Deep-fried boiled eggs in light Comte cheese sauce with iberico de bellota ham.   Foie gras was cook to perfection, this was awesomely delicious...my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review reminiscing the taste of the perfect foie gras in my mouth.  I can't remember if I like the deep-fried boiled eggs.  MAIN COURSES:  La Langouste - Spiny lobster roasted in a shellfish jus with spinach leaves and lemongrass emulsion. Le Bar - Pan seared sea bass in salted butter with baby artichoke sauce.  Both tasted delicious.  My partner LOOOOVEd his sea bass more than my lobster.  Le Boeuf - Beef cheeks braised with eggplant in red miso & ginger sauce, medley of bell peppers Le Poulet Fermier - Caramelized farm chicken with foie gras, farro risotto with snow peas.  Beef cheeks were tender, my partner didn't care for his chicken dish because he was expecting the foie gras he tasted from mine.   DESSERTS:  Les Herbes - Green chartreuse sabayon topped with herb sorbet & a hazelnut praline L'Abricot - Sugar pearl filled with apricots & panna cotta, cubes of seasonal fruit gelee with verbena.  Les Herbes was the winner on this one.  The L'Abricot was too citrusy for me.   Mignardises - seductive sweets trolley  I asked for 1 of each but they told me only 5/ person can choose 1, so we had 10 different things.  Surprisingly, I didn't like the macaroons.  Creme Brulee was OK...I didn't care for a lot of the sweets they offered on their trolley.  OVERALL, if you have the money, won a lot of money, love french food, just want to try fine dining or in vegas; then you should try it, after all it's the only 3 Michelin star restaurant in Vegas.   I like how they give the diners the freedom to choose whatever you like instead of 1 table getting the same kind of menu or chefs tasting.  So yes, if you prefer getting a main course while the other party at your table is getting 11 courses so you can pick on theirs then you're allowed; different than Melisse & Providence.  I'm giving this a 4 star because I was famish upon our arrival and was experiencing hunger pains.   The service of just giving us a menu took too long.  They also messed up on our bill & charged us an extra $169, but they corrected that error.  Everyone will have different experiences.  I'd definitely would like to come back and just order the foie gras & maybe try other things depending how much I win at the table.",

There are 5 or 6 different tasting menus ranging in price from $127 to $455 (I could be off by a few dollars here). My Boo and I chose different things so that we could maximize our taste of this pricey meal. To start, the chef sent out these quinoa amuse-bouches which were not spectacular. They were at least light but there was very little flavor except a dry oatmeal-y type flavor. Not a good beginning but the meal did pick up. Next I had the violet artichoke something something which was very tasty although running up against even my taste for tart. My Boo had something with morel mushrooms which was good though not as memorable as one would hope. The next dish was a white asparagus with black garlic sauce. This was definitely a clunker...very bland and memorable only for being unworthy of such a meal. My Boo chose more wisely by getting a fried egg dish on crispy rice. The egg was perfectly cooked and the rice was divine. For our main course, I chose the lobster with mint and pea broth while my Boo chose the John Dory over squid ink risotto. I did not get any mint flavor in the broth but the pea came through. The lobster was, of course, perfectly cooked but not special in any way. My Boo's choice, though, had a squid ink risotto which was one of the best I have ever had.   The dessert deserves its own paragraph because it was exquisite. I chose the sugar boule with blueberry yogurt sorbet and my Boo chose a take on Black Forest cake. The presentation of these and the flavors were absolutely next level. For this alone, most of the price was justified because the skill to make these beautiful creations is beyond expert. The desserts were light and perfectly sweet. I hate cloyingly sweet desserts and these were just right.  This place takes all cards. It is in the MGM Grand so parking is obviously no problem in their structure.",

The desserts were absolutely amazing and the presentation was great!   Service- The service was good and they were attentive.   Ambiance- The restaurant is very nicely decorated and ambiance is good. It's a very quiet place and do not recommend for families. It's a good spot for a date if you're looking to spend $$$$!   Overall it was just ok. It's definitely an experience but the food isn't blow your hair back besides the dessert.",

Most hot appetisers were vegetarian and only one had fish, need to work on these options. The only good option was langoustine ravioli which was 35$ supplement per person. It was nice, but annoyed to pay supplement.   Pork main was very underwhelming too, looked great, but lacked taste and wow factor.   Duck was great and had the wow factor.  Chocolate souffle was best I've ever had.  Sweet trolley was incredible, especially the lemon meringue.",

    "text": "Six months ago, my husband surprised me with reservations at Joel Robuchon. I was shocked and the experience was unforgettable. I felt like Cinderella. I never imagined we'd return so soon, but he planned another dinner for us, this time, another couple joined us. I slipped on my glass slippers and eagerly awaited the night to unfold. Anticipation was high leading up to our 6:30 dinner reservation. It felt like Christmas. Santa didn't appear, but his elves were whipping up special treats in the kitchen. There was no question, we returned for the 15-course degustation menu ($435), complete with bread and mignardises carts. Our friend also chose the $295 wine pairing. It is the bottom tier, but the wines were outstanding and perfectly paired. The husband and I opted for two half bottles, Chardonnay and a very special Red from France.  The bread cart immediately seduced us and we quickly tumbled down the rabbit hole. The four of us were giddy as can be, we were blown away again and again by the refinement of the experience.  It is glorious. It is euphoric. It is even obscene. However, this is no ordinary meal. It is art. Delectable, delicious art.  Cream of kale cabbage over delicate vegetable gelee. Kale has never tasted so good. The textures of this dish are extraordinary. It was a wonderful way to excite the palate.  Violet artichoke and foie gras salad with parmesan shavings. This was a fine dish, but not one to cause me to swoon.  Symphony of osetra caviar with salmon tartare, chilled sweet corn soup, and king crab on crustacean gelee. This was served as one breathtaking presentation, however, it counted as three-courses. The caviar and sweet corn will forever fill my dreams. It was sweet and salty and utterly perfect. I was blown away. I consumed more caviar with these dishes than I had in my existence prior to this meal.  Semi-soft boiled egg florentine with Comte cheese sauce. This was loved by everyone in the group, but me. It's funny, too, because the soft boiled egg was a favorite during our last dinner. That version seemed to have enough to offset the richness of the egg. This one felt like I had consumed a dozen farm fresh eggs.   Seared scallop with lemongrass, broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked as risotto. This dish was well executed. Apparently, I've been eating overcooked scallops my whole life. These were scrumptiously medium rare.  Thin veloute of porcini mushrooms with jasmine rice cream, crispy matsutake and foie gras ravioli, veal raviolis cooked in broth with white truffle. This was my favorite course(s). I found the white truffle that perfumed the air completely intoxicating. Each preparation was stellar, but the ravioli with the matsytake (japanese mushroom) and foie gras was the most tasty morsel of the night. Possibly the most tasty bite ever; definitely, in recent memory.  Roasted spiny lobster with green curry and fresh coriander. Collectively, we agreed this was the weakest dish of the evening. The lobster was tough and stringy. It looked beautiful, but it was far less satisfying upon digging in.  Caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy. This dish delivered big flavors in the best way. It was another favorite of the night. It had a delightfully unexpected  umami thing going on. Plus, it was sugar and spice and everything nice.  Duo of duck breast and foie gras, five spice sweet and sour grapes with ginger. On paper this course sounds the most to my liking, and don't get me wrong, it was outstanding, but the flavors were similar to those I've had before. I really appreciate when my tastebuds are tempted by something unexpected. That said, this was extremely comforting, especially paired with Joel Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes which we insist is actually potato infused butter.  Coconut lime parfait topped with elderflower liquer gelee and compressed pineapple. The pineapple was incredibly intense. It was so refreshing. It went beautifully with the dollop of cilantro syrup in the center of the plate.  Caramelized vanilla apples tarte tatin with calvados ice cream. The apples in this dessert must have been the same variety that Eve tempted Adam with, I've never had a juicier or more crisp bite of apple. If it is possible to taste a season in a bite, this accomplishes it - no doubt.  You would think we would be unable to consume another bite, but there was still the dessert cart. Calling it a cart, hardly does it justice. It's truly magical. It's hard to believe we showed restraint when choosing about two dozen selections, plus, tiramisu, rum balls and creme brulee.   It was the perfect end to a story book meal. We were incredibly fortunate to enjoy a restaurant of this caliber twice in one year. It is a real pleasure.",

We started with a bottle of champagne on the way, and when we arrived at MGM, we were dropped off at the Mansion through a private entrance, escorted all the way to the hostess stand. Greeted immediately and seated in the most elegant dining room right next to the fireplace. The decor and color scheme was beautiful. Loved the Asian inspired uniforms as well.   Not knowing if I'd be able to make it through the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, I opted to try the Six Course Prixe Fixe Menu.

Sampling off the Cheese Trolley, Camembert and Compte were fantastic. The Bread Trolley. THAT BUTTER! Imported from Brittany, can I get a take home gallon of that?   Dessert Trolley. Not gonna lie. By the time this came around, things were starting to be a little blurry. I had enjoyed my wine pairing, maybe a little too much. I highly suggest doing to pairing, the wines were fantastic. The take home gift of Pound Cake was a nice treasure to wake up to the next morning with my coffee.   I truly enjoyed my meal, from what I remember.",

I have dined in L'ATELIER de Joel Robuchon in Hong Kong and New York, I definitely won't miss Joel Robuchon at Vegas.   The restaurant was only half full when we walked in. The greeting was great and we got seated to the table right the way.  I knew we would have a wonderful dining experience for seamless, attentive service in an opulent and faultless setting.... So classy.  Our waiter wheeling over the bread cart was surprised us, it filled with at least 17 types of bread. I totally fell in love the shaved French butter which among the best tasting with breads.  I opted for the simplest tasting menu - appetizer, entree and dessert. The amuse bouche was pea gazpacho that jelly type of consistency and it's quite thick of it.  I had sea urchin in lobster gelee which was stunning appetizer. It's high degree of adventurousness to capture the eye as well as the palate. The lobster was perfectly cooked and sea urchin so fresh, the consomme jelly was beautifully plated.  The halibut was the star, it was obviously spectacular. It seared with curry oil fennel cream and so delicious. Yet even with high expectations, I was still blown away.  It's more than words could describe the bon-bon trolley (dessert cart), just heavenly! Wow...  wow... wow... It contains over 20-30 sweets that each made fresh daily. Our waiter presented me with the most delicate lollipop while he named off the cart selections. I really couldn't decide what I wanted coz I wish I could have ALL if I have bigger stomach! My assortment of sweets - Strawberries lollipop, toffee eclair, pistachio macaroon, lady bug chocolate tart, tiramisu.  I would say all of the sweets were so delicious especially 6 layers tiramisu!  OMG! My dessert even more surprise... GRIANT chocolate souffle! It's big as grapefruit size souffle! This silky smooth hot chocolate souffle was light yet deliciously indulgent! Seriously, the best souffle I ever had! Final surprise.....We got a gift bag with a bar of chocolate and citrus loaf of citrus bread!  So sweet! We're so enjoy our great meal and such a life time memorable dinner, it totally well worth it",

    "text": "***Joel Robuchon is considered by some as one of the best restaurants in the U.S.; I think the food here is good and the bread and mignardises trolleys provide a luxurious abundance you just cannot get elsewhere, but I actually prefer L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door; that Robuchon restaurant serves much more contemporary, creative, vibrant, and lighter French cuisine***  Because of its three Michelin stars rating (back when Michelin used to rate Vegas restaurants), Joel Robuchon is a restaurant many seek out for a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  I dined at Joel Robuchon a few years ago and I thought it was good but not as good as other great high-end restaurants I have tried in San Francisco and Chicago (I would also put it below the two L'atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants I have tried--one in Vegas and another in Tokyo).  As good as Michelin is at selecting truly special restaurants, it still gives a little too much praise to restaurants from legendary French chefs like Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  For me, these acclaimed French restaurants feel like places where the celebrity chef is not really there that often.  In addition, the food at these French spots just feel outdated and heavy and nowhere near as exciting as the progressive cuisine that restaurants like Manresa, Saison, wd~50, and Graham Elliot serve.  I did think the bread trolley and mignardises trolleys at Joel Robuchon on my first visit were very exceptional--both of these trolleys did deliver the kind of great flavors and textures as well as luxurious presentation that you just cannot find elsewhere (even at great restaurants).  My first trip to Joel Robuchon was for their tasting menu and it was way too much food and it kind of dulled the experience.  My dinner the second time around was a smaller set menu and it actually resulted in a more enjoyable experience even if the food was nowhere near the quality and creativity of The French Laundry or Quince.  Dinner started with a refreshing gazpacho served with creamy burrata and really good extra virgin olive oil.  Next up was a good salad of leafy greens, artichokes, shaved foie gras torchon (creamy, savory and meaty), crostini, and shaved Parmesan.  A warm, sweet and velvety kabocha veolute was the next course.  It was garnished with really good roasted chestnuts, mushrooms and truffle.  The fish course was smoked and then roasted black cod.  The fish flaked very nicely and easily.  The fish was very soft and moist.  I enjoyed the light eggplant puree sauce that the fish sat in; the eggplant puree sauce was brightened up by good yuzu.  The fish was topped with good asparagus.  The meat course was a braised beef cheek wrapped in pasta; it was served with nicely braised winter vegetables, red miso and ginger.  The beef cheek was good; it was very savory, juicy, tender, and quite rich.  The beef cheek was finished off with Joel Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes, which were rich, buttery, thick, smooth, and creamy (the staff at all of Robuchon's restaurants tout this side and it is very memorable for such a simple starch).  Dessert was a fragrant green chartreuse sabayon with refreshing herb sherbet and a nice hazelnut praline at the bottom (mostly sweet but also a little bit salty and a great crispy, wafer-like consistency).  The dinner ended with some good mignardises of mini macarons, chocolates, truffles, pate de fruit, and canele.  Service was very good--professional and polite but also friendly (I felt the service was much more personable on this visit).  The dining room has kind of an over-the-top luxurious look with purple contrasting strongly with black as well as chandeliers.  Prices are very high (even for Vegas standards), but there are a few menu options including the ability to get just 3 or 4 courses; this might be more than enough food given the generous amount of complimentary breads and mignardises served here.  I enjoyed my experience at Joel Robuchon more this time because the food felt a lot lighter.  Still, the food at Joel Robuchon feels dated in parts and for a high-end French restaurant, I prefer the more modern but still classically French Melisse in LA or the French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin where the seafood and sauces both really stand out (even if the food feels slightly dated there too).  If Joel Robuchon is one you have been wanting to try for a long time, I would say that it is worth a try though I would opt for one of their less expensive menus.  If you are just looking for a really good French restaurant, I would suggest L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door, which serves French cuisine very much inspired by classic French dishes but also with a lighter, more vibrant, more contemporary, and more creative style.  Joel Robuchon is located in the MGM Grand.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, the MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",

    "text": "I eagerly awaited this evening as we were having dinner with great friends who also happened to be repeat diners here, and one of them were celebrating a birthday.  I chose the six-course prix-fixe menu and believe me, it is A LOT of food! I'm not going into every little detail about the food, but just more notes regarding our overall experience. We started with an amuse bouche of Beet Veloute with Buratta. Clean, refreshing, great way to awaken the palate of the courses ahead.  The bread cart lived up to the hype where we first received an assortment as suggested by Yann, the person who is in charge of the bread, cheese and mignardise carts. The bread selections were warm, pillowy and tasty, but the star to me was the butter from Brittany,France. Seriously THE BEST butter I have tasted! My next course of the Foie Gras and Artichoke Salad was good, but more of a tease with three paper-thin slices that left me wanting more. My Hot Appetizer of the Soft Egg with Comte Sauce and Iberico Ham was the bomb bite of the evening that was also topped with a gang of shaved White Truffle....:9 So good, I didn't want this one to end.   We had no more bread, we didn't want to fill up on bread, and I sure as hell wasn't gonna let that butter go to waste, so we asked Yann If we could just have the breads that weren't in our first assortment. He has a woman assisting in the dining room put together the bread assortment, and she comes back WITH THE SAME BREADS and they are more stone cold than Steve Austin!? She said that they only warm up the first round,(FYI) eating too much warm bread can lead to indigestion(or something along those lines) and that the chef rather we have space to enjoy other courses. After her lecture at our table, we repeated that we weren't trying to fill up on bread and just wanted to taste the two or three types that we didn't get. \"Oh, we ran out of those\" she replies. Um, newsflash, last time I checked, no Michelin 3-Star establishment  86s ANYTHING(86-kitchen lingo when you run out of something) Her demeanor definitely put a damper on the rest of our evening. We were one of the last tables of the evening, and when one of the ladies in our party passed the bread cart, those breads that she claimed they were out of were indeed there...  Hot Entrees came next. first the Sea Bass, then the Veal Chop. The Sea Bass was exceptional whereas the Veal Chop was okay. The Cheese course was another highlight where I chose a nice blue, a very ripe Camembert, Comte, Reblochon, and Pont l'eveque served with a raisin walnut bread.   The grand finale of desserts was next, where I enjoyed my Sugar Sphere with Yogurt and Blueberry Sorbet. We also had a cake brought out for the birthday boy which was a Vaccherin Glace with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sorbet which happened to be one of the better desserts on our table along with the creme brulee. Our table collectively must've had at least half of the offerings on the mignardise cart which were good, but not memorable....Sometimes, less is more.  From reading other reviews, it seems like couples received better service, as opposed to bigger parties(there were six of us). Not even a baked item to take home as other reviews also stated...maybe they ran out of that too? I doubt my review will make any difference, and keep in mind...this is what our party experienced, so if this is still on your bucket list, go for it!  Glad I can finally take this off the bucket list and for the most part, the evening was very much enjoyed with  good food, great company and the very professional, top notch service from Yann beginning to end...3.5 Stars    ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/   \\uuu/   \\uuu/   \\uu    3.5  YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(12/365) \"3 from Michelin, 3.5 From Me\"",

Pay attention to the dessert cart when you enter, and be forewarned that you will be able to choose from 30 different kinds of cakes, cookies, tarts and candies at the end of the meal.  If you succumb to multiple pieces of the fabulous bread and rolls, with young, green, sweet olive oil and Normandy butter, as I did, you will have to choose judiciously and will therefore have to forego delicacies that you would otherwise be able to eat but will be too full to enjoy.  My husband and I had the 5 course meal, 2 drinks apiece and coffee, and were mostly delighted with the food and service, though we spent the equivalent of a pair of Christian Louboutin pumps.   The only issue I had was the charge for water -- tell them tap, not still, so you aren't charged $10/each for 1 bottle of Evian.  Recommendations (if on the menu):  the dark chocolate souffle, which rose 4\" over the bowl and was worth the up charge, the spaghetti with sea urchin and lobster, which was briny and silky smooth, and the crusted soft boiled egg, which was crispy AND unctuous.",

    "text": "A little background: I have eaten at six (or more) Michelin-starred restaurants in the US and Europe.  In Las Vegas over the past 20 years, I have eaten at more than 50 restaurants and at least fifteen of them high-end ones.  I know proper table etiquette, treat people well, and I am not underdressed when dining.  My review will use incomplete sentences.  Better alternatives in Vegas:  Read any of the one- or two- starred yelp reviews and heed their warning.  Then, take that money and go for a truly fine dining experience in Las Vegas, including Picasso (Bellagio), and you will still have money left over for other (less fancy, but beautiful) meals at Bouchon (Venetian) or Tableau (Wynn).  Decor at Joel Robuchon: Horrible table settings--cheap ribbons around napkins, gold plastic table runner over the nicer linen runner, and sequin-covered styrofoam balls scattered on the table.  Framed photos of celebrities--tacky and unattractive.  Paper napkins for towels in bathroom.  Uniforms for women servers were sad, short-sleeved blouses made for a waitress at a diner.  Overall, pretty room, but smoke pours in from the casino each time the door is opened.  Food: Nothing special; in fact it was hard to find something interesting and I ordered chicken for my main course.  Bread cart has a lot of selection, but none overly fresh (which may be why they warm the first selection you make).  Amuse bouche had shell in the tiny amount of crab that was served in a caviar tin on a tacky plaque advertising Joel Robuchon.  The foie gras appetizer gave only 4 to 5 thin slivers of a pate amongst frisee and a tart dressing.  Chicken was perfectly cooked and came with six mushrooms, including a couple of chantrelles, and creamy potatoes.   Do not order dessert as all menus come with an impressive selection of sweets with tea or coffee.  Service: Without soul and not professional.  Often, servers were gossiping with each other in sight of diners.  NOBODY offered the limo, followed up about my polite and discreet mention of the shell in the crab, consistently attended our table, remembered to return the coat hung in another room, or said \"thank you\" (or anything) as we left the restaurant early in the evening.  I poured my own water and coffee, most of the time.  Sommelier gave fine, not extraordinary, recommendation.    The restaurant was half full on the Saturday night I dined here with a friend.  Perhaps the word is getting out that this is not a good destination, even if you have money to burn.  Shame on Joel Robuchon for giving bad value and on Michelin Guides for giving bad advice.",

We had the full pre fix menu of 12 courses and it was all amazing.  The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and not stuffy. We were seated on the \"outdoor\" patio looking into the rest of the restaurant with no one else to share it.  So romantic. The bread cart was stunning, I was floored by the selection, but since it was going to be a 3 hour dinner I had to hold back. The wine bible was amazing, I've never seen so much in one place. Every course came with a brief description and services was impeccable.  Our waiter was great, friendly and easy going. We had a herb tea cart and had fresh brewed peppermint tea which delightful. Desert was amazing, we were too full to take advantage of the candy cart. At the end they presented Husband with a raspberry meringue cake-let what a surprise that was. Finally as a \"gift\" we received a copy of the menu, a book with images of dishes and a yummy little pound cake to take home.  We couldn't have been more please with out last night in Vegas.",

    "text": "Review is for a 4.25/5  Obviously if you've heard of this place, it's not one of the places where a typical person goes to eat at everyday.  Interiorwise, there seemed to be a majority rule of a dark blue/velvet theme at our table. The waiters were extremely attentive (not surprising at a location such as this).  I opted for the tasting menu if I can recall was the 16 course dinner. They start off with an extremely impressive bread cart with a bread selection that makes you sad when you get back home to your pitiful kitchen of consumer branded bread.  Our first appetizer arrived and my memory turned fuzzy shortly after. I wasn't there to think but to eat so I let my brain take the night off. I lost count of the courses approximately halfway into the meal service and surprisingly I was also full at about the same time. The dishes were decoratively plated with an extreme attention to detail. About an hour or two later, our desserts had arrived. To my recollection, I believe we had a total of 4 sessions of desserts including the dessert cart. Like the bread cart, the dessert cart featured a collection of exquisite desserts ranging from chocolates to cookies. The MVP dessert for that night was the macaroons.   Afterwards, we had a tour of the kitchen facilities and met the staff. Kind of nice to see where all the action happens.  The reason why I didn't rate a 5/5 was because of my personal tastes. Many of my dishes had either caviar or truffles. I'm not talking about one occasion of either item but both of those seemed to be a common theme for the dishes that evening. Personally, I'm not used to eating those often so it would've seemed to my taste buds a bit overwhelming in amount. I would be more comfortable eating at L'Atelier next door if I wanted to be taste buds to be completely satisfied. However, if you're a truffles and caviar fan, you'd be happy here.",

    "text": "This was definitely either the best meal I've ever had or the best meal that I've ever had that I can remember.  Expensive as hell, but if you can afford to splurge, I highly recommend going here.  I had made an online reservation a week before arriving in Vegas, and already table/time options were limited.  But I found that when you spoke to someone during restaurant hours, there were actually more options vs. online.  Also, if you speak to someone, you can arrange for a free limo ride to take you to & from the restaurant.  So the three of us took the limo ride from Mandalay Bay to the MGM Mansion entrance which none of us had ever seen before.  It's a pretty amazing scene to walk through the Mansion, I have to say-- definitely wish I could afford to stay there one time.  The restaurant itself is relatively small and cozy.  We all opted for the $385 per person 16-course menu degustation; and definitely worth the splurge.  It must've been like a 4 hour meal, but we all left totally satisfied.  I won't go into each and every dish, but suffice it to say, we were blown away by practically all the dishes (plus the amazing bread cart and dessert cart)-- I think it was only the cliantro gazpacho that we all kinda slightly shook our head to.  Service was amazing.  Looking around at all the other diners, I'd say we felt somewhat out of place, but servicestaff treated as great.  We all wore jackets b/c we had read somewhere that jacket was required; though there were definitely diners in there without one.  Nice touch to give each of us a rolled up personalized menu as well to take home, and were also nice enough to give us a kitchen tour when we asked.",

    "text": "Having dined at many three star Michelin restaurants around the world, my husband and I decided to make the trip to Las Vegas solely to enjoy a meal at Joel Robuchon.  Unfortunately, we were sorely disappointed. I don't profess to have a sophisticated culinary palate but I can distinguish good food from bad and glitter from substance.  This is a brief summary of my dining experience at the exquisitely warm atmosphere of Joel Robuchon Restaurant. An excellent feature offered was the ability of different diners at the same table to enjoy different dining options.  My husband had the Degustation Menu while I settled for the 2-course menu. The beautifully presented bread cart offered an excellent variety of bread.  The first course of bread was perfect as it was warmed prior to being served.  The second serving of bread was not warmed despite previous comments on Yelp concerning same.  The entire warming procedure would probably take less than 5 minutes but would make a huge difference in attention to details and customer centric service. The serving of the Degustation courses were unevenly paced.  The timing varied between several to 30 minutes.  For the most part each course was presented nicely.  It has been said that one starts eating with our eyes but the creativity of the courses were not original as presentation appears similar from other upscale restaurants thus severely downplaying the \"wow\" factor. The food preparation was also uneven.  My appetizer and main course contained lobster.  Just perfectly cooked lobster should have a just right bite but in both courses, the lobster was so over cooked that the bite was tough. The course of rib-eye steak was perfectly cooked to the correct temperature.  It was listed on the menu as Le Boeuf but should have been named Le Brick.  The meat was tough and far from prime meat.  Since no steak knife was offered, my husband had to \"saw\" his meat. The Signature mashed potatoes was not offered with Degustation menu or my 2-course menu or at least our perhaps forgetful server did not serve us mashed potatoes.  This is a regrettable oversight. The sweets cart was a definite eye opener.  It offered all types of sweets, which would satisfy the most discerning sweet tooth.  Sadly, my joy was short lived. Despite ordering creme brulee and panna cotta from the sweets cart, our supposed fresh treats from the kitchen never arrived.  When mentioned to the server when he was presenting the check, all he said was \"I guess I dropped the ball\" and walked away.  Certainly not the response one would expect from a world-class restaurant. Serving etiquette was not followed.  Same courses served by separate servers were not simultaneously served.  Whichever server got there first just placed the plate removed the cover and left without waiting for other diners to be served. Service was abrupt.  After dropping off the dish, server would quickly mumble what the dish was, speaking primarily while standing behind my husband.  Never were we asked if we enjoyed the dish or any other pleasantries.   The attitude at the restaurant appears to be one of arrogance.  Perhaps they were not expecting repeat customers in revolving Las Vegas.  It was obvious as least to us, that they didn't feel the need to cater to diners who make their business successful since they are already 3 Star Michelin rated. It should be noted that some notable repeat customer was in the dining room and the dining room and kitchen staff were fawning over this customer while basically ignoring other diners. Even Joel came out to hug her. To add insult to injury, $435 is the most we have paid for a 3 star Michelin tasting menu. Especially since the food and service were far from stellar.  Run; don't walk away from dining at Joel Robuchon. You would do better at other finer restaurants where pretentiousness is not on the menu.",

    "text": "Okay, even am surprised at the score that I am giving. It really is a 4/12 stars.   Given the reviews for this place I was surprised that not all the dishes were to my liking.   Don't get me wrong, they were all good, but for what your paying for, my friend and I had the 13 course menu, which is $360 per person, I would have expected all the dishes to \"wow\" my taste buds.  The services is exceptional and the presentation of the dishes were all pretty and inventive.  As it was mentioned somewhere, they have foam on top of everything.  The funny comment this older couple, whom I think we food snobs, said, \"foam is so 2000.\"  The tasting menu that evening consisted of:      *  La Sangria -    Frosty little pearls on top of fruit juice perfumed with blood orange and orange flower water     * Le Caviar -    Cauliflower jelly, rich flan perfumed with asparagus, thin slices of warm scallops with lime zest     * Les Crustaces - Truffled langoustine ravioli, lobster under warm gelee and coral jus, crawfish with arbois sauce and baby spring vegetables     * Les Petit Pois -  Light peas cream and mint on top of delicate sweet onion custard     * L'Oursin -   Sea urchin, potato pure with a hint of coffee     * L'Amada -  Crispy amadai in a lily bulb broth     * Le Bar -    Pan-fried skin on sea bass with five spices served with verjus sauce     * Les Morilles -  Morels and green asparagus, garlic and shaved parmesan     * Le Baeuf de Kob  -  Grilled Kobe beef with watercress tempura, horseradish mustard     * L'Epeautre  - Sault farrow prepared risotto style, gold leaf     * Le Punch  -  Old rum punch, exotic sorbet     * Pom.Pom.Pom   -  apple compote perfumed with vanilla and hazelnut praline     * Le Caf ou le Th   -  escort de mignardises  The dishes which didn't \"wow\" me were the La Sangria, Les Petit Pois, and L'Oursin.   Other than that, the rest were exceptional.  The Kobe beef was flown in from Kobe, Japan.   This was my favorite dish, as the beef just melted in my mouth. I can still remember the taste of the meat and fat, as it dissolved in my mouth.  The Pom.Pom.Pom, also came with a side apple sorbet, which tasted like a virgin green apple martini.    At the end of the, after spending over $1000, they give each guest a take come pastry and a menu of the menu.  Ours was a lemon cake which was divine.      They do request that you wear a jacket, but the the Mary's sitting several tables in front of me didn't have any.  But at the price your paying, I guess they won't turn away a paying customer who isn't dressed properly.  Was it worth the experience, yes it was. Now I have no regrets of thinking, \" i should have went there\", if I never did.",

I remember an exciting amuse bouche of lemon gelee with fennel creme, a delicious frothy asparagus \"cappuccino,\" the most divine and buttery seared scallop, a simply perfect piece of sea bass, and two novel desserts -- one that included subtle-flavored olive ice cream and the other a fantastic pistachio concoction. While those were the standouts, everything was quite good (there were also carpaccios of fish, a lobster soup with geleed vegetables, and a pork chop with spicy mustard). Expensive, definitely,  especially with the added cocktails and wine, but worth it for an evening's experience of the best of food and wine with friends.",

    "text": "One of the best dining experiences by far in my life. I'm very pleased to add this to my list of michelin star/fine dining/gourmand's bucket list restaurants. I came here during memorial day weekend to celebrate my hubby's birthday and the long weekend. The experience starts the moment you step out of your hotel and into their limo which they provide. It's a cool, short ride to behind the MGM and through huge iron gates which open to a secluded circular driveway, bearing the entrance to the Mansion. The pretty hostess welcomed us and led us through the Mansion's stunningly beautiful, climate controlled courtyard garden which is surrounded by villa balconies and patios. I hoped to see a famous face but no luck that time. We proceeded straight into the restaurant after the short walk. I requested a cozy and quiet table so we got one of the huge corner booths which were far from the center of the dining room. However the dining room was small so it we didn't miss out on any of the grandeur of the room with its huge crystal chandelier hanging from the middle of the ceiling and its plush walls and interior. I noticed there was a smaller patio dining room too with a cool moss wall. The plate settings were immaculate in gold.   As you can see I love the setting and atmosphere of restaurants. ON to the food: we each got the four course prix fixe where we can choose a dish for each course. I wanted to get the six but we were going to Ka right after so there wasn't enough time. So for the dishes:  We started with the bread cart and we each got at least two plates throughout the whole night. Do not skip out on this and don't hold back on trying anything! Warmed bread makes all the difference!!  We ordered a half bottle of some good champagne to drink. The sommelier was very helpful and gracious.   l'amuse bouche: can't remember what it was but it was good.  Appetizer: both of us got the carpaccio of lemon scallops. I thought this was the most beautifully and creatively plated. Aside from that, it tasted heavenly.   Soup: both got the Tofu veloute with caramelized eel. It was the most interesting dish; The eel and tofu soup surprisingly complemented each other very well  Entree: both got the duck and foie gras. It was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The foie gras was melt in your mouth of course  Dessert: I got the tahitian vanilla pineapple sorbet with almond panna cotta and hubby got the chocolate sorbet swirl with banana passion fruit cotton candy! Both were absolutely delicious. His came with banana cotton candy! need i say more?   Before the dessert, I also requested to add a plate of cheese. The only reason I wanted the six course was to get the cheese but they graciously offered it to us even when we only ordered the four course. Plus we didn't get charged for it which is truly amazing lol.   Last but not least, since it was his birthday, they brought out a special whole birthday cake! It was very pretty and cute and pink lol. They cut us two slices and it was i believe raspberry and lemon sorbet with a light cookie center and outside (with the texture of macaroon). It was one of the best ice cream cakes i've ever had!   This was truly a great and unforgettable experience and I'm really happy to have shared it with someone special. The staff was very generous, polite, and unpretentious. I would definitely come back here for another splurge (perhaps on their 16 course one day).",

    "text": "The short story:  The service was poor and the food portions were small and unimpressive.  The long story:  The limo ride was nice but it was a slow decent downhill from there.   We were escorted through the entrance of the Mansion at the MGM, which was absolutely lovely, but they led us straight past the champagne and cocktails for the guests (which we were not offered) to wait for 15 minutes in an isolated side room.  One would think that since the restaurant had someone pick us up and drop us off, the need for a wait would be obviated.  A hostess then escorted us out of the Mansion into the MGM and through the casino the the entrance of the restaurant.    We were seated at a table for two across from each other such that polite conversation was not possible without some sort of public address system.  Although I couldn't speak with my dinner partner, I was close enough to the guest at the table to my left I could tell what brand of soap he used.  After asking to be seated where we could sit closer to each other, we were obliged with only a hint that the request was a nuisance.  Once we perused the menu, we went on the extensive wine list.  As we were deciding what we wanted, one of the waitstaff arrived with the bread cart and began explaining the options right over my partner and I both being otherwise occupied  looking at and discussing the wine list.  She did not leave.  She did not pardon the interruption.  She just stood there talking and pointing to the bread.    There were many courses.  It was all quite interesting and appetizing in the descriptions.  When they showed up, most of them did not please the palate.  I won't go into a description of each course and my thoughts because food is very subjective and much a matter of taste, but I will say I was disappointed in all but the braised veal cheeks, they were incredible and I highly recommend them.    Even after multiple courses and many items on carts to choose from, I enjoyed a few things, but was just not impressed overall.",

    "text": "This was my first \"three Michelin' rated restaurant.  The limo ride to the MGM and tour through the exclusive \"Mansion\" within the MGM was nice.   It was great to see where the 'high rollers or celebrities' stay.  The tone of the night started when one of the waitress toss my napkin off my plate rather than unfold it for me.  Several dishes had amazing descriptions and I usually like to ask the waiter  which dishes are the the favorite among guests or even the waiter's preferences.  I asked our waiter and he rudely said \"pick what you like to eat\".    So, since I did not have prompt answers he decided to skip over me all together instead of ask me what I want for dessert etc.   He was quite pretentious.   The service was quite annoying and inconsistent.  We had no clue who our dedicated server was the whole night. As our dishes came throughout the evening, some had explanations others just were placed on the table.   There were a few instances where food was set down and the server walked away and we didn't know if we should start enjoying.  Then as soon, as we take our first bite someone comes by and starts describing our entrees.  Additionally, my future mother in law asked for more olive bread twice during our meal before they brought her some.  And when she asked for tea, there was no honey or lemon with it.  Even when we got up to go the bathroom there was no one there to refold the napkins.  Lastly, towards the end we were not offered more water or if we wanted anything else.   I'm so happy we did not decide to do the tasting menu because I'm pretty sure I would not be able to tolerate the horrible service for 16 courses!  The entrees were tasty but I've had better.   I enjoyed their carts of bread, cheeses, and mini desserts.   The display was quite impressive.  I realized I forgot to ask for a chocolate macaroon cookie and asked our server.   He made no effort to get it for me.     The service was disappointing and the food was 'interesting'; not bad, not as extraordinary.      Overall, the attitude of the restaurant was superior and pompous.  p.s.  The management team's response to our hotel host was:  \"Thank you for the taking the time to pass on this valuable guest feed back, we will make sure that it is shared with the entire team at Robuchon\"  There was no apology and no invitation back.   Customer service is apparently not important for this restaurant.",

    "text": "This was my first truly fine dining experience.  I've been to a few nice steak houses and some well known places in Beverly Hills, but no Michelin rated restaurants.  My Coworkers and I are blue collar guys who had planned a trip to Vegas to have a little fun.  We also like a good barbecue and to cook at the plant.  One day we got to talking about fine dining, one thing lead to another and we decided we had to find a truly great place to eat.  I knew about the Michelin star rating system so I looked up the best rated restaurants in Las Vegas.  This was the only 3 star rated place there.       I was seriously impressed by this place. The limousine picked us up on time.  They took us through the High Roller area of the MGM called the Mansion. The hostess, a quite stunning looking woman escorted us through to the restaurant and seated us. The wait staff were quite polite, never oppressive.  The explained every course as it came out.  When we had questions they were quick and polite with the answers.  One of my coworkers forgot his glasses. We asked if they happened to have any reading glasses and the brought out a VARIETY OF READING GLASSES ON A SILVER PLATTER!       The food:  One of my coworkers and I went for the big menu, The 16 course splurge. My other coworkers went for the 4 course and 6 course menus.  I'll admit this right now. I don't like Asparagus, Mushrooms, Caviar or sushi. All of which were included in the 16 course menu. There were also many different foods that I had never tried before.  However now that I've had them properly prepared I can see why people eat them.  I won't take you through every course, but from the first taste I was blown away! Foie Gras is incredible. The Caviar course was very tasty.  The only thing I truly did not care for was the sea urchin.  Just go in with an open mind and you will not be disappointed. As mentioned in every previous post the bread cart is incredible.  The butter, some of the best I've ever tasted.  Then there is the cheese cart.  It's not included in the regular menu's but trust me and go for it! Try the stinky cheese int the bowl. It's very intense and delicious.  I'm a 300lbs guy and I was completely stuffed by the end of my 16 course meal. I couldn't even look at the dessert cart, but that's okay my dinner included 2 desserts both of which were delicious.       I cannot recommend this place enough.  I am so glad we went here.  Yes it costs a small fortune and no I won't be able to afford eating here more than once every year or two but believe me this will not be my last fine dining experience.",

We also took the MGM limo to the back entrance and through the MGM Mansion.  It was absolutely lovely.  Our hostess was very sweet.  She walked us in to the restaurant and we lounged in the bar for a few minutes till they had our table ready.  We walked through main dining room to the patio, where we had our seats.  The decor is opulent, decadent, but pure CLASS!  I loved the color schemes and the giant chandelier hanging over the plush round banquette seating.  My bf later told me that he was floored with the decor.  Really felt like you were in a heavenly parisian restaurant.  I LOVE FRENCH FOOD!!!  And I thought Bouley and Le Bernardin was great, but oh good mother of God, Joel Robuchon IS THE GODFATHER OF FRENCH CUISINE!!!  And yes, we also opted for the 16 course meal.  The caviar with crab meat on the bottom was HEAVEN!  The UNI with jello was the ULTIMATE.  I'm total UNI connoisseur.   I won't go into too much detail and sound redundant.  I also happen to be a macaroon lover and no other macaroon has compared to that of Bouley's till NOW!  I LOVE macaroons, but I hardly ever get it, since I never found ones that made me fall in LOVE, but Bouley has and boy oh boy Joel Robuchon's tops it with a dollop of chocolate and it drove me into macaroon insaneness.  I know, I know, I'm going crazy over macaroons after a TO DIE FOR 16 COURSE MEAL?!?  I just want to suggest one thing to anyone planning to dine at Joel Robuchon.  Make reservations the last night that you are in Vegas.  We went the 2nd night of our 3 night trip and the 3rd night dinner plan was a hard one to decide.  We weren't sure what we wanted.  Surf and turf?  EHHHH!!  Italian?  EHHH!  What could we possibly eat??  We chose from our usual haunts.  Joe's Stone Crabs or Neros??  Joe's won out.  Eating at Joe's brought us back down to earth from some far and away galaxy light years ahead of our time.  Now it feels like a dream.    Plus this is the best $$$$ I spent.  I woke up the next morning feeling so great about it.  I thought I may feel little, \"WTF, I spent a $$$$ on dinner\" kinda feeling, but NOPE!  It was so well worth it.  The service, ambiance, THE FOOD and my date of course, all well worth it and well deserved.  It was an amazing night!!",

Sparkling chandeliers, beautifully assorted flowers in lavender/fuchsia/purple hues, velvety chairs--it's every diner's dream and I envision every female to fall in love with the decor.  Now for the food. I'm personally not a big fan of French cuisine because its lacking flavor hidden behind a pretentious fascade (usually) but this place is definitely something else. I got the three-course meal with seared sea bass and it was amazing. The kobe beef and braised veal cheeks were also good.    Overall my favorite part was the a la carte option containing a wide variety of delicious desserts and pastries. They bring them out on a cart and each cart is so carefully put-together that you can't help but towant to try every one of them. Service was also immaculate and very attentive.    The caviar with crab meat was also delicious but got too salty toward the end. I'm personally not a big fan and don't really understand all the hype behind it.  The bill came out to over $500 for three girls (I believe we got caviars as service) , which of course, was extremely expensive but well worth the experience. This is one dining experience you cannot miss out on.  I'm definitely returning here with my husband next time I go to Vegas.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this restaurant. I was expecting to be transported, and I guess I'll offer an opinion that is contrary to most reviews on Yelp so it pains me to give this top notch restaurant only two stars.  My wife and I have eaten at nearly every 3 Michelin star restaurant in the US and one in Europe. We've had a lot of high end experiences and very few have let us down. What I can say about Robuchon is that it is a very intellectual restaurant with dishes that are perfectly executed and flawless in its execution. The dishes were neither overcooked or undercooked. What was missing was soul and deliciousness. Three Michelin starred restaurants should have it all -- service, beatiful aesthetics, delicious food that makes you close your eyes in bliss and a wonderful dining environment. Robuchon was lacking in the food department and you can't make up for it in other areas if the food isn't great. I never finished a dish and said to myself \"I would love to have another bite.\"  The first course was a carpaccio of lemon flavored scallops. I adore scallops but the tiny dots that came on the plate were flavorless and I was overcome with the acidity of the lemon and the earthy flavor of the radishes. I finished the dish out of obligation but it was nowhere near delicious. This is a dish that a critic of fine dining would go to town on. All aesthetics and intellect but no soul and flavor.   The second course was the soup and much better. My wife had the best dish of the night which was a tofu veloute with eels that was incredibly inventive and delicious. My pea soup was everything a soup should be. Incredibly exectued and well done.  For the main course, I ordered the duck and foie gras and my wife ordered sea bass and octopus. Beautiful dishes that lacked deliciousness. We just had the duck at Guy Savoy the night before and the contrast couldn't be greater. The duck at Guy was so delicious and we audibly made noises while we ate. It was a joy to eat. The food at Robuchon was pretty but never hit us on a primal level. I dutifully finished my plate but I didn't want more, which is always an important sign to me.   The desserts were ill conceived. My wife had strange popcorn attached to hers that never made any sense on any level and my dessert was a mix of strawberries and chocolate that never worked either.   The service wasn't up to the standards of a 3 Michelin star restaurant. My wife dropped her butter knife early in the meal and it took a long time before someone noticed and replaced it. She ran out of water and had to drink from my glass. I could understand if the restaurant was busy but we ate at 10 p.m. so it was half full.  I guess some chefs you connect with and others you don't. Robuchon has a remarkable reputation but if I were judging him purely on the food that was served and not the rep I would have only given this restaurant one Michelin star.",

    "text": "This place has been on my bucket list for so long. From the outside the restaurant looks so much bigger than it is. Very intimate setting, booths on the corners of the room, a small patio area, and a few tables. When dinner can cost close to $1000 for 2 I guess they don't need much seating.  With all the hype, I really didn't want to be disappointed. This was to be my first 3 michelin star experience, and it was everything I imagined it to be and more. I won't go over all the courses since many yelpers I'm sure have done that and in great detail with pictures to match. Service though was not pretentious like I thought it would be, although the maitre d' was French so maybe he came off just a liiiitle bit, but hey he's French right? We had many people helping us at different times so it was hard to discern who exactly was in charge of what but everything was explained and presented and timed perfectly. Each course was brought at the exact right time and service was impeccable. Bread cart was amazing, so many to choose from that I was glad that the server just told us they would bring an assortment out. Even the butter was amazing with the extra virgin olive oil.   Portions were great, plating was beautiful, even the glassware and dishes they used were things I have never seen before. Petit fours cart was awesome as well after dessert, I just wish I had more room to eat them all.   One thing that I HAVE to mention that I did think was funny though was that there was a picture of Al Gore in the restaurant that my date thought could be him, but  then figured it was a picture of Joel Robuchon at a younger age. When we asked one of the servers if it was Al Gore he said yes. We figured his picture was there because he was a frequent diner, but no. The server said one day he came in and the picture was just there, along with a picture of a young Dustin Hoffman. They both have never dined before and weren't regulars so he said he had no idea why those pictures were there or where they came from. I guess if you're Joel Robuchon and you want to put pictures of random celebrities in your restaurant you can do it, because dammit you are the French chef of the century so you can do whatever you want. We found it hilarious and had a loud chuckle at the table including the server. I think it made people uncomfortable around us.   So I guess 5 stars for me, even if I have to dock some points for the 2 pictures, but everything besides that was perfect.   I also asked for an extra book that they give you of all the courses you had with pictures and descriptions, I didn't want to have to fight my date to the death on who gets to keep it. I wouldn't be afraid to ask, they're very accommodating.",

The bread cart was a little overwhelming with 50+ types of bread to choose from but I'm not complaining. At times, I felt like I was being watched over by the waiters (one of them actually asked me if I didn't like my food just because I didn't finish every last bite).   Overall, it's a great place if you have lots of money to blow on impeccable food and beautiful presentation. It was one of the most impressive meals I've ever had but I could definitely do without the stuffy service.",

The weirdest thing about this place is that there are no windows and you walk out into the trashiest scene of five cent slots when you leave. Bizarre juxtaposition.   If I were to rate this based on value it'd get 3 stars. You can get amazing food almost on par as this for half the cost but my lord is everything , and I mean EVERYTHING HERE DELICIOUS.  Definitely once in a lifetime. I'm fairly positive I'll never be back mostly because I hate Vegas, but secondly because it's practically a down payment on a new home.",

All you have to do is call the restaurant ahead of time and request a limo to pick you up. It was free and all I did was tip the driver. They will drive through the private entrance behind the MGM grand where the villas are located. We didn't see any celebs but I hear its common occurrence. There the host greeted us and led us through the mansion to the restaurant. The whole experience was very VIP and definitely got me brownie points from my date. Oh and of course the food was incredible but that's already been discussed gazillion times.",

    "text": "One of the better meals I've ever had, but I can't say it's the best.  My bf and I each had the 8 course menu and felt so uncomfortably full after our 4 hour dinner that I can't even fathom how anyone could get through the 16 course meal.  After about course 4, it was painful to eat.  Painful.    My 8 course meal consisted of:   Various breads from the Bread Cart.  There were so many specialty breads and they were all so delicious!  You pick and choose which breads you want (and you can have as much as you want).  They heat it up for you and then bring it back.  Be careful you don't stuff yourself with these before you start your actual meal.   Caviar with crab meat.  It was melt in my mouth delicious and set some high standards for the rest of the meal. I wanted to lick every bit of caviar off of what they served it on (it wasn't a plate...I'm not sure to describe it), but I thought that would be very unclassy of me.  I would go back to Robuchon just for that.   Green onion soup.  The description of the soup itself doesn't make it sound very appetizing, but it was good.  Certainly a lot tastier than my bf's Asian inspired soup.   Scallops.  Not that memorable since I don't remember them that much.  They were good as far as scallops go, but nothing mindblowing.   Kobe Beef.  I have to admit, I'm not a Kobe Beef aficionado.  I understand that what makes meat good is fat.  And the small lines of fat in the Kobe Beef only add to its deliciousness.  But I just can't handle seeing that or eating it.  Totally turns me off.  It was quality beef, but just not my thing.  Bf loved it (who is a Kobe Beef lover). He also loved his duck so I'll have to say that the meat dishes were a success.   Potato Puree.  Mashed potatoes, but infinitely better.  In-finite-ly better.  Plate licking worthy (like the caviar).  I liked it so much I might have actually liked the plate if I wasn't disgustingly full by that point.  Hands down the best potato dish I have ever had in my entire existence.    Assortment of cheese from the Cheese Cart.  I love cheese.  High on my favorite food list are potatoes, dessert and cheese.  Just like the Bread Cart, this cart had specialty cheeses that were oh so amazing.  However, due to my fullness, I couldn't consume my desired amount of cheese.   Dessert.  I actually cannot remember what the dessert was.  The only thing I remember is that I didn't like it.  And I love dessert.  I live for yummy desserts.  Bf had the mint chocolate cake (something like that), which I also didn't like.  He liked it though.  Said it was nice and light.  He is not an avid dessert lover so you can decide if that makes his claim legit or not.    Caramel Ice Cream.  This was a million times better than the main dessert.  Quality ice cream is actually hard to come by.  It was light and fluffy and oh sooo good.  I would have asked for a second serving if I wasn't stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey.    All the dessert I wanted from the Dessert Cart.  A definite highlight of my meal.  There were so many desserts to pick from and you could pick to your heart's content.  Once again, I was very sad I couldn't stuff my face with them since I felt so full.  Definitely try the white chocolate and pineapple concoction.  Doesn't sound super appetizing, but it was my favorite.    That was actually more than 8 courses.  3 weeks later and I still can't decide if it was worth it.  I think I would go back again and just get the 3 course menu or whichever is the smallest amount of courses with the cheese and dessert cart included. Otherwise, it's just too much food that you can't even enjoy.      Random info: - Robuchon will arrange for a private limo to pick you up from your hotel and bring you to MGM.  It was a nice little extra.  I recommend doing this as you get dropped off at The Mansion, which is a very private part of MGM.  The limo pulls up to a massive gate that opens up and brings you to what I would describe as a supersized villa, much like you would find in the south of France.  You don't even feel like you're in Vegas - it's so peaceful, beautiful and quiet.  My understanding of The Mansion is it's just a private extension of MGM.  There's even a small casino area (no doubt for some high rollers).  - When handing out menus, they give the menu with the prices to the male.  The female gets the priceless menu.  At least that was the protocol for a male-female table.  A little sexist, I suppose...oh well...",

There is a reason Joel Rubochon's restaurants have received more Michelin stars than any other chef. I took my husband here for his birthday and to our surprise, Mr. Rubochon was in town for culinary week. I approached him for a picture and he was so gracious to take a photo and even sent champagne and a cake to our table for my husband and I. I cannot say enough about the place and the fact that Mr. Rubochon was so humble and generous is enough for me to go back again and again.",

The glass of Cab I ordered ended up to be quite acidic all around. =(  I was surprisingly disappointed.  Slight hesitation when asked for a different glass.  Dude.  If you were going to pay $600 for a meal.  And $30 for that considerably small glass of wine.  I'd expect it to be drinkable?  I should be getting a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape instead! =( =( =(  Sooooooooooooo SAD.   That aside.  All other services beside the wine service were superb.  Amazing bread cart, cheese cart and dessert cart.  Everything was fresh and delicieux !  Ah..... the cheeses and bread..... were to die for.  Love the Duck Foie Gras with mashed potatoes... they were mouthfuls of HEAVEN~ =)    I guess even though I had a 'bad' start.  All the rest of the dinner and services more than made up for it.   All around... an unforgettable dining experience with my love. =)  Thank you Joel Robuchon!  What great vision!    -RaterBabe",

They have free limo pickup and dropoff from your hotel, schedule this when you make your reservation!  Excellent, friendly and accommodating service.  Very nice decor, very opulent French.  You get some of the uncouth Vegas riffraff at times but its Vegas.  Food is excellent, some outstanding and some a bit short.  Dessert was outstanding.  Bread and dessert carts are outstanding.  Nice gift to take home for the ladies.  The ~4.5 course dinner for $148 is a great value, with plenty of food and you still get the full experience.  Highly recommended.  Be aware of the house champagne offered, its $45 a glass.  Will no doubt be going back every time I visit Vegas.",

I sat at the bar and ordered a few dishes instead of going for the tasting menu.  The oyster did not stand out.  But the quail leg with Foie Gras was really good - but you know how small a quail leg is?  I can probably eat 10 whole quails and still be hungry!  The desert assortment was so so.  There are some other dishes that I can't remember anymore. Anyways, can't give it 5 stars because it is too expensive.

    "text": "The restaurant and decor is absolutely  gorgeous! We used the complimentary limo service which came to our hotel to pick us up and take us to the MGM. This was nice. Now for the food. I've dined at many Michelin Star restaurants all over the world. I understand this restaurant received 3 stars back in 2009 but it hasn't been rated since Vegas is no longer part of that Michelin rated guide. So since I didn't dine here in 2009, perhaps it was better back then. The food was above average but not exceptional. Like I said, maybe the quality has gotten worse. The stand out entree was the spaghetti with uni and caviar. But really, if you put caviar and uni on anything it will taste delicious. Not that innovating. So wasn't super blown away here. They had a nice bread cart with a very good variety of bread and a special butter that was imported which was pretty good. I consider the bread cart an entree and was a nice  since it's pushed around on a cart and you have soo many to choose from. They also have a huge dessert cart at the end of dinner. This was really nice. Service was ok. The servers were a bit stiff and robotic besides the guy who was pushing around the bread and dessert cart and refilling our water. Overall, this restaurant excels on presentation. But the food, for the price and service. Not worth it. My favorite entree is usually dessert so I was very excited to eat . I ordered this pear with a chocolate dome dessert and it was DISGUSTING!! I was soo disappointed I wanted to send it back to the kitchen but I held it in. Luckily, they had dessert cart otherwise I would have been extremely upset. have I would suggest going to French Laundry instead. Thomas Keller's dishes are way more fresh and innovative than this place. The entrees/desserts at French Laundry were AHH-MAZZING and more unique. don't waste you money going here. There are far better places.",

    "text": "Indescribable. I think it may be safe to say that I will never have a dinner that surpasses this experience. This restaurant is out-of-this-world good -- as an entire experience, not just in terms of food.   For some background, this is my first fine dining experience. I'm a young professional, so this was a HUGE splurge. With that being said, I had absolutely no guilt spending that much money on one meal. It's not a meal, it's an experience. For those of you that don't want to re-live my entire experience with me, here's the gist of it:  - The food is amazing. Fresh, flavorful, exciting. each plate is handled with care for taste and presentation. - The service is impeccable. They are timely with everything, and attentive to the smallest detail.  - You will want to take your time and savor the experience. I wouldn't go here as a \"before a show\" type dinner. It is an event in itself.  - The atmosphere is perfect. It was definitely what I imagined to be a fine dining restaurant by all means. . . except I didn't feel out of place at all! I think our waiter had a lot to do with it. He had all the etiquette, but also had a very inviting demeanor.  - Take advantage of the complimentary limo service. Being escorted through the MGM mansions is a wonderful way to start and end your experience, and is a great photo op!   Okay, now for the details.  I had opted for the $190 4-course pre fixe menu *amuse bouche, appetizer, main, dessert*, and the bf got the $240 6-course pre fixe *amuse bouche, appetizer, 2 mains, cheese course, dessert*. If price is something you need to take into consideration, keep in mind tax, tip *these guys deserve a good tip, believe me!*, and drinks. We don't drink wine, but even keep in mind that the water is bottled, and non-alcoholic drinks are charged per glass. Completely worth it, considering the caliber of the rest of the meal, but just something to keep in mind.   My favorite from the bread cart was the milk bread. I couldn't help but take seconds. :x* Every course was great. This is food you will eat slowly because you WANT to. I noticed even leaving out one small item on the plate would make a difference in the bite of food I ate. The highlight dishes were the Tofu veloute with caramelized eel *I wasn't sure how this would be, but I wanted to get something different than the bf.*, and the La Langoustine. Even though my menu did not come with the cheese cart, our waiter asked me if I would \"be so kind as to help\" my bf with his cheese course. I thought that was nice. After our courses was coffee and tea. Since it was for my bf's birthday, they came out with a miniature cake for him. That was dessert #2. As a note on their attentiveness: I was reaching the bottom of my tea pot, and our waiter insisted he get me a new pot because he thought the tea looked a little too dark/burnt *I actually thought it was fine*. To finish the meal, the sweets cart was brought to our table. We each picked a few, and then our waiter picked a couple more for each of us. He paid attention to the types we picked, and made his selections accordingly. That was dessert #3. After we finished, he stopped by, placing another tray of sweets and saying \"I told the chef how well you both did tonight, and he allowed me to pick a few more items for you\". On to dessert #4. Before we left, he handed us a couple of the wrapped caramels and chocolates from the cart to take home. Dessert #5?  Lastly, the check came with a goodie bag for me *I believe all the ladies got one*, which contained a booklet about the restaurant that also included the menu *a great souvenir*, and a Joel Robuchon chocolate bar. Dessert #6!   Our 5 hour *yes, 5hrs!!!* dinner flew by. I could have stayed there forever. The next morning, the bf and I had a very hard time trying to figure out what to eat. After Joel Robuchon, nothing sounded good. :(",

The portions didn't look that big, but when I left, I was stuffed.  We had the prix fixe that included an amuse bouche, appetizer (entree) and main course (plat principal).  We ate caviar, corn with lemon gelee, lobster salad, fois gras, veal cheeks, sea bass, and the famous mashed potatoes.  The prix fixe also included an amazing bread cart - no seriously, I can't tell you how amazing this bread cart was, and I don't normally eat much bread, but this was so good-- coffee (french press, of course), and chocolates/sweets cart.  These carts were ridiculous - piled high with dozens of varieties of mouth-watering breads and sweets, beautifully decorated.   For drinks, my husband got a dirty martini, which was also perfect (I can still taste it), and I got 1/2 bottle of russian river valley chardonnay.  I have never felt so spoiled in a restaurant in my life.",

Nonetheless their presentation has been  always super and no doubt a Michelin 3 star restaurant, but the taste of the food was somehow inconsistent this time.   If you are spending over $1k for dinner you would expect perfection. During my 3rd and 4th visit, some of the dishes which I felt were quite salty and over seasoned - black cod, scallop and pasta. but they were still very flavorful.   Their signature dishes were always the best and delicious - langoustine ravioli, caviar on king crab, the bread cart, mashed potato and the desert cart  I'm still highly satisfied.",

    "text": "Looking for a perfect dinner? Try Joel Robuchon. From the fine quality of the ingredients to the elegant presentation of the dishes, the cozy yet upscaled ambience to the professional and considerate servers, everything in this restaurant was no doubt top notch. Not to mention the unforgettably delicious dishes along with their generous portions.   Food: We went with the full chef's tasting menu- four services of appetizers (which amounted to ~14 small dishes), one main dish, and two desserts. The most memorable course was the main dish- slow cooked chicken and foie gras in wine sauce with asperigus and mash potatoes on the side. This was not the main dish (braised lamb shoulder) pre-seleted in our menu but was something our server considerately improvised for us as we were too full for the lamb, which turned out to be the highlight of our meal.  Service: Professional, considerate, and very knowledgable in food and wine.  Atmosphere: Purple themed, with royal decorative elements.   Price: $1400 for two.",

He was not very personable and at times seemed condescending. Maybe it's because we are relatively young, but we all know good food (we had a party of 10) and like traveling and, when doing so, dining at the world's finest restaurants. Whenever he walked in the room (we had the private dining table), the mood dampened and we just waited for him to leave. However, the waitstaff were very personable and enjoyed how much we were enjoying the food and wine and cocktails.   4 stars. Because I have had food in the same ballpark, but with much better attention from the host.",

    "text": "Ding-ding-ding!  Are you ready to rumble at the MGM Grand?  Ready for three hours of dining at the Joel Robuchon?  We sure were!  The first round started slow...my Sig Other and I bobbed and weaved through the the extensive menu.  JR threw out multiple combinations, 2 Apps - 2 Entrees - Dessert, 2 Apps - 1 Entree - Dessert, etc. . and watch out for the haymaker Degustation uppercut which will give you a tasting of all the skills of JR.  The wine menu was also extensive with assistance from the corner man as necessary!  After a dizzying first encounter with the multiple page menu in which we both selected the 2-1-D combo, Round 2 started with the \"Amuse\" and the +20 item Bread Cart in which the Server described in great detail each item.  We were in a daze and managed to request..the one with Sea Salt, the one with Basil, the one with Bacon, the Croissant.  Of course they had names for each of these but who could remember the intricate names, thus we requested by ingredient.  Now that we were warmed up, the first appetizer came at us.  My wife had the Salmon Tartare with Caviar and I had the Foie Gras.  Both were head-shaking excellent.  I wanted to lick the plate but opted not to as I wanted to make it to the next Round without being walked out of the ring.  Round 3 was over and stars were swirling around our heads from the goodness.  The next appetizer came at us with a vengeance...wife took the first punch with Kaboucha Squash Soup and I took an uppercut with the trio of Langostine Ravioli.  Nice one - two JR.  Fifth Round Main Event had me with the mmm..mmm..good Spiny Lobster while the wife had the Black Eye Cod.  Great sauces along with great presentation.  The presenters coordinate the delivery of dishes to the table and simultaneously lift the glass warming covers at the same time.  Nice artistic presentation while also excellent job descrivbing the dishes in depth.  We still weren't done yet and JR tried to sweeten the fight by bringing out the dessert.  These were beauties as I had the Chocolate Raspberry Forest looking Dessert in a tilted wine glass while wifey had the Lychee Sorbet with Coulis.  Both were artistically done.  JR was still not done with us and decided to bring out another cart...yes the dessert cart with small bite sized eclairs, lollipops, macaroons, tartlets, chocolates,...we were almost in a food concussion from the combinations thrown at us by the gifted folks at JR.  The last punch that knocked us out for good and done for the evening was a gift wrapped cake in a Joel Robuchon bag.  Since we were flying home the next day...the TSA folks X-rayed the cake for hidden objects...I kept thinking..hands off our cake!  Great job Joel Robuchon and we look forward to a rematch in the future!  Expensive engagement but worth the fight.  You have a great fight team!",

    "text": "Being in Vegas, we had to go big and try Joel Robuchon, one of the most famous chefs out there. This was one of the coolest experiences ever. If you request for a limo, they'll pick you up from wherever you are, and drop you off after. That was an amazing touch. While we didn't get the golden limo, they sent us a black Chevy Suburban to get everybody - free!  As for the meal, the visual of the food does not equate to how most of the other Michelin 3 star restaurants look. Restaurants like Alinea in Chicago focus purely on aesthetics, and not so much on taste. I felt that Joel Robuchon focuses much more on tastes, since each bite was absolutely mindblowing. As for visual representation, most of the plates were just normal looking.  We ended up opting in for choosing our main entrees, appetizers, and desserts. That is already a ton of food. We tried many of their cocktails, all of which are absolutely top notch and strong.  The dessert cart was the highlight - trying all these different macaroons, chocolate mixes, and more.  I would gladly come back here as the food was delicious. The taste is much more important than the visuals.",

    "text": "Fantastique!  I have been planning to go to Robuchon for a long time but never went.  Last night before seeing MGM's Crazy Horse Paris before it closes, I decided to make it a grand evening of food and entertainment.  The meal.  I selected the 6 course meal.  For an amuse-bouche, they brought a bowl of avocado foam with grapefruit and apple.  Smoke was coming out from the sides of the bowl from a couple of pieces of dry ice concealed in the lower section.  The bowl was sitting on a plate that had apples all over it.  The smoking bowl and the apple plate went with the restaurant's fall theme.  It was very pleasing to the eye and to the palate.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  Before the first course, the server came with the bread cart.  I chose a bacon bread and a basil roll.  He took them away to be warmed and while they were being warmed, he pulled a nice curl of butter from the large bell shaped mound of butter.  On this curl, he spooned some coarse sea salt.  Perfect!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#cG0hupMF2hno9oNJFQzTFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vhZqX8iJde17fytPkzjdYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  The first course was spiced lobster in a cold cauliflower soup with botargo shavings.  This was excellent.  The lobster and the cauliflower made a good combination.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#qEPSaCG4mph3gwtwMSCgkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  Second course was a pumpkin veloute with foie gras, ginger foam, and toasted seeds.  The pumpkin veloute was poured into the foam from a separate container by the server.  There were also small cubes of pumpkin for texture in the veloute.  Very tasty pumpkin flavor with the lovely ginger to add an extra layer of flavor.  The foie gras was superb!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#Yoc7fLdK93DmTfocE3vS2g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  For the third course, I went back to lobster.  I got the spiny lobster served with yucca root in a green curry with fresh coriander.  Another winner.  Very good.    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=_yPlRv5dbAHb6aC0TKQ0Hg#vMMAmXsQT8J7zxTXCmYRqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  For the fourth course, I chose a special that wasn't on the menu.  They had lamb chops and lamb loin.  It was very flavorful.  With this course, they brought some pommes puree and a finger bowl with a slice of lemon and one rose petal.  After all, you have to clean your fingers after picking up the lamb chop to finish the meat from the bone.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#anOfKURZUpLKafsNDbh6ew\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#QtU_80wjNrJZwFrVkYQpOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zFf11ODymwTGaz2wovhjiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  The 5th course was the cheese course.  By now, I was feeling full and I knew there were more good things to come.  I chose three cheeses--some bleu, a French hard cheese similar to manchego, and a soft sheep's milk cheese.  All three were good, but the bleu was outstanding!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#1ZeLTWxdkqNNrSQ0cK09zw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  With the cheese course, you were brought a raisin roll.  It really adds to the cheese flavors.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#zAdat0jo4ZV4Z5YH-fhq9Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  For the last course, dessert, I ordered the pistachio mousse glazed with chocolate ganache and raspberry gelee.  Heavenly, rich, dark chocolate!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#XqZUNyWMVX8_poZCZExiMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  Last, the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table. Wow.  Such a choice.  I took three, a dark chocolate demi-macaron, a vanilla macaron, and a small tartlet with raspberry and cream.  What a delightful way to end a meal and now I was very full.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jo%C3%ABl-robuchon-las-vegas-5?select=eKgLhGdwNq1cDXB24AmWdA#wf4xOVg4-mfqu0liI7xk6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joel...</a>  Service was exemplary!  There wasn't one staff member who wasn't polite and who didn't have a smile.  The whole package--the food, the fall theme with the flowers of reds and oranges, the plates with apples and pumpkins, the service and the general ambience of this quiet, elegant restaurant--makes for a fine dining experience.  I'd love to go back and try the 14 course menu but I'm afraid I couldn't eat that much.   Thanks to my Yelp friends who encouraged me to go here and gave me pointers, especially Rod and Marcus!",

The course's come out in four service's each containing three small dishes , that are presented in the most beautiful way.  This is pure art, with a larger main course of beef.  We ordered the cheese cart in addition to the desserts and needless to say we were busting at the seams but what a way to go!

From the minute you are collected in the gorgeous gold car, it feels like a different world.   You enter via the gated entry and it is absolutely stunning. The private garden is breathtaking. The entry is quiet and understated.   Our last visit was in the walled patio and we loved it. This time, we had a comfortable corner booth and it was a surprisingly different experience. We could watch smooth and seamless serving presentations and delight of other diners. It was much more entertaining and engaging. The service is perfection and it's lovely to see how this is achieved.   As for the food and wine, it is simply spectacular!    The chilled lobster in a refreshing light sweet sour sauce was my favorite dish of the night. Three stunning pyramids of lobster in a light glaze.   We were able to try parts of the brilliant vegetarian menu as well. We all tried the perfectly poached egg with a light spinach and cheese sauce. Perfect with the bacon bread.   For my main dish, I went the the lobster and it was so perfect, it actually made me giddy. That and the two glasses of champagne....  We also tried the rich and complex rib eye with bone marrow and perfectly prepared black cod. Everything is so expertly prepared that each element is breathtaking. The warm dishes come out in glass domes. Each dish arrives and is presented at the correct temperature. The mash potatoes are so smooth and silky, they melt in your mouth.   The stunning desserts all all presented in a unique and magical way. I has the chocolate and cherry extravaganza and it was a work of art. It looks like a colorful magic mushroom in a sideways wine glass on a square plate of gold Murano glass. There were tiny green \"moss\" covered balls that are actually steeped cherries. Underneath the mushroom are crispy buttery cookie bits. All of the desserts are spectacular and delicious but the cherry mushroom is out of this world!  The bread cart is beautiful and each bread is unique and bold. Everything is so unusual and so beautiful. They bring the bread cart around frequently and are happy to bring anything you could possibly want. There is also a wonderful domed butter and olive oil for the wonderful breads. We tried as many as possible.  We are all dessert fanatics and the dessert cart made three trips to our table. Only when we couldn't possible eat another bite, dinner came to a close. There are beautiful tiny tarts like jewels, chocolates and jellies of every imaginable kind. Even tiny pops of chocolate and marshmallow. Amazing.  The charming chef greeted us and we were able to fawn over his skills. Before we left we were presented with gift bags with tea cake. Everything and anything you could possibly think of. Almost three hours later, we made our way, winding through the Baccarat tables and beautiful art work. There was a tray, with more champagne, while we waited for our car.   This is a beautiful and unique experience. I love the elegant dining room room with a bit of whimsy and drama to remind you, you're still in \"over the top\" Las Vegas.  I can't wait for our next visit. This is a spectacular experience and you will remember it forever.",

Having eaten at 2 L'Atelier's, I was pumped to finally make it to THE one and only mother ship Joel Robuchon. Being on Vegas time, we ate lunch 3 hours before our reservation, so we downsized from the massive $445 tasting menu to the still massive $200 two app, one entree, one dessert option, which still took a whopping FOUR hours.  ATMOSPHERE Vegas over the top opulence without being tacky  SERVICE Solid, not as tight as a 3 star Michelin but like a 2 star.  FOOD - Bread cart - This carb slut was all over this cart like nobody's business. The bacon bread was the standout. - Corn soup w/duck prosciutto amuse - great sweet and salty balance. Damn the duck was good. - Scallops and shrimp - Someone had to go blind to plate this, a shade over cooked and a bit bland. - Foie gras - DUH this was good. How can it not be? - Sous vide veal, morels and dumpling - Again sightly over cooked and bland, but the dumpling was tasty. - Herby sorbet , can't recall the deets, but super refreshing and yummy. Beautiful presentation. - Chocolate souffle - OMFG. The lightest , creamiest, most perfect souffle I've ever had. So big my friend couldn't finish it. Pure magic. MAGIC!!! - Mignardises cart, looked pretty and I went hog wild on half the items but none were really great. The macaron were sadly straight up below average.   Oddly he take home gift was a pound cake. How bizarre.   DAMAGE We don't drink and just had water and tea/ coffee, probably had the lowest bill of the night at $300/person after T&T. If you drink and do the full tasting, it could be easily headed over 4 figures. Definitely one of the most expensive menus in the US.  The experience was worth it but JR's food underperforms relative to other 3 stars, except for that freakin' souffle.",

    "text": "Robuchon The Pinnacle of Fine Dining in Las Vegas.    If Gastronats were to pray 5 times a day, they would definitely be facing Robuchon. In the era of anti-capitalism a la Bernie Sanders, the one percenters can find refuge here. But for those wanting to celebrate a special occasion or seeking enlightenment like burned out cooks such as myself, there's a need to make the pilgrimage to Vegas, forget the other vices, and pay tribute to one of France's legendary Chefs. From the crystal chandelier hanging in the high ceilings to the custom made china, the plush ultra elegant dining room adorned with artwork and expensive vases can't compare to the grandiose once in a lifetime feast.  One bite of heaven, a little quinoa sphear with a yellow pepper coulis. Next, a crystal bowl of Strawberry Gazpacho with silky Burrata cheese and 12 year old balsamic. The sense of wonder came as a deconstructed tomato appetizer out of the pages of Art Effin' Culinaire magazine came to my table. I just got told what a tomato's supposed to taste like. A cart full with artisanal breads like Gruyere, bacon, and rosemary flavors could have been a nightmare for the gluten free crowd, but for me, it was bread heaven with some sensuous extra virgin olive oil or room temperature butter sprinkled with luxurious flaky sea salt. The lobster with sweet and sour dressing and thinly sliced radishes should be Maine's state dish.      The evening progressed in somber amazement to the realization that at this point in time you are experiencing the very best of haute cuisine. The veal was rosy pink with carefully adorned chanterelles topped with explicit white foam. Peppercorn crusted Wagyu beef rib eye expertly charred, med rare inside, melted in your mouth, ecstasy, a delicate bite of bone marrow protruded outside the bone that said eat me punk. All followed by, art on a plate, a blown sugar lemon filled with cool lemony goodness. And of course, that famous dessert cart filled with the most decadent one bite treats.  It might not be El Celler de Can Roca or Noma, but in my opinion, they are bishops and Joel Robochon is the potentate. Kudos to the staff for the relentless hard work, you deliver complete excellence.",

    "text": "I think the challenge is to be brief  I had heard about the $450 super deluxe and I was a little panicked when I found out that my wife made reservations for our anniversary.  Turns out that there are some other Prix fixe options, and that makes this place reachable for us public servants.   The food is out of this world delicious and the presentation makes the food almost impossible to eat as you feel like this isn't meant to be put into your cake hole.    As with most french cooking the portions are not enormous, however I had no shame in filling up on the other stuff.  They have a bread service with about 20 different kinds of breads.  Don't be shy about taking multiples or asking for seconds.  It's all part of the package and amazing.    At the end of the meal comes the sweets cart.  Another opportunity to glut out and get your money's worth.  You already paid for it.    I have a feeling that the dishes change so commenting or recommending any specific one might be silly.  Every dish we had was absolute perfection.   Every entree also comes with the famous mashed potatoes.  Don't take this as an insult, but you know those instant mashed potatoes that you got from the cafeteria as a kid.  They had this silky smooth texture that mom could never duplicate.  When you first take a bite that's the thought that comes to your mind. It's a lovely comforting thought from childhood, but the taste is like nothing else.  I don't think I can pick out all the flavors that make this dish world famous.    What sets this place apart from any other restaurant I had every been to or will ever go to is the service.  Everyone in the restaurant has a role and from the butter service, to the bread service, all the dishes of the meal, and the sweets cart, all of the parts move smoothly, elegantly and professionally.     I would recommend this for any foodie.  Even if you do a smaller menu, it's pretty affordable.  It's a once in a lifetime experience.",

    "text": "Updated review after 2 years.  Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas remains our favorite restaurant of all time.  I highly recommend everyone put the Grand Degustation Menu on their bucket list for an epic, unforgettable meal.  As of this writing, you can easily cover dinner, drinks, tip and tax for 2 by selling a single share of Amazon Stock.    For this review however we took a different route with their Express Ala Carte Menu.  The base is $250/pp (instead of $445/pp for the full 14-17 course tasting menu), and you get to choose 2 apps, 2 mains, and 1 dessert.  Each person can customize the selections, and you still get unlimited bread in the beginning and candy at the end.  Portions tend to be bigger than in the Tasting menu for the same item - so you will still get full!  Our selections (note some will have surcharges that add to the $250 base)  Apps: * We got two caviar dishes.  I prefer the Le Saumon with a meatier salmon tartar base.  For more delicate, eggy dish but with nice texture contrast, the Le Caviar Imperial is also good. * Le Homard was an amazing lobster pot-sticker like dish but with the wrapper made of thin turnip.  Definite Asian-inspired and the lobster was so delicate! * Le Potiron was a pumpkin cream soup served in a pumpkin, with big thin slices of white truffle for added umami!  Mains: * My wife loved Le Black Cod, bringing back Asian flavors of sweet miso soy to a soft, melt-in-your-mouth fish.  *I loved Le Saint Pierre, a firmer John Dory filet with serious crunch from the tempura shiso leaf.  I also liked the thick, briny squid ink risotto. * Le Boeuf offers a few good-sized pieces of super-tender, well-flavored rib eye.  The mushroom ravioli had a surprise with some foie gras inside.  Meat and potato dish, but when the mashed potato (90% butter/10% potato/100% awesome) is from Robuchon, its definitely a must-get dish. * Le Veau is braised veal cheeks, with the tender, savory meat balanced by the nice, gingery Thai broth which really cut some of the richness away.    Desserts: * The lightest dessert is probably the Le Parfum des Iles, similar to a banana colada if such a thing existed.  Sweet, sour, and foamy.  * For an absolute gorgeous dessert that looked like something from Super Mario, Le Chocolate offers a chocolate-cherry masterpiece that looks like a colorful mushroom in the garden.  Happy to maintain my five stars for Robuchon, and in my opinion it remains my favorite 3-Michelin restaurant.  The ala carte menu is a nice change of pace if you want to customize the menu and want a slightly lighter dinner.  However you will still leave the restaurant full and satisfied.  More time for you to catch an evening show or to gamble!",

    "text": "Reviewing a place like this is sort of like writing about a gas station.  I mean....are you really going to avoid getting unleaded fuel or an exquisitely presented John Dory entree from the chef of the century because of what some random person said on Yelp?  Doubtful.   Our 10th wedding anniversary called for an extra special dinner and a second visit to Joel Robuchon, six years and 305 reviews later, definitely fit that bill.  We had full intentions of going with the 18 course dinner when my petite wife balked at the very last minute, fearing she would not be able to complete it.  Looking back now...she would NOT have.  So we opted for the $250 per person menu, consisting of amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert.  This also included the amazing bread cart, dessert cart AND they threw in a lovely anniversary cake.  We were also gifted a decent size citrus poundcake just before wrapping up the 4.5 hour dinner.....ya know..to enjoy in the car.      The \"Le Caviar Imperial\" is the greatest thing I've eaten in 2017 and well worth the $65 supplemental fee.   It all started with a base of delicious smoked salmon and luscious creme, then what I can only describe as the most amazing soft-boiled egg  (I swear there were drugs in that yolk!) wrapped in a crispy (maybe potato?) nest and then topped generously with excellent caviar.  Loading up a bit of each on a spoon and slowly savoring it was total food ecstasy.      Perhaps \"supplemental\" has another meaning in French like \"You'll love this shit and regret not getting it\" because we also splurged on \"La Langoustine\", a signature dish of Mr. Robuchon, for $35 more featuring truffled langoustine ravioli topped with an airy foie gras sauce and served with simmered cabbage.   Unbelievable!!  It was kind of like eating the fanciest deconstructed gyoza ever.  The second go around was a better dinner experience overall because we knew what to expect, like how to pace ourselves by not going super nuts on the delicious bread cart and avoiding going with consecutive super savory dishes to balance the meal out.   From the grilled ribeye to the pan-fried sea bass to the bubble sphere dessert filled with blueberry yogurt sorbet, everything was once again outstanding!  I am unsure when visit #3 will happen, but it's going to freakin happen.   If you're looking for a possible way to save some moolah for this kind of splurge, I did save $150 using points I had accrued from my MLife Mastercard, which I initially got just to park for free at MGM Resorts.  The players club can convert the points prior to dinner and certainly made the bill a little less painful.",

Often times the dishes try too hard to be different at the expense of food taste and quality.  Not at Joel Robuchon.  Here, every single dish I tried was flavourful, artfully presented and logical.  The bread cart was amazing and I don't even like bread.  Every single thing I tried I'd order again.  The ambiance was great (love the green wall) and the wait team came at all the right times.  While they have their Menu Degustation at almost $500 a pop, it's not necessary to get that to have a fantastic experience.  On the day we went we just weren't quite hungry enough for the large menu, so we got the smaller choose your own menu options (2 entrees, 1 plat and 1 dessert) and that was still too much.  So don't feel like you can only go if you get their Degustation Menu!  Even their entry level options are well worth it.  Definitely will be returning!",

I enjoyed my interactions with all of them. I'd give the staff 5 Yelp stars!  Knowing you're dining at a 3-Star Michelin Guide restaurant means very high expectations when it comes to the food part.   There are four fixed menu options: $250, $198, $169, and $127. We opted for ordering from both the $169 and the $127 menu. The $127 menu is a main course and dessert, and the $169 menu has an appetizer, main course, and dessert.  We were surprised when they brought out a couple complimentary items before the appetizer. One was a cold soup dish which was delicious.   They have a wonderful selection of bread to choose from, so many that it's easy to be overwhelmed, no worries, just try what looks good. Hint, they are all good. They even give you some butter from Brittany and some very fine Spanish olive oil to go with it.   For an appetizer, we split Le Homard du Main, Main lobster in a thinly sliced turnip. It was absolutely beautiful. The lobster was tough and chewy, a huge disappointment. No staff actually ever came over to check on any of our courses. It would have been nice to tell them it wasn't quite up to par.  For main courses, we had the John Dory fish fillet and the Le Black Cod. The filet was OK, not incredible,  but the black cod had too much Malabar pepper sauce that took away from the flavor of the fish. The presentations of both dishes were splendid, though.   For dessert, I had La Sphere. It was so beautiful that I felt bad breaking through the outer shell. It was perfect!  Wait, there's more. After dessert, they brought out a cart full of bite-sized sweets. Every one of them was a work of art and every one of them was delicious.   Our tab before tip was $379.96. A glass of chardonnay was $36. A better way to go would be to split a half bottle of wine. Much better deal.  I'm glad I had this fine dining experience. This 3-Star Michelin restaurant gets three Yelp stars. It was very good, but it wasn't great. My world traveling fine dining aficionado friend agrees.",

They were so attentive to us and our requests. This is clearly of 3 Star Michelin restaurant.   We ordered the 17 course meal and it was an adventure on each plate. I have never experienced French food and this was hands down the best way to experience it. My taste buds tasted flavors I have never experienced before! This is definitely a must for anyone looking to fine dine in LV and have an experience like none other. I recommend making reservations ahead of time as well as setting aside a couple of hours to really enjoy each flavor and dish. Enjoy!",

Every aspect of this restaurant is the very definition of class and refinement.  From making the reservation, to the greeting from the hostess and every encounter with their team, it was obvious that their objective was excellence.  I seek out extraordinary restaurants and I've not found one that offers an experience that compares.    The tasting menu had a great balance of offerings with the highlight being the seafood dishes - the scallops were bewildering.  The dessert offerings were overwhelming and sumptuous.  Every presentation was stunning and I took photos of each dish.  I also opted for the wine pairings.  It was great because I didn't have to make decisions and their sommelier frequented my table with interesting knowledge on each offering.    The experience lasted several hours but the memories of it will likely last a lifetime.  I can only hope to return on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

I however, was treated rudely over the phone while trying to make the reservation. That dose of snobby, stuck up attitude almost made me cancel...   The food was delicious. Nothing out of place.   The bread cart was AMAZING! I HATE bread and here I was picking a variety of breads to taste!   MY FAVORITE PART-  is the pastry cart! It was like a Willy Wonka cart coming to your table with endless variety and tasting options! I was like a kid again! It is included with your dinner!

    "text": "Definitely lived up to the billing of the ONLY Michelin 3 stars restaurant in Las Vegas (  3 STARS FOLKS 3 STARS) . Made reservation for 5:45pm on a Friday for my wife and I wedding anniversary. We were seated right away. The staffs were all friendly and accommodating. I opted for amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 main course, mignardisis and a dessert for $250. The wife thought that was a bit too much food for her, (she was right by the way) so she went with a glass of red wine, amuse bouche, 1 appetizer, 1 main course and mignardisis (selective sweet) for $169. Some of the choices does have supplemental charge. For example for one of my main course I went with the spaghetti on a lobster bisque with roasted Maine lobster and caviar. $65 was added to my $250. Of course this was all explained to us when our waiter went over the menu. So there was no hidden tricks here folks. The breadcart was fantastic. You are more than welcome to choose whichever and how many you want from the bread cart. Once you made your selection they will proceed heat up your bread selections and bring them back to your table. Same goes for the selective sweets, anything you want from the dessert cart you can have. The wife really enjoy the dessert cart a lot. The food were exquisite. How their chef plates them were just down right beautiful and artistic. They have also gave us complementary cake for our anniversary which was really nice. The whole meal took close to 2.5 hours. Never felt rush when we were there. Felt like the whole meal was a production play. Overall it was an amazing and unbelievable dining experience.",

We went with the 18 course menu and just WOW. One of the first courses foie gras just melted in your mouth. The miso cod was cooked to perfection and the beets with the mustard sorbet AMAZING. The setting was perfect it seemed whenever one course was done there was a waiter to whisk away your plate and bring out new utensils. They have a bread cart...A BREAD CART... 11 different choices of house made bread. You make your selections and they warm them up for you! The butter is a HOUSE-MADE stand up log...a waiter comes to your table and slices a curl of butter sprinkling it with just the right amount of salt. Oh my goodness and the desserts?! Don't get me started!! To top off the night you are given a treat to take with you...delicious lemon glazed pound cake beautiful packaged. Highly recommend this restaurant this experience on every level imaginable.",

    "text": "Located at the MGM Grand (which charges for parking now unfortunately), Robuchon is a pretty unique experience. It has not one, not two, but three Michelin stars. Perhaps this accolade inflated my expectations when it came to the food, ambiance, and service. However, the total came out to be over $400 for per person without wine pairing, so I believe the price justifies some high expectations.  We came here to celebrate a career milestone and ordered menu A: amuse choice of 2 appetizers, two main courses, dessert and sweets. We were going to order the tasting menu that included more dishes (costing near $500) but there were so many vegetable dishes that we decided to pass.  Food: The most memorable dishes included the pink shrimp on green garlic veloute and lemongrass foam and the carmelized iberico pork. The sauce with the pink shrimp was delightfully refreshing from the green garlic and lemongrass while being packed with flavor. The carmelized iberico was so tender and juicy I really thought I was eating steak!   Dessert was quite fun. They rolled out a cart of sweets and treats for us to select to our heart's desire. I even had a marshmallow lollipop.    The dessert that came with the tasting menu, the blueberry sugar sphere, was beautiful but it tasted very sweet and not blueberry-like at all.   Service: Service was attentive and good. Something a little odd was that they gave me a menu with a page duplicated so I couldn't find the page I was looking for.   I heard that they used to have a limo service to pick their customers up to take them to the restaurant but that doesn't exist anymore.   Ambiance: Plush purple couches and glamorous chandeliers. It's a quiet atmosphere. Also, there's a section that has a faux green foliage wall that would've been fun to be seated in. I also did get the vibe that the crowd was a bit older and so being a bit young was a bit awkward.   I'd recommend the experience, but probably won't be back until I'm older or my money has aged a few zeros.",

    "text": "World-renowned for a nouvelle approach to haute cuisine garnering a 3-Michelin Star rating, Joel Robuchon is a force to be reckoned with. In amidst myriad of terrible Vegas buffet and smoke-filled casinos, the superfluous dining experience at Robuchon ranks among the likes of Manresa and French Laundry in California.  As attendants greeted me while swinging open the double doors followed by more greetings from the maitre d', I found myself decadently surrounded by the comfortable plushness of velour and sparkling brightness of grand chandeliers.  The 17-course degustation opens with Osetra caviar served atop king crab and crustacean gelee and a gold flake. I felt this could be an appropriate amuse-bouche as the shellfish tasting note speaks for what was the tasting theme of tonight's prix fixe.  The first service is a trio of Scottish Salmon confit with more Osetra caviar and wasabi cream, Foie Gras with violet artichoke and Parmesan, and Beetroot and apple with young herbs with green mustard sorbet, the latter I felt worked in perfect harmony bringing in a refreshing balance to the richness of the other assemblages.  Second service is rather modest presenting an unassuming soft boiled egg on spinach puree with comte sauce, and frog leg fritters in garlic puree and parsley coulis. Not exactly a mesmerizing highlight of the prix fixe but it's certainly significant as an appreciated pause from the more intense dishes served thus far.  Third brings crustaceous tasting notes as foretold in the opening act of the night, with truffled lobster ravioli in fioe gras emulsion lightened with simmered cabbage, shrimp and tomato tartare in bouillabaise with turmeric tuile, and seared diver scallop with kumquat and caviar.  The seafood theme continues into the forth service with another trio of black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy, roasted turbot with artichokes in barigoule emusion, and lobster mariniere in coralline jus with seasonal vegetables. I felt the coralline added too much earthiness but perhaps this was Robuchon's curveball to break the otherwise predictable and rich flavors.  Before reaching the main course I surmised the use of foie gras would be curtailed, given the previous indulgences.  But I was wrong.  Main course is farm chicken and foie gras with Chateau Chalon, morels and simmered asparagus. It didn't quite feel like a culmination as some of the previous items I felt were more of the highlights of the degustation.  A trio of sweet and tarte amuse-bouche consists of Jasmine tea chantilly with pineapple and lemon confit, violet cream and yogurt sorbet and blueberry compote, and creamy hibiscus emulsion with apple granite. This orchestra leads to the finale of a praline ice cream with hazelnut milk chocolate cremeux with coffee chantilly, finished by French-pressed coffee with milk and artisan sugars.  At $1,200 for this tasting menu for 2 with wine, Robuchon will leave a memorable and lasting impression I'm sure is tough to beat, but oddly I felt the former 2-Michelin Star ALEX by Alessandro Stratta was a bigger winner in my personal book. But nevertheless Guy Savoy and Picasso has some catching up to do if they want to play in the same league as Joel.",

    "text": "Wow. Amazing and epic are the two words that come to mind when I think about the dinner I had here. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and lush and just beautiful. I especially love the comfy deep purple couches at the tables-just made the dining experience feel more cozy.   Can we talk about that bread cart? It's basically heaven on wheels. And even better, each piece of bread I had from the cart was so so so delicious. I mean I had to really conjure up the self control to not gorge on the bread. The bread was a standout of that meal for me because I'm a bread enthusiast and it was the best bread selection I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The appetizers and entrees were all excellent. I felt my piece of black cod was a little too salty, but it was still good. The desserts were of course delicious as well, but to be honest I was already stuffed silly by the time dessert arrived. They just LOOKED impressive, like incredible pieces of art. I never knew a dessert could look important.   And lastly, the service was top notch. Come to think of it, the entire service staff (minus the front host) was male. They were so polite and nice and each of them really knew their stuff. Also, if you've never been to the restaurant, the portions are not tiny. I was expecting small tiny portions because so many other fancy restaurants serve tiny bird-appropriate portions. We each ordered the two appetizers, two entrees menu and it was a bit too much. Especially given the bread cart and the dessert cart (this is on top of your actual dessert that's part of the tasting menu). I was uncomfortably full by the time we left.  They sent us off with a huge loaf of pound cake each. I ate it the next day, a delicious moist pistachio pound cake.   I expected this to be a stellar dining experience and it was just that. I'll be back again soon I hope!",

    "text": "We went here while in town for our 11th anniversary (we go to and eat out in Vegas a lot).  We are adventurous food eaters and enjoy a very good meal, but this is definitely an experience that we have never had before.   The hostess and all service people were on point and extremely polite, as you would expect in an establishment that is so formal.  One notable presence was Michael Rone, the Sommelier and Assistant Manager.  He was a welcome \"down to earth\" figure during our entire meal.  We tend not to take ourselves too seriously, so when we walked in, I was a bit disappointed that we had possibly made a mistake by scheduling what was sure to be a good four hour meal right in the middle of our Friday night where we might have usually gone to a fun sushi restaurant for an hour and then go to a bar or gambling.  Michael almost immediately eased my concerns shortly after we were sat in that regard.  I am not sure what I would have thought of the entire experience had he been off that night, to be honest.  We had read the reviews ahead of time and did not want to get stuffed, so we skipped the 17 mini-courses and opted for the 5 course meal (2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and one dessert each) and we added on the caviar and truffle supplements and both had the wine pairings and a separate cocktail.  Our check totaled at $1,226.00 BEFORE we added our tip.  It is not lost on me that we are fortunate to even have the ability to do that without thinking much about it, as people can purchase a used car for that, so the critique should be discerning, in my opinion.  Service - excellent, no suggestions there and recommend they give Michael a bonus, if anything.  Actually, the waiter that took our order...when asking for some direction on what the dishes would look or taste like, he did not really help us much; he picked about 75% of them and just reread what we already saw on the menu - not helpful.  Atmosphere - you either will like it or not...it is fancy, quiet, proper... not necessarily our jam, but certainly no complaints or suggestions from us here...they achieved what they are going for.  Wine Pairings - Michael did an excellent job of reading us, our tastes, and the experience we were hoping for ...and he delivered.  While I cannot say that we loved all the wines, I can emphatically say that Michael took care of us and made our evening more enjoyable and fun.  He gave us each a bonus tasting of a vintage single cellar wine and the pours were all very generous.  Glad we opted for this (we almost did not) and we left with no regrets there.  Food - this is the one area that we both agreed could use some help, again, especially for the price.  There were dishes and aspects we LOVED and wowed over and there were areas that we felt they fell short or were just very ordinary (besides the plating, which was ALWAYS excellent).  The bread cart and after dessert cart were an awesome touch - unlimited variety...more restaurants should incorporate this!  Definitely pace yourself and save room for both.  The actual desserts were nothing short of stunning.  Lingering impressions: get the miso fish entree dish - AMAZING. Get \"The Sphere\" dessert - truly felt bad eating it as it was so pretty and equally delicious.  Skip the beef cheeks and the sea bass entrees - meh.  The rest of the dishes were very pretty and tasty enough...but I would hope to be wowed at the price you pay.  They also made and brought us out a separate ice cream cake for our anniversary and sent us on our way with a bread loaf of some kind (that we did not get to even try, but hope the maid from our hotel loved).  I also gave a ring that I had made for my husband for his anniversary gift to one of the waitresses and she had the chef incorporate it into a dessert for my husband.  So.. overall, great experience.  Michael and the plating really made it so.  We did it once, likely would not go back due to value, UNLESS we had friends that wanted to really go there...then we would, but I would get an even smaller tasting menu.  We were full after the appetizers and stuffed after the first entree and could not finish everything, even though we are both definitely big eaters.  I would ask to be sat in one of the four corner booths...we loved that as we could see the whole space and all the other diners.  Some of the tables would have been a far less enjoyable experience.  I would not want to be sat on \"The Terrace,\" as an example.",

Seriously one of my favorite things about this place was the ambience. It's beautifully decorated inside and that adds to the experience overall. I had a couch seat next to the fireplace with lush purple velvet pillows. Damn I felt fancy.   Service was good, almost great but not fantastic. The sommelier was a highlight though of the service; no problems there. As far as food, it was beautifully presented but is being out-done by others (Atelier Crenn comes to mind..). Quality of the dishes were magnificent but seemed a bit heavy on items with foie gras and gelatinous textures. A little more variety and balance could serve them well.   Overall a tremendous experience. If you have the means and the fortitude (that bill was steep once you add the top level wine pairing - even for a 3-star), you should make the effort to go!",

    "text": "Since college, I've walked by this restaurant only to dream of one day dining at a three-star Michelin restaurant. My dreams came to fruition last night when my girlfriend took me for my birthday. Joel Robuchon is a name that is almost synonymous with Michelin Guide stars. In fact, in total, his restaurants have garnered more stars combined than any other chef in the world. The limiting factor of trying his food has always been a huge price point, which still holds True at this location. However, in addition to the 17 course degustation menu, there are several other options including mix and match menus for: $250, $198, $169, and $127.   After much consideration, we both opted for the $198 tasting menu, which included an amuse bouche, two appetizers, one main course, one dessert, and ending sweets. The interior was well-lit, and felt quite exclusive, like the inside of a luxurious penthouse dining room. One of the most unique aspects of dining here is the bread cart, which has way too many options of breads to choose from. Some of the highlights were the bacon, basil, cheese, and mini croissants. You could choose as many options as you wanted, and they would be taken back and heated before being served. Butter for the bread is shaved from a giant block of butter, topped with sea salt and served along side olive oil.  Our first amuse bouche was a daikon puree, Ossetra caviar over creme fraiche , daikon, and gelee. It was chilled, light, and a refreshing start to dinner. After that, dinner became a blur with one appetizer after another. Appetizers included the Le Homard du Maine (Maine lobster in thin sliced daikon with black truffle coulis), La Chataigne (light chestnut veloute on celeriac flan with cardamon and bacon), La Langoustine (truffled langoustine ravioli served with simmered cabbage and foie gras sauce), and Le Foie Gras (Millefeuille of winter vegetables and foie gras in thin pasta layers, truffle infused poultry bouillon). For the supplementary $35, the La Langoustine was my favorite of the bunch. The aroma was very earthy and the langoustine and foie gras married quite well together. I enjoyed the chestnut dish best next, followed by the Maine lobster and the foie gras. I was a little disappointed by the lack of the bold and rich flavor that is expected from foie gras, especially when it should be the star of the dish.   For our main courses, we tried the grilled beef ribeye with foie gras and mushroom ravioli, and the Le Saint-Pierre (John Dory fish fillet with tempura of green shiso leaf over squid ink risotto). While the beef was well-cooked, the salt and peppercorn taste was bit overwhelming. The mushroom ravioli with foie gras was exceptional. As for the fish, I loved the crunch from the tempura paired together with the nice fish filet and the creamy risotto.   At this point, I was pretty satisfied, but dessert remained, not to mention the sweets cart at the end. For dessert, we tried the La Sphere (bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberry yogurt sorbet, candied lemon and a violet cream), and the La Parfum des Iles (caramelized banana and passion fruit cream, aged Rum granite and coconut foam). The bubble sugar sphere dessert is a work of art. It resembles a Faberge egg, almost too beautiful to break and eat. After all that, they presented me a birthday cake on top of the sweets cart where we were able to pick unlimited numerous small bites.   By the end of dinner, I was very full and couldn't eat one more bite of dessert. I was happy that we chose the $198 tasting menu as the portions of the main courses were larger than the full degustation menu at half the price. Although most of the dishes last night were exceptional, I thought that if it were to be ranked again, I'm not sure if it would keep its third Michelin star. The waiters rarely came to refill our water, they never swept the crumbs from our table, and not to mention the over-seasoned steak. That isn't to say that this wasn't an elegant dining experience.",

Having said that, it was good, but not the life-altering experience I expected and frankly, felt I deserved when I got the bill.  It's not worth doing a blow-by-blow recap since the menu probably changes seasonally.  You get a choice of four prix fixe options and they'll work with you to do substitutions if, for example, you don't want the soup, but would rather finish up with the cheese trolley.    Some highlights: the bread trolley was amazing with over a dozen varieties.  Service was nearly perfect.  Fairly small, contemporary and elegant dining room that is a surprising oasis of calm just outside the cacophony of the MGM casino.  Wine selection was good and while overpriced, at least not insultingly so.  Our courses ranged from ok, to amazing.  And I guess that's what I'm objecting to: at this price level, ok is not acceptable.",

My husband got us a private limo that dropped us off at the private entrance of the Mansion where high rollers and celebrities get dropped off and there was a hostess who was already waiting for us at the gate, and walked us through the lovely Mansion and the lovely garden they had.   I had the 4 course and my husband had the 6 course which was still too much food for us. They had something like 16 different types of breads to chose from and a great selection of wines and cheeses. I paid extra for a truffle soup and it was orgasmic! It was the right amount of earthiness and the dumplings were melt in your mouth delicious! I would give anything to have that again. Our servers were absolutely delightful to have and it was extremely nice of them to give us the outdoor patio/garden all to ourselves for dinner.  Needless to say, I would definitely come back.   In my opinion, it was MUCH BETTER than Cyrus. No food poisoning here!  We also got the same driver who drove us to Joel Robuchon and he told us we missed Paris Hilton by 3 minutes which was a bummer, but we definitely enjoyed taking photos instead.

I chose the $168 pre-fix menu which included: - the standard caviar and crab melody amuse buche. I like caviar and crab, I felt very special eating this first.  - soup: a light green pea and bacon cream with a hint of peppermint and sweet onion cloud. This was very tasty indeed. I would have licked the cup if I could but it would have been highly inappropriate.  -salad: king crab touched with indian curry, avocado, romaine lettuce in a coral virgin olive oil and some kind of creamy vingarette. this looked pretty but the taste of Indian curry was too strong for me - main course: spiny lobster poached in a sea urchin boullion  with radish shaving and nori. this would have been perfect had it not smelt so damn fishy. -dessert: pistachio creme brulee, raspberry infused with an apperitif wine, rose sabayon with freeze dried raspberries and a raspberry sorbet topped with pistachio brittle. I loved this dessert. I didn't think raspberries were too overwhelming.   the highlights of this experience hardly had anything to do with the actual meals. What impressed me the most was:  - Le pain cart: first of all, I think it is odd that the french word for bread is spelled \"P-A-I-N\", because I feel that too much bread can hurt your stomach.  The selection was Gynormous,  It was like a United French bread conference where almost every type of french bread was represented, from the tiny cheese brioche to the long sour dough baguette. They also had this pinwheel roll made up puff pastry and olive oil that was to die for.  What was equally important to note is the \"BIG @$$\" brick of butter in a glass case. It is so big, this brick of butter needs it's own cart. I'm wondering how many frenchmen it took to churn this large block of butter or did they just find some overgrown magic bovine to lay this huge butter egg? Once you select your bread, the server will wheel in the butter brick cart and  hand curl your serving of butter with a warm spoon. the server will then sprinkle a few droplets of sea salt granules on top of the butter.   Finally there are the mignardises also known as the tiny bite size desserts served after the dessert. weird, but this too deserves its own cart. The cart is filled head to toe with petite fours, handmade marshmallows, tuilles, brittles, meringues, macarons,  macaroons, caramels, gels, frail lollipops and various truffles. the wait staff doesn't mind you being a piggy",

    "text": "One of the best meals of my life and I've eaten at some of the world's greatest restaurants, including Guy Savoy in Paris, French Laundry, Gary Danko etc...  We were picked up in their gold limo at our hotel and whisked to their private entrance at The Mansion.  Wow, talk about lifestyles of the rich and famous - the Mansion is MGM's super exclusive and secretive high roller hotel, not open to the public and with only 22 suites.  It literally feels like you're in a different world, like a Four Seasons on steroids.    We were seated in the adjunct room at  Robuchon which I didn't mind a bit, unlike other reviewers.  I felt that it was super private, the room smelled like wonderful flowers and the service was ever attentive.  We opted to go with the 16-course tasting menu with high-end wine pairing.  I opted for the vegetarian option.  The sommalier was super friendly and asked us what we liked first, whereupon he went off and opened wines just for our dinner.  The vegetarian menu was wonderful, often restaurants treat these as an afterthought, but someone had definitely paid attention to what they were doing.  The server told us they only get 2-3 such requests a month, so for them to always have this on hand is impressive.  Service was impeccable, each dish was like a work of art.  The wines were simply amazing and creative, especially the Chave Hermitage Blanc '04.  This dinner will stay with us for a long time...",

    "text": "It pains me to say but (for me at least) this was simply not all it's cracked up to be.  Maybe I'm too gourmand, or expectations were too high, or maybe I just don't love the French-ness... I don't know. I really wanted to be thrilled here, but was mostly only amused, and my taste buds were often a bit confused.  So yes, it's kinda fun, interesting, and certainly delivers some dishes -- visually, texturally, and in flavor -- you've had nowhere else. The service is spectacularly buttoned up. The decor looks (as someone else wrote more perfectly) like they raided Elton John's wardrobe for curtains.  It is very interesting. So it's hard to say you shouldn't give it a look. But for straight up flavor, amazing taste -- no, it's nowhere near my favorite. And I don't think it was simply that I don't \"get it\"... though several clams later, I admit I'm not sure I do.  Our favorite dishes were: 1. The green soup (there has since been some detailed disagreement whether this was in-season pea or fava bean as the take-home guide suggests; we could swear it was pea) with onion foam. It was fabulous and addictive.  2. The amuse-bouche of caviar on fennel cream. Very cool. Clearly a signature dish. 3. The \"caprese\" gelee, which was simply so detailed and interesting. Though it had much more play value than spectacular flavor I thought. But very cool nonetheless.  The other amazing part was the cheese service, but it's hard to give such a restaurant too much props for this -- I would also give 5 stars on cheese to my favorite warehouse in NoHo.  On the down side, we had two dishes we found borderline unpleasant -- a tofu & eel dish that seemed fishy, and a lobster dish where the lobster was a bit rubbery. Might have been intended or not, I'm not sure. But not spectacular, and that was the goal.  Beyond that, my only caution is that yes, my friends, you can order too much food. After all the reviews, we thought 7 courses would be a light, fun trip -- it was easily 1-2 courses too many. At any normal restaurant you ce-la-vie I suppose, but pushing away food at this price (and quality?) feels a little painful somehow.  Every adventurer finds a dead end occasionally, and it was still fun searching. So no love lost, the conversation were company was exceptional, and we'll be back at the search again tomorrow.",

    "text": "This is one of the 2 best meals of my life (I'd give it 10 stars if I could).   Been here twice for an 8 course tasting menu in the tasting room. The tasting room decor is dark, intimate and fantastic, but you're only getting in there if you go with a big group, which I highly recommend. I also recommend getting there a little early before your meal so you can enjoy a drink in the lounge--it's like being in a friend's very fancy, yet very comfortable, parlor.  The food cannot be described as anything other than pure perfection. The taste, the presentation, the service, it is all exquisite. Trying to select the best dish of the meal is like trying to pick your favorite child. But if I had to choose, the 1st course caviar with crab meat and fennel cream would be the first-born, medical school-bound, 3 sport athlete son of the group.  The Michelin guide got it right, this place is absolutely deserving of that exclusive 3rd star.  PS: apparently yelp etiquette dictates that I add my lifetime Michelin star count?  In that case, Joel Robuchon = Michelin stars: 13-15 & 27-29 for me.  (I'm not being sarcastic, this is actually a great thing to keep track of...I'm going to put them all in a chart on my tombstone.)",

    "text": "Since moving to Las Vegas have wanted to try this restaurant--have heard many good things and it has a three star Michelin rating.  Was able to dine here on Monday, decided to go with the full 16 course dinner with wine pairing.  The overall atmosphere was very elegant, had a table on the \"patio\" which had the live plant terraces and had the feeling of being outside, very enjoyable.  The staff seemed very educated on the dinner and the sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable about the wines.  The restaurant has a very nice selection of wines.  The 16 course dinner was prepared nicely overall, had several intricate details for decoration and most of the courses were delicious.  Only noticed a few areas that were not up to the three star standard--the seared scallop with lemongrass, broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked with risotto was not seared, was poached and was a little overdone--somewhat rubbery.  The duo of duck breast and foie gras was also overcooked--rubbery--and did not have a crispy outside skin.  The caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy was fabulous--very well prepared, flakey, moist, and very full of flavor.  My overall rating of this restaurant is very very good, I definitely enjoyed the meal and the experience--the service was fantastic and the food was a marvel to see as well as to eat.  I would say it is an experience to dine here, somewhat pricey but overall I believe it is worth the three stars from Michelin.                              My courses consisted of:   Assortment of freshly made breads from the bread trolley Sea urchin on delicate beef gelee and carrot velvet cream Violet artichoke and foie gras salad with parmesan shavings Osetra caviar with salmon tartare Asparagus in a turmeric vinaigrette, king crab on crustacean gelee Semi-soft boiled egg Florentine with Comte cheese sauce Seared scallop with lemongrass, broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto Thin veloute of porcini mushrooms with a jasmine rice cream Crispy Matsu take and foie gras ravioli Veal raviolis cooked in broth and white truffle Roasted spiny lobster with green curry and fresh coriander Caramelized black cod in Malabar pepper sauce with bok choy Duo of duck breast and foie gras, five spice sweet and sour grapes with ginger Coconut lime parfait topped with elderflower liqueur gelee and compressed pineapple Caramelized vanilla apples tarte tatin with calvados ice cream Assorted sweets from the sweet trolley                          The sommelier's wine pairings: Chablis Grand Cru, Vaudesirs, Domaine William Fevre, Burgundy 2008 Riesling Grand Cru Schlossberg, Cuvee Saint Catherine, Domaine Weinbach, Alsace 2012 Beaune 1st Cru Clos de Mouches, Domaine Joseph Drouhin, Burgundy 2008 Morey-Saint-Denis 1st Cru, Clos des Ormes, Domaine Lecheneaut, Burgundy 2007 Chateau Leoville-Las Cases, Saint-Julien, Bordeaux 2002 Selection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris, Domaine Zind-Humbrecht, Alsace 2007",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I missed out on the limo experience because I was staying at the MGM Grand. It's kind of obvious from everyone else's experiences that it's mostly excellent, so I'll just mention what went wrong.  I don't think this a quirk of French cuisine -- our food was all oversalted. We didn't dare ask for any dishes to be corrected because of some... communication issues.  Here goes: are the waiters' French accents real? If so, why could they not understand ANYTHING I ordered? I'm no expert on the language but I studied it in school for 5 years, and I'd like to think I can say the names of dishes clearly enough to be understood in an American restaurant. (And this only happened to me, not to either of my dining companions.) I kept being asked to repeat what I said, and then they would repeat after me... still pronouncing it exactly the same way. What gives? Tremendously frustrating, and a bit of a sticking point on the otherwise great service.  PS: the dress code doesn't formally require jackets, but you'll probably be more comfortable if you wear one, unless you're already so rich and important that you don't need to consult things like dress codes when you go out.",

    "text": "My 50th review.  Yay.  Had the 16 course tasting meal.  One of the best meals of my life.    I can see how the decor is kind of love it or hate it.  I loved it.  Excellent service.  The GM came over and had a 15 minute conversation with us.  He then came back to take our order.  Very classy.  After the meal he gave us a very un-rushed kitchen tour.  Throughout the rest of the meal we received incredible service.    I didn't realize that this is the flagship restaurant in the U.S.  It's Robuchon's only fine dining restaurant in North America.  Other two are in Tokyo and Macao.  The Asian influence was apparent throughout the meal.  First they bring out the bread cart.  She rattled off like 20 different types of bread then took a deep breath and pointed at the shelf below and rattled off another 6 or 7.  Wow.  Baking done in house.  We tried 9-10 different types of bread - everything great - my fav was the saffron brioche.    The plating of the dishes was beautiful and creative. Every plate was custom made to go with the dish.  The plates also go with the decor.  This was the most visually appealing dining experience I've ever had anywhere.  The starter was Osetra caviar over three kinds of crab.  This was amazing but I'll take Keller's oysters and pearls over this.  The plating though was extremely creative - served in a tin on an engraved plaque.  Next course was coriander soup with deep fried cilantro and a bruchetta.  I have a little bit of a problem with deconstructed dishes.  I think it's because I'm an idiot.  I never know what to eat first or what to dip in what.  The coriander soup was delicious but a little too plentiful to be just drinking it straight.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to put the fried ciliantro in there and then dip the bruchetta or what.  Still it was a lovely dish and a nice way to open up the palete.  The next dish was one of my favs.  Perfectly cooked scallop in ginger/leek broth.    Next was the frog leg.  Wow.  Probably my fav course.  I wish I could take like a dozen of these things to go.  One of the best dishes I've had anywhere in my life.  Bursting with flavor and umami goodness.  Next was another one of these deconstructed dishes.  One plate had cooked uni over spiced spinach.  I didn't like the uni.  I know uni is out of season right now, but I've had some excellent uni (cooked and raw) in the last couple of weeks.  Also part of this course was lemongrass roasted lobster - decent.  And finally, was a langostine ball in some curry tea.  That was awesome - bursting with flavor.  Reminded me of a shrimp ball you'd find in saimin - the best \"shrimp ball\" I've ever had.  Next was like a pea puree poured into an onion foam.  I was skeptical when I saw this but wow - it was yum.  One of my fav courses.  Next was sea bass which unfortunately was way overcooked and underseasoned.  This was perhaps the only blemish on the meal.  Next was sliced foie gras in cabbage ravioli.  Excellent dish - although it is a different experience than eating seared foie gras that melts in your mouth.  Also the cabbage was a little chewy and difficult to cut and I kind of choked on it a little.  Next was a deconstructed trio of Kobe beef.  First was ribeye stuffed with carrot and also on that plate was heart of palm stuffed with bone marrow.  NOTE:  EAT A PIECE OF THE RIBEYE AND ONE OF THE MARROW/PALMS IN ONE BITE - much more synergy than eating separately as the marrow explodes in your mouth and complements the meat.  Also was Kobe cheek over silky mashed potatoes.  Definitely best cow cheek I've had.  And finally was a covered bowl of stew that was uncovered by the server when you were ready to eat it.  Very creative and delicious.  Finishing off the savory courses was some spring root vegetables over couscous served in a tangine (nice touch).  Probably best couscous  I've ever had.  Very fresh tasting green beans.  The desert courses started with picturesque fruit soup served with flowers.  Then a desert tray with as many choices of ganaches, candies and chocolates as the bread cart.  And finally your choice of multiple types of yummy sorbet.    In spite of an off dish or two, everything else was so next-level that I can comfortably say this is one of the best meals I've eaten in my life and without a doubt the best restaurant in Vegas.  Worth every penny - actually for $500/man I say it's a steal.  I can't wait to go back.",

There's hardly anything I can say that hasn't been said in previous reviews so I will refrain from repeating what's already been said.   My only word of advice to anyone who is considering eating  here is...dress the part.   It's easy to dress a little more casual in Vegas. These days, you can see a show in jeans and eat at five-star restaurants. But the decor and the hushed ambiance of Robuchon put us on our best behavior.   So take this opportunity to dress up. And guys, stop the grumbling. The meal is worth it and you can lose the jacket and tie when you hit the casino floor.",

    "text": "Let me get just one thing straight.  I am willing to shell out for something good. For something pretty delicious. When I heard about the $360 price tag for a 13 course meal (yeah... that's right bitches. 13 courses - not 16 like I was expecting - and yeah - that pricetag is without wine), I'll admit that I balked. I was hesitant. But hey, if it makes my tastebuds sing - I'm all willing to give it a try.  Let me tell you the context - my bf got a big pay raise so he really wanted to go there - hey! what's life if you don't splurge every once in a while.  Anyway, we head over to the MGM and yeah, I was wowed. Wow'd by the beautiful chandelier, the plush cushions in the booth seats, the french linens.  Nothing could really prepare me for such a big diappointment.   First things first - they refuse to give you tap water. They say that they only serve bottled water and you have a choice - fizzy or non-fizzy. And this is at $10 a bottle. Not to mention the server practically jumps to refill your glass after you've taken only 1 sip. Just adding to the $360 tab.  As I was contemplating going to the bathroom for a drink of water (from the sink!), they brought a nice palate cleanser - a berry granite  with a citrus foam which was served over dry ice to keep it perfectly cool. Unfortunately it went down hill from there.  Basicially, after the next three dishes - tomato/coriander/caviar were a great disappointment. Okay the tomato was served with a tomato gelee. The coriander was served as a foam/gelee thing. Caviar three ways was some sort of gelee/foam thing.  By this point, my bf and I was looking at each other thinking - does this guy do something other than fancy jello and foam? My boyfriend leaned over and whispered in my ear - \"What's your favorite dish so far?\" My answer: \"the bread cart\" (an impressive 16+ selection of brioche/baguettes). My bf basically agreed. Sad, isn't it?  Okay, from there things get a little better. A really good egg ravioli - delicious. A decadent sea urchin flan, a delectable shrimp tea and a subpar lobster bonbon - comprised a shellfish dish. A decent turbot, an okay salmon - nothing too impressive. The Japanese Kobe Beef was pretty good but I've had better preparations of Kobe beef  before. A soybean risotto - fair but nothing to shout home about.  There was an interesting margarita - frozen yogurt with effervescent sugar. A yummy herb sorbet (mint flavored primarily).   Because it was my bf's b-day, they wheeled out a meringue/ice cream cake with raspberry sorbet. It was beautiful however they gave us only two slivers of the cake and then wheeled the rest away. We're still wondering what happened to the rest of the cake.   Then came the mignardises - the impressive cart of petit fours that number at least over 30+ served with coffee or tea. (By the way, being Chinese - they had crappy white tea - just a few sprigs sprinkled in to give the water some color).  A sad thing was I asked our server which one of the petit fours were her favorite - she mentioned she'd only tried one. Normally, if you are a server especially at a fancy restaurant like this, you have a good idea what your clientele is eating. Heck even in the lower end restaurants - the same thing. But here, obviously not so.  So that's it - we got a lemon loaf on our way out for the next day, copies of the menu accompanied by a sense of feeling like we'd been ripped off.   Yes, the presentation of the food was beautifully done and I was impressed. However unique presentation or innovation does not necessarily mean that it will taste very good.  And the pricetag - given the ingredients that were used - is wholly not justified. Other than the caviar/Norweigan salmon (tasteless by the way)/kobe beef there wasn't any ingredient that was really expensive.  Because of that, I'm giving Joel Robuchon a big two stars - one for the bread cart, one for the petit fours which were the highlight of the visit. Honestly - to truly enjoy maybe 6 of 13 courses and pay $900+ for two people - that's a little too much.",

There is a bit of a feeling like it's all been done a million times and is a bit factory-ish, but it's still shockingly good and I defy someone to say otherwise. Imaginative, beautifully presented, well-executed and thoughtful.   The staff was not very considerate to a solo diner and were quite cold, infact. I did not feel my every need was anticipated, and was somewhat overlooked in fact. I returned from the rest room and had to struggle with the heavy table to let myself back onto the banquette. My tea did not come with cream or sugar, I had to ask. I was never offered more bread after the bread cart made it's cursory beginning of the meal rounds. Am I just a timid diner? Perhaps.   I was left wanting at the end of my evening, and that is not how I want to feel after dropping a few bills on dinner. I remain undecided, overall. Maybe I was tapped out on French food or high end restaurants. Maybe I set the bar too high. Perhaps if I had not been a solo diner my experience would have been different.  I found the service mostly mechanical, lacking passion and excitement. Le Cirque and Guy Savoy made me want to go back to experience both the food AND service again. They were both delightful, surprising and joyful to eat at, and I got the feeling that they wanted you to experience everything and try everything. Joel Robuchon left me wanting...it kind of felt soulless, actually.",

    "text": "I was expecting to leave Joel Robuchon a changed person.  Okay maybe not, but I was expecting to have one of the best meals, if not the best, in my life.  I thoroughly enjoyed the olive oil, cheese, and bacon varieties of bread I chose from the massive bread cart.  The caviar with crab and fennel cream was an awesome way to start my 16 course tasting menu.  I usually don't like cold foie, but the second dish changed my opinion.  Thinly curled pieces of foie gras terrine, shaved black truffle, and soft potatoes melted in my mouth.  The rich flavors with a little bit of radish & coarse black pepper made me moan with delight.  At this point, I was thinking The French Laundry was in trouble of losing its top spot on my all time favorites.  The third course actually had a trio of truffles.  One was a mushroom consume with a veal stuffed mushroom, topped with black truffles.  The second was a black truffle tart with onion confit, and third offering was an egg custard with golden toast and more truffles.  I'm telling you, this one trio had more truffles than I had eaten in my whole life.  For some reason at this point, my service dropped off dramatically.  My next course was brought out while I was still enjoying my truffles.  Pacing was too fast, and I did not get a chance to breathe in between the rest of my courses.  At one point, I also had to pour my own water.  Come on, this should not be the case at a 3 star restaurant where I am paying nearly $500 for a world-class dining experience.  I really enjoyed the crustacean trio, pumpkin and ginger soup, and the farrow risotto, but there were a few dishes I did not enjoy.  That's not unusual for a tasting menu, and overall, I thought the food itself was rich, beautiful, and decadent. Just when I thought I finished with the chocolate dessert, another cart filled with les mignardises drove by.  I was so full at this point, but I did choose a variety of dark chocolate treats to take with me.  I left with a bar of Joel Robuchon chocolate, a high gloss picture album of the restaurant, and a slightly disappointed feeling.  I'm glad I tried Joel Robuchon, as most of my meal was extremely delicious.  However, for the price and disappointing service, I would not recommend this restaurant to others.  The French Laundry remains number one in my book.",

Loved that there were many types of breads and desserts that we were able to sample because they were presented to us on a cart that was being pushed around. The crab royale salad was good, but the foie gras appetizer was probably the best I've ever had. Everything else was delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with anything there, but definitely order the foie gras. The intimate atmosphere was a nice change of pace and scenery from everything in Vegas, especially because we sat in the fake outdoor veranda.",

It is quite an experience. so unlike any other Vegas restaurant Ive been: tiny, dark, quiet,very anticlimactic with MGM or any other casino. Servers were very friendly and polite, and they provide valuable advice to customers.   I don't know if I will be back. I hope so!! Two friends of mine -couple- actually went for the degustation menu. With wine and tip they paid over 1k. Makes you wonder at what point is just too much for food. Later I learned that my veal had a masters degree in some east coast university. Maybe it was worth it.",

I am certain Mr. Robuchon is not cooking in the back.  As a French person born and raised on this cuisine...i can ascertain that this is not the cuisine culture I experienced growing up. However this is not important...great chefs leave their mark regardless of whether or not they are not in the kitchen. The food was not horrible but extremely average.  This restaurant is for people who are not familiar with good cuisine who feel the need to flush dollars down the toilet.",

We started our evening off with a complimentary limo ride which picks you up anywhere in Vegas and was dropped off through the back entrance of the MGM mansions. A place I never knew existed. We waited for our gracious host to show up while taking pictures and posting on social media.  A 16 course menu for both of us. I enjoyed their gin and tonic which is out of this world.  Take the sommelier's suggestion on French wines. Wonderful service and food. Highly recommend",

My recent visit was the most spectacular, and I sat inside in the dining room, rather than outside this time. I also have to say that this place is the most stunningly beautiful restaurant ever. The tables are lavish, the seats are deep purple and velvet, the art is stunning, but the most special part of the restaurant is the chandelier. They hang it in the middle of the room for obvious reasons ;). It's literally breathtaking.   Aside from the mind-blowingly gorgeous decor, the food is superb as well. We did the 16 course tasting menu and I loved every bit of it, especially the caviar course. As great as the tasting menu is, the two most special parts of the evening are the bread cart and the mignardises cart. I have never seen a restaurant pay so much attention to detail like JR. You can choose from 40 different breads that are heated up for you personally, and you can choose as many sweets off the cart as you like! Heavenly. We also had a great wine pairing as well.   Our servers were outstanding, the decor is as gorgeous as I remembered, and the food was superb. There is no competition to JR and it will continue to be my favorite restaurant. I wish I could come back more often, and I really want to take the gold limo next time I go!",

Be careful of supplemental fees they add on for certain things, they add up quick. Was a great experience but probably wouldn't come back bc of the price. The 5 course menu took almost 3 hours so plan accordingly if you are going to watch a show afterwords. The couple next to us had a show to go to do had to rush.

Rather, the presentation (platter, bowls, and decoration) was a mix of enchanting forest meets modern art. And yes, I totally think that some of the decorative pieces were from Hobby Lobby or Michael's!   Exquisite.   TIPS:  - Make a reservation.  Duh. - You might be able to get the complimentary limo ride through MGM but the cut off time for that is 8:30pm reservation and for the month of April, MGM cut off their limo privileges.  - Don't overeat the bread (like I did). You will be full. Come hungry. - Better love foie gras cuz there's a lot of it in this season's menu.",

    "text": "Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too.   Short Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service.   Long Review: Here's what we ordered:  1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it. 1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.  2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable. 2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable.   3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.) 3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, \"Next time, don't take so long to take photos.\" WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.  Than came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served.    4A) Roasted duck...Okay. 4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average.   The Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.    5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course.   6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware.  6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?  Than while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.  At the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could.   Verdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere.",

    "text": "The food was excellent, this is not a rating on the food as it would be 5 star. This is a rating on the overall experience which got off to a very bad start. Let's face it... with a dinner tab for two of $1,500 this is not a everyday experience and thus expectations are much higher than your average high end restaurant, rightfully so.  I believe expectations are set by your price tag, and just because there is a high price tag doesn't mean you have the right be act or be pretentious. I have the pleasure of knowing many Ultra-Weathly people who won't and don't visit or frequent this type of establishment, I'm a foodie so it was a must visit for me.  Do to the limited seating and the intimate setting, reservations are sometimes hard to come by. I contacted the restaurant directly and I was told they where 4 weeks out on reservations. Although, I spend a lot of time in Vegas, planning 4 weeks out for a dinner is not on my priority list. Instead of trying to plan that far in advance for a dinner, I opted to contact my MGM Host instead, he promptly returned my call and informed me he had arranged for a 5:30 dinner reservation.  I personally think it is rude to show up late for an appointment or reservation, I don't believe in fashionably late, so I arrived at 5:20. I could see the staff and the hostess who was not at her station (granted the official open time is 5:30) you would think there would be some consideration that some guests like to show up a few minutes early. It took 5 minutes before the hostess recognized we had been waiting at her station, at that point it wasn't even a warm friendly greeting... it was a \"Can I help you?\" I said good evening, we have a 5:30 reservation for 2, she didn't miss a beat in her total disregard for the guests... quickly and rudely stating we open at 5:30 at which point I said, Ohh I'm sorry it is only 5:25 and the door was open so I assumed you were already seating. She again didn't miss a beat and said no, we don't begin seating till 5:30, please wait outside till then.  Most people wouldn't tolerate that attitude in a $$ restaurant and here I was tolerating it in a $$$$ restaurant, my wife at that point wanted to just leave. My respect for my Host and that he went out of his way to get the reservation is the only thing that made me wait the 5 minutes.",

It was actually my birthday and the restaurant had prepared a gorgeous cake for me (enough for 6 or 7 people size).  The second night i went alone (cheaper....actually to be honest my sister and mom had already gone back to the lone star state)...again amazing everything.  the DUCK. the best i have had in my life...and i tell you - i have done duck all over the world in a variety ....  The managing director, bernard claeys (sp?) is great...so professional. In fact i think maybe I had seen him in tokyo at another fancy restaurant (taillevent)  many years ago where he was the managing director.  next time when i go back to vegas, i plan on going to joel robuchon every night but order their smallest menu and ask for some variations...the duck, oh the DUCK.",

We made reservations a few weeks ahead of time for a Sunday a few days after our anniversary. We were seated right away and asked if we wanted the sparkling bottled water or if we wanted the tap water. I hope I live long enough to see gourmet restaurants cutting this nickel and dime crap. I really bothers me that they feel the need to pressure you into spending $10 a glass for bottled water. OK rant over.  Everything in the room as far as decor was perfect, I was expecting the loud purple curtains and wallpaper but they are gone. The music was classical and at the perfect level.  Service was attentive but not perfect, crumbs did not get removed until we got desert. We did not receive a copy of the menu in our gift bag. When my wife got up to use the bathroom she had to wander around a bit to find out where they were.  We both ordered the $198 menu with two appetizers, one main, and one desert. Right off the bat the waiter and wine steward seemed just a little off when we did not order the 16 course meals with wine pairings. We ordered 1/2 bottle of white for the appetizers and each a glass of red for the main. The wine steward ran off before we could talk about desert wines and we never saw him again.  I ordered Le Caviar Imperial and it was very good and just salty enough to not be overwhelming. The thin crackers fell apart and were nearly impossible to use for eating the caviar. My wife got the white asparagus which was perfect.  For hot appetizers I had La Langoustine, I took another reviewers advice and made sure to get a piece of saffron bread to go with it. This was one of the best appetizers I have ever had, the foie gras emulsion was sublime. Wine got the lobster which again was perfect.  For the main course my wife opted for the black Cod which was perfectly cooked. I settled for the grilled beef ribeye, it was probably the best beef dish I have ever had. It was ordered medium rare and came out bright red all the way thru yet was perfectly cooked. It was truly memorable and melted in my mouth. I say I settled because I was prepared to order the duck  with foie gras but it was not on the menu. I could not understand why as they listed it on the 16 course menu for that same day and had a whole duck option for two people but my wife hates foie gras.   For desert I got the vanilla globe, which was ok and got tiresome after the first bite. Her black forest cake was a work of art and I loved the one bite she let me steal.  I felt the bread cart and the mignardises were both overkill and were a little out of place at a 3 star restaurant. The tiny pieces of bread cool off very fast and they lose something if you don't eat them warm.The sweets were attractive but did not really stand out.   The presentation of every single dish, even the freebies, was a work of art. One amuse was topped with caviar but the waiter talked to softly I could not hear the description. The first amuse was also unknown but the taste and texture of both was outstanding. I think that we would have been really stuffed if we opted for the 16 course meal or the $250 meal with two mains.   With tip we spent just under $1,000 and never at any time did I feel we were not getting our moneys worth. Except for the first two courses we never felt we were being rushed. The servers explained every dish, although it was hard to hear them. We will definitely be back again and hopefully Le Canard will be available as a main course.",

    "text": "To this day, I still consider this the best meal of my life.  Truly 5 Stars all around in ambiance, service, taste, execution and more. Considered the top 10 most expensive tasting menus in the world, definitely worth the hefty price tag.    We were picked up by a gold limo from our hotel.  They took us through the back of the MGM Grand Mansion.  It's a beautiful experience with an indoor courtyard.    First thing to mention is that any fine establishment not only has an amazing head chef but should have an amazing pastry chef.  JR did just that, the bread cart had over 30 choices of bread... I was in shock.  Usually having more than 6 choices is considered more than adequate, but here... you could choose your hearts desire.    This meal took over 4 hours and I was so full I couldn't breathe.  We had the 16 course tasting menu and every single dish was artistically plated with beautiful white and black truffles.  Ah I can still remember the aroma.  They also had a dessert cart with so many choices it was almost overwhelming.  (Posted Pictures of the legendary bread cart and dessert cart)",

Probably one of the top 5 meals that I've had in my life, and that is saying a lot.  It is actually quite an intimate dining experience and everything (food, service, wine pairings, etc) was superb.    Obviously, the final bill at the end is the only \"negative\", but that it is to be expected for an establishment of this quality.  Highly recommend this experience!",

    "text": "four stars because it really could have been a better experience. maybe it's my fault for anticipating this experience with such enthusiasm in the weeks leading up to the meal.  the evening started out wonderfully. we took advantage of the free limo and a hostess met us when the limo arrived, and walked us to the restaurant entrance. the dining room is gorgeous, the decor is muted but with a subtle elegance.  we wanted to bring wine (I'm a collector) but the corkage is $100 per bottle and the wine list prices are insane, so we opted for cocktails. not that you'd be bargain hunting if you're dining here, but the cocktails are a good deal. the speciality drinks were $22 and a premium vodka martini was $14 (although both were pretty small)  we opted for the $250 tasting menu (two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert) which was the right amount of food for us. but be aware that many of the items had supplemental pricing. for example an appetizer with truffles added $50 to the bill.  as has been mentioned here a few times, the breads are amazing. it's really hard not to eat too much of it. we loved the bacon bread and the gruyere puffs. my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  recommended apps: Sea urchin with langoustine which was amazing and so beautifully presented, truly an exceptional dish. lobster in a thinly sliced turnip with sweet and sour dressing had a nice portion of lobster meat. we also had the Carpaccio of foie gras and Paris mushrooms, veal raviolis cooked in broth with black truffle which were both excellent.  I felt the appetizers were more of a star than the mains. my favorite entrees were the duck with foie gras and the Roasted veal chop in its natural jus, crisp thin chanterelle ravioli. we also had the Lobster roasted with chestnuts and asparagus, shellfish jus, which we both felt has a little too chewy although the sauce was superb. the biggest disappointment was the Pan-fried sea bass with a lemongrass foam and stewed baby leeks which was beautiful to look at but the fish was clearly overcooked and very dry. we both knew immediately after taking one bite. we mentioned it to the server who offered us an extra dessert as compensation.   for dessert we both had a chocolate souffle, but we didn't have to pre-order it so I'm not sure how it was ready to serve right after ordering. we also felt it was very dry and too large. the scoop of ice cream helped, but neither of us could finish it. they bring a cart with 40 small candied sweets and small cakes and tarts which, in retrospect, I would have preferred over the souffle, but by the time the cart came around we were too full to enjoy it.  now for the disappointment. the service was good, but not exceptional. for the most part, kind of perfunctory and a little cold. I'm not sure if it was because we didn't order wine, but by the time we got near the end of the meal, I didn't feel like we were getting the exemplary service that we should have considering the food and reputation. some of the reviewers' comments here with similar complaints think it's because they didn't order wine. I'm not sure if this is the reason or not. the staff in a top restaurant needn't be obsequious, but at this level, the service should be outstanding and something that adds to the value of the experience.  I'm glad for the experience and many of the dishes were definitely best of the best, but I'm not sure I'll come back.",

It's 8 courses, but it's more like 24 course because each course typically comes with 3 things. It's perfectly paced, perfectly thought out.  We loved the bread and dessert carts. I know it seems like a waste of stomach space, but these are just so fun and enjoyable.  The steak was out of this world.   All other dishes were perfectly done and surprising. We loved the flavor combinations and things we would not have thought of. They manage to do the finest of dining without the pretension.   Our only regret is that we didn't know until too late that you could request a complimentary limousine pickup from your hotel. Our fault  My other tip is you must train for eating this meal like you would a real eating contest. Otherwise you will lose stamina for this meal. I recommend you go to the gym in the morning, book a massage, and then go to the steam room. Then have a green juice and lots of water. Avoid alcohol and gambling; your really want to be able to savor this experience.  We can't wait to come here again!  PS For two people, with no wine service, it came out to something like $1350. Not cheap, but truly worth it for a special occasion",

We spent 2-3 hours there (and yet it didn't feel that long- to be honest we never spent that much time in a restaurant feeling that comfortable). Service is top- notch!  After decided on what we wanted, the server came with a cart full of bread and started explaining all different types of bread. I had to remember which one I wanted. My boyfriend chuckled because he just lost all his memories of all the breads on the cart so he asked the server to get what's best out of the cart. The butter!!! Love.  Some of our dishes: Amuse Bouche Cauliflower Puree: On our fist sip, we knew this was going to be a great night! It was rich and tasty! (8/10)  Cold Appetizer Le Homard- Maine Lobster with sweet & sour dressing: The lobster cooked to perfection, the dressing was very refreshing to cleanse the richness from the previous dish. (9/10)  Le Tartare de Saumon- salmon tartare and caviar: The salmon was really tasty and the caviar complemented the salmon very well (9/10)  Hot Appetizer La Langoustine- Truffled langoustine, foie gras emulsion, and green cabbage (suppl. $35): MY FAVORITE DISH! This dish had a lot of different flavors in it, and yet I could taste every bit of layers! And they perfectly complemented each other to create one heck of an amazing dish! (12/10)   Main Course Le Veau- veal in Thai Broth, vegetable couscous w/ broccoli: My boyfriend loved it!! I didn't try it because I'm allergic to veal.  Le Homard- Grilled Lobster in Malabar pepper sauce with baby spinach: I was okay with this dish, but it was still an above average dish. (7/10)  PS: Our main dish came with mashed potato ( I forgot what the classy name they had for it). I didn't see the yelpers mention this a lot when I read for reviews, but this is the best mashed potato I have had in my whole life! My boyfriend is not a big fan of carbs, but he loved this potato like no other. Very creamy, rich, tasty, all in once!! (9.5/10)  Dessert Lychee Sorbet: I forgot what they called this. For me it was okay, but my bf loved it! It was the perfect dessert to close the meal. It was fresh, light, sweeten perfectly.  Le Rubis- Raspberry Dome: I loveeee this dessert! It looked elegant and it tasted incredible! It has different layers of flavors and the white thing on the bottom (I didn't know that was it, but it was absolutely amazing!!! (10/10)  They were not done. They brought  a cart of beautiful, elegant looking desserts for us to choose. My favorite is the banana eclair! To top it off, they gave us a parting gift, which I ate a day later to bring back home. It was yummy, fruity, and still moist even after a day or two old.  This place is one of the best restaurants I've been to. Yes it has a hefty price tag, but it is definitely worth every penny.",

The saffron bread was excellent and the creamy mashed potatoes were to die for.",

Over the years, I have been able to dine at several greats like Charlie Trotter's in Chicago and the French Laundry in California's wine country. This restaurant seriously ranks up there with the best.  From the elegant atmosphere, the attentive staff and the fabulous cuisine this is one of the best upscale \"dining experiences\" in the area. When I say \"dining experience\", that is what they offer. It is the experience that counts, right?  I came here with my best friend during one of her Vegas visits. We were seated in the side room which was fine with us because we were girl chatting. Our server was with us 110% and offered his suggestions when I asked, what his favorites were regarding the bread and dessert carts. I told him I favored pistachio and he loaded my plate with little delights. He was the greatest!  The La Langoustine raviolis were so delicate and heavenly. Three truffled langoustine raviolis with green cabbage were plated perfectly. The cabbage in the middle gave it color and added texture to the dish.  At the end my friend and I were gifted with pretty purple gift bags with a lemon pound cake. My goodness it was good. I actually ate a slice when I got home after my full Joel Robuchon meal.  I truly recommend this restaurant as your next Vegas dining experience.",

The staff were very kind and attentive. The \"set\" menu had a few choices.  When we asked about recommendations, our waiter explained each and every dish on the menu and recommended us to just choose anything that we won't be disappointed. We went ahead and ordered. The food mostly was tasty except for the main course - the sea bass. I couldn't finish it as it tasted so bland to me. The dish was mostly white color and didn't look appetising. When asked by the waiter as to why I didn't finish, I replied that I have had better sea bass dishes and that this one was very bland to me. He thanked me for the input and offered another main entree. At that point, the rest of my party had already finished their entrees and I didn't want to put in a new order. I simply passed on the offer. However, in my opinion, the management should have compensated in another way considering the fact that our party of four spent a little over $1200 that evening. I don't think I will return to that restaurant again.",

Being in Vegas, it's very close to home and a wonderful departure from many of the restaurants on the west coast.   The Chef at this location was wonderful in accommodating my dairy free and gluten free needs without compromising taste. It was such beautiful presentation and did not lack in anything. I had to ask servers to refill my tea a few times and that shouldn't happen at any restaurant.   Service at times was slow which was a bit unimpressive considering the price per person but overall what an experience.   There are options where you can do $445 menu which is 17 courses and ranges all the way down to 3 courses as well which is around $150.   We did the 5 course menu which was perfect and with the amuse bouche it came out to about 8 total courses which was over a course of 3 hours and with wonderful company, the three hours flew by.   My counterpart had a meat centric meal which he loved and had dessert that looked like it was transported from space and each was better than the course before.   Lovely place - just be prepared to spend some moolah and a lot of your time.",

    "text": "Feeling fancy, don't cha?  Well if you have a few hundred bucks to spend in Vegas, spend it at Joel Robuchon!  Trust me, it is better than taking your chances at the Crap Table.  Where to start?  My partner and I opted for the Menu Degustation, which was $445 per person without beverage nor gratuity.  Okay, your first thought may be along the line of... \"Oh shitte, really?  You cray cray.\"  Wait, read on you must before concluding this.  The dinner started with an assortment of bread.  Well, it is more like a galore of bread.  All types of bread that I could ever think of were present on the \"bread cart\".  If bread it your thing, you've died and gone to bread heaven.  Bread is serve with silky, and oh oh so delicious, France butter.  Our waiter gave us a 30 second spill about the butter, its origin and why it shall be the best thing that ever landed on my tongue.  Unfortunately, between reading the menu, his Frenchie accent, and the ambience noise, all I heard was \"blah, blah, blah, enjoy.\"  To his credit, he was right!  The butter was to die for when paired with fresh baked bread.  I'm not a big fan of bread.  I loved it, nonetheless!  Let's move on to the bulk of the review.  The dinner consisted of 17 dishes and served over 4 services.  Each service consisted of 3-4 different dishes.  Not to mention that this exclude the delectable dessert dishes and seductive sweet cart, which your sweet tooth is undoubtedly will be satisfied.  Oh, how can I forget the coffee and cappuccino to end our night with.  To review all 17 dishes in detail, at least to me, is an impossible feat.  Hence, I will only focus on the top three dishes that I thought were phenomenon.   First up: Caramelized Black Cod with daikon and lime zest.  This fish was cooked perfectly!  I was left wanting more. The whole fish type of more.  The cod was so moist and just melt in your mouth.  As expected, you could really taste the freshness of the fish.   My second favorite was the main course, Kagoshima beef, seared with Chanterelle stuffed macaroni and shavings of fresh parmesan.  Perfect marble and it paired so well with my wine.  Speaking of which we got a bottle of Pinot Noir from Torii Mor.  We got this bottle in anticipation of this very beef dish.  We were not disappointed.  The bottle was also reasonably priced compared to the dinner.  I could be without the stuff macaroni, but my partner couldn't get enough of it.  I wanted all beef and hers portion of the beef, and she wanted my portion of the macaroni.  LOL.  The ultimate favorite was the very first dish, Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab and crustacean gelee.  Now keep in mind, I was not necessarily impressed by the \"100 Eyeball Looking Decor\".  Nonetheless, the dish was to die for.  The king crab was so damn fresh.  The caviar was so delectable.  I'm not a fan of caviar, but this was so delicious.  It has to be top quality, as I had so-so and so-terrible caviar before as well.  The crustacean gelee exploded with flavors.  It is like an ocean party in your mouth!  All my taste buds were awakened and that made me curious about what else to come for the rest of the evening.  What a great starting dish.  I can't speak enough about this.  I've posted a photo of the menu and other dishes for you all to check out.  The overall ambience was great and not to be left out of this review.  Where we sat was a remake of what a night at garden would be.  The setting was romantic and worked for us.  I do wish the table wasn't so long.  For a party of two, we sat at a semi-narrow table that's was stretched along the length.  Not sure how to described it.  Maybe it was just me.  Provided service was up to par and friendly.   Overall, this restaurant was worthy of 3 Michelin Stars and a must try for those visiting Sin City (Las Vegas).  Just be sure to visit the actual restaurant.  They have a sister restaurant right next to their main place and it is only 1 Michelin star.  It is more like cafe style where you can see the chef making the food.  We plan to try their sister restaurant our next visit to Vegas.   Expect to pay about $1200 - $1300 for dinner if you plan to have decent wine.  It will be a night you'll remember for a long time.  Bon Appetit my fellow Yelpers!!!!!",

    "text": "Certainly the gold standard in fine dining. This place is all class (though I found the faux patio and lamps a little off). Starting from the arrival in the house limo, the hostess was fantastic in walking us in through the Mansion entrance and just made the whole experience really something different.   The 2 appetizers, 1 main, 1 dessert and sweets selection was enough to fill me up but not make me uncomfortably full the way the complete tasting menu (of like 15 dishes) would. My date (who was petite) had just the appetizer, main and sweet selection served to her and she was full by that.  The bread cart was impressive. The bacon baguette is excellent. The brioche, rustic bread and regular baguette are rather forgettable. The basil bun and saffron one were memorable and worth trying.  The cold lobster starter was very tasty and excellently prepared.  The langoustine ravioli were mind blowing. The protein inside was perfectly cooked while the pasta coating was delicate but tasty. Getting it with the foie gras emulsion made it perfectly balanced. The lettuce with the emulsion was the tastiest piece of green ever without losing the original vegetable flavor and texture.  The caviar dish was unique and tasty though the least favorite of our starters. It was like eating a bird's nest with caviar and egg.   The veal cheeks were perfectly good and a well balanced dish with the broth and veggies. That said, I was a little surprised by how much asian influence it and other dishes had given the French heritage of the place. It was very well complimented by the recommended Pinot noir from burgundy.  The lobster main course was delicious. The initial time they served it, it came out a little chewy but they had no qualms redoing it for us quickly. We were very happy with it the second time around.  The take on Black Forest dessert was incredible. It was a unique experience and definitely something I never seen before. They actually comp'ed us this after the \"lobster incident\" which was really nice of them and unnecessary but definitely appreciated.  The lemon flavored dessert in sugar bubble was beautifully presented like a real lemon.  The tiramisu was the most memorable among the sweet selections.  I was impressed by the service - friendly, professional, and yet not overbearing or pushy. I did think serving itself was a little less polished than at Jean George while the place wasn't also trying to have the casual vibe of Noma. Still, it was clearly top notch service.  I'd come back here in a heart beat. Easily the best fine dining in Vegas.",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this meal and it didn't disappoint.  6 course prix fixe menu:  things started off with the massive selection from the bread cart. i can't beging to remember everything, but i had milk bread, bacon, basil.  Was also given an amuse of crab meat served w/ osetra caviar in a 'joel robuchon' tin. Very luxurious and a great start to the meal.  Now the selected courses began. in order, I had:  Uni, octopus, prawns appetizer served with a seaweed gelatin. It looked interesting and tasted great, this course and the amuse were my favorite of the night.  Lettuce veloute with onion foam and bacon. I'm not very experienced in the realm of french soups (give me shark fin or fish stomach soup any day), but for my taste buds this was the downer of the evening.   Overseasoned and not served as hot as I would have preferred.   Turbot.. served with octopus, artichokes, tomatoes.. Sort of lost track of what was in this dish as I was starting to get full. Hadn't had turbot before but I'd like to again. Octopus was delicious too just as in the first course.   Veal cheeks served in a curry sauce... yeah I feel a little guilty eating veal, but it's easy to get over.  Another very good dish ,but at this point I was stuffed and not enjoying the meal as much. If you had shown me the size of each course before the meal started and told me I would struggle to finish everything I would have just laughed. Damn that bread cart!  Cheese cart... just like the bread cart, an impressive presentation of each item was given.. and i can only remember having roquefort , fleur de marquis, and something that resembled orange cottage cheese.   Dessert..  I was expecting one course, rasberry and vanilla chou... a nice light pastry... but to top things off, a sample of sorbets was brought out and also yet another cart, this time full full of little chocolate treats. The waiter asked our preferences then made his selections for us.  Overall, very happy with the meal. Presentation was very impressive, sometimes over the top, but memorable.    The bill is obnoxious, but no regrets.  I knew going in thinking this would be the most I've ever spent to eat/drink, I found cocktails and the wine list to be reasonable. Nobody comes into a restaurant like this not expecting to pay for (or be treated to) a unique and luxurious dining experience.   My only regret was not asking Hosea from Top Chef if he's as lucky at gambling as he is in cooking competitions (he was seated nearby).",

    "text": "Best meal of my life.  Yes, it sound like I was exaggerating.  But I'm a foodie and on travels I hunt out some of the highest rated restaurant.   I had the full tasting menu and passed on the wine.  Why?  Because if a meal is truly exceptional I don't want to dull my senses.    I'm not going to go into the meal because so many others have.  Just a few hints for those going.  1) They pick you up in a Limo and take you to an exclusive entrance.  It's a great way to start the experience.  Much better than walking through a smoky casino.  2) If you have a course you don't like.  Tell them.  There was a course I didn't like and when they asked about it, I said; \"Lets just say it was not my favorite course\".   Nothing else was said.  But when the waiter came back he had a replacement course for the one I didn't enjoy.  They truly do everything they can to make it the best experience. So tell them if anything would make your experience better.  3) If you would like to gamble on the way out, tell them.  There is an exceptional private gambling area they will take you to.  The only problem is that most people are using $10,000 chips.  (  Ohhhh my gawd!)  Only con is the price. Just forget about the cost.  Realize this is a once in a lifetime experience.",

    "text": "I decided to have an early Valentine Day's dinner by going here.  Better going now than during the weekend of VD.  I usually have a big stomach for food.  And I was hesitant on going for a four-course meal, knowing that I would want to eat more.  By the end of the night though, I made the correct decision on going for four, since I was nearly full.  I went with an amuse-bouche full of berries, which was fantastic.  The appetizer consisted of a chestnut soup with bacon foam.  I'm not a chestnut person at all, but I enjoyed it; probably because of the foam  The main course consisted of the veal cheeks over the bouillon with couscous.  I expected this dish to have a bland taste, but the amount of bouillon worked really well.  The components of the main course came together, that Robuchon himself along with the executive chef Claude should be commended with a great meal.   I feel nearly embarrassed to pull out my camera and take pictures just because it would look too obnoxious in front of the service.  And speaking of the service, it was top f'n notch.  Even when my glass was a quarter empty, they would be there to refill it almost immediately.  And they were just lovely when rolling around the bread cart as well as the dessert cart.  Just awesome, so awesome.  Being at Robuchon is definitely an experience that I will never forget.  Thank you so much!  edit:  I didn't know there was complimentary limo service.  Had I known.... :(",

Based off my foggy Las Vegas memory from a trip I took 2 years ago, it had the gaudiness of Michael Mina, the food quality of Gary Danko, and the service and experience of French Laundry.  That's really the best way I can describe what's possibly the best meal of my life.    This dinner is what convinced me that Robuchon branded caviar over dungeness crab is match made in heaven.  It also taught me that there aren't ever such things as a limited quantity of mignardises.",

    "text": "[Michelin Stars #13-15]  I decided to treat myself to my first three-star Michelin dining experience in honor of celebrating...well, life. I did not, however, take the gold limo that other Yelpers have mentioned;  Aimee P is far too classy for gold limos. No, I'd much rather roll up in a yellow taxi.    So what makes the meal of a lifetime?    Let's start with the bread cart. My eyes lit up and my inner carb fiend was in full effect when I that cart came rolling toward my table.  Rosemary brioche?  Saffaron bread?  Basil bread?  Ementaler bread?  Bacon brioche?  Milk bread?  Yes, please.  Of course, the basics were there as well, and Joel makes an exceptional baguette.  The rest of the bread was also amazing:  flaky, crusty, chewy, deceptively light.  I could have a meal consisting of the bread alone.    But let's not forget the butter cart.  Oh, that's right:  even the butter has its own cart!  Well, there's some sort of fancy olive oil there as well, but why on EARTH would one get the olive oil when underneath a glass dome is a block of the richest, creamiest butter you've ever seen?  Watching the waiter shave off a piece was like watching him scoop ice cream.  Smooth.    I wasn't sure what to expect of a 16 course tasting menu with wine pairings (offered in three tiers, with $295 being the lowest tier);  at the very least, I expected to be very, very drunk.  But the sommelier came by and explained that most of the wines were meant to be paired with several consecutive courses.  There was a total of 6 wine courses to go with my 16 food courses (+1 amuse bouche).    16 courses of love:  - (amuse bouche) caviar, fennel cream, lobster.  yum.   - (1) foie gras and potato carpaccio, with black truffle shavings.  A very well balanced dish and remarkably, the part that impressed me the most was the perfectly cooked potato (but perfect like I've never had it before!).     - (2-4) three courses of black truffles prepared in different ways (the French seem to be huge fans of those trios, huh?);  my favorite was Robuchon's take on scrambled eggs and toast:  crispy truffle tart with onion confit, THE richest scrambled eggs I've ever had, and of course, black truffles.     - (5) deep fried frog leg   - (6-8) a seafood trio consisting of lobster, an interesting take on sea urchin with wasabi emulsion, and langoustine ravioli.  I was impressed to see sea urchin on the menu, knowing its...unpopularity.  Props to Robuchon for taking that risk anyway!  The langoustine ravioli was also wonderful:  I wasn't a big fan of langoustines, but having them prepared by the Robuchon kitchen has made me reconsider.     - (9) kabocha pumpkin veloute with ginger foam.  Ahhh, gastronomy in the works.  This was a welcome break from the previous heavy courses.     - (10) bone marrow and sweetbread ragout with truffle jus.     - (11) olive oil poached sea bass with lemongrass and leeks, with hints of curry.  This was possibly my favorite course.  It was a nice, light dish with incredible aromas and flavors.  I rarely see French restaurants willing to dabble into the realm of fusion, so I enjoyed this one a great deal.     - (12) duck and my second course with foie gras, as well as some sweet and sour fruits.  A more traditional course, but executed wonderfully nontheless.     - (13) farrow risotto with gold leaf   - (14) pear and almond milk emulsion   - (15) chocolate and fruit confit   - (16) dessert cart  The dining room was decorated with large vases overflowing with gorgeous large, white orchids fit for the hairpiece of a bride.  Up till this point, the most extravagant floral display I've seen is the bushels of beautiful red roses at Bouchon;  Robuchon's orchids put these to shame (I guess that's what a $400 meal gets you!).  The motif was purple:  large, plush purple velvet chairs, purple walls, purple accents.  Even the gift bag I received at the end of the evening was tied in flowing organza lavender ribbon. (Yeahh, I know nobody cares about the color, but purple happens to make Aimee P very happy)  Service throughout the evening was impeccable, from the elegant hostess who held the tall glass doors open for us and then graciously seated us, to the waiters who were on point in bringing out each course with flair, to the server who was gracious enough to allow me not one but TWO plates from the dessert cart (what can I say, I struggle when too many OPTIONS are put before me!), and to the half dozen waiters and busboys who seemed always available to satisfy my every dining whim.  The attitude of the servers was unpretentious, unlike some other fine dining establishments I've visited.    I had my Robuchon meal at the end of a three-day Vegas Michelin binge.  It turns out that this is my only regret.  An experience like Joel Robuchon deserves to stand on its own, not immediately following two other great meals.  Next time, I'll know better.",

    "text": "If you are a fine dining fan who enjoys haute French cuisine, and all the carts and indulgent dishes that go with it,  then this is the restaurant for you.  However, I found the dining experience to be uninspiring, aesthetically tasteless, and not worth the money.  I enjoy fine dining; I have notches on my culinary belt from the French Laundry, Manresa, Chez Panisse (it still deserves a Michelin star!), Patina,  Melisse,  Daniel, and Le Cirque when it resided at the New York Palace.  Joel Robuchon was the weakest of all these restaurants.       I greatly disliked the design of the 16 course menu; it caters to a diner with a Las Vegas mentality.  Yes, the restaurant is in Vegas, but that doesn't mean it should carry over the feelings of excess and poor taste onto its plates.  I agree with Thomas Keller's philosophy that a tasting menu should not repeat ingredients and give the diner just enough of a taste of a dish and then leave you wanting more.  Having three caviar dishes and two truffle dishes is excessive and killed the experience of the delicacies for me.          Bread and mignardises carts with multitudes of choices is frustrating to deal with and I would prefer the mignardises be served in separate groups as they are at French Laundry.  I also found it frustrating that the cheese cart was not included in the 16 course meal.  Why was it not part of the $435 show?        A menu designed with a host of dishes constituting a buttery sauce at their  base becomes boring after a while.  The scallop, uni, caviar with corn veloute,  sea bass, lobster, and then the veal in a dark sauce were the same ideas over and over again.  At least throw in a really exotic meat like a game hen or venison to spice it up...... or goat!  Melisse had goat, excellent goat at that.          Toning down flavors weakens the potency of a dish, leaving the poor diner to the mercy of the sauce.   If uni is going to be on the menu, let its potent, briny, coastal flavor dominate the dish, otherwise a well cooked kitchen sponge would have sufficed and none would have been the wiser.   The earthy mushrooms were certainly allowed to shine, why not the uni?       The use of gold on more than one dish is tasteless, both literally and aesthetically.       On the bright side they had an excellent wild oats dish prepared risotto style, by far the best course on the menu.  And it should have been the only dish with gold leaf.       The head waiter was professional and formal, but not personable.  He never returned to check in on us or to say good bye at the end of the meal.  How I longed for the waiters from Manresa, Daniel, and French Laundry who made it seem as if I were an honored guest dining at their homes.   Maybe it's a characteristic of French (or Parisian) service not to be personable.   If so, that style is best left in France.         The Bacarat lamp on the table was more clunky than elegant.  Cutlery was pedestrian and the flatware gimmicky and inappropriate for a restaurant garnishing three Michelin stars.  Example: the trio of caviar dishes came out on a painted board with a label that stated \"Joel Robuchon Caviar\" a midst a background picture of the fish eggs.   A shame that many of the dishes were cheapened by this kind of presentation.      The final insult was the price of the meal.  I have no problem paying $435 for a tasting menu, but it better be excellent in concept and execution with service and tools to match.  This dinner was not worth the price and it is especially painful when I compare it to the cost of more memorable meals from New York and San Francisco's finest restaurants that cost a little more than half of what this Las Vegas mediocrity cost me.  Why on Earth were the prices so high?  I can only assume it must cost a fortune to have quality meats, produce, ingredients, etc. delivered to the desert.   Or maybe it was all that gold......",

    "text": "Not a frequent yelper but want to save others from my mistake. This meal was supposed to be the highlight of our Vegas trip- sadly, it was a low point. This would be zero stars but for our friendly waiter and the excellent wine pairings.   According to other yelp users, a limo service is offered to take you to and from the restaurant. We were not offered this service and when I called to inquire I was treated as if I was making it up! There was something a little disappointing about dropping 2500 on dinner and having to walk 200 yards through a smoky casino to get to a cab. I also was disappointed that I wasn't offered a dark napkin (or at less a nonpilling one) and that I wasn't given a fresh napkin when I went to the restroom. Minus one star for service.   Decor in the restaurant is odd. Purple and gold and \"opulence, I has it\". Todd pointed out that the impressionistic art was in contrast to the period decor- I thought it was odd the hostesses were in Asian attire at a traditional french restaurant. Gaudy and odd I can live with, but it carried over to the table setting. There were fake candles and glitter covered Styrafoam balls on the table as decorations! And salt and pepper shakers. Can't believe food from the chef of the century would require seasoning. Minus one star for ambiance.   Ordered the 16 course degustation menu. Bread cart,  12 plates and dessert cart. Not one memorable in a good way course. Plating was unattractive at best. There were inedible garnishes- costume jewelry and ribbons. And they taped down the bowls to the serving trays with scotch tape. And to top it off, the cheese cart is not included in the degustation menu! Minus two stars for food.   Kicker- up most of the night with stomach issues. If my phone call re: limo service was any indication, my call to inform the restaurant of this will not go well.   Only bright spot was the $595/person wine pairing. They opened several nice bottles for us to enjoy. They were knowledgeable and enjoyed talking about the wine. The pairings were good, not great, but the wine was so special it made up for it. If I had to go back (I never will) I'd ask for the wine pairing.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is the \"chef of the century\".  This place has three michelin stars, 4.5 stars on yelp, and recommended by foodies.  So naturally, after dining at a handful of michelin restaurants, we had high expectations for Joel Robuchon.  For chris sakes, Rod Stewart was sitting at the table behind us!!!  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night, and seeing him added a little extra touch.    After doing extensive research, my boyfriend and I opted for the two courses.  Here's our story:  The Pros: - Bread cart was AMAZING!!! - Dessert cart was awesome! - Amuse-bouche was yummy caviar - The limo ride was very much appreciated  The Cons: The Food.  Aside from the above, everything was disappointing.    - Le Canard: duck was passing at best.  The foie gras on the side was overcooked. We love foie gras, but had to force it down...foie gras should not be that way. - The King Crab wasn't even memorable.  I was disappointed after a taste.  It wasn't bad, just nothing special. - La Chataigne soup was very bacon in flavor.  I can honestly compare it to bacon cooked on a stove top, and thrown into cream sauce.  The foie gras in the soup was overcooked as well.  I wouldn't even know it was foie gras unless I read the menu.  - Le Veau: veal was passing.  It wasn't something I tasted and felt \"wow, I must have this again\".    After we finished our \"experience\" we felt disappointed with the food, and mentioned that it is not worth three michelin stars.  In addition, I started to feel queasy.  I thought it was the food's richness, however, if only that were it.  I spent the whole night amidst a toilet, throwing up.   I had one glass of wine, so it was not alcohol related.  Drunkedness and heart burn over food poisoning any day.  FAIL!  In my honest opinion, Joel Robuchon in Vegas is living off of its hype.  It's either politics that gave him the stars, or what it used to be.  But the quality is sub-par, so save your money, do not dine here.    So overall: Joel Robuchon's Food - BAD Food Poisoning - VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!",

    "text": "After much raving to friends about this restaurant I had the opportunity to return this past weekend.  This time, we took a friend to celebrate his birthday, lucky devil.  For a moment we contemplated doing the 6 course prix fixe, but after the sensible person in our party (birthday boy's wife) pointed out that for a mere $ 200 more a person we would be getting a lot more food, we immediately made up our mind, 16 course Menu Degustation for all!  It's always best to do a tasting menu as the chef showcases his best dishes to us in this manner.  The bread cart was phenomenal as usual.  From previous experience I knew better than to have more than one piece.  This time around, having dinner with 3 other people allowed me to have small tastes of their bread selection. The rosemary roll was my only choice and one I enjoyed tremendously, the flakiness was comparable to the best croissants.  This time around the food was very good, and everyone at the table was impressed.  I was a little more reserved with the accolades, perhaps I'm being a bit blase.  I just remember my first visit, every bite blew my mind, but perhaps like a first kiss, it is something to be cherished and not recreated.  My only True complain is that the shellfish courses were a bit over cooked for my palate.  I prefer my shellfish a bit more on the raw side.  Other than that, every course was tremendously enjoyable.  Every dish that contained a sauce was amazing, True traditional French cooking at it's best.  There's a reason M. Robuchon is the chef of the century.  I was mortified last time I had dinner at Daniel NYC when my dinning mates decided it was imperative to photograph every  course served, some more than once!  To my embarrassment , the presentation of Le Caviar (caviar served 3 ways) was worthy of the paparazzi, the birthday boy (a pastry chef at one of the top NY French patisseries) and I had to breakout our camera phones.  The Maki was a bit of a disappointment as the couscous overpowered the caviar.  The Salmon tartar with caviar was amazing.  But nothing can prepare you for the complexity  in flavors that are contained in \"un veloute de mais glace tremblotant aux croutons dores\" I suppose the name of the dish should have been a hint to that effect.  One of my favorite dishes of the evening was the accompaniment to the scallop.  I am not sure what \"fregolas avec une emulsion coralline\" is, but I can certainly have a bowlful of it and die happy.  My second favorite dish of the evening was the last savory dish \"L'Epeautre du Pays de Sault mitonne et dore a l'or fin\" which probably would be my last request were I in death row.  I was disappointed to have the main course be a rib-eye and not Kobe, like my last visit, but the sauce that was served along the steak was enough to forgive such oversight.  I suppose having 4 or 5 courses with black truffles, one of which is a tart with probably a whole truffle on top of it makes the dinner worthy of the price tag. But is the last dessert that makes the whole experience great.  A loud sigh was heard when I tasted the second dessert course, \"cremeux au cur de Guanaja, bavarois a la Poire Williams\".  The wait staff turned around to insure that everything was in order.  I was frozen for a few seconds, not able to move or utter another word.  That fleeting moment is what makes this restaurant worth every penny!  Not every dish is perfect, but if a tasting menu gets a sigh out of me, then the chef is worthy of my patronage.",

    "text": "Amazing! All I can say is that this is a fantastic restaurant.  The beautiful purple dining room is so welcoming and comfortable, the waiters and hostesses are so attentive, the service is better than I could imagine, the cocktails are simple, supertasty and refreshing and of course the food is great!  The bread trolley with the butter from Brittany was a wonderful way to start the meal. Followed by a beautiful amouse bouche and a couple of courses that were just lovely. I had the meringue dessert and loved it. But it didn't stop there, after the meal we were offered to take our pick from a trolley full of little chocolates and small pieces of confectionery and it couldn't have been a better end to a wonderful evening. This restaurant is worth every cent. Eating at Joel Robuchon is a once in a life time experience, which I hope I will be lucky enough to get twice in my life, or more. Amazing!",

    "text": "I vowed sometime ago that it would take a truly magnificent culinary escapade to usher me back into the world of Yelp reviewing. Alas, that moment, and by moment I mean a 4+ hour marathon of immense anticipation, stupendous gluttony and hints of regret along the lines of \"Was I suppose to take more than 4 seconds to enjoy that entire dish?\", came to fruition just months ago. My girlfriend extraordinaire and I experienced (and yes, you don't just go and eat at, you experience) Joel Robuchon in all its grand outrageousness - classic French cuisine mastered by one of the greatest chefs alive and delivered in a manner that was impeccably French and Vegas at the same time.  Not many restaurants offer limo pick-up for its customers, but Joel Robuchon enlists the MGM Grand's fleet of limos to pick you up from your hotel. We were promptly picked up at 8:20 at the front door of Encore and ushered to the entrance of the Mansion (attached to the back of the MGM Grand). It's a whimsically elitist experience walking through the back entrance of the MGM, having every employee you walk by stand and greet you, but it builds toward that level of anticipation to a truly unique night.   We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant with the perfect view of the rest of the dining room. The gleaming chandelier in the middle of the room lowered itself from the seemingly 50 foot ceiling. The furniture here reminds me of a Prince album on crack.  We were greeted by the head waiter and given our menus. JR offers a variety of prix fixe options with you being able to choose a 2-4 meal prix fixe or diving head first into culinary oblivion with the 16 course menu degustation at $385pp. Needless to say, this was a \"when in Vegas...\" moment, and we opted to go with Joel's tour de cuisine themed after Autumn. Being Yelp has a pretty modest word limit, I won't go into too much detail for each of the 16 courses.  If you've read any of the other reviews for JR, you'll see mention of the bread and dessert carts in most of them. Having been to a good number Michelin restaurants in the past year, I can say these carts are truly one of a kind, and they are definitely worth indulging in as they're guaranteed to have something to fit your liking (assuming you don't hate bread and/or chocolate, in which case you might feel a little bad while watching every other patrons' face light up as they stuff their faces with these cart items).  The menu itself featured a wide array of proteins (sea urchin, filet, foie gras, lobster, duck breast, escargot, mushrooms, the list goes on) in a variety of preparations and styles. I consider myself to be a pretty adventurous eater, and eating through each of these plates was like going through a fantastic fiction novel. The pages of flavor unraveling with each bite as you feel this irresistible urge to continue reading, even when a part of your brain is yelling at you, \"No more!\"  Some people say that the more you pay for a meal, the more disappointment you're setting yourself up for, and to be honest, I walked into the meal with a reserved sense of fear - that all the hype and expectations would overpower our tastebuds. That no quality or amount of food could warrant the cost. Needless to say, Joel Robuchon lived up to its namesake and left us in unparalleled foodie comas. Having had a few months to digest and recoup, I'm definitely ready for a sequel...",

I have eaten a wide range of Michelin starred restaurants and NOTHING compares to Joel Robuchon's brilliant cuisine. Days later, my better half and I were still discussing the foie gras appetizer and the veal cheek main course. And the bread cart... oh, the bread cart.... really, you just have to see it to believe it. It will change your life, seriously.  The service was also impeccable--timely, yet never intrusive, and the sommelier went out of her way to provide us with a pile of information.

    "text": "Ahhhh-mazing this place is! Or, well...that's an understatement...Robuchon is beyond amazing from taste, to presentation, to staff, to atmosphere, etc. etc. This place deserves more than 5 stars on yelp for sure.  Be prepared for an awesome experience while you dine here as you spoil your tastebuds for approximately three hours. Also, make sure you come hungry and be aware that money shouldn't be an issue when you dine here as you will definitely rack up a bill!  It is quite difficult to say what my favorite part of the meal was. Everything was superb and extraordinary. The selection of breads, cheeses and candied desserts were mindblowing! I wanted to try them all...  My friend and I enjoyed our meal in their psedo-garden which was quite nice and didn't come off cheesy looking. There, I loved the black cod dish that I ordered--you can taste the layers of flavor in this dish. My friend went with the lobster and veal dish. They were also so very good.  The things that I didn't really care to spend money on or would care less if they served this to me was the soup and the dessert. I also wasn't a big fan of their creme brulee as it tasted somewhat bland and the consistency was not to my liking.   Oh and I liked the fact that my friend and I weren't treated like we didn't have the money to spend, since we were probably the youngest ones in the restaurant during our time there.   Lastly, I want to say I came in very excited and full of energy and left feeling so tired and exhausted from such a lovely treat. And how nice of them to provide a nice chocolate treat along with a visual booklet of the restaurant at the end of the meal. I can't wait 'til I come in again!",

    "text": "After making a reservation to dine at Robuchon, I began to research such things as what to wear, what to expect price and menu-wise (yes, I knew it was expensive) and how to handle wine.  I read reviews, asked the few I could find who had dined there and even called the restaurant.  But in the end, I was not comfortable I got all of the information and it turns out some of it was just plain wrong.  Here iare the definitive answers after having dined there, along with my wife and another couple in December 2012: Men do not wear ties and some do not wear jackets.  We were the only ones in the restaurant wearing a jacket and tie.  Since neither is required and you will not be uncomfortable without a tie, I suggest just a jacket. The wine list does not start at $500.  The wine list is extensive, with wines from $60 to $60,000 a bottle.  While the markup is high at about two and a half times, there are good wines for under $125 that you will know, if you drink wine.  We were scared off of their list by reviews we read and took very nice bottles of wine (2002 Bryant and 2001 Mouton Rothschild) and paid the $100 corkage.  While we enjoyed our wines, in hindsight, we would have not bothered packing and taking them and simply bought wine. Speaking of wine, we found the sommelier to be less than helpful and even at $100 corkage, to be put off that we brought our own.  He dissed what we brought and tried hard to pour both bottles within the first few courses of our meals, presumably to cause us to buy more wine from the restaurant. We had to slow him down.  We also found out, he only decanted about 80% of the wine and left the rest in our bottles. Not sure if this was intentional (we know it is appropriate to leave a small amount to reduce sediment in the glasses), but it could be consTrued that he was trying to poach some of our wine. Fortunately, our waiter caught this and poured us the rest of our wines directly from the bottle. There is a 16 course tasting menu for $435 and there are four pre-fixe menu choices.  The six course was $250, the five course was $198, three course is $165 and two course is $130.  The men at our table had the six course and our wives had the five course.  I cannot comment on how much anyone else might eat, but suffice it to say if I returned, I would get the five course, as we were uncomfortably full by the last course and dessert.  We had been warned about the bread service and yes, it was over the top. But we exercised restraint and did not fill up on the bread, yet, we were overly full by the end. They made a mistake on one of my courses and in hindsight I wish I had said something.  I ordered the beef cheeks and instead was served a sliced veal. Worse yet, my wife had the beef cheeks as an earlier course and she raved about it.  At that point, though, I was so full and I did not want to hold up our meal by sending back the veal. Get the L'OEuf de Poule appetizer, period.  It is a crispy soft boiled egg with smoked salmon and oscetra caviar.  It is the best single food dish I have ever had anywhere, period.  It is a $60 supplement charge over the cost of the meal, but it is full of oscetra caviar and worth it.  Hard to believe this could be the case, but it is. Go for your birthday or tell them it is your birthday, even if it isn't.  The birthday cake they served was as good as, if not better than, the desserts they served.  It was the actual birthday of one in our party and although we were beyond full, we all loved the cake they served. The staff is friendly and not stuffy.  We enjoyed some playful exchanges with them.  They were there for our every need, yet did not hover over us. They were helpful with the menu choices. You may have read that they offer limo service to their guests.  What you did not read is that if you don't request it, at least 24 hours in advance, you will not receive it.  It was not offered to us when we made our reservation or when they called to confirm our reservation.   Since I knew of it and wanted to use it, I called the day of our reservation, and to my surprise and extreme disappointment, they said they would not do provide it.  Although I protested that it was never offered they would not budge.  So the tour of the Mansions and special greeting did not occur for us and we strongly resented how this was handled. Finally, if you are dining at Robuchon on the day you arrive in Las Vegas from the East Coast or Midwest, think about going a different night.  Our 8:30 dinner, which lasted until about 11:45, was actually a 10:30 dinner that lasted until 1:45 a.m.  Besides being overly full, we were all very tired in the final hour of our dinner.   So despite a few flaws, this was an excellent meal.  For the price, it should have been perfect.  I would return, have the four course dinner, including the egg with the $60 supplemental charge, have more of the bread, go on a day other than my first day in Vegas.",

    "text": "Dining at such a whimsical restaurant like Joel Robuchon is quite the experience of a lifetime so I am happy to write this review as my 500th!  Foodie/boyfriend extraordinaire surprised me with dinner at Joel Robochon for my birthday.  Chef of the Century - check. Three-Star Michelin - check. Forbes Five-Star recipient - check. AAA Five Diamond award - check. Wine Spectator Grand award - check. Sign me up!  My favorite dishes from the 16 course vegetarian degustation marathon menu included: *Le Tofu - crispy tofu fritter, garlic and watercress puree *La Chataigne - light chestnut cream with sweet onion foam *La Pomme de Terre - Chef Robuchon's signature whipped potatoes - carpaccio of potatoes covered with white truffle shavings *Les Taglierinis - taglierinis of vegetable and pesto  Keeping with my traditional Yelp review format, I've outlined what I found to be the pros and cons of my dining experience at Joel Robuchon, and some tips.  Pros: *Limousine picks you up and drops you off at your hotel *Arriving at the private entrance and the amazing walk through the MGM's super exclusive and secretive Mansion (not open to the general public and has only 22 suites) - incredible. *Restaurant is beautifully decorated in purple, black, white, and pink (my favorite colors), has fresh flowers throughout the restaurant, and a huge, beautiful crystal chandelier that I could stare at for hours  *Bread cart (more like a wagon) - tons of different breads to choose from *Vegetarian tasting menu is available (though it's basically just a meatless version of the regular tasting menu for the same price) *Large (and pricey) wine selection with excellent somalies *Amazing presentation of the food - I love the attention to detail and creativity that goes into each dish! *Every single one of the savory dishes on the 16 course menu was delicious. Truly flawless. *If you're not daring enough to try the 16 course menu, you're able to create your own menu! *Huge assortment of petifores which they allow you to choose from and best of all, revisit :)  Cons: *They do not serve tap water here but instead have patrons pay $10 for bottled Evian. Seems kinda of tacky to nickle and dime patrons when they're dropping $1K on a meal.  *Desserts - I was not a fan of any of the three desserts we were served. The L'Ananas (fresh pineapple inside a crunchy meringue, finished with an exotic mango fruit cocktail sauce) - I'm not a huge fan of fruit in dessert (uinless it's a tart) and do not like meringue. Onto the next dessert, the Le Cafe (coffee ice cream, dark chocolate ganache and tahitian vanilla) - this was inedible, it's one of the worse desserts I've ever had. Finally, we were served a meringue layered cake that they generously served for my birthday. In sum, I'm afraid the Joel Robuchon's pastry chef needs to revamp his/her's menu instead of relying on their (delicious) petifores to save the day. Dessert to me is chocolate and the dark chocolate ganache in the Le Cafe was inedible.  *Rushed service - our reservations were at 8:30pm and we both opted to splurge on the 16 course tasting menu and did not finish the extravaganza until 12:30am. I felt like the dishes were rushed because the employees (understandably) wanted to go home. I just wish they wouldn't offer a 16 course menu after 8pm if they can't serve it in a leisurely manner  *We ordered cocktails when we sat down and never received them. Since we also ordered wine we didn't make a big deal out of it. However, they STILL charged us $64 for the two cocktails even though we never received them. When we asked them to remove the charges when we received the bill they were a little off-put that we would make such a request even though it was their errors (not bringing the drinks and then charging)  *The parting gift included a copy of our 16 course menu, unfortunately they made an error and gave us two of the same menus and not the 16 course vegetarian menu which I had. However, upon calling them they graciously emailed the menu  Tips: *If you do order the 16 course menu, I'd recommend either fasting the day before or not finishing all your dishes because you will be stuffed to the gills after wards. In fact, I didn't eat the entire next day, I was still full!  *If you can't splurge on the 16 course tasting menu they also have more affordable options which include anywhere from 2-10 item tasting menus which will put you in the more reasonable $150-$350 range  *Note that many of the items you get to choose from to create your own tasting menu include supplements of $30-$80 per item (this is in addition to the base tasting menu price) - it can quickly add up  Bottom line, having flawless food compensates for the service issues and strange desserts - considering I live for desserts, I think it says a lot that I still enjoyed my dining experience here in spite of the disappointing finish. In sum, I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to dine at Joel Robuchon & would happily return",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon has the distinction of three michelin stars, a rating which indicates a Titanic force moving the world of food forward and the rating is well deserved. Here is some of the finest food on the west coast and if you can afford it comfortably then be prepared for a culinary exprience. However, if one cannot afford the arguably exorbitant prices comfortably then I would recommend passing this place by. Joel Robuchon plates elaborate complex tastes and flavors, this is a food lovers dream but it isn't for everyone and you don't want to walk away $1,000 out and dissatisfied by any means because of what you order. L'atelier next door is much more affordable and serving in the Tapas small plates fashion allows one to experience food of incredible if not equal quality plate by plate. The chef is a remarkable talent and his best offering is not actually on the menu they serve you. I knew of the roasted french hen with foie gras and requested it for me and my wife on our honeymoon. Suprisingly as the dish serves two people it is the cheapest offering on the menu but was one of the best things I have ever eaten or will ever eat and I know food. The only reason I have to give this establishment 4 stars is because of the terrible service and service can be everything. Our waiter was rude and to put in bluntly \"snooty\" which is inexcusable. The night before we had dined at Alex at the Wynn a two michelin star restaurant and one of the best in the country and had a great time. The environment of Joel Robuchon was stiff, quiet, and certainly not conducive to enjoying oneself. After we ordered the hen however, our waiter made an immediate turnaround seemingly respecting us more for having ordered this house specialty. The rest of the night was so much better we had to wonder why the waiters attitude was so cold and rude earlier. Nevertheless, the food is not to be matched. Desserts come in over a dozen varieties and are spectacularly playful.  The food is wonderful at Joel Robuchon's however L'atelier is right next door and for a good deal less money one can experience alot more plates and flavors all of which are up to par. my recommendation is if you have a special occasion dine here. Otherwise, go next door to experience the restaurant style that Joel Robuchon himself always dreamed of making, L'atelier.",

Visually enchanting, great aromas, amazing taste, basically everything you expect from a 3 Michelin place.  2 dislikes: 1) Everything was very hush hush.. Our server spoke so softly, it took 100% of my concentration to understand 2) My husband ordered some \"made -to-order\" desserts and our server completely forgot about it and brought the check directly.  But nonetheless, we had one of the best times here!",

Everything was good except for the food.  16 course tasting menu, nothing was impressive except the bill. Not worthy of even on Michelin star. I've eaten at better places. The two star Providence in LA should have five stars compared to this place. Jokes on me. Don't waste your time & money. There are better places than this in LV.",

    "text": "I've been to this beautiful restaurant twice, both times loved it.  No restaurant in Las Vegas comes close to this. You can taste the quality in every part of this restaurant.  Even though Michelin no longer rates Las Vegas restaurants as of 2009, this is easily comparable to all of the 3 Stars around the world.  This is the epitome of stuffy restaurants, however. You walk into a very ornate setting with velvet and purple and very quiet patrons (at least my two experiences).  You can expect a 3.5 hour dinner with a freaking awesome bread cart with so many breads that will make your head spin.  Both times we went for the complete chef's tasting which we kind of regretted since it was SO MUCH food. Not the best kind of food you want to eat before you go out but it was great.  Highly recommend this place if you have a spare night that you know you won't be raging hard with, and if you are up for one hell of a meal to remember in Vegas instead of your typical whatever Vegas restaurants.",

It amazed me with its variety and even the bread cart was absolutely fantastic. I adore the decor and especially those cute stools under the table for your purse. So lovely!

    "text": "Overall I was extremely impressed with Joel Robuchon. As should be obvious, you're dropping money on this meal, but in almost every regard, it is certainly worth it. The food across the board was delightful -- I never thought I'd be wowed by a bread cart, but I was blown away. Every dish was better than the last one and our waiter provided superb service. My girlfriend and I both look on the younger side, and in the past, we've been treated rudely/disdainfully by wait staff, especially at more upscale French restaurants. I was excitedly surprised to find that our waiter was the stereotypical overly pompous type, and was even capable of cracking some jokes and not taking himself too seriously.  Which brings me to the one negative about the meal -- the Som. Because the wine menu had bottle prices ranging from around $50 to ~$12,000, we asked what he would recommend considering our order, and a price range of $50-$80. He very condescendingly replied, \"well, we'll just need to skip to the domestics then,\" even though we could clearly see bottles in that range on the page we were on... Then he recommends a $95 bottle, \"if that's not TOO on the high end for you.\" Thanks chief.",

Very quiet and intimate....to be honest at times I felt it was too quiet...a fairly serious and formal atmosphere.   The bread cart was amazing, best breads I've ever had with the best butter and olive oil.   We got the 6 course tasting menu. Can't pronounce half the stuff we had but everything was very good. Couple dishes weren't as good as others and to be honest were rather intimidating...more as culinary art plate presentations rather than delivering familiar flavors. Great for foodies. Everything was extremely interesting.    The service was impeccable. The final bill will make you do a double take. About 1k for 6 course menu for 2 with half bottle of wine and one glass of wine. Yikes! I'm not sure even the best meal of my life is worth that much?! This meal wasn't the best of my life but it was very good.",

We came here by accident. I know, that doesn't sound right. Peter thought he was making a reservation at Bouchon & being uneducated in the Michelin rated restaurants at the time...thought Joel Robuchon and Bouchon were the same lol!  A limo came to pick us up from our hotel. We were taken on the little stroll inside The Mansion (mind blown) and into the restaurant. We were stuck in awe of everything. The food was incredible, service was wonderful! At the end of the night, I thought it was only a dream to come back.  The second time around, we knew what we were up against. Armed with more culinary knowledge, we felt at ease while dining. Food wasn't as wonderful as we had remembered, but the first time was our first time having fine dining in general. Nevertheless, food was great and we left satisfied. Even snapped a pic with Chef Claude :)",

    "text": "Don't confuse this with L'Atelier because they are completely 2 different restaurants. If you want to go for ultimate fine dining, this is the place; the other one is more contemporary and casual.  Five years later, I finally realize, how could I have not written a review for JR yet?? I was here summer 2009 but guess what, I still remember my dining experience, because it's THAT memorable. I think this is still my favorite restaurant in the whole world, from food to restaurant decor to service. I really can't find anything to complain about it except for the price, haha!  The decor of the restaurant definitely has a wow factor, from the classy, sophisticated waiting lounge in black and red, transitioning into a royal purple glamour in the dining room as we walked further. The room was embellished with the grandeur of chandeliers hanging from the tall ceiling lighting up the room filled with royal purple suede sofas and chairs. The style is sophisticated, classy and glamorous at the same time without any gaudiness. We were seated in a 2-person table with me on a comfy chair and my friend on the sofa. We decided to do the 3-course prix fixe menu of $89/person (back in 5 years ago). We were greeted with our courteous server and welcomed by a small plate of complimentary Dungeness crab meat topped with sturgeon caviar for each guest! That was quite a delightful surprise to start off our fine meal. :) My friend ordered the sea urchin for her appetizer and I took the crab instead. I still remember how those two appetizers just simply blew our minds away and we couldn't wait for our entrees to arrive. I took the duck confit and seared foie gras which instantly melted in my mouth. I was cutting my food into small bites to savor the decadence for as long as possible. Desserts were truly amazing as we could pick ANYTHING from the patisserie cart, anything from pistachio cake and sumptuous chocolate truffles, anything and however much we wanted! We were so excited to pick one of each and we splitted each small piece in half so we could sample as much as we could.  One thing that made an impression on us was the server's sensitivity toward his surrounding. This is what I call 5-star professional waiting service. The customers do not have to yell or wave their hands to grab attention. The wait staff simply can pick up signals that their customers need something from them! My friend was trying to head to the bathroom but she was on the couch side with the table in her way. Our waiter immediately came to our table to shift it out of her way a little so she could come out. Up till this day, we still talked about this incident, that we were totally impressed by how attentive the servers were! (at least our particular server)   I would go back in a heart beat, only when I have enough savings again... because this experience does come with a big price tag. Expect to pay at least $150 per person, without alcohol. With booze, probably at least $200 per head. But it's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience that you should have when you ball hard in Vegas! It's such an honor to be able to try Robuchon's food finally.  Their prix fixe menus have changed a lot, but I have full confidence that it will be another impeccable experience when I'm there again.  6 stars!",

Eat a light lunch and be prepared for a long meal that's worth the time. It's within a full blown Vegas-style dining environment that showcases world-class modern French fare. Enter through the MGM's villas- arrange to be driven in via one of their gold limos if it's your first time.  You can pay almost as much in Napa, SF, LA, and other places in Vegas but I still haven't found another establishment that has quite matched up. (French Laundry is up there too of course, but it's substantively different in style).",

The staff really pamper their guests.  Once arriving at the restaurant, we were immediately seated on the indoor patio.  It was very secluded as it felt like we were in a garden.  The one thing I noticed about all the servers is that they speak quietly to you.  This enhances the tranquility of the dining experience.  The other people dining are quiet as well.  I ordered a cocktail and it was quite excellent.  It was nice that the bartender used a sphere of ice to keep my drink cool.  This ensured that it would not be watered down during my enjoyment of the beverage.  We decided to each order one of the Prix Fixe options.  After ordering, the bread cart was rolled over and we chose the breads we wanted.  Our dinner was elegantly served and additional bread was brought to us when needed.  After we completed our meals, the sweet cart was rolled over.  We then sampled numerous sweets in addition to the dessert that was included in our meal.  We really enjoyed our dining experience here.  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for an exceptional dining experience.",

My palate is just not that sophisticated for these places to be a place where I have some food where I just want to pick up the plate and lick it clean. The presentation of the food is gorgeous and the bread carts and candy carts are amazing by themselves. I came here on Sept 10, 2013 with my daughter for her birthday. Here is the menu we had that day.(in English)  Cherry Gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice cream  Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella  Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream  Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander  Truffled Langoustine ravioli , Sea-Urchin prepared in \"chaud-froid\" with anise juices spiny lobster served atop spinach leaves in a black Malabar pepper sauce  Light lettuce cream on top of delicate sweet onion custard  Foie gras prepared in a casserole served in a daikon boullion  Pan-fried sea bass with five spices served with verjus sauce  Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment  Broccolini  and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto   Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Rose Champagne cream and soursop sorbet  Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce  They gave us a copy of the menu otherwise I wouldn't have remembered much about the food, it is more the experience of the meal that I enjoy. I liked every thing but I didn't love anything to the point of raving about it. Like I said maybe my palate is just too plebian for these type restaurants but I still like to go there and the bread is always amazing! Service is always perfect and the decor here was so wonderful.

    "text": "DECADENT...is the only way I can describe this experience.  I came here with 2 friends and got the royal treatment. We rolled up to the MGM \"Mansion\" in a gold stretch limo.  Apparently if you stay here they pick you up from the airport in a Rolls Royce (I hear Tiger Woods is a frequent guest). Once through the gates, you honestly feel like VIP (if you didn't already). Then I realized, this would probably be my one and only chance to see what's inside, unless I win the lotto!  We walked through the atrium which was unbelievable!! The gardens were gorgeous and somehow you forgot that it was 100+ degrees outside. We found our way to the \"waiting area\" located inside the mansion and our host picked us up and led us to the restaurant. The rest of our entrance was less glamourous as the route ended up back inside the casino, but all in all the time spent in the Mansion was unreal.  We were one of the first reservations that evening, so it was nice, but a little too quiet at the same time. Eventually the seating did fill up, but it's a little unnerving having everyone there focus their attention on you!  We went with the 6 course prix fixe which was $240/pp. It included everything below...  L'Amuse-bouche  *** Une Entree Appetizer  *** Une Soupe Soup  *** Deux Plats au choix Choice of two Main Courses  *** Fromage  Cheese  *** Dessert   I won't go into detail about every dish that we ate, but here's the advice l can give you.  1. Be careful what you order, because you're meal could end up unbalanced if you order too many of the heavier/richer dishes  2. The chocolate souffle is not even a question. ORDER IT. It's seriously the best souffle that any of us had ever had. It has to be ordered ahead of time and it comes on it's own engraved plate. C'mon, if it has it's own customized dish ware.. you know it's legit!  3. The bread, cheese, and dessert cart are insane. None of us had ever seen anything like it. It can definitely be overwhelming so just take a deep breath, relax, and order one of each! (ok, maybe not on the cheese unless you're a cheese addict)  That said...This was a meal to remember. But more so for the extravagance. If I was being honest, my dinner at the French Laundry still is my fav to this day (and it was less expensive!)  TIP: Go if you want the ultimate boogie experience. You won't be disappointed.",

Winner of three Michelin stars, a prestigious honor only awarded to eleven outstanding restaurants in the United States, a AAA Five diamond award, and a plethora of many other accolades, this dining experience was one of the most memorable of my entire life. From the minute I first set foot in the complimentary gold limo that whisked my husband and I to Joel Robouchon's 'mansion' at MGM to the moment an 'entourage' stood next to our table with a gorgeous Happy Anniversary cake on a gold platter, I felt like a princess and my husband was my prince.   From the magnificent bread cart to the mignardises cart, I was engrossed in a world of gluttony and I wanted to use every bit of will power to convince myself I was not full and could bear the load of just one more helping of bread and bite-sized sweet! The saffron and bacon breads and almond roca were heavenly! I fell in love with the lobster gelee with sugar snap peas. The lobster was phenomenal and the best I have ever tasted in my life! Indeed, an esthetically stunning and succulent culinary creation! I've heard rumors that some plates can take several staff members meticulously working together for twenty minutes to plate and now that I have dined here, I can attest that rumor is most likely True! Every plate begins as a clean canvas and is executed beautifully and immaculately 'orchestrated'--each item has its own particular place and purpose. The beef cheeks were incredibly tender and I detest mashed potatoes, but I devoured every bit of that buttery potato goodness! We ordered the three and four course menus and were plenty full.  My only complaint is the background of the flickering slot machines in the MGM casino area, which unfortunately, is visible from the dining area. However, avoiding eye contact with such distractions proved to be an easy feat as the restaurant had many exquisite interiors to distract my wondering eyes--a gorgeous crystal chandelier, which we were told take many people to clean by hand, artistic food creations, personal photos of the Robouchon family, luxurious interiors of purple velvet and silver, and spectacular floral displays. The homemade marshmallow gift was anticlimactic, considering the all the other grandiose details. I was disappointed that I did not receive a copy of the menu as a keepsake of my bucket list experience. I suppose a copy of the menu was only given to people who ordered from the sixteen course degustation menu. I suppose I should be thankful that I received a booklet of beautiful photos of the restaurant, but I secretly desired a menu to remember the composition of each creation. We probably will never dine here again due to the steep price tag, but it was a truly splendid experience that we will never forget!",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. It was quite a wonderful dining experience and definitely memorable. I wasn't sure what to expect at the time since it was a surprise and I think for the most part joel robuchon was a pretty decent experience.  Upon entering the restaurant I felt as though it was a very upscale environment with a quiet serene atmosphere. We were seated at one of the corner tables which was a great view of the restaurant. Our server was kind, soft spoken and informative. Now on to the food.  There was quite a selection of breads to choose from but to me tasted alright. Though the way the salted butter was brought to us was executed in such a smooth way and tasted amazing with the bread. Also, thought it was weird that they only heated it up the first time they gave it to us. Better to not at all or always do I feel.  It was a very long and slow dinner probably spent over 3 hours there, but I had great company to share the experience with. We've been to many Michelin star places and understand the concept of enjoying a long leisurely dinner but not sure if the pacing was done very well here. We spent a lot of time in between each course just sitting there waiting. The main entrees and appetizers were good but not sure if the food really matches up to its prices. I can't remember much courses from the dinner that stood out like I usually do when I dine somewhere nice like this so I guess it was mostly mediocre to me. The only thing that I remembered was the birthday cake which I will explain.  The dessert selection was exciting, I am an adventurous eater and wanted to choose everything on the cart but felt bad when I was already picking out my 6th and 7th choices.  I think what really threw me off the most was the birthday cake. My boyfriend had paid 30$ extra for their specially made birthday cake for me. Don't get me wrong that was probably the best cake I have ever eaten in my life it was so delicious and presented very well. I still dream about the taste...Which is why I was really irritated and sad with the fact that they gave us each a tiny slice after presenting it to us and for some reason brought the cake back into the kitchen. The cake itself is pretty small so it's not like we wouldn't have been able to finish it or anything but it seemed like that was all that they were planning on giving us. 2 little slices worth 30$. I asked if we could have more of our cake and they said of course and brought out only another 2 tiny slices. I almost felt bad asking for more because I got the feeling that I wasn't doing the right thing! Just why?! Why couldn't you just leave the cake there on our table?! Were they planning on feeding the last few bites to the staff? Were they going to throw it away? WHY?! I still would love to know the answer. I felt that way a couple times throughout the meal with the bread cart and the dessert cart too as if I was being judged for asking for more. I'm pretty sure there wasn't much of the cake left so I just really don't understand why they insisted on keeping the cake from us !!!   Anyways it was an experience overall, but damn that was a crazy bill! Prices probably jacked up just cause it's vegas but would go back to get some more of that cake, if they'll let me have the whole thing..",

    "text": "This review is for my visit on July 12th 2014 to celebrate my wedding anniversary.    Service:  the service overall was good but nothing special.  I would expect top notch service at a 3 star Michelin restaurant at this caliber.  however, I do have a complaint, the restaurant should offer dark linen for guests wearing dark clothing and white linen for guests wearing lighter color clothing.  I've seen this done at some of the restaurants in LA and I really appreciated the attention to detail down to the color of the linen.  I definitely don't want to get white lint stuck on my black dress or suit.  Secondly, the waiter's and waitress's attire is a little outdated ( especially the waiter's suits don't seem to fit very well and are very old fashion).  Although what they wear really has nothing to do with my meal or the service that I receive, I just think their outfit needs to match the whole posh/chic/upscale atmosphere. Finally, because we were there for our anniversary , my husband had ordered a special celebratory cake for us to share.  The waiter brought the cake out on a nicely decorated tray with a pretty sugar piece and a sign that says \" happy anniversary.\"   the issue here is that he brought it out and left so quickly I didn't even get a chance to take a pic of it.  He quickly showed it to me, then turned it over to show it to my husband and that was that.  Didn't offer to wait for me to take a picture of the whole tray.  The whole experience with the tray felt very very rushed.  We each got a slice of the cake and in my mind, I thought I get to take the rest of the cake home.  but I guess not, cuz they didn't pack the rest for us.  Food: The food was Ok.  I've had better.  Like the previous reviewer had stated, if you're in LA, you'll probably enjoy Melisse more.  We ended up spending more than we should have.  I was not impressed with the food.  we had the 5 course tasting menu but we get to try more than 5 courses because my husband and I chose different things on the menu ( you get to choose 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert from a list).  so in actuality, I get to try 10 different items that night, and NONE impressed me.  I  thought the food was either too salty or too bland.  Most of the dishes had similar jelly type of consistency.  even the soup had a weird thick consistency that I don't care for.  everyone on here complimented on the bread cart.  but I don't think it's worth it to spend a sh'tload of money just to chow down on the breads.  there were 8 choices of bread to choose from.  I tasted every one of them based on the views on here but I find them nothing special.  you can get really good bread elsewhere and pay a fraction of the price.  They also have a mini dessert cart to end your meal.  Ok, anyone that knows me , know that I have a sweet tooth and I know my desserts...BUT the dessert cart had nothing that I really like.  the macarons were just OK ( Lette's or Bottega Louie is WAY better).  mini operas and cupcakes were BLEH...gosh it was the most pathetic dessert cart I've ever seen in my entire career of eating sweets.  Last words:  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  if you're in LA, try Melisse or Providence.  Both are really really good and local! I think they should downgrade this restaurant to a 1 star or a no star restaurant.",

Only thing I remember was they decorated our table top with bunch of stones and our waiters were busy to organize these stones. I guest these were decoration and performance, but it looked a little stupid. We spent $1.5K range of the price for two.  I have been to Joel Robuchon restaurant in Tokyo a few times and I was a fan of their foods. They also have some bakeries and I really love them. I expected the same level of taste so.... Disappointed!",

We did the $425 degustation menu, which for our (large) party was actually only a 12-course dinner and not 16 as is advertised on the website. It was definitely a very well planned meal with plates and silver ware complementing every dish. Leave no sauce or garnish untouched because they are all part of the overall flavor.  Maybe my palate isn't sophisticated enough, but past a $250 tasting menu, every additional dollar adds marginal quality to the meal.",

I'm not too high on French in general.  I am most impressed by their appetizers the most, their osetra caviar, the way they arrange their plates and the selection of the bread. 5.  I can't say this is worth 4 times a normal $40 dinner.  I would say about 2-3 times.  Personally, I would eat a 4lb lobster at Newport Restaurant in LA for $80.  However, I'd probably take a girl here if I were to propose and had no original ideas, haha.  No, it is a fine restaurant.  I just can't afford it yet.",

The second time, however, there were several service miscues, such as failure to fold my napkin when I went to the restroom, taking 10 minutes to bring the check, failure to say thank you upon leaving the restaurant, etc.  I will say that the food is excellent, with the crab salad, lobster, uni spaghetti, and langoustine ravioli being the stars of the show.  Highly recommended for the food but service is hit or miss.  The first time I went, the service was impeccable, warmer than French Laundry and second only to L'Arnsbourg in Baerenthal, France.",

From the ridiculous carts of bread and mignardises, to the over the top amuse of caviar and crab... everything was absolutely wonderful. Amazing that a dining experience like this is literally 10 steps away from the cigarette smoke, glitter, and \"glamour\" of the MGM casino.   Favorites on the night I dined:  Les Champignons - Crispy toast topped with black truffles, trembling parsley chicken royal w/ gold leaf, and ginger matsutake tea w/ black truffles  La Chataigne - Delicate chestnut veloute with foie gras, smoked lardons foam  Les Crustaces - Langoustine in a filo crust, Uni on mashed potato with roasted coffee beans, Roast Lobster tail w/ lemongrass   La Sphere de Sucre (which was requested, not on menu) - Sugar sphere filled with mascarpone mousse, Limoncello marshmallow, and a stratification of surprises from childhood",

    "text": "If we had not dined at E by Jose Andres the night before we ate here, the star rating would probably have been a four. The 26 course tasting menu at E is half the price of the 17 course meal here at Joel Robuchon. Further, the quality of the food is just as good (if not better) at E than at Joel Robuchon.  If you are looking for an amazing experience, skip Joel Robuchon and go to E by Jose Andres instead.   All in all, JR was good. My scale is based on value which is quality of food for the price. This would be 3-4 stars in my opinion. Nothing knocked our socks off except the bill (which we knew what we were getting in to).   However, I don't know how this place is a 3 michellin star restaurant. The service really was not that good. It was better than a fine steak house, but it definitely was not 3 michellin star service. Simple examples: napkins weren't folded when we left the table for the restroom. Crumbs weren't wiped from the table between courses. My wifes plates weren't always served first or cleared first. Also, the head hospitality server got into a little verbal tussle with one of the runners in front of us. It wasn't quite an argument, but enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Its the small things like this that they need to work on. I have eaten at 1 michelin star restaurants with better service.   Bottle of decent wine, two glasses of wine and the tasting menu for two put us at $1650. Very underwhelming experience.",

While waiting, our host went on to say that the souffle would take some time and that he \"threw in\" a couple of extra desserts for us. Sounded like a nice gesture.  Next thing we know, 4 additional very intricate fancy desserts we had never heard of before were being brought out to us along with an over the top presentation and explanation of what they were.  Everything was great, but not what we asked for or ordered.  Then the bill comes.  $84 bill for a $25 dessert we originally came for.

Even though a 3-Star Michellin award rating far surpasses my 5-star woohoo, you still deserve all the stars in the world because of the once-in-a-lifetime experience you've given me...  A quick break-down: 1. Complimentary limo pick-up to/from our hotel 2. Entering the \"Mansion\" from a private entrance 3. Hostess waiting to greet us as we arrived 4. Walking inside the Mansion villas and private quarters 5. Hostess giving us a mini tour as we entered into the restaurant 6. Restaurant decor & ambiance 7.

Unforgettable 4-hour dining experience  I'm still awestruck about this place. A 4-hour dining experience, a 16-course meal p/person... you can't get anything like this anywhere else!

One is French Laundry in Yountville whose 2-month advance reservation requirement is just as famous as the actual cuisine served once you get there.   The other as of the last Vegas Michelin guide, is Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas, NV.   We booked a week in advance and had no trouble getting a reservation. But then again we were also flying into Sin City on Easter weekend, so that may have played a part.   The experience was absolutely incredible. The dining area was decorated by rich royal purple drapes, crisp white dinnercloth, and pale pink hues. Each table had a green birdcage as centerpiece paired by two tall electric tapered candles on either side. The huge arrangement of pale pink roses were real and lent a light sweet fragrance to the air.   Only here would they use caviar as an amuse-bouche. Shaved black truffles were generously used. Flavors were clean but bolder than some might be used to. I was delighted that butter and cream were used sparingly, and surprised at how combinations like sole over oyster and leek ravioli could actually come together as a cohesive whole. Everything was cooked to perfection. I could write whole pages on this but instead I've uploaded 15+ pictures to save everyone some time.   On top of that, the service was astounding.   Everyone was very professional and polite but simultaneously made us feel completely at ease. No pretentiousness here. They didn't bat an eye when we chose smaller dinner sets over their grand tasting menu. For the famous bread carts (filled with 12+ goodies like a basil brioche that tasted like fresh pesto, baguettes, loaves, milk buns, and little rolls infused with saffron and rosemary) they kept on gently encouraging for us to pick and explore more. \"Is there anything else you'd like to try?\". We ended up trying every single one.   This was only to be repeated for the cheese tasting. Although only my friend's dinner included it, they automatically brought share plates and didn't mind my mooching a little taste here and there from his selection. \"Is this too modest a slice for you?\" the server asked genuinely as he cut little wedges from each round my friend excitedly pointed at.   The dessert cart complete with miniature truffles, cakes, fresh marshmallows, cookies, even homemade lollipops only sealed the deal from there. They even gave me a cute little box of marshmallows to take home in a small black and purple box wrapped with ribbon.   Save for the trip, it's worth every penny.",

    "text": "Went here on Christmas eve for a special celebration. Like most, I was excited to go to first 3 Michelin star restaurant. Was expected to be blown away by food and service and ambience. So not the case.  Food  Everything was good but not great. Many of the delicious were mono-texture. Soft soft and more soft. No crunch no texture. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong dish but how many types of gelee and you put in your dish?  Food temperature was good but not great.   Famous Robuchon potatoes are delicious. Perfectly smooth and creamy. I think it should be called Robuchon butter served with a hint of potato.  Bread and desert cart were awesome! What does that tell you when I remember the bread cart more than the meal. I could probably just eat the bread cart all night. You pick and choose your bread and then it is returned perfectly warm to mealt the smooth butter. But when you ask for seconds it comes back cold? Ok why heat the first batch and then just give me the second batch right off the cart? Which leads me to the next category....  Service  Michelin star rating is based on food and service they go hand in hand right? Wrong. We were seated, I went to the restroom. When I returned the host had dropped off the menu to the only guest at the table and left. No intro no explanation no welcome. Nada!  The tablecloth had a big stain. Yes, a nasty chocolate like dish had smeared into the top fishnet pattern cloth so there was pieces of a meal embedded in the intersticies. Wow someone wasn't paying attention.  I should have asked for the special limo and come in via the Mansion but were running late and had to get to a show.   Tips  When the waiter asks you for water expect to pay $10-20 a pop on the bill.  Don't bother asking for the a la carte menu unless you want to pay $200 for an entree dish.   You get a delicious piece of dark chocolate to go home with.   My wife has gone to Per se (3 Michelin) and I have been to Coi (2 Michelin) and countless 1 Michelin star restaurants (Michael Mina, Gary Danko, Village Pub, Quince) and Robuchon is at the bottom of the list in terms of food, service and value.   Next stop... the French Laundry.",

    "text": "An amazing evening of decadent dining!  I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars (Perhaps I've just been spoiled by fabulous dining experiences while living in NYC.)    It all begins with a ride in the MGM gold limo, transporting you in style from your hotel to the private entrance of The Mansion.  From there you're escorted by the hostess through the Mansion and the casino to the restaurant. I thought it was richly decorated in rich purples, pale pinks, with green birdcages and (fake) flowers everywhere - though the decor might be too much for some.  You're seated on dark purple couches and even have a stool for your fabulous handbag.   On to the food!  We started with a glass of champagne ($45 each, yikes!  Though definitely the best champagne my taste buds have ever experienced).  The amuse bouche was caviar, crab, and creme fraiche. Yum - a perfect compliment to the champagne.  My husband and I both had the two course $135/person menu with appetizer, soup, entree, and dessert.  The perfect amount of food (though I had starved myself that day in preparation).  You get your choice(s) of bread from a vast selection (of 20+!) off their bread cart.  The gruyere brioche was my favorite (of the 5 that I tried).  And they kept coming back offering more -- but be sure you save room for the rest of your meal!  For appetizer, I had the salmon tartare with shiso sprouts and caviar (another perfect compliment to the champagne) -- which was better than my husband's king crab salad.  For soup, I had the green pea cream (with bits of ham, mmm...).  Good, but nothing could compare to the truffled onion soup we had at Fleur de Lys.  For our entrees, I had the spiny lobster and my husband had the spring lamb.  Delicious flavors, but not the best we'd had of either.  The spiny lobster was subtly flavored with coral and radish shavings, but I couldn't help comparing it to better spiny lobster I've had in Turks & Caicos.  The quality of the lamb was world class, but the dry mediterranean rub was a bit too citrus-y for my husband's taste.  These, however, were accompanied by creamy mashed potatoes - the ultimate mashed potatoes, tasted like pure butter, only better.  For dessert, we both had the chocolate with coffee ice cream and caramelized puffed rice.  But wait, there's more... Ending the meal with french press coffee, they then roll out a dessert cart filled with an eye-popping selection of tiny desserts.  Each beautifully decorated and equally as delicious.  I chose 7 on my first go around, then went on to eat 5 more of my husband's selections.  Luckily, I still had more room to go, and the waiter brought back another 10 for me!  Hazelnut chocolate, pistacchio with ginger, strawberry cheesecake in milk chocolate, blueberry infused with lavender, five spice petit four... every one a dessert lover's dream!!  As if that wasn't enough, they give the ladies a boxed gift of their strawberry marshmellow candy that I'm still savoring.    And of course, the service was impeccable.    Overall a fantastic dining experience - just be sure you're ready to foot the $$$$$$ bill at the end of the meal.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Joel Robuchon...a huge disappointment.  The first experience, for our anniversary on 9/13 was extraordinarily magnificent (5 stars plus). Everything was perfection, from the gold limousine upon pickup and the best appetizer I have ever eaten of perfectly fried egg on crispy potato topped with caviar to the surprise anniversary cake after dessert was served. We walked away as if we were royalty. The second visit was nothing like the first. It could've been a different restaurant entirely. We went for my sweethearts' birthday on 1/29 of this year. The staff seemed somewhat out of sorts as we could not find our server when we needed to order more wine and finally just asked the busboy to get it when we flagged him down. The egg appetizer did not have caviar and tasted nothing like my previous. When the served the entree, they presented the chicken to me, which In fact was not my entree. The server looked upset and put it back on the tray behind me where we watched it sit for 10 minutes getting cold until they got it sorted out. There was also (no fault of the restaurant just added made more unpleasant) a couple behind us fighting and the man was getting obstreperous and accusing his wife of cheating. Back to the dinner...upon making the reservation I told them of the birthday and there was no acknowledgment, no cake, not even a candle in the souffle.  At the end of the meal I asked for the check and the limo to take us back as we were more than ready to leave. After I paid I was told the limo was busy and it would take 20 minutes. It took more than 35. In the interim I requested another car or cab be called so we could return to our hotel and she kept saying that the limo was almost there. All in all it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Lesson...do not have expectations of consistency even from the likes of Joel Robuchon. So very disappointing.",

But nothing - nothing - I ate blew me away, and I certainly did not leave feeling like the nearly $700 bill for the two of us was close to worthwhile.  I will also add that my experience was very tainted by the fact that the moment we sat down, before we were given a wine list or cocktail menu, we were offered a glass of champagne.  Obviously we should not have accepted without requesting the menu first, but I was shocked to find that they automatically served us $45/glass Veuve without ever telling us that was what we were drinking or hinting at the price.   Nor was my husband informed that the tiny vegetable starter he ordered had a $50 surcharge when they asked him if he wanted to add bone marrow to it. I realize that for some people who dine at JR, money is no object.  And although we went there expecting to spend a lot, I did not feel that it was well spent.  (I will add that when we questioned the bone marrow surcharge, it was graciously removed from the bill.  We did not say anything about the Veuve but I  suppose I was still in too much shock.)",

    "text": "How can I explain that coming here is always a pleasure.  This was my 2nd dining experience here.  Not as lucky this time to actually get to meet Mr Robuchon himself on our 1st visit.  But nonetheless it was fantastic.  Our group of 4 ordered the Tasting Menu...and discovered that we were absolutely filled to the top.  We enjoyed each dish for its presentation and beauty.  And then for their taste, of course.  The most memorable at this moment was the artistic beauty of the dessert.  It was a mini garden in a glass with sugar butterflies on the outside!!!  Almost couldn't eat it!  I'd be careful when ordering here.  If you are hungry and really want to chomp down on FOOD, then you should order individual dishes to get a bigger bite of the dish you KNOW you'll like to taste in contrast to the tasting menu where you WILL get full.  However, each flavor is only a morsel of that dish.  So order the full version if you are hungry!  ...so just take the plunge and splurge once in a lifetime when you are visiting Vegas!!",

    "text": "Las Vegas is filled with celebrity chefs and Michelin starred restaurants. The problem is the Vegas chains of their namesakes are often poor imitations.  I've heard the conspiracy theories about all food comes from a single provider (and how the fancy places have exactly the same ingredients as all of the cheaper restaurants).  I've been super disappointed with most of the fancy places I've been to in Las Vegas.  My wife insisted going to Joel Robuchon during this trip, and I was a bit worried because of the other experiences I've had in Las Vegas.  I'm not kidding when I say this meal cost more than my first car. The tip on this meal by itself was more than almost any fancy Vegas restaurant meal for 2 (with drinks). ...so this place is NOT cheap...  The menu had the tasting menu and then some other options.  My advice is to get the tasting menu. It was $445 per person (not including tax and tip).  The meal will take a while and it last for hours (so it totally counts as dinner and a show - so you're going into the evening saving $400 on VIP tickets to some show elsewhere and that's something).  The 18 course meal was amazing. It was a lot of food, but the timing of the courses was perfect.  I wish some of the courses came with a little instruction on how they need to be eaten.  Most of the celebrity or Michelin starred restaurants in Las Vegas generally get 1 or 2 stars for their Yelp reviews from me...seriously most of the celebrity chef places in Vegas are awful.  After our meal we ranked it compared to other similar meals we've had. In this case we compared our meal to the tasting menu at Pierre Gagnaire in Tokyo. Pierre Gagnaire was without a doubt the best meal I've ever had. And, after our meal here Pierre Gagnaire Tokyo still is the best meal, but it is still amazing and worth the price.  So if you are in Las Vegas and have a lot of money burning a hole in your pocket this is an excellent option. As a bonus the tasting menu for 2 will almost give almost enough points for Pearl Mlife status.",

Now this is NOT to say that the food is bad. It is not bad. But a meal here costs $1,000 (at least). This did not taste like a $1,000 meal. This was not a Michelin-quality experience.

Every bite is so balanced and so powerful at the same time. Tbh, the part I enjoyed the most isn't from any of the 17 courses. The bread cart is my favorite. It features more than 10 varieties. Luckily, they made them so small that you can try as much as you want. The other impressive course is the complimentary birthday cake. It came with out last trio of coffee themed desserts. The cake is made with mango sorbet, ice cream and meringue. The sweet and tart are so balance. I think it is the fact that I didn't have high expectation on the free cake added a lot onto the WOW factor. I would totally finish the whole cake if this is my first dish!! I have dined at couple Michelin three stared restaurants. I am usually too lazy to leave a review. But this place is too good that I have to share.",

    "text": "Best birthday gift EVER.   It's been a few days since my visit to JR and I haven't stopped thinking about it. I went with the 17 course Degustation Menu.   There wasn't a single item on any dish that I didn't absolutely love. The first course after the amuse was incredible. Le Caviar Imperial. As my server took the empty plate away he told me, \"It gets better...\" and he was right.   I won't go into detail about each dish but I'll just say that every bite of this tasting was heavenly. There wasn't a single item on any dish that I didn't love. The flavors and textures were out of this world, yet delicate. Definitely a meal you'll want to eat slowly so you can enjoy the subtleties and complexities of the dishes.   The restaurant itself is beautiful. It just oozes luxury. The decor, the furniture, the dishes, glassware, serving utensils, everything. The ambiance is quiet and romantic but well-lit and energetic.   Before I comment on the service, here's a little context: This was my first time dining at a place this formal. This was my first time (since I was a kid dining with my mom) dining at a French restaurant. I frequent high-end celebrity chef restaurants but this was definitely the first time dining at THIS price point. I was a little nervous that I'd go in and be the weird, awkward solo diner who doesn't know how to use the caviar spoon (this happened, actually) and can't pronounce anything on the menu (this also happened). I was sure that the staff would be pretentious and that I'd be lost. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong...  The entire staff was incredible. The host was sweet and sat me immediately. All the different servers were informative and helpful, took the time to chat with me and made absolute sure that felt comfortable and welcome. The person who really went above and beyond was Kit. Because of Kit, I had the BEST time. Not one person was pretentious or cold. Every staff member was kind, warm, attentive, and they really made me feel at home. For this, I am so grateful. Also, they gave me a tour of the kitchen. It's just as beautiful back there. I imagined it would be chaos back there but it was calm, organized, immaculate, and everyone looked like they loved their work.   The food here is incredible, no question. But the staff-- they are what makes this place worth every penny. It was so impressive to see so many people working together so beautifully. It was like watching the ballet. You know they're busting their butts but they are doing it so elegantly.  I can't WAIT to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Wow, this place was nice... we made a reservation during the weekday for dinner, and the place was absolutely empty when we arrived - so they actually let us pick almost anywhere to sit. We opted for one of the tables on the side of the patio (with a bench), in the atrium area. The area is absolutely beautiful, makes you feel like you're in a garden. I was surprised at how low the tables were (or how high the benches were). I'm a pretty small person, and I barely had enough room for my thighs to fit underneath the table. We were immediately given a menu and they actually brought a little footstool for my friend to put her purse on (mine just went right beside me on the bench).  We opted for one of the meal sets where you get to pick a series of dishes. Before the courses came out, we made the naive mistake of getting a little too excited by the bread cart and filling up on bread. However, I have to say, that focaccia was probably the best I've ever had in my life, so no regrets there.   Our dishes included la langoustine, le homard du maine, le veau, salmon with caviar, the souffle, and a few others I can't remember the name of (seems like they often change their menu, too). The salmon with caviar and the souffle were the highlight of the menu. I wanted to opt for a steak but the waiter convinced me to get the beef cheeks (I regret that).   The service was ridiculously attentive, we were probably served by about 5-10 different staff members and even though we were the only ones seated in the atrium, someone came to peek in/check on us about every 30 seconds. The dishes were small in size, but by the time the last one had come out I was positively stuffed. Definitely not a restaurant I'd frequent (since it's so expensive) but was quite a nice treat.",

Have you ever had a cart wheel to you with every imaginable cake and candy you can fathom? Welcome to Joel Rubucheon!  First visit to a Michelin Star winning restaurant. Do not make the mistake to think this is just a great restaurant. JR is truly a spectacular culinary experience! Every move once you step foot into the restaurant is an entirely different adventure. You were greeted by not one, but several servers who are dedicated to serving your every need. Best way to describe this experience is similar to a dream where everything goes your way taste incredible and the imagery is spectacular! This experience can be a little overwhelming, so I don't feel shy about asking the servers any question you would like to know they are here to help and really focus on creating the very best patron experience!",

All was fab!!! Amuse, bread cart (cutest bread in the world!), the butter, all the courses!!! The butter!!! Mignardies cart!!! We savored everything! Service was friendly, not stuffy at all. We were fully stuffed but not overly stuffed to the point we need to stop eating and halt the menu. We got a little Citrus pound cake as a take away. We ate it two days later and it was still amazing! If I had to critique anything, it would be the croissants were too light in color, but super cute as they may have been 15-20 grams. Also our reservation was quite late, like 9:30. I didn't know there was a champagne lounge we could have had a glass at prior to our meal, rather than waiting in our room. When in Vegas, the hubby and I will definitely be back.",

The place is very small and the ambiance is very professional and serious. I went with my girlfriend and another couple and we all look like we're in our early 20's so I kind of got a vibe that they were very cold and short towards us, which was annoying. I've been to plenty other fine dining restaurants and I rarely get these vibes. One of the lady actually explained the food wrong to us too..   The food itself, all 17 courses, I got more \"hmm wow this is very interesting and pretty good\" than \"OMG this is amazing\" which I don't think should be that way. Especially if it's a 3 Michelin Star restaurant at $500+ per head. Every dish should have a pop and be like WOW, but it wasn't.  Overall, I would recommend it for the experience but I probably won't be going back again until I'm super balling and look older.",

So far all this time I gambled, i have lost :(   Anyways, if visiting Vegas i had to go big or go hime right? So here i am:  *Ambience: When walking towards the restaurant, i saw L'atelier by Joel Robuchon and i was sooo dissatisfying, it looked like a bar and i just kept thinking how overdressed i was... However, my hostess told me i was in the wrong spot and took me to the real deal. Its super nice and elegant inside!  *Service: i cant count how many waiters i had: sommelier, one that took my order, one that brought my water, one that brought the bread, etc. All of them super nice and friendly, some of them had a nice accent and that's always a plus!  *Food: OMG! The food was so good that if i ever die i would come here everyday as a ghost at least to smell or see the food!!  Overall, i will come back! :)",

    "text": "People could be moved by movies, music and books and as a normal human being, most people had experience of being moved by all of them. For myself, as a classical music lover, I remember I was moved by orchestra many times in the concert hall by myself. Sometimes it's because it was well performed and reminded me my girlfriend during the music since she also love classical music though we are doing long distance. I know lots of people can't understand classical music and I do believe more people have good taste of food. However, it's absurd that some one was touched after having a delicious meal. But I am going to tell you it could happen, only in Joel Robuchon restaurant.  The first time that I've heard about the name Joel Robuchon is in the documentary \"Jiro Dreams of sushi\", which is a biography of the famous Japanese sushi maker, Jiro Ono ( )who has one of the best and Michelin 3 star sushi restaurant in Japan. In the movie, he asked how can I make delicious food. First of all, my taste has to be more sensitive than the customer's. If my taste could be as sensitive as Joel Robuchon, I could definitely make more delicious dishes. After that, Joel Robuchon's image lingered in my mind and really want to have a chance to visit it. The first time but also the last time I went is this March. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time at Joel Robuchon l'Atelier in Shanghai.   Then until yesterday I had another chance to visit his restaurant in Las Vegas.  I went to the Joel Robuchon Las Vegas, the only 2016 Michelin 3 stars of all the restaurants in this city, to celebrate my friend's birthday. In short, everything was just amazing and beautiful. After the main courses and when I got to the dessert, something unexpected happened. The desert was a purple ball and with the melting shell of it, it suddenly brought my memories of having dessert with my girlfriend at the Joel Robuchon l'Atelier in Shanghai back to me. And at the same time all the memories about we having different desert together appeared in front of my mind (Both of us love desert.) Then I was truly moved by delicious food and tears welled up in my eyes. Since I am the only gentlemen of the whole table, I have to control myself and try to keep smiling.  I can't believe this could happen but then I rejected my thought.  This is just my real perception of his food which is unique, tasty and beautiful. Also he's a maestro in culinary industry, just like pianist Debussy or painter Monet (And they are all French). It should not be  too surprise that I was moved by him.   Then I started to think I should definitely visit him in the future since I was obsessed and amazed by his cuisine. I will fly to anywhere if I can have chance to experience the food which was cooked by himself and tell him how amazing it is, just like me flying for the concert performed by legendary pianists. And his creation of food brought me and people all over the world so many wonderful memories.   Unfortunately, God played a joke on us. It's really a joke.   I woke up this morning and found that Joel Robuchon had just passed away, at age 73. I felt sad about him and the world lost another True master. But life is just like that.   R.I.P. Joel Robuchon, and thank you very much. It's time for God to experience his cooking.",

    "text": "First off, RIP Joel Robuchon. What a sincere and profound loss. :(   I had the good fortune of trying Joel Robuchon for the first time for my birthday weekend. It's not for the light of heart in both it's cost and extravagance. But boy, if you're ready to go all out, there really isn't any better place to do it at.  Pros: +Let's first talk about presentation, decor and design. Although from the outside, it may look fairly normal in a busy, busy hotel, come inside and you're greeted to an extravagant mansion with it's own little patio to a fake evening in the French countryside. It's quiet, gorgeous and classy. The service (I'm so, so sorry I forgot your name awesome UNLV server) was so on-point and patient with us and fun to chat with.  +They were super nice to give us a full birthday cake with a candle to blow out and a generous slice of said cake (what happened to the rest of the cake I'm a bit curious about) and it was delicious. An icy coconut mango cake that was delicious through and through.  +Obviously, let's talk food. We both went for an iteration on Menu A which will run you about $150-$200 per person depending on the items you're getting and not counting supplementary costs. The food presentation is gorgeous. Well-presented; beautiful works of art. We had a black forest dessert for instance that not only was delicious but came in a half cut wine glass and looked like a tiny mushroom forest. Wacky and fascinating. We also had the uni caviar pasta. The uni was excellent and mixed well with the caviar. The ravioli was surprisingly cold yet so delicious as well. Just a burst of flavor (make sure to keep it all in one piece). The bread and dessert carts by the way are amazing-balls. They just straight up come with an epic cart of so many carbs and so many variations. They were amazing to say the least from rolls, to croissants to macarons to cake pops. Yum yum yum!  Observations: +/- Even though we didn't do the epic 10-course meal and even though we were told that it shouldn't take three hours, both of us doing the 'Menu A' took about 3 hours. Make sure to factor it into your night if you have somewhere to be and just be mindful of the time if you need to hurry something along.   Cons:  -Not all the dishes resonated with me admittedly. We had a banana pudding dessert that was oddly lacking much in terms of texture and flavor. Gazpacho personally is just never my thing so no fault of the restaurant but just wanted to mention that this one didn't convince me otherwise that I was a fan. I also did like parts of the jamon dish although wish there was more of the rice and egg in the middle. It ended up being cool to look at but underwhelming in terms of an entree.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is an upscale French restaurant chain that has been in the USA for 30 years but only in Las Vegas for 14 years.  As you check in for your reservation, the hostess lets you know that they offer complimentary coat check in the lounge. After passing by the lounge, you see the dessert cart in the lobby way on the left and then, the bread cart in the dining room on the right. The dining room had a nice floral display in the center.   Most of my party ordered alcoholic beverages - wine, champagne, and cocktail (Hemingway). I ordered the Royal Flush, which consisted of a blend of cranberry juice, orange juice, and ginger beer served over the rocks. It was light, refreshing, and bubbly.  When it came to ordering, you had a choice of a prix fixe menu option (4-course, 3-course, 2-course) or al carte. With prix fixe menu, you had to option to add appetizers, entrees, desserts, and beverages for additional fee. Most of us went with a 2-course meal of either an appetizer and entree or an entree and a dessert. All meals started with Amuse-Bouche (Le Caviar), bread cart, and then, desserts cart.   The Amuse-Bouche consisted of daikon puree, osetra caviar over creme fraiche, daikon, and gelee. The croquette consisted of quinoa, sesame seeds, and spices.   The Bread Cart consisted of freshly baked cheese brioche, cheesy bread, milk bread, brioche with rosemary, roulette, croissant, and bread with bacon bits, baguette, and more. I loved the baked cheese brioche, cheesy bread, milk bread, and roulette. The bread was served with curled butter topped with sea salt and EVOO.  For appetizers, I ordered L'Avocat, which consisted of two cannelloni of avocado stuffed with Scottish Salmon confit and served with osetra caviar over creme fraiche. I tried the La Betterave, which consisted of a spiced diced beetroot and apple topped with green mustard sorbet and young shoots of herbs. I didn't like the taste or how spicy it was. I also tried the Le Homard Du Maine, which consisted of Maine lobster in a thinly sliced turnip with sweet and sour dressing. Being a fan of sour things, I loved the pickled turnip.  For main course, I ordered the Le Saints Pierre, which consisted of John Dory Fish Fillet served over over a delicate squid ink risotto and topped with crispy green shiso leaf tempura. I tried the Le Boeuf, which consisted of  grilled beef ribeye cooked to perfection and served with thin crispy mushroom ravioli and greens. I also tried the Le Black Cod, which consisted of caramelized black cod in malaise pepper sauce and served with bok choy. All of these main courses came with their signature mashed potatoes.  For dessert, I tried the Le Litchi, which consisted of lychee sorbet and raspberry coulis topped with lemon poppy foam and served in a double walled glass dish in a metal holder. I'd highly recommend this light and delicate dessert. I also tried the Le Souffle, which consisted of a piping hot bitter chocolate souffle. I didn't enjoy this as much as the pistachio souffle at L'Atelier De Joel Robuchon as it was too heavy.  From the dessert cart, I picked 17 items including (1) Apple Tart, (2) Orange Chocolate, (3) Raspberry Pistachio Tart, (4) Lemon Meringue Tart, (5) Coffee Cake, (6) Pistachio Macaron, (7) Lime Jelly, (8) Hazelnut Opera Cake, (9) Raspberry Cheesecake, (10) Raspberry Chocolate, (11) Passionfruit Macaron, (12) Red Raspberry Chocolate, (13) Lemon Tart with Coconut, (14) Raspberry Jello, (15) Panna Cotta (Yuzu), (16) Cream Stuffed Doughnut Soaked in Rum, (17) Ginger Scented Creme Brulee. The last three came from the kitchen. I liked everything except the Cream Stuffed Doughnut Soaked in Rum.",

From the moment we sat down, we felt like royalty and you get the sense every single server amd employee of the restaurant truly cared about giving you THE best experience.  The GM also came by numerous times to ensure we were having a good time - this was a special touch.  We will absolutely be back!",

Just the bread service alone is something to be remarked upon.  I have not seen so many varieties in a single setting and was not surprised to learn that they have their own bakery.  The sommelier was polite and knowledgeable and the overall service impeccable.  One has to wonder why the restaurant does not move to a better hotel on the strip.  The MGM Grand does not seem like the right fit for a restaurant of this class.",

One thing I expect is to actually get all the stupid courses in something resembling a reasonable amount of time.   So I figured let's assume every course takes about 10 minutes. That's about a 3 hour meal. No problem.  So everything starts out great. We get our first course and our wine pairing.  This goes on smoothly for the next 4 courses -- one dish is taken away and another replaces it nearly immediately. Super!  Then all of a sudden I see a group of - I have no idea really how many but it seemed like 50-100 people pass by and get seated somewhere in the back.  And guess what? The food stops coming out. It turns into a twenty minute wait in-between each course. So we eat our little tiny bite, drink our little glass of wine and wait and wait. Nothing to drink, nothing to eat. So then we end up ordering a bottle of wine just to have something to do while we are waiting.  This went on for the most painfully long-time I can't even describe. We never did get all our courses.   Frustrating -- you would at least think they would say something or comp something or do anything but no such luck.  What we did get to eat was fabulous though.",

Some would think 4 hours is too long for a meal, but consider your senses on high alert, never a dull moment, beautiful people, artwork and masterpieces abound. I can honestly say, I've never experienced anything like it.   Every aspect of the meal is carefully and very thoroughly thought through. Bread amazing, butter utterly divine and none you've tasted before.   My only gripe, I ordered a bottle of champagne, that I was told is rare and hard to get in US. Bottle was $225, but I found it later with free shipping on Vivino for $69.99. 300%+ markup I feel is a tad over the top, 200% is more than fare. Next time I'll stick to a couple glasses, I felt a bit taken.  Thank you Chefs and staff for your amazing service.",

I need stimulation from new courses.  6/1/13, fabulous meal, some cutbacks: *mignardises are way more edited, our last visit 02/13, they were mentioning how diners go way overboard and pick every item off the cart *printed menus are not on thick cardstock anymore, still the iridescent lavender *new sommelier?  He was very green.  He never came by to ask for our selection for the evening.  Made up for it by giving us full glasses of Krug.  Courses came and wine was poured 1-2 minutes after, too long, he should be timing it with the service staff  Standouts: *Symphony of morels, ricotta and herb ravioli in a pea veloute, delicate morel royale with green asparagus, turnip and Arbois vin jaune broth with foie gras *Le Caviar, carrot leaves with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, salmon tartar with shiso sprouts *Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander *Black cod on a daikon velvet puree with lime zest *Grilled beef rib eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment *Broccolini and soybean sprouts served as a risotto *Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce *Blueberry and white chocolate on the mignardises cart  If you are there for a special occasion, they will roll you a mini cake of strawberry, sorbet, meringue and ice cream with a candle.  Roll it back out on a cart and then cut the cake for your party.  Cake is OK.  Composed desserts on the menu are much better.

Splurged and ordered their $445/per person tasting menu that included more than 18 sampler dishes. To be fair, the last four were desserts. An abundance of black truffles & caviar was used in almost every dish, I don't usually like either/or but they paired it so nicely everything tasted wonderful - not to mention each presentation was a work of art that I didn't know whether or not to eat my dish or frame it! ** Hint: Don't fill up on the tempting bread selection & save room after your 4 hr dining experience before asking for seconds. If you are catching a live show, select the later venue and reserve early by booking 5:30 pm if available bc it will take you that long to enjoy your meal. Our waiter was fantastic at explaining to us each dish being served & even offered us a complimentary ice cream cake for us without any special occasion. Best of all, they package a fruit cake in a beautiful bag for you to take home as a gift with a copy of the menu. Worth every cent & must be on everyone's bucket list to do at least once in your life before going broke. Just don't order the Evian water which they charge at $10 each bottle!",

We got the 17 course tasting menu.  Every item that came out had amazing flavors that I can't even describe.  They start you off with a selection of bread you choose off a cart. If you are doing the tasting menu, don't try all the breads, I stopped myself halfway when my wife told me I should stop.  The butter was fresh and they out sea salt on it. My favorite dishes were the salmon with black caviar on top with a wasabi cream and the last dish which was a wagyu beef.  The drinks were also really good, I wish I remember the name for my first drink because it was my favorite, but it was in the old era section and it was a martini with gin.   The last 3 courses were dessert.  Even though I barely had any room, I did eat everything.   The presentation was fantastic.  They take their time into making everything look good.  One of the desserts looked like a forest in a cup.  It was a work of art and I felt bad eating it, but i did.  They send you home with a little gift as well.   Great place to come for a special occasion, it is pricey, but instead of gambling it away, come and enjoy this place.",

It is over $450 per person but once in your lifetime you've gotta try it.",

We were in Vegas for Valentine's Day weekend, also celebrating the hubby's acceptance into residency, and it was just before my birthday, so it was the perfect excuse to splurge! Service was impeccable and the food was unique and absolutely delicious. It also didn't hurt that we got a complimentary ride back to our hotel in a Rolls Royce! Definitely a night to remember. (:",

    "text": "I wavered between 3-4 stars and finally settled on 3 based on the overall experience. When you are spending at least $700/ couple on a meal, I expect absolute perfection and there were some flaws.   I called a few days prior because I was told that if you are eating there, a house car would come get you from your hotel. When I called before hand they had agreed. Then when I called that day, she said no the house car was full. Why I was not told to reserve beforehand when I called just a few days ahead? First flaw.   To start, the server had the bartender come over and answer some questions to help my husband decide on a drink. Unfortunately the bartender was not very helpful and seemed a little snobby to us and as if he was annoyed to be answering questions. When my husband switched to the wine, he decided just to order without a recommendation.    Regarding the food- Some dishes were absolutely amazing and the presentation was out of this world. The bread cart was great but I thought it odd they only want up the first round then may serve it cold. For this price, shouldn't every piece be warm?  While most dishes were great, 2 dishes came outline warm which was not amazing. Specifically the potato puree which Joel is known for. It was barely warm, dare I almost say room temperature. The dessert (specifically the one that came in an orb) was beautiful and delicious and the tray of smaller desserts was an amazing finisher.   Our server was generally good until the end when we needed to leave and he hadn't been by in awhile. Understand I am being more critical because for the price and the fact it is a 3 star restaurant. We have been to a few 1/2 star restaurants that cost less and were better so that is why I chose 3 stars.",

    "text": "I can finally cross this place off my bucket list. It's been on there since I saw it profiled on a Travel Channel show more than a decade ago. It's a formal space that's fit for any special occasion -- like my birthday. Seating is comfortable, especially if you can get one of the corner booths. The decor is ornate in an old world sort of way. I felt like I was dining at my grandmother's place in the sense of its formality (minus the plastic covering that was on her furniture).   Dishes are all a work of art. Everything is meticulously placed and plated. Plates and bowls are unique to most dishes and compliment the aesthetic of the food. The bread cart is as amazing as everyone says. I wasn't shy about selecting a few. The bacon bread, brioche with gruyere, and mini croissant were standouts. The separate cart for the butter is nearly as impressive with its tower of rich, creamy butter. Even that is beautifully presented as it's carved and plated table side in an \"O\" shape and finished with a touch of salt.  Between the two of us, my wife and I shared three appetizers. The $26 supplement for the mushroom  and veal ravioli was steep, but we reveled in every amazing bite. The Alaskan king crab salad was beautifully plated and a forkful of crab, avocado, tomato with olive oil with each bite proved to be light, slightly acidic, delicate, and refreshing. The asparagus veloute that followed was velvety smooth.  The first entree to arrive was a bowl with roasted lobster, chestnuts, asparagus in a shellfish jus. It was an interesting dish with bold, earthy flavors. A rich and hearty dish perfect for the chilly weather. The grilled rib eye plate that followed was almost like a parody of high-end, fine dining restaurant dishes with it's minuscule portions. The two slices of beef were small, but at least they were excellent cuts of tender, well seasoned beef. The addition of Robuchon's famous butter-laden potato puree lived up to the hype. The final entree -- roasted veal chops with thin mushroom ravioli -- was one of my favorites. The sweetbreads that accompanied it were like tiny, crispy croutons that enhanced the savoriness of the dish while adding a contrast in textures.  For dessert we opted for the chocolate souffle -- a perfect example of restrained sweetness and the perfect balance of bitterness. Raised high above the ramekin, it was an impressive sight that eventually collapsed after the addition of ice cream. There was no need to reinvent this classic dish as their execution was as good as any I've experienced.  When dining here you always have to save room for the mignardises cart. My wife declined their offer of a birthday cake when making our reservation (that's a $30 supplement, I believe) so they brought out a pre-selected plate of mignardises. Which I was perfectly happy with. The choices on the cart are plentiful and I would have be too indecisive to select. I made short work of that plate and they brought the cart around to offer more. The lady bug -- a chocolate mousse tart -- was the best of the bunch. Our server also recommended the tiramisu and creme brulee. Both were quickly brought out from the kitchen. Served in shot glass-sized glasses, the tiramisu was a beautifully layered, creamy rendition and the creme brulee was equally amazing.  While it is an expensive restaurant, if you have the funds it's worth experiencing at least once.",

Great selection on the bread cart and the dessert cart was a feast for the eyes. The establishment was very Parisian chic.  We were running late and they were able to accommodate us. The only complaint is that we had mentioned that it was a birthday/anniversary celebration and unlike other places that gave us a dessert or something special, this place didn't. Another table celebrating a birthday received something.",

Once you get over the 30 or 40 dollar glasses of wine and champagne, you can truly appreciate what you pay for here.  The tiniest of details are immaculately taken care of and the food is prepared with an incredible combination of culinary skill and artistry.  The pictures don't do any justice.  When you taste the food, it is truly as special as the presentation.  There are no muddled flavors in the sauces.  Everything is on the plate for a reason and is prepared to be noticed and compliment or enhance the flavor of something else on the plate.    First off - know the price tag before going and plan accordingly.  Second, it is French cuisine, not an American restaurant.  This was a special experience, one that I planned well in advance to make sure the price didn't factor into the experience and it exceeded all expectations.    You will feel special booking a reservation here.    You will be impressed by the staff and the level of service.  You will be amazed by the cuisine.  You will be proud to share the memory of the experience for years and years.",

Yeah, you pay for it, but this was one of the finest meals of my life.  And it just might be the most luxurious in terms of the types of dishes served.  We opted for the free limo ride, which was a great, great start to the meal.  Limo service to and from dinner, in a gold limo, through the back entrance of the casino, started the night off right.  Ordered the menu degustation.  Ordered our wine a la carte so we could get exactly what we wanted (but in hindsight, should have opted for the beverage pairing.)  Service was impeccable.  From the bread and butter service through dessert, if they could incorporate some element of showmanship, they did.  And far from pretentious, it really just showcased the excellent in how they handled and presented to food.  It's worth listing every dish, but just going to highlight the truly excellent ones: Osetra caviar on king crab and crustacean gelee - luxurious and excellent Carpaccio of foie gras and potato covered in black truffles - luxurious and excellent Scottich salmon confit wit osetra caviar and wasabi - very good Maine lobster with turnip and dressing Lettuce veloute with ricotta ravioli Egg with pearl rice and truffle - very good Frog leg fritters - excellent Truffled langoustine ravioli - very good Seared diver scallop with kumquat and caviar - one of the best scallops I've ever had Herbs in broth Uni atop potato and fennel puree - one of the weakest dishes, despite the uni Black cod with bok choy - very good Spiny lobster with green curry Chateaubriand and foie gras - one of the best dishes of the night Passionfruit and banana mousse Grapefruit sorbet with Campari Mango with salted caramel mousse Chocolate and cherry \"Black Forest\" - one of the most impressive looking desserts ever Mignardises  it is worth the splurge.  Really.  3 Michelin stars when Michelin was still in Vegas, it deserved every single one.",

Although I would say to Tokyo restaurant won in taste in all 3 courses, the aesthetics of the dishes in LV made it worthwhile.  Like the Tokyo restaurant, the meal starts off with your selection from the bread cart. We were too full last time in Tokyo to try this, and now I fully regret it. The bread was super soft and absolutely delectable when paired with extra virgin olive oil and their hand churned butter.  The appetizers were extremely good and we were glad to have ordered the menu where we can select 2 appetizers each. We ordered the grilled foie gras, sea urchin, lobster ravioli, and lettuce soup. The only dish that did not impress us was the lettuce soup; it was good, but nothing special. The entree we had were the duck with foie gras and ribeye with bone marrow. The ribeye was seasoned too salty for my taste but the duck was perfect.  The dessert was unbelievable. In addition to the chocolate souffle and orange caramel cream, we can select from a variety of bite-size desserts!!!",

And the caviar with crab and fennel. And the tartar. I don't think I've ever tasted such creamy deliciousness in my life!!  Given the bajillion of reviews before mine, I don't really have anything to add...except that they do not limit you in the number of breads or cheeses you can choose from their giant carts.   I'll be seeing you again Joel Robuchon...just like one is supposed to set aside part of their income to buy a house, I'm setting mine aside for a once a year trip to Vegas to eat at you again.",

The Restaurant is very tastefully opulent and they feed u so much food! They had these choices - so we picked almost the cheapest for $200 each and then u add the wine and service etc.. So we went for the fixed price Appetizer and main course menu But they served us so much extra stuff - started with a fancy Amuse Bouche then a Bread cart with like 50 different varieties of bread and then they surprised us with a candle lit Anniversary Cake. But wait there's more - they bought this huge cart of the most delicious truffles and mini desserts!  Really memorable experience!",

    "text": "Great food and great service. Yes, very expensive but you pay for the entire food, service, and experience.  Watching the wait service with their bread, cheese, and dessert carts are fun. Some reviewers complain about the service being subpar. Fortunately for me, I did not experience that at all.  They were all superb. Ok. Maybe I do have 2 little complains: they do need more training on pouring wine and they suddenly just walked away as I was picking my desserts out from the cart and wasn't patient enough to explain to me each of the items on the cart for the second time (he just rattled off all the items so fast my head was spinning and I forgot what was the first item he mentioned). You can definitely tell who are the experienced wait staff.   So the food.... my party got the 3 and 2 course meals.  Didn't try the 16 course because we knew we couldn't eat that much food.  The 3 or 2 course meal was a great choice. You get the bread, cheese, and dessert selections too. Raw scallops were the best (and I don't even like raw food). Souffle is the best dessert I've had, not too sweet or overwhelmingly too much chocolate and very light.  It popped up so much and the portion was sooooo big that we couldn't even finish it. There was a little bit of sadness there. Bread... Love them, yes only the first set of bread is warmed and if you get more later, you have to specifically ask them to warm it (rather annoying). Cheese... Not a big fan of the cheese but they had a range of different one, besides that i couldn't comment more because I know nothing else. Dessert.... Everything on the cart that i got to try were great, the herb sorbet was great. At the end of my 3 course dinner, i was stuffed.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while so when I went for the Restaurant Show I made a reservation.  This place is a foodie's dream.  If you are not into fine dining and French food please DO NOT spend your money here because you will be GREATLY disappointed.   I spent North of $1000 for the 16 course tasting menu for 2 people with 1 alcoholic drink.  I don't know what I was thinking but that is a lot of food.  I was getting full half way through the tasting menu.  The bread cart was awesome but it is a filler so don't load up on it too much because you won't have room for the other dishes.  The menu changes slightly during the year but overall the food is good.  This is one of those places you have to experience if you can afford it.  It is not just about the food it is a complete dining experience for your senses.  The way it is presented, tastes, smells, the textures of each element on the plate in your mouth.    The plating was borderline over the top.  The funny thing is some of the non-edible elements on the plates are glued on which is kind of ghetto in my book for a place like this.    This is definetely a place for you and your honey to get dolled up and spend several hours in a very nonrushed atmosphere and just soak in the experience.  Afterwards you can walk out and try to win the money you spent at this place at the tables.  Good Luck!  Oh, before you leave ask them for a copy of the menu which they will gladly provide with the date and your name on it.  It makes for a nice keepsake.  I'm planning on framing it with my receipt.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to write this review for quite sometime, we actually ate here back in the end of January. Slacker I know...   So I'm keeping it simple because I took a lot of photos so you could see for yourselves the opulence that awaits you. (good ole iphone, ilove)   We've been lucky enough to dine at both 3 Michelin Star rated restaurants on the West Coast now, the other being Thomas Keller's French Laundry (Yountville/Napa) of course.   Joel Robuchon is a world-renowned French Chef whose is also known as \"Chef of the Century\", so I will humbly write my thoughts. Can humble and opinionated work together?? hmnnn...   The experience was really quite wonderful, the bread cart and desert carts alone create in you a sense of awe. This surprised me, because lots of reputable Chefs have come to Vegas and opened restaurants, but somehow most fail to bring the quality and class of a real exquisite fine dining experience. It's funny to walk through slots to get here, when you walk in, you feel as though you just fell through the back of someones closet into Narnia.   The whole vibe and essence of this restaurant is over the top FRENCH.  It is decorated beautifully, the color hues are so elegant and yet a tad modern. There must have been a Dupioni Silk shortage after they dressed this place! The waitstaff are extremely professional and poised. After a while, we were able to get them to smile and joke with us, they were very friendly and made sure that we had everything we could possibly need.   We opted for the 16 course tasting menu. The dishes are beautifully and ornately plated. They are actually almost too ornate. One of the courses even had a special double bowl to hold dry ice underneath, so that when they brought out the dish you had fog seeping out from beneath your glass bowl.   I say too ornate because, although we were wowed by the smoke and mirrors.... a little of the taste was lost in translation. I mean the actual ingredients were some of the best available, and yet they did too much with it or to it, to be fully enjoyed for what it was. Had we not gone to The French Laundry the month before, we might of experienced it a little differently. A lot of the dishes main ingredients were the same as the ones at French Laundry, but the difference is that Thomas Keller served the item at it's best without adding too much frou frou. Some food just needs to be served so that you can taste it's perfection. Like butter poached lobster (F.L.), what would you add to it, that wouldn't lessen the flavour and texture of the sweet lobster that has been carefully poached in butter so that the meat stays deliciously delicate instead of rubbery like most?? I didn't really care for the soup with the chorizo in it. (if I'm eating chorizo, i want some huevos too) Also, the bean sprout styled like risotto was Ehh... being asian I've had my fair share of bean sprouts, but not when we're paying $1200 for the 2 of us. Don't get me wrong, the food served at Robuchon's is still probably some of the best you'll ever be priviledged to eat, but if I had to choose between the two I'd have to say, I'm heading back to Yountville. Unless, of course I actually win while in Vegas, nah.... that'll never happen.   Five stars because it was a delicious and memorable experience.  How could I rate it less when restaurants serving burgers & burritos are being rated 5 stars???   Yelp really needs more stars, or like a special platinum star.  Sorry, thought it was going to be short.  = p",

    "text": "Amazing! We were staying at the Wynn and Joel Robuchon had a limo waiting for us to take us to our 6pm reservation. We were led through a private courtyard that served as a perfect background for pictures.  As we entered the restaurant, we noticed that the decor was extravagant and beautiful. Purple plush love seats with the decor matching the season.  My girls and I each decided to do the 6 course tasting menu for $195 since we knew that the 16 course would overwhelm us. The sommelier was extremely knowledgable and introduced us to some wines that suited our palette perfectly.  The bread cart was absolutely divine! Every restaurant should have a selection like that. Although they had a total of about 20 different types of breads, our favorite was the gyuere cheese brioche, the milk bread, the wheat miniture baguette, and the bacon bread. The bread was warmed up for us and we were served butter \"the classic french way,\" cut from a huge block of butter on a cold marble slab and dusted with sea salt.  Our amuse-bouche was caviar over a white grape gelatin over crab mixed with cream of fennel. It was divine! The flavors melded well and the hints of fennel gave the dish a different layer of sophistication.  My appetizer was clams with seaweed butter garnished with caviar and a buckwheat crisp. It was delicious, I will never see clams the same way again.  Our soup was a creamy chestnut soup served with bacon infused foam, with bits of bacon and foie gras in the bottom of the dish. It was heaven. Never in my life have I had such a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras.  My two main courses consisted of duck with foie gras and braised veal cheeks in a Thai broth. Both were also delish. Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Beyond that though, the flavors went extremely well together - perfectly thought out dishes. I now know the title of \"chef of the century\" is well-deserved.  Our cheese course was also divine - too many to remember, but all wonderful to tease your palette with.  My dessert was a melting chocolate cake with infused foam and coffee ice cream. It was the best chocolate dessert I have ever had.   Finally, the chocolate cart - all made on the premises by the pastry chef - just exquiste. How do I even describe that 15 mins of heaven.   The was a parting gift from the pastry chef and our food adventure seemed like it ended as soon as it began with a ride back to Wynn in the limo, rubbing our tummies as we discussed what we will have the next time we are back here.  Merci and J t'aime Joel Robuchon!",

Don't get me wrong their olive oil was really good. I'm not there to taste whats behind the olive oil flavor.   The scallop dish I had way better else where. It wasn't seared right, a very light sear.   I didn't get this dish Le Caviar. Just so simple. Besides the green asparagus was the best steam asparagus I had. But it's just asparagus with caviar on top.   Well this was the best dish of the night Les Crustaces. Reallly gooood.   The bread and butter was really good.  Everything else was just so so.  Presentation was really nice and pretty but in the end food must taste just as good. Which was not.  I thought this would be the best meal of my life. I was wrong.

    "text": "I am going to keep this as short as I can because if I don't, the sheer breadth of the multi-page analysis that dinner at Joel Robuchon merits would surely crash the servers and send Yelpers from LA to Portland, Maine spiraling into an existential K-Hole from which they would likely never emerge.  Considerate as I am of the spiritual well-being of my fellow Yelpers I will say, simply, that not once in my many trips to this culinary temple have I ever felt disappointed in the slightest.  Not by the fabled bread cart that offers, among others, the micro baguettes studded with mustard seeds and lardons of ham.  Not by the varying levels of truffles and foie gras that find their way into many of the dishes.  Not in the cheese cart redolent of bloom and funk and moldy goodness.  I have yet to dispatch anything at this restaurant that did not make me furrow my brow in the way that one does when listening to Heifetz or reading Proust.  A furrowing of the brow is, I reckon, a reflexive visual marker indicating a measure of serious consideration.  Serious consideration... that is to say... a deep and complex process of synaptic negotiation of what we, in our abject inadequacy, refer to as \"Genius.\"  That's what we have here, kids.  Genius with a capital G.   There are those who would, quite predictably, seek to distract you from this truth by pointing out the fact that Chef Robuchon is rarely in the kitchen,  spending a weekend in LV every two months or so to tinker with the menu.  To them I say just eat there.  Go spend an evening with Executive Chef Claude le Tohic and his staff and then tell me, if your conscience will allow it, that it matters whether the namesake is in-house or not.  Because I've been there under both circumstances and the difference was plainly non-existent.  Everyone who works there knows exactly how Robuchon wants things and are equally as assiduous in their manifest efforts whether he is on the premises or not.  I would be remiss were I not to warn potential patrons that the check that will inevitably appear after your meal is not for the faint-of-heart or short-of-funds.  But the naked fact of the matter is that you could easily blow as much money or more at the blackjack table in 90 minutes (or less... depending on the stakes).  If you are serious about food, or at all curious about what French Haute Cuisine is all about, you will start saving your pennies now to amass the 5 bills that a dinner here will cost you.  Do it once, at least.  Seriously, I've read your reviews and I can safely say that you are a precious creature, and you deserve it.    Impeccably arrayed and appointed.  Cordial service that is never less than utterly charming.  Every bite is both a feast and a revelation.  You will not have a better meal in the contiguous 48 states.  As good?  Sure.  Better?  No way, no how.   Mark it.",

So when I decided to give it a try I chose what I thought would be the best.   I would say no dish was memorable. I was excited to finally eat foie gras and truffle. The foie couldn't stand up to monkfish liver. And truffle only reminded me of Chinese preserved egg.   Should've saved the $1000 for more gambling.

Secondly, Always know that there are many price points.. I am not certain, but I think I saw a 3 course tasting for about 125.00 with multiple options up to 250.00. I picked the full 17 course, which was something like 450.00 - throw in a glass of champagne to start.. And a fairly inexpensive descent bottle. Add a descent tip.. 795.00 for one person. Also keep in mind with the menu that I received - the entire Table must order it. It makes sense when you go, because it's all about perfection and timing.  So keep in mind that there are many price points, for me - worth every penny. Amazing.  If I am allowed I will upload my courses.. It's stunning. One last thing. It's mostly fish etc.. Which most French places are.. I don't eat fish, I don't like it.. And I mean none.. But I wanted the experience.. I just about ate every single serving. Amazing what quality can do. Enjoy.",

    "text": "The most amazing desert ever. Joel Rebouchon Las Vegas. My god they put these restaurants in hotels these days! Near the end of a perfect meal (in a 3 star Michelin joint) Joel Rebouchon Las Vegas  So it's pretty simple on the recipe for this one, take a delicious cold lemon curd fluff type thing and add amazing blueberry sorbet. Mix in some wonderful floral syrup and candied violet petals and then seal it in a perfect sphere of sugar. Not in my entire life, and i eat and travel alot, have i ever been this amazed by desert. The food before made space and time its bitch, effing amazing. The service, the bread cart, the butter cart, the candy/cookie cart, next to nothing. Those who say food is merely to \"sustain life\" have never lived. The suckling pig with white beans was the best food i've ever put into my face. Wait, have to mention the potatoes, served with main course. I guarantee, if there was a christian god, she would bathe in these. 2lbs Potatoes to 1lbs of butter, my god. the prior courses were good, but not spectacular so the finale was like the biggest fireworks display you've been apart of, slow to start, good, great, holy cow, to dear effing hey-zeus. There is a reason that the tire company rates restaurants and there's a reason this one of the best of them.  Moral of the story is... If you ever have a chance to eat this well, you should try, just once, i on the other hand will do it as much as possible and maybe bring the wife next time.",

This time we had the 5 course (could of done 6), and omg, what can I say? It was good. The first small bite was interesting, it was umm 3/5 stars. The salad with lobster was delicious along with the soup. I think the fish was tender and the bread selection? DANG!  I love the bread cart and the dessert cart. They were listing out all the bread and dessert, I couldn't even remember what he said.   It's so nice and elegant inside and they even have a small stool thing for your purse. The decor was purple and was just plain nice. The price is yes, expensive, but it's a nice experience.  I would come back to do the 16 course, the neighbor did it and they were taking their time.   I do think I like eating at Cirque a bit more, but this was a life time experience everyone gota try!",

    "text": "IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.  We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm. -The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate. Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread. -Soup: Delicate tofu veloute with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelee, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor. -Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage -1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree **after the 1st main course, I was pretty full. -2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out. **we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by. -Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference. -Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it. -Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different. -Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.  Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.  Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list.",

    "text": "I never understood the classic French fine dining and how people would pay ridiculous amount of money for minuscule portions of food. But after hearing that Joel Robuchon was awarded Chef of The Century and reviewing almost 5 star overall reviews, I thought I'd give this restaurant a try and see what the hype was all about.  My husband and I went there for our anniversary. Arrived there as the first patron. Perfect for picture taking opportunity (especially for the untouched bread, dessert, and a mound of butter.....yet). We were seated in the garden area, a bit more secluded and private. Loved the ambiance and the decor (call me cheesy, but I love anything purple). The service was impeccable. I knew right away what I wanted, Sixteen Course Degustation Menu, without even opening the menu. My husband ordered Four Course Menu. Still skeptical about how magnificent the food was, I was both nervous and excited.  I knew then why people pay such a top dollar to go this place when I ate the first thing they served, Le Caviar (Caviar on a fennel cream). Just the fist bite of it and I am a changed foodie. Everything that we ate that night was delectable and too pretty to eat.  Was it worth the money? I'd say.....ABSOLUTELY! It was unquestionably one of the best moments in my life.",

    "text": "4.5 stars  Came back for the 16 course menu after a couple of years. There's so many dishes so I won't touch on each one.  Le Citron lemon and basil gelee, anise fennel cream  Le Cerise cherry gazpacho with sheep ricotta and pistachios  Le Caviar green asparagus with lemon balm, delicate seafood gelee topped with smooth cauliflower cream, maki of thin couscous - First was quite simply asparagus with caviar. Perhaps not the most dynamic pairing, but the vegetal quality of the asparagus was an interesting pairing with the salty caviar. Next was one of Robuchon's signature dishes of a seafood gelee, cauliflower cream and caviar. Really good. The custard was warm and so soft, with a subtle but present seafood flavor. The cauliflower cream was a nice touch too, especially with the salty caviar. Lastly, a play on a sushi roll - looks like something Urasawa would serve. I really enjoyed the crunchy daikon and couscous in the roll, while the caviar really heightened the flavors.  La Noix de Saint Jacques seared scallop, heart of palm in coriander scented coconut milk  Les Petits Pois light green pea veloute with peppermint on sweet onion cloud  Les Crustaces lobster in sake broth with broccoli and nori, baby octopus in saffron rice, truffled langoustine ravioli  This was probably my favorite dish of the night. There were actually three parts - the lobster, baby octopus and the langoustine. First, the lobster was cooked well, with a tasty sake broth with a strong sea essence. Secondly, this baby octopus on top of saffron rice was very much like paella, though a very well-executed one. The rice was a nice al dente with a vibrant saffron flavor; the octopus was cooked perfectly too, leaving it quite tender. Lastly, one of Robuchon's signatures - langoustine ravioli, here topped with black truffle. Perhaps the best bites of the night, the ravioli was stuffed with chunks of langoustine, which was really tender, sweet and full of flavor. The black truffle added another dimension, with a more subtle earthiness; a haute surf-and-turf if you will. Excellent.  Le Black Cod black cod in daikon bouillon with yuzu  Le Chou crispy fried cabbage with vegetable medley  Le Volaille farm chicken supreme with foie gras, fricassee of young leeks  Les Pousses de Soja risotto of soybeans sprouts, lime zest and chives  L'Amande light almond panna cotta, tahitian vanilla pineapple  La Framboise fresh raspberries and ginger infused sorbet, crunchy honey tuile  Le Moka - Le The escortes de mignardises  Lastly, the mignardises cart came by. The selection was (predictably) rather extensive. I only tried a few here as stomach room was limited.  This was an excellent meal. Thinking back though, there weren't any dishes that were truly amazing, except for maybe the langoustine ravioli and the trio of caviar. For the cost (the tasting menu was $385), I might have expected just a little more. I had very high expectations and it didn't disappoint, but it didn't 'wow' either. Still, it was definitely a memorable meal - the sheer opulence almost guarantees that. However, I don't find myself in such a hurry to go back as I do with Urasawa or The French Laundry.",

    "text": "Opulent is defined as luxurious or ostentatiously magnificent and I can think of no better single word to describe Joel Robuchon.  From you moment you first step into foyer, you know this meal is going to be ridiculous.  Even all seating, walls, and decorations are in diffuse shades of purple, the majestic royal color.  Most of the starred michelin restaurants are french restaurants with not-too-dissimilar sounding menus, so you may as well go all the way to the sole 3-star restaurant because it's worth the trip.  We did not do the 16-course degustation menu (I have a reason to come back...).  Instead we opted for the \"pick 2 main courses option\" and all the extra courses surrounding that.  Here's what I got:  1.  First off, the bread cart comes around and there are literally probably 25-30 different kinds of bread on it.  You can pick as many as you want, all fresh and wonderful.  They take your selections away to heat them, and bring them back promptly.  I went with the milk bread, bacon bread, and rosemary ciabatta.  2. The amuse bouche was osetra caviar layered on top of a crab gelee with fennel cream.  Probably the most ridiculous amuse bouche I've ever heard of.  3.  Appetizer: King Crab in Avocado on Romaine Heart, with olive oil.  4.  Soup: Chestnut cream soup over chestnuts, foie gras, with bacon foam.  (Read that again... BACON FOAM!)  5.  Main Course #1: Duck Breast with seared foie gras.  This is easily the finest cut of duck breast I've ever had, and perfectly prepared.  Duck is so hard to get right, and even in NYC there are only 2 places where I really like it (Porterhouse and La Sirene), and this blew both of those out of the water.  Succulent, tender, flavorful.  6.  Main Course #2: Kobe Ribeye with wasabi spinach and malibu bell peppers.  Also, they served it up with a side of Robuchon's specialty whipped creamy potatoes.  They're like mashed potatoes, but your grandma never made mashed potatoes this creamy before.  I wonder if he patented some special machine to do this.  7.  Then the cheese cart comes out, and it is as full of choices as the bread cart was.  Remember, everything here is about luxury and extravagance, so you can take as many different cheeses as you want to try!  I posted a photo of it if you want to see what it looks like.  8.  Dessert: Pineapple Compote with Peanut ice cream.  What a unique flavor combination, but it worked really well.  The ice cream was as thick and creamy as you'd expect it to be.  9.  The crowning end to the night is the cart of Mignardises.  There are numerous pictures posted of this, and you pretty much have to see it to believe it.  If I thought the bread and cheese carts were awesome, then this set of sweets is absolutely incredible.  Save room because you don't want to miss this part of the evening!",

    "text": "Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22  Let me start by answering your questions;  \"No\" and \"No.\"  For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness.   Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, aperitifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!  I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night.   Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing.   For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal.   So now for your questions; Was it worth it? NO Would we go back? NO  PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[",

    "text": "Basically the best restaurant you will ever eat at (I preferred it over French Laundry).  We usually do one over the top restaurant in Vegas each time.  Last time was Picasso, this time Joel Robuchon.  Let me break down how amazing the restaurant is for you:  Service This is high-end French dinner theatre.  When you order bread, it's not a hand-carried tray of bread.  No sir.  It is a cart of ~20 breads.  And the butter to go with it?  Also on a cart, under a dome of glass.  They gently carve off a spiral of butter from a monument of butter, carefully sprinkle salt over it, and accompany it with some EVOO.  If you have been a waiter before, you will find no errors in hand placement, serving, bussing, etc.  It's all perfection.  They seem to operate as a team of lead waiter, back waiter and busser - which is typical in fine dining.  Food I did the 3 course (Amuse-bouche, entree, dessert) and left more than full.  I am not sure how I could handle any more courses.  While each course was appropriately sized (think French restaurant), the food was filling and flavorful.  And of course, once you add in bread and the second 'wave of desserts' - you are looking at a good amount of food.  Decor The restaurant is beautiful.  We sat along a wall which featured different live plants, cascading down the wall.  The contrast from the casino floor could not be more dramatic.  Every interior decor detail was amazing (seat, pillow, table cloth, charger, plate, glass, etc.).  It's an experience that is refreshing and has a strong point-of-view.  Value Well it depends on how you order and how you define value.  Certainly the secret pizza place at the Cosmo is your best price:quality on the strip.  So I struggle here.  It's obviously a $$$$ restaurant, but it's also impeccable service, food and decor.  I would say this is a strong mark for them, but don't come here looking for value.  Overall Best dining experience I can remember.  I eat out a lot, often at high-end restaurants.  This takes the cake for me as far as the combination of food, service and decor/ambiance.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon could not possibly have done more in the way of service and presentation.  To give you an idea of what I mean:  a couple next to us ordered tea.  The wait staff brought a cart by with a variety of live potted tea plants.  While wearing white gloves, they cut the individual tea leaves off to put in a cup of warm/hot water, which was heated by a small candle.  While walking to the restaurant, I was a little skeptical that the ambiance would live up to its reputation.  Located in the middle of MGM Grand, you pass slot machines in a smoke filled casino when walking to the entrance.  However, once inside, you are transported to the serene, rich, and romantic world of Joel Robuchon.  Plush purple seats, amazing artwork, beautiful floral arrangements, and a stunning chandler in the center of the room.  The bathrooms, while chic, were actually a little difficult to use.  Everything was black.  The floors, the toilet, the sink, the linens--everything black.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but the lighting in the bathroom is pretty low, making it seem like you're taking a pee and washing your hands in outer space.  The food was exquisitely presented and flawlessly executed.  There was never a hint of sloppiness or unsteady hand.  This was a masterful representation of culinary precision.  HOWEVER... ************* Ultimately, for a 3 Michelin star restaurant and a $600+ bill for two, I expect the absolute best dining experience of my life.  Everything here was the best I've ever experienced--except for the food.  There was not a single dish that I will remember.  All of the dishes tasted good, but none were exceptional in my mind.  This is the sole reason I gave four out of five stars.  I may not have eaten at other 3 Michelin star restaurants, but I have eaten at other 5-star AAA restaurants and James Beard Award-winners' restaurants.  It was there that I experienced the sensation of my jaw dropping and my mouth watering long after eating--not at Joel Robuchon. *************  I still implore you to come here if you want to experience the best service, presentation, and ambiance a restaurant can offer.  I thought my review was starting to run long, so here is a quick summary of the individual food dishes I tried:  For our anniversary, we got the 4-course menu selection.  Caviar L'Amuse-bouche: presented in a round metal tin, which was both cool and tacky.  It felt a little like I was being served a can of sardines.  It tasted good enough, but I still don't see what the big deal about caviar is.  Truffled langoustine ravioli: the umami flavor from the truffles floods your palette, but then leaves a sweet lobster finish.   Foie gras with artichoke: pretty and well balanced.    Chestnut soup: Tasted like a bacon latte.  Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass-way too much lemon flavor.  I couldn't taste anything else.  Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach: perfectly cooked and tender.    Fuji apple confit, cinnamon sable and Manzana milkshake: I probably would've preferred a brownie and ice cream over this dish.  Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit: ice cream and chocolate were yummy, but the lemon confit took over the whole dish.  They offer dozens of different breads.  Butter from France, olive oil from Spain.  To finish the meal, they offer 60 or so different varieties of little chocolates.  My favorite was the French Mystery.  Imagine the tiniest possible little bite size eclair.  And then, imagine it has a little baby, and that baby sits on top of its mommy.  Now you're picturing the French Mystery.  To celebrate our anniversary, the restaurant surprised us with a sorbet and coconut cake with orange sauce.",

As the only three star Michelin restaurant in Las Vegas, it has definitely earned the distinction of impeccable food and service.  The 16 course meal was beautifully presented and prepared and we were happy to have come here.  I personally enjoyed the vegetarian 16 courses better than the \"meat\" option and I was underwhelmed by their truffle dish, but everything else was worthy of its rating.  Their bread platter and dessert spread was beautiful and enticing.  I still consider Alinea my favorite but this experience was definitely a solid one.",

    "text": "I was here in April and was hoping I'd be in love but alas, far from.  As our orders were being taken, I asked for the sommelier.  Shortly after the order was taken, a complementary soup from the chef was served - still no sommelier.  I asked again and quietly refused to touch my food until a sommelier arrived.  I would say from the moment we sat down to a sommelier coming to our table was around 30+ mins.  Not acceptable to me, especially at a high end restaurant like this.  The other thing that was erie was how dead quiet everyone was.  I mean, NO ONE was talking in the restaurant.  I was afraid to talk because everyone would hear my conversation, even at a soft voice and if I whispered, it would be really obvious.  The food was great, but having lived and dined at some amazing restaurants in NYC, this really didn't blow me away.  It just wasn't AMAZING as I expected it to be.  It felt on par and some of it not as good as to what I've experienced at other before.  We had the Le Homard Roasted lobster in green asparagus jus with vegetable essence, Le Navet Rouge Carpaccio of lemon flavored scallops with red turnip and radish, La Langoustine truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage, and a few other dishes I don't remember.  The dessert though - that chocolate souffle was to die for!  This rating is for overall experience and value.  For as much as I paid, I could've spent 1/3rd of the bill and gotten an equally great meal in NYC (and the ticket to NY, at that!).  Service was nice and they were polite but it wasn't outstanding.  And I also asked about the complimentary limo service which wasn't available.  Sigh.  Maybe it was a one off but I'm not going back again....unless I only get that chocolate souffle.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas just for a foodie weekend with JR as the main item on our agenda, having made reservations about a month and a half before.    We had made arrangements for the limo pick up but when we went downstairs there was an MGM escalade there so we thought it might've been for us. It turned out it wasn't but the driver called the MGM and told them she'd take us over. It was kinda funny cuz we asked her if the limo was nicer and she politely said 'um, no'. She turned out to be soo right cuz the escalade was gorgeous, luxurious and brand new. We took the limo home and as many of the other reviews have said, it's a bit of a clunker...although 'free is free' I suppose. ;-)  We were in awe walking through the mansion... never even knew it existed. Our hostess was wonderful and told us the history, etc. and even took some pictures of us in the atrium. The restaurant itself was no slacker either... gorgeous and all decked out in purple and pink hues. Even our table had charger plates w/pink ribbons and these cute little trinkets all over the table w/pink and diamond accents. We loved it!  Then came the food.. oh, the food! I won't go into detail on each dish because I'm sure all the other reviews have covered it BUT I will just highlight my favorite dishes: The bread (yes, it's a dish!) was amazing... we each had like 5 or 6 pieces which is WAY too much but it was so hard to resist. They had this amazing bacon bread and this wonderful cheese bread... do not skip the bread cart.   My fav entree was the duck with seared fois gras w/cherries and almonds. This was cooked to PERFECTION and they must've cooked the duck in the fois gras jus because it had the same wonderful flavor. It was a pretty amazing dish!  The truffled langoustine ravioli was also pretty delicious.. and the most amazing part was the cabbage in the middle (shocker I know?!) but it was cooked perfectly and had this amazing savory flavor to it. I'm not a huge cabbage person but if it was always cooked like this I would be! ;-)   If there was one thing that I felt was a little lackluster it was the desserts. Don't get me wrong.. they were stunning and tasty but compared to the rest of the meal they just didn't feel special enough or taste out-of-this world enough. I had the same problem at French Laundry...no wow at the end. Although the mignardise wow'd us.. faboulous selection and all soooo delicious!   They also gave us this wonderful lemon cake to take home along w/a small picture book of JR, which was a really nice touch.   All in all JR did not disappoint and I can see why it would be worthy of it's 3 Michelin stars. I still think the FL was a bit better but would I come back here again? In a heartbeat. ;-)",

    "text": "I mean, it's amazing. flawless, epic, great food, great service, even great parting gifts that we enjoyed for days to come.  we even drove out to the venetian and parked our car there to get a more fantastic limo ride (we were staying at the mgm so we didn't want to not take part in the free limo ride) and we got the tour of the mansion before being seated in a secluded and mostly private spot. this is why i still give it 4 stars.  We each had the tasting menu to celebrate one of my milestone birthdays with some wine. Everything that came out was a party in my mouth from the bread cart all the way to the dessert. I won't bore you with all the details here that will be regurgitating everything else people have already said.  the overall feeling was that so much focus was placed on everything from the limo ride to the presentation of the food, that it was at times distracting from the real reason we were there - the taste of the food. these distractions were the good distractions though. i enjoyed feeling regal for one night. the bad distractions though, were a little annoying and less the fault of the restaurant than the patrons.   there were so many patrons there that night that didn't follow the dress code, or lamely so if that was their weak attempt at trying to dress up. i get that some people are ballers who want to be on the dl but the last thing i want is to feel like i'm dining at a las vegas restaurant vs. joel robuchon. if joel robuchon was in any other city, people would dress up way more to come here. maybe it was just an off day but it was still annoying to see slobby people. it really brings down the ambiance. secondly, the tables were too damn close to each other. thankfully, the couple we were sitting within earshot to, basically rubbing elbows with, were in their 3rd to last dish when we sat there so they were gone by the time we reached halfway through the meal. still, it's really annoying to sit that close to other patrons when they're in their  casual attire, talking about super annoying things when i'm trying to have a moment. the meal is too expensive here to be ruined by stupid reasons.   disclaimer: this was my second choice restaurant after not getting a reservation at the french laundry so i may have been in an off mood. the food was really delicious, just nothing really stood out in a way that i would gush about it, the way i do about akelarre (san sebastian, spain), arzak (san sebastian, spain), le garde robe (paris), les papilles (paris), vandermeersch (paris), seongbukdong (koreatown).   the saving grace was our server, the alcohol, and my companion.",

    "text": "Eh.  That pretty much sums up my experience at Joel Robuchon's restaurant at the MGM Grand.   When your bill was well over $5,000, as ours was, \"eh\" is not supposed to be in your vocabulary.   Now, here's the rub, there is nothing WRONG with this restaurant. The kitchen is impeccable (do ask for a tour when  you're there, that was one of the few highlights), the bathroom has gold finishes, and the food is generally enjoyable.  There was just no spark.  It was like going out on a second date with someone you totally dig as a person (and have heard NOTHING but good things about), but you just don't want to waste your time going on a third date when you don't want to jump their bones. Perhaps it really is me and not you?   A little background: we were a group of late twenty-somethings in Vegas for a yearly reunion. We're all well traveled and well fed pseudo-foodies. We love food. We love wine. We love having a good time.   If you're looking to have a good time, let me just tell you that going to JR will not be conducive to that. The main dining room is more like a monastery than a restaurant. I could hear a pin drop. Thank god, for the private room we decided to eat in cause I think I would've been suffocated by the oppressive silence that sat in the main dining room.   The staff was nice enough, though I'm pretty sure the Sommelier wanted us banished. We asked a few questions about the wine menu (sharing wine pairings for example: at $200+ on top of the few hundred dollars each our dinner was going to be already, we wanted to know if we could share with our partner) and were shut down on many fronts. Fine, whatever .\"If you have to ask...\"is the general feeling I got off that guy.   Also, the menu they sent to us before hand was NOT the menu we ended up getting when we got there and they seemed a little snippy with us when we discovered a few items that some of us would not/could not eat. My thought? If you are paying a few hundred dollars to eat a few ounces of food, it better be something you are neither allergic to nor the thought of which makes your stomach turn. They did end up obliging us, but I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, as if asking was clearly so faux pas and un nouveau riche of us that I should have just kept my mouth shut.  The food itself was fine. Lots of molecular gastronomic flourishes. Interesting combinations. Liberal use of truffles and foie gras. You know, the usual for these types of restaurants. The veal cheeks were pretty freaking amazing, but at the end of the meal I was hungrier than when I first started eating.   Saving grace? The bread cart. The sweet sweet bread cart.   All in all, I felt like I were suddenly transported to an episode of Platinum Weddings (there were actually pink and white fake diamonds scattered around our table with purple ribbons and shimmery menu paper...) It was great for like five minutes, but at the end of the evening I was hungry, a little slighted, and ready to exist back in the real world.  At least I got some lemon loaf (included in their swag bag) for the road...",

First, this is a beautiful space with tall ceilings, comfortable seating, unbelievable flowers and a classic elegance befitting their reputation.    The tasting menus are expensive, but you can choose the number of courses and limit the cost while still enjoying the night out.  As mentioned the wine list is world class and so are the prices.  The bread cart is amazing.  I won't go into all the choices, but everything is presented with an artistic flair.  Maybe a bit too much foam for me (repeated on multiple courses), trying to be too creative, but everything was truly world class.    Desserts, coffee (espresso/cappuccino), and after dinner drinks are everything you would expect.  Service is somewhat stuffy, though attentive.  But hey, this is pseudo-French, and you are dropping maybe $800 for two, so that's part of the schtick.  Robuchon is a bucket list restaurant, for sure, but if you go it will be one of those foodie highlights that will be a metric for all others.",

I probably would have given it two stars simply because it was terrible compared to the price - meat overcooked, several courses with uninteresting flavors, etc. There were a few standout courses and the cheese cart was amazing, so we decided to give it another try last night (6/7/13) and I am SO glad we did! I would definitely now rank it in my list of top 10 restaurants in the country.  We had the tasting menu (16 courses that are really 12 courses because some come as a trio), which in my opinion is the only way to go - course after course of amazing and interesting combinations! I won't go into too much detail as the menu changes seasonally, but everything was exquisite. Highlights: the three caviar courses, the foie gras dumplings in broth, lobster with a curry sauce...honestly everything was a highlight. It is all beautifully presented, which makes it even more fun. Our server told us one of the courses (a side of gelee with mozarella ball dots and tiny tomato dots on top) takes a chef 25 minutes per plate just to prepare the dots.  Three different carts come to your table at different points in the meal: A phenomenal bread cart with tons of interesting fresh-baked breads comes at the beginning of the meal (and whenever you want it). I think I tried half of it throughout the meal! Definitely have the rosemary brioche!! They also bring out a cheese cart right before dessert with probably 30 different cheeses from France and the US. We tried most of them, which is definitely the best way to do it as you can't tell which ones will be your favorite from the descriptions. The ones I liked best were the ones I almost did not choose! Then, after the dessert courses in the tasting menu, a dessert cart comes by. Everything on it was good, but I think it was the weakest of the carts as there aren't as many options and I didn't love the ones we tried. (The dessert cart at Guy Savoy, for example, is much better.) However, you're so full by that point it hardly matters!  We got the wine pairing, which we were told adds to a little over a bottle per person! I would definitely recommend it. There are three tiers - I believe one is $300/person, one is $600, and one is $1000. There is no list, as they select the wines as they go, but the higher tiers have pricier wines. We chose the lowest tier since I didn't think we were sophisticated enough about wine to notice the difference, and we loved every wine we were served. The sommelier explained that they always start with a champagne, then go through mostly whites, a few reds toward the end, and then dessert wines.  Ambiance is actually a little less stuffy than you would expect. They have a lot of couch seating, a well-lit chandelier, and dark purple colors which all add to a feeling of warmth. It is definitely quiet, but for that type of meal, it's a little nice. The service is fantastic, as you would expect. They all work as a team (we were served by about 6 different people throughout the evening) and as the meal takes quite some time, we got to know them really well throughout the night! We finally left at around 1:30am, and everyone was really nice about the fact that we were the last ones there.  I wouldn't do the 16 course menu again until it changes, but I can't wait to go back!!!",

The restaurant is cozy and well decoated  We opted for the 16 course. It is not as daunting as it sounds. The portions are at most bite sized but your palate will be well stimulated. Expect dinner to run late. Don't rush through it and savor all the flavors, layers and complexity of the dishes. They offer a bread cart but make sure you don't overload.   Towards the end, during our last course we felt comfortable. Not stuffed. Dinner was long with great conversation and amazing food. The service is impeccable and Staff are very well mannered and informative.   Make sure you save room for dessert! I may start having my lunches here.",

Robuchon is a foodies Shangri La.  The techniques that they use along with the flavor profiles were unbelievable.  My wife said after dining there, it set the bar so high that all of her other favorite high end restaurants that we have been to do not even come close to this place and does not know if any other restaurant will come close in comparison.  Note to others who may try this place.  There is a dress code here.  Do not come dressed in a polo shirt and jeans.  This place is very elegant.  Bon Appetit !",

    "text": "I usually write a thorough review on each dish, but if I did that for this restaurant, my review would be a whole essay (since I've tried both the 16-course tasting & a 4-course tasting at another time).  The  16-course tasting takes 4 hours to complete and the 4-course tasting takes 2-3 hours.  Instead of describing each dish in detail, I will go over the experience and cart selections.  If you are not staying at the MGM, schedule limo service through the restaurant  (comes complimentary with the meal).  They are very prompt when they pick you up, drop you off at a back entrance where you are escorted through the mansion (MGM villas) to the restaurant.  If this is your first time at this restaurant, DEFINITELY order the 16 course.  My friend once said at least once in your life, you should try the 16 course tasting at Joel Robuchon (I agree).  I was lucky enough to be able to try it when I still had the metabolism to eat ALL of it (took my family here for father's day 2 years ago).  You start getting a bit full by course #8-9, and belly-busted full by #14.  It's very difficult to clean all 16 plates since there is a long wait time between each course, but mission completed for me :)  SUGGESTION I was given and will pass along:  Even though the bread cart is AMAZING, DO NOT EAT MORE THAN ONE piece of bread.  (Save it for another trip when you do a smaller tasting).  If you eat too much bread, you will get too full to finish the courses.  Each dish was unique and I don't remember a dish that I didn't like.  Don't be fooled  by the small size; each dish is packed with lots of flavor (and cream/butter/richness) and if anything, you will struggle to finish towards the end than be left hungry.  2nd experience at Joel Robuchon was 2 weeks ago for my 27th bday (best bday dinner ever!).  I always told myself I'd return one day to try EVERY bread on the breadcart (since I only had one piece when I did the 16 course tasting), so this time around, goal accomplished. FAVORITE bread:  Bacon bread....followed by some type of cheese bread.  My friend and I ordered different breads and split them in half to taste...there's no way I could eat each & every bread offered if I ate the whole piece (and it's a bit embarrassing to order that much bread too) haha.  Served with olive oil (goes better with the softer breads) & butter sprinkled with sea salt (goes better with breads that have a crunchy crust).  After you choose the bread(s), they warm it up for you so it's fresh and toasty..yum!  This time around, had the following: Amuse Bouche followed by Le Foie Gras (appetizer), Le Tofu (soup), Le Canard (main course), and La Fraise (dessert). Each dish was amazing in its own way; loved the seared foie gras that came with le canard. They also served the famous mashed potatoes with the main course...it was smooth & VERY RICH/CREAMY...almost too rich; first few bites were good, but then it became too much...felt like i was eating sticks of butter with each bite (probably am).  BONUS:  BIRTHDAY CAKE!  (nice surprise).  This was the BEST bday cake I have ever eaten!  It had a refreshing layer of raspberry sorbet held in a light, fluffy, even crunchy meringue shell.  I wish they would let you keep the remainder of the uneaten cake, but since it has sorbet in it, it would melt :(  I actually liked this bday cake more than the dessert I ordered AND all the petit-fours.    Speaking of petit-fours, there are so many on the cart, I wouldn't know where to start.  I had a bite of at least 20 different ones the first time around (can't remember which one I liked the best...too long ago). This time around, had 5 different ones plus the \"lollipop.\"  The lollipop has a light crunch, but not too much flavor.  I did NOT like the lemon macaroon (have had better).  My fave was the chocolate eclair, followed by the hazelnut ball among the 5 i chose (see photos...the 2 most right ones were the best).  Service is superb (of course) and decor is elegant & classy.  The first time I ate here, they had a person playing classical music on a grand piano live, but this time around, they didn't have a live player (still played classical music though).  VERY QUIET environment.  Felt like I had to lower my normal talking voice.  They give you a parting gift when you leave also: first time, I received this moist, buttery pistachio poundcake with raspberries.  This time around, it was a milk chocolate bar with metallic purple flakes on the bottom.  The poundcake was much better than the chocolate bar, but it's not like you get to pick the parting gift...so be happy with whatever it is.  Either way, it will be yummy.  I will be back for sure b/c I still haven't been able to try the cheese cart!  Will update review once that happens (hopefully not too far in the future)....I already have the plan in mind...1 piece of bacon bread in the beginning to save room for all the cheese I'm going to devour :)  Can't wait for my 3rd experience...who wants to take me?",

I mean seriously, I'm just a lowly food lover, not a chef, not a french cook, but just a very happy diner even though I felt a little guilty, as though I was in Louis the fourteenth's court being completely fed on opulence and bounty without a care for anyone starving outside those walls. The food is immaculately prepared. The bread carts and the arrays of little amuse bouche or intermezzo or just small bites between courses are so carefully and thoughtfully put together. The wine list is of course - I mean of course, out of this world. I mean there's nothing to complain about at all. The service is exquisite, the environment is charming and spacious and quiet. The prices are obscene but once you've eaten here you understand why. So yes, I could give it four stars and nit pick and say this and that about the place but if this is meant to be the finest french restaurant in las vegas, then so be it. It is over the top in every way and proud of it.  I am satisfied and impressed and well fed and I feel like I have traveled to a faraway land and been satisfied!",

Came here for a lovely Valentine's dinner and.. It's awesome. So far, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.   Love the dark decor with purple furnishings, dazzling chandeliers, glod accents, and plush cushions.  Their service was on point.  The plating was beautiful and flowed nicely.  The only thing I didn't enjoy were their fake candles.  I guess they got sick of scraping wax off the tables? My favorite is the bread cart--I'm a carb girl.  I could sit there and eat bread all day and be satisfied.  We had the 4-course dinner and we were beyond full by the time we got to dessert.  I'm not sure how people eat the 6 course or even the 16 course tastings.  I guess you'd have to skip out on the bread. The foie gras was my favorite, as usual.  It literally melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting MORE. The second favorite was the dessert cart with coffee.  I love picking and choosing and then picking more! Just like the bread cart my eyes get big and I get greedy!  Can't wait to come here again so I can try the 16 course tasting.  Gotta save something for next time, right?",

    "text": "Summary:  Best restaurant I've been to.  Some of the best dishes I've ever eaten, I use this as the benchmark for all other reviews.  Overall - 5 stars  (rounded up to 5 for the review) Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars Atmosphere - 4.5 stars  There are so many reviews on here, I'm not going to add much, just hit a few high points.  I went for the Menu Degustation, and if you can afford it, definitely try it just for the experience alone - Coming in through the private entrance, being escorted in past the private high roller tables, and of course sitting through a 4-5 hour meal with ~15 courses, and experiencing ridiculous attention to detail and impeccable service.  My only regret was not getting the wine pairing, as I was trying to control costs since I was already dropping $500 on the dinner - but it would have been worth it.  I would not do the full tasting again, but I would definitely come back and sample my favorite dishes, sit in the vertical garden room, dress less formal, and do a wine pairing.  My friend and I set up reservations for 5:30, took the limo over and were greeted by a drop dead gorgeous Asian hostess (who turned out to be the sommelier) who walked us through the MGM back entrance and to the restaurant.  There we were greeted by drop dead gorgeous Asian hostess #2 wearing a long black oriental influenced dress with a high slit along the side - Me Gusta.  Needless to say, my first impression of the restaurant and atmosphere was already very high.    We sat in the main dining room near the fireplace, and I was seated on the big purple velvet like couch - pretty comfy spot, but a bit too hot for a 5 hour stay wearing a suit.  As everyone else has mentioned the decor and atmosphere is over the top and opulent - my only complaint was that it was too quiet at 5:30, as I felt like I had to wisper, but that improved as the night went on.  Service is fantastic, and when doing the degustation, you basically have a team of 4-6 people waiting on you, changing all the place settings, and explaining the dish.  On a side note, we both dressed in full suits as a jacket was required, however most of the other guests were not dressed nearly as formal, and I did see a group with jeans and button ups, and a couple Hawaiian shirts and Polos, so I guess more casual attire can fly.  High points for the food are as follows:  Cavier over Crab Meat with cream- Incredible, I couldn't get enough of this, it was food crack.  Le Bar - Pan fried sea bass with lemon grass - absolutely perfect fish dish.  All the ingredients in the dish were perfectly balanced and complemented each precisely.  The serving is very small, which just makes you savor each bite.  L'os a moelle - bone marrow with sweetbreads - best dish I have ever had, anywhere, hands down.  I actually felt like I was high when eating this.  I have yet to find sweetbreads at any other restaurant that can even come close to comparing.  Le Veau - veal - again, best veal preperation I've had.  Dish is seemingly simple, yet perfect.",

    "text": "I will begrudgingly give Chef Robuchon's namesake restaurant 4 stars...technically I give it 3.5 but will round up. The service and ambience were outstanding..the food was very good...but by no means life changing. I knew going in how much this would cost and I never bitch about price, no one should because we all should be doing our research before going to a Three Star Michelin establishment. What gets me is how miniscule the portions are. I would understand if it was the 16 course Degustation, but I chose the 6 course. I am fine with small portions and am all about quality over quantity, but I was a little taken aback at what I got for $275 (including $35 supplement for three langoustine ravioli that are $75 a la carte). I can't help but feel I paid mainly for that limo ride they include in the price. But it really was a pleasurable meal and we were treated like royalty by a pampering staff (though towards the end of the meal..they failed to fold up my wife's napkin when she went to the restroom- isnt someone supposed to immediately scurry over and do that?) This was are celebratory dinner as we had just gotten married and it was nice, but I was expecting it to be a Top Three meal and I don't even place it in the Top Ten..and for $900..that is a disappointment in my book. I also think the menu plays it safe..nothing reads exciting. I had studied the menu in the past and drooled and some of the dishes listed, but I have come to the conclusion that summer is the worst time to dine in high end establishments. It's more fun dining next door at L' Atelier.",

Every sense is stimulated.. I know I sound like a food snob, but the decor, ambiance, service and not to mention the16 course meal is perfect.  The service really is impecable and the breads are heavenly.  We particularly loved the gruyere brioche.  The amuse bouch was the only thing that I didn't love.  The 4th or 5th course was a Robuchon specialty of langostine ravioli with a fois gras reduction which was too die for.  My husband loved and the waygu beef course, I believe his exact words were \" I don't know if I've ever tasted anything before\".  It was expensive, $1100 after tax and tip for 2 but worth every penny.",

It was absolutely amazing.  I am not the biggest fan of truffles and all these dishes were fantastic. I cleaned my plate on each course. It was a ton of food. You think it really isn't because it looks so small when it comes out, but after the 3rd or 4th you wonder when will it ever stop? Everything is delicious and extravagent.  I probably will not ever eat here again simply because it's extremely expensive, but I am so happy I got to experience it. It truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget.",

But the highlight was the dessert/chocolate cart.  I read other people's reviews about only getting 5 items.  The BF and I definitely were not restricted, and we only did a 5-course tasting (we failed and went to a buffet earlier that day).  Delicious and a great place to for a special ocassion.

I ordered the full tasting menu, and sadly, could not make it through to the very end because I just couldn't physically fit in any more bites of food.   I'm not used to eating French food, so my body just wasn't capable of consuming such rich food and in that quantity.  Nearly everything was covered in edible gold leaf, truffles or caviar (no complaints there!)  My favorite was the lobster course which was divine.  I never experienced that level of preparation and creativity in food before.  And the presentation and service were meticulous. We plan on framing the menu and hanging it in our home.",

The restaurant interior is very classic parisian w/ touches of art deco.  The garden wall (18ft of corner to corner greens) is so beautiful and the ambience is elegant but not too stuffy.  The place taps into all the human senses perfectly. My only complaint was that it was too damn quiet in there.  Mind you, I'm a very  vocal person and so the place was just not conducive to demonstrating appropriate behavior given my experience at Joel Robuchon.  I think the good lord heard me call his name several times that night!  I had the 13-course tasting menu which sounded overwhelming but let 'tasting' be the operative word. Mushroom bisque, sea urchin, chilean seabass, tomato gelatin, kobe beef--it goes on and on--made w/ such craftsmanship and was ABSOLUTELY fabulous!!  The service was  exceptional, impeccable and in a class of its own.    Pastries and dessert by renowned Chef Kamel Guechida was the finale of my wonderful experience.

We got the limo service which is a must because they take you through the mansion which are the villas the high rollers stay in.  We got the 4 course meal which is $190 per person.  With drinks, tax, and tip, it comes out to about $250 per person.  So was the food worth it..... No.  But the food combined with the great service and overall experience.... I gotta say Yes.  Before your meal you get the bread cart which has all different kinds of bread depending on your taste.  After your meal you can ask for the tea cart.  They  have all kinds of green, black, and herbal teas to choose from.  Then the coup de grace is the mini dessert cart which will pretty much blow you away if you are not already.  The food was excellent, there is no doubt.  But it is my opinion that this joint is more about the experience than the actual meal.",

Whether you eat at the bar, or dine in the quiet, spacious salon Joel Robuchon is everything you've ever wanted in dining. The multiple course meals sound intimidating, making you fee like you need to fast before entering this chapel dedicated to worshiping fine dining.

When you're spending this kind-of money on food, you have to think of it is a culinary adventure and understand that there is NO \"bang for the buck\" value purchasing. If that is what you're looking for... check out the buffet!!!  That being said, this was a night we will remember well into our Alzheimer's years.  The complimentary limo ride was a great way to start the evening and gave us a glimpse at \"The Mansions\" area of the MGM (I didn't even know that area existed).  We were dropped-off at a reception area where the Maitre d met us and escorted us to the main dining room.  It was elegant, but not overly stuffy (and not as \"sterile\" as Guy Savoy).  The waiter was very French, but not snooty.  He engaged us in small talk and helped take the edge off of what could have been a very intimidating evening.  All of the food was wonderful.  The courses started \"light and bright\" and got progressively more savory.  The highlights were the langoustines (his signature dish) and the veal, but I enjoyed EVERYthing.  The only dish that left me scratching my head was the asparagus with caviar... it was just an odd pairing (however, it was the best taste of asparagus I've ever had).  It took us about 3.5 hours to work our way through all the courses and we were STUFFED when we left.  One way I try to justify the expense of dining at an upscale restaurant, is to ask myself: \"could I have made that at home?\".  The answer to that question is \"no\"... there is no way I have the access to the quality of the ingredients or the culinary skills required to prepare ANY of the dishes.  As long as you are prepared to drop a chunk of change for a meal, I could't recommend it more.",

However, the positives totally outweigh the negatives. Every bite was an insight into Chef Robuchon's mastery of modern French haute cuisine.

Not only because of the cost of the meal, but also the length and type of food too.  Our dinner lasted about 3 1/2 to 4 hours from start to finish.  The service was exceptional from the complimentary limo service, to the incredibly well trained and knowledgeable service staff.  Everyone around was was celebrating a special occasion as well, as indicated by the individual ice cream cake they would bring out for each table. (nice touch!) So we started off the meal with two delicious specialty cocktails. Mine was the one muddled with fresh raspberries and his was a bourbon martini of some sort.  Both delicious.  We ordered the four  course tasting menu with two half bottles of wine, one red one white.  It's really a four course menu with a bread cart, cheese cart, chocolate cart, personal icecream cake for special occasions or sorbet, dessert and they also send you home with a loaf of pistachio cranberry bread. wow, it's a LOT!   Everything that came out was visually spectacular, inventive and tasty with fancy foams and gelees.  The bread cart and cheese cart were amazing too.  My favorite dishes were probably the amuse bouche, the crab salad with caviar, and the turbot dish.",

    "text": "This is the first 3 Michellin star restaurant I had ever been to and it was truly the epitome of fine dining. When we went we had the tasting and some of the highlights were the  the Le Topinambour (Parmesan flan with sunchoke cream and duck confit), Le Bar (Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks), and the best dish was the L'Epaule d'Agneau (Braised Lamb shoulder flavored meridional spices with semolina and black truffles). The service was absolutely amazing and we were lucky enough to get a tour of the kitchen and I must say I was completely impressed with the speed and efficiency at which the kitchen worked. What was most amazing was the fact that the line was completely silent. Overal, a great experience......until we got our $1,400 bill. But it's only expected when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.",

    "text": "Beautiful Restaurant.  It surprised me how small the place was, but its inner decor makes it one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever been in. The central focus of purple really makes you feel like the royalty that donned such colors back in the day.  Once I ordered , they rolled in the infamous bread cart. I don't remember what exactly the name was, but one of the best breads I've ever had (I don't even like bread so this is a lot coming from me) is their small rosemary bun. They heat it up after you select your breads. I  asked for multiple breads and being a michelin restaurant, they graciously and happily showed me the bread cart multiple times.  The food is just beautiful. I don't need to go describing the food but just seeing the food makes anyone in their right mind want to eat the food. I don't really know whats in my food sometimes (dont quite understand the french accented waiters/watiresses) but it was nice to know that my food was elegantly made and can also be elegantly described. You can check out the menu online because honestly, whoever writes those menu's would be a Yelp-Champion. It doesn't add all this adjective mumbojumbo junk that I use, its just straight up food descriptions with appetizing syntax.  Something that got me way excited was that they started us off with a \"Caviar Surprise\" which was Caviar covering shredded crab meat.  A 3 star michelin restaurant, what I wanted it to be in my dreams and what I got in Las Vegas",

    "text": "This was one of the best dining experiences of my life.  The ambiance was whimsical and otherworldly :)  We had two servers, one male and one female.  Both were french speaking.  I love that!  We went for the four course fixed menu consisting of an appetizer, soup, main course and dessert.  The food was VERY rich in flavour as french cuisine is famous for.  The portions were tiny which I love because each dish was loaded with taste.  By the time dessert rolled around I was getting close to being full.  That didn't stop me though.  The female server rolled around a HUGE cart covered with perfect little desserts.  There were so many to choose from!  Heaven on wheels!  I didn't know which to select so I randomly chose.  Each and every bite was delicious.  At the end of the meal, the server fixed us a little goodie bag to take home with us.  She included beautiful bars of chocolate covered in gold and pink flakes.  This is as good as it gets all around.  Food, ambiance, service.. all top of the line.  This was a wonderful night.  If you want to surprise a special person in your life with a fancy dinner, this is the place to go.  Located in the MGM.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to JR and wow were we blown away, again. It was my boyfriends birthday so we flew out and were picked up in a gold MGM limo. We walked through the \"MGM Mansion\" which is off limits to the public. I guess it's only for the high rollers and guests of Joel Robuchon. It's utterly incredible. From beginning to end. When we arrived we were seated at our favorite table. The decor at this place is something out of a French palace. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu. The food looks small but oh boy do you get full. By the third course we had to adjust our clothes. Before your food is served they hall this bread cart to your table. This bread cart is every bread lovers dream. The cart had over 25 different breads, even the butter was delicious. We enjoyed every course especially the truffled ravioli's and the duck breast with goose foie gras. They have the best foie gras I have ever tasted. I think goose foie gras is better than duck foie gras. I put in a note for the maitre d to tell the waiter is was my boyfriends bday. After dessert they brought my boyfriend this little white cake. It was big enough for three people. The cake was absolutely delicious. It was the best cake of my life. I think I want to celebrate every bday at Joel Robuchon. After we finished his bday cake they wheeled out the dessert cart. I already had a sugar comma from the cake but there was no way I was going to say no to that dessert cart. There are desserts flown in from France and Switzerland but most of them are made there. They are all so delicious. This place is not cheap but it is definitely work every last cent. Expect to pay $400+. When you leave they give you a bag with a treat from the chef. We received an amazing raspberry pistachio cake. We devoured it with green tea the next morning. I will be back every year. I hope to visit the location in Paris someday.",

    "text": "When my kids are teasing each other and their friends \"would you rather kiss a pig or eat at Joel Robuchon\" even zero stars would be too many.  I'm not sure how anyone in their right mind would give this place 5 stars unless they just want to pretend that they went to an awesome place that no mere mortal will afford and can't discover the truth.  We didn't mind paying just to see the place and experience supposedly the best food by the chef of the century, but the whole deal was a 4-hour ceremony during which a few classy butlers pretend to give you something to eat while you're supposed to pretend that it's good. Literally each and every course was the size of a scallop with one of the courses actually being exactly one scallop and another one was one mashroom. If brought together at once the total size of the 16-course meal we had would be smaller than a kids meal at any other restaurant. Adding to the insult was that most of these items were inedible, we came home hungry and just warmed up whatever we found in our fridge.  Let's start with the look: the place looks simply tacky with its classical decor mismatched to the partially modern ceiling, the oversized chandelier overpowering the small room, the purple sofas that seem to be bought from Hugh Heffner, and cheap looking fake plastic diamonds sprinkled on the dining tables. But that's forgivable given that we came here to eat, not to admire the settings.  We decided on two of the 16-course $385 meals which was recommended by so many other reviewers, assuming that our two kids will also taste some dishes. First, the butler brings a large block of butter and shaves a few pieces onto a plate while explaining that the butter is from Great Britain. Then he brings a large cart with selection of 16 different breads, which look and smell great but you can't really eat them because they ask you to select a few kinds and when you point to the 3 or 4 that look most interesting they drop one small slice of each on your table and quickly haul the cart away. You won't see it again. You then spread the English butter onto the bread and find out that the butter tastes just like any butter, whether from Guatemalan or a local cow. The bread itself was quite good and possibly one of the best items of the evening, however, you can go down to the M Resort buffet and get as much of the similar and better breads as you want and keep coming back for more. Here with the bread we also got a small portion of caviar on top of rolled crab meat. The caviar must've been the most expensive tasteless item we had there, but the canned crab meat was decent. The next couple courses included another outrageously expensive and highly sought item: shaved truffles. We were trying to discover what's so distinct about them but the only thing we discovered was taste of a shaved tree bark, actually looking just like that as well. Of course we have never tasted tree bark before but we could imagine that it'd taste just like these truffles. The rest of the weird dishes included a tiny frog leg, a scallop, and other Lilliput size items, the worse being bacon foam that tasted just like warm whipped fat from the bacon - something so awful it should've been offered in a food eating competition on CBS Survivor. After spending 3.5 hours at this torturous ceremony we finally arrived at the end of the tunnel as the butler brought a desert cart filled with variety of chocolates and cake pieces. Although each one was the size of 5 stacked up pennies we already figured out the game and asked for a sample of each. The butler looked at us and said \"all 40 of them\"? We all replied \"Yes!\" and finally started enjoying ourselves by swallowing each piece while the butler was placing it on the table. We only asked not to be given any of the pieces containing alcohol, so the total count was about 30. Not by any means does this mean that we got what we paid for but at least we had 5 minutes of enjoyment and wished that the whole experience was like that. This was also the first time I saw smiles on my kids' faces (aged 8 and 12).  We were prepared to spend around $1000 and the bill was little below $900, so no problem there. Although the fact that our kids were charged $7 for each of the Sprite refills ($28 for four) should be noted.  Finally, we were given a bag with small box of desert pieces and two beautiful certificates of attendance with our names on them and the list of all 16 courses we were supposed to enjoy. We were also given a nice color brochure with pictures of each those items. All this looks prettyf, but at the same time embrassing - like being given a certificate of investing with Madoff. You could show it off only until everyone else figures out that Madoff was a crook.  In the end we will remember this place as one of the worst experiences of our lives and we would not go there again even if the food was free. Giving one star to this place is way too generous, while two stars would be just insane.",

It began with an escorted limo ride to a private entrance of the MGM property, the Mansions.  Our host met us and walked us through the beautiful property to the restaurant where we were greeted by a warm and friendly young woman who then walked us to our table for two on the terrace-which was gorgeous.  The food began with an amuse of caviar served in our own individual tins with the Robuchon logo. It was superb.  The bread cart of 14 offerings was fabulous, and the waiter heated our selections.  Our starters and entrees were cooked exactly as we specified.   Both the beef and fish entrees were a delight to the tastebuds along with buttery mashed potatoes. The dessert was provided on the house since it was my husband's birthday. It was a delicious layered cake topped with meringue and cream plated on a stream of fresh apricot sauce.  Our French press coffee service was accompanied by miniature desserts most of which were exquisite chocolates and fruits.  We were allowed as many as we wanted.  I was also given a gift of Robuchon chocolate in the signature bag as a great take away.  Service was impeccable.  This is a destination restaurant.  Throw financial caution to the wind and enjoy every bit of it.",

    "text": "The first thing anyone who eats here should do is ... a little research.  One of the main features of eating at this restaurant is the open kitchen.  The couple who were sat next to us were flabbergasted that they had to sit at the bar and were surprised at the menu options!  WTF?    The food and service here were really good.  We each had the fixed price ($135 per person) discovery menu.  People have done justice to the descriptions in other reviews below so I won't bore you with a similar description.  Our favorites were the roasted rack of milk fed lamb and the cappuccino of green asparagus with black truffle and parmesan foam.    Few items to note that haven't been emphasized are: the prices of wine are HIGHLY over inflated.  We ordered a Spanish bottle for $70.00 (that retails in Lee's for $15.00) so, just be aware as this is typical.  The food came out really quickly at the beginning and we asked our waiter to slow down the pace and he gladly did so.  Dress code advised is business casual and that people were dressed anywhere from t-shirts and jeans to suits.    I think that the tasting menu is a great introduction to the restaurant.  On our next visit I will definitely order from the a la carte menu.     Lastly, this was an excellent experience at the restaurant of the \"Chef of the Century\" and will remain memorable for many years to come.",

I think what I found most surprising was that our waiter was attentive, very knowledgeable, but extremely down to earth and completely unpretentious.  I think this definitely put me at ease and I was better able to enjoy the food and not feel bad about asking a dumb question!  But you know it's going to be ridiculously awesome meal when the amuse bouche is caviar with crab!  Of course, I had to try La Langoustine and it was unbelievable - I can still recall the taste of the truffles.  The braised veal cheeks were soft as butter and the mashed potatoes were silky smooth!  The bread, cheese, and dessert carts were awesome.  Will you drop some serious cash here?  Yes, but if you enjoy food, it's worth every penny!  Lastly, Joel Robuchon was in Vegas that night and we actually got to meet him!  He was speaking with some French patrons so we didn't think he would stop over at our table of obvious American clods, but he was gracious and even posed for a picture!",

In addition, the waiting staffwas friendly, but not pretentious.

The only thing that could be improved is finding some other way to affix the dishes to the serving platters besides make me a double loop of scotch tape, but there was nothing disappointing out of all the 15 courses.The black cod it was amazing, and the truffle corn puree was out of this world. Even though we had 15 courses, they left plenty of time in between courses and you were not feeling overly stuffed.although the price tag is high, compared to other three Michelin star restaurants, it is well worth it at least once. You won't be disappointed if you choose to get the 15 course tasting menu.",

    "text": "It has been too long since I went (Valentine's Day) to write a proper review and account for everything, so right now I can only talk about what I still remember: the highlights.  The bread cart is awe-inspiring.  There were four types of brioche alone, as well as every other type of bread you could dream of.  The brioche, by the way, melts in your mouth, morsel by morsel.  Our appetizer/amuse bouche was a citrus flan/sangria flavored concoction, which emitted its own dry-ice fog, as if it were a present from a forest nymph.    I had the lobster and artichoke salad, which was tender and light, the chesnut soup with foie gras and bacon froth, which is just as it sounds (clean, deep with flavor and amazing), and then the spiny lobster with yuka root in green curry.  The only issue I had was that the spiny lobster in curry was a little salty.  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate souffle because that is my favorite thing in the whole world, and the only place besides Les Souffles in Paris that can make a good one in the States is Gary Danko.  By this point, we were way too full to possibly enjoy the souffle, and they even went so far as to roll around the dessert cart with 50 some desserts on it, so we first sampled those (they're all good), and then they gave us sorbets because the souffle was taking a long time.  I felt like I was having a heart attack trying to spoon the rich chocolate souffle with gooey chocolate liquid inside into my mouth.  It's delicious, don't get me wrong, but I don't recommend getting any dessert; the cart is plenty.    The service was just impeccable, I couldn't help but clap or laugh whenever they brought out a new thing, it was magical, romantical!  Best restaurant I've been to in America, even better than French Laundry, dare I say it?  It was the bread cart. :*)",

The bread cart makes you want to keep asking for more the caviar dish is sublime, the tasting menu does get a bit over the top.  I like to describe the menu like waves of cuisine crashing into your soul relelntlessly battering you into submission to remember each and every wave of divine french cuisine.    I only regret going there on the first day of a 5 day trip but making the reservation for 8 pm (EST was 11pm), by the time we finished the meal it was around 11pm.   It was a little late for us and had to order some espresso to finish the entire tasting.    Once again pricey but for the experience you should try this once, hell maybe even twice.  I would also suggest L'atelier because it is also a show but again worth every penny!    Cheer and happy eats!  P.S.  if you have a reservation and are not staying at the MGM...THEY( Robuchon) will send a limo for you there and back....DEFINITELY a nice touch for Vegas this is  must!",

The food was among the best that I've had anywhere and certainly the best in Las Vegas, and that's saying something, with the long list of great restaurants in the city.  The langoustine ravioli was a dish I will remember 5 years from now.  The bread cart had some of the best bread on it I've ever had.  The ambiance was so beautiful that I couldn't believe I was inside the MGM-Grand.  The service was as good as I've had.  But oh, the price.  Don't get me wrong - I've eaten at a lot of very expensive, very nice restaurants in my time, but this is in a different league for pricing.  The tasting menu there, at almost $400 is twice what some of the best restaurants in the world charge.  Is it worth twice what Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se and El Celler de Can Roca charge for their food?  I don't think so, hence the 4 star rating.  If you are a whale and have an unbelievable comp balance come here.  If you are foodie, you have to do JR at least once.  But I couldn't see coming here with any regularity.",

However, we asked to order more wine and then no one ever returned to take our order. We were also seated in a back shadowy corner. The main part of the restaurant looked lovely and appeared to have nice ambiance. For the price I would likely not return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm not sure where to find the words to describe the best food & dining experience of my life. This was my second 3-star Michelin restaurant (French Laundry being the 1st, which I did NOT like) -- but having watched 'Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, Paris' episode, where Joel Robuchon was cited as the 'Chef of the Century,' and saw how much he is regarded in the culinary world, my curiosity was piqued, and my expectations were high.   And my, did they exceed any expectation I could have come up with. A SIXTEEN course VEGETARIAN tasting menu -- omg. My family debated whether or not they could handle that food ... but being pregnant I a) am eating for two, and b) am not drinking, which leaves A LOT more room in your stomach for food -- so I was the first to decide that the 16 course tasting menu was the way to go.   Out of all 16 dishes, I would say that only 2 were mediocre -- everything else that went into my mouth was FREAKIN AMAZING. A new burst of flavors every time. Their bread selection was incredible -- their gruyere bread, saffron bread, and one more cheese bread was to die for.   After 4 hours of eating the most delectable dishes unimaginable to me ... we were showed a cart of over 40 petit fours!! We each filled ourselves mini-boxes of goodies to enjoy for the days to come. Because we had gone there to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday, we not only had the two dessert courses on the menu, but they had also made an extra birthday cake for us (ice cream cake of sorts) ... God it was good.   And then they let us take home our leftover cheese which we couldn't finish, and gave us amazing lemon cakes as goody bags -- which we ate for days to come.   Though it was $400/person ... I will always make it a point to eat at Joel Robuchon's whenever I visit Vegas!",

    "text": "A 3 star Michelin restaurant that lives up to the hype not only in the service and ambiance but the food itself screams ingenuity.   Fancy, beautiful & quite extraordinary.  The foyer alone gives you an idea of what's to come.  After hearing about this place from my bff who is a regular patron, I made reservations about 4 months in advance for my 10 year wedding anniversary.   I felt elevated here. The food was exceptional and our 5 course meal left us with a deeper appreciation for the craft that goes into creating these unique dishes.    We chose the 5 course dinner which was perfect, but there is also a 16 course dinner for the truly indulgent.  The 5 course dinner lasted about 4 hours. Everything is carried out to your table on a huge silver platter and presented to you one by one with a full description by the Maitre d'.   From the champagne to the Foie Gras to the Black Cod, the Filet Mignon And Ravioli...everything was magnifique! The menu often changes, but one of their signature dishes is La Langoustine and let me tell you..it was superb!  There is an assortment of bread & regionally imported cheese cart floating around as well as a beautiful dessert cart with truffles and edible gold.  These added treats served well in between courses and with our coffee/tea.  The executive chef, Claude Le Tohic personally came out to see how our dining experience turned out and was more than happy to take photos with us on our special occasion.  We were then gifted with a bag of chocolates and a special anniversary dessert topped with candles. It truly was a once in a lifetime experience....the bill will confirm that in the end but I hope to return and be elevated here again.",

    "text": "Instead of going into endless detail (we had the 15 course tasting menu with base wine pairings, $750 each without tax or tip), I am just going to say that the food was as expected; nothing less, nothing more.  It was artfully executed, and nicely balanced.  Not sure you really needed teeth to enjoy each soft portion of goodness, all the same temp (lukewarm) and same texture (soft).  Piece after piece of tasty bites, teeny tiny little bites.  Not to say the dinner wasn't delightful.  But it takes a lot of delight to warrant $750+ each.  Joel Robuchon is one of the top 25 most costly restaurants in the country, we just expected more.  The restaurants we enjoyed in Paris were so much more reasonable, the food much more exciting.  The wine pairings offered with the 15 course tasting were fine, but not noteworthy.  The Champagne was lovely, the Sauvignon wonderful.  From the Chardonnay forward, we found the selections rather disappointing.  If you are staying in MLife properties, be sure to expense it to your room for point value if you track that sort of thing.  We did not know this was an option until we saw it printed on our receipt, but it was too late; they would not switch the charge to our room.  That was ok with us, we just didn't realize how many hotels were affiliated with MLife.    The limo drivers both ways (complementary pick up and drop off service from your hotel) were personable and fun; however, our servers were quite the opposite; very stuffy, they do not crack a smile, ours was very cold.  I am not a fan of servers hovering nearby, staring as you eat, ready to whisk plates away as soon as you lay down your fork, it felt intrusive.   This was a splurge on our part, we both adore French cuisine.  When asked, \"still or sparking water?\", expect that still means bottled at $10 each.  You must specifically ask for tap water which is free of course, but they did not offer this until we had finished two bottles.  Have to mention the bacon bread, amazing, don't miss it.  They sent us home with a strange tasting citrus pound cake, didn't care for it.  Another yelper said to try the tea, I had the Assam tea, it was quite unremarkable.  Not our favorite dining experience, we would not return; too many other fine dining restaurants to choose from.  I'm glad we tried it, scratching it off our bucket list.",

The tasting menu the second time around was too full of truffles and foie gras and seemed centered around those ingredients which was disappointing considering the varied and adventurous makeup of the former tasting menu. However, this restaurant is what it is and as far as Michelin rated french, you're not going to get better than this aside from Jean Georges in NYC. The only downside to this restaurant is that it's located in the MGM Grand when it really belongs in the Wynn or Bellagio. Even its proximity to the Mansion does not cure this handicap. A side note- please, no matter how many millions you are worth, show the class that this restaurant is worth and wear a suit and tie. Most don't and it's disrespectful. I once made mention of it to the host, Bernard, and he quietly smiled and advised that were this France, many guests would not have been admitted due to manner of dress. Indeed. I even observed one man on his cellphone while the host was explaining the menu. Alas, it is True that class is taught, not bought.",

The limo pickup & subsequent stroll through the MGM Mansions are nice tourist touches, but a restaurant experience really begins as you walk into the restaurant.   The venue is as luxurious, opulent & as formal as you will find in a dining establishment, anywhere in the world. This is True for the decor, the personnel & most importantly, the food. So yes, you should dress accordingly.   It's worth noting that the service throughout our evening, while formal, was extremely welcoming, friendly & created new meaning for the word \"attentive\".  If you don't want to do the 18 course Chef's tasting menu, then you are making a mistake. It is beyond spectacular. The presentation, the creativity & the taste of each & every dish is seriously impeccable.    I will conclude by saying that this is simply the finest restaurant that I have ever eaten at.",

    "text": "As part of my bucket list I plan to visit all the Three Michelin starred restaurants in the US, and what a restaurant to start with.  First, let me start with, this experience is not for the faint of heart!  You need to go in expecting to spend quite a bit of money, if you can't afford it (I saved up for a year! :)) then there are plenty of amazing, less expensive eateries in Vegas.  However, if you're looking for a culinary journey, read on.  First, the biggest fear going into the restaurant for me, was the atmosphere, would the other guests stare at me as I delightfully photographed all 16 courses? Would the waiter scoff when I ordered my normal Diet Coke?  There was none of it, the guests next to us actually got a kick out of my goofiness and the waiter cracked quite a few jokes of his own.  I felt completely at ease.  The bread cart started off the experience in full grand style, it was 20 types of bread, all craftily made and carefully explained by our waiter.  After making our choices it was quickly whisked away and warmed for us.    Then came 16 courses of amazing'ness.  I won't bother explaining the play by play for the courses, but each one was a masterpiece.  At 4 hours for a dinner duration, we found ourselves reminiscing about courses that occurred earlier in the meal (hahah, we thought that was amusing).    If you're a fan of cooking shows, the ingredients were all the things we hear about but never dare try... Truffles (amazing I tell you!), Foi Gras (Meh... I could take it or leave it), Caviar, Sea Urchin and the list goes on and on :)  A three Michelin star restaurant should be a restaurant you're willing to take a special journey for.  Joel Robuchon's qualifies for its rating and is worth your time and money.    Thank you!",

My husband ordered the lobster dish with some stuffed seafood items. These aren't your regular portions, they are smaller but very filling. They offer a great selection of breads and after dinner chocolates. They also gave us the most decadent, buttery, creamy mashed potatoes I have ever had!  The staff was nice enough but a bit stiff. Our waiter was really friendly and made me feel more welcome. Thanks! Watching the staff was like watching a choreographed dance. They even took our coats and scarves!   At the end of the night we were given a bag with chocolate and a mini book with pictures of the restaurant. Overall the food was delicious and we enjoyed ourselves but at about $500 for 2 people I'm afraid we can't afford to come back. If we win the lottery we'll be back :)",

Obviously, every single team member who assists with the service here must have years of experience. That is why we were perplexed at the bush league mistake of the Maitre D.  From the time we walked in to the moment we walked out, the Maitre D made it a point to stare throughout our meal at Lip's Shoes. Yes, no joke, at Lips' Shoes. It was obvious to the point of feeling uncomfortable. Then, it really made it uncomfortable.  As we were walking out, the Maitre D made what we thought was a very unprofessional statement to us. And I quote, \"wow, your shoes are very Shiny.\"  What the hell is that supposed to mean? The shoes were this years Gucci. Did he mean it as a compliment or was it meant as a put down?  I took it as a less than professional statement. Could I be mistaken? Yes. However if a statement by an employee could be taken as an insult, one would think the Maitre D would not have made a statement which could be misunderstood.   1500 for two. Would we go back.

    "text": "97% Easily one of the best French tasting dinners.  ***Short Review  Came here for dinner on Jul '11 on a weekday night.  Food here is consistently impressive. They do a great job with everything, but I felt their forte and emphasis was seafood. I enjoyed their sea urchin with fennel foam in particular. The cooking here is creative, and dishes are very well calculated. Flavors are paired well and dishes are refined.  Although the food is mainly French, there are some clear international influences. Presentation of dishes are attractive. Wine pairings are pretty good, even if not the very best. Bread tray and heavenly 'butter' are not to be missed. Desserts are very solid.  Tried their killer 16 course, seasonally themed tasting dinner @ $395/person Value is very reasonable if you can go easy on the wine pairings. I opted for a glass of champagne and six glasses of wine, which cost me another $150-200 more.  Service is very good, not the very best but certainly close. Decor is elegant and very well designed with high ceilings and vibrant blues and greens. It is very comfortable without pretense.  The Michelin Stars are fully deserved here.  Did not need to make reservations far ahead of time. I called the restaurant an hour ahead of time, despite Robuchon's website being cryptic about the availability of seating. Robuchon and 'L'Atelier' next door were not very busy.  Detailed review will go more in depth with each course. Pictures are included.  ***Detailed Review.  I very much enjoyed the cooking at Robuchon.  I felt that there was a lot of work dedicated towards the design and execution of  dishes.  Flavors and dishes here were pretty diverse, if not slightly exhausting towards the end.  If there was a theme, I would say that all dishes were remarkably light.  The style of preparation is very modern without being too experimental or risky.  Everything here is calculated well, and they don't falter on execution.  The dishes that worked were nothing short of heavenly  The weaker dishes were still very good.  The food here, while definitely not accessible to all, should be satisfying to most who enjoy tasting dinners.     Although the style of preparation is unmistakably French, many ingredients and ideas are very international.  The implementation is impressively seamless, so they seldom will feel out of place.  If anything, I felt the tasting lacked dishes you may expect at a French restaurant.  For instance, there was no foie gras, duck, or more traditional desserts.   I started out with the bread cart & a glass of champagne as recommended by my sommalier to start.  As mentioned by prior reviews, there are numerous bread choices here.  It's very tempting to go all out.  Considering the high number of courses, I felt it would be best to consider some self-restrain here. I opted for something simple and light.  Went with the a brioche roll, slice of baguette & olive oil bread.  Bread here are nicely delicate and delicious.  What stood out was the butter.  I believe it was imported from the Normandy region of France.  It is very luxurious.  Rich, smooth, and very very tasty.  Most delicious butter ever.

Young almonds are the 'chips' and have a nice crunch.  Avocado is pureed very finely and spiced The tomato pulp is essentially served as a jelly underneath.  Everything is spiced well with the coriander and maybe some other spices (I'm guessing cumin?).  Fun dish, interesting and tasty.

This was back when I still ate meat and am I ever glad I got to try this before I got converted being immersed in the \"vegan, organic, go-green\" side of LA too long.   The bite-size piece of kobe beef must have been the best tasting bite of meat I've ever had.  Everything from beginning to end was exquisite. Definitely one of those experiences you don't want to die without trying. Oh and a glass or two of Caymus 2006 vintage cabernet (unbelievably smooth and pairs well with most of the dishes) just makes the night in heaven all that much more dreamy!",

Joel R came back from retirement to open this amazing restaurant in Las Vegas and I'm glad he did! so If you want to spend some extra money and treat your palate You have to go and experience this restaurant",

    "text": "How could this place be anything but perfect? The entire experience was over the top, and when I felt as if there was no where left to go, we went over the top again. Spherical thin sugar skinned creamy blueberry dessert thing - that's all I can say. How do you get cream into a huge sugar sphere, that's hollow by the way...who knows. How do you make it taste amazing? Only they know. Every course, every bite, every trip to the bathroom....even the one where I decided it was time to loose the spanx, was incredible and memorable. It's maybe the most expensive dinner I've ever had, (maybe) Guy Savoy in Paris was crazy too, but this place was actually just as good, but the experience in Paris was better - it's Paris. So, yes, I recommend going at least once to experience this kind of \"food\" if you want to call it that - it is truly ART before it is food.  The bread, the butter, the petite fours, the cheese, the everything.  The atmosphere was quite stale, but not in a bad way...just understand that this place does swanky in a whole different way. It is not a loud place you go to to check out the scene or people watch. It is super quiet and discreet and rather boring from that perspective. Go here to fill your face and be prepared to pay a bill as big as your monthly mortgage, and don't flinch, just do it.",

Luckily it was a good choice for a special occasion.   The dining room is a feast for the eyes without feeling too stuffy. The service was polite but they adapted and became more relaxed when they saw we were out for some fun. And of course, the food was great.   As we were planning a night of Vegas-style debauchery after, we didn't want too crazy a tasting menu and opted for one of the smaller ones. Starting with a refreshing cherry gazpacho, I moved onto lobster salad with cauliflower veloute, daikon radish soup (which was richer and better than it sounded, or the alternative pea soup), duck with foie (defibrillator anyone?), and chocolate souffle (heavenly).   The sommelier picked a great pairing for our diverse courses. The bread cart and mignardaise cart were mind blowing. And we topped the visit off with a kitchen tour. They send you home with a chocolate bar and a booklet about the restaurant (basically some food porn) so you can relive the experience.  So why only 4 stars? It was comfortable but nothing necessarily life-altering. But still a very good choice if you happen to win big and treat yourself :)",

When I go to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant for the first time, I expect the meal to be filled with wonder and amazement.  My expectations were not met here.  I will say my Michelin Star restaurant experience, prior to coming here has been limited to most of the places in NYC and a few blocks away at Guy Savoy (which I feel is a better restaurant).    I had the 16 course tasting menu and everything was beautifully plated, but I did not have 1 \"WOW\" moment.  I also didn't understand the egg dish.  It was just a rubbery poached egg that was VERY round.    The bread cart was nice, but not superior.  The only item I felt like they did an exceptional job on was the full sized baguette, but at the end of the day, I didn't pay a large sum of money to eat bread.  I have the same comments about the dessert cart.  My plate was filled with items that I only nibbled on.  There was not one item I felt compelled to finish.         The previous sentence sums up my feelings on Joel Robuchon, it is nice, but I do not feel compelled to return.    Service was very good and decor was definitely the best out of any restaurant I have ever been in.",

The service was good, but, being trained in front of the house for high end restaurants, I can't help but take notice of some glaring mistakes.  Ones that wouldn't bother me if we were having a $150 pp meal... But at $400~ pp I expect perfection.  While training, my professor said, that the course would ruin many of my dining experiences, and well... This is one of them...   Examples:  I asked a server/back server for more bread - #1 I should have been offered more bread, I should not have had to ask.  #2 \"No Problem\" - My training has taught me to hate that phrase... When was it ever a problem? #3 When we got our first order of bread, they took it back into the kitchen to heat, so we had warm, tasty breads to enjoy, upon our second and third orders, the bread was not heated, and was cold.  Where is the consistency?  Next was the atmosphere: It was great... Modern French... Reminded me of some of the wineries and French country houses I've dined at in that part of the world. But there were the table mats...  The goddamned table mats, while very pretty were painful... Made of this hard plastic substance... They were pokey and went the length of the table... Had I been wearing a sports coat, I may not have noticed, but it's Vegas, Summer's beginning and it's 90 degrees outside... And the restaurant seems to have a casual \"don't dress like an asshole\" dress code, so I was wearing a short buttoned up shirt.  And the mats were relentless like wasps into my arms...  Well, that's my rant...  All in all, I did really enjoy our experience... It would have been very hard to complain about if I hadn't ruined future dining experiences by studying the subject.  And I feel bad about rating only 3 stars, but at the price point, I feel like everything should be perfect.",

Yes, it was 3 hrs plus dinner - Easily the longest meal for us the short attention span, MTV generation. But the visual excitement of each dish, savoring confluence of flavors, attentive service and the luxurious decor made the whole experience enjoyable. Even the bread & dessert cart were cute!  Now, my beef? I would have ordered chocolate souffle if I had that choice in dessert. For the price of $xxx per person, you would think that would be the case. But by the time dessert rolled over - after like 15 plates - does it really matter what is in front of you? Maybe not.   At the end of this enjoyable dinner, we were presented with a summary of menu wrapped in purple sash ribbon marking the occassion and a delightful parting gift in... was it in a purple/ lilac bag? Yes, I get it. Monsieur Robuchon likes purple! ~.~  Can't wait till next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes at Joel Robuchon!",

First and foremost the place is AMAZING!!! You will be ruined after you go here...   Ok... When you call to make your reservations... ask about the Limo service. You have to know where you are staying so they can pick you up. It's FREE and you have to call back a week before your reservation to confirm your limo ride. It's totally worth it... They drop you off at the MGM Mansion and you get a peek at what the rich people get to experience. The air even smells better in there. It's a round trip ride and remember to tip!    I have gotten both the 4 course meal and 16 course. GET THE 16!!! Trust me it's worth it... more food for your $.   Bread Cart- They are gonna offer you so many breads it's overwhelming. Get as many as you want! They warm the bread for you... only the first time! If you want more warm bread... you have to ask them to do it.   If you don't get the 16 course.... they have a lot of add on items like truffle and stuff... which cost an extra $40.... so be aware.   They charge for water... I think it's $10 for still water... Soda $7... Huge selection of wine.  Fromage/ Cheese Cart- It's either 6 or 7 pieces of cheese for $30.  They also have a Tea Cart, Cognac Cart, Butter/ Olive Oil Cart, and Dessert Cart.   Butter and Olive/ Oil Cart and Dessert Cart are included with every meal get as much as you want.   At the beginning of the meal order the souffle!!! If you don't... by the end of your meal... you will be so full and you won't order it and I heard it's worth it. I think it's around $50.   When you call to make reservations always tell them you are celebrating something... cause they give you a free slice of cake to everyone at the table. It's a Ice Cream Meringue cake...so good!!!   And then when you leave they give you a free gift... it can be a loaf of bread, candy... it just depends on what they are making... And you get a menu of everything you ate! Yum!   Lastly... Have fun... it's a little intimidating when you go in... but don't worry about it... be loud and have a blast! =) Remember to bring a lot of $$$$$$!!! Tip and Tax will be a lot. Good Luck!!!",

We made a reservation in this beautiful restaurant for the 16 course tasting menu. (Who would even know that 8 course was more than enough). The delicious portions were very small but somehow we could only spare space for 10...I wish I tried some of the deserts that were offered in a beautiful setting. The quality of the food could not be better. The restaurant staff is very professional. Outstanding wine list. The decor makes you feel super important and high fashion. Although it is rather costly but it was worth every penny. They also gave us some Joel Robuchon signature chocolates.",

    "text": "I am a repeated customer because I was very impressed with my first dinner there years ago. This time, unfortunately, it was a BIG disappointment. I had the 6 course dinner last time so this time, I tried the full tasting menu. The first appetizer caviar with crab was to die for, the other 3 cold appetizers came as a trio on the same setting and that was still very nice but then it started downhill from there. This is supposedly to be a fine dining restaurant, meaning one should be able to take the time to enjoy each course without feeling being rushed. However, I can see the next course already was sitting on a table nearby and our waiters can wait for us to finish so they can serve the next dish. What bothered me more is they would serve 3 hot entree on a trio so by the time I finished the first one, the second and third one is cold already. Also, a well planned menu should go from light to heavy taste. With the trio serving, no one cares to tell us which one to start with first so if you happen to choose a heavy tasting one first, the others would be very blend. When a guy in a suite called Bernard came by to ask how we enjoyed our meal, I didn't hesitate to tell him how I felt we were being rushed and how it is totally a waste of the food by serving them all at the same time. He said Chef Robuchon was there in March and he decided to change how the tasting menu should be served. His comments were UNBELIVABLY ridiculous \" Well, what can I say, you can't argue with the chef. Maybe you can eat faster !!\"\" Excuse me, I didn't feel $500 ( before tips and wine ) so I can eat faster and having food served in a bento box. Given he may not agree with his boss BUT please give me a better response than asking me to eat faster. On the other hand, our server, David was just WONDERFUL, I believe he cared enough to listen and share my comments with Chef Clud so the next courses came out in a more reasonable pace and the chef himself did apologize and offered us the cheese plate and extra dessert. On the positive side, the dessert was way better than our previous meal and David did tell me they have a change of pastry chef.   So overall, Bernard's comments, the way they served their meal is NO WHERE close to what a Michelin 3 star restaurant should be. I have eaten at many Michelin star restaurants before and unfortunately this is the worst so far",

Reading that a majority of the reviews on YELP and elsewhere online were 5-stars, we decided on JR while we were in Vegas.   Call to reserve  the complimentary limousine service- totally worth it and you get to experience the MGM Mansion entrance. Restaurant service was severely lacking. We waited for 15 minutes just for the wine/cocktail menu although we were the only table in the restaurant with one other party of 8 in a side room. Additionally, we had to ask for beverages and water refills.  When we asked the waiter to bring specific cocktails at the time of entree service, they arrived two courses early with the excuse that the dining room director instructed her to bring them early, which was awkward.   Menu explanations were thorough as were the food descriptions at the time of service. The only True disappointment was the food. It just wasn't WOW worthy (typical of most French food). Plating was not creative nor inspirational.  The added caviar course was delicious, but how can you go wrong with caviar at $350/ounce??  All in all, we do not think the universal experience was worth the $1,036 final bill (including 20% gratuity).   L2O in Lincoln Park, Chicago still reigns supreme in all dining experiences (at 1/2 the cost of JR). Check out our review for L2O and make sure you visit if you're ever in Chicago!!",

Took a quick tour of the place and went to the restaurant.   After we ordered our food, they brought out the bread cart and it was AMAZING! At least 10 selections of awesome breads with butter hand churned from England or something. Just amazing.   Our dishes themselves were unbelievable, everything was just soo delicious.

Thereby bypassing the annoying sounds and confused people on the casino floor. It is about a 10 minute walk ladies with heels. Graciously seated they know you are coming and direct you right to your table. There are a few different tasting menus available of two, four, six, and 16 at 135, 168, 215 and 385 respectively. An amuse-bouche, bread, petit fours and coffee or tea accompanies all meals. It is prudent now to discuss the bread. Served on a cart trolley there are about 2 dozen lovely varies of bread to choose from. General you take three different kinds in the beginning. Once chosen your bread is taken in the back to be warmed and whisked back to you in a moment. The butter is shaved off a block and while lovely it is cold. I dislike cold butter for bread.  The menu doesn't change too much from week to week. Changes are mainly substations based on availability. The food is excellent. There wasn't a dish I didn't care for. From plating to palette, from texture to temperature the food was excellent. Portions were a touch too large for me but I prefer smaller portions in general.  The meal closes with a petit fours trolley of four dozen or so sweets to tempt you as you swirl down the last of your wine. More decadent then the bread trolley and all the more enticing. It is an exhausting delicious list.  I nearly forgot about the booze. Yes there are the perfunctory wine pairings. They also have several available by glass, half bottle and bottle. The cocktails are available but not very good. As a cocktail dork I would suggest sticking with wine here.  Service is generous and kind. All requests are taken with earnest and if at all possible fulfilled.  Is it worth it? Absolutely. I certainly look forward to having another meal here.",

    "text": "This was probably the best meal of my life!  I had the 16 course menu back in January 2008, and it was phenomenal.  Probably the most expensive meal of my life, but you only live once, right?  The Robuchon style is very elegant and sophisticated yet fun and whimsical at the same time.  Where else can you find strange little baubles and ribbon on your table and plate?  Presentation seems wacky if you pick pieces apart, but put it all together, and it works.    I ate during truffle season!  This is the way to go-- wait for the truffle menu to come around.  The truffle tart was outrageous.  The bread cart and dessert trolley make the meal beyond great.  Where else does this happen?  (A side note: I ate at the French Laundry less than a month before Robuchon, and Robuchon blew FL out of the water.  At Robuchon I had 16 courses plus a bread trolley, sorbet and petit four trolley in 3 hours; at the Laundry we had 14 courses in 5 hours.  The French Laundry was seriously lagging and everything was sooo rich, we were full halfway through.  Unlike the French Laundry, the flow of service and amount of food at Robuchon were perfect.)  Robuchon is a fantastic place to eat.  It's not just a restaurant, it's an experience.",

I would detail everything I had, but it's not necessary. Be surprised when you go. Be enchanted.   Harley, the wine director, was a class act, even when I accidentally called him Harvey.   The only beef I had was with the decor. Think \"mid-90s Disney movie set in Renaissance-era France,\" and don't be surprised if the chairs and candelabras start dancing and serving you food.

Upon reading the reviews and tips on Yelp (and very happy we did), we called ahead and had a limo picked us up from Bellagio where we were staying. It was fun riding in a limo with the license plate MGM2 (we later found MGM1 and took a picture with it).  Just a couple of turns from the usual streets, the limo drove us through the huge gate into this beautiful courtyard. We were led through the private VIP service desks, fountains, gardens, and eventually through another gate back to the regular MGM lobby. That was an experience in itself.  The dining room was lavishly decorated with purple and white chairs and chandeliers.  The service was really good.  We had a Cantonese server that spoke our language who guided us through all the food and gave us tips for choosing the bread, the cheese and the desserts.  He even gave us free fruits to go with the cheese. The reason that I gave it a 4 stars is because while I remember the experience perfectly well.  None of the food really stood out.  While everything we had was great, there was none that was heavenly.  Nevertheless, it's a restaurant that worth a trip to try!",

    "text": "The facts: My finest meal...  ever.  My personality: I'm Chinese, being cheap is in my genes.  Joel Robuchon at the Mansion was an eye-opening experience.  Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that paying $360 per person would ever be worth it (this is the standard price for the degustation menu), but eating here changed my mind (to tell the truth, you really don't have much of a choice at Robuchon.  Penny-pinchers can opt for the \"cheaper\" $225 per person menu, but that's about all you have in terms of choice).  Wifey and I walked in breathing fire.  We told each other that no place on god's green earth could ever be worth the money we were about to flush here.  All we wanted was the experience and a nice story to tell about how we were once young and crazy and blew a chunk o' money at Vegas.  Well, the cheap Chinese part of my persona now hates me.  I am very close to saying that Robuchon may actually be worth it.  Joel Robuchon is probably one of the world's greatest living chefs.  He has more Michelin stars than he knows what to do with, and has been one of the biggest influences in the post-Nouvelle cuisine era.  The man was a living god even before he appeared on Japan's Iron Chef!  Now don't mistake this place for L'atelier Joel Robuchon which is the more casual-themed restaurant nestled right next door at MGM... this place is the Mount Everest of fine dining. So why should you consider dropping a grand on one meal? Well lemme tells ya... Everything here is \"over the top\".  From the selection of 28 kinds of bread from the bread cart, to the impressively gaudy 30ft ceilings and purple themed dining room, and the requisite snooty French waiter.   Every plate was a work of art and the creativity was impressive.  What softened the pain I felt when I signed the outrageous credit card bill was the fact that they did everything possible to make this worth your hard-earned money.  They shaved truffle onto everything, stuffed foie gras into every nook and cranny, and topped whatever they could with caviar.  In fact, I almost believe that they would sprinkle truffles over the guests if they thought it would make your experience better.  I would recommend this place highly!!  ***** UPDATE  11/07***** No, I didn't go back (yet)...  But I feel VINDICATED now that the world-famous Michelin Guide has reviewed Las Vegas and has determined that the ONLY establishment worthy of three stars is.... Joel Robuchon at the Mansion! As of this writing, the Michelin Guide has only reviewed 4 cities in the US: New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.  Only 6 restaurants amongst all of these cities were awarded 3-stars.  Los Angeles was the only city unable to produce a 3-star winner (confirming my suspicion that El Lay is a terrible food city).",

    "text": "In the City of Sin, this place is HEAVEN!  If you know that there's no way of you entering through the pearly gates of afterlife or if you'd just like to experience it now, you MUST go to Joel Robuchon at the Mansion.  True, the price tag is steep.  But, can you really put a price on the culinary apex.  (I use the word apex because it's all downhill from here.)  From one dish to the next Chef Le Tohic just challenges your imagination and palette.  On June 1, 2008, his 16 course tasting menu took us on a mariner's voyage.  On a final note, sixteen courses were tough.  Everything was a dream, it was all so good that I forgot to pace myself.  It nearly put me in a (food) coma, and that's when boyfriend started singing... girlfriend in a coma, i know, i know, it's serious.  (silly)  Thank you Chef Le Tohic and your staff, especially Jan, our amazing table attendant.  You made my birthday a very memorable experience.  ================================== Our menu is as follows:  (Amanda B. took great pictures of the meal that night, see Photos)  0. Bread  - You have to see this.  It's a well presented bread tray, baked fresh daily with nearly twenty varieties.  And, they have them reheated after you choose so they arrive warm. 1. L'AspergeBlanche - White Asparagus \"Panna Cotta\", fresh almonds and lemon grass.  - This was simple, refreshing, and well presented dish. 2. La Tomate - Salad of tomato, olive oil with basil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella cheese.  - This dish came in two parts, but meant to be consumed together.  The gelee looked like a plate of miniature eyes.  And, the staff shuck the gelee after they sit it down that it made me giggle seeing all those moving eyes looking at me.  But, back to the dish itself.  Wow!  The tomato was such a delight and the gelee made it a really fun dish. 3, 4, 5. Le Caviar - thin couscous and Oscetra caviar, smooth cauliflower cream, delicate gelle of green asparagus.  - This trio of caviar from Iran was heaven on earth. 6. L'CEuf - Egg yolk in a baby spinach ravioli with morels.  - When we cracked into to this ravioli, the quail yolk just oozed goodness. 7. La Saint-Jacques - Scallops royal with chive emulsion and buckwheat tuile.  - The tuile made this dish very playful. 8. Les Crustaces - Truffle langoustine raviloli with chopped cabbage, sea urchin, potato puree with hint of coffee and ginger perfumed tea.  - Jan highly recommended the langoustine in this trio.  According to him, it is the best dish he's ever had.  And, I have to say, the langoustine is pretty high up on my list too. 9. Les Petits Pois - Light pea veloute with mint on top of delicate sweet onion custard.  - Good dish, but, at this point, I began to slow down.  Lucky for me, my boyfriend loves a good pea veloute. 10. Le Thon - smoked and seared tuna, cauliflower, nori and green curry.  - Yummy yellowtail. 11. Le Veau - Sautee veal chop with natural jus and vegetable tagliernis flavored with pesto.  - The rosemary on the dish was very powerful to the nose.  But, set that aside, the veal was perfect. 12. Les Pousses de Soja - Soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon zests and coriander.  - The soy bean was presented to me in a way that I never had it before, and it was good. 13. L'Acai - Red fruits franite, fresh raspberry and yogurt sorbet.   - This dish really woke me up.  Very refreshing, very good. 14. Le Caramel - Caramel cremeux infused with Arabica, chocolate rice soufle.   - Oh, men!  Think of a multi-layered dessert where you have to take your spoon and dip it through all the layers, then in one quick swoop, pull it up and take the perfect bite of chocolate goodness.  As a chocoholic, it was very nice! 15. Raspberry Ice Cream Cake  - A full raspberry ice cream cake (that could serve 8 people and there were only two at the table) arrived at our table with a candle and everyone wished me a happy birthday, a very sweet touch.  We had this with our favorite teas, I blache and my boyfriend oolong. 16 - Le Cafe ou le The - escorte de mignardishes - special tasting of varieties sweet desserts.  - I could barely take a bite of the cake, let alone the sweets.  We had a great and the staff was amazing.  Thus, we entrusted Jan to put together a couple boxes of goodies, which was accompanied by two copies of the menu and another full 8\" tall, 8\" round fruit cake.",

I had the 6 course dinner and two of the courses had $60 supplementary charges.  Still adore the bread cart (no restaurant has a better one).  Service was excellent.  Three of my six courses underwhelmed me.  The lobster, uni and fried rice that I swooned over last year had lobster that was somewhat overdone (dry); it was very flavorful though.  The beef that was supposed to be similar to wagyu, although served med-rare was not able to be cut with the butter knife provided.  After too many efforts, I finally asked for a steak knife which didn't help too much since there was too much gristle in the beef.  Shame since what pieces of beef that I could eat had nice flavor.  The pommes puree were their usual perfection!  Loved the egg and caviar in the potato nest.  The veal broth with veal ravioli, champignons and black truffle was very nice.  The cheese course didn't have enough soft cow's milk cheeses (they had plenty last year though).  The dessert was excellent:  meringue sphere with apple sorbet and apple cubes.  While not as magnificent as the Sphere du Sucre from last year, it was lovely.  The bon-bon trolley always delights (although I was getting full).  Love having the gold limo pick me up at the hotel and return me back to the hotel.",

Not only is Joel Robuchon the person with the most amount of Michelin Stars (28 to be exact) but that translates to the plates here at the restaurant with his own name on the door. We wanted some good French food while we were in town and this was the highest rated place. Long story short we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. Heads up it is very expensive, and thats coming from me. But thats what you should expect from a 3 Michelin Star restaurant (Michelin stopped judging Vegas in 2009) but the whole experience was phenomenal from start to end. We ended up choose the option on the menu which was a little less expensive on the menu compared to the tasting menu which was over $400 per person. We got 1 appetizer 1 Entree and some dessert. I went with the Seared Scallops which came with green curry with young leeks for my App and for entree I went with the Ribeye and they bring a dessert Trolly around along with a bread trolly before the main courses. They bake more than 12 different types of bread that were each the best bread I have had, they just melt in your mouth. I also got an Ice Wine from Canada which was very sweet and delicious. Overall I would come back but it would need to be celebrating something to be able to drop that much for one dinner. It's not just food though its an experience and an orchestra.",

Although quite expensive and not for everyone, the 16 course meal was heavenly. I went with the standard option and my wife with the vegetarian, both meals with some overlapping items were delicious and beautifully presented. Service was impeccable.  Some side points include making sure you leave yourself 3-4 hours for the meal. Opting to get some tea with infused herbs was a good choice. The only critique would be that the bread cart did not live up to my expectations but maybe I chose the wrong ones to sample (it seemed that Guy Savoy's was better).",

    "text": "Wow. My only regret is that our reservation was so late that by the end I was too tired (and full) to sample anything from the dessert cart.  This restaurant is super super spendy but if you can splurge it is totally worth every penny. The dishes are unique but not so out there that it's hard for a picky eater to enjoy.  Honestly can't remember all the dishes so I posted our menu. I loved the caviar starter - it was one of my favorites of the night. L'avocat and la daikon were also standouts. I thought the wagyu was ok - I've had better Japanese wagyu at other places. The soft boiled egg dish was a waste of space in my belly - wish it had come at the end so I could have just skipped it. Also could have done without l'aubergine- not a fan of the curry flavor.  My only complaint is that I felt the service lacking a bit for a Michelin star restaurant. Maybe it was just our server but he was very impersonal. Not to the extent of being rude but I definitely prefer more friendly service. We thought we would be hungry after the tasting menu but all the dishes that come out become really filling when there are so many.  So glad I got to experience this restaurant! Highly recommend for a special occasion.",

I had the squid ink paata as my main course. It was a little intimidating since we were the only patrons there. Felt like we were in the library. Service is fine. I liked how they had so many bread choices. However i wished the second time I picked out my bread they would have warmed it up like the first time. Drinks here are very generic unless you like Hennessey, then there are more options. I wish I had more time because I really wanted to try their hen dish. Also got a pound cake for the next day. I ate it 2 days later and it was still moist, but a little too sweet for my taste. Overall, for the 2 course meal, it was just ok. I'd recommend going for the bigger tasting menu option.",

With that said we were looking forward to dining here and unfortunately there was a mixup with the times, at the end we were late, 15-20 minutes to be exact. They informed us they had to release our spot and the would try to seat us, in the meantime they offered us to go to their main restaurant next door to sit in their lounge, no music no atmosphere other than being in detention at the library. When the bartender comes over with what looks like a novel he has no personality, after examining this giant book of wines there's nothing under $50 for a glass, even their house wine. We order a glass and he just dumps it in the glass, no explanation of what it is or flavors or notes to expect. This is $50 a GLASS! So for that we made up our mind that this is a snooty stuck up place that's not worth the 4-$500 it most likely would have cost to have a meal there. So we left! 49 minutes later we receive a phone call from the restaurant wondering if we still wanted our seats! Really? Where was this phone call the first time? So if your into spending way over normal upscale prices and like to hang with the snobs your in luck with this place, otherwise go anywhere else and be treated better",

Call me crazy, but this restaurant is literally worth planning all my important life events around.  Anyways, there is such a huge selection of food on the menu, which constantly changes. Every time I dine at JR, I was able to try different dishes. On my first visit, I opted for the \"Degustation Menu,\" which was basically a huge comprehensive Chef tasting menu. Everything was intricate and delicious. I especially appreciated the crab jelly topped with a thick layer of Ossetra caviar. On my next visits, I chose the 5-course menu, customized to serve any 5 dishes of my choosing (again, hugeeeeeee selection on the ever-changing menu). Another of my favorites was the black truffle langoustine ravioli topped with foie gras reduction (this is orgasm on a plate in the culinary world).  While every single course entertained my palate, the highlight of my meal in all my visits were the beginning and the happy ending - BREAD CART AND DESSERT CART (yes, caps are necessary). There were probably 20+ different types of breads choose from, and of course I chose to try 'em all. All pieces were fresh, warm, and oh so delicate.... best carbs I've ever put in my mouth. And the desserts? Another 50+ pastries, candies, cakes, cookies, macarons, etc to choose from. Again, I insisted on having them all and it was the best decision I've ever made in my life!!!! SO PERFECT.  In short, it is safe to say that Joel Robuchon is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the world and I would come back over and over again...",

Reservation took 60 days. They ask where you'll be staying during your reservation process. Word on the street is that there is a complimentary limo available for pick-up for non-MGM staying patrons.  They'll also ask if you'll be celebrating any event as they'll prepare a special cake for the occasion along with a morning after bun?!?  The precision of this restaurant is world class, from service, food, to presentation.  The 16-course tasting menu is a 3+ hour endeavor that is $435/person before tax, gratuity, and beverages.  Some memorable hits: - The Bread Cart! - The Dessert Cart! - Foie Gras - Lobster - Scallop - Caviar  The meal ended with a take-away goody bag with a book, the menu of the evening, along with marshmallows to enjoy later!  ...definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience! :D",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon perfectly embodies the essence of the ultra-ostentatious city of Las Vegas in all its sinfully delicious glory. The extravagant decor will leave you breathless--as will the bill at the end of the meal.. but let's worry about that later, shall we?   We were guided by the hostess into a gorgeous \"garden\" with a moss wall and beautifully fragrant, vibrant flowers. From our seats, we could see the enormous chandelier in the central dining room. I highly recommend requesting this table because it was absolutely stunning! Pretty sure even the Italian Mafia seated next to us were impressed by the scenery.   We debated between 5-course Menu A ($250) or 16-course degustation ($445), but ultimately decided on Menu A with multiple supplements. Throughout the evening, the birthday boy and I played a game to compare whose dish was better. My choices slightly edged out his, but there's no surprise there. *insert princess emoji*.    For the sake of brevity, I'll just recommend the winning dishes:  Cold Appetizers:  L'Oursin- Sea Urchin with langoustine  Hot Appetizers: La Langoustine- Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with foie gras sauce (AMAZING! Suppl. $35)  Main Courses: Le Spaghetti- Spaghetti with a soft boiled egg, uni, caviar (best dish, hands down; Suppl. $60) La Langouste- Lobster with lemongrass emulsion  Desserts: La Sphere- Lemon shaped-sugar sphere filled with lemon sorbet La Chocolate- Black forest cake (CUTEST. DESSERT. EVER. Picturesque)  The bread cart is spectacular, but that dessert cart is simply DIVINE. Desserts so adorable that even the most apathetic sociopaths would squeal with joy.   Although the total bill came out to a whopping $825 with tax and tip, I'd say the entire experience was worth the hefty price tag.  It's unlikely I'd return because it was almost too rich to enjoy repeatedly, but for someone truly special (such as yourself, duh) there's no better way to celebrate. Nothing says \"I love you\" quite like foie gras, black truffle, and caviar. Except for.. ah, nevermind.   Best girlfriend award or what?",

While most of food was very good (except for the chocolate souffle, which was pretty awful), the experience overall was not what I would expect for the price.    My husband let them know it was my birthday when we made the reservation, and called them again a few days before to remind them, and they did literally nothing to acknowledge it.  I don't expect a free dessert, though that certainly would have been nice, but I frankly find it shocking at a restaurant of this price point that they could not even write \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate, stick a candle in the dessert I ordered, or wish me happy birthday in person.  Apparently they told my husband he could pay $30 for a mango cake for me (which he didn't do because I don't really like mango), and if he didn't do that, they would write a birthday message on whatever dessert I ordered.  It's bad enough they didn't do anything, but it's even worse that they told my husband they would and then didn't follow through.    I know you can't really think of fine dining in terms of value, but this is absurdly expensive by any definition.  The prix fixes are $127 or $169 for just 2 courses (depending on which two) and go up from there. The degustation is $445, way more than the French Laundry.  I don't think its unreasonable to have sky high expectations for these sky high prices.   The famous bread cart was good but not great.  All the bread was tasty but it all tasted pretty similar.  It's nice that they have small portions so you can try tons of kinds without filling up.  Contrary to what others have said, we weren't offered bread throughout the meal.  After the first visit, we asked for more bread once and they brought some, but they never wheeled the cart around again.  The amuse was probably my favorite part of the meal - a strawberry/tomato gazpacho with burrata and pistachios that was both creative and well-executed.  My husband did the appetizer/entree menu and his soft-boiled egg with mushrooms and asparagus appetizer was great.   For our entrees, I had veal that was very good and my husband had the beef, which he loved.  Both entrees came with the famous Robuchon whipped potatoes which look like mashed potatoes but have a very different texture.  They were excellent.    I did the entree/dessert menu, and I broke my \"never pay supplements\" rule and spent an extra $10 for the famous and supposedly fantastic \"bitter chocolate souffle.\"  What a mistake.  It was neither fantastic nor bitter.  It was overly sweet and had almost no chocolate flavor.  It was huge though, so I asked to get it go and was told the chef \"does not do that.\" What??? This is not a buffet.  I had already paid for it and the souffle is going in the trash if I don't eat it.  How unbelievably wasteful (and unhealthy - it encourages overeating).    The mignardise cart is beautiful and has at least 25 things on it, but they weren't great.  The macarons were extremely stale.  We weren't told there's a 5 item limit per person, like some reviews say, but we also didn't ask for one of everything.  We ordered about 6-7 pieces each.  We called to ask for the limo pickup and were told they have discontinued it for the month of May.  Admittedly, this isn't something the restaurant really advertises and I only knew about it from Yelp reviews but it was a big part of why we chose the restaurant and it was too bad that we couldn't have it.  Many restaurants put the bill in front of the man by default, but the sexist attitudes in their service went way beyond that.  They asked just my husband if we wanted wine and took away the wine list after he said HE didn't want wine.  And after I handed them my credit card with MY name on it to pay, the same guy then handed my husband the signature slip and a pen and said \"Monsieur, s'il vous plait...\"   It probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if the service during the rest of the meal had been better, but it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  My husband thinks 2 stars is too harsh because we had a pleasant meal and the food was great until the dessert course, but 3 stars on Yelp is \"a-ok\" and I'm sorry, we paid a ton and weren't satisfied, that's not a-ok.  (Also the dessert course was literally half my meal, so the fact that it sucked was a big factor).  Obviously a lot of Yelpers (and Michelin) disagree, though I do wonder if it's gone downhill recently, because many of the recent reviews seem lukewarm.  The dining room is absolutely beautiful, I'll give them that.",

    "text": "For our 10th wedding anniversary we decided to go all out and dine at Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand. Thanks to the yelp reviews, we knew to book their complimentary gold limo in advance and got one of the three pickup services of the evening. We were taken to the private gated entrance to the MGM mansion with $5000 a night villas (who knew?). Then led through the mansion and high stakes poker tables to the restaurant in the casino.  The meal: You do not have to order the degustation 16 course meal. Trust me on this. Not only do they offer an extensive bread cart with as much as you desire with honestly the best butter we have ever had (see pic) you do not have to order dessert as there is an included sweets cart with whatever you want.   I ordered the lobster ravioli for the appetizer and pork for my entree. Both hands down the best on the menu. The pork was so tender like cutting into a rib eye- the ravioli has been a staple on the menu since day one and you'll see why. My husband  ordered the chilled lobster, seared foie gras and sea bass along with the cheese cart for dessert since he's not a chocolate fan. One of the best meals of our lives and we've been to French Laundry in Yountville twice.   The service: this is where we only gave four out of five stars. The waiters were fantastic but again having seen the synchrony and service at French Laundry it's hard to compare.   Special note: the chef came out to chat a bit during dessert so that was a nice personal touch.   Would definitely return again.",

I ordered the full course menu with my wife. 17 courses in all.   The things that stand out in my mind were the bread selection, the Kobe beef, a perfectly boiled egg, and some really good desserts.  For the price they should throw in a bottle of champagne and a little more spoilage. Out meal was $1500 without a wine pairing. We didn't even get to meet the chef. How do I know Joel was preparing the meals???? I can only hope for the amount I paid.  For that much money they should pamper the hell out of you. The vibe was cold and impersonal. In hindsight it wasn't worth it but at least I didn't loose that money on a roulette table.",

First second and third dish wash just amazing.. impeccable; the next 4-5-6 was horribly rich.. just too much fat one after another... a mistake a chef should not do or whoever is choosing the menu.  The restaurant very small fells like Denny's, there is literally no room in between tables, feels like a fast food. I was expecting for a 3* Michelin restaurant to have an intimate atmosphere. I was unlucky to have a table across that was loud as a concert.  If is not incredibly busy they should really space out the tables.. not put them that close. They could've done that when i was there.  Over all if we talk only about food execution was 10/10 If we talk about how they choose the order of the food or the chef menu in general 4/10 Service 10/10 Ambiance 2/10  I'll put some pictures of some of the amazing food. Hi ven the bad food looked good :)  I spent more than 1400$ for two people, but I won't pat myself. It wasn't worth it.   Improve the seating area (we need way more space in between tables to feel comfortable and not feel like in a Denny's) , balance the chef menu better, ask people not to yell because they disturb other tables. We come here for a luxury experience and an amazing taste. I really didn't hit that note.. unfortunately... again the staff was amazing",

    "text": "Went here again on my most recent trip to Vegas. There are a lot of great places to eat in Vegas, but this is the best. Definitely make reservations.   There are so many great things we had here, but since I've already reviewed it, I'll stick with the highlights.   Bread cart- This thing is insane. They bring out a bread cart with 50 or so different types of bread and rolls. You pick what you want, they warm them up in the over for you, then bring them out. They also have this massive butter sculpture made out of the most baller butter on the planet. Not sure how to describe it, but I've never had butter that good. I could probably go for just the bread and dessert cart.  Langoustine Ravioli with Black Truffle- These were one of the best things I have eaten. Super, super rich, but absolutely decadent.   Dessert cart- like the bread cart above, but for dessert. Make sure you leave room. I think I tried everything and there was not one thing I didn't like.   We went there for my wife's birthday and they made a homemade ice cream cake for her. It was really nice of them and very tasty too. This plus the dessert cart ensured that I needed a wheelbarrow to get me out of there.   The service is probably the best I have experienced anywhere. Good luck getting your water below 3/4 full. There is an army of wait staff, but you never seem to notice them as they are very good about not being overbearing.   I will reiterate that this is the best restaurant in Vegas and probably one of the 5 best restaurants I've been to. There are lots of expensive places to eat, but this one tops them all. Compared to other pricey restaurants, I'd say there's pretty good value here.",

We were seated in about 10 minutes at a nice corner booth ( only the two of us). I ordered their 4 course tasting menu ( 1 cold and 1 hot appetizer, 1 entree and 1 dessert). The waiter told us that it is a very popular selection. I have to agree with it because last time I went to a 3 star Michelin restaurant and ordered a 10 course tasting menu, I was so full halfway through it. I am very happy that they actually give you a choice  to that, which other 3 star restaurants do not.  They also have a great bread selection and let you pick from their bread cart, as well as a petit four selection cart to choose your sweets.  The food is excellent to say the least. I ordered the lobster with truffled sauce as my cold appetizer, truffled ravioli with foie gras as hot appetizer ,Iberia pork from Spain as my main entree and a chocolate mousse for desserts. To top it off, the waiter came with a whole birthday cake for my birthday! They also gave me a lemon cake to take home. I think this is given to all the ladies too. Very enjoyable experience! Although I must caution about the price of champagne if you were to order one. I had a glass of rose champagne and it caused $48 a glass. Still totally worth it for the experience!",

We came this time on a comp from a casino host who told us the dress code was business casual, we walked in and was clearly profiled by the hostess and told we were not allowed in because they require formal attire, when I mentioned the other clearly not formal group dining last time I was told \"well sometimes we relax the dress policy on slow days\"  This was clearly a case of being profiled by a person who should not work at a place like this, all the fine dining places I have been to have all revolved around the best service and finding solutions to issues not just turning up a nose and getting rid of people you think do not belong.

This was my first time and he was taking me out for a treat. Everything in this place is so delicately placed. I loved the array of jewels on the table, it's a very nice touch. I ordered a very nice glass of cabernet and they also brought out a delicious amuse-bouche. Some kind of cute quinoa ball. It was actually really good, almost too cute to eat. The bread cart is out of this world. There were two kinds with cheese so of course I had to try those, plus my boss recommended the milk one.... That one practical melts in your mouth. I think our waiter knew it was my first time and that I barely got to eat any of the extremely fresh butter so he recommended that I try some crusty bread... And I tried to say no, but I'm so glad I accepted. It was so good.   Then they brought out some kind of caviar served on top of something with a cauliflower puree. Next they brought out my appetizer of truffled langoustine ravioli in a foie gras sauce with simmered green cabbage... And it was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend. I had never heard of langoustine before, but Abel said it was like a cross between lobster and  shrimp. He's right that was exactly how it tasted. It was so good.  The staff was incredibly effective and helpful to ensure that no allergy or intolerance was missed. They take great care in paying attention to detail. My main course was the ribeye and it was obviously very good but they brought out these mashed potatoes and oh my goodness... Best mashed potato puree EVER.  Then the dessert cart... It's scary because everything is so tiny and adorable that you don't realize how much you are eating! This is definitely one of the best meals that I've ever eaten.",

Each dish is a presented beautifully and service is exceptional  No doubt the dishes are beautiful and delicious, but I think it's bit overpriced (probably just because it's in Las Vegas) for a once 3 star Michelin. The full tasting menu is too much... we ended up being very full at the last couple dishes. It definitely affected the experience.",

    "text": "Named chef of the century, every one of his flag ship restaurants in Michelin guide cities having three stars and his lesser L'Ateleir at least one.  Award after award and all well deserved.  I've covered the exquisite food in earlier reviews. I will use the majority of this review space to answer the most frequently asked questions I've received and those with no published answers.  First, the mandatory review update:  A meal here is an experience in dining pleasure.  Exquisite food, outstanding service, beautiful wine pairings, incredible dining space, everything comes together to create memories that will last a lifetime. Make no mistake, this is one of the best dining experiences in the world.    The food combines classic French techniques with molecular gastronomy. Ingredients are top notch and have a major impact on the finished product. The butter, hand churned, imported from France has a very unique, almost citrusy flavor to it.    Extremely smooth, rich, and creamy, but not oily or cloying.  Its flavor apparent in the signature mashed potatoes (50% potato, 50% butter).    A standout signature dish, a simple French hen (for two), it's beautiful poultry flavor enhanced by a lobe of foie roasted with it and served together.  The resulting jus heavenly.  Its mineral, livery notes bringing out sweetness and complexity in the moist hen.  The melting fat, richness.  Service is impeccable delivered by professionals who have made service and fine dining a career (ie running the dining room at the Tokyo location for years before coming to Vegas). Extremely personable and friendly if you allow them to be.  FAQs  - Are reservations required?  Yes.  Weekend and holiday reservations require a minimum two month advance reservation. This applies to platinum and noir Mlife members as well as guests of executive properties, Aria SkySuites and MGM SkyLofts. (Even my host couldn't alter my reservation to a later time). Email or phone confirmation required 24 hours in advance of your reservation.  - is there an ala carte menu? No. Select one of five menu options, Priced according to the number of starters and entrees (i.e., one starter, one entree $127; Choice of two starters, two entree, one dessert $250). The full degustation menu, 16 courses, is $495.  All menus include an amuse, anything from the bread cart, and anything from the petite fours cart.  They are supplemental charges for many of the dishes.  Simply add that to the price of your menu. Tax and service not included.  - are portions scaled based on the number of courses ordered? No except for the degustation menu.    - does every person at the table need to order the same number of courses?  Aside from the degustation menu, no but it is HIGHLY recommended.  You don't want to see someone sitting at your table not eating anything while you enjoy your course right?  - do they offer wine pairings? Yes and no. There are pairings for the degustation menu from $300-$1000.  For all other menus, custom by the glass or better yet by the bottle pairings can be created.  Use the som.  He is extremely well versed in their excellent cellar.  Very heavy emphasis on French wines, all properly cellared and ready to be drunk. The average bottle price is $550.  - do they pressure guest to order expensive wines? No. Be sure to let the som know what you want to spend.  Don't be afraid to admit you are not very familiar with a varietal, French wines, etc.  He does an incredible job sharing his passion and enthusiasm with you.  - what exactly is the dress code? Casual elegant. An evening dress is appropriate for the ladies, suits for men. At very least, jackets are required.  No denim, no athletic wear, no sneakers,  - How long will dinner be?  Allow at least 3 to 5 hours. My recent visit, two starters one entree and one dessert, 4.5 hours.  - What is the real price of dinner?  Dinner for three including two starters, one entree, one dessert each, two bottles of average priced wine, a round of vintage champagne by the glass and a couple of  pours of vintage  Madera, tax and gratuity; $2,800.  Definitely a celebratory indulgence but well worth it.",

My highlight was the mashed potatoes oddly enough as I don't think I will ever eat better mashed potatoes! Great staff and so much detail in everything they do.",

You won't find a better restaurant in Las Vegas. There is a reason why he earned the coveted 3 Michelin Star Award for this restaurant. Going here was one of the best experiences of my life! If you want a night to remember... This is the place to go! If I ever go back to Las Vegas, I will definitely come back!  The presentation is like artwork. Everything is beautiful. Interesting and creative flavors. The staff is wonderful and helpful. Great wine. A True dining experience. variety and how well it was all prepared. Everything looked like art and tasted even better. Best bread you will ever eat too. Deserts are amazing and you get to choose as much as you like from the desert trolley.  I hope i can go back soon;)",

    "text": "Guest post by Cathey using Rob's account ;)  Overall 4.5 but we will round up due to the amazing service!  We came here last night to celebrate my 30th Birthday as it has been on my list to try for years but I was waiting for a special occasion and this seemed like the perfect one.  I was debating between a few options and finally settled on coming here due to Bailey Z's detailed and helpful review as the tasting menu seemed like way too much food / overwhelming so it was nice to know about the other 4 and 5 course options they offered.  I opted for the \"4 course\" $198 menu with 2 apps, 1 main, 1 dessert while the bf opted for the \"5 course\" $250 menu with 2 apps, 2 mains, and 1 dessert. Both came with the amuse-bouche and \"seductive sweets\" aka the decadent unlimited dessert cart which was pretty much like an extra course.  I choose the pescetarian friendly seafood options: 1) Le King Crab and Le Homard cold appetizers 2) Le Homard du Maine main course ($35 supplement) 3) La Mangue (dessert)  The bf choose: 1) La Chataigne and L'Oeuf de Poule Miroir hot appetizers 2) Le black cod and Le Boeuf main courses 3) La parfum de iles dessert  Since it was my birthday, they gave us a special cake in addition to the above AND gave us a complimentary extra entree (the seabass) AND 2 non-alcoholic mocktail drinks! Not sure if that is typical, because of the birthday, or if they were just feeling extra generous that night but it was definitely appreciated!  All of the food was delicious, definitely high quality with great flavor and presentation. The one thing I wasn't a big fan of was the sauce for the lobster main entree but the manager inquired about our feedback after the main course so I had mentioned this and when the bill came, he actually took the supplenental charge off which was an extremely unexpected but much appreciated surprise. This attention to detail, exceptional service, and commitment to excellence is truly what sets a place like this apart and makes it worth every penny!  Our waters were never empty and we must have been offered (and accepted) a solid 3 or 4 rounds from the delicious and famous bread cart. They were just attentive enough without going overboard. To top it off, they sent us home with sound pound cake in a nice gift bag!  Definitely recommend trying this place for your next celebration or special occasion!",

Most of those famous chefs' restaurants in Vegas aren't as good as the real thing, unlike Joel Robuchon.   We came here at nearly 10PM on a Saturday. Everyone decided to go with the first choice of their set menus: two appetizers; two mains; and a dessert. Before starting our meal, we were presented a bread cart, all the bread we picked out were brought to the back to be warmed up. They were all really good, especially with their special sea salt butter. The best appetizer of the night were the smoked salmon with caviar on top, and lobster ravioli with truffle on top. My favorite main was the ribeye, followed by the suckling pig prepared four ways. The desserts were so so.   Then a \"carnival\" dessert cart was brought out for the complimentary sweets, it was cute and pretty, good to look at. But by then I had no room for anymore food.  All the waiters were friendly and very professional. After living in LA for awhile I really have missed that kinda of professional service. Joel Robuchon is now my favorite western restaurant in Vegas.",

My wife and I decided for a special occasion to go BIG before we went home. We picked the highest level tasting menu and were ready to be impressed.   Sadly that did not happen.   There were some dishes that stood out and earned the stars on the wall..then there were some that fell flat. For $400+ each, I did not expect a fall.  If you go, the pick your own is the best choice as you can be specific on what sounds good and hopefully they meet your expectation.   Sadly we will not be back as there are way to many great options in the area.",

The desserts was great but we were overloaded on sweets when they brought out this cartful of treats.  After the treats they brought out a cake!!  Too much sweets already that when they brought out a cake I was already having a sugar rush I couldn't eat it.  They gave me a pound cake as a gift to take home (this is their theme to get boyfriends/husbands to take their love ones for a birthday dinner).   Don't waste your money here and take her to the one in Paris if you want an amazing experience.  I had the best experience at his restaurant in Paris filled with elegance, art, and amazing cuisine.  I find that most good restaurants that opens in Vegas is mostly theme and not the same dining experience.",

Those are quite the accomplishments....   The food was absolutely wonderful. We ordered the Degustation menu, which consisted of 17 courses.. everything tasted so good and it had so much variety of tastes and textures. It was amazing on every level. The food was also beautifully presented. It is definitely an experience for your senses.  The service is highest of the top class of all star servers. They were operating at exceptional heights. Answered every question and met every single expectation... they never disappoint.   Make sure to make your reservation ahead of time.... the list can take quite long. It's not often you get to dine at a 3 Star Michelin's restaurant... and if it is often for you, then keep living your best life!  This dinner is a perfect one-of-a-kind experience. The decor is absolutely stunning. The type of stuff that is perfect for the gram and to snap. It's such an amazing experience! Definitely not inexpensive, but it's hands down worth every single cent!",

    "text": "So this place is definitely more of an experience than it is filling. So eat beforehand lol. I am vegan and gluten free and I'm pretty sure everything i was given had this criteria. I actually do wish there could've been more food on the plate and more vegan and gluten free options because everything i had was really good. The bread was either vegan or gluten free, not both. And they have like 12 different kinds. The desert tray, i feel like could also have more vegan options. Some of the chocolate wasn't great. Although, the small vegan jelly desert thing was actually good. The atmosphere was amazing though and i felt like they wanted to make sure we were comfortable with our food and everything. So the 4 stars is just because i wanted more food and options because of my allergens. Hopefully they add more to their menu.",

    "text": "Ouch. Not for me. Plates are fixed price and ranged from $125 to $265 and if you want the complete 16 course meal it is $425. All of these prices are per person. Wow, who pays this price?  I love great restaurants but $950 for dinner for two? There has to be some value right?   The food was good but not outrageous and very small portions. The desert was excellent but again very small. Both the bread cart and the desert cart were cool.   Now lets talk service- stuffy, short, no excitement, no personality. How about the atmosphere? If you like a restaurant experience where everyone is eating in grandmas living room and no one wants to say a word without being scolded, this is your place. Too quiet for me.  I would never go back to this place and would cringe if I had to return as a guest on a business trip.",

    "text": "Service was Excellent! Food was good. Atmosphere Divine! Complimentary limo rides to and from the house was a wonderful bonus.  They even send you home with a parting gift.  And the Mansion was a once in a lifetime magnificent sight!  Had the 16 Course Degustation menu and ordered a nice Rose from Cortes De Provence.  With an initial glass of Champagne when we arrived + 2 Bottles of flat water = just a little over $1000 for 2, before tip.   Although I felt the dinner was impressive, I would suggest several things.  1. 16 Courses was WAYYYYYYYYYYY too much food.   Yes, the portions are small but they are extremely rich and heavy.  The table next to us chose to pair their meals w/ wine and they were dying by the 4th course!  Next time I'll just do 3-4 courses. You want to enjoy the most expensive meal of your life and not have to fight through it!   2. When you get seated they will ask if you would like a cocktail or glass of Champs. Take your time and request a wine and champagne menu and order water for the moment. I then would suggest ordering a bottle of wine or champagne for the entire night because by the glass is almost the same price as one bottle. Choose your alcohol wisely and you can easily shave $200-300 off your bill. My single glass of champagne cost almost as much as our bottle of wine.   3. Go easy on the bread cart.  Though it is impressive and has some wonderful options, it can easily creep up on you later while you struggle to finish the rest of your meals. It shows up first so exercise restraint and just choose a few.   I really did enjoy the experience at Joel Robuchon.  The Michelin Star restaurant really lives up to that promise of excellent service and an ultra plush dining experience.  I did feel that the food was good and some very delicious but not EXTRAORDINARY.  The price is a little too steep for the food but I think the value lies more in the limo pick up, sneak peak of the Mansion, impeccable service and sensational ambiance. I would suggest dining on the faux terrace with the gorgeous floors of flowers and the beautiful IVY WALL. It was extremely romantic and cozy. Perfect for celebrating something special like we did for our Anniversary.",

    "text": "No doubt a great restaurant, but with the challenge of facing high expectations.Some plates were incredible but felt the service was a little off.   Not what you expect from a restaurant this caliber, as they compensate by making stiff instead of amicable. Specifically serving time was a beat off, and felt that affected the rhythm and marginally the temperatures of some plates but that did't prevent us from having a great dinner. We had the four course menu. It's hard to select since everything is deliciously described and beautifully presented. The Foie had a nice composition, and I enjoyed the truffled langoustine ravioli, although expected a different flavor profile. The cod was perfectly cooked. I specially remember the desserts, the sugar sphere (La sphere)  and the black forest. A lot of small details make the difference: form the bread to the lemon cake. We're on a quest to collect 100 Michelin Stars and this was a great addition to our collection (don't know if worth the 3 stars). A restaurant for a special occasion that needs to be reviewed in a different category. At the end, we think the whole dinning experience: the value, on how it made us feel and the plates worth remembering.",

    "text": "Really disappointing experience for a 3 Michelin star restaurant.  A strong start with well-crafted cocktails ($22 each) and an excellent bread service including hand-cut butter and delicious olive oil - amazing!  My sea urchin appetizer s absolutely gorgeous and delicious...now the shortcomings...   My husband has a gluten-sensitivity, so he was prepared for a very limited selection.  The waiter informed him that they could easily modify his main course selection and replace the ravioli garnish with the mushroom filling.  According to the waiter, nearly every selection on the menu can be modified to be gluten-free.  When our entrees arrived (not delivered by our waiter) we were surprises to see a ravioli (looks like a pot-sticker) on my husband's plate (the ravioli had not touched anything else on the plate, so he just moved it to mine).  Our waiter came by and apologized.  I had the turbot and it was overcooked (a bit rubbery), but had a delicious sauce which helped with the dryness of the fish.  Another waiter came by and made a show of serving us each some of the signature mashed potatoes.  Sadly, the mashed potatoes had a gluey texture (probably overwhipped).  I only had one bite since they were not good.  Was no one tasting the food coming out of the kitchen?  When the plates were cleared no one asked about the pile of potatoes left on my plate.  At this point, even though the meal had some low points we were remarking that the seasoning of the dishes was excellent.  Then, to make up for the ravioli, our waiter served us a complimentary course of creamed brocoli and some other crunch veggie pieces.  My husband was starving, so he ate it.  It was far too salty for me to eat.  When the plates were cleared, I was not asked about the untouched dish.  I told the server that the dish was too salty.  Then our waiter told us to select a dessert (we had not ordered a dessert course), we were a bit surprised/confused (it was complimentary).  We decided to share the chocolate souffle. We each were given a choice of ice cream (yummy!) that was scooped out of gallon size silver canisters.  Finally, the mignardises arrived and they were each lovely and tasty.  We did not order the cheese course, but the tables on either side did.  The waiter was very knowledgable and patient and the cheese were fragrant (pungent!).  We also ordered a bottle of wine.  We had noticed a bottle of Tannat on the list that was only $40 and we asked about it.  The sommelier told us that it was \"rustic\" and suggested some alternatives similar to Tannat at various price points (no other Tannats were in stock).  We were surprised that he had bothered to include a Tannat on the list that he did not want to serve - just remove it!  Overall I would recommend this restaurant as an almost 2 michelin star.  Other 2 and 3 michelin star restaurants we have dined at did not make mistakes.  There were just too many mistakes at Joel Robuchon, in particular the lack of tasting what was leaving the kitchen by the chef in charge the night we were there.  It is very expensive, so we appreciated the effort to make up for the gluten mistake with the yucky complimentary veggie course and then the good dessert course.",

    "text": "Nothing here actually WOW'd me. Nothing I ate really made me think 'I HAVE to have this again'.  This was like eating in a library. Everyone was quite, they/we were afraid to talk because it was so pretentious. The classical music featured such hits as: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWod-MudLNPA%26feature%3Drelated&s=36ff3d1e63d77343b5a32fd8fe091c8878228b9aa41b9127ecb8e9d4148274a1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Wod-...</a> Listen to this song and you can imagine the setting.  I was seated on a purple velvet couch with pillows. After fidgeting with the pillows to prop myself up right at the table, well I noticed a foot stool, \"odd for such a fancy place\" I thought, but I had walked quite a way in 4 inch heels, so I used it.  I later found out this apparently is for you purse. (awkward)  First of all, the waiters seemed to hang on your every word, which was annoying. If I want to talk to my date, well i don't need anyone chiming in. I asked my date 'what do you think this means'? Referring to something on the menu, out of no where pops a waiter who answered just as he is about to answer. That's what i mean. The whole meal we had to whisper, we finally started texting each other. That's pretty bad.  If I smiled the head waiter would come over and ask if I needed something. I would say 'no I'm fine'. Pretty soon I just kept smiling to drive him crazy, it worked. He kept stopping at every pass. He probably now thinks I had the hots for him.  QUICK TIP: For those of you too embarrassed to ask: If you see a menu item that says (supp $40) after it, that means on top of the menu price they add $40 dollars to it for whatever reason, like the truffle cheese souffle. They said it was because of the amount and price of truffles used. The lamb, well I guess it was a baby lamb fed gold flakes and the milk of the gods .  Anyway on to the food:  The amuse bouche (aka \"gift from the chef\") was a tin on a plaque. It looked like a tin of caviar, but it had something creamy under it. It was interesting. I ate it to be polite, but it was nothing special. In fact it was rather flavorless and the texture was off putting. It looked pretty.  Everything was plated beautifully. The crab salad was my favorite menu item and my second course. It was excellent and almost too pretty too eat. The flavors and texture combined were amazing.  My dates cheese souffle was too rich for me. The date ate it and was \"not impressed\".  The expensive truffles really did not seem to add anything to the dish other than a presentation factor.  The main course I picked was lobster. It was beautiful, but a little tough. I expected it to melt like butter in my mouth. It didn't, in fact it was hard to cut. The flavor was ok, nothing special.  I tried my dates lamb, it was very good, it tasted like any other lamb I have had at a restaurant, which made me wonder again why the upgrade in cost.  The best part about the meal to me, was the bread cart. OH My God! It was pure heaven! They really need to open up a bakery for these clouds from heaven. They had the flakiest, butteriest, most flavorful, wonderful assortment of goodies, well i almost filled up on bread.   You can have as many \"cart items\" from any cart, as your heart desires, don't be afraid to say \"one of everything\" when a cart comes strolling by. After 2 trips of the cart i pretty much did. There was garlic rosemary twists, brioche, cheese breads, croissants, crostini, baguettes, almost every type of bread imaginable and the absolute BEST!  The $20 martini or specialty drinks were delicious, worth $20 a pop? Not really. I did not taste or feel any alcohol. I think we should have gone for a nice bottle of wine.  Our actual desserts that came with the menu, they were odd. A strange menagerie of ingredients that I still am not sure if they went together well. I did not finish mine.  The dessert cart was pretty, none of the candies/treats were anything special. Coffee and water are extra$.  After the meal here ( $680 for 2), I wondered if rich people eat like this all the time, and if so, well I am glad I am not that rich or stuffy. I am, however, a food connoisseur. Someone who has always dreamed of eating at a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, someone who would really appreciate the whole experience. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was truly happy for the experience.  Note: I talk about price a lot, but in actuality, $$ is no object for me. So it is more FYI for middle income, average diners visiting for special occasions.",

    "text": "Birthday Celebration = Dinner at Joel Robuchon!!!   From the Complimentary Limo ride to the spectacular service and elegant food's...our night at the mansion was superb! The walk through the mansion to the front of the restuarant felt so long and maze-like but wewe finally made it there!  We were seated in the main dining area in one of the corner booths, which was a fabulous seat. Throughout the 3.5 hours that we were there we probably saw more servers than diner's, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. They just seemed so well-organized and everyone seemed on point.  We started the evening with a bottle of wine, and I was pretty surprised to see bottles under $100! I enjoyed the 4-course meal and the bday boy got the 6-course meal. I don't want to go through every course because we each got different items and just tried each others. I do, however, want to highlight some of the better items we enjoyed:   Bread Cart: felt great to indulge in some carb-loaded goodness.   Appetizer: my Foie Gras was amazing and the plating was spectacular. My hubby's carpaccio easily takes the cake for one of the best presentations I've ever seen...it was so colorfully done!   Main: my farm roasted chicken was tender and so very delicious.   Dessert: I enjoyed the \"Happy Birthday\" cake they brought out to us more than my own dessert...it was extremely good.   I found the bread cart, cheese cart, and mignardises cart to be a bit overwhelming. Even though they take the time to go through each item with you it is still a little hard to follow. The key is to just remember the ones with the key ingredients that you like(which he will point out)....for me it was: milk, raisin, coconut, peanut butter for example. He put together a nice sampling of cheeses for us to try since we weren't too picky on it.   Our meal here made for a very memorable night and if you get the opportunity to come here I'm sure it will do the same for you!",

    "text": "We tried the $180 menu, which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, entree, and dessert.  The amazing bread cart and petit fours cart is also included.  I started with the scallop carpaccio, pea soup, duck and foie gras entree, and the chocolate sherbet for dessert.  In a word, it was ethereal.  The presentation of each dish is a work of art.  It seemed as if every miniscule flower on the scallop carpaccio was intricately placed, and every drizzle was deliberate.  The service is terrific and not stuffy.  The dining room is plush and very quiet but comfortable.  The bread cart and petit four cart were definitely highlights of the experience.  Both are mind-blowingly beautiful and the selections are vast.  Kudos to the waiter for being able to rattle off the long list of breads and chocolates. Robuchon offers a very special and unique dining experience.",

    "text": "We thought we'd strike it big at Blackjack so we decided to dine at Joel Robuchon on 10/18 to continue our dining tour of Michelin star establishments. We thought the decor of this place was absolutely over the top ornate and fantastical. The lounge is very seductive and elegant with the deep red wall color and shiny black marble table tops. The interior of the restaurant has incredibly high ceilings and grandiose decor of flowers, purple draperies, delicate vases and statues and grand chairs. We decided not to overindulgence and didn't opt for the $445 full 16 course tasting menu. Instead we selected one of the smaller tasting menu options of a combination of two appetizers, two mains and two desserts. We tried the salmon tartare, langoustine foie gras ravioli, French hen and foie gras for two, the chocolate cherry Black Forest and chocolate gianduja souffle. Everything was exquisite. We started with the amuse bouche of a cauliflower puree panna cotta. Notable was the chocolate souffle which was so lightly fluffy yet rich. The sauce accompanying the ravioli was very tasty but portioned a little small. The osetra caviar and salmon tartare was so fresh and savory at the same time. The bread cart and dessert cart need no words. Simply divine^2. The only complaint we have is that the pacing of the courses truly emulated the European style and was a little too slow for us.",

My wife and I had been wanting to try a michelin 3 star restuarant for quite some time and we finally got to! We got there for the 2eme service. I got the la truffe (Black truffle tart with confit onions and smoked bacon) and my wife got the les cuisses de grenouille (frog leg fritters with garlic puree and parsley). Both of our portions were small but thats expected when you come to a restaurant of this caliber. We both loved our dishes and I even tried one of the frog legs and was surprised by how tasty they were. We both got the Le Chocolat and it was delish. This was the best meal I have ever had and if the price wasnt so steep I would come back more often. I recommend!",

However my expectation and what I received were 2 different things. The amuse Bouche was delicious, however everything else was average. I ordered the butter fish which came with whipped potatoes. Neither were extraordinary, Roy's butterfish is much better. The bread cart is amazing, probably the highlight of the meal. I also had the lettuce soup, it was good, a novelty but not worth the additional $30+ on the bill. The petit desserts were tasty....nothing life changing or superior to a good bakery.....the chocolate we received was delicious......however I can not justify the price.....I've had Michelin rated restraunts before. This just did not meet or surpass my expectations.",

With one bottle of wine ($140) the total price came to almost $900 with tax. For that price I would expect stellar service, clean bathrooms and jaw-dropping food. I actually had to flush the toilet twice and get rid of the paper on the seat before I would touch the toilet. In a $900 restaurant???? No way. And the wait staff started to clean the restaurant while we were still eating our entree. Very low-class move...our reservation was at 9:00pm which is main dining time in Las Vegas. It's not like we were dining at 2:00am. And, for $900 we had to ask for more water (which, by the way, was $10/liter - no tap water available). Now, for the sake of clarity, we are not cheap people. We've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world including the French Laundry near Napa but this was VERY disappointing. If I could, I would make Mr. Roubuchon sit through his own meal to live this same experience.",

She got the veal while I got something with veggies. We received this tomato gazpacho that released steam which was a cool effect, complimentary, I supppose.  I absolutely enjoyed the bread cart (make sure to stuff yourself if you are only getting the two course meal because they are to die for, I loved the oregano bread!) when I told them it was my moms birthday they brought a beautiful tray of desserts as well as access to the wonderful dessert cart.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal  as did my mom.  But I was shocked that the bill charged not only 7 dollars for a glass of soda, they charged for each glass we drank which was 7 between the two of us ( most of them were mine because I was so thirsty because the glasses were tiny!). I wanted to say something about it, but I didn't want to discuss it in front of my mom because show would have balked at the price. Be prepared for a lovely dinner that will charge you for every penny they can!  I would go again but will not order a soda.",

    "text": "We ate here in the summer of 2008, and the experience left us cold, both figuratively and literally. We were so excited to eat here after trying (and loving) L'Atelier...Joel Robuchon is the \"Chef of the Century\" afterall. Ultimately, however, we could not overlook the poor, dismissive service despite pretty good food. Yes, it was pretty good, but not memorable. We were seated in a little room off the main \"house\"...I think it was supposed to be a \"veranda\" off the Mansion. Whatever it was supposed to be, it was dark and chilly (think Siberia). I'm not sure what we did to be exiled there, as we were dressed very well (I kept my shorts and sandals in the hotel room!), but here we indeed languished with some other unlucky souls. Our server begrudgingly came to take our order, and perhaps we lived down to her expectations when my wife \"only\" ordered the six course dinner (for about $200) despite my going for the whole enchilada, the Grand Degustation menu (12 courses at that time for about $300). I think we were further tagged with the scarlet \"C\" (for cheap) when we only ordered bottled water and a glass of wine each. The waitress then disappeared, only to bestow a few intermittent visits to us the rest of the evening. We thought that she might have just been in a foul mood, but then we saw her obsequiously chattering about and hobnobbing with some apparently higher-rollers in the next room. Oh well.  The bread service was quite amazing...a bread cart loaded with all sorts of classic French baguettes, batards, etc. turned out to be a life-saver because even though I was to \"experience\" 12 courses, I was still left hungry. Suffice to say I got to know the bread guy pretty well that evening. 5 of the 12 courses were vegetable courses (!), and the final 2 were desserts. They were OK, but definitely not worth paying $300 for. Oddly, my menu did not even include a lobster course while my wife's did. The standout of the evening was the Sauteed veal chop with natural herbs gel and vegetable mille-feuille. This was beautiful and refined...just delectable. In direct contrast was the Soybeans cooked risotto style with mushrooms and chives...the soybeans arrived underdone and unpleasantly firm.   The desserts were not memorable...what was memorable was the perfunctory manner in which we were hurried on our way (with a pat on the head and a kick in the ass). Wow, just thinking about this makes me boil! Damage was about $700 for the two of us. Never again...never again.",

For the most part the staff was very friendly but there were a few staff members who were on the stuffy/uptight side.  As expected, service was exceptional from the limo ride to the end of dinner.  Food was excellent with mix of traditional french dishes and french \"fusion\".  Had the 4 course dinner with appetizer, soup, main entree, and dessert.  None of the courses made me stop and say this was the best thing I ever ate, but all courses were exceptional.  As mentioned numerous times in these reviews, the bread and chocolate carts are not from this world.  To be honest, they kind of stole the show from the other dishes.  Just wish they had a written list of all the items on the carts because the choices are overhwelming.  Is it the best restaurant ever?  I still like Allinea in my hometown of chicago more but Joel Robuchon is just a shade below",

The serving portions were small, but since its a multiple course meal, you'll eventually get full. This place has an intimidating appeal, especially to those people who are not much into fine dining. Servers were well trained, very attentive, they make sure your whole dining experience is excellent.  The place exudes class, love the violet velvet seats, the curtain and all the works. This is the place where you actually have to dress formal to dine. Very fancy, its almost impractical  but it was an amazing experience. I didn't know how to order. Eh...

    "text": "Finally sat down for a meal at Joel Robuchon. I was so excited! For the most part I am a vegetarian but occasionally will eat fish and shell fish. I was pleasantly  surprised to find a 16 course vegetarian tasting but decided against it for two reasons: (1) It is priced at $385 without a wine pairing (2) the 16 courses looked a little daunting. I had a tasting/wine paring at Bear Foot Bistro  many years ago and I remember feeling really sick the next day from all the over eating so I was a little concerned about the size of the portions. Granted, if it had included a wine paring I probably would have ordered it.   Highlights have to be * The bread cart: Oh my. Olive Bread or Bread with any kind of cheese are a huge weakness of mine and I caved immediately. Comes with both butter sprinkled with sea salt and olive oil. After you pick your bread they warm it up for you. *The dessert cart: Our waiter kept filling up my plate with delightful little bits of chocolate *Everything in the middle was sort of a blurr, the drinks, the food, oh my *My Manhattan cocktail was prepared exactly as I had asked. A rarity.  *Love the pistachio pound cake parting gift  Cons: * I wore a brand new Burberry dress, nice jewelry and a coat so I am pretty sure I \"passed\" the dress code, but my husband wore a Tommy Bahama shirt so we were sent to the outside/inside court. Even two parties of 1 were seated inside (not that there is anything wrong with that) It was pretty funny to see two more under dressed couples seated near us. It was pretty clear who was \"in\" and who was \"out\".  In the end we decided that was fine because some of the tables inside are close together. I did take a quick look around on the way to the bathroom .. which leads me to .. * One bathroom stall for the woman? * Limo? We were not offered a limo .... hmmm. I would have loved to have seen the mansion which I had previously found out was only accessible to high rollers. The walk from the MGM parking structure to the restaurant was quite an ordeal (for the record we could have valeted but the strip traffic was a nightmare). * So tense! My husband and I love to eat at all kinds of restaurants including very fancy ones, but we also like to have a good time. I accidentally grabbed the wrong knife to butter my bread and I felt like I had committed a federal offense. We finally got our waiter to crack a smile when I said \"let it ride\"  on our drink orders. I just don't understand why good food has to mean everything has to be so serious.  *No black napkins for dark colored clothing?  I'd love to starve myself all day and go back to try the 16 course vegetarian meal, but I am afraid my husband won't want to come with me. Perhaps it will be girls night out dinner. Maybe next time we'll have the limo and get to eat inside :-)",

The food and service are an art form at this oasis inside the MGM.  The purple velvet couches and small intimate atmosphere are the backdrop to a meal you will never forget.  I am a veggie and not a total foodie- so complicated food for the sake of being complicated does not impress me.  This restaurant was amazing from start to finish.  The bread cart had no less then 15 options!  If you get the 15 course it comes with a cheese cart that would make the cowgirl creamery ladies pass out!  Each course is thoughtful and creative.  The theme of the night was truffles and I could not have been happier.  Save your pennies- this place is about $400 a person with drinks and all.  An anniversary?  Birthday?  Make the trip.",

We sat in their atrium which had a wall covered in beautiful green flowers and were nice and secluded; we felt like we could be a little louder here than in the somber, yet gorgeous dining room. The wait staff was phenomenal and they seemed to adapt their personalities to their customers - they could tell that we wanted to be a little bit more laid back than the atmosphere so they brought it down a notch for us. The food was nothing if not spectacularly presented and everything was very flavorful. One of my favorites was a tomato and mozzarella salad - now that would sound simple if you were dining at any other restaurant, but here it was quite a masterpiece. I also enjoyed the Pea soup, the turbot and the lamb. (I normally don't eat quite so many dishes, but all of the menu choices were Prix fix.) My favorite things about the restaurant are the cheese and pastry carts - the things that add ceremony to the evening and that make a dinner at this restaurant an experience rather than a meal. I guess my only complaint is that the dinner was so well orchestrated it seemed as if some of the soul was missing.",

The appetizer was a gorgeous seafood dish, the pea soup was so fresh and yummy, his signature lagostine entree was sublime and the desert, a raspberry cake wrapped in mascarpone cheese over raspberry sorbet and decorated with raspberry chocolate was perfect withe the French Press coffee, then followed by the desert cart which was literally 50 different individual size cakes and confections. We paired the whole meal with a 1/2 bottle of wine the sommelier chose for us and walked away with a full-size loaf of his glazed fruit cake (heaven the next morning with coffee, and for dessert later that night with vanilla ice cream). The meal came to $500 for two, but if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion or just enjoy a really decadent, special meal do not miss Joel Robuchon!",

    "text": "A few friends and I were up in Vegas back in June 2008 and we decided that we wanted to splurge on a nice dinner and it didn't take long for us to all agree on Joel Robuchon at The Mansion.  Once you're inside the restaurant, you feel world's away from the casinos, even though the restaurant is technically in the MGM casino.  The restaurant is very nice and sophisticated inside.  They sat us in a darkly lit bar room, decorated in black and red velvet, while we waited for our table.  Contrasting that, the dining area was brightly lit with a beach-like theme as the table was decorated with a sea blue with seashells.  Very nice decor all throughout the restaurant.  They started off by pushing in a bread cart.  This wasn't just any cart of bread, it was the most impressive assortment of breads I had ever encountered.  The bread twist with bacon was absolutely delicious!  So I should mention that we opted for the $250 6-course menu (for $75 more, you could get the seafood menu):   - white asparagus \"panina cotta\" with french almonds and citrus  - caviar with haricots verts salad, lemon grass  - light pea veloute on top of sweet onion custard  - jus of artichokes  - grilled kobe beef, bone marrow, hearts of palm, spiral of potatoes  - sliced strawberry in poppy syrup, marshmellow in white chocolate, strawberry milkshake  Everything was delicious and the plating was very creative.  However, nothing was really to die for and I don't know if I would pay over $300 (after tax/tip) for that meal again.  I read other reviews that raved about the meal and noticed reference to the crustacean menu.  Who knows, maybe it would've been worth forking out the additional $75 for it.  Either way, it was a very pleasant experience and the service was excellent.  They come out with an impressive desert cart at the end of the meal where they plate all the desert pieces you choose.  And they also give you a pan of banana bread to take home with you.  The food was excellent but I think I prefer French Laundry, which was also less than Robuchon.  Something worth mentioning, while we were dining, we noticed photographers near the entrance.  Turns out it was Tony Parker/Eva Longoria, and they ended up dining behind us.  :)",

    "text": "I visited Joel Robuchon - Las Vegas last week. Since this restaurant is first and only 3 star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas, honestly, my expectation was very high. I had a four course menu with a pan-fried sea bass for entree. It was a very good and high class restaurant but I couldn't find anything special. I liked a pan-fried sea bass but again, nothing special. I was impressed by a variety of breads that they offered but nothing WOW to me.... It was a fine dining that I enjoyed very much but I doubt of my future visit to this restaurant. Additionally, now Vegas strip has a lot of newer high class hotels such as Wynn, Encore and Palazzo, I believe that this restaurant should move to the new hotel to appeal their customers.",

The price would have been worth it but the service was truly mediocre.  Not that we needed to be fawned over, but were given no time to linger over the courses, had to wave down the bread lady and spent about 30 seconds with the wine steward (he pointed at 2 bottles of wine, both excellent, but no discussion of alternatives, etc).  All in all, the food is worth a visit, but do not expect much in the way of personalized service.",

My brother and I opted for the 7 course meal with wine pairing.  I'm sad we didn't have the patience for the 16 course, but we might have just died right there in the restaurant after experiencing one of the most powerful waves of food coma in my life.  The small palate opener of caviar and crab was absolutely delightful.  Highlights would be the uni and langostine, super fresh, very sweet and succulent.  The braised veal cheek was melt in your mouth.  The duck and fois gras were superbly executed.  Also had this savory lettuce veloute soup, which they pour into your bowl tableside.  The sommelier and servers provided top notch service.  They even go back and warm up your bread after you select from the huge bread cart.  Suffice it to say, the meal cost an arm and a leg, perhaps all four limbs. But it's some of the best food I've ever eaten.",

    "text": "This was simply the best dining experience of my life. I could write a chapter on each dish! Every dish was beautiful as if put together by a surgeon. Every course was delicately balance and complementary. The service was out of this world. The wine was delightful. We went all out had champagne to start, 2 bottles of wine (we gave the sommelier a price range for each bottle and he came back under our range and the wine was awesome.) Make sure you opt for the 16 course menu and while you're spending a mortgage payment on dinner, you might as well get the cheese cart as well (it was awesome!!!!!) We walked out with tip right at $1200.00. I know this is a lot of money and my wife had a severe problem with the money until after the meal when she proclaimed \"Until now I wouldn't have spent that much money on anything that only lasted 4 hours especially food but I would go back to Joel Robuchon anytime and spend it again\" and I agree.",

    "text": "It was the lifetime dinning.  The atmosphere, interior, service were just exceptionally amazing. We picked the 11th courses dinning, that consider to be the most signature pre-fix menu (9 courses and 2 deserts $495 per person). The presentation and the flavor a were killing the same as sommelier assistance. I never had eaten so many delicacy at the same time like foie gras, shaved and crispy black truffles, black caviar, truffled langoustine ravioli, lobster in green curry, chestnut cream, gold leaf, etc... The price was reasonable in evaluation of the Joel Robuchon brand, food, service, venue and experience.  I'd say that this restaurant  number 2 after Le Luis XV , Monte Carlo,  Monaco, and number one before Le Jules Verne , Paris, France. However there are other option for the dinning, with 7 courses -$295,5 courses - $195-175,2 courses- $150-125 pre-fix menus per person. The dinning approximately takes from 2.5 to 3.5 hours.",

    "text": "If this review would be just about the food, I would have awarded them 5 stars.  I am taking off a star for what I would call the bare minimum service- that at times was curt and never once had personality or showed a passion for the food at hand.  Part of the problem is we never really knew who was in charge of our table...there were a myriad of people that came and went with each course and never lingered long enough for us to recognize the face at the next course.  This also may have been because we were a table of 8 that required a set menu.  Even so, I would have expected someone to take us through the menu and explain the food as it was served.  I had to constantly ask for this and one time the server just pointed to our menu in response to a request for a description.  So I guess the moral of the story is not to go as a large group...which is defined by them as more than six.  I think you will get the full five star experience and avoid the $75 large party fee and a mandatory 20% gratuity for average service.",

    "text": "I ate at L'Atelier on opening day, and another four times since then. While the excitement of going to a great new restaurant is gone, the quality remains. L'Atelier isn't cheap, but it serves the best food of any restaurant in its price range. If you like innovative food that tastes great, you owe it to yourself to try this place.  The best way to sample what L'Atelier has to offer is to get the tasting menu. It varies a little over time, but remains recognizable. Here are notes from my 1st meal (I took better notes then): * Vegetable Fondant Topped With a Delicate Avocado Cream. A small martini glass with a layer of tomato gelee, soft yet firm, smooth, bright red, with an intense tomato flavor. On top, thick avocado cream/puree, bright green and delicious. Take a spoon and get a bit of both layers; it looks beautiful on the spoon and tastes just as good.. * La Langoustine Carpaccio With Roasted Poppy Seed Dressing. A rectangle, paper thin, with micro chives, pepper, and lemon oil. It's a tiny portion but with strong flavor and a soft, melting texture. * Les Huitres: Poached Baby Kumamoto Oysters With French Echre [sp?] Salted Butter. Three tiny oysters with salty butter on top, with black pepper; warmed briefly. I don't like oysters, but these were terrific! Perhaps I've been eating oysters in the wrong places. * L'Oeuf: Egg Cocotte Topped With a Light Mushroom Cream. Another dish served in a martini glass. In the bottom, some bright green parsley puree. Next a raw egg. The glass is then steamed, cooking the egg white but not the yolk. On top, a frothy, flavorful cream of mushroom soup, with a couple of pieces of chanterelle mushroom on top of that. Another wonderful combination of flavors; another case where I wasn't so sure I'd like it, but did. * Le Foie Gras: Rich, soft but slightly brown on the outside. I loved it. * Le Morue: Fresh Cod Filet in Vegetable Broth. The broth had a drop of basil oil, giving it an interesting flavor. The cod was barely cooked through, wrapped in a very thin piece of ravioli.  Excellent! * An extra treat, compliments of the chef: a papillote of langoustine. This was a generous piece of langoustine wrapped in a thin layer of phyllo dough, and quickly fried. * La Caille: Free-range Quail Stuffed With Foie Gras, With Truffled Potato Puree. Two small pieces of quail, good flavor, firm but not dry. Now about the potato puree - potatoes can't be this good! They take raw potatoes, and rub them against a fine sieve. They're pureed with lots and lots of butter, and some snippets of chive are added. All of this is covered with a layer of thin truffle slices.  Incredible! [note: the next time I went, they used much less truffle, but it was still excellent]. * La Framboise: Raspberry Jelly Madam Yuzu and Citrus Cream. The jelly was not too sweet, not too thick, with very intense flavor. The citrus cream was thick and delicious. There were several very large, ripe seedless raspberries. * Le Chocolat: Chocolate Sensation Cremeux Araguai, Oreo Cookie Crumbs.\" Yes, a second dessert; my kind of place. This was a tiny portion that is in the running for my favorite dessert ever. At the bottom was (I think) a bit of bitter, thick caramel. Above that, thick, very dark Valrhona chocolate. Above that (or to the side) was something like a ball of ice cream - I can't describe it very well, but it was delicious. Finally, some finely crumbled Oreo cookie, and a thin piece of chocolate in the form of a ring, forming a cover with a hole in the middle. [sad note: this dessert has gone downhill over time.  There is no longer any caramel, and the chocolate layer is more like a regular chocolate mouse.] Rating of VG - very good, but nothing like the dessert last time. * The meal ended with a choice of cappuccino or espresso; I chose cappuccino. It was rich, not bitter, and came with rough cubes of brown sugar and white sugar.  Not a single course was merely good. Everything was beautifully presented. At almost any other restaurant, any of the courses I had at L'Atelier would have been a star of the entire meal.  I've also ordered a la carte, but space limitation prevent a full description.  A couple of highlights: * La Lisette: Fresh mackerel on a thin tart with Parmesan shavings and olives. Almost like a tiny, thin pizza. The flavors were strong; the very thin crust was very flaky. Simple food wonderfully prepared. * Le Homard: Maine lobster salad with a sherry vinegar dressing. A very generous amount of sweet lobster, in a strongly flavored but not overpowering dressing, served on top of greens. Very simple, but expertly prepared.  **UPDATE October 2007: I tried the tasting menu yet again.  It's changed a little, e.g.: halibut instead of cod; new desserts; a much smaller portion of potato puree. However, it's not that different, and the quality is as good as ever.",

    "text": "The food, the service, the quality, the creativity & artistry, the presentation, the ENTIRE experience is absolutely 5-star class. My fiance and I came thinking we would get a 3 course meal, but the feel of Vegas permeating through us for our weekend getaway made us teeter and ultimately decide to go for the 16-course Menu Degustation. Fantastic choice!  The experience started with the MGM Gold Limo -- call in to request it when you make your reservation, it is usually slated to arrive 15 minutes before your actual reservation if you are on the strip. The driver knows the back way to get to the MGM hotel so you arent going to be sitting in much traffic and so you are driven to \"The Mansion,\" an exclusive part of the MGM hotel that looks like an Italian courtyard with flowers, plants and a fountain in the center. The hostess is radio-ed of your presence by the driver and then you are escorted through The Mansion (it was actually quite a long walk, made to feel even longer in the 3 inch heels I was wearing, ouch!) to the Casino area where Joel Robuchon sits (next to the L'Atelier and KA Cirque performance, which we went to see the night before and it was fabulous!).   There are booths with a loveseat feel in the corners of the room and more informal booths in the center of the indoor seating. There is also \"outdoor\" seating which is made to feel almost like a garden terrace with a vine covered wall -- of course you know you're still inside. Decor is plush and luscious, with touches of sweetness and lace.   Still water is bottled and charged $10 per bottle -- just a heads up since I didn't realize this until I got the bill but when you just spent about $400.00 per person for dinner, that's a penny in the bucket. Perhaps I'm just a fast eater but the entire 16 courses took just about 3.5 hours, and I DID savor, I promise! The bread cart opens your meal, it is taken back to the kitchen to be heated and I chose about 10 different breads to try because when else are you going to have so much selections such as saffron infused or basil infused bread.   I won't break down the entire 16 course meal, you will have to experience that yourself one day, but it is absolutely worth the money. The creativity behind each thoughtfully envisioned course and the absolute perfect execution is more than you can hope for in a dining experience. The fanciful presentation of each course was pretty for the eyes but even if you took that away, I'd still be quite impressed with the food. Some brief highlights to me: the careful layering of each thin slice of truffle with foie gras, langoustine prepared to tenderness, a ravioli made of sea lettuce, risotto of soybean sprout heads (not grains), and a perfectly prepared scrambled egg with asparagus within a golden buttery toasted crust. As if dessert wasn't enough, you had your choice of unlimited chocolates from the dessert cart with again, a huge selection of in-house sweets and the special occasion dessert surprise was an actual HUGE tropical ice cream cake!   The executive chef that night was Chef Claude Le Tohic and he came out to greet us, most likely because we got the tasting menu and he talked to us for quite a bit to make sure we were enjoying the food. I rained so many praises on him -- even told him it was better than French Laundry in my mind! He's a really relaxed guy, he told me to tell the dessert servers that I was to take many goodies home, which I was not afraid or ashamed to do. Anything I could take home from that dessert cart, I absolutely did! As a guest of Joel Robuchon who has experience the Menu Degustation, you come home with a booklet of your meal, a printed certificate with the date and all your courses consumed, and a box of in-house deserts, which was overkill with the tons of chocolates and caramels I already took from the dessert cart (I don't think that's typical).  The limo drove us home with full bellies and a memory that will last me a lifetime. Delicious and I will absolutely be back!",

The colors and textures are beautiful. Rather than go into a blow-by-blow of our evening, which many others have done really well, I will say that we enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish.

For: *Absolute attention to detail...you even gave my vintage handbag it's own pretty little purple perch, on which to rest, for the duration of the evening on my first visit. *The bread cart. Aaaah, that lardon bread, gruyere brioche, saffron brioche, bagette....bread, beautiful bread. *Oh, and the butter. *The delightful, professional, enjoyable service. *The artistry of each dish. *The sauces...inspiring enough for me to lose all sense of civility and use my finger to get to the bottom of that one little dish to get the very last bit of the sauce. *Making me giggle becaue the crunch of the frog leg fritter was so impressive. *The wine pairing!  Wow. *The ability to create a seamless service even though I ordered the long menu and my date ordered the short...wow, now that's impressive. *The timing of everything. *The cheese!!! Oh my stars, the cheese!  And the fact that you were kind enough to write down each cheese we had eaten along with a description for each, (including the one that we had described as \"puppy-breath butt-stank\" I was mortified that y'all had obviously overheard us...the funny thing is, that one was my favorite). *The little petit fours cart.  It was so beautiful, along with the  you sent home with us. I cannot thank you enough for being as impressive, considerate, and wonderful as my date for the eveing is.  I must have done something wonderful in a past-life to have had the good fortune to dine here more than once and look forward to my next visit.",

He was right on with his selections.  He chose a chardonnay that was minerally and not too creamy, something I wouldn't have chosen if I had tasted it on its own.  But with the seafood course it was spot on.  That's why he's the expert.  If you're not staying at MGM take advantage of the free limo service and see how the high rollers live for an evening.  Arrive through the secluded Mansion entrance and be escorted through the inner sanctum of the whales.  Even if you are staying at MGM take a cab down the strip and use the limo anyway to get the full lux experience.",

    "text": "Hands down the best meal I've had in Vegas... perhaps the best meal I've had period. First the ambiance. It's quite unique and spectacular. The details, the colors, the flowers, the chandelier... it all comes together beautifully and works very well for Vegas. Next, the service -  spectacular. Best service I've ever had. This is the problem I have with a lot of SF restaurants (read: Zuni Cafe, Sebo...). Just because you have good food doesn't mean you can slack on the service. Well Joel Robuchon does not disappoint. We had numerous people come by and explain different meals, options, etc. over the course of the night and our main waiter was phenomenal. Sweet, well spoken, knew all the dishes and gave great recommendations. The food - wow. Started with a caviar and crab dish. It was amazing. We started dinner close to 11 pm so didnt have time to do the 16 course tasting menu... must come back for this. I ordered the salmon tartar. Presentation was stunning and tasted very very good.  I had the duck and foie gras for my main course and it was by far the best duck I have ever had. Combining it with the fruit and foie gras made the dish amazing.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle, some apple or pear dish and then they sent out another dessert (pineapple I think?) because it had taken a while to seat us. Again, all were amazing. But separate from the actual courses, I would have been content with the bread and chocolate cart alone! The bread cart was phenomenal...so many good ones (favorites include the milk bread and bacon bread). And then after the dessert, the chocolate cart! Dream come True! There were sooo many different choices the waiter lost me after the 5th thing... I think there were 40 or 50 different types of chocolates, macaroons, marshmellows etc. they make inhouse. I asked him to recommend his favorites and he did a great job of picking (as he had down with the breads). And finally, they sent me home with a full bag of chocolate for the next day. They were not at all stingy about how many chocolates I could have that night and gave me a decent number to take home.  Overall, couldn't have asked for more. One of the most memorable meals I've ever had and can't wait to return and try the 16 course menu. In the last 2 weeks I've had the opportunity to eat at a lot of great restaurants (Pierre Gagnaire's new place in the Mandarin, Okada, Eleven Madison, Jean George, Le Bernadin, Gilt...) and this was by far the best meal and experience and that is a pretty high bar of competing establishments. Wouldn't have changed a thing.",

Even though my boyfriend and I ordered 2 entrees and 1 dessert, we came out stuffed.   The ambiance: quiet and formal. Seriously...I kind of messed up which spoon to use and it made me nervous. But it's bright with very nice flowers..   To start, they gave us caviar surprise on the house. I even mentioned to the waiter, we didn't order the tasting menu, but they said everyone gets one. WOW. It was really good. Basically it was some creme, crab meat, and spices topped with caviar. Very nice.   Then, again on the house, was a pea soup. Quite nice too.   Then came the bread cart. It has like 20 varieties for you to choose from. At this point, I was already full.   Then came the main course, I had lobster and my boyfriend had veal. The lobster was topped with cubes of truffles. The sauce was infused with flavor. There was a side of gold leaves, but that was more for decoration. I ate it anyways.    The veal was very evenly braised. Very flavorful as well. It had a side of pesto noodles and olives. Quite filling. They cut it in two portions and leave the 2nd portion in a heater so it's still warm while you are eating the 1st portion. Also, the 2nd portion came with a flavorful mini salad.   Then we had our dessert, the chocolate souffle. It was alright. Nothing really too special. Should have gone with something more unique.   Then we had complementary ice cream: caramel, vanilla, or raspberry sorbet.   Last was the tray of desserts. They have everything from chocolate truffles to French macarons. I was way too stuffed but everything was oh so good.   Oh yes, I got to bring home lemon cake. Not like one slice, it's an entire loaf.   So I understand that prices for each dish is steep, but it includes so much more. Also, the ingredients are high-end ingredients, and they give a generous amount of those ingredients. Therefore, it was quite a justified price to pay for, in addition to their unbeatable service and attention to detail.   BTW, glass of champagne is $35. Flat water is $10 for the table. Lobster was $150. Veal was $100. Souffle was $25. That's the ball park of things.   Appetizers are $65 to $100.   So, for a good occasion, I think it's a decent place to go once or twice a year, but not daily, unless you are rich. Not everything will blow you away, but the flavors will.",

    "text": "Agree wholeheartedly with others' ***** rating. Fabulous experience.  My friend and I each chose the \"Three Course Menu ($168/Person)-worth every penny! Epicurean-heaven: so many flavors & textures in each bite-creative genius! Delightful presentation. (Only dish my friend thought was not up to par was the spiny lobster/langouste, as the lobster itself was too rubbery, although sauce delicious).   Excellent, substantial meal. As far as we could tell, this includes as much as you want from both bread-cart & sweets-cart (Les Mignardises). Bread is warmed after choosing from bread-cart's extensive offerings. (Wasn't shy-had tried 3 breads [olive oil brioche-yum!] & several sweets after main dessert).   Gorgeous decor. Very helpful, professonal wait-staff. Excellent service (attentive but not hovering, not pretentious). Unlike another recent reviewer's experience, our main waiter was warm & friendly.  IMHO, Joel Robuchon sets the highest bar in Las Vegas. Fantastic! Best overall dining experience we've had yet in the U.S. (although have not yet tried French Laundry in Napa or Manresa in Los Gatos, CA, the food quality by which another friend swears).   3-course prix fixe dinner included more than expected (see below &  details in others' positive reviews). Drinks are additional cost.   If you are planning on seeing a Vegas-show after dinner, allow enough time to savor the experience (for 3-course menu, consider making dinner reservations at least 2.5 to 3 hours ahead of show-time). Women's bathroom is only for one person at a time (don't wait until you are in a rush before a show). _____  \"3 course menu\" includes:  L'Amuse-bouche (caviar & crab-wow!) *** Breads (large bread selection-choose from bread cart) & Appetizer (I had chosen the cheese souffle in flavorful sauce with black truffle slices, add +$40)-would not recommend if cost a concern *** Soup *** One Main Course *** Dessert & Les Mignardises (extensive sweets selection)",

Thinking that he know how much a cook get paid he would recommend something way off the price line, but holy mother of god. i wish the waiter would actually explain to us that this is a prefix menu no matter what you order. and the fact that water was offer but didn't give the option of tap water..if i knew i would  just stick to wine. $10 for water? really? I had the currie lobster which was two 2 oz piece of lobster plus a 1 oz stuff squid. oh yeah and  the size of half my pinky potato.. which didn't taste like currie at all. food was not hot enough. the dessert was pretty good.. thank god i fill up on bread if not i would have to stop by a taco stand or micky d's. So for the size of a tapas and a desserts your looking at $127 plus $10 water plus $30 for tax plus tips=180 per person..if you don't sh*t out money, its not worth the experience.",

    "text": "If you only have one meal in Las Vegas eat at Joel Robuchon.  I daresay I prefer Robuchon to the vaunted French Laundry.   Drinks:  I ordered a pear martini to start, I wanted a cucumber martini, but the bar didn't have the ingredients this was a nice consolation prize. Bruno Paillard 'Brut Ros Premire Cuve', Reims, NV: Fairly light in color for a Ros, the nose leads with light hints of young fruit with some minerality.  On the palette the wine is light and acidic a nice way to start a meal. Dr. Bernkasteler Badstube, Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, Wegeler, 2004: The very definition of off-dry.  This wine had classic flavors of orchard fruit and minerals with an edge of acidity. Shafer Merlot, Napa Valley, 2004: A very straightforward wine, intense flavors of ripe fruit, very uniform and easy drinking.  I tend to shy away from merlot but this was very approachable. Domaine Alain Brumont, Pacherenc du Vic Bihl 'Brumaire', 2004: I was leaning towards a Sauternes for dessert but having never had a Pacherenc before decided to try this instead.  I detected aromas of ripe apricot and necatrines and a hint of spice, a highly concentrated palette and lingering finish round out this wine.  Naturally when sampling perfection one should be sure to get as much as possible, my friends and I did the 16 course menu.  L'Avocat - Avocado puree in a thin herb gelee and olive oil flavored curd cheese  Le Caviar - Green Asparagus topped with Oscetra caviar, delicate gelee and a smooth cauliflower cream, thin couscous and oscetra caviar  Le Saint-Jacques - Pan seared scallops with fregolas pastas and coral emulsion  La Langoustine - Truffled langoustine ravioli with stewed cabbage  La Symphonie de Truffe - Black Truffle in hot pastry, onions and smoked ham, Fall vegetables in green cabbage ravioli, Light truffle cream on top of custard  L'Ormeau - Abalone, baby leeks in a ginger bouillon  L'Amadai - Amadai (tile fish) in a lily bulb broth  Le Turbot - Roasted turbot \"on the bone\" with celery and truffle stew  Le Boeuf - Grilled Kobe beef, roasted foie gras with port, cheese macaronis, black pepper cristalline  L'Epeautre - Sault farrow prepared risotto style, gold leaf  La Poire William - William pear on a sorbet and confit in black currant  Le Chocolat - Melting Araguani chocolate with a hint of peppermint  La Crme Glace - Raspberry sorbet, vanilla and coffee ice cream, and an orange tuile  La Cafe ou le The - escorte de mignardises  For a full review check out my blog.  Be warned perfection has its price and ours came out to 775 a head.",

I don't think there is much more I can say about the food or any better way to explain how wonderful it was then the other raving fans before me.  The service was exceptional.  Hubby and I were planning on going back to the hotel in the afternoon, before dinner, to change and dress up, not celebrating anything, just enjoying each others company... but we didn't have enough time to go change so we went in our let's romp around Vegas clothes while every other couple in the place was all dressed up.  Not that any of the staff cared, they were happy to have us.  But to tell you the truth being in casual clothes made the experience that much more fun and relaxing.   We loved the food, and the service... the bread cart was awesome, the desert cart with all those yummy little sugar heavens on it was amazing... if it was up to me I would have rolled it out of there back to my hotel so I can try everyone of them.  After 16 courses, I was in a food comma so desert was not fitting well in my tiny stomach.   A wonderful experience... French Laundry is next.  Then we can compare.",

I chose this one after my girlfriend stumbled upon it and the staff let us see the dining room and the bread and candy cart.  What a treat!! I know that not everyone will experience the living art that is eating at this place. Known for being the best restaurant in the world in Paris, Joel Robuchon has brought some of his staff here to us. Having eaten many many course dinners before we opted for the smaller six course dinner and ordered a single bottle of wine instead of a pairing (still 800$). This once in a lifetime dinner was so fun, and amazing!! Being sent home with a loaf of the most amazing orange bread I've had. This is an obvious splurge, and a celebratory dinner, I thank my generous boyfriend for making the night feel so special and the dinner one I will never forget.",

    "text": "Joel Rubuchon restaurant is the first and only 3 Star Michelin Guide Winner in Las Vegas so I don't need to talk about how great their food is. But I will talk about the reason why they are so expensive (besides their gotta-have-before-I-die mouthwatering dishes).  Bread cart: they have this bread cart that they roll to every single table (as many times as you like). You can pick from 20+ different mini bread rolls, sticks, etc. You can ask for as many servings as you like and they will take it to the kitchen, toast it up for you, and bring them back to your table all nice and warm.   Cheese cart: I love the most foul, smelliest cheese they can stand to serve in restaurants. I will eat them up!  At Gary Danko, you can only pick a few selections from the cart but at Joel Rubuchon--you can eat til your heart is content!   Mignardises cart: as you walk into the restaurant, you see a huge cart of mini chocolates, hard candies, assorted cookies, etc. just waiting for you to devour. We only had two hours to dine then had to rush out to watch KA next door, so I didn't get my pick from the Mignardises cart. Damn the 6-course tasting menu!  I was so sad. I wished I had asked them to pack some to-go but was too scared to ask. Make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours to dine!  And last but certainly not least: Service & Decor: Every time you get up out of your seat, you get a new napkin. WTH is that really necessary? I guess so if you're paying $700+ for two people. The table setting was over the top -like those platinum weddings you see on WEtv for the ridiculously rich folks.  There's a grand piano, beautiful chandeliers with strings of peals hanging from them, fresh flower vases everywhere. And I mean EVERYWHERE. We were seated \"outdoor\", the entire restaurant is inside the MGM hotel but they have an area where they decorated to look like you're dining on the garden patio.  The entire restaurant was breathtaking. I love the smell and feel of flowers, so for me to be dining surrounded by them was heaven. And it seemed like they had as much servers/employees in the restaurant as customers dining... make sense bc you need a cheese chart person, bread cart person, a change the napkin person, someone to stand near the bathroom and point you to the right direction person, and two different hostess; one to greet, one to open the door for you. And this is all on top of the regular people you would need for a restaurant. Am I exaggerating? No, at least that's what it seemed like... but I'm not complaining.   Please please starve yourself for this meal! We had a late lunch at Diego earlier that day so I was not as hungry as I wanted to be for this dinner. I didn't eat much of the bread and the cheese (had to save my appetite for the courses ) yes, I was kicking myself for that! :(  Expensive but a must try at least once in your life! I can't wait to come back! Next time, the 16-course tasting! :)",

    "text": "The irony is that I spent more on this meal than any other in my life and enjoyed it the least.  I would never order a single thing that I ate here ever again.  Some of the most bland, non-descript, unimpressive food that I have eaten anywhere.  And before you assume that I simply \"do not appreciate good food\", let it be known that I just returned from Sonoma where I dined at Thomas Keller's French Laundry and eat regularly at Gary Danko in San Francisco.  Let me start with the four best parts of Joel Robuchon at the Mansion.  The bartender in the lounge was cool, knowledgable and professional.  The drinks were ridiculous, but the bartender was great.  Second, the atmosphere is impressive, albeit a bit outlandish.  It's amazing how quiet it is in here, you would never know that you were in loud Las Vegas.  Third, the bread cart is outstanding.  There are many different types of amazing breads, and you had best load up on them if you dont plan to grab a burger somewhere else before you go to bed.  Last was the included sorbets.  My favorite part of the meal.  As for the 6 course crustacean menu itself, it was not good.  One seafood gel in an egg cup with sea urchin roe (tasty, probably the best item), two tiny lobster \"raviolis\" (not very exciting), one shrimp wrapped in a spider-web like pastry with asparagus and caviar (very basic and unimpressive), a half-ping pong ball sized lump of king crab (blah), another ball of lobster served in a bowl with broth (very blah),  and then a raspberry gel desert which was tasty.  My friend had the cheaper menu and it looked far better.  The Kobe beef dish was amazing, far and away the best thing on the table.  In short, this meal was boring, with common -place ingredients, small and very, very expensive ($350).  The servers rarely described the food, and were only around to refill the very, very expensive water.  Service here should be ridiculously good, and it was just the opposite.  The sommelier was annoying and not as knowledgable as you would expect.  Gary Danko and French Laundry are far , far better and, although also expensive, much more worthy of your money.",

For the price, definitely you are paying a premium for being in Vegas...it was probably $ overprice...but hey, if you have that much michelin stars, i guess you can charge that much.   You can request them to pick you up in a limo from your hotel...which was great, and you enter this special gated courtyard which is really elegant.  so, food!  yup...as you can see from the pictures...they do well in presentation....and thankfully, it tastes as good as it looks.  I liked the combination of flavors, and each dish was very distinct and defined well. The bread cart is insane! as wierd as it sounds, the butter is also amazing...all the bread is so fresh and perfect.  You can get full with that alone...so dont go nuts. after that, you just eat what they give you... and if you have high cholesterol, this is probably not good for you... coz' its a lot of the good stuff that'll kill you. the flavors are diverse and well timed.  Prepare to stay there for 4-5 hours. In the end, the dessert cart comes out..and it is as impressive as the bread cart.  Don't be shy....take as much as you want! :)  they are so delicious!  the decor was very tasteful and elegant...i'd return for a super special occasion or i'd like to try his other place next door.",

Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess greeted me by name.  How she knew who I was creeped me out a bit, but it did make me feel special.  We were seated immediately in their \"garden\" area.  I could go into mouth-watering detail about very morsel, but it'd be easier just to tell you what surprised me about this place:  1.  The plating seemed to be designed specifically for each dish (and probably was).  There were several patterns that at first looked like part of the plate until I realized it was made out of food.  Astounding.  2.  2 bites of 16 courses will fill you up.  By the 9th, I was already stuffed.  If I ever do this type of endurance eating, I will only eat a bite or two of each dish.  3.  Many of the wait staff spoke French.  4.  The food was all extremely rich and almost everything had truffles or gold leaf (or both) in it.  Finally, after that meal, I could have used a hot dog for my next meal.  Or, a bucket of KFC.",

It the was best steak that we have had in a while, the flavors were exceptional, and the textures were perfect.  Les Desserts:  Le Jasmin-Jasmine Tea Chantilly with pineapple and lemon confit-very light, not bold jasmine flavor, but balanced texture and sweetness. La Violette-violet cream, yogurt sorbet and blueberry compote...very smooth, yogurt gave a bit of tartness, blueberry was bursting with flavor. L'Hibiscus-creamy hibiscus emulsion, and apple granite'...this was sort of disappointing as the hibiscus can be quite tart, and was not in this case...it's a great flavor potential that was not lived up to.  Le Chocolat-cocoa pods of chocolate and salted caramel semifreddo-basically salted caramel ice cream with chocolate.  Nothing wrong with that!  We asked for a shared pot of Earl Grey tea and chose from the little treats on what they call the \"chocolat cart\".  I had the banana eclair, the blueberrry violet tea cake, the opera cake, a caramel macaron...and that's all I remember.  The tea cake had liquid fruit in the center, dipped in white chocolate, and was amazing.  My wife makes a much better macaron.  The bill with generous tip was $1,400.00...definitely a splurge for us, and a big one at that.  The presented us with the menus(which we later found out were personalized, nice touch, there!) and the parting favor tea cake, in a lovely mini-shopping bag, which was delicious.  I waddled out of the restaurant 3 1/2 hours after being seated, stuffed to the gills, and happy, happy, happy!!!  Maybe in another 10 years.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to this dinner for a very long time!  Hawaii has amazing asian and fusion food, but not too many French restaurants.. I definitely wanted to try something different that I wouldn't find at home!    Reservations were made for two at 6pm by our Amex concierge, but she made it for L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, even though I thought I had made it very clear I wanted Joel Robuchon..which is the restaurant to the right and next to L'Atelier.  The menu that I wanted to try I knew would take about three hours, but luckily they were able to switch the reservation and get us in at 5:45pm!  I normally don't eat early but we had tickets for Cirque du Soleil \"O\", so we had to have enough time to eat but also to enjoy our food!  Give yourself a few hours to eat here and take your time, it's very worth it!   I love having a variety of food to eat (eating only one or two dishes isn't fun for me), so I knew I had to have the degustation menu.  I believe it was 18 courses, and every bite was amazing!  I can't get into detail because every course honestly can't be put into words, every bite was to be savored and there is nothing like this in Hawaii.  It is definitely worth trying, forget the price tag and just treat yourself to a wonderful, one of a kind meal!  You could order the course set (where you can choose a couple of appetizers, entrees and dessert) but you might not get the satisfaction nor the full experience that comes with ordering the carefully planned out Degustation.  The chance to sample Joel Robuchon's signature dishes in his 3 Michelin star restaurant was definitely a once in a lifetime experience!    At the end of our meal, executive chef  Claude Le-Tohic came out to say hi and we got to take a picture with him!  I mean, I figured someone who was running the kitchen of the only three star Michelin restaurant in Vegas would be a little arrogant (and rightfully so), but he was the nicest, most humble chef I have ever met.  He even saw us outside by the slots and said hi! I was so happy! Best dining experience I have had yet!",

First, the bread cart! A large cart filled with an assortment of bread is brought to your table.  You get to make your own bread basket...plan ahead my lady friends, I definitely didn't go rocking a leger that night...  Next the courses start. Food is rich, but portions are small...so they kind of balance each other out. They do have dishes that are on the healthy side if that's what you are looking for.  Dessert, a large dessert cart is brought table side.  A cake stand is placed on your table and you just pick as many mini desserts as you like.  The detail is beautiful, they look so cute you almost don't want to eat them! Annnndddd then....yes I was a glutton that night, my regular dessert came. Chocolate souffle, so airy and light(haha not really though).  Lastly, another large cart full of fresh herbs is brought table side where you make your own pot of fresh tea.  So many different types of mint.   The experience alone is worth the visit",

Awkward! Three michelin stars......dont think so!    The service from our waiter from that point on was exquisite.  These guys probably get one turn a night and has to service probably 3 tables.  They work hard and our waiter was good at it.  Having to explain the bread and sweets carts alone deserves a $50 tip right there.   Unfortunately, the food did not match up to the excellent service.  When dining at a michelin rated restaurant, you expect excellent service and that wow factor in the dishes.  My favorite dish was a spaghetti with a soft boiled egg and black truffle shaving (which was $70 supplement).  I honestly can't remember the other dishes i ate.  I reviewed the pictures i took and still can't remember.  The only wow factor was the dessert cart which literally contained at least 50 different bites from macrons to cake bites, to creme brulee - too much to even name a few.  Another nice touch was a full loaf of lemon pound cake they gave my wife to take out, packaged in a nice joel rubuchon bag.  She snacked on that for the next few nights and loved it.  $800 for four course meal for two, no alcohol was not worth it, sorry.",

There were 6 of us and 4 didn't speak English so to make it easier my wife just ordered the 5 course and added truffles caviar and focus gras for everyone.   I kind of felt like we got what they wanted to get rid of and not what was best. Was very disappointed that fois gras was terrine that was just thinly rolled to look pretty and not actually fois gras. The dish with cod had an unbelievably salty sauce that went with it. The dish that came with steak was extremely tough.   The ravioli were the highlight for sure. They were exceptional. Bread is no longer rolled out between each course and continually updated on variety. Instead you get a bread bowl with a variety for everyone to grab from and a one time visit to view cart while they describe what is there.   I would agree with another review about sommelier. It took a long time to get our wine and we only got 1 bottle due to this. Probably would have had 3 easily if a little more on top of it. They were quick to fill water though. Who knows? Maybe better margins.   Real disappointment was overall lack of flavor. Maybe they have a new chef. Maybe Tuesday is head chefs night off. Not really sure",

    "text": "Pretty amazing place - all the other recent reviews I read were spot on so I won't go into all the details.  2 important things though that I had fairly recently that aren't the case, at least not anymore.  1)  The limo service is no longer available.  They stopped doing it at the end of last year.  Bummer.  The restaraunt is right next to the Ka Cirque show at MGM so if you are coming in around showtime it's quite a mess over there - and loud although we couldn't really hear anything while we were in the restaurant. 2) If you want to eat the 16 course - everyone at the table has to do it.  I had read that wasn't the case fairly recently but my wife wanted the 4 course and I was going to do the 16 and the waiter informed us that everyone at the table had to do the 16 course.  Oh well.    She did the 4 course and I did the 5 course and it was more than enough food for both of us.  The food was amazing and the service was perfection.  This is really more of an experience than just a dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed that.  This is not a cheap dinner - for the two of us including wine (we both had 3 glasses) the bill was $900 not including the tip.  So, save your pennies. :)  Well worth it though - one of the best meals I've ever had and certainly one of the best dining experiences.  Also worth noting that the 'business formal' is certainly not enforced.  My wife and I were dressed that way and I wore a jacket but half of the folks in the restaurant were business casual at best, including the Asian couple that sat next to us.  At a place like this - I would like to think that they would enforce that but I guess when you have people coming in willing to spend a grand or more on dinner you don't rock the boat.    As others have mentioned, the bread and desert carts are insane.  We wished we could have taken a truckload of that butter home with us.  We left with a nice pound cake that we brought home with us and plan on eating a couple pieces for desert tonight.  Great experience - not something we'll do every time we go to Vegas but no regrets for sure.",

    "text": "should have visited this page prior to my came-back visit to Robuchon, as one of other reviewers has pointed out that the food here is not worthy of the money any more. Typical dinner here of two would cost about 1000usd or more if you decide to try the chefs tasting menu. This was an experience that I was excited for. Two years ago, their chefs tasting menu was consisted of truffle, fois gras, scallops and uni.   But now, these ingredients have been replaced with \"one egg\", mushrooms, and pork dumpling for the socalled \"seasonal\" reasons, even though one other chef that we have visited called now \"a perfect season for uni\" due to the sweetness and creamy flavors. The Robuchon at MGM here is basically cheaping its dinner ingredients, but still charging over 450 per person for the chefs tasting menu.   They also used to have one entire steak with fois gras served per table. Now you would also have to ask to get another slice of your steak.   For ppl that have come here for the first time, the dining experience may still be unique with the fancy decoration and high class service in the restaurants. However, dining experience at such price is also about what you are served at the dinner. The taste is not something that can be replaced with fancy chandelier, pretty plating or suit-up servers.   I have no intention of recommending or ever coming back to this restaurant from my most recent dining experience at Robuchon.",

Joel Robuchon has been on our list of restaurants to try and it did not disappoint, this is fine dining at its best :)  Ambiance: 5 stars, the decor is classy, full of dark purple plush sofas and chandeliers with orchids everywhere.  It's very romantic :)  Service: 5 stars, from start to finish the wait staff was on hand and was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu  Food: -Bread Cart: OMG this bread trolley...I can just eat from this and this alone.  There are dozens of selections from bacon bread, classic baguettes, cheese bread etc. Go for the bacon bread! -Amuse bouche: a cold beet concoction that was supposed to wake up your pallet; it actually did!  -First course: Spicy Lobster with caviar, this dish was decadent and the lobster was so fresh and juicy! They also put real 24k gold flakes in there...lol..fancy fancy.                      Pumpkin soup: tiny portion but it was flavorful -Second course: Beef cheeks: Tender and delicious, and the whipped potatoes they served with it was so good!!                     Pork with truffles: This dish was a tad salty  -Dessert: Their dessert cart was out of this world.  If you like sweets you will NOT be disappointed!  I highly recommend the dark chocolate truffles, the macaroons...actually just try anything that catches your eye haha  Overall: 5 stars!  The price for the 3 course was $169, we both had the 3 course with some wine and our dinner bill was around $500.  It was worth every penny though! The price for the 16 course was over $400 a person, however, the older couple next to us had the 16 course and they assured us it was divine.  We will probably try that next time for a special occasion.  Location: In the MGM Grand next to KA.  I heard if you are staying at another hotel you can arrange for a gold limo to come pick you up in case you want to feel like a baller :)",

Pros: The restaurant is beautiful and the staff are pleasant and always at your service.  The bread cart and the dessert cart had over 15 variations of each and they were all delicious. By far the best part of the meal.  Cons: We got the 15 course tasting menu and a bottle of wine. We are both good eaters and like almost anything and there were some things I just ate because I couldn't fathom leaving on my plate because of how much money I was spending.   I guess I went in with high expectations given the price tag and was disappointed!",

    "text": "My husband and I came to experience Joel Robouchon for our birthday celebrations. We made reservation for 8:30 pm on Monday night.  We were seated promptly by the hostess   I ordered from the $198 four course menu (which includes amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, one entree, one dessert, and sweets) My husband ordered from the $169 two course menu (which includes amuse bouche, 1 appetizer, one entree, and sweets)  The service was good, but not impeccable We declined the wine, and had bottle of sparkling water for $10  The bread cart came out first, variety of artisan breads, my husbands favorite was the bacon bread and I like the flaky white puff pastry. fine butter and olive oil was provided They will bring more bread upon request at no additional charge  The amuse bouche was a beet puree, it was creamy with twist of citrus, very refreshing  The appetizers My husband ordered imperial caviar on king crab in crustacean gelee at a $65 supplement, this dish was divine the caviar was light, yet each bead was bursting with flavor...one can taste the essence of the ocean with each savory dollop. the king crab enhances the flavor of the caviar nicely the crustacean gelee does not overpower  My first appetizer was the spiced lobster in Daikon cream the lobster was chilled and very well prepared The second appetizer was the foie gras salad with artichoke the cold preparation of the foie gras is not our favorite but the richness of the foie gras was sublime  Entree My husband ordered the farm chicken with foie gras and roasted chestnuts with black truffles at $40 supplement. My husband throughly enjoyed his dish. the chicken is perfectly cooked and the foie gras was seared to perfection and melted in the mouth.   I ordered the sea bass. I was a little disappointed by this dish. I feel the sea bass was a little over cooked and bit on the salty side.  Dessert We shared the chocolate souffle at $15 supplement it came with dark chocolate ice cream (almost ganache like) and vanilla bean ice cream. sumptuous   the sweets cart came last too many variety to count we tried all the macaroons, including apple, hazelnut, pistachio; and loved all of them of note, the available baklava, creme brulee, and panna cotta was available to order from the kitchen We each had the creme brulee, this was delicious to the nth degree  take home message, save the money that you would otherwise gamble away at the casino to eat here  (This entry was written by my husband)",

Their service was excellent and our group of 5 were treated like royalties in probably the most beautiful restaurant I've ever been in.  It was pricey, we did the tasting menu. It was delicious and well worth it. We also did the wine pairings which I would probably wouldn't do again. A great sommelier could likely provide excellent recommendations for better value. We always tend to do the wine pairings with a tasting menu and this was the first time we weren't blown away.   Would highly recommend for a special occasion or celebration. It truly is an experience!",

    "text": "This being our first (and much anticipated) visit, we wanted to get the full experience, so we opted for the 16 course tasting menu for around $400 per person.  We also got a wine pairing, which is priced in tiers (around $250, $500, and $1000 per person, I believe).  We opted for the middle tier and the wines were outstanding, I can't even imagine what the top tier must be like!  Le Pain (the bread) - this is not your ordinary bread selection.  There are at least 15 types of bread offered including baguettes, puff pastry, basil or saffron brioche, and much more.  When you have made your (unlimited) selections, the servers warm them for you then shave a piece of butter off of a huge block (that gets its own cart) and sprinkle it with sea salt for you.  I could make a whole meal out of this bread cart, no joke.  La Cerise (the cherry) - cherry gazpacho with sheep ricotta ans pistachios.  Light and refreshing.  La Tomate (the tomato) - salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella.  We were instructed to place the tomato onto the gelee and eat them together.  A deconstructed caprese salad - this was interesting and tasty.  Le Caviar - three courses served at once - red turnip and butter coated radish with yellowtail carpaccio and caviar, chilled cauliflower veloute with bonito gelee and caviar, caviar and couscous maki roll.  This was one of the standout courses of the evening (how could it not be?), especially the carpaccio.  La Grenouille (the frog) - crispy frog leg, roasted garlic, parsley coulis.  Very meaty and succulent - this was one of my favorites.  La Saint-Jacques (name of a traditional French scallop dish) - seared scallop in a cauliflower veloute for me and a green curry for DH.  At the beginning of the meal, they ask for food allergies/preferences.  I specified \"no cilantro\", so they made a substitution for me.  They are very gracious and courteous about this.  Les Crustaces (the crustaceans) - three courses served at once - truffled langoustine ravioli with foie gras foam, sea urchin on potato puree with coffee, grilled spiny lobster medallion with herb sabayon.  This was one of the best courses, if not THE best, of the evening (especially the ravioli, which is one of their signature dishes).  Les Petit Pois (the little peas) - delicate green pea cream on top of foie gras with argan oil.  I enjoyed this much more than the earlier cherry soup.  Le Saumon (the salmon) - a perfectly medium salmon filet with grain mustard and mango \"tagliatelle\".  Another of my favorites.  Le Boeuf (the beef) - pepper crusted rib eye with capers, peppers, and mushrooms.  I was so full at this point that I could not eat more than a bite of this, but DH loved it.  Le Soja (the soybean) - soy risotto with lime and chives.  We were both too full to eat much of this.  La Fraise (the strawberry) - a caramel panna cotta with fresh strawberries, balsamic reduction, and creme fraiche foam.  Kind of like a deconstructed strawberry shortcake.  I don't know if it was because the end was in sight, or the change from savory to sweet - but we were both able to recover a little bit and finish these last 2 courses.  Le Citron (the lemon) - honey gelee and a light lemon cream finished with a spiced red fruit coulis, yum.  Le Moka, Les Mignardises (the coffee, the small desserts) - Lastly, we were presented with this beautiful cart from which we could take whatever we wanted.  Stuffed to the brim, but a wonderful and beautiful experience!  I would love to return, but considering how full we got and how sick I was that night because of it, I would order differently.  The 16 course is a wonderful way to experience all that they have to offer, but it is just too much (especially with the wine pairing).  Next time, I will order the 6 course menu where I can choose my favorite dishes and still take advantage of the marvelous bread and petit fours cart.  The 6 course menu also includes the cheese cart which the 16 course did not (which made me sad, but there was no way that I would have had room for it anyway).  I have also heard that you can split 1 wine pairing between 2 people, which would be a much more reasonable amount than what we had.",

ATMOSPHERE: It may be located next to Ka and right off the casino floor, but it feels like a world away. Masterful soundproofing and design transports you to someplace quiet and elegant.   FOOD: We opted for the 5-course tasting menu. Every single thing we enjoyed was amazingly prepared and thoughtfully presented. No surprise there, given the culinary chops of the restaurant's namesake and the talented team he created. But, what was surprising were the special little touches - the stuff-of-dreams bread cart, the whimsical selections of tiny desserts.   DRINKS: Also no surprise here - the wine and beverage list offer many fantastic choices. I opted for a French 75 and a half bottle of excellent white wine. (My companion doesn't drink, so I was pleased to have that option.) You will not go thirsty here.  SERVICE: Everyone there made you feel like an honored guest. They also celebrated my husband's birthday in such a lovely way. Service was exceptionally attentive without being cloying. We kept thanking them profusely for everything because we were so thrilled.   I can not wait to return next time we visit.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is in a class by itself and is a True rarity. I can guarantee that you have never been to a legitimately fine restaurant in your life unless you have been here or to one of few in the world that are on par with Joel Robuchon.  I knew that a truly elegant restaurant must exist somewhere in the USA and I finally found it.  The decor and staff of Joel Robuchon is unparalleled and rivals no other in my vast experience. Immaculate-condition interior and quality taste meets with beautiful and cohesive ambience. Eye-catching serviceware is put into action such as the bread cart featuring many fresh varities with house-made butter underglass.   Food is sophisticated and beyond exceptional. All is unique and prepared perfectly. Artistic presentation and attention to detail of cuisine is like no other.  The music selections were wonderful. Brahms piano concertos and the like make for a serene atmoshphere.  Our group had the 17-course menu which is far too extravagant and complex to describe in this review but suffice to say was well worth 445 dollars per person (wine not included) and I highly recommend this menu for a five-hour dining experience. Every course was a surprise in tastes, colors, and textures and visually stunning. The dessert cart was extraordinary featuring dozens of classics as well as unique creations.   The wait service was impeccably dressed and genuinely formal with each course being explained to its finest points.   In conclusion and to provide contrast, it is important to note that much of what makes Joel Robuchon exceptional is that it is devoid of all errors characteristic of virtually all other so-called upscale restaurants. Best to list some of these ubiquitous errors. Joel Robuchon suffers from none of these flaws:  1. Decor/furnishings that are bric-a-brac and/or damaged. 2. Eye-sores like plastic dish buckets and cleaning supplies visible. 3. Food/dirty remnants stuck on walls and furniture and stains all about. 4. Clanking of dishes from busboys and general cacophony.  5. Precooked \"lazy\" foods/glorified leftovers that are made in bulk. 6. Limited ingredients used in permutations for all entrees/apps. 7. Money/labor-saving techniques. 8. Inappropriate/plebeian music. 9. Casual behavior and mannerisms of staff. 10. Boorish diners. 11. Restaurant-supply store goods. 12. Poorly selected/unripe fruit and vegetable parts. 13. Hurried food preparation. 14. Inept service. 15. Dirty/worn menus. 16. Trending menu items.  Like many of us, we have all been to many so-called upscale restaurants but these are flawed in most every respect. I have been long privy to so-called upscale restaurants that are essentially uncaringly run and are cost-cutting, poorly maintained/unclean and riddled with service/etiquette errors not to mention mediocre food quality.   Lastly, I would like to thank Joel Robuchon staff and its superb effort for finally meeting my expectations of a True fine-dining experience that will be remembered for a lifetime.  Far more than five-star rating is merited.",

I'll start off by saying that I've been to two other restaurants by Joel Robuchon and like many others fell in LOVE with his food. First experience being the next door L'Atelier By Joel Robuchon (it's literally next door) and another in Japan. Both were excellent and gave me more reasons to be excited to finally engage in this ultimate fine dining experience!   Service  Must start here because service is simply the best. Despite the restaurant being very high end, the staff were very very friendly and the service feels very personalized. I am especially impressed with the service because we were unable to finish the degustation menu that we got (16-course meal spread out to 6 big courses comprised of various delicacies) and had to give up with our last course remaining (excluding dessert). We just had one too many drinks beforehand :(.  The staff were very understanding of this and even offered to provide a small discount for the last dish we couldn't get to. I thought their response to our disappointing performance was very nice.   Food  Three highlights for me -  bread, Le caviar imperial, and the desserts! With Joel Robuchon's restaurants every plate is a work of art. He'll even make questionable ingredients like frog legs to make it look like a fine piece of art that even tastes good. I'll break down all three of my highlights a bit. This, by the way, isn't to say that all the rest of the course wasn't impressive. I really liked the tomato in the first course, the sea urchin (uni) was freaking fresh... I can go on and on, so you've just got to try it!  Bread- i pretty much spent the whole night wondering how their bread remains so freaking soft and chewy (not the hard, oh I'm going to break my teeth chewy) when they're out in the open the whole time? It really is a shame that you'll probably only be able to try 3-4 pieces at most and the olive oil they serve is just mind blowing!!!!   Le caviar imperial- I LOVE caviar. If I see it on the menu, I'll order it even though I don't like it when it gets served on food as a topping and sometimes those caviars can have very strong odor and be extremely salty. But this dish makes you feel like you're a small fish swimming happily in the Pacific Ocean with a big grin on your face cause you're finally home (if you know what I mean). The presentation of this dish just completes it!! It's covered in jelly-ish thing and I think that really offsets the salty taste if you take in too much caviar at once like a palate cleaner.  Anyway, it's just perfect and there's a reason why this is one of the most famous dishes he was known for.   Desserts- so we gave up on the last course of our 6-course degustation, but we couldn't give up on the dessert. Desserts here is just out of this world. It looks amazing and it tastes even better than it looks (and that's really hard to do). I am oh so very happy about the pound cake and the macaroons they give you as a parting gift cause I'm devouring that as soon as I get home!!!!   Their complimentary bday cake also puts this restaurant in its own league. First, it's an ice cream cake with meringue. When's the last time you had an ice cream cake??? I haven't had one esp for my bday since I was 11. Second, that presentation!! I honestly felt like a royalty. You'll have to see the pix.   PRICE- yes, at $445/pp, you'll easily rack up over $1K for 2 people on the bill. Corkage is $50 (some reviews here says $100, I'm guessing it went down since), so BYO if you plan on drinking (if you order a glass, you'll most likely be paying 45+). Overall, the experience is totally worth it!! I hope to go back :)",

    "text": "The epitome of French fine dining, and exactly what a 3 Michelin Star meal should be. Located within the MGM Grand, the interior is a tranquil, luxurious escape from hectic Las Vegas. Ornate chandeliers, saturated jewel tones, and plush velvet seating create an ambience of timeless elegance. There was even a stool for my purse. Reservations were easy to acquire 2 weeks in advance. Management will reach out to you 3 days prior to your meal to confirm, and note any special requests.  My boyfriend and I came here with friends who are strict vegans, and the staff were incredibly accommodating. Their meal was just as special as ours, with equal substitutes for every course. The menu lists 4 different options to create your own menu, but honestly, you are doing yourself a disservice by not enjoying the full Menu Degustation ($450 per person, or $375 for the vegetarian version). These consist of 17 small dishes, presented over the course of about 3 hours.   From the amuse bouche to the concluding confections, everything we consumed was astoundingly good. I was in awe of the bread cart, from which I enjoyed saffron brioche, fluffy milk bread, a gruyere puff, and even a mini croissant with their salted, creamy imported French butter. My favorite dish overall was the Green Asparagus Veloute on scallion jam with ricotta tortellini pasta. The rich, vegetable spiced sauce enrobed every bite of the delicate, pillowy pasta, leaving lingering earthy undertones on the palate.   The dessert courses were as beautiful as they were delicious, and varied with one fruit-forward course (served atop a sake gelee!) and then a chocolate/coffee fondant. Just when I thought I could not possibly eat anything else, the dessert cart arrived, whimsically displaying dozens of bite sized treats-truffles, canele, macarons, and petit fours galore. Somehow, I managed to sample 8 selections.   Service was polished and professional, with a genuine tact that was much appreciated by myself and company. At the conclusion of the meal, we were gifted a lemon pound cake to take home, which we enjoyed with coffee all week. Like everything at Joel Robuchon, it was perfection, and kept the dining experience fresh in our thoughts. This ranks among the best meals of my life, and I look forward to returning.",

    "text": "My brother Andrew C. turned 30 last month, and to celebrate, Matt B. and I treated him and Celestine H. to a blowout dinner at Joel Robuchon. I was able to book a 10:00 Saturday night table just over a week in advance. I requested an earlier time if possible and was pleased when a 9:00 seating opened up the day of our reservation.  The restaurant was beautiful, so sumptuous and peaceful, it was almost hard to believe the MGM casino was right outside the door. We dressed up, adhering to the dress code (there was one man in the dining room dressed in shorts, and he looked like an asshole). Joel Robuchon was fancy, and the extravagant grandeur was a lot of the fun.  Service was impeccable, attentive and delightfully formal, with staff in spotless uniforms lifting cloches from elegant plates. There was a whole team of people taking care of us, and they were all polite and mega-competent. I don't think we ever needed to ask for anything, except for a few photos at the end of the meal.  We were seated right when we arrived, then presented with menus and a welcome bite. We enjoyed tiny, crispy quinoa croquettes as we pondered our options, ordering a round of cocktails before deciding on food and wine. These were unnecessary--$22 a pop for mostly standard nice cocktails--but definitely enjoyable. I got the Mr. Robuchon Gin & Tonic, and this was easily the best one, a refreshing G & T with house-infused Botanist dry gin, Fever Tree tonic, and Scrappy's lime bitters. The others were good, too. The Corpse Reviver No. 2 was made with Monkey 47 gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, lemon juice, and absinthe drop; the Hemingway Papa Doble with Diplomatico Planas rum, Luxardo Maraschino, grapefruit juice, and lime juice; the Ward Eight with Eagle Rare bourbon, lemon, grapefruit juice, and Jack Rudy grenadine.  Joel Robuchon offers a number of menu options, ranging from $127 for a main course and dessert with an amuse bouche and mignardises to $445 for an enormous tasting menu. We went for the $198 menu, which fell in the middle, with two appetizers on top of the entry-level selection. We also ordered a wine pairing--there were tiers here, too, and we picked the lowest one, which was still almost $200 a head. This was worth it, though, for a super special birthday dinner. The wines were great and the pours heavy, and the thoughtful pairings added a lot to the meal, and to its sense of occasion.  The food was exquisite. I couldn't believe that fucking bread cart. There were like twenty kinds of bread, and we could have any of them we wanted, with hand-churned Normandie butter and some terrific olive oil. I tried the mini-baguette, the saffron focaccia, the rosemary brioche, and breads with gruyere, bacon, comte, and milk. All superb.  The amuse bouche was a fantastic cherry tomato gazpacho, tangy and cool, with balsamic reduction, pistachio, and a dollop of ricotta sorbet. For my first appetizer, I got the Maine lobster, which came in little faux ravioli, sweet lobster meat tucked between thin slices of turnip, finished with radish and a sweet and sour dressing. Next, I had the green asparagus veloute, a delicious silky green soup poured over peas, ricotta tortellini, and scallion jam. I also sneaked a bite of Matt's seared duck foie gras with confit peppers and acidic tomato glaze, which cost an extra $25. It was, of course, excellent.  Matt and I shared our entrees, and there was a clear winner here. The black cod was amazing, caramelized and buttery, served on a black garlic puree with shiso and lemongrass emulsion. The grilled beef ribeye, though, was surprisingly mediocre, definitely the weakest dish of the night. It just wasn't very tender or flavorful, though I liked the crispy gyoza of foie gras and celeriac accompaniments.  We shared all our desserts and made one of them a cheese plate, mostly because we saw the cheese cart going around (maybe this makes us simple, but we were very impressed with all the carts). There were a dozen cheeses on that thing, and we asked for a varied selection. We got the Brillat-Savarin, the Pont l'Eveque, the comte, the Crottin de Chavignol, and the Roquefort, and they were all lovely.  Then we had lots of sugar. The bitter chocolate souffle was the highlight here, airy and warm, served with vanilla ice cream. I also enjoyed La Sphere, a gorgeous sugar bubble filled with blueberry yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. Le Papillon Chocolat Azelia was a sweet terrarium of hazelnut milk chocolate cremeux with coffee chantilly and praline ice cream.  Dinner ended with one last cart, exploding with mignardises. I tried a pineapple coconut lollipop, a chocolate-covered orange peel, a strawberry tart, a raspberry tart, a banana eclair, a religieuse eclair, a canele, a kaffir lime chocolate, and a panna cotta, all tiny, sweet delights. As a parting gift, we received whole loaves of lemon pound cake. This was wonderful and over the top, a fitting way to end this phenomenal, decadent meal.",

    "text": "I have always wanted to try Joel Robuchon because it's one of those restaurants that had gotten a 3 Michelin Stars. So, my fiancee surprised me for our anniversary dinner.   I don't believe JR has the 3 Michelin stars anymore, so don't get your expectation hyped up. The food here is great, but it's not like blown my mind away great. Maybe it's just the fact that I'm not a French food type of girl. The bread here though, I gotta tell ya, it's from another world. If you love bread or even if you don't (I normally don't eat bread), make sure you try as many pieces at you can.   They do give you a selection of 2, 3 or 4 course meal with or without the petite desserts. If I were to do it all over again, I would choose the 3 course meal (including the dessert) instead of the 4 course meal.  Another reason you don't want to choose too many courses (or one without the dessert) is that their dessert is the bomb!  You can actually choose \"all\" of the petite dessert and they'll course it out for you. Boy, I wish I had the stomach to do that.   Oh, don't forget to try their butter that is imported from France. It's one of the richest, fattiest and most flavorful butter I've ever tasted (and I'm not a butter person).  The olive oil they have is also out of this world.  I was actually told you can buy a bottle from Amazon, which my fiancee did right away.    Tip: Make reservation early if you can; otherwise, you'll get a late night seating, which will ruin your stomach for the desserts.",

Most courses were served with up to three dishes on the plate, most of which were tasting dishes: one to two bites each. The flow of the meal was slightly problematic though. At the beginning of the meal, we ended up  waiting around twenty minutes for the first couple of courses, which personally, felt too long. However the sequence of dishes was perfect. At the end of the meal I didn't feel stuffed, but full enough, not needing to eat more. The food was rich, but not too rich. The service was generally very good, keeping water filled at the beginning of service, although towards the middle and end of service, they struggled to keep glasses full. If this was some ordinary restaurant it would've had 5 stars, but for its price and status, I thought it could've been a little bit better.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Joel Robuchon... I am VERY torn between giving this a four star or a five star. Most of my complaints are a bit nit picky at this point. So, first off, the atmosphere was wonderful. Inside is beautiful and My boyfriend and I got to sit in a little indoor area that was made to look like an outdoor patio. My boyfriend and I opted for the 17 or 18 course tasting menu since we rarely come to Vegas.   Right off the bat, we were served bread from an amazing bread cart. Words cannot describe how AMAZING the bread it. I honestly could just eat the breads for a meal. I got very basic breads (baby baguette, baby croissant, and baby milk bread) and they were great. My boyfriend got more adventurous breads (like the saffron bread) and he loved it too. Now, onto the dishes. The dishes were amazingly creative. Much more creative than most Michelin restaurants in the Bay Area. There was a tomato with gazpacho IN THE tomato... also the tomato was so fresh like summertime... taste like those farmer's market tomato and not the supermarket ones. There was also a corn soup with marshmallow that was very memorable. The ribeye there was also one of the best I ever had. It had the flavor of ribeye but the texture of a filet minion. I will say that they give you TONS of food when you order the full blown tasting menu.   The reason why I am a bit torn about the restaurant is because there were certain dishes that I did not feel were balanced.  There was this asparagus soup that was so delicious but had little bits of orange peel that were very bitter. The uni also tasted over seasoned and not clean and fresh. I prefer everything to be well balanced.  I know my boyfriend thought I was being nit picky.  Also, the service was a bit cold and not memorable. Comparing this place with Guy Savoy (which was much cheaper and probably almost as good if not just as good) I would choose Guy Savoy.   Nevertheless, I still give this place 5 stars because, in the end, it is very innovative and the experience was great. If you have the money to spend I would definitely say try this place. I plan to try all the other Joel Robuchons around the world!",

They won't seat you until it's actually the time of the reservation.  The service was superb and just as we expected. Kit and Anthony were very accommodating. There are several menus to choose from. We tried the 5-course menu which is $250 per person. It comes with two appetizers, two entrees, and one dessert, which I think is more than enough food. I was getting full once I got my first entree. For starters, you also get a variety of unlimited bread, which, although yummy, I recommend you don't eat much of. My favorites were the L'uf de Poule Miroir (egg on top of hash brown with Ibarra bacon and truffle) and the Le Buf (two small pieces of ribeye with two pieces of macaroni filled meat).  Can't wait to go back and try the rest!",

This is our first 3 Michelin Star Restaurant and it was definitely worth it.    Service: The receptionist checked our coats in and the waiter takes us to our seat.   The waiters were very professional, explained every dish we ordered, and they serve us bread from the bread cart.  They even scooped the butter I accidentally dropped on the table.    Food: There are different price ranges when ordering a 3 course meal.  We went with 2 menu A which cost $250 each.  This comes with 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert.  There are some dishes that will cost extra, but it is totally worth it in my opinion.  The bread cart and the dessert cart are complimentary that makes the experience even better.    Overall: This is definitely an amazing experience.  It is definitely pretty pricey, however it is something I feel everyone should try!",

    "text": "What an experience!  This is by far the most expensive meal I've had but it was worth every penny.  The attention to detail in every presentation/interaction with the staff was amazing.    There are a few different tasting menus to try.  Basically you can choose how many courses you'd like.  Then, from an adjacent list, you choose which apps, entrees and deserts you'd like.  Some choices come with a \"supplement\" meaning add on $XX.xx amount of money depending on the dish.  I opted for the $198 menu which came with 2 appetizers, a main course, a desert and a sweet.   For my two appetizers I chose the lobster and asparagus soup.  One word: perfect.  So much flavor packed into such a tiny portion.  It was unbelievable.  For my entree I chose the veal stuffed with ham and cheese.  Again, perfect.  The server added a small helping of mashed potatoes to each of our dishes.  I have NEVER had mashed potatoes whipped so finely.  The texture was insane (in a good way).   Now desert was a spectacle in it's own right.  I chose the chocolate souffle which came with a $10 supplement.  So worth it!  Tbh, not very flattering in pics like most of their deserts, but what it lacked in visual appeal it made up for in flavor.  Wow!  Once desert was finished, they brought around a desert cart with small bite sized tarts, truffles and macarons.  So yummy!  Once we finished those, they brought around ANOTHER sweet.  This was a combination of a mini creme brulee and a blackberry ricotta yogurt thing?  So amazing.   This is an experience!  This is something everyone should do at least once.  Thank you for a perfect dinner, I'll be talking about this place for the rest of my life.",

We were seated in a nice table and were given kind assistance from the waiters. we ordered the 18-Course Tasting Menu at Joel Robuchon. I was not eating food, I was eating art. Each piece was carefully planned and crafted with the most fresh ingredients from the best sources around the world. All the seafood and meats were so smooth and perfectly cooked, the veggies were properly sauteed, and the sauces were perfectly painted on the plates. I do not have a favorite because each were so different, delicious and balanced.",

    "text": "The billing as a 3-star Michelin restaurant is definitely warranted. It has all the bells and whistles that any other 3-star restaurant has including atmosphere, menu, and service. The location doesn't fit the expectation of a restaurant of this ilk as it sits within the aging MGM Grant Hotel & Casino. That said, once you enter the restaurant itself, the transformation into a decadent location happens. The service we experienced was superb from the hostess to the Maitre D was very nice. The room was light and airy and surprising was half empty on a late Friday night. Both the menu and wine listing were extensive and offered something for everyone. But anyone booking a reservation here shouldn't expect sticker shock at $1,000 bottles of wine and $22-$75 glasses of wine. The menu as to be expected at most french 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants indeed pricey and offered both tasting menu's in 4, 5, 6 and even 15-course offerings. I wanted to try the 15 courses but we had a show in 2 hours and felt the time was against me. Instead, we tried the 5-coursee menu. The courses, in short, were spectacular. At this price point your expecting that, but the food was beyond the beyond. The first course was a corn-based gazpacho with tiny bits of prosciutto and cream. It tasted like heaven in a bowl. Soft, creamy and with a balance of salt made you instantly want more. And in True French fashion, they serve just enough for you to understand what your tasting, but not enough that you don't want more.  The bread cart that followed the 1st course was something out of a bakery. A cart filled with at least 10 different types of fresh-baked bread. The star we tasted was a buttered bread that tasted warm and chewy with no need for butter or olive oil. Speaking of which, the waiter paired the cart of pieces of bread with a separate tray of carved butter from a tower of house-made butter that looked amazing.  The next few courses were also as good as the first. foie gras pan-seared with artichoke and pistachio cream. One of the other standouts was the Wahoo fish dish that sort of melted in your mouth. The dish didn't disappoint from the waiter's high recommendation. The dessert tray was amazing even for a french restaurant so many choices but let me end this review with this. We ordered the chocolate souffle. Of course it was homemade and of course, it was the best thing I have ever tasted for dessert, like ever. It came with two different sauces to choose from. I don't remember the sauces as they were an afterthought of the souffle. The Chef came out to say hi, which is always nice. But as a foodie, I wanted to marry him and divorce my wife for guaranteed meals like this for the rest of my life ;).  Adventures and meals like this are truly once in a lifetime. For me the experience of it all is worth the $$. Meals like this stay with you past digestion. I highly recommend this stupendous restaurant and hope you enjoy it as much as we did. Thank You Paul Robuchon.",

    "text": "The eponymous Joel Robuchon restaurant is the only restaurant in Las Vegas boasting 3 Michelin stars, and they are well deserved!  Even New Yorkers have to settle for a mere 1-star Atelier which is not the same.   As such, this restaurant is worth a trip out west.    I opted not for the full degustation menu, but rather the next largest choice, the 6 course prix fixe meal.  It turned out to be an exceptionally good meal with very attentive service and an especially knowledgeable sommelier.   Bread Course:  An odd start, but the selection was extensive.  I liked their cheese brioche, and the option of Normandy butter served on a cold slate was just lovely.    Amuse Bouche: Ossetra caviar served over fresh crab with a cream sauce.  I was confused when this was brought to me, as I thought this belonged to the Degustation menu.  But, no, in Joel Robuchon's world, caviar works as an amuse bouche.  How decadent!  I was so enthused by this most auspicious of beginnings.   Appetizer:  Noix de Saint Jacques:  Sea scallop a la plancha with a sauce of kumquat and caviar.  More caviar!  Perfectly seared scallops and beautifully presented.  All of the flavors were in balance -- an excellent course.  Soup:  Le Soja:  Cappuccino of soy bean on a shimeji royal.  The description does not sound very appetizing, and the presentation is only marginally better.  Nonetheless, this is an amazing soup.  So earthy, and the flavor was so robust.  The mushrooms were delicious, and I was really impressed by just how good this dish was.  A True chef can be measured by the quality of his soup -- bravo!  Seafood course:  Langouste:  Spiny lobster in a sake broth, turnip and shiso sprouts.  They actually present this with the spiny lobster shell which they immediately take away, unveiling the dish underneath.  The sake broth was quite delectable and well flavored by the addition of the turnips and sprouts.  Unfortunately,  I was rather disappointed with the langouste itself, a house specialty no less.  I was unable to glean any flavor from it, and the texture was slightly chalky.  This was far short of the langouste I had at Per Se a few months ago, for example.  A strange miss in an otherwise incredible meal.  Meat course:  Canard:  Duck and seared foie gras in a cherry sauce and fresh almonds.  The duck was especially good.  The foie gras was not.  It was too fatty, in a way that is not good.  But the duck was so good, I would just as happily do without the foie gras.  Cheese course:  Another extensive selection that would stump all but the most ardent of turophiles.  I made pedestrian choices like Camembert and Roquefort.  But I also tried some new cheeses like Langres, which apparently I do not like.  All of the selections were fresh, served at the appropriate temperature, and of very high quality.  It was a great way to finish my red wine, and cleanse my palate before having dessert.    Le Chocolat:  Melting Araguani chocolate refreshed with a hint of peppermint.  Exquisitely presented on its own pedestal, this is an extraordinary dessert.    Complimentary dessert: Vanilla ice cream served on a crisp.  Very good ice cream with good quality vanilla bean, likely of the Madagascar variety.    Mignardises:  I thought the bread trolley and the cheese trolley were large, but I clearly had not seen the dessert trolley.  It must have taken about 10 minutes to review all of the possible selections.  Gold leaf was liberally used, and I was happy to see more exotic selections like banana filled chocolates.  Takeaway bag:  pistachio cake.  I am still eating this.  It is a wonderful keepsake to make the amazing experience last a little bit longer, and it is good too.    Highly recommend.

    "text": "General Fine-Dining Disclaimer: Many people do not understand that most (if not all) upscale restaurants do not pile a ton of food on your plate. A diner should appreciate the finest flavors orchestrated into smaller dishes, which is how we received our servings. If you're looking for places that serve up large piles of food and multiple napkins, kindly skip my reviews.  --  I wanted my GF to experience a Michelin 3-star restaurant. I had no idea about the level of sophistication that a restaurant can give, but I do now.  Tip: If you are planning to use the complimentary MGM limo, make sure to reserve it way in advance. We were brought to the MGM via the VIP Mansion entrance, and walked through the exclusive area that most people don't get to see.  Note: Guys, if your GF is the jealous type, avoid eye contact with the Asian hostess dressed in Robuchon garb. Trust me.  The GF had the six-course selection and I had the 16-course Menu Degustation tasting menu. If you ever want to feel proud in a restaurant, tell the Maitre'd that you'll be ordering the Menu Degustation selection and he'll give you an approving nod with a \"Ah. Very good, sir.\"  The GF had a serving of Robuchon's legendary whipped potatoes, and asked to have a little more that was still left in the bowl. I explained that we'd heard of the potatoes and the waiter graciously explained the process and scrutiny that is placed on it. He later came back with an extra serving of complimentary whipped potatoes for the GF... I wasn't as lucky, but she was happy.  If you're female, the restaurant gives you a gift in their chic black bag. The GF got a very-rich pineapple pound cake and a personal menu listing the items from the Menu Degustation selection. I got the check.  After-dinner kitchen tour: The same hostess took us through the main kitchen as well as the separate pastry kitchen areas. She explained a lot of background info and showed us the numerous awards that the restaurant received over the years. Of note, Restaurant Joel Robuchon has its own dedicated kitchens which are separate from L'Atelier de Robuchon. We also got to see Robuchon's Michelin 3-Star plaque and I video'd everything on my shaky iPhone.   - Food: Excellent. The best French cuisine I've ever had. If you order the Menu Degustation, expect to stay 3-4 hours. I've been in French bistro's and higher-end restaurants, but Joel Robuchon trumped them all.  - Service: Excellent. The little things impressed me. When my GF asked what brand of Olive Oil they used (Masia El Altet), the Maitre'd brought her the label that hangs from the bottle. They have dedicated wait staff watching you for any need you might have.  - Pros: Food. Service. Ambiance. After-dinner kitchen tour. Uh... everything.  - Cons (not really): Price - I have never spent this much on any form of food in my life. Our trip was in Sept. and I'm still paying this off on my credit card. But you get what you pay for, and we got the best French fare (Michelin 3-star).  Is this restaurant for everyone? No. But it was an experience I was glad to have (and pay for). I can't say that we'll be eating there when we return to LV in a couple of weeks, but we were very happy to have had this experience. Hopefully we'll get to go there again.",

    "text": "A M A Z ZZZZZZZZINNNNGGGGG! (yes exclamatory on the ZINNNNNNNGG! with a high pitch sound!)  Went here for my girlfriends once a year treat and bday. I decided I had heard enough about this place and I wanted to experience it for myself. We walked over from Cosmo not knowing they had the gold limo experience...but oh well I was in it for the food!  This place is just off the top bliss, its very intimate from the minute you walk into the bar. They had us wait in the bar, and they had GOOD top shelf alcohol here. I had a Macallan 25 to start of my night...and that set it off realllll smooth. You do sit next to people but I know I was more than two people lengths from the seating next to us on either side. Some people are just loud in general, but for the most part me and my girlfriend did not have to raise our voices to have a conversation, in fact if I dropped my fork I can guarantee that everyone in the restaraunt would hear it.   Service was awesome, I think it was at least two individuals maybe three per person in our party that were whisking away dishes or refilling our glasses with wine or water.  My SO and I did the 4 course prixe fixe and it was well worth it. The Amouse Bouch or whatever you call it, was a jelly in a special vase suspended over dry ice. Man the presentation of that blew me out of the water...  From there on it was like I was in food heaven. The bread cart.. Its the size of my smart car. CRAPOLA! I went crazy on the bread realizing I havent even started my meal. They had special butter from the UK and then a olive oil from the South of Spain.  See I was so fixated on the carts...that I completely forgot what I ordered...ok now I remember..  1) Crispy soft boiled egg with smoked salmon and caviar 2) Delicate tofu veloute with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelee, smoked and caramelized eel 3) Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds 4) Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam  The Duck was the standout dish... I love foie gras, but the way this melted in my mouth..oh man...  The couple next to us had the 16 course with wine, and they looked stuffed! I will only hope that I can go back and try this once in my lifetime, in the meantime, I can say I did experience a restaraunt that was to die for!",

    "text": "I've been dreaming of trying this place for two years since I've been to L'Atelier multiple times on recent trips out here.  Everything from the start of the evening to the end was very well organized with friendly people and knowledgeable servers. If you'd like to dine here, I'd encourage you to take advantage of their complimentary limo service that will pick you up anywhere on the strip and also drop you off anywhere on the strip when your meal is complete. The limo has complimentary fiji h20 as well as newspaper for your enjoyment (although the ride there is rather quick!)  The limo pulls through the MGM Mansion which is a secluded area that the general public cannot enter. It was ultimate luxury and I felt like we were in a humongous villa in Lago di Como in Italy or something. Upon your arrival at the mansion, you'll be escorted to the restaurant by Joel Robuchon staff.  Joel Robuchon was very glam and very Vegas. Although it was luxurious, I felt that it was a lot more showy and a lot more sparkly than typical Michelin-rated restaurants. Although..I guess they had to add this touch for a Vegas 3-star Michelin restaurant to give it character.  You're first introduced to the bread cart which are made in house. I definitely recommend grabbing a couple of different ones as they're all rich in flavors and also super soft & moist! Their super soft butter also pairs great with their breads.  As for the meal, I started with the caviar, then had the salmon tartar, then the chestnut & foie gras soup, and for my main dish - the duck & foie gras with potato puree. Finally, I went with the orange dessert and loved it. Each dish was exquisite and was presented in the most artful manner. I felt that presentation here was at least half if not more the reason to go here.  Finally, we ended with coffee & tea which is included and they bring a chocolate cart that they allow you to choose a couple yummy bites from.  Although the food was phenomenal, I have to say that they weren't as accommodating as French Laundry. While all French Laundry's non-alcoholic beverages are included in the price (as well as gratuity) - here, water is a whopping $10/bottle and gratuity is not included. Furthermore, you are limited to only 5 chocolates at the end of your meal - and they were mediocre at best - pretty to look at, but I have to admit that I've tasted better.  If I were to compare French Laundry to Joel Robuchon in terms of food, presentation, and service (since they are both the only 3 Michelin star rated restaurants of the West Coast) I would say that French Laundry is more warm, elegant, and has better variation of flavors, whereas Joel is more glam, shiny, and has \"prettier\" presentation.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and without a doubt would not hesitate to come again!",

    "text": "I had originally posted a review where i berated everything here from the service to the food. It got removed by the owner/Yelp. So I will summarize my review. Food is good, same as any high end French restaurant in a metropolitan area. Price are insane because its Vegas. Waiters hovered over you wayyyyy too much. Atmosphere is extremely stuffy and pretentious, makes it hard to have a casual conversation. Look, if I'm paying 1000 bucks for dinner for two, I should be able to do whatever I want. An example of the hovering is when I passed over a bite of food to my girlfriend and the waiter rushed over and asked if there was a problem with an extremely disapproving look on his face. I guess sharing food is looked down upon here? Like I understand that you are trying to cultivate a cultured dining experience but this is America, where we eat big macs and share fries and shakes with our friends, don't make me feel uncomfortable while I'm trying to share a nice dinner with my significant other.",

This 3-stars Michelin is the best restaurant I've been to. I ate at the Mansion.  Atmosphere 5/5: Chic and Classy. The place is small enough to gather the right amount of people to create a perfect ambiance. Colours are wisely chosen and the place is great for a romantic dinner. Dinner 5/5: You will enjoy this 5-star Gourmet meal from the Amuses-Bouche to the Desserts. I had \"La Sole\" which was one of the tastiest fish I had for a long time. As appetizer, we had the Foie Gras Soup. As dessert, we had the Chocolate Souffle which was out of this world! Service 5/5: P.E.R.F.E.C.T !  Such a small review but there's not a lot to say about it... It's just amazing and it's an experience you have to try by yourself.",

    "text": "First of all, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  No, no.   I don't even know where to start.  I had really been looking forward to eating at Joel Robuchon since we booked our trip to Vegas a few months ago.  Last year we enjoyed a lovely dinner at Sage (at the Aria), and I was hoping we could top that experience by dining at the \"best\" restaurant in Las Vegas.   I must say the atmosphere and service were good.  However, now that the evening is over, that is the only positive thing I can say about Joel Robuchon.  As soon as we were seated, we were offered an aperitif (we had not even been given a wine or cocktail list.)  We said yes, but were horrified when we received the bill and had been charged 90 dollars for two glasses of champagne.  I have now read prior reviews complaining of the same thing, and I wish I had done so prior to our dinner.  It is not the cost of the drink (as I have ordered myself such a glass before), it is the fact that I felt as though they were trying to keep it from us.  Of all the fine dining I have done, this has never been a situation I have been in.  We were then asked if we would like sparkling or still water (in which we chose still) and were again shocked with a 30 dollar charge for freaking WATER!  I know Vegas is running short on water, but I mean, come on people!    The food was good, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I have had the pleasure of eating at some of the finest restaurants in the country (Alinea, Le Bernardin, etc.) and have NEVER regretted a moment of those experiences.  I literally slept like crap last night running over and over in my mind how I felt we had been totally SCAMMED.  I have no problem paying 400 dollars pp for a meal, but I would have a problem paying even just 30 dollars when I feel like I have been cheated, as I felt at Joel Robuchon.  Truthfully, it just seems sleezy to me and a bit desperate. Please, heed my advice and avoid this restaurant.  If you are truly interested in mind blowing food, this is not the restaurant for you.  If you are interested in saying you ate at one of the most expensive restaurants in the country and don't care about the food or being taken advantage of, knock yourself out.",

    "text": "This was my first fine dining experience, and it lived up to my expectations. The decor is luxurious; the waiters were helpful and pleasant; and every morsel of food was packed with complex flavors.   As many reviewers have pointed out, don't be shy with the bread cart. You're paying good money for this meal, so go for it! I chose five breads, and each one was memorable. My favorite was the gruyere brioche, because it was delicate and flaky but had a pronounced cheese flavor.  As for the amuse bouche, it is crab mixture topped with caviar. This was my first bit of caviar, and I wasn't too thrilled with it, but I can't blame Joel for that because it's a matter of taste. If you know that you don't like caviar, I recommend that you ask for an alternate amuse bouche. My boyfriend is allergic to seafood, so he asked for an alternate when we were ordering. The waiter was very understanding and produced a cold beat soup. I know beet soup doesn't sound appetizing, but it was delicious.   I order le sole for my main dish, and I was very pleased. The sauce was silky and savory. My boyfriend order some sort of red meat dish. He didn't seem to be crazy about the meat, but he really liked the accompanying vegetables, which says a lot because he doesn't eat a lot of vegetables.    My desert, le chocolat, was divine. I adore ice cream, and the coffee ice cream was the best that I've ever eaten. The dish also had melted chocolate and fresh whipped cream, which made every bite different.   Just like the bread cart, don't be shy with the desert cart. I chose five different desert morsels. I recommend the five spice chocolate and the strawberry cheesecake with liquor. The five spice chocolate tasted like the love child of a pumpkin pie and a chocolate truffle. The cheesecake was a wonderful surprise, because it appears to be a firm ball when you hold it, but it almost explodes in your mouth. You could say it was a flavor explosion.   This review was much longer than I intended, but I couldn't stop typing. That's how much I loved Joel.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work. He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.    Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful. A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful. Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine. The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment \"I think you'll find these more in your.. price range\"  record scratch.  uhm, excuse me?! Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways. We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.  Then came time for dessert. During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon. I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us. Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..  Overall the food itself was really really spectacular. The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite. However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing. We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.",

    "text": "Not sure what else I can add, but I will say that Joel Robuchon was one of my top two dining experiences of the year (along with Momofuku Ko). The two are very different: Joel Robuchon is like the platonic ideal of French style fine dining. Everything that other Michelin star French places do, they do bigger and better.   For example, many restaurants have great bread. Most Michelin starred restaurants will even offer a selection of bread. I have a weakness for carbs that makes me hate myself in the morning, so I've had embarrassing amounts of tasty bread from Bouchon, Jean George and the like. Most of these places will even offer a nice selection of bread, perhaps on a tray. At Joel Robuchon, they wheel a cart the size of a motorcycle over, full of bread. It literally looks like something that would be served to a king in a Disney movie. The same thing happens after dinner with their \"mignardes cart,\" which is the same thing but... covered in mostly chocolate dessert items.   Of course, the food was amazing and also very consistent. One would hope that when paying upwards of $500 for two this would be a given, but even places like Jean George or Manresa had courses that just didn't work for me. Not so at Joel Robuchon, where everything was fantastic.   Then, at the end of the night, they send you home with a loaf of fresh baked lemon bread, which was a tasty breakfast the next day.   It's been a pretty good year for me, and I've been lucky enough to dine at a number of fantastic restaurants, but in terms of pure, decadent, gluttonous fine dining experience, Joel Robuchon stands above the rest.",

My husband and I decided to live life dangerously so we both tried the 16 course tasting menu. With a price tag of $400+/person, this decision was not made lightly. We didn't even review what was included in the menu- we just wanted to be surprised and delighted. And surprised and delighted we were!!  Each dish was elegantly masterfully crafted and created to please the palate and the senses. Puree of this, shaving of that, foam of this, with reduction of that... all combined perfectly to create a beautiful symphony of a meal. Not just saying that to justify to huge expense, but my husband and I really did enjoy every bite.... but if you don't dare try the 16 course taster, they are 6 courses and 3 course options + a la carte which doesn't put such a huge dent in your wallet.... Plus, did I mention the Bread cart??? How about the dessert cart??? Amazing. Put those bad boys in park by my table and we'll be just fine :)",

I had HIGH expectations prior to dinning here, but after our experience.. it was a total disappointment.    I was overwhelmed with the menu,and the servers didnt bother helping us. Since FOIE GRAS wasnt on the menu other than on the tasting menu, that's what we both decided to go with, the 16 course tasting menu.  It started off great, as our first dish, we had the caviar surprise mixed with 3 different crabs.  Everything went down hill there and on..so disappointing?! Our lobster was over poached... mind you, we have lobster at home pretty often, so u cant fool us :p The chef should know how to poach lobster to it's perfection if we can! My boyfriend and i LOVE LOVE LOVE foie gras, but guess what? They over-cooked it. I must say the worst dish we had was the asparagus dish, that thing tasted like chinese herbal medicine. eeh hella gross...    I think by the 6th dish, I literally stopped eating, i really couldnt eat ne more...i would have threw up if i ate n e more. But i did eat some of the desserts... still cant beat Gary Danko's Dessert in my opinon! $1000 was so not worth it here.... I could have eaten at The Dinning Room twice and the food was soooo much better there!  1 star because service was pretty good aside from what i had mentioned aboved another star, their dessert cart candies were delicious!! :)",

The restaurant also sends a complimentary limousine which drives through a secret route to a mansion on the grounds of the MGM hotel. We were escorted by three different people just to get to our table from a back entrance. We never had to walk through the casino.      My husband and I were seated on their terrace which was romantic and lit by candlelight. I ordered the six courses and my husband had ordered the 16 course tasting. Six courses was way too much for me and by the time the cheese cart came I was too stuffed. The bread and the mignardise cart were the best part of my experience. The cocktails were unique and tasty.     Our service was nearly perfect besides them not refilling our water at times. My husband and I enjoyed our amazing meal that evening. The food amazing classic french. I don't need to ramble on in detail about the food because it's Joel Robuchon!

    "text": "Maybe French just isn't for me. We got the 16 course tasting menu, and since we had a rather large group, were placed in the small room to the side - the service was impeccable, if a bit formal (it was hard to get them to join in on our jokes or crack a smile when we directed them at the waiters),  half of the courses were mindblowing and the other half were meh, and my sea bass was overcooked.   At the same time though, when it was good, it was amazing. I loved the foie gras salad, the caviar, which was served with yellowtail carpaccio, salmon tartare,  breads (bacon bread!), mushroom preparation, and pumpkin veloute, but the amuse bouche of green apple/grapefruit was probably one of the more off things I've ever tasted and everything else started blending into a mass of creamy dishes in my head and tongue. Which is sad, because if you have stuff like veal, lobster, and seared scallop at a 3-michelin star restaurant, hopefully they would be more memorable. The desserts were okay, I preferred the ganache to the coffee cake, and luckily since I'm a girl, I got chocolates for the next day in a gift bag when we left :)  I can't complain though, dinner was comped for me. (Thanks!) I don't know if it would have been worth the money normally, as I enjoyed our dinner at Central Michel Richard the next night far more, but there were dishes that were very, very memorable at Joel Robuchon, and bites of those were almost transcendental.",

I will have to settle for someplace else.   In short, this is one of my all-time favorite dining experiences. Everything from the service to the food is unparalleled. All the five star reviews here really don't do the place justice. The last time I ate at Robuchon was close to five years ago, and I can't really even remember what I ate exactly, but I do remember it to be one of the best meals of my life. That's saying something for a guy who loves to eat well.   If you can get in here, it's very much worth it. You'll be paying for it, but you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "If you're looking to dine Vegas style, Joel Robuchon is the place to be.  We came here with 10 friends on the night before New Years Eve. While it's not the most adventurous meal of my life, it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio, osetra caviar, foie gras, duck, Santa Barbara uni, etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  It is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. What more could you ask for? More Caviar? Well, you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous I've seen! Bonus points for them there.   I could describe the food, but if you're a foodie like me, you already know the drill -- The food is good so I will not describe every dish. You get everything that is absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  And the ambiance, while some may say is gaudy, is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. The walled garden in one room, a beautiful welcoming bar in another, etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and Joel Robuchon's attention to detail.  However, a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange:  1) One of the things I found tacky was the $15 water charge.  If you're charging over $800/person for the meal plus pairing, water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. I see this as a terrible faux pas, especially for a three michelin star restaurant. 2) Someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. This would be OK but out of the three times I got up to use the restroom, I only found my napkin folded twice. 3) Joel Robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during \"the holidays\" much to our large party's dismay. It would've been nice to know this when we booked our table. 4) The soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. It was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things. 5) The wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time, etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.  The menu was about $600/person, and my boyfriend and I split the most basic wine pairing for $250. At that price point, it better be perfect. And it was. But perfection comes with a downside -- it's that I think Joel Robuchon played it very safe. If you're a hardcore foodie, I think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try e by Jose Andres).  But if you're here for the Vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance, this is the place to go. Highly recommend. Definitely more of a 4.5 stars from me.",

    "text": "I'm going to keep this simple because most yelpers covered a lot of ground already.  First off, there was mention about the limo ride and wonderful walk through the MGM Mansion.  I would definitely recommend you opt for this just to experience the gorgeous and forbidden secret world of the MGM- it was such a delightful sight!  This will probably be your only opportunity to ever see this area.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, my BF and I were seated at a very romantic and intimate corner of the restaurant.  The decor of this place is really breathtaking and I was in awe with the different color contrasts that they chose to highlight every single feature in the room.  It really complimented the color of flowers they had blossoming everywhere, as well as the plate settings throughout.  Joel Robuchon pays attention to detail and it's definitely reflected throughout  your experience, covering every aspect of your senses.  I had the 16 coursed meal.  This is going to take some time because there are a lot of things that come out, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  Each dish that was placed in front of me was like a piece of art for me to swallow up and take in.  The food had a lot of interesting flavors with unusual ingredients, but it worked.  I believe they recently changed the menu I had so it'd be pointless for me to go through each dish.  Just know that the price of the 16 coursed meal is like an admission to an art museum.  You're not only paying for food, but also an aesthetic detailed manipulation of something with such ordinary significance.  The craftsmanship of the chefs are really reflected on each dish presented.  Overall, Robuchon is definitely worth experiencing at least once in a lifetime.  Service is on point and also pays attention to every single detail of a guest's whole dining experience.  The bread, dessert, and cheese carts were beautifully put together and offered a wonderful selection.  Would I go back?!  Sure will!  Robuchon is a 5 and much deserved because everything about this place is beautiful -and who doesn't like looking at beautiful things??  Moreover, they made me feel like I belonged, even if I really didn't. Love.",

It is extremely elegant so don't bother trying to go in a bathing suit or a cut off. The noise volume is very low and would say is most certainly not geared towards a rowdy group. The bread cart was incredible, actually every part of this meal was incredible. I decided to go with the three course tasting and it was beyond words. The dessert cart was beyond delectable. I'm not even going to bore you with the details of what i had. All i can say is, if you can, try this restaurant and be prepared to be blown away!",

    "text": "I've been very lucky to have dined in many top rated restaurants and this place just earned a spot in the top 5 best meals of my life!!  We were thinking of trying the Degustation Menu, but from past experiences, I knew I couldn't possibly eat 16 courses and come out feeling good no matter how delicious the food is.  So, my husband and I opted for what turned out to be a 12 course meal, which was the perfect amount of food for the both of us.  We made sure to save room to indulge in their giant bread cart plus their after dinner and dessert -  dessert cart.  Yes, that is not a typo.  After you have devoured your multi-course dinner and dessert from the tasting menu,  they wheel out an impressive dessert cart and have you choose basically as many mini desserts as you want.  I will not go through each course since it probably changes seasonally, but everything was absolutely delicious.  The 2 stand out dishes of the evening was their salmon tar tar topped with caviar and the lobster appetizer.  Even their Veuve Clicquot tasted better than any other times I've had it.  It was probably due to the fact that they chilled it to the perfect temperature.  My only complaint is that they told me they had a strict dress code for men: jacket required, no logos on shirts, no jeans, etc.  However, when we walked in, we saw many patrons dressed in jeans with no jacket.  We even saw one guy in a Spiderman T-shirt.  Needless to say, my husband was annoyed because it was very hot in Vegas the week we were there and he was forced to wear long sleeves and a jacket.  All in all the service, ambience, and food was absolutely amazing.  I will definitely dine here again.     Bravo, Joel Robuchon, Bravo!!  Thank you for giving us 12 courses of heaven on a plate!",

    "text": "This was easily top 3 places i've ever been to.  Some of you are going, how is it not the best.  Robuchon is considered to be the chef of the century, yes, he is, and the food was amazing.  But to my specific tastes, not the best i've ever had.    Dress - says jacket required, so we suited up, but there were people in there in khakis and a polo, i didnt get it.    Me and my friend were sooo out of place, outside of being the youngest people in there, we're 24 and 25.  Everyone else was a rich fancy couple, and older then us.  The place is pin-drop quiet, and that was really annoying, as me and my friend wanted to talk about things.    Now, the place is amazingly decorated, as you'd expect.  Everything is as you'd expect.  You get a waiter/ress for each part of the meal etc.  There is a bread cart that you get to choose from, all of which are amazing, as is the butter, and the spanish olive oil, i have a place in my heart for spanish olive oil vs italian olive oil.  We, as younger kids, opted for the two course menu for $160 each, even though we wish we could afford the 16 course one for $390.  You get a palette cleanser, which was good, and interesting, and def did what it was supposed to.  for appetizer, i got the Foie Gras, which was incredible, and the violet artichoke, i gotta say, might have stolen the show from the foie gras.  my friend got the chestnut soup.  we did not share cause the plates are kinda small. but we both had zero bad things to say.  Main course, i ordered the beef ribeye, and my friend ordered the sea bass.  this we tasted each others, and wow, again, both of these meals, neither of has had a bad thing to say about it.    Dessert, wow, this is where its at.  they have a tray, with 28 different pastries on it.  you get to choose 5.  1 of them, was easily the best dessert pastry i've ever had, it was similar to a puff pastry, wow. incredible.  Overall - hard to get a reservation, a must by the way.  worth going if you wanna spend the money, but id recommend doing at least the 4 course menu though.",

The man has the most Michelin stars for a reason. And if in Sin City already why not do gluttony right?  Go for the presentation of food. If you want to see how intricate and precise food can be this is it.    Go for the bread cart but try not to stuff yourself too much. It is a meal in itself.   Go for the plush purple dining room. Spot photos of old school celebs.  Go for the dessert cart! Stuffy service shot me an annoyed look when I continuously made him pull more and more treats off the cart but I don't care! Dessert cart was way better then the actual dessert I had with the meal which was the chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream on top.   If for no other reason go just for the POMMES PUREE!!!",

    "text": "A gold limo picks you up from wherever you happen to be staying. From there, down some random alley next to the MGM there is a set of iron gates. There is someone awaiting your arrival at the entrance to the Mansion. You are escorted to the restaurant like any other VIP.   After you are seated, you are presented the 16- course Menu Degustation and a menu of a la carte options. The only real choice is the $425 16-course menu.  The sommelier approaches and gauges your interest in their wine menu. Of course, there are so many lovely options. Best to order a pairing. The cheapest was $275 - I did not inquire about the even more expensive ones. It was a great value though as the pairings (every two courses) were pretty much all Grand Cru.   As for the 16 courses, they were pretty amazing. Current menu online (Jan 4 2013) is what we got for the description. The sea urchin was my favorite. There were many moments where I took a bit then looked at my accomplice and locked eyes with that kind of \"oh my god did you taste that?\" stare.   At the end, they bring a bag full of goodies to take home - your tasting menu (with parings if you got them), a souvenir book, and pretty much a loaf of tasty cake.  Was it worth it? It depends on how you budget your disposable income and if you can appreciate caviar and truffles. Service was excellent - all my questions were answered and there were never any awkward moments.  Dining time was about three hours. They also provide a limo back from the main entrance at the MGM.",

    "text": "I'm sorry. I tried. I really did. But Joel Robuchon fell short. Very short.   Please let me preface this by stating, in my opinion no meal, unless you choose it to be so, should be four hours long. And, let me state that my rating takes in to consideration the \"experience\" of dining at Joel Robuchon, which reaches beyond the food itself.  My wife and I celebrated our 20 year anniversary by a trip to what may be considered the best restaurant in Las Vegas, or possibly the country. It started off with a bang and initially, I was truly enjoying the experience. We arrived and were promptly seated. I was surprised by the size of the restaurant as it was quite small, which was very nice actually. The quaintness of the size kept the sound down and made the experience much more personal. And, the design of the restaurant was contemporary and modern without being too over the top \"mod\" like many other Vegas eateries.  One issue to note that was a arguing point with my wife and I was the strict dress policy for gentleman. Jacket and tie are required. No big deal. Happy to put it on for the anniversary. However, when I dine, I prefer not to wear a tie, like most men. I had a very nice suit and shirt, but knowing Las Vegas, I preferred not to wear a tie. My wife insisted so I begrudgingly put a tie on.  Again, \"jacket and tie are required\" to me means just that. As we walk in, there were many men dressed well in jacket and tie, sitting right next to other couples who's men were wearing jeans, sports coat with open collared, button down shirt with a t-shirt underneath.  Point: If you have a dress code, enforce it or why even bother.  Service began very attentively and the pacing was fantastic. The menu was described well and we were enjoying the experience. The pace of the meal is important to me and everything was going well. Drinks were ordered, wine with assistance of the sommelier, our dining selection made, all is well with the world.   The bread and courses began. The bread selection was impressive and the knowledge of the waitstaff impressive. Everything was amazing. Pre appetizer, appetizer, soup, wine, cocktails, mineral water, water, music, perfect. Presentation was artistically superb.  And then, something happened. Maybe a shift change (joke) or possibly the world started rotating backwards? Time space continuum shift? Who knows. While waiting for our main course, the service came to a crawl. Attentive still but very, very slow. It took 45 mins before our last appetizer and our main courses to arrive.  I ordered the Beef Cheeks as I was feeling like having beef. They arrived nicely appointed. Slicing into them they were very tender, in a miso based sauce. The problem immediately was taste. It literally tasted like my mothers pot roast. This couldn't be so I tried again. And sure enough, mom's pot roast. I asked my wife if she wanted to try as I explained my dilemma. And sure enough, I could see the disappointment on her face as everything else had been so delightful.  Ok, one bad dish, albeit the main course, I'm willing to overlook it. However, we're now stuck with this issue with service. It's getting slower and slower and slower. The pace between the next few courses was just painfull. Time between our main course and dessert was another 45 mins. Then our anniversary cake. Then we were politely told that the dessert tray needed to be replenished. Very politely and with courtesy, but we'd already had been there for three hours and I was getting testy.  The dessert tray was a work of art and the man in charge of them extremely knowledgeable. They were fantastic as well.  One thing to note. I ordered sparkling mineral water and my glass barely had a sip out of it and it was refreshed by the wait staff. Fantastic! However, once it was empty, the bottle removed but I remained thirsty. I had to ask for water three times. Each time it came promptly but being thirsty, I drank it and i had to again ask for it to be refilled. Additionally, I enjoy cold water. This water was room temperature. No problem. I'll just request ice water, which I did and I still got the same room temperature water.  Post meal, a nice little bag was given with a great brochure recapping our meal which was a nice touch. Then our check came in a very timely manner, which was as expected.   So, what is my main complaint? No complaint actually. More of a disappointment really. My low rating was purely based on meeting expectations for a well rounded dining experience supposedly one of the best in the country. I expected a world class experience and didn't get it. I felt the pacing of the meal started out perfectly, after the main course however, I'm unsure as to what happened. The main course was a disappointment.  The wait staff delightful and extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.  Overall, my wife enjoyed it very much and that's all that matters. ;)~",

    "text": "My biggest regret about eating at this restaurant is that I don't have a second stomach. Every dish was so rich and flavorful, I wish I could have comfortably fit all of it into my one stomach. The bread cart selection was fantastic. I loved the basil and saffron focaccia and though I probably should have saved the room for the actual courses from the tasting menu, I finished my breads with a generous amount of butter. The caviar was great and the chestnut foie gras soup! Oh the soup was magical. So rich and smooth and flavorful, very en pointe. This is a restaurant where you can tell why it's expensive just by the ingredients used. The crispy black truffle tart used a good amount of truffle and it was actually my first time eating the actual mushroom instead of a derivative of it like truffle butter/sauce, etc. I hadn't seen such a large amount of the mushroom used in any other restaurant so I was kind of impressed. All of the courses were great, the restaurant decor quite lovely, and the servers very attentive but the atmosphere was a little stuffy and the portions were a little much, leaving me feeling overstuffed at the end. Overall though, it was a very nice dining experience and I would go again but order from the prix fixe menu instead of the degustation.   Oh and if you have a sweet tooth, the dessert cart doesn't disappoint.",

    "text": "My first Michelin 3 Star Restaurant starring the Chef of the Century.  Well, not exactly, since we didn't get to meet Mr. Robuchon.   However,  The experience was amazing even sans Robuchon. And that's exactly what it is - an experience. Like going to the theater or opera. It's not just *eating.*   Be prepared to spend some serious cash, but if you are considering dining here, you probably already knew that.  First off, the restaurant is beautiful. I love the color combination of silver, purple, and black so I felt wrapped in shimmery goodness. Behind my shoulder to the right was Chuck Norris, and to my left was Nic Cage, so I was also in good company.  They offer 5 menu options for you to select your own dishes. Each person at the table can have a different tasting menu which was a nice surprise, as most restaurants don't allow that. The first menu option starts at $109 and the 16 course degustation is close to $400. I went with a menu option that inlcluded an amuse bouche, a soup, an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. As with all of the tasting options, you also get to select from the amazing bread cart at the beginning of the experience, as well as from the decadent mignardises cart at the end.  To recap our 3 hour experience:   The bread cart: If bread can be described as beautiful, this cart certainly was. I had bacon bread, basil brioche and saffron brioche.  Amuse bouche: Caviar on top of a crab and lobster salad. This was excellent and a perfect contrast of salty and sweet. My favorite part was when our waiter said something like: \"Mr. Robuchon requests that you dip your spoon to the bottom of the dish to taste the full flavor combination.\"  Appetizer: Salmon tartare topped with caviar. Very good, but probably the least memorable of all of my dishes.  Soup: Chestnut and foie gras with bacon and celery foam. Ah, those little pieces of foie gras were scrumptious.   Entree: Turbot and octopus with a lemongrass emulsion and baby leeks. Perfectly executed.   Dessert: A whimsical combination of creme brulee, hazelnut pop rocks candies, chocolate marshmallow, and ice cream. The plate was decorated with metallic purple paper and purple sparkles. Love.  The mignardises cart: So glittery and pretty. I sampled a blueberry opera cake, strawberry white chocolate cheesecake, limoncelo macaroon, caramel with chocolate, and raspberry chocolate cake. Served with Brazillian french press coffee.   In lieu of dessert: My husband opted to choose from the very impressive cheese cart. Wow. As with the bread and pastry carts, you can basically select an unlimited amount of cheese. Unable to resist, I snuck a few pieces of his cheese. If you are so-so on desserts, definitely go this route.   Other random musings: If you are staying at the MGM and sign up for the Prima VIP upon check-in deal, you get a free bottle of champagne with your meal! When you make your reservation, just mention Prima.  There's also a free limo service that will bring you to the restaurant. We didn't partake since we were staying at the MGM.  I regret that since they drive you by the luxurious Mansion at the MGM, which most people don't know exists. It runs $5-15k/night.   In conclusion: If you win big in Vegas and appreciate an excellent culinary experience, definitely come here to celebrate. But please don't don your Flamingo attire - jackets and cocktail dresses are a must.",

Each dish was better than the previous, though we exclaimed \"this is by far the best thing i've ever had\" after each one.  The bartender was so friendly, gave us a few tastings of wine he thought we would like after conversation, as well as a little sample of Whiskey for me.  It was unpretentious and really did feel like the place where \"chef's go to eat.\"  I would recommend this to everyone and I would book a trip to Vegas just to go back here.",

We have had much more enjoyable meals at 3 Michelin star restaurants around the country at a fraction of the price. Nothing about the preparation or cost of ingredients justified the price. Another star off for how sound traveled in the restaurant. We sat next to two loud and obnoxious tables. While the restaurant overall is quiet, the proximity and arrangement next to these two tables made us feel like we were sitting with our neighbors and in their extremely obnoxious conversations.",

    "text": "#LatePost... Fine dining at its best!! You better bring your taste buds ready AND your WALLET though! :) A reason to go? It's the only Joel Robuchon in N.America (well besides its little brother restaurant next door; L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, aka \"The Workshop\").   Had dinner here on Monday 08/10 after the closing of a business convention I was attending to that week, was there for 6 days, so I HAD to try this place. I must say I was very impressed with the decor, elegance and the service. Not only that, but the ambiance and of course the food, although small meals, it was still modest and delicious. This place embodies the essence of luxurious Las Vegas for sure! That bread cart was awesome, who would've thought that bread would actually create dozens of different taste experiences. Love the interior design; we were walked in through a gorgeous garden, were seated in a corner booth full of luxurious and purple design, very nicely decorated and private. From our seats, we were able to see the huge chandelier from the central dining room.  This place is perfect for a romantic dinner! Well it can also be for a casual, business dinner or whatever your reasons are. David's service was great, kind and very helpful, especially when it came down to pairing a meal course with the perfect wine selection. I had the tasty mouth-watering signature \"Le Veau\" dish. Finished with a La Pomme, which is kind of like a merengue sphere filled with vanilla apple cider ice cream, absolutely magnificent! What a balance of subtle flavours. Definitely coming back here next time I am in town. Now I see why it's amongst Las Vegas best restaurants! Eating here is like having to eat at the best international restaurants without having to fly.  The money spent here is definitely worth the experience, thank you Joel Robuchon!!",

    "text": "I don't know that I would ever pay the amount that was paid for this dinner. But I'm going to take the price out of my review and just pretend that it was not outrageous. The bread cart was the holy grail of bread carts. I wish I had not listened to the reviewer who recommended not overdoing the bread. The courses were all outstanding and presented very beautifully. The dessert in a jar was unspeakably delicious. I loved that they added foie without overdoing it. The Le foie gras and the frog leg were my favorites. The beef thing was also a fav.  If I had to criticize something, it would be the table set up, with did not lend itself to intimacy.  Instead of a table with one person on each side, it was like 2 tables for 2 next to each other. The four of us seemed far apart and with some of the services coming at lengthy intervals, it could be awkward to talk across the space. There seemed to be very little talking in the restaurant. I don't know, it could be the obsession with the food. The wine pairing was $295. I found the pours to be generous and am sure I received over a bottle in totality based on my level of intoxication by dinner's end. In the end, we were all pretty happy and full but not \"vomit\" full.  We would come back for a lesser tasting, but I will consider the $445 tasting menu a once in a lifetime.",

    "text": "Ok, when I'm spending $$$$ dollars on dinner. I want perfection so I am being incredibly nit picky in this review. We went for our anniversary and bottom line Joel Robuchon is not allergy friendly.  First The Positive: The food I ate was very good. It was well executed and has obviously been practiced well. Some of the servers were very good. The limo ride was a nice touch. It is a beautiful dinning room.   The Negative: My hubby has a milk & cheese allergy. I realize French food is full of milk & cheese however as an amazing restaurant. They can work around the allergy with proper notification.   When I made the reservation a month in advance I let them know about the allergy. When the restaurant called to confirm the day before I double checked that they had the allergy down. They did. I also called the day of the dinner and reconfirmed they had down his allergy. They did.   When we got to the restaurant. He informed the waiter of his allergy and asked for help ordering.   He was disappointed because instead of getting a special menu or told trust the chef the kitchen will make you something or allowed to order off menu items.  He was just guided around the menu and told you can't eat this or this or this or this or this ect. but you can have...leaving only very few course choices.   The same with the bead cart and the dessert cart. \"You can't have this or this or this\", leaving few choices of what he could eat.   We were also told usually an anniversary couple gets a cake but it's a chocolate cake made with milk so instead we got NOTHING! HELLO we gave you ample warning about his allergy there are plenty of cakes or other desserts in this world he can eat. Nice way to make us feel special. *sarcasm*  The menu seemed a little stagnant. Don't get me wrong the food I got was very good but seemed a like the kitchen has been doing it the same way for a very long time with little deviation. Maybe that is why the kitchen was so unwilling to make items my hubby could eat all of their creativity has been stifled.   I got the crab and caviar, langustine ravioli, pea soup, veal cheeks, beef rib eye and desert and the desert cart.  He did get one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. We both ordered drinks and wine. The ice cider was great.   The hubby ordered what he could. He wanted me to have a good time so it wasn't until about an hour after dinner he mentioned that he needed to stop somewhere to get something to eat because he was still hungry.  The portion sizes would have been fine if he could have had more choices to order from. I felt really bad.   We have gone to Alex in the past. They are much more allergy friendly. On the fly they made an entire multi course dinner and dessert for him of foods not listed on the menu. He loved everything!  He is easy to please as long as he can eat it without going to the hospital.   In my opinion it was a total customer service FAIL. He couldn't eat at Joel Robuchon and was forced to watch his wife savor 6 courses over 4 hours. Is this fine dining or a lesson in torture?  This was not reflected in the rating but I thought I would mention it.  I have a pet peeve: fake candles. They just bug me and they were on every table.",

Perhaps also one of the most expensive restaurants I've ever been to as well.   Unlike many Vegas restaurants this one is very quiet and reserved with a very conservative feel to it. Our party was by far the loudest in the restaurant and we were pretty subdued. Service is french style, with many courses served in small portions.... each one more amazing than the last. The wagu beef entre was amazing! Our server spok in a very soft tone and explained each course before it was served.   I'd love to come back here but there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas it's hard not to want to try new things.",

For a price tag of over $400 a person for the degustation, it takes a lot to not have any buyers remorse.  Everything here was just perfect.  Service, decor, food...all outstanding.    The second you step inside, you completely forget you are in the MGM Grand, it's a beautiful restraurant.  It reminds me of Daniel in NYC.  Very small and intimate, it probably only seats around 40 people.  Service was spot on.  Everyone was friendly and extremely attentive without hovering.  Anything you needed was not a problem.  The food was the best thing!  I have heard of Joel Robuchon for years, but never had been to any of his establishments.  His food rates up there with Thomas Keller, Jean-Georges, and Daniel Boulud.  Whimsical and amazingly presented, wonderfully creative plates, perfect wine pairings.  Everything far surpassed our expectations.  Plus the amazing birthday cake, with the joke candle that wouldn't blow out was really a unexpected and fun surprise.  One of our favorite dining experiences.  If you can foot the bill, treat yourself to a dinner here.  We will be returning anytime we are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I had very high expectations going in, and I was not disappointed.  I've eaten at a lot of amazing places, I was raised foodie, and very little intimidates me.  But I will have to say, I was kind of on the defensive when I came here.  First of all, it was a little awkward as I was dining solo.  My dinner companion had bailed on me, so I was going in on my own.  Additionally, I didn't make a reservation and just sauntered in.  Glad I had an extra sportcoat with me.  The ambiance was amazing, beautiful, exactly what I expected.  The two hostesses were tall, gorgeous women in couture dresses.  As I was mustering up courage to enter, I pulled the two huge front doors way too hard, almost causing a scene.  As I sauntered up to the stand, quickly regaining composure, I announced I would like to have dinner and didn't have a reservation.  There was some murmuring and they asked me to sit in the lounge while they spoke to the manager.  I didn't even have a chance to sit and they whisked me away to my table.  I was seated on the bench side of a table for two, with a couple next to me and a third gentleman dining alone immediately next to them.  This is significant, because I couldn't help but eavesdrop, as it was so quiet in the restaurant and we were all in such close proximity.  The male half of the couple seated next to me, was on the opposite side of the table, and the bastard would not stop looking at me during my meal, which was frankly just weird and did detract from my overall experience.  They asked me if I wanted a cocktail, and when I said Martini, they correctly assumed gin and asked for my preference.  I chose Hendricks and recommended they use a cucumber slice as a garnish.  The server came back with a perfect Martini in a crystal glass, and he told me that the bartender said 'thanks' for the idea of a cucumber garnish, that it paired perfectly - he said they would recommend it in the future.  I started with amuse-bouche of a tomato puree served over a custard - perfect combination of flavors. I must take a moment as well to mention that the table setting was beautiful, all silver flatware, perfect china, and sparkling crystal vessels.  Whenever I would finish with a utensil or another dining implement, they would spirit away the offending dirty item to an impossibly large silver tray in the center of the room, which they would carry away only to immediately replace with another giant silver tray.  It was almost humorous when it was a lone cocktail glass.  Next they arrived with a huge cart full of dozens of freshly-baked breads.  I spent half of my time just being walked through what was contained on the cart.  Not wanting to spoil my meal, I chose a modest selection, although the gentleman manning the cart was insistent that I try more.  I settled on a fresh Gruyere brioche  and a roll that had bacon within.  Then another fellow came by and engaged in a complex ritual where he carved fresh butter from Brittony with a chilled spoon and put it on my plate with a little fleur de sel.  The bread was incredible, unsurprisingly.  Next up, I had the langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage.  Not only was it a delicate flavor explosion, it also had fantastic texture.  Thank goodness there were only three, because I am quite sure I could have eaten a bucket of them.  The next course was a fava bean soup served over a rosemary foam, again, flavors were incredible and there was just enough to get the flavor, but not too much.  During the meal, the service was not only incredibly attentive, but also not pretentious.  I really appreciated that.  For my main course, I had a splendid duck breast with foie gras and almond-stuffed sweet and sour cherries.  Easily the most perfect duck I have ever partaken of, and the sommelier paired the perfect wine with it.    To finish the meal, I chose the Earl Grey rice krispy with raspberry milk mousse, a nice blend of sweet and tart.  I ordered some fantastic coffee and they ended with the dessert cart, where the gentleman who manned that cart foisted more and more treats upon me.  I especially loved the baba ahrum, caramels and the jellies he offered.  I felt as one should after a repast like this, completely sated.  Price be damned, this is what culinary art tastes like.",

Upon arrival, we were led to a private area with beautiful decor and a nice scent from fresh roses. I noticed right away that they had Christofle silverware. Only the best.  We did the 16 course tasting menu. It was a no-brainer. You come to Robuchon for what the chef recommends. There were a few courses where I thought they went too heavy on the salt, but otherwise very delightful. I started becoming full at around the 8th course, but that didn't stop me from finishing everything. Go light on the bread basket in the beginning. The full dining experience took 3 hours.  Everything was exquisite. It was quite the journey. I expected nothing less from Robuchon. Comparable to the one in Macau, which I also tried and loved.  Final damage for 2 (+ we each ordered one drink and after dinner coffee) == $1200 and a few extra pounds. Unforgettable experience. Oh, and the chocolate bar that you get to take away? OMG nom.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Joel Robuchon, and I'm perfectly willing to admit that it's because this joint is way out of my league... financially.  We read many reviews about this place and found them to be accurate, particularly when they addressed the quality of the food.  NO QUESTION, this was the best food we have had in Vegas (and perhaps ever). Everything, and I mean everything, was just knock your socks off delicious, complex, interesting, and indulgent.  The service was beyond impressive, too.  Everyone knew what everything was, the wait staff was choreographed to negotiate huge trays (with or without food on them) in a way that made the whole operation look like a Balanchine ballet.  So you can imagine how hard it is to find anything to complain about.  The culinary experience was near-flawless.  Wait a darn minute, what do mean \"near\"?  Well, two things: (a) the portion sized and (b) the price.  I still stand by my statements about the quality.  I had a lobster cooked with uni (sea urchin roe) on a bed of truffle risotto that was to die for.  The problem is that the portion fit on what was basically an oddly-shaped, ramekin-sized soup bowl.  And so it was with the other portions: barely enough to tease your palate, have you humming in delight, and it's gone (who knows, the portions were so small that I suspect evaporation might even be a factor).  Then came the bill.  Good grief.  Let me digress: at seating, one of the waiters asked if we wanted to start the evening with some champagne. We said \"sure,\" to which he replied \"white or pink?\"  What the heck, \"one of each.\"  That statement, as it turns out, added $70 to the bill.  I'm not going to divulge how much the meal set us back, but I'll give you enough for an educated guess.  Not being able to even think about the 16-course, $495 chef's course, we opted for the $165 prix fixe, which had four courses: amuse bouche, appetizer, entree, and a thin plate of chocolates for dessert (the bread cart came by before the appetizer, too).  A bottle of Riesling cleared the century mark, you know how much the champagne was, one of the appetizers came with a \"surcharge\" (I think it was because it had extra truffle or something), and we did have some Hungarian Tokaj to sip with the chocolates.  The term \"sticker shock\" doesn't quite cover it.  I'll end this (my first yelp review) by emphasizing that if I were a person of more affluence (in this case, much more), I would most likely not care about the bill because the food was so good, it would eclipse the expense.  We came, we ate, we enjoyed, we marveled, we learned and we'll most likely never be back.",

Mesa Grill was disappointing; BARMASA was a disaster.  The burger at the now-closed Daniel Boulud Brasserie was not quite as tasty as the one at db Bistro Modern in New York City.  Rao's, Guy Savoy--the list goes on and will surely keep going on in the future.  So even with the imprimatur of three Michelin stars, I was a bit skeptical visiting Joel Robuchon--after all, Picasso and Guy Savoy received two stars each in the 2009 rankings, and I was relatively disappointed with both.  Joel Robuchon bucks the trend.  First, the restaurant environment is fantastic:  Not too large, there are purple highlights and silver trinkets everywhere, including slightly creepy framed black and white photographs of Nicholas Cage and Dennis Hopper that certainly take the edge off.  The lighting from the ceiling is dramatically aimed onto each table and certain spots in the restaurant, including where the bread cart is kept.  The sound insulation is also impressive as you remain completely unaware of the din of the casino floor until you step outside the restaurant doors.  The space as a whole is extremely elegant and formal while retaining a hint of the playful and whimsical.  The experience begins with the bread cart, a wide selection of different flavored breads including bacon bread, cheese bread, milk bread, saffron bread, and basil bread.  Selections off the bread cart are taken away and reheated.  Personally, I would have preferred a much narrower selection of freshly baked bread, but such is the fair trade-off to enjoy the variety.  The basil bread with the olive oil is a great combination, and I also enjoyed the relatively subtle flavoring of the saffron bread.  The Blood Orange amuse bouche provided a good pre-meal awakening of the senses.  The dry ice under the bowl provided a visually impressive effect, while the slightly sharp taste of the blood orange stirred the palate.  The Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with Chopped Cabbage as an appetizer was truly amazing.  The ravioli contained whole pieces of langoustine, and the black truffle--including the thin strips of truffle delicately set on each of the three ravioli--fit with the slight sweetness of the langoustine.  Pair the truffle sauce with the saffron bread for another great combination.  The Foie Gras and Bacon Foam Soup with Celery was good, though probably something I would trade for other options in the future.  The taste of the bacon is present and tightly controlled in the foam, and the small pieces of foie gras were a solid addition.  I would view this soup more as a respite along the course of the meal rather than a major attraction.  The Spaghetti with Soft Poached Egg and Shaved Black Truffles was a straightforward but nevertheless impressive dish.  The homemade spaghetti is covered with a layer of black truffles circled around a single poached egg.  The recommendation is to break the egg and stir everything together, thus mixing the spaghetti with an egg and truffle sauce.  The result is certainly gooey, but I actually enjoyed the texture as well as the taste--though the truffles were a lot more subtle than I had expected (given the sheer quantity involved).  My second entree was the Beef Ribeye.  I enjoyed the accompanying vegetables but the beef itself, while good, was not really superior in any way.  The side of whipped potatoes are extraordinarily creamy, seemingly more butter than potato.  It is probably much too rich for some but definitely worth at least a taste.  The second entree was followed by a cheese course, selecting cheeses from a cart of about 15 or so.  Dessert was a Chocolate Souffle topped with Chocolate Sorbet.  The chocolate-chocolate combination was overkill but admittedly my own doing--I would recommend going with the other sorbet selection or none at all.  The souffle is light but remains rather sizeable and is a bit of a challenge after such a large meal.  The service at Joel Robuchon was exceptional.  The sommelier stood out in particular, indulging us upon request with the history of selections of one of the winemakers in particular.  The wine list is quite impressive, tending towards--and appropriately so--\"special event\" level bottles.  If I had to nitpick, I wish something more could have been done with the Beef Ribeye, which seemed more like a convenience selection on the menu for those really hankering for beef.  Still, with the amazing and well-thought through restaurant space and excellent dishes like the langoustine ravioli and spaghetti with truffles, Joel Robuchon Las Vegas is certainly a destination-caliber restaurant worthy of five stars.",

    "text": "Yes, definitely the best meal we have ever had... Not only that, it was the best dining experience we've ever had.   The limo ride to the back entrance, the gorgeous courtyard and entryway, the personal greeting by the hostess who walked us through to the restaurant, the amazing lounge and ridiculous brandy cart - everything started great.  We began our meal with champagne to go with our amuse bouche and then the sommelier paired wines for each dish starting with a white for our app and then a red with our entree - great choices.  The bread cart was out of control. We sampled the bacon bread, the saffron bread, the cheese brioche and the rosemary baguette. You pick which ones you want to try and the server takes it in the back and warms it up for you.   Next, the famous amuse bouche came (caviar, etc). The caviar literally just melted in my mouth. It was really something. And the presentation of the dish was very unique...  For our app, we decided to go with the langoustine ravioli with the black truffle and fois gras reduction... the dish usually comes with 3 pieces, but we told them we wanted to share the app so they actually brought us two each - very cool.  For our entree we went with the Kobe dish and, of course, the pomme puree. I don't even know how to describe the pomme puree! It was like potato butter. It was THE most delicious \"mashed potatoes\" I've ever had in my life. I feel bad even calling them mashed potatoes lol... the kobe was VERY rich.. I've never had kobe that fatty and rich before. It was cut into cubes and served with vegetables.  The cheese cart was out of control too... All their carts are basically amazing. I have no clue what we decided to go with (because at that point I was in a full food coma) but we picked about 6 cheeses varying from soft to hard and they were all very unique. The big orange ball cheese is a must-have. I believe it's a sharp cheddar of some sort... There was one cheese that was super stinky for my taste lol... it was a soft brie I believe. Other than that they were all delicious.   For dessert we ordered a layered white chocolate mouse dish that had white liquor on top in a chocolate cup - it came on a dish that had coffee beans around it and toulle to decorate it - too cute.   The dessert cart was awesome too... there was a chocolate-topped macaron that was amazing.. they also had chocolate-covered ginger...  Oh, and the best part of the meal was when they rolled out a mini cake that the chef had prepared for us for our anniversary - yes, he makes cakes for special occasions!! It came out with this huge chocolate sculpture that looked crazy... wowsers.  Finally, they send you off with some nicely packaged sweets.. too bad it was sugar-coated jelly sweets - I was expecting some more of their chocolate lol. Oh well.   Service wise it's very interesting because at first it was typical snotty styles, but by the end of the meal we had had some of the best conversations with each of the servers. It was truly an enjoyable dinner from all angles. We got in at about 9:30 and didn't leave until 1:30.. None of that rushed stuff.. you truly get to sit down and enjoy yourself.  Oh, and the decor was delicious! The plush aubergine couches and silvers and lavendars... *sigh*  Love love love...... (going to post pics soon)",

    "text": "I've read ALL the previous reviews before my first visit last night. My partner and I decided to splurge for our anniversary. I agree with the majority of reviews. I have to say that although the overall expense was an order of magnitude higher than an average meal, this was not an average meal! I justified it like other costs when you go to Las Vegas - a dinner show, night club with limosine, or other wild adventures that you can only venture in Las Vegas.  For me it is a similar expense, since I have four kids and it always can end up pricey. For those on a budget, it is still doable. But since it it's easier to judge for yourself two of us each opted for the four course dinner. Some of the items you select from the detailed menu to fill in the menu have additional charge. We had no drinks except after dinner coffee and tea. Bottom line: $800 including tip.  So, if you are looking at value, maybe the 16 course meal is better priced.  Our four course meal was way too much food, though, so I have to guess that 16 courses would have put me in a coma.  You make your own decision. BTW, all the staff were friendly, not stuffy.  Of course I'm a happy guy so maybe they were just reacting to my smile.  Footnote:  I noticed that the la langoustine was hard to cut with the knife and chewy.  Why it was \"tough\" is beyond me.  Can anyone speculate?  Overcooked?  Frozen?  I can't imagine a 3 star Michelin doing either.",

Wife and I decided to splurge on our Anniversary dinner and went with the most expensive Prix Fixe option.  The items were small and for the most part delicious.  I wouldn't say that they were the best things I have ever eaten, but they do rank high on the delicious scale.  Their bread and dessert carts were just outright ridiculous, biggest carts I have ever seen with an incredible selection.  Service was also excellent, which I definitely expected given their Michelin rating and high cost.",

You forgot to put in the order and we had to ask again 20m later.  We also ordered from the pastry cart and sat for 40 min while the dessert didn't come.  Only when we asked was there shock that the item hadn't come and the offer to resubmit the order was extended.  This doesn't happen at 2 plus star Michelin restaurants more than once per table.  For 3 stars and 500+ pp this feels inexcusable.    Pros.  Limo was a nice touch.  Bread basket and olive oil were fantastic.  Crab course was best in class.  Olive oil ice cream course was also fantastic.    Cons: service overall and wow factor.  This is a 3  Michelin star restaurant.  Its supposed to be extraordinary.  So far its the best restaurant I've been to in Vegas but far from worthy of a 3rd star.  Saison and quince in sf are much better.    Its hard to deduct more than a full yelp star here but I think a good test is whether or not I'd return.  No, I won't.",

For the level of this restaurant we would hope we wouldn't have to ask for water refills, cocktail menu (more than twice, they forgot), they also forgot to bring our after dinner drinks, but we let it go...just to get the bill with the drinks on the check. Again, not the end of the world, but just several mistakes (seriously several mistakes that would have barely passed at an Olive Garden)... I hope they step up their game to regain the status of a restaurant that bares the name of Joel Robuchon.",

    "text": "What to say that hasn't already been said?  Well, this was my husband and my first really expensive fine dining experience.  We knew that we wanted the 16-course degustation, but knew we'd pay a hefty price, about half the cost of our entire mini-vacation!  So we knew it wasn't worth it.  Well, it was COMPLETELY worth it!  I do believe that dining like this is not for everyone (and I was a bit disgusted with some people wearing faded jeans to dinner - I mean seriously??), but if you like fine dining it is a must.  Out of the 16-course degustation, our favorites were the asparagus caviar, maki roll caviar, scallop, lobster, sea urchin, chicken, and soybean risotto - all of these were over the top amazing!  And this was coming from people who thought they didn't/wouldn't like caviar, sea urchin, and foie gras!  That being said, the rest of the courses were excellent too - not every one was something that I would order myself, but every dish was a surprise of tastes, a feast of the senses.  Of course, the service was spectacular as well.  The limo was right on time to pick us up at TI and an excellent addition to the experience.  The waitstaff did the best job I had ever seen and will be unlikely to be beaten in the near future.  Honestly, I only have positive things to say about this meal.  We will definitely be back, though it could be a few years (as it is very expensive!).  That being said, this is perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime experience, worth every penny, and I'll definitely be craving this food for YEARS.",

    "text": "10 Things you should know about dining at Joel Robuchon:  1) You will not be disappointed, except by the price which might make you cry.  2) They send a free limo to pick you up and drop you off at the restaurant from wherever you're staying.  3) Prepare yourself for at least a three hour meal. It's an experience afterall.  4) They will ask if you want champagne when you sit down. Each glass is $35-$45. Water is $10/bottle for Evian.  5) 16 Course Tasting Menu is $495/person without wine pairings - this is not listed on the website. Wine pairings go up to $999/person.  6) Bread Cart - AMAZING. There are dozens of types of breads. The cheese breads and the milk bread was my favorite. They carve your butter from a magnificent butter mountain.  7) What can I say about the food other than it was perfect. This is definitely a meal you will remember for the rest of your life. Every presentation, every flavor, every bite was absolute perfection. It was interesting and complex, unlike anything I've ever eaten before. You just have to try it.   I recommend the Riz, a rice pilaf with sea urchin and lobster. It was my favorite course of the night.  Every main course dish also comes with Robuchon's famous whipped potatoes. SO CREAMY!  8) Mignardises is the sweets cart they offer at the end, full of chocolates and pastries. My favorites were the creme brulee and the cream puffs.   9) They give you a little present (if you're a girl) before you leave of chocolate and a booklet on the dining experience.  10) If you're there for a special occasion, there is complementary cake (or gateau *pinky up*)  PS Don't forget to ask them for their finest glass of Keystone Light",

    "text": "This place is overpriced and overrated.  It's a three Michelin start restaurant, so going there, my expectations were high. Considering I've been to other michelin-rated restaurants before, I expected this one to be at least at the same level. And since they advertise that Joel Robuchon is a chef of the century and has more Michelin stars than any other chef in the world, I expected this place to be out of this world.  So, what's the reality? Let's start with good stuff. The place looks nice. The bread cart is awesome. Deserts are very good. That's about it. You pay $500 for bread and chocolate.  Now the bad. I got a 5 course pre-fix menu. I was there for 3.5 hours. Of course I was hungry all that time so I kept on eating bread. Maybe that's why I appreciated it so much. It took 90 min for us to get our first course. It was okay. Not bad. Just okay. Looked sort of nice, but wasn't exciting. The overall menu wasn't exciting in general. Other Michelin-rated chefs invent new things you can't imagine, like caesar salad ice cream with snail caviar. This place had ravioli with lobster meat. I can name 10 other places from the top of my head that have this.  The bathroom was dirty. While they would be quick to remove an empty plate after each course, they never removed by little bread plate, which sat there dirty for a long time with bread crumbs being all over the table. My wine list was missing a page with wine by the glass. When I finally got a replacement menu, I got a sticker shock. I understand high end restaurants, but $49 for a glass of less than average wine? Why? And why would a restaurant with a world class wine list offer cabernets by the glass if they are younger than 10 years old? This shouldn't even be an option. Every self-respecting sommelier will tell you that it's not even wine at this age. Of course I couldn't select any wines by the glass because the selection looked terrible so I got the most expensive one hoping it'd be good. It was below average. The sommelier asked me how it was. I told him I didn't like it. He didn't answer anything and walked away. Feeling desperate to drink something, I called him again and asked him to see the cocktail list. He brought me the menu, opened the page with whiskies and proceeded to sell me on his whiskey selection, not saying a word about cocktails. I turned to the cocktail page myself and got upset there again. A place like this should at least be somewhat inventive about cocktails. These cocktails were simple, made with basic ingredients. It looked like something you would get at a cheap bar. Even TGI Friday's has a better cocktail selection.  To make things fun for us, our waiter completely disappeared from our lives somewhere after our second course. I saw him walking around but he never came to our table again. We waited for him to bring us our check and he never showed up. So we caught a busser and asked him for a check, which he gladly brought us. When the check arrived, it was a lot more than I expected. Why? Because they have additional surcharges for items you select on the pre-fix menu. The menu I selected was $250. I asked the waiter for recommendations. He took the menu from me and told me about his favorite choice. I followed his recommendation, not knowing that what he was recommending would cost extra. At the end I paid $500. I think the food I got was worth $100 at most based on quality.  That doesn't sound like a three star restaurant to me. In fact, I don't believe it truly is. If you go to Michelin's web site and search, it doesn't show up in search results. You can even select Las Vegas as a city and get a message from Michelin that there are no Michelin-rated restaurants in Vegas. Why? Because Joel Robuchon received these starts over 10 years ago.

We were lucky and got a reservation here since we have been talking about dining here for a long time. We opt for the 6 course meal for $250 each, definitely on the pricey side of all the 3 star restaurants. We also were not told about the complimentary limo service provided by the restaurant & drove ourselves and had to pay valet.  The interior decor was very grandier, traditional, tasteful and bright. We were seated in a corner booth in nice coushy seats. The plate setting was perfect, so was the service, military precision. There were more service staff than customers! Silverware replaced and table cleaned after every course.  The food was amazing of course but the highlight of my meal has to be the as assortment of sweets and candy provided at the end of our meal. I got really greedy and asked for one of each and was having a total blast riding the sugar high for a while. Great meal and lovely staff.",

    "text": "Honestly, I'm not a fan of places like this.  Of course the food is going to be good.  It should be at the prices customers are being charged.  Is it insanely good?  Do my eyes roll to the back of my head when I take a bite?  The simple answer is no.  The reason is simple.  The food isn't unique.  It's good and very much like every other high end French restaurant I've been to.    The formula goes like this:  - Lots of art, mirrors, white linen tablecloths, silverware changed every five minutes, 14 different people serving you, etc, etc - Menu written in French with short English translations underneath.  Usually you haven't heard of either the preparation style or the ingredients - Foie gras is always heavily involved (yes, I'm a sucker for anything foie gras related) - Many courses - Many very small courses - Lots o' butter (albeit very good butter) - The appetizers and the mains are very good (seared foie gras!,  white (because green is just too ordinary) asparagus with a tangy sauce, and four tiny bites of rib eye, which was very nicely aged, but it was missing that rib eye fat sizzle) - Desserts are off the hook (the souffle, oh my!)  The only thing unique about Joel Robuchon's is the amazing sweetscart.  And by amazing, I'm talking forty different kinds of candied deliciousness!  So, yes, JR is a very nice place to go and eat.  They even cater to the celiac diseased among us.  But, the experience is ordinary high end and that was a disappointment.",

    "text": "I spent 26 years working in kitchens around the world. I was extremely lucky to work for some generational talents along the way, while its been 20 plus years since I worked in London, I worked for a chef that when food looked perfect and tasted prefect he would us the term \"That's like sex on a plate\" to describe it.   I have no words to describe the food other than, It was sex on a plate.   My wide and I ate there for our wedding anniversary on our annual Vegas trip. It was taken a couple of year for us to be able to get a reservation during our trip but it was worth the wait.   It is as so many point out expensive however for 16 plates that were amazing I don't feel it was that crazy when Sage at Aria is 1/4 of the price for 7 courses Picasso at the Bellagio is3/4 of the price for 8 courses. You pay for what you get.   From the moment they open the door for you the highest level of service is given to you. The bread selection when it is brought to you is almost over whelming but not to worry they will bring more and more, you can try as much as you want but take caution, it you are a True foodie and you opt for the full 16 course chefs menu don't fill up on bread.   One of the amazing things that I noticed was each persons place is cleared one at a time, there was no stacking of plates and silverware after each course. Not once during you evening did I hear plates clink not the jingle of silverware on plates either.   As the menu changes really no point in going in depth on dishes, I will post some pictures of some of our dishes.   This is a True dining experience but its not for everyone based on the cost.",

    "text": "Overall: 5+  Food: 5+ Service: 5+ Value: 3  Joel Robuchon is an extremely high end restaurant in Vegas. They only have a dozen tables or so, and it's hard to get reservations, so book early! I came here with some friends for my bachelor party and we each got the tasting menu, which was $445 a person (before tip and tax) and consisted of 8 substantial courses.   Fantastic food, both in flavor and presentation. The environment was classy and elegant. The dress code is business formal, i.e. men wear suits. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive, and they also helped take a photo of our group. It's hard to judge the value of the meal since these types of restaurants generally provide unique experiences and are not meant to be dined at daily. That said, I certainly felt it was worth trying here at least once, but wouldn't come here unless it was a very special occasion, since it's quite pricey.  At the beginning, you are presented with a bread cart, and it's pretty much take what you want. Then they bring you each course after you finish the previous course. The serving portions, by the way, may appear small, but it quickly adds up and we were practically stuffed after the five savory courses, before the dessert even arrived! In retrospect, we probably ate too much bread from the bread cart, but it was sooooo good. At the end, there was a macaron cart, again take what you want, but I only had two macarons because I was at my limit by then.  Each course was unique in flavor and it's actually difficult for me to pick a favorite, but I would say the beef chop, the final savory course, was probably my favorite. The foie gras and seafood courses were also extremely delicious.",

I have been to a few 1 star and the experience was definitely elevated from that but I did not think the food itself was. We were sat in the gorgeous mock courtyard that made you feel like you were in a private French Garden. The sommelier made wine suggestions and we got a half bottle which was superb. The bread cart came next. A sensory overload of gorgeous French bread varietals rendered in miniature. After several selections they brought a cart with imported butter and salt to carve table side.  This might have been the best part of the meal for me. It was unexpected and wonderful. I had some classics and some interesting twists like a bacon and Dijon. We had the Chestnut Veloute and the Foie Gras Millefeuille for appetizers. Both were good but nothing life altering. We had the Veal Cheeks and the Ribeye for entrees. The Veal Cheeks were tender but I did not care for the Thai preparation. The Ribeye was fantastic. The sauce and spices came together beautifully. For dessert we had the Sphere and the Chocolate Souffle. The souffle was delicious but it was the sphere that was the unexpected star. The waiter described it as feminine. It was such an odd description but right on. It was delicate and floral. Complex and delightful. The miniature dessert cart finished the meal with a confectionary delight. I selected quite a few all of which were delicious. The parting gift of a lemon pound cake was a welcome treat to take home. Overall it was an amazing experience but for the price tag and the reputation I was expecting all of the dishes to be equally mind blowing.",

    "text": "Wondering if we had an off night. My friends had raved about this place but my husband an I agreed it fell flat for the hype and the price. I probably wouldn't go if you don't do the eight course meal. Which is $500. We got the three course and I it was not nearly enough food. I get French food is small portions, but the whole meal was probably less than four ounces of food. No joke! We had to stop and get a second dinner on the way home. I guess they expect you to fill up on the bread cart, which is pretty amazing but I'm not a fan of spending that kind of Money to eat bread.  Also think the most frustrating thing is the excessive surcharges ( $45-$75) to eat the signature dishes. I understand those ingredients are more expensive but no ingredient could cost that much extra when the servings are minuscule.  You are already paying on average $75 per course- so Yes, that means that the signature dish you don't want to mid, the one that is the size of three quarters, can be $150. We kind of felt a little bait and switch. Our bill ended up being a lot more than we were anticipating. The first bite they brought out was a fried grain ball. I actually had to spit it back into my napkin. Husband and I agreed it was pretty awful and bad texture. We got a passion fruit meringue that we thought was far too simple. I guess when you come to places like this you want to say \" holy crap, this is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.\" We didn't say that about anything we ate.  Our service was not on point for three stars. We had to fill our own water glass twice. It took awhile for the bread cart to come around. Some one not our waiter noticed we didn't have any bread and corrected it. I wish they would have come back around for a second offering. It's a one time selection so if you go, Load up. When the dessert tray came I asked for a panna cotta. The waiter nodded and didn't put it on the tray. I asked again and he looked at me like \"I heard you.\"  I figured maybe it would come from the kitchen but I never got it.  When they brought us the check they gave me a beautiful bag with a cake. They turned to my husband and the waiter said  \" and I have nothing for you.\"  I'm sure he was trying to be funny but my husband didn't find the humor in it. Also, they only have one ladies room for the whole restaurant. There were two ladies already in line. I might suggest they add a restroom.",

It's a romantic setting perfect for dates or proposals. I came here with a friend celebrating a promotion. We chose the an 8 course meal, and each and every item was mouth watering, delicious in all aspects. The duck and Foie gras was my favorite, it was so buttery and succulent it melted with each bite. The Kobe beef was like nothing you've ever tasted. And their cold pea soup was just delicious. Each and every item was detailed and gorgeous, you almost didn't want to touch it. They put so much love and pride in their food. They serve cheese and bread on a chariot in between servings and have the most beautiful desserts (also served on a chariot) Every display was breathtaking. The desserts were just as heavenly as they looked, filled with succulent divine flavors.  Their customer service was OUTSTANDING! They treat everyone like a celebrity, they even give you a parting gift with a book about the Chef, a menu with pictures and a golden flaked pistachio poundcake wrapped in cellophane.   If you're looking for a WOW factor, this is thee restaurant. From the second you walk in, you feel timeless. It's classy and gorgeous inside. And the food is perfection.",

    "text": "I'm excited to write this review because this was a memorable experience that I'll never forget. Joel Robuchon is a French restaurant that's ranked with Three Michelin Stars. I understand that spending this kind of money on dinner is probably unthinkable for a lot of people but you should do it at least once in your lifetime. We went here to celebrate one of my milestone b-days. I found this place online for my Las Vegas week trip. I chose this venue to actually celebrate my b-day on. It was everything I pictured from when I stepped inside. Remember that you'll be spending at least $400 for one individual person plus any add on's that you order. The hallway has this black and white checkered, tiled floor and glass chandeliers hanging all over. There are elegant tables situated around. When you walk in there are small tables along with beautiful purple couches, another chandelier, and a sophisticated ambiance that you feel when you walk inside. The back area (where we dined) is small and cozy with greenery hanging along the wall. So pretty and zen. It reminded me of dining in a fairy tale land. You get lost inside and feel relaxed.  We did the 17 course Degustation Menu. I cannot believe how full I got. I cannot remember all the French names of the foods we ate. However, I know that my main was scallops and my friend's main was filet. If you want to add additional samplings there's a charge such as an extra $50. I added the caviar and that was an additional $65. The caviar was placed on top of an egg (poached) and it was exceptional. Everything we had was like a work of art besides it being a slice of heavenly delight. We also had ordered 2 glasses of champagne but then went on to order a bottle of champagne as well. For 2 people the bill was around $1200.   I have to write separately about the dessert cart. It was so cute and adorable how they brought out this trolley cart with all these magnificent assortment of desserts. We did try the round, purple ball with ice cream inside that you hit with your fork to break open. We also had the chocolate cake inside the wine glass. Both were phenomenal. We added additional desserts of course from the cart. They were all simply divine. I wish I had more room but I was quite full. At the end, the wait staff brings out this delicious loaf of sweet bread wrapped in purple paper for all the women to take home as a token of appreciation. This cake/bread was so good - I brought this home to Mi to share w/ friends and family. The French chef came out at the end of the dinner/presentation to talk with all of his guests. I was very appreciative that he did that and liked the fact I could meet the chef that created this experience for my b-day. I have to also mention that my wait staff was excellent, very attentive, informative, presentable, and respectful. If I knew their names I'd mention them here. They were all spectacular! Thanks Joel Robuchon's for a once in a lifetime experience for my milestone b-day! I was very happy!",

We love every single plate especially the dessert! It was so good! I don't have a word to describe the dessert! It was so beautiful and tasty!  And they also give us an anniversary ice cream cake as a gift! Love this restaurant so much. This is the best Michelin restaurant in US!",

    "text": "It has been several months since dining at Joel Robuchon, but I still fantasize about the bread cart nearly every time I eat any type of bread.  I could imagine a meal just made from the bread cart itself.  But that would not do the rest of the experience at Rocuhon justice.  The decor, service, and food were all at the level of what would be expected of a three michelin star establishment.  From the moment we stepped into the quiet reception area out from the loud and bustling casino floor of the MGM, the experience was like no other.  Having experienced the Degustation Menu, I would have to write a book to describe what I loved about every item.  Here are the items that I enjoyed the most - albeit not taking anything away from the items not mentioned.  Bread - I can't say enough about the bread cart - I ate so many of the different breads that it made it difficult, but not impossible, to enjoy the main course of beef chop.  Caviar atop crab - I love caviar.  I love crab.  This combination dressed with a seafood gelee was amazing.  The detail in the preparation of the gelee and caviar looked like like an artist prepared it rather than a chef.  Green Pea and almond veloute - This dish gave me a newfound love of green peas - in a veloute that came together perfectly.  Foie Gras - This is what foie gras is all about.  Perfectly prepared, melt in your mouth, rich, but balanced with the cherries.  Beef Chop - Having lived in Texas for 12 years, it's all about steak.  I've had dry aged prime, kobe, akuashi, and several other 'best' steaks, but this seemingly nondescript 'beef chop' had to be one of the best cuts of beef I've eaten in my life.  The only regret I have is that Robuchon had such a great cocktail menu that we decided not to experience the wine pairings with the tasting menu.  I will definitely do that next time!",

    "text": "This review is for Joel Robuchon at The Mansion, not  L'Atelier. Be careful, as some reviews on this site refer to L'Atelier, not \"The Mansion.\"  Decor was borderline stunning, an environment designed to elevate restaurant to museum. Just wonderful.   Savory courses were wonderful, subtle and thought provoking. Flavor balances were COMPLEX but effortlessly enjoyable; in other words, flavors were harmonious and the complexity only added to the cognitive pleasure. I could not have asked more of the savory dishes. The dessert dishes fell short in comparison. While very good, the subtlety of composition and flavor of the dessert courses were not quite up to par with the savory courses, and not quite worth the cost of the meal. However, they were still quite excellent and the pastry chef was clearly working toward equality with the savory chefs.  Service was rather cold, but well organized overall with some glaring oversights, such as never removing bread crumbs from our table, not replacing our used bread plates, and an \"accidental\" overcharge of $700.00 for a \"wine dinner\" that we never ordered. I literally have not had a signifiant overcharge on my dining bill in the last 300 meals or so, even at some restaurants whose average meal costs $10.00. Not acceptable service or mistakes for a meal costing over $1000.00 US for two diners.  At this caliber of restaurant, I expect a \"wow\" factor not only from the food, but equally as much from the service.  The food strives for perfection and that is very evident with every course. While the food may not always make a perfect score, many dishes did and those that missed the mark did so by a hair. The service should also strive for such perfection, but such sentiment is not felt nor is evident in the final product.  Furthermore, Joel Robuchon, why would you admit somebody into this restaurant wearing sneakers, jeans, and a old worn-out unbuttoned casual shirt with rolled up sleeves? Such a fellow was admitted during our meal July 2008. He would not have met the dress code and gained admission into ANY of the commercialized, tasteless nightclubs littered around Las Vegas. The rest of us are here to enjoy your food and experience a meal that many of us actually save money to experience. For some of us, one meal at your restaurant is a significant financial \"investment\" in our palate that we do not take lightly. We dress well to pay respect to fellow diners and your gastronimic artistry.  All other male diners were wearing Jackets and over half wearing full suits.  I'm sure such slobs being admitted to dine at your restaurant are profoundly wealthy. I say this is still no justifiable reason. You have a responsibility to maintain some decorum for the enjoyment of fellow diners, and the investment THEY have made to support your establishment.  Would I visit again; a qualified \"yes.\" If the service and front house management improves, without a question yes.",

I chose the 16 course menu with the wine pairing and my wife chose the 6 course menu.  The timing of the meals coming out of the kitchen were perfect!! Not an easy task as we were not Eating the same food and I was getting about two dishes to every one dish my wife was. The food was prepared properly and the presentation was quite refined, something you would expect from dishes that he took from years of experience, but most of them lacked that wow factor in flavor. The best part of the meal was his great selection of breads and the dessert cart was amazing. My brother has been certified as a master in baking for ten years and is one of the best bakers in the world and the breads and dessert served at this restaurant are of an equal quality of some of his work.  The service was exactly what you should expect from a three Michelin restaurant. I scanned the dining room and it was clear that they had scattered the reservations and the seating of their guests so that there was no one seated near anyone else allowing for privacy and a feel of exclusivity.  Overall this restaurant is well worth it's three michelin stars!!",

    "text": "continue from the original review...  *******   like any True french restaurant (and italian), the moka was served to complete a meal. a miniature french pressed coffee for me (cappuccino and espresso are other options) and a pot of white chinese herbal tea for the hubby, accompanied by a complimentary surprise birthday cake, were presented to us. the coffee was quite delicious and strong but never with that bitter after taste. by then we were full, but this cake was phenomenal, the BEST THING I EVER ATE! this white cake was layered with fresh cream, passion fruit filling, mango sauce and meringue. i don't eat mango and i am partial to the sweetness of meringue, but the moment this cake touched my mouth, i knew i could die happily.   there are some notable things to elaborate in this review; the much talked about carts. there are 4 different carts being wheeled around throughout the dinner. all servers memorized each and every item on all 4 carts (that's like over 200 names)...quite a challenging task.   the first was the bread cart which seriously had more variety than any bakery i've visited. once we selected our choices, the waiter warmed them up before bringing them to our table. they were very generous with the bread and we enjoyed a few different types, but our favorites were the bacon epi baguette and cheese brioche. also, the french butter and olive oil were nothing like we had before, even in europe.   the mignardise cart which was stationed in front of the entrance ever beautifully was presented to us. we let the waiter use his magic and knowledge to pick the best for us. unfortunately, we could not consume more than 1 out of 10 pieces after that BEST EVER cake. our waiter kindly packaged these tiny, bite-sized desserts to take home along with two boxes of citrus and berry marshmallows (i can tell you that these are not your every day marshmallows!) and a colorful booklet showcasing joel robuchon las vegas.   the cheese cart which we did not partake in, looked quite impressive. i could smelled the pungent cheese a mile away. they were paired with nuts and pieces of fruits.   the last was a cart designated for tea. not only did this house a variety of dry tea leaves, it had live potted tea plants, from lemon grass to mint. all i could say was \"omg...unbelievable...omg!\" the waiter would cut the leaves of your choice, wearing white gloves, and serve the tea in a pot, heated and stayed warm by a candle.   another food item we were impressed by was the mashed potato which was served with our main course. this was pure butter (i don't want to know how much of butter was used here), and we could've had a bucket of this and more.   one last thing that made our experience at joel robuchon more memorable and unforgettable was the people who were dining around us. a table of chinese family in flannel shirt, fishing vest and white shocks (this is 100% True although i would not recommend this attire), paying everything in cash, a table of two jewish businessmen in fine italian suits sharing their experiences at pierre gagnaire and alain ducasse in paris, taking pictures of every dish for their wives, a table of a lone lady with french accent gormandizing the degustation menu ever graciously, a table of persians with their colorful ties, talking and laughing about how much they were down (i admire their good nature even when they lost so much), and a table of older couple congratulating our celebration of birthdays, envying the BEST EVER cake.  who's counting the michelin stars and aaa five diamonds?  this was a place that never tried to display an air of snobbishness you often face in other restaurants of this caliber. everyone talked to each other no matter where you came from.   at the end of the meal, we were escorted back to the mansion where a silver limo was waiting to take us back. the driver asked, \"did you take a picture with mr. robuchon?\" WHAT? the man was there? i guess it never hurts to ask. we found out the chef of the century usually shows up for long weekends when vegas gets busy.   i cannot wait to take this journey again. we cherished every minute of our dining experience here. we were treated more like friends surrounds by people who enjoy lives as much as we do. when you are here, take a look around the restaurant. amidst the ritzy extravagance, you'll see and appreciate the personal touches of joel robuchon everywhere.",

    "text": "This IS fine dining, period. Make no mistake when you enter Joel Robuchon's you leave the MGM casino well behind you into one of the pinnacles of gastronomy. This French restaurant is the first and only 3 Star Michelin winner in Las Vegas, and when my wife and I found out we decided we had to go! You go to Vegas for shows, right? Well, this was our show; and an edible, decadent one it was. You will eat nothing like you've eaten before is the only way I can describe it. We went for the full show: the 16-course tasting menu which lasted approximately 4 hours. The plating was perfect, the service and attention to detail were spot-on, the mood was perfect, and the food was amazing. We had truly a remarkable experience. Our menu was as follows below although there is main service missing (other than the exceptional glass of bubbly before dinner and wine service throughout the meal). It was *the bread cart*. Oh my goodness... Heavenly baked bread in many styles and shapes for you to pick and choose from.  L'Hiver Diner      * Le Petit Pois ile flottante au caramel de veau sur un lait a la menthe fraiche, mouillette aux graines de sesame       Floating island on top of cream of peas with hint of mint, veal juice, seasme seed fritter      * Le Caviar des asperge verte aux feuilles de melisse, une gelee recouverte d'une onctuesuse creme de chou-fleur, des fines graines de couscous iode       Green asparagus topped with Oscetra caviar, delicate gelee and a smooth cauliflower cream, thin couscous and oscetra caviar      * Le Saint-Jacques la noix poelee aux fregolas avec une emulsion coralline       Pan seared scallops with fregolas pastas and coral emulsion      * Le Homard roti au beurre demi-sel avec des rattes ecrasees et voile d'un cappuccino au vert       Roasted lobster with forked ratte potatoes, green cappucino.      * La Symphonie de Truffle une tarte friande aux oignons confits, des legumes premices de printemps mitonnes au foie gras, un fin veloute agremente de celeri       Black truffle in a hot pastry, onions and smoked ham, first vegetables in a green cabbage ravioli, light truffle cream on top of celeriac custard      * Le Parmigiano Reggiano avec un consomme vegetal de jeunes poireaux       Parmesan and vegatable consomme with baby leeks      * L'Oursin a la puree de pomme de terre au cafe (Blue Mountain) torrefie       Sea urchin, potato puree with a hint of coffee      * Le Tourbot cuit sur l' arete avec une etuvee de chataigne au jus truffe       Roasted turbot on the bone with chestnuts and truffle stew      * Le Boeuf comme une interpretation du celebre tournedos Rossini grille, foie gras laque ivre de porto vintage Taylor's, macaronis au vieux comte, cristalline au poivre       Grilled Kobe beef, roasted foie gras with port, cheese macaronis, black pepper cristalline      * La Nouille a la perle avec croustilles et sauce fleurette au lard fume a l'ancienne       Pasta prepared carbonara style, mimolette cheese and bacon      * Le Rouge Spice aux saveurs fruitees, sucre moscovado de l'Ile Maurice, rafraichi a l'ananas       Red berry coulis perfumed with spices, muscovado sugar from Maurice island and pineapple sorbet      * La Fuki pomme fondante, panacotta au vinaigre de cidre, glace a la cacahuete       Slowly carmelized apple, cider vinegar panna cotta and peanut ice cream      * Le Cafe ou le The escorte de mignardises",

Second trip was worse... service is pretty slow, people are quite nice tho... Had the tasting course... most of the food are sweet and had an asian/chinese twist in it. Well, I am Chinese, I don't want to pay 600 bucks for French-Chinese Food!!!....   Great decor... I give them credit for that, lots of wine selections as well.

    "text": "The wife and I recently went to celebrate our first anniversary. This was a great pick to mark that special occasion. The restaurant is a surprisingly small, intimate dining room with blue velvet booths (we scored one instead of a table), a stunning crystal chandelier, a nice grand piano in the corner being played throughout the evening, beautiful floral arrangements, waiters that bring food out like you've seen in the movies, about what you'd expect for what you spend there. Without going into boring details on everything, overall I would say if you can afford it and you enjoy fine cuisine, you probably can't go wrong here. If, however, you're like me and enjoy good food but aren't particularly well versed in fine French cuisine, you might want to save yourself a lot of money and go dine in one of Vegas' many other excellent restaurants that are still pricey but don't even come close to Rubochon's prices. OK, that being said, I'm going to describe each of the 16 courses I had with a brief commentary in case you're wondering what you might expect (I think they change it up nightly, so I wouldn't expect the same thing, but I'm sure it's similar).  First: L'Asperge Blanche. White asparagus \"panna cotta\", fresh almonds and lemon grass. Review: awesome. Second: La Tomate. Tomato with olive oil, basil, tomato gelee, topped with mozarella. Review: best friggin' tomato you'll ever eat. They serve it like a sliced patty with the oil drenched inside of it. Third: Le Caviar. Thin couscous and Oscetra caviar, smooth cauliflower cream, green asparagus gelee. Review: I'm not a huge fan of Caviar but this was pretty good and I'm sure it would make a Caviar connesieur blush. Fourth: L'Euf. Egg yolk in baby spinach ravioli with morels. Review: like everything else, the portion served is tiny. This was I think a single ravioli (or maybe two) with a very exquisite sauce and interior. Of course, unlike any ravioli you've probably ever tasted and pretty awesome. Fifth: La Saint-Jacques. Scallops royal with chive emulsion and buckwheat tuile. Review: Incredible scallops. Best I've had by far. Sixth: Les Crustaces. Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage, Sea urchin, potato puree with a hint of coffee, coral and ginger perfumed tea. Review: to be honest it's hard to remember each dish a week later from memory, I didn't take notes on each, although I think some people do this. The waiters didn't seem offended when I broke out the camera on a few occasions to snap pics of the entrees. If I remember correctly this was a pretty damn good ravioli. Seventh: Les Petits Pois. Light pea veloute with mint on top of a delicate sweet onion custard. Review: This was really zippy and good. My reviews are pretty Simpleton I know but I'm really typing out the menu more for your enjoyment than thinking my reviews will leave you speechless. Eighth: Le Thon. Smoked and seared Tuna, cauliflower, Nori and green curry. This one I remember well. Really amazing Tuna. Stunning even.  Ninth: I asked at the beginning of the meal for the Kobe beef. They said \"no problem, we'll give you whatever you'd like.\" So, here they substituted the Veal for the Kobe beef I asked for. It was of course real Kobe beef, and it was tender as can be and rich in flavor. I won't say it was the best cut of beef I've ever had as I'm a fan of great steakhouses, but this was serious beef and I can't say anything bad about it. Tenth: Les Pousses de Soja. Soy beans cooked risotto style with lemon zests and coriander. A very small risotto that was nice after the heavier courses and was excellent.  Eleventh: Dessert time. L'Acai. Red fruits granite, fresh raspberry and yogurt sorbet. A very pretty raspberry yogurt sorbet that was good, but not a total knockout. Beautiful presentation of course. Twelfth: Le Caramel. Caramel cremeux infused with Arabica, chocolate rice souffle. This was awesome. Even better though, the wife doesn't like fruity desserts, so she sent hers back. They were very apologetic and were not offended in the least. Shortly after, they brought out a dessert for her that could not have been any more to her liking. It was as if they knew everything about her. They brought her a fresh strawberry (I think it might have been in a light strawberry sauce), then poured white chocolate on it at the table. The strawberry dish was swirled in cotton candy, her favorite. She was, pardon me for saying so (and sadly not a result of my doing), orgasmic. Think of the Meg Ryan scene in \"When Harry met Sally.\" That was her eating her dessert, and that scene, aptly captured on my new Flip camcorder, was worth the price of admission alone. Thank you Joel Rubuchon for a truly amazing experience.",

    "text": "Robuchon was the first 3-star michelin my wife and I had been to (Daniel in NYC only recently attaining their third star).  However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.  Our standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.    The main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure.    The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.    Overall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.",

They are incredibly beautiful... I would have taken pictures but the server (from france or something) was a bit of a snob. For how much you pay I think that a kinder staff would be a little more important. I mean, we get it... this is one of the best restaurants in America. Service is just as important as the meal. The atmosphere was really rich and pretty... with all of the dramatic purple everything. It was a lot of fun!",

    "text": "My hubby & I reserved dinner at 8:30PM at this French restaurant. I have read positive reviews from food/restaurant magazines and also watched him with Anthony Bourdain's TV show. (note: we stayed for FREE 3 nights at ARIA--that's another review).  He has restaurants worldwide - Paris,Tokyo,London,Las Vegas-MGM,etc.http://www.mgmgrand.com/restaurants/joel-robuchon-french-restaurant.aspx  We went to the one inside MGM -the decor was opulent (see their website I posted) & elegant. It's not that big - but we actually prefer it that way. We were greeted by friendly staff & we sat by the back patio. We ordered half bottle of Sauvignon Blanc & hubby ordered a glass of red later with his meal).  Their bread cart was an art (very typical of fine European fine dining)-the selection was just too much in a good way. Let me tell you about the European butter-it was so tasty (slightly sprinkled with very light flaky sea salt). We ordered the pre-fixed menu - 4 courses for me ($138), hubby 5 courses ($168). Of course, that does not include the wine(s). Not a bad deal because if you order a la carte' - you will end up more than that anyway. We both had caviar presented beautifully inside canister-underneath is a layer of gelee (forgot what it was),crab meat & topped with caviar. This type of dining is not something you will do every month - that's why it is really worth splurging only for special occasion - but of course, if you can go more often - why not?  Part of my meal was lobster, split pea (reduced & poured on top--you just have to experience it--can't give justice here)..hubby had lamb..the rest in our meal were all equally presented well & also tasted good--beware though--as with this type of dining these days...the portions are not huge. Since each course was so rich & tasty--I believe you do not need large portions --else, you will be disappointed if you are expecting large portions. Europeans, particularly Paris, do not like huge portions - it's the variety, ambience, great service; are more important. Also, just having a taste of each special dish make for a good evening (or lunch).  Desserts - we were actually full - but my hubby's meal comes with dessert (I chose the pre fix without dessert because I normally get full easily and only want a taste). He had a chocolate something (it was wonderful but I apologize--I forgot the exact name). There's a dessert cart with so many varieties - bite sized-- again, this is standard in Europe fine dining establishments (but not this many selections)--I selected 4 and hubby 2--part of dinner, not an extra charge --and we had decaf with it. And at the end of the meal - I was given (all the lady patrons) a small gift in their black to go bag --a bread/dessert (full small loaf) made with cherries, pistaccios wrapped in clear purple cellophane with white bow. Nice touch. They did the same thing when we were in Paris & had lunch at Jules Verne restaurant (top of Eiffel Tower).  Overall - great restaurant & very good for dating, special occasion.  I was sorry that we did not go to his Paris restaurants when we were there in 2007 and recently June, 2010.We also missed the one in London-and we we've been in London multiple times--had I know then.... Next time......",

The selections on the menu were excellent and inventive.  The food was top notch, and everything my wife and I ordered had that \"wow\" factor. Plating of the food was also very artistic and appealing.  The executive chef, and the sous chefs, showed experience and passion in what they do best. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was pleasing to the dining experience.  As with all good things, the price reflects the quality of the product.  Do not expect to leave this restaurant without spending $300-$400 per person.  If you order wine with dinner, and after the gratuity, be prepared to see a comma in your bill for two people.  This restaurant is definitely for special occasions, or a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience.  When in Las Vegas and you don't mind \"sticker shock\", I would definitely recommend you experience this food synesthesia.",

    "text": "Volumes has already been written about Joel Robuchon's place in MGM Vegas.  I figure instead of going over the dishes again in minutae, I would just do a few \"color commentary\" things.  (I think I'm decent at being colorful!)  But to get it out of the way:  this is most definitively one of the very few places where the first taste of every dish makes my eyes water (in a good way, that is).  Every taste, every experience (the service, the variety of breads, the variety on the petit-fours cart, etc.) reminds us of how much we're paying for the experience, and how worthy that experience is of the cost.  And as Jennifer H. mentioned, the orange pound cake \"parting gift\" is simply amazing for such a deceptively simple fare.  Before we went, my wife kept harping about how Joel Robuchon won Guide Gault Millau's \"Chef of The Century\" title.  Well, I have to say that it's not even slightly arrogant or presumptuous of Le Guide to give Robuchon that award;  the man *WAY* deserves it!!  OK, here are the color comments:  The variety on the bread cart borders on tackiness:  there are twenty-something, thirty-something variations, but many are merely the same bread made in different shapes.  For example, French bread is available as regular and thin baguette, as a \"wheat sheaves\" loaf, as a roll.  Our waiter said Robuchon has three \"master bakers\" baking the bread.  The bread certainly are outstanding: wonderful taste, beautiful crumb, the crust always having appropriate texture, but TWENTY PLUS variations?  Ditto the variety of the petit-fours carts:  there must have been a few hundred different types!  OK, so maybe it was only about thirty or forty, but it was as bewildering as the bread cart.  Oh yeah, our waiter has a delightful combination of self-effacing humor (\"I'm French, but please don't hold that against me!\") and the usual French haughtiness (but only to his colleagues, and only kiddingly!).  We were there for our twentieth anniversary dinner, so we asked for a copy of the menu.  We were presented with one each, neatly rolled up and tied with a lovely ribbon.  Though we're from Texas, our appetites are not Texas-sized, so we went for the six-course tasting menu and not the sixteen-course tasting menu.  I can't *FATHOM* eating sixteen of anything and enjoying everything to the very last bite.",

    "text": "Excellent.  This was truly a dining experience and it was near perfect.  To start with, we got complimentary car service, a limo came and picked us up to take us to dinner.  We were taken to MGM through the private villa entrance (which was like a mini-oasis) gate doors opened and revelead a circle drive with a fountain, greenery, just a gorgeous setting - all this hidden somewhere in the back of MGM Grand.  Once we got to the restaurant we were asked to wait in the lounge while our table was being set.  Had two expertly prepared cocktails in a very quiet and elegant lounge.  Then onto dinner...  First ambiance...  What can I say, if you could describe what a fine restaurant should look like you still wouldn't quite reach what this place was like.  in the main dining room there's an absolutely magnificent chandelier which unless done properly could be thought of as cheesy, not here.  It's right on.  We sat in a small garden room with a perfect view of the chandelier.  The garden room has greenery on the wall, a collection of flowers, nice decorations on the tables, just beautiful.  The music volume is also perfect, just enough to make it seem like there's somethign playing in the background.  When we were led to our table, they even brought out a little stool for my wife to put her purse on.  I think that was their version of \"hello\" and it was my wife's turn to say \"You had us at hello.\"  Seriously, guys how many of your gf/wifes would completely fall for this?  Mine did.    Food...  What can I say... WOW.    L'amuse bouche was a layered concoction of caviar and crabmeat.  Excellent.  I'm a big caviar fan and definitely was about this little treat.  Just great to start off the dinner.  The bread cart is something else.  I'm not sure of how many different breads are on it, but they're all so unique and inviting.  We tried to be conservative on the bread, but failed.  It is great!  The comte cheese bread was my favorite, but there were several that were just great.  For appetizer I ordered the scallops which were perfectly prepared with a nice spiced coconut milk sauce to compliment them.  My wife ordered the King Crab, nicely seasoned, very fresh.  Also a great way to start off the meal.  For our main plates...  I ordered the guinea hen stuffed with foie gras.  I know what you must be thinking... Chicken??  I know, I know, I would rarely if ever order chicken in a place like this, but for some reason I just really thought that this choice sounded good, and man it did not dissapoint!  Ridiculous!  The hen with foie gras was a perfect combination and differing layers of consistency.  The skewer was an explosion of flavor, they called a teriyaki skewer.  Let me just say, never had teriyaki like that before.  My wife ordered the braised veal cheeks.  I was speechless after trying a bite.  Like literally, I was without speech.  Never tried meat that tender and probably never will.  Insane.  Oh and the whipped potatoes.  I'm 100% sure that the best mashed/whipped potatoes are served in French restaurants, and these may have just been the cream of the crop.  I don't even know how to describe this perfectly creamy smooth goodness, other than to say, UNBELIEVABLE.  The wine selection is vast and man there are some pricey bottles on there.  We settled for a $90 bottle of Chauteneuf du Pape de la Gardine.  Very nice bottle.  We then had a cheese course.  Very unique and excellent selection of cheeses.  They don't bring any accompanying sides (honey, apricots, walnuts, etc.) which would've been a nice compliment, but the cheeses spoke for themselves.  Again a great selection of really rare cheeses really great cheeses.  For dessert they brought us this chocolate cake surrounded by lemon cream, very interesting combination of flavors and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  Then came the dessert cart.  At this point I was seriously close to exploding I was that full, even though the portions aren't big at all, but man, they fill you up.  The dessert cart though is impossible to say no to.  So many little things to try.  It was great!  Finally at the end of the dinner the hostess led us out the same back entrance which we used to come in and at the end the grand doors opened and there stood our limo with our driver opening the door for us.  I mean seriously, this was like a scene from a movie.  I wondered if they worked on their timing because it looked perfect.  The only negative was that the service was slow, there were a couple of times during dinner where we wished someone could come by and pour us some wine or offer some more bread.  Something that should and can be fixed.  Overall however, just an amazing dinner and a great experience.  Pricey? Yes.  Worth it?  I would say for a special occasion this is a great treat and definitely worth it.",

    "text": "I realize that I do not have enough places to write about, so this is a backdated review from December 31, 2007.    This place was quite impressive and all the hype shared from my fellow yelpers was wonderful.  I don't know why anyone didn't yelp about the midget in a miniskirt under the table that made this experience worthwhile.  (joke)    Frankly, there is not much to say about Joel Robuchon that not everyone else hasn't said.    So, for our first New Years (please note this review is 7 months overdue), tina and i go to this so-called mecca to dining.  Recently awarded with the elusive third star from Michelin, it was quite the dining experience that I probably will never do again (read maybe in a couple of years or maybe at french laundry).  Sorry baby.    It's our first NYE, so we chose the 16 course menu.  15 foot doors guard the entrance to this palace and there is a sense of attention to detail that exhudes arrogance and elitism.  When I walk into a restaurant like this, I immediately feel like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman (scene where Richard Gere takes her shopping after her lousy experience and they suck up to her) (yes, i made a reference to pretty woman.  yes, it is pretty lame.  and yes, you all know exactly what i mean).  That being said, I was surprised when Tina and I walked in to check in and asked if there was restroom inside to use, and the lady lied and said, \"no\".  When she realized we were dining there, she apologized profusely on her hands and knees begging that I not chop her head off with the gladiator ax hanging on my belt.  Ok, that didn't really happen but I personally felt that she should have done that, especially since I went through the trouble of bringing my gladiator ax.  Anyway, great place.  The bread was too good, and it filled me up before I could properly enjoy meal.  There were 14 courses in between split between 6 or 7 different plates.  Honestly, too many courses, too much rich and delicious food.  Things that stood out were the sea urchin, lobster, and kobe beef were the kind of good where you can't eat another bite and you still force it down.  The dessert cart was just excess.  I know GF is reading this review and shaking her head at my poor description of the food.  Let's say, it was great and worth it.  Advice to Guys:  Only go there with someone you really care about b/c you could probably go next door to L'talier for half the price and end with the same results for some girl you are trying to impress.  Other Advice:  They offered us a glass of champagne when we sat down.  I thought it was free since I was about to blow 4 digits on a meal for two people but guess what, it's not!  Those two glasses of champagne added another $80 to our bill, which was like getting a shopping cart spoiler on an SUV.  (Read:  Completely unnecessary).",

The limo ride & walk through the mansion are a great touch, and all the various beautiful trolleys made dinner fun.    The food was great.  I wasn't a fan of the caviar amuse bouche myself (the crab salad underneath really took away from the caviar, and tasted uncharacteristically unsophisticated).  And after a few courses, while all the cuisines & preparations are unique, there is some homogeneity.  But these are very tiny things, not complaints at all, simply discussion points.  The food was excellent, and we had a fabulous time.  If you are careful, you don't get full at all--just take a few bites of each course.",

Robuchon is not just about perfection in cooking, or in combining amazing flavors in a harmonious ways. It's about discovering new flavors, by combining ingredients in previously unthought ways, producing tastes which although unprecedented, can be related to previous experiences that diners may have had, thus evoking the \"comfort\" factor which sometimes can be missed in fine-dining establishments.  Robuchon is about the new, about the perfection in everything that he does, about the rediscovery and the full, complete and total satisfaction of his customers.  This is trully the best.",

Just a short ride from the Vdara, but we never entered the casino.  You enter into the Mansion at MGM at a gated private driveway.  The mansion is breathtaking.  This place is a foodie's dream.  The service is impeccable, the food is the best ever.  We had the 4 course menu for $168.00.  Really not bad at all, but overall we ended up spending $6 bills for the 2 of us.  Pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.    The bread cart is phenomenal.  17 selections.  I managed to down 5 selections.  I could not eat any more after that, but absolutely the best bread ever.  I had the bacon fogas, milk brioche, asiago baquette, rustic olive, basil brioche.  Mmmmmmm  Good.  The butter presentation was also impressive.  The server carves a section of butter and sprinkles sea salt on it.  They also offer mr. Robuchon's olive oil.  The best olive oil I ever tasted.  So fruity and tasty.    The caviar amuse is outstanding.  The caviar was served over crab and a fennel cream.  So dang delicious.  I was in awe.  Next came the next  3 courses - Truffled Langoustine Ravioli, Le Tofu Soup, smoked eel seaweed gelee and my main course was the Roasted Lobster on pilaf rice and caramelized sea urchin with oriental essences.  I was blown away.  All of it was so good and I ate everything on my plate.    For dessert - Guanaja Chocolate Ganache, crunchy cocoa nib and acai sorbet.  Beautiful...    Then came the mignardise cart.  Oh my goodness.  I was in heaven.  Over 20 selections of the most delicious confections to choose from.  I had the nougat, caramel chocolate, macaroon, meringue, white chocolate pineapple and a couple more...    The hostess arranged for the limo to take us back to Vdara.  Such a class act.  The service staff is very nice and friendly.  They provide exceptional service, but they are not stuffy.  An amazing evening, which I will remember for a long time.",

    "text": "I will start off with why I'm taking off a star - I kept reading how they will send a limo which allows you to see the gardens/mansion.  So I asked about this and was told that they will only send the limo for a party of 2 or more.  I was going on my own as I've been wanting to go for years, one of the main reasons I went to Vegas and my friends didn't want to splurge for this restaurant.  I found this to be such a biased reason - I might understand if it was reserved for bigger parties of 4 or 6 or more.  But really?  It's that big of a difference between 1 person and 2?!  Given the amount of money you'll end up spending here, I found this a bit of a turnoff.  That being said, my actual experience at the restaurant was amazing.  The service of course was impeccable - attentive, friendly, and comfortable.  Being from CA, I went specifically for foie gras.  I believe after hearing this, the gentlemen who took my order also provided a complimentary soup course which had foie gras in it.  This made up for my lack of limo :)  I ordered the 3 course meal (amuse, app, main) and felt it was more than enough by the end of it - especially with the bread and the chocolate cart.  I don't know how people get through 16 courses!   I've dined at a number of Michelin star restaurants and definitely would rank this towards the top of the list!",

I ended up spending around $1,200 on a dinner for two by adding truffles to just about everything..  so when they say the food is expensive, it's impossible to overstate how expensive it is. That said, I wouldn't do anything different. Excellent decor, superb service, and a once in a lifetime dining experience.",

Service:  Exceptional from the moment we walked in.  Polite and inviting host team.  Our waiters were very knowledgeable and gave excellent recommendations.  The Food:  Ok, everyone agrees the bread cart is the stuff of legends.  Everything I had there was done perfectly. Each item on both menus were unique and wonderful.  The price: Expensive.  Very Expensive.  Could I have a dining experience as good for less?  Yes.  Areoles comes to mind.  I could get this experience duplicated anywhere else? NO!

They wouldn't even let us do a matching wine flight to the courses like other top restaurants routinely do.  The loaf of bread cake they gave us for dessert left us laughing, and stood as a reminder the whole weekend of how we were ripped off.    The reason it is so expensive is that they want to comp the high rollers and tell them they are getting a $1,300 meal, when in reality it should have been less than half that price.  Avoid the hype unless you are a high roller and get in for free.",

The service was top notch - - all anyone who worked there wanted to do was ensure that everything was perfect.   The food was inventive, visually gorgeous, and most of all absolutely delicious.   I had the 6 course tasting: * Foie gras and violet artichoke salad with parmesan shavings * Light chestnut veloute with foie gras, smoked lardons foam * Braised veal cheeks in Thai broth, vegetable couscous with broccoli * Pan fried turbot with lemongrass emulsion and stewed baby leeks * 6 different cheese from the cheese trolley * Fuji apple confit, cinnamon sable and Manzana milkshake  Turbot is my all time favorite fish and this was the best turbot I've ever had. The veal cheeks were outstanding and the foie gras was perfect.   The cheese trolley, along with the bread trolley was an overwhelming delight of both sight, smell and taste.   It was a 3+ hour food orgasm that I wish wouldn't have ended. Thanks mom and dad!",

    "text": "I honestly don't know where to start because our entire experience at Joel Robuchon  was exemplary from start to finish.  From the pick up at our hotel in their (omg tacky but awesome) gold limo, to the gated, private entrance at the Mansion, they started our experience in style and set the tone for the rest of the night.    I greatly appreciated that my fiancee and I were allowed to have different tasting options, as often restaurants don't allow that.  My fiancee had the degustation and I had the 6 dish-tasting menu with a few truffle supplements.  We started with cocktails that were fabulous, then the bread cart came by and the rest of the evening went about like this...  OMG...is yours this good (swap tastes) OMG...I can't decide which is better... Did that _____ just totally dissolve in your mouth? -pinch- yep I'm awake and apparently in heaven  It didn't take more than 1 or 2 courses to decide that Robuchon was competing for our \"number 1\" tasting experience.  I held out till dessert to seal the deal (I've had a few places call in dessert and mar the total experience).  But as of now, Robuchon is number one on my list and I can't wait to come back.  We took our time with the whole experience and felt like no one else was a lucky as we were as we enjoyed our ride back to our hotel in the before mentioned, tacky as heck, gold limo.",

Here's what was on the menu back then:  La Sangria:  Frosty little pearls on top of fruit juice perfumed with blood orange and orange flower water.  Le Caviar: Cauliflower jelly, rich flan perfumed with asparagus, thin slices of warm scallops with lime zest.  Les Crustaces: Truffled langoustine ravioli, lobster under warm gelee and coral jus, crawfish with with arbois sauce and baby spring vegetables.  Les Petit Pois: Light peas cream and mint on top of delicate sweet onion custard  L'Oursin: Sea urchin, potato pure with a hint of coffee  L'Amadai: Crispy amadai in a lily bulb broth  Le Bar: Pan-fried skin on sea bass with five spices served with verjus sauce  Les Morilles: Morels and green asparagus, garlic and shaved parmesan  Le Boeuf de Kobe: Grilled Kobe beef with watercress tempura, horseradish mustard  L'Epeautre: Sault farrow prepared risotto style, gold leaf  Le Punch: Old rum punch, exotic sorbet  Pom.Pom.Pom: Apple compote perfumed with vanilla and Chantilly caramel  Le Cafe ou le The:  Escorte de mignardises  Yet we all remember the bread cart selection.  Not to be missed.  Our bill came out to just around $3.6k.",

    "text": "Ahh Joel Robuchon, you're the Chef of the Century. Not to mention being the only Three-Star Michelin restaurant in Vegas, plus a Forbes Five-Star and AAA Five Diamond award. Are the accolades True or were reviewers bribed with caviar?  Las Vegas is known to have more top rated restaurants in one square mile than any other city (I'm talking concentration not quantity). So to find the one that rises above the others isn't easy. Yet Chef Robuchon has pulled ahead of his peers here.  Situated in the MGM, not the classiest of the hotels but not the worst, The Mansion is tucked off in a slower corner of the property. The slots machines still harangue you on the way there and douches of all sort prowl the floor outside. However once you enter the opulent Mansion this all fades away.  When we arrived the tall doors glided open and we were quickly guided to our seat. It wasn't busy at all and this made for a very intimate experience. The decor teeters on the edge of sophistication and gaudy but seems to work for their purposes.   We opted for the four course tasting despite my eagerness to go all out on the sixteen course degustation. This is in part due to me consuming too much of a huge sandwich at Zoozacrackers earlier in the day, MISTAKE!  It's been a few months since I dined here so I won't go into particulars about the dishes. All of them were extremely flavorful and you could really notice a delicate hand was used in their preparation. Presentation was nice but didn't have that modern wow factor you might find at other places on the strip; this is fine since the dishes seemed slightly more classical for the four course.  The real air of classiness come with the bread trolley. There is a mind boggling array of bread that you can choose from. We tried a few varieties and each was amazing. Some of the best I've had. And what do you put on bread? Butter of course, with it's own trolley! it was a sweet cream from france in the shape of a large cylinder that they would shave pieces from. It was very nice and had a great fattiness yet concise butter flavor I've yet to find again.  Upon completion of your savory dishes get ready for a visit from another trolley. This time stacked with all manners of sweets. If you're diabetic just hide your eyes and tell them to leave you alone. Each sweet was very clean in taste and very well crafted.  But wait, there's more. We received a parting gift that from my understanding varies by the season. We received a custom Joel Robuchon case filled with two varieties of fruit jellies, they were fantastic too.  The waitstaff were truly professional. They were courteous and very precise in their actions. Among the best service I've received in a fine dining experience.   Reservations were easy to get and you can even book online through MGM. Prepare you credit card with a gentle lullaby as you'll be rocking it with one of the more expensive locations in Vegas. Four courses for the two of us with a moderate half bottle of wine came to about $500 before gratuity. If you go with the degustation that will probably hit about $400 per person before drinks and gratuity. If you love food and did well at blackjack then you should take the time for a classy affair at Joel Robuchon.",

(Although, we love  the trendy ambience & tapas-sized portions of wonderfully eclectic French fusion food there.....).  We always trust 3-Michelin star restaurants to be exceptional, and it's a shame to read some of the reviews on here - I am sure if you returned after telling them about your previous less-than-expected dining experience, they would absolutely make you leave happier!  The decor is very much to our liking - very European in taste - it's classy, luxurious & contemporary, yet somehow feels \"old school\" all at the same time...you will not be disappointed with the floral & table decor, absolutely stunning every season!  Always expect at least a 3 hour dinner at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant - you are paying a lot of money for such an experience - why rush?  The 'carts' are all fantastic - breads, cheese, desserts, tea - all beautifully presented & extensive - the dessert cart takes some beating!  We always have beautiful food here - never had enough appetite for 16 courses, unfortunately, but always enjoy the various A la Carte options.  Wine list pricing is as expected.  $100 corkage per bottle. It would be very difficult to spend less than $1000/$1500 for 2 adults, if like us, you like to start with Champagne, enjoy a decent wine with dinner & opt for after dinner drinks with your cheese/dessert. If this is not for you, then L'Atelier next door is still a FANTASTIC dining experience!",

It was elegantly appointed but had some odd touches. The color scheme throughout was mismatched. The hostesses were in asian attire (french restaurant). Maybe I'm out of it when it comes to stuff like this.  The service was excellent. They were attentive and very knowledgeable. My wife spilled some of her martini (her fault) and they brought another one free of charge.   Like most upscale french restaurants, it's as if they don't feel like they've given you the full treatment if they don't keep you at least two and a half hours.  There were several dishes that were out of this world. The langoustine ravioli and the ribeye were phenomenal. There were some dishes that were good but not great. For $250 per person, it all needs to be great.  The bread options as well as the dessert cheeses were almost overwhelming in volume. I simply can't process 22 bread options and 18 cheeses.  With all the options in Vegas, it would be years before I would go back to Joel Rubuchon. Not because it's not good but because it simply isn't worth the time and cost.  Smiley face.",

The seasonings, perfection. Subtle yet potent all at once,  and ever changing. I know that doesn't even make sense. But it does. For first course I tried: the caviar topped with 24kt gold of course,  beets with green mustard,  live Maine lobster and foie gras which literally MELTED on my tongue. Main course: beef with marrow foam, Iberico pork with truffles. Dessert: a beautiful display of chocolate made to look like a mushroom in the wild. They even fashioned \"moss covered rocks\" from brandy soaked cherries rolled in pistachio powder. I sampled a berry dessert, then I picked from the cart of sweets. Last,  I had an herbal infusion tea from imported fresh cut herbs tableside.  Some of the wines are $10,000 a bottle. The bread is fresh baked daily. The butter is imported from Brittany,  France and the best I've ever tasted. Everything was the best of the best. This isn't just food, this is art. This is an experience. This is legendary.

    "text": "My analysis of the myriad of glowing five star reviews: A.) This place is the default \"most expensive food in Vegas\" so I think it attracts people who aren't accomplished in much other then spending cash. B.) When you drop 500-1200 a person on dinner it is really hard to admit that the food and experience is less the five stars.  I have enjoyed opportunities to dine at some really swanky places with prices that do command a healthy cash flow.  Joel Robuchon was by far the most overrated, unimpressive, and exorbitantly expensive meal I have ever indulged.    I guarantee if you are dropping the cash on this experience your are likely not staying at the MGM where the restaurant is located.  The MGM Grand?  Come on folks....  The place is like a goddamn amusement park and holds ranks and class with the likes of the fabulous Luxor and New York New York.  So they pick you up at your far more modern and luxurious hotel in a funky ass, old, skankafied beige limo that says \"MGM Grand on the side.\"  Right on!    Like everyone gushes, you are rolled up to some ally entrance in the back of the hotel and are ushered in to an impressive hotel that you will NOT be staying at anytime soon.  Personally, if I was dropping 5K a night to stay at this private hotel, I would be pissed off that they shuttle some two bit strip dwellers through my private space so they can ooh and ahh while strutting through.  The whole entrance thing is complete theater, at the end of your tour you are dumped out into the reality of the MGM's casino floor area.  The hotel is old, and dumpy.    The restaurant design is classic stuffy french with a large helping of schizophrenic circus flare.  Don't be put off if the hostess, captain, and most all the wait staff put on a strange stuffiness that is not warm, nor is it directly dismissive.  It is the perfect balance of cocky that makes most general, submissive diners feel they have been blessed with the opportunity to dine.    The bread cart is a complete exhibition and a method to fill patrons up on inexpensive bread.  You won't find warm, fresh bread.  Just a bunch of gimmicky ass, stale, cold pieces of herb, cheese, and bacon bread.  I ordered the full tasting menu.  In asking my options with the Sommelier, I was offered the option of three tasting costs.  Never have I been offered the option to choose my wine pairing based on cost levels.  To top it off, the price levels were some bullshit like $299, $599, or $999.  Let's just say, 300, 600, or 1000 for christ sake.  I went with the most \"modestly priced\" wine pairing and I was blown away with the swill they poured me.   The food was interesting, it was prepared well, some items were delicious however most of the 16 were just uninspired combinations of expensive ingredients.  An example was a piece of cold asparagus, cut down the middle stuffed with beluga..  Yay!  Most dishes that should have come out hot or at least warm, came out cold.  Pretty, but cold.   Dessert was ridiculously long winded, as they felt the need to review two dozen little candies on yet another cart.    My share was $900.00 and I left with a huge chip on my shoulder.  Never again.",

    "text": "Chuck Norris stared at me my whole meal, and I found it a little distracting.  Okay, he wasn't actually there, but they had a picture of him in a gaudy silver frame facing me from four feet away.   The frame was nestled in between a ridiculously over the type pink ribbon extravanganza easter display.  It's like they said - hmm, we have a beautiful Easter set up, but it's too tasteful.  Let's add pictures of Chuck Norris and Kirstie Alley.  And more ribbon.  That should give you some sense of the aesthetic of the place.  It's over the top.  Way over the top.  The food follows suit.  That's what makes it awesome, and disappointing. Awesome in that you'll have twenty five different types of bread to choose from, thirty chocolates, an amuse bouche that's crazy caviar, aspic, crab, yummy.  Disappointing because frankly sometimes there's just too many flavors on your plate.  It's like the chef just can't stop.  It's like he showed every dish to some Vegas person in charge who said, hmm, that dish is pretty good already, but why don't you add five more ingredients.  The sommellier was bit of a jerk too.  I asked for a bottle that was light, dry, crisp and could go with lamb or chicken and was under $65.   (They had at least 4 per page of their 25 page wine list).  He mentions a $90 and $105.  I reminded him of my price range and then  he said, \"Yes, but these are much superior.  The others aren't worth it\". Really? Then why do you have them?  I get it - they have a lot of expensive wines that are amazing, and they want to encourage me to splurge and expand my horizon. But come on, I mean, I've asked the same question at Per Se and Le Bernardin, and gotten them to give me great recommendations in the same range.   The rest of the staff was lovely.  The service is excellent.  And generally the meal was really pleasant.  I'd have given it five stars even with the jerky wine guy. BUT, the food just seemed to disappoint - every course was interesting, but there was always something that felt like too much.  Like Chuck Norris, it's just a little distracting. With decorations, I don't mind the extra, but with my food, sometimes 6 or 7 ingredients in a dish should be enough.",

I can't think of one bad thing to say about this place.  Oh wait, the amuse bouche.  A cherry tomato gazpacho, I believe.  Not that great and I do like tomatoes but I guess I was expecting something a bit more spectacular.  Other than that, everything was amazing!  The whole experience was fantastic!  And we got to sit in the smaller room with a huge wall of ivy, which was cool.  Ordered the 4 course dinner:  La Langoustine - truffle langoustine ravioli So full of flavor!  Le Daikon - daikon mousseline with foie gras and morels It had foie gras in it!  Need I say more?  Le Canard - Roasted duck & seared foie gras with cherries and kumquat compote Foie gras AND duck together!!  This dish was like heaven!  Le Souffle - Dark chocolate hot souffle This was the lightest, fluffiest souffle I have ever had but full of rich, dark chocolate flavor.  I would recommend all of those.  In fact, if you go, just order exactly what I did.  :)  Oh and don't forget the amazing bread cart and candy cart.  It's hard to not want one of everything on each of those carts.  I swear that was the BEST macaron I have ever had!",

First of all, the dining room is very intimate and you feel like you are in someone's home dining room.  The service was off the charts great.  I have eaten at Jean Georges in New York and the service is like comparing an Appleby's to a fine restaurant.  Everyone on the staff was friendly, professional, and knew everything on the menu in the utmost detail.  Lastly, and most importantly; the food.  Incredible.  My wife and I each did the tasting menus that included an amuse bouche, appetizer, bread cart, main course, cheese cart, and sweets cart.  Everything was perfectly prepared and presented.  This was a food event. If you can swing it, it should not be missed.",

We had a great experience from our being brought into a beautiful oasis inside the MGM to our gift of lemon pound cake at the end of the night.  We have eaten at only 1 other 3 star restaurant the French Laundry in Napa and wanted to try another.  Our dinner and service was excellent.  We had the 7 course tasting and were going to get the cheese and loved they they confirmed at the time if we still wanted the course as we were full, we knew dessert was going to be great so passed. next time we will get the smaller menu and add the cheese,  The dishes were presented beautifully and were excellent.  The stand outs were the Foie Gras and artichoke, king crab salad, beef cheeks, lobster and the buttery potatoes   The bread cart was very special with the beautiful butter and olive oil. It was hard not to over indulge in the bread.  At the end I had the chocolate souffle and my friend had a panne cotte.    The cart of treats at the end was a lot of fun and our waiter had a twinkle in his eye as he told us about the 40 desserts on the cart. We only sampled a few.  The pound cake came home with us and we ate it 2 days later. The butter kept it moist.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars as the French Laundry was the gold standard of service and food for me.",

    "text": "The 16 course tasting menu was \"Heaven on Earth\"!   My wife and I were felt taken care from beginning to end.  The entire Joel Robuchon experience began with the complimentary limo ride from our Hotel.  As you depart your limo to the private entrance of  \"The Mansion\" at MGM, you are greeted by several members of the staff.  The first thing you notice is the attention to detail.  One staff member's responsibility is to escort you as you travel from The Mansion through the secluded entrance of the hotel to Joel Robuchon.  There are nice \"handoffs\" between members of their staff, so you always feel like you're being taken care of.   We had a 6:00pm reservation, and when we arrived we were seated immediately.  When I had made my reservation, I had indicated that we were celebrating my Wife's birthday and I requested a private corner table.  To my splendid surprise, they were able to accommodate and we were seated in one of the dining rooms off to the side of the main dining room.  The decor was very beautiful!  There were ivy plants growing along the tall wall and a large bed of flowers.   Now...on to the food. I highly recommend the 16 course tasting menu.  The nice thing to note about this fine establishment is that not everyone in your party needs to order the same thing.  My wife knew she could not get through 16 courses, so she opted for the 6 course a la carte menu (still $195).  I, on the other hand, selected the 16 course tasting menu.  At $395, this is by far the most expensive meal I have ever paid for, but then again how often do you get the chance to dine at one of the most renowned restaurants in the world.  Every single dish was done to perfection.  I have to say that the staff was very attentive and my wife and I never felt that they were eyeing us like hawks.  They were not intrusive at all (unlike what some reviewers have mentioned).    I am actually glad that our reservations were early because if you choose the 16 course menu, you will be there for a while.    From the amuse bouche, to the elaborate bread cart, to the courses themselves, and the desserts at the end, I have to say there is not a single thing I can complain about.  In fact, because I had mentioned it was my wife's birthday when I made the reservation, they even came out with a cake and candle for her!  We didn't get the entire cake, but they gave us 2 slices (on the house)!  When we completed our dining experience, we were escorted back through the hotel to The Mansion where we had entered and into the limo back to our hotel.   Bottom line:  most expensive meal I have ever had, but well worth every penny!",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is a meticulous, very high quality restaurant with 3 deserved Michelin stars and I've been here twice. But the only things I remember vividly are the satin ottomans for your purse, the incredibly rich and delicious chestnut veloute we had one time, and the bread cart. Oh, what a bread cart! When they rolled it towards me, my heart almost skipped a beat in excitement. So many miniature baguettes and rolls! The mignardises cart and cheese cart are also impressive, but the bread cart was first and really stuck with you. I would have taken a photo but I was awestruck. Skip the wheat bread options, they weren't as good as the others.  Be prepared for the service to be impeccable and the food expensive, but you know what you're getting into if you make a reservation here. And if you do have a reservation and aren't staying at the MGM, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by NOT calling them and asking for the complimentary limo pickup for dinner. When I asked how I would know it was my limo up front, I was told \"You'll recognize it. It's gold.\"  And gold it was, or closer to champagne colored. It takes you into the back entrance of the MGM and pulls up in front of a fountain like some reality tv dating show and you are greeted by a woman in black with very good posture that you follow. I'm pretty sure her entire job consists of escorting back entrance limo diners through the hotel past the high roller rooms to deposit them at the restaurant.   The inside dining room looks like it was designed by Lila Fowler, all gold and lush purple and lavender silks and velvets, and the aforementioned purse ottoman.   I'm sure we ate some kind of delicious seafood or meat with expertly arranged small sides but it's all a distant dream now. The sommelier was excellent and recommended very good affordable wines to go with our courses. I also remember the freebie gift box they give you at the end of the meal. We received boxed and beribboned JR jellies that were like the fanciest Sunkist Fruit Gems known to man.  As an added bonus, I met the chef there on my birthday and we chatted for a moment in French and poses for a photo together. He was very gracious and wished me bon anniversaire.  I'd rate Joel Robuchon 5 stars for quality, service, ambiance, and details and 4.5 stars for the food, which was elegant and expertly prepared classical French but ultimately not that exciting for how expensive it was. And it was expensive. If you opt for wine or any of the supplements like truffles, it'll add up fast. Be prepared to drop some serious Benjamins.",

    "text": "There is no question or doubt in my mind that Joel Robuchon deserves nothing less than five stars and is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.  Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Joel Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent decor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.

There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the caneles and macarons.  Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Buf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphere, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Souffle is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.  Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.  After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.

They went out of their way to make it an exceptional experience, including a personalized birthday cake.  Most recently I was there with 5 other friends on August 30th. They again, made it a wonderful experience. The first time I had gone the limo ride and tour of the mansion weren't available because of a concert, but this time we got the full treatment. The mansion is beautiful, and this is really the only way to get to see it!  When we arrived they had set up a private room for us, which was a nice touch. The food was as always excellent, and we walked away paying about $350 each with tip, which is actually a bargain for Robuchon. I had spent nearly a grand when I took my partner last year.   This place is pricey, but it is one of only ten 3 star Michelin restaurants in the country. A 3 star, means it is not just dining, but an experience. Worth every penny if you can afford it.",

I have never had food look so good and have so little flavor. It was like a restaurant museum. It made me sad since I had been looking forward to it. The sommelier didn't explain the wine pairings, how they complemented the dishes, where they were from or their characteristics. They were lovely and made a substitute dish for my husband but then couldn't tell us what it was. I rarely write reviews but this was disappointing.",

The food is of high quality with fresh ingredients and beautiful presentations.  Be sure to get the tasting menu if you are here for the first time and want a broad over view of the menu.  The interior of the restaurant is well shielded from the casino; no noise or smoke odor.  Looks decadent like the menu, but that is what you are going for.  It does live up to its name, 3 stars, and reputation.",

Me and three of my friends ( one came here before) , we decided to have 15 courses and totally price come out $600 each person. I 've been to many 3 stars restaurants and used to work in the kitchen as a chef, foods here are absolutely delicious and presentation in each dish is so beautiful. The reason that I reduced one star because of service , they didn't change the utensils when we finished the first course , my wine finished and no one pour to my glass also I feel  a bit racist and a bit look down ( we are Asians) and they managed to sit all the Asian people zone( hostess seated the couple of white and they already ordered after that they whisper to the waiter and then they change their table to the next zone that I noticed that only white people sit there). Finally the dessert car come ,they didn't allow us to pick ( one of my friend that came here before told me that you can pick whatever you want and they will give you a loaf of bread for souvenir that is the best past) but we didn't get that( why???). Bottom line I might come here with high expectation and this dinner is the most expensive of my life so I need the great memory.",

I brought a friend who wanted to cancel, because he did not like French food. When we walked out, he commented that this was the best meal he has ever had and experienced. We opted for the 15 course menu, where each course only topped the previous course. Starting with the freshly shaved butter table side and the house made rolls of multiple variations. This is a do not miss restaurant when you visit Las Vegas. One last note, you must wear long sleeved dress shirts. This is not a casual restaurant.",

    "text": "MOST EPIC MEAL IN MY LIFE!!  Okay, little disclaimer: I came here back in 2010, when I was young & much more easily impressed (this was my 4th Michelin-star restaurant and my 1st 3-Michelin star), sooo this review might not be the most accurate haha, but it is still by far the most epic meal/dining experience I've had.  I actually booked this place as a celebration dinner for my then-bf (yes, call me #1 gf! hahaha jk) planning to order just the regular 3 or 4-course menu, but once we got here, the 16-course degustation menu seemed too epic to pass up on, so we got that instead and I def do not regret :)  So my memory might be faded, and this is pre-smartphone times, pre-foodporn times, and pre-foodieGrace times.  Standouts: 1)  Decor was gold, purple, sparkly with shells/starfish on the table, 100% Grace-style, big plus!! lol 2)  CAVIAR (lots of it!!) amuse bouche (first time I actually loved caviar) 3)  Bread & dessert cart: you get to choose your own, however many u want, the Mignardises cart won me over big time, I was NOT shy with choosing all the ones I desired (10-15 at least haha) 4)  Complimentary LIMO service with reservations: you HAVE to get this (u need to ASK for this, they don't just offer it), it's part of the whole experience, and makes paying big bucks for your meal more justified lol...MGM is not such a nice hotel, but man, the villa with big gates they bring you in from was not what I was expecting at all!! just do it!! there is an escort waiting at the door to take you inside and escort you out, as much as I prefer rating the FOOD, I must say they sure know how to make you feel super special!  Service is impeccable, presentation is amazing (yes, u get gold flakes on your food haha), meal takes about 4 hours. $500 (tax/tip included) per person without any add-ons or drinks (has gone up since). For birthday/anniversary celebrations, they bring out a whole small cake for u! At the end of the meal, they give you a little personalized diploma with the 16-courses, very useful since there is no way anyone can keep track of all those dishes. And ladies get a goodie box to take home.  4 years & 31 Michelin stars later, all I can say is CAN SOMEONE PLS BRING ME BACK so i can update my review more accurately!! :P",

Needless to say, when the opportunity arose, I took it.   Joel Robuchon + Free? It doesn't get any better than this..   or so I thought.   I wanted so badly to LOOOOOOOOVE the place because I was dying to come here. I enjoyed the experience and the presentation of the plates were impressive, but the food was just mediocre. For the price my boss paid for our meal, i expected it to blow my mind, sadly... it did not.  We ordered the $385 16 course prixe fix menu when they brought out the first dish I was thinking \"that's it!?\" but by the end of the course, I wanted to be rolled out the restaurant.  Not quite the place to bring out your camera to take pictures of the food, but I did anyways. (Most of the courses are posted)  Once your first course comes out, the wonderful bread cart comes out. You pick and choose from the wide selection of bread they have. [possibly another reason i was full from the meal]   Don't say I didnt warn you, but when your first course comes out, you will probably think.. \"that's it?!\", but trust me, by the end of your 16 courses, you will want to get rolled out of the restaurant.   At the end of the course,even after the desserts, the ladies get a bag that has  little box of desserts in it. Guess Mr. Roubuchon loves the ladies.   Food - 3 Stars Service -  4 Stars Presentation - 4 Stars  Overall, best part of the night was the dessert cart and the bread cart but I could care less if i went back there.",

    "text": "OMG, this was one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my life. If it's not #1, it is most certainly in the top 3. Not for the faint of wallet and if you're starving when you go in, you might walk out hungry because the portions are tiny.  Exquisite presentation. Each dish looked like a work of art. In fact, the whole restaurant was like a work of art. It's beautiful with rich woods and sparkling glass (we did some of that sparkling lighting, in fact!) and rich natural oranges from things like baby bell peppers.  Many of the dishes were presented in glass, but lava rock and beautiful ceramic also factored in. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the flatware. The spoon was too narrow and too deep and the knife was hard to decipher in terms of which end was up. But those are such tiny quibbles and took nothing away from this extraordinary meal.   The L'Amuse Bouche was foei gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam and was one of the most exquisite things I have ever tasted. If I died with the taste of that on my lips, I think I'd die happy. Layers of rich flavor ranging from the beefy to hints of chocolate or raspberry even though I'm sure there was nothing sweet or fruity in there other than the port. Sex in a glass.   The first real course came out and was indecipherable.  It was a clear, thin, and gelatinous layer of something with micro-chives and some other seasonings visible. It was langoustine carpaccio with roasted poppy seed dressing. RAW thing-which-is-neither-shrimp-nor-lobster. I timidly tried a bite. Salty ocean with little bits of pure joy in the form of who-know-what-seasoning. Not too salty. Not at all fishy. It was a revelry in my mouth.  Then, 3 poached baby kussi oysters with french echire butter. In the shell and presented like raw oysters on the half shell on a bed of salt, sprinkled with pink peppercorns. I don't normally like cooked oysters. I prefer them raw. But each of these oysters was an explosion of flavor. The first taste on the palatte was similar to eating a raw oysters...clean ocean briny but the finish was long and buttery and in between was a symphony of other rich flavors.  Next dish grossed me out badly. Egg cocotte topped with a light mushroom cream. Think raw egg omelet. Blech.  Truffled cappuccino of pumpkin with chestnuts looked a bit like a cup of cappcuccino, though the main resemblance was a foamy top of milk. No coffee here. This was kind of a pumpkin soup with little chunks of chestnuts. Lovely.  Slightly smoked salmon served with warm watercress and crispy potatoes. Wonderful in the tiny portion that arrived at my table. Slightly smoked really meant raw salmon that had been barely put into a smoker. I don't usually like raw salmon but this was luscious. It was a thin piece, with some kind of buttery sauce on it with microgreens watercress. But it had these little oniony, crispy shavings on top that made the whole thing come together.  Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled mashed potatoes was back to swoony ecstasy. This was 3 tiny bites of savory, rich, OMFG I have no clue what's on there but YUM. The sauce was reminiscent of the l'amuse bouche',  not a coincidence since they both had tiny bits of foie gras in them.   Banyuls wine gelee, pear sorbet and crunchy ginger bread was another explosive highlight of the meal. The flavors were complex with hints of spice like cinnamon and warm ginger, sweetness from the sorbet and robust and complex wine flavors melded together into a desert I could really live for. I'm not usually a big dessert person. I often eat dessert at swanky restaurants. But unlike some people, I don't live for it. But this...it was similar to the experience of drinking some really exquisite wine. Wine with long legs. Wine that awakens every sensory experience and takes you on a journey with a beginning, middle, and long ending. Wow!  Hazelnut cremeux, fresh mango, and coffee caramel streusel would not necessarily have been my first desert choice. But this thing hit the spot. The hazelnut came in the form of another foam and had chocolatey overtones (again, stuff I dont' usually like), blended with caramel and tiny bits of real mango made this one of the more outstanding desserts I've ever had.  I'm out of room to write. I know that sounds like a ton of food but the portions were so tiny I wasn't even full. Still...I'd go back in a heartbeat!",

If you like to be pampered with good food, good wine, good service and good looking young waiters (LOL), come here for all the above :)  You will not be sorry - the only person who wasn't attractive was the uppity French chef who was throwing attitude around the open kitchen lol.

I don't think this is a good place for big groups considering most seating are around the bar countertops overlooking the open kitchen and I believe, if I'm not wrong, the few tables around could seat no more then parties of four.

You may think you are being dropped off at the Casino door where all the limos and taxis go, but no. Instead, you are taken to a special mansion-like entrance, where the doors automatically open for you and a person is already waiting for you. And you know they are waiting for YOU specifically when they address you by your name. And they continually add little details like this throughout the night to make you feel special.  You wait by the fountain, with the whole beautiful courtyard to yourself. It is a beautiful location, and a wonderful way to relax and start your evening. They then walk you to your table when it is ready.  Then, your dining experience begins. You pick your course, choose your items, and enjoy the culinary adventure. Trays of items are wheeled to your side, where you select items such as breads, cheases, or truffles throughout the meal. Each and every course was delicious. And the service is wonderful. Attentive and understanding. There to ensure you enjoy your night.  One of my favorite memories from Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I almost didn't keep this reservation since I was interested in doing other things and had already splashed on food this week. But after a long day I felt like I needed to stay faithful to the vacation part of my trip. When I got there I had already decided not to do the tasting menu; I wanted a normal meal and I didn't want to feel fit to burst at the end of it.   The decor in the place is great -- very dark and though highly stylized, also unassuming in a certain way. You don't feel like part of a spectacle if you are alone. I was seated next to a lady and her son and we talked the whole time; they ended up sharing his birthday cake with me. You don't necessarily have to feel you must interact with your neighbor though. There were people on the other side of me  who were having a perfectly fine time and I don't even remember anything about them.  The service is interesting -- the waiters, hosts, sommaliers, and servers are all behind the bar. It looks crowded at times but it's an interesting show.   I decided to have the lobster salad and hangar steak. They were both wonderful -- I will always remember them. The salad was a large amount of lobster formed in a perfect circle on top of chilled, dressed lettuce, with the claw meat sticking out at the sides. Very pretty and the sherry dressing was just right on the sweet tender lobster - a bit of zest but not too overwhelming while supporting the sweetness of the lobster. This wasn't too rich. I  had a glass of Sancerre with it.  The hangar steak was highly memorable. I don't eat much red meat and I knew just what I craved in a steak that night, and it was perfect. Just the right size, seared perfectly on the outside with delicate carmelized shallots on top. I hear the hangar steak is not a common cut any more, but it's perfect - no bone and just the right amount of marbelized fat, very tender and easy to finish off. I had a cotes du rhone with this.  At the end, my neighbors shared a huge raspberry tart they gave the son for his birthday. A lovely layer of shortbread with just these big fresh birthday berries arranged atop -- the berries were huge and actually tasted like delicious raspberries (these days so many berries look great but taste like nothing).  I also enjoyed the chocolate pudding dessert at the end. I can't recall the exact name but I'll add it later. Essentially it was a mousse with a blob of delicious vanilla ice cream in the center, and they literally smashed up oreos and formed them into a dome on top of the ice cream. On the oreo dome was a round sheet of thin chocolate glazed with gold and dotted with yellow and red fruit puree which looked like jewels. There were also crispy bits of chocolate wafer at the very bottom of the dish.  I think almost anyone could find something to like here. The question is would the service, atmosphere, and definitely top standard preparation of the food really justify the price. I can't answer that for anyone else - I might consider going back here with friends. The thing I have a harder time with than paying that  much for food (because the ingredients and preparation *are* top quality and the service *is* excellent) is the wine actually. Two glasses of decent affordable by the bottle wine were 40 dollars, and I could buy both bottles and perhaps a third for that much at Bev-Mo. Alchohol is of course  a profit center for restaurants and it was a fine accompaniment to the meal, but I just don't quite get the point of driving the cost of a meal up nearly 50% with pretty much nice table wines. Other gourmands may disagree.",

The surcharge on the soup course was unexpected considering that I had clearly informed them while choosing my tasting menu that I was not choosing that option. I would still go back again!",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best meals I have ever eaten in my lifetime.  Kudos, standing ovation to the chef of the century Joel Robuchon.  Please try this restaurant at least once in your lifetime.  It should be anointed as the temple of culinary greatness.  First of all, the room is spectacular...every piece of furniture has this pleasant light purple color and the room is spectacular.  The service is top-notch and starts when you enter the restaurant till you exit the restaurant.  It is run like a well-oiled machine; every server, manager knows their task and does it to clockwork perfection.  In terms of the food...i don't know where to start..first the carts of food are amazing...the most extensive bread cart I have ever experienced in the states (of course 3 star michelin restaurants in paris have this)...over 20 types of different breads to choose from...The butter which is scooped off with a spoon is so soft and fluffy.  I chose the four course tasting menu that was diving..the highlight of the night was the signature lobster dumpling with truffles..the lobster was cooked to perfection and the bite on the lobster was crispy and the flavors were dazzling.  Each dish is a work of art in terms of presentation.  Please save room for Robuchon's signature creamy potato..although they only give you a spoonful..it is one of the richest, smoothest, and creamiest potatoes you will ever have.  This place even has A TEA CART..i got fresh lemon verbena tea leaves cut from a plant that was on the cart!  The dessert cart is amazing...i felt like charlie in the chocolate factory.  Overall a 3-4 hour experience that I want to live over and over again like groundhog's day.  Highly recommended and I would give 10 stars if I were allowed!! Perfection that's all I can say!",

    "text": "I may have come down with a bit of extremely high expectation fever.  As fabulous as the meal was, I just could not get around the awesomeness-to-value ratio.  I'll explain..  A limo, albeit a dated one, will retrieve you from any reasonable location and quickly bring you to the Mansion entrance.  As you are escorted through the more private entrance, you get a glimpse of the higher-than-high limit tables and the equally impressive Mansion lobby.  Arriving at Robo, we were immediately greeted by name and seated in the main dining room, complete with purple sofas and yellow flowers.  Already set in our decision to max out on the food, we went with the 16-course degustation.  The menu is pretty consistent with the brochure provided at the end of the meal, and with all the blogs and foodie websites chronicling this place to death, I won't rehash the dishes.  I will note that the cherry gazpacho, caviar, lobster, soybean risotto, and mignardises courses were our favorite and absolutely blew our minds.  Choose your mignardises carefully as there are 45 of them, but only so much that can fit on your plate, although I'm sure that you could ask for more if you are so inclined.  We passed on the wine as we felt that would have put us over the food coma edge.  Final thoughts:  The presentation and whimsical creations wowed me, and nearly caused me to forget to taste what I was eating.  Thankfully the 16 courses aren't individually presented, otherwise it could have taken all night to eat.  I'm not a critic and certainly not the committed foodie like some others on here, but I couldn't help but notice how relatively disappointed I was after we had dropped over a grand and able to reflect on that meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed and savored every single bite, but still do not believe that as a whole it was 33% more satisfying than the French Laundry.  4 and 1/2 stars for the experience of a lifetime.  The meal was truly on another level, but my next trip to Vegas will not include Robo.  Perhaps the one after that..",

The highlights: the bread cart and the incredible butter and olive oil offered, fois gras cooked to perfection, lobster with chestnuts (not something you typically see combined together but tasted great!), mashed potatoes, and an incredible cheese cart.  Don't get me wrong, each course was delicious but those were the stars! We had the Sommelier do a wine paring with our meal and it was well worth the cost!  How can you settle on one bottle with so many variances between courses. Our only regret is by the time it came to dessert we were so full that we skipped that course. So, just when you think you can't eat one more bite, here they come with a \"candy\" cart, and of course you have to try a few things.  The service was impeccable!  Would love to eat here again! If you have the opportunity to eat here, do it!",

    "text": "*Edit: I've been trying to pinpoint the word to describe my experience at Joel Robuchon, but I could never quite find it until now.   GAUDY.   That's the word. From the decor (the giant black vases, the flagrant center chandelier, the shimmeringly uneasy purple velvet couches) to the way the dishes were plated (does every plate have to be painted with gold dust? I felt like I was at a jewelry store instead of a restaurant), to the interesting, but slightly obnoxious, somewhat pretentious gold foil sheets laid atop our truffle risottos (well, at least I can say I've shitted gold now). Gaudy.  In terms of three star restaurants, the French Laundry completely trumps this place. I was going in expecting nothing less than stellar after seeing Michelin's reviews of this being the only 3-star restaurant in Las Vegas. Where do I even start?   First of all, their bread, cheese and candy carts. Okay, this is interesting. they have about 30+ different types of breads, cheeses and candies for you to choose from. While this might have seemed impressively novel in theory, I was left paralyzed by choice. And when you're having a 16 course meal, do you really want to fill up on bread anyway? Again, novel, but unnecessary.   Despite the strong asian influences in their tasting menu that night (going to a french restaurant, i was expecting classic french food. being chinese, if i wanted asian food i'd ask my mom to cook something for me.), I still thoroughly enjoyed the first few courses.   Their trio of lobster, langostine and sea urchin was by far their most memorable dish. Coffee potato puree? Exquisite with the sea urchin. I couldn't marvel enough about how well these flavors were put together. Until they brought out the pan seared scallop. This scallop was actually slightly overcooked. It was rubbery. Then this abomination of a piece of seabass came out. There was nothing wrong with this piece of fish mind you. It was well cooked. HOWEVER, this \"verjus\" sauce they drenched it in was utterly offensive. The last time I tasted something this sour was when I was a child eating super lemon candy. At first, I thought maybe it was supposed to taste like that. After all, what do I know, I'm not some expert food critic. But after the waiter mentioned it to be \"sweet, with a hint of bitterness\" I had something to say.   The later dishes blurred together with the taste of black truffles. Being winter, truffles are in season, and Joel Robuchon took full abuse by deciding to put a little truffle into every other dish. Don't get me wrong, I love truffles. But by the end of the savory courses, my mouth was permanently infused with the taste. And let me tell you, it was slightly irritating. I now understood the importance of palate cleansers. Luckily a sorbet came just in time to rid my mouth of the taste.   Overall, their tasting menu that night was quite heavy. Some of the flavors were too overwhelming. And while their were some exceptional dishes that I loved, I wouldn't have expected less from a Michelin 3-star restaurant. Ultimately, the dishes that I mentioned above seemed to undermine the entire experience.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon definitely ranks up there with the best meals I have ever had.  Unlike the other famous chef I tasted the day before, this one lived up to the hype in spite of the extraordinary expense.  Consider me a new fan.    All reservations to the restaurant include a limo pick up from other hotels on the strip.  We were picked up promptly by the MGM Grand limo and dropped off at the entrance to The Mansion part of the MGM - an exclusive all-villa section of the hotel.  A hostess arrived shortly to escort us through a pleasant walk to the restaurant.    The restaurant itself is located just off the casino floor but it is walled off from the noise.  While nicely decorated, it wasn't overtly so.  Subtle.  My wife commented that it was more understated than she expected but I didn't mind.    Onto the food!  We decided that we would have enough food if I ordered the Four-Course Menu and she ordered Two-Course Menu.  A Two-Course sounds like very little but in actuality, we ended up being stuffed and we are both healthy eaters.  We really have no idea how people could finish the Degustation Menu and its 16 courses.    L'Amuse-bouche - It was a crab salad topped with a giant layer of caviar.  Easily the most decadent amuse-bouche I had ever eaten!  The crab and caviar go so well it was pure ecstacy.    Appetizers: Salmon tartar with shiso sprouts and caviar (and a gold leaf) - It may have been the best tartar I've ever tasted.  The chef does a good job of mushing(?) the salmon and blending it with the other ingredients so that the texture is extra smooth.  The gold leaf, while flavorless, just adds to the opulence of it all.  A great start.    King crab, avocado in a heart of romaine seasoned with coral-virgin olive oil - This was the only \"mistake\" of the meal.  The crab was overcooked and seasoned in a way that could only be described as confusing.  Where's the sweetness of the crab?  That pretty much kills it but then you also get a giant mush of mayonnaise sauce that is spooned all over what appears to be a hodge podge of chopped salad ingredients plus a few giant pieces of avocado.  This dish was poor but Chef Robuchon's other dishes more than made up for this.    Warning to others: do NOT order the King Crab appetizer.    Soup: Delicate chestnut veloute with foie gras, smoked lardons foam - A foie gras soup!  I'm a bit \"over\" the foam thing - doesn't add much to the taste other than looks cool but the flavors in this soup are perfect.  Add to this a few pieces of foie gras and you have perfection.  The portion is perfect small portion.  I loved it.    Entrees: Spiny lobster with daikon radish and nori, coral nage - This dish is everything that the king crab dish was not.  Cooked perfectly - lobster was just barely cooked to the center.  Flavored perfectly - seasoned but in a way that you could still taste the freshness of the lobster.  And the pairings were a great complement to the lobster.    Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour winter fruits, grapefruit zest and cracked black pepper - Pretty standard dish and well executed.  Nothing to get too excited about here especially since the foie gras was actually a bit overcooked.  Sad, but True.  We've had better.  But this was still very, very good.    Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers (Supp. Kobe Beef $30) - I paid the extra $30 for the kobe and it was worth every penny.  I was lucky enough to be able to compare this to Bar Masa's kobe beef skewers that I had just the night before and they are similar.  The preparation results in different flavors but Chef Robuchon's dish wins for me.  The beef was just absolutely perfect.  Each bite results in juicy, melt in your mouth goodness.  I could eat this dish forever.    Also, the entrees are served with the most perfect mashed potatoes.  Very rich so they're not for everyone but they are so smooth and so tasty.  Cheese selection: I chose four cheeses (although you can choose more.  They had a wide selection and cheese lovers will love this section of the meal as I did.    Dessert: Fresh aloe and passion fruit granite, layered over cheese cake - The simplest was to describe this is that it's like \"fancy taiwanese style shaved ice.\"  It's good and very light.   The couple sitting next to us were celebrating a birthday and they got a cake.  It was large enough they decided to share it with us!  It was a lemon cake of some sort and probably the best I'd ever had despite not being much of a lemon cake person.  Very light.    Along with dessert, we were served two perfect capuccinos.  Then, as a parting gift, we were given a box of marshmallows to take home.  The box was pretty but when we went to eat it, it was pretty awful.  Passion fruit marshmellow shaped like rectangular tubes?  No thanks.    That last bit doesn't ruin it for me, though.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and though there were a few glitches, this was still easily one of my favorite meals of all time.",

    "text": "Not only have I never before eaten at a better restaurant than Joel Robuchon, I likely never will have a better meal in my life.  It is supremely expensive.  The 16 course menu for two, a bottle of wine, tax and tip was over $1100.  And it was worth it.  I will not rehash the menu here.  Other reviews have done a great job of describing it, and you can look up a sample menu at Joel Robuchon's website.  Suffice it to say, the unparalleled, meticulous attention to every last detail is what makes Joel Robuchon an unforgettable experience.    The tiny little dots of chive oil encircling the perimeter of the scallop mousse--precise artistic detail you would only expect to see on coinage.    The unflaggingly regimented service (one waiter brings your course out to a transfer table off to the side, then two other waiters do a final quality check and then deliver your dishes to you).    The trolleys!  Joel Robuchon has separate trolleys for bread (about a dozen different kinds), ice cream, and mignardises (about twenty different kinds--take as many of any or all of them as you want).    This is not a meal, it is an experience.  You will never have another meal like this.  I can't believe I spent this much money on a meal, but then again, I can actually see myself going back at some point and doing it all over again.  At the end, they send you off with a small loaf of terrifically moist and sweet lemon bread to munch on the next morning.    It was as perfect a meal as I could ever expect.  One note--The waiter advised that they don't do wine pairings.  This is not what other people had told me, and I have seen a review here on yelp that belies this as well.  Does anyone have any knowledge about this?",

Saffron brioche, yes! Cheese brioche, yes! We pretty much asked for one of everything,  and our waitress was totally willing to comply and made us a basket for the table. The butter comes off this huge block of butter and it's amazing.  Amuse bouche, split pea gaspacho (french word forgotten) with smoked duck, pistachios and mint marshmallows.  Delicious.  Cold appetizer,  artichoke with fois gras. The perfection of the textures of these two foods together is something to write home about. Because it was textural bliss.  Hot appetizer,  asparagus soup with fresh ricotta tortelini. The tortelini were melt in your mouth, fantastic.   Main course, beef cheeks. So good. Best part? The whipped potatoes. Literally 4/5 butter 1/5 potato but somehow that just made them better, allowed me to feel like I was eating the butter from the bread cart guilt free.  Dessert, chartreuse sorbet palette cleansing and refreshing.   The dessert cart! Yes! Tiramisu,  so perfectly arranged and delicuous. Again, pretty much asked for one of everything. My favorites?  White chocolate filled with blueberry, Red velvet baby cupcakes and ladybug chocolates (they were so cute)  I think it was worth it, wish I could afford to eat like this more often.

    "text": "Very opulent, romantic, and formal.. I can understand how Joel Robuchon was awarded 3 Michelin stars in 2009. Courtesy limo service and private mansion tour before dinner - beautifully impressive, distinguishing experience. You definitely have to account for the ambiance, presentation, production value as part of your EXPERIENCE.  It will be an unforgettable pricey night for a memorable occasion. The prix fixe menu (with supplement charges) is definitely the way to go, versus the a la carte options. It was a lot of food, as we got the 6 course, and 2 course menu and shared... bread cart, 2 appetizers, 3 main courses, 1 cheese cart, 2 desserts, 2 dessert carts, half bottle of wine, 2 cappuccinos. I was sooo stuffed - I almost popped out of my XXS Herve Leger dress, at the end of the night...  The food was extraordinary in presentation, and expected to be of high quality in tastiness, creativity, and exquisiteness. I guess I found the sauces of the sea bass a bit too salty, and the imported tender veal was delicious - but NOT memorable enough to order again, or leaving me to crave it like crazy.  It was about a 4 hour production, and I will have a lasting memorable experience, but the French cuisine didn't leave me dreaming of it, nor desirable enough to want to come back again. I still personally prefer Le Cirque, and absolutely LUV and crave their seasonal risotto dishes - which keep me going back. Again it's about personal taste...  Their courtesy moist lemon loaf cake was a classy touch, in the gift bag with brochure..",

From the moment you enter the restaurant you begin to experience what a culinary masterpiece Mr. Robishon created.   It was 3 hours of dishes prepared to perfection, the platings were visually stimulating and when you tasted the meals you immediately realize the care and attention to detail by which they were prepared. Although everything was amazing to eat, I have to say that their mashed potatoes are by far in a league thier own--sounds silly but when you try them you will understand. 5 stars is not enough.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon was the choice for the girlfriend and my dinner on our first night in Vegas.  While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Joel Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never \"stuffy\" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.  Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...  La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice cream La Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gelee topped with mozzarella   Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surprise La Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander Les Crustaces - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in \"chaud-froid\" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauce Les Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mint Le Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compote Le Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks Le Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment Le Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto Le Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Rose Champagne cream and soursop sorbet Le Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.  Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le The, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.    Joel Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, \"Yes\".",

    "text": "When my husband and I decided to go Vegas a few weekends ago on a whim, I made reservations at Joel Robuchon for Saturday night.  I was pleasantly surprised that we were able to get in with short notice on a weekend.  Someone my husband knows through business always raves about Joel Robuchon, so we were excited to try it.   Please note that the restaurant no longer offers complimentary limo service to the restaurant.  I had read about this perk in other reviews, but when I called, they said that they have discontinued the service.  My husband and I both ordered the five course meal (2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 dessert), which included an amuse-bouche, the magnificent bread cart, and a gorgeous dessert cart.  Honestly, the bread and dessert cart presentations were the most impressive parts of the evening.  I am in love and fascinated with the fancy dessert cart!  It is something from my childhood dreams.  While our meals were good in general, there were a few misses.  Since it has been a few weeks, I only remember that the amuse-bouche was some kind of cream of cauliflower and caviar, which we both really enjoyed.    Appetizer 1: My husband and I both had Le Homard - Maine lobster in a thinly sliced turnip with sweet and sour dressing.  I would definitely order this again, and my husband liked it too.  Appetizer 2: My husband had the Salmon Tartare with Caviar, which had a $55 supplement, and was delightful.  I had the shaved avocado and potato from the vegetarian menu, which was good.    Entree 1:  My husband had the Sea Bass, and I had the Mushroom Ravioli with Black Truffles from the vegetarian menu.  The Sea Bass was flavorful and light.  The ravioli were actually more like pot stickers and had a lot of soy sauce surrounding them.  Very salty.   Entree 2:  We both ordered the Grilled Lobster with curry broth and spinach.  My first two bites of lobster had a really bad taste, but the last three bites tasted great.  It was disappointing.    Dessert:  My husband had the chocolate souffle ($10 supplement) which he loved, and I ordered the black forest cake.  My cake was darling, and I have attached a photo, but it was more about the looks than taste.    Service:  Service started out really strong, and it was great until about two hours into the meal when the restaurant got more crowded.  When our desserts were presented, they offered us coffee, which then took 10 minutes to receive, and our desserts were gone by the time the coffee arrived.  I know it seems minor, but the coffee with dessert timing seems so basic, and a Michelin 3 Star Restaurant should get it right.  We then had coffee, but no dessert, and they said they were replenishing the dessert cart, so we sipped on our coffee, waiting for dessert, part two, but that did not work out either.  Our server apologized, and it wasn't the end of the world, but you want a strong ending.  The tiny desserts on the cart were darling and tasty once we did have them.  The ambiance was warm and romantic.  A lovely chandelier hung overhead, and flowers were everywhere.  I think the tables are far too close together.  When we were eating our dessert, the tables on both sides of us were eating fragrant seafood dishes which took away from the enjoyment of our sweets.    It was a long and leisurely dining experience, although I cannot say it was one of my best.  Although it is the only 3 Michelin Star Restaurant I have visited, we have dined at many lovely restaurants that are highly rated and are more memorable.  Vegas has so many fabulous restaurants to try that I doubt we would go back to Joel Robuchon.  Two of our favorite French restaurants that I highly recommend are La Mer in Honolulu, Hawaii, and The Studio in Laguna Beach, California.  I cannot find a more highly Zagat rated restaurant in America than La Mer, and I truly agree with the rave reviews.  In Vegas, Cut and Delmonico's are our favorite restaurants, although they are not French.    Our dinner at Joel Robuchon was a fun night out, but I definitely think it is over priced and a bit over hyped.  For our dinner, with tax and tip, no alcohol (we do not drink), it cost $750.  It was a good evening, but not life changing.",

Different bread and dessert combination for our table of 4, server remembered exactly what we each wanted. Only delay was the main entree because we ordered the hen (whole hen) that takes a while to cook.   Food: Yes, yes, and yes. Forget whatever food you had tasted before. From the butter to the foie gras, better versions than any other place I've ever been to. The bread was just medium to transport more butter to my mouth =D.   Price: I don't drink so that affects the bill a lot. Expect at least $300 per person, this place can easily run into the thousands of dollars if you want.   Overall: Most expensive meal of my life, BEST meal of my life. Totally worth it.",

    "text": "It was mine and my boyfriends first time to go to a restaurant of this caliber, and I must say we were both thoroughly impressed. The atmosphere and decor are sophisticated as well as sumptuous. The vertical garden is quite beautiful to look at.  We were promptly greeted and seated. We ordered the Veuve Clicquot Rose for an aperitif and decided on the 16 course tasting menu.   Before I get on to the food, I first would like to applaud the staff. Absolutely impeccable service. Replaced silverware every course, glasses never empty, dishes promptly removed and replaced as well as delightful explanation on every aspect of each dish. Bravo! I doubt I will ever experience service as flawless as this ever again.   Now on to the tasting!!  The bread cart had an astonishing 11 different breads and was very tempting but I promised myself I wouldn't fill up on bread.  La Betterave- First course is a beet gazpacho with burrata and extra virgin olive oil- I have a rather love/hate relationship with beets. This dish falls on the love side. Smooth beet gazpacho, the burrata was perfect in it, creamy with a slightly salty bite. Finished every spoonful.  Le Foie gras- Second course was a foie gras carpaccio on a potato slice with Parmesan and white truffle shavings. Foie gras was absolutely delicious, very delicate and light but grounded by the potato slice. Just enough white truffle, doesn't overpower the other flavors, excellent!  Le Caviar- Courses 3-5 was caviar and was presented as a trio on a single plate. There was lemon flavored scallop with red turnip and caviar as a relish with delicate veloute of daikon, a circular tin of layered crab, seafood gelee and caviar (there was another layer but I cannot recall what it was), and caviar on a fennel cream serviced as a surprise, with edible gold flake.  L'Oeuf de Poule- Sixth course was a soft boiled egg florentine with Comte cheese emulsion and I must say this was absolutely divine! So simple but it was one if not the favorite of my bf.   Les Champignons- Courses 7-9 was mushrooms an like he caviar, served as a trio. This included a Velvet porcini veloute with jasmine rice emulsion, crispy matsutake ravioli with white truffle and a smokey mushroom tea with gold flake. This oddly enough was my least favorite part and this is odd because I am actually rather fond of mushrooms. Now I'm not saying it was bad but to me just not so much wow factor. There was a lot of white truffle and although I do enjoy the flavor, it overpowered the ravioli. The tea was unusual and unique, I did enjoy that with the subtle smokey hints. The velvet porcini veloute was also delicious but just lacking vim.  L'Oursin- #10 consisted of Uni served atop a blend of mashed potatoes, fennel and anise. The potatoes were killer and the Uni tasted fresh and was velvety smooth. I'm used to having Uni served cold ( such as in sushi) and was delighted at trying it in a warm dish.  La Langouste- Course eleven, spiny lobster roasted in a shellfish jus with julienned bell peppers and a lemon grass emulsion as well as a grilled pineapple chunk. Oh my god, heaven. Perfect balance in flavor and the lobster was like butter. One of the best plates in my opinion.  Le Bar- 12 only 4 more courses left. Pan fried sea bass with five spices served with verjus sauce. Sauce complimented the sea bass nicely, fish was flaky and moist, not over cooked in the least.  Le Boeuf- Course 13, Grilled beef rib eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment. Another corse I enjoyed immensely that rivals the lobster. Rib-eye was cooked medium-rare. Perfect! The meat was juicy and tender. I am also a total sucker for bone marrow (or God's Butter as some call it) wonderful pair with the meat. Delicious!  Le Broccolini- Course 14 Broccolini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto. I was surprised at absolutely how risotto-esque this dish was for being absent in arborio rice. Surprisingly light and the flavor was delicate and mild.  Le Carioca- The last two courses are desserts and the first of the two is a fresh papaya coulis on guava mousse, a rolled mango tuile atop a black fruits sorbet. This was my favorite if the two desserts, absolutely heavenly. The tropical flavors were perfectly in tune with one another and was accented excellently with the black fruits sorbet!   Le Chuao- Final course, big ole number 1-6. Chuao chocolate sphere filled with orange caramel, creamy dulcey. This was also a very decadent and delicious treat but after the previous dessert I was stuck on the intoxicating symphony of tropical and black fruit flavors the I admit I could not fully enjoy this dessert for what it was.  Le Moka/ Le The- This was more of a digestif course which consisted of coffee or tea and seductive sweets which are brought around on a dessert cart.  The bill was in excess of 1300, be warned this is expensive but well worth it.",

The bread cart and dessert cart alone would have been enough. The only thing I had a problem with was when they brought out the dessert menu when we specifically ordered a pre fix menu that did not include the dessert, only the dessert cart. It felt like they were trying to sneak in extra costs. When I said no to dessert our waiter said he assumed i was on a liquid diet the rest f the night and asked if I wanted coffee. Obviously i wasn't on a liquid diet if I was going to be eating off the dessert cart! That was kind of insulting but I won't take off a star for that, because over all the food was to die for.  I think we tried almost every mini dessert off the cart.  The other thing that bothered me that didn't have to do with the restaurant was the group next to us wearing jeans and farting and burping the whole time...gross and disrespectful.  Next time i would love to try the 16 course vegetarian menu.  Wonderful evening!",

The ambience and decor was very romantic although I felt I had to whisper when i was talking because it was so so quiet even with a room full of people.  We lucked out cuz it was white truffle season and 6 out if my 16 courses were generously graced with them. My fav dish was still the soft boiled egg done to perfection. It was just so perfect that I was wanting more. Will definitely be back... Although I'll prob cut down on the 16 courses next time.... Couldn't fit all that food in!",

    "text": "I am just getting around to reviewing this restaurant. My husband and I ate here back in July 2016 when we were in town for his review course. My friends told me about the amazing bread cart but honestly I was not impressed.  There is a huge selection but the bread is cold. Bread needs to be warm so that the butter can spread nicely on it. We had the 18 course tasting menu. Everything was really inventive and delicious except for when we got to the fish dish, I can't remember which dish it was,  we found bones in our fish.  That is a choking hazard!!!!  I do not expect to find bones in my food and especially not in a high end restaurant that costs so much money. We told our waiter and he was like \"oh ok.\"  Nothing ever became of it. The manager never stopped by our table to address the issue.  I think that's pretty bad service when you are spending so much money. Their dessert cart is really nice and tons of variety but by the time you get done with the dessert on the tasting menu you are stuffed and can barely eat anymore dessert. As a parting gift they bring out some truffles in a cigar box. You can keep the truffles. It you must return the cigar box. You also get a mini cake. I think it was carrot cake. It's been a while since we are there. Would I go back? Probably not. Food was good but the fish bone issue was swept under the rug and honestly i didn't feel that it was worth the amount of money we spent.",

Yes, it costs $800 Per person..yes, you heard right.. for the the tasting menu, but if you're going to come here, you will might as well go all out.    Make sure you put on a pretty dress and a fancy tie.  Ladies: There is a little bench near your table.  At the time, I wasn't sure what it was for.

The service was great but not as top notch as the service you'll experience at Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace or Mozen at the Mandarin Oriental.    This place is more of a visual experience.  I adored the decor and loved the presentation of the food and dessert!    Went with the 2 appetizers, 1 main course and dessert menu ($190/pp) and it was too much food for me.  For appetizers I really enjoyed the Scallop sashimi with turnip dish and Foie gras with violet artichoke salad topped with parmesan shavings.  For my entree I had the spaghetti with uni and caviar - very rich dish.  Unless you are super hungry, then get this dish.  Otherwise, go for something else. Since my entree was so heavy, for dessert, I went with the light creamy and minty sugar sphere (see pic) .    Would definitely come back but next time I would go for the 1 appetizer, 1 main course + dessert.    If you're running late, valet your car at MGM!  Bon appetit!",

Having already dined at Joel Robuchon twice myself this was not the first time I'd seen such generosity from the kitchen of \"The Chef of the Century\" and much like my previous visits the meal was an exercise in refinement; the room, the food, and the service all well-manicured, highly polished, and lavish.  Taking a 9:00pm reservation and arriving early only to be identified by name as the doors swung open on my approach I was subsequently seated at the same table I'd dined at during my first visit and greeted by a familiar service team including the same dining room manager and server as my prior visit much of what would follow was familiar; the plethoric bread cart and equally impressive cheese course followed by a dessert trolley with nearly three dozen options plus the signature pound cake, though this time smaller than prior.  Deferring on coffee I was additionally treated to a hand clipped tea and infusions cart and a $10 flat charge brought no less than three bottles of Evian - no doubt the cost of admission warrants these things as well as the impressive \"Ruby\" palate cleanser and \"Maize\" amuse - gifts that would constitute proper courses at many restaurants.  Moving on to what was ordered I once again opted to order from the prix fixe as opposed to the larger grand tasting and making a special request for the (menu price $300 if ordered ALC) Pintade Fermiere my only small complaint regarding the entire evening was that Chef Le Tohic felt need to visit my table before the hen's preparation to suggest I'd be better off only ordering half the bird as I'd have gladly (and greedily,) eaten more of the crispy skin and supple flesh sandwiched around thick, buttery, foie gras...though I guess saving the $60 supplement charge was a benefit.  Truffles, foie gras, uni, foie gras, caviar, and more foie gras plus aged comte, spell-binding desserts, and a room and service beyond reproach I can think of much worse ways to celebrate Christmas Eve than with Joel Robuchon's team at the MGM and although I personally would never do so in a T-shirt there is something refreshing about the fact that in a city where there are so many bad high-stakes bets this is a place where anyone willing and able to spend the money is virtually guaranteed an excellent return.",

    "text": "This is one of those restaurants that gets me really excited to write a review. Looking back at my pictures, I'm already looking forward to another visit.   We opted for the six course menu - $240 per person which includes: an amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, two entrees, cheese, dessert, plus the sweet little bites at the end.   We started with the rose champagne and then ordered a couple of bottles of wine. In the end, it was expensive. Like, earn a free flight on your rewards credit card kind of expensive... but... for some people dropping a grand or more on a pair of shoes is their thing. Me? I like to eat.  At first I thought it might be kind of lame but the limo pick up and drop off was beyond a nice touch. When I heard \"gold\" limousine I instantly pictured something bright, gaudy and sequinced. Nope. It's subdued, the driver is profession and it sets you up for a rather lavish event.   When you arrive they seat you in a beautiful salon/parlor to wait for someone to escort you back to the restaurant. Who knew there were (starting at) $5000 a night mansions hidden away at the MGM? You get to walk past them on your way into the restaurant. Hmmm.... must think of a way to become super rich...  They sat us in a small room which resembles a patio. For the longest time we were the only people there. It was comfortable. Dark. Quiet without seeming stuffy. If they brought me out food all night I would have stayed there forever. There was nothing Vegas tacky about the experience. 5 star, high class every step of the way...  I won't rehash every dish but my favorites were the scallop ceviche, the beef ribeye and the pea soup. Actually, come to think of it, everything was amazing and the presentation of each dish was incredible.   The whole evening was beyond special. A night, an experience we'll both remember for a long time to come.   Do I dare say it? Even without the full desgustation menu, I put Joel Robuchon on par with the French Laundry. I used to hit up Chef Robuchon's little sister restaurant l'Atelier every time I came to Vegas but I think we just found a new tradition.  Joel Robuchon is a fantastic restaurant and definitely makes my top five list...",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon get's 4.5 stars for me. This was one of the most amazing restaurants I've been to in my entire life, but there are some things that prevent me from giving this 5 stars. I'll explain in detail.  After arriving, I was checked into a small lounge that is located off the dining room. It's a swanky little place that had a mini bar and some really comfortable lounge chairs. Then, I made my way into the dining room.  The dining room was probably one of the most visually stunning rooms I've ever been to. It was a mix of modern, and elegance. There is also a small outdoor-ish area which has a marvelous vertical garden.  After choosing a menu, that's when the show truly begins. The service here makes you feel like you are John D. Rockefeller. First class all the way. It's elaborate and it makes you feel truly special. This might be the best service I've ever been a part of, so kudos to that.   The highlight of the meal is the bread service, as well as the desserts at the end. This was probably the best bread I've ever been served at any restaurant. It was literally perfection. And the extraordinary bread goes well with the super high end butter that they use. It made the meal start off on a high note.  Where I felt things sort of fell a little bit short in my expectations were the appetizers and entrees. Now keep in mind, they were really good. They use top of the line ingredients, and the technique is impeccable. But for some reason, it just didn't blow away my expectations, even though it was very good. My favorite had to have been the grilled rib eye, it was probably the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. Other than that, everything was good, just not mind blowing, which I was expecting.   As stated earlier, desserts were another high point to the meal. I rarely get desserts at restaurants because generally, I'm disappointed in a certain way. At Robuchon, their dessert game is on point. The lemon dessert I ordered was light, refreshing, and bold without being too overwhelming. Their way of balancing the taste and textures in their desserts is very skillful. They know how to push you to your edge, without making you fall over. And the mignardises at the end are spectacular, I actually wanted to try everything on that cart, and I'm not even a big dessert guy.  I would definitely recommend Joel Robuchon to anyone who wants a very special dinner. Everything is top of the line, and I understand why some consider this restaurant to be among the very best in the world.",

    "text": "At Joel Robuchon, food is made to look as great as it tastes.  Much like the cavemen used animal fats and vegetable juices to paint murals on walls of stone, it is here that food is used as art, plates are used as canvasses, and the restaurant's dishes take on sculptural forms laden with symbolic meaning.  OCD levels of attention are given to every detail. For example, the staff hand-decorates each plate with a water-soluble paint that comes off when the dishes are washed at the end of the evening, only to be re-applied the next day. The dining room is decorated with legitimate fine art, such as Auguste Rodin's \"Age of Airain,\" a bronze statue of a man celebrating his nudity. Before I opened my mouth, the maitre d' greeted me by name.  On my visit to Robuchon, I ordered the Degustation Menu ($445), a marathon tasting of 18 unique dishes, breads, and take-home treats, consisting of the following:  Le Caviar Imperial: Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab in a crustacean gelee dotted with cauliflower puree L'Artichaut Violet: Violet artichoke and foie gras salad with parmesan shavings Le Homard du Maine: Maine lobster in a thinly sliced turnip with sweet and sour dressing L'Asperge Verte: Green asparagus mimosa-style with wasabi cream and caviar L'Oeuf de Poule: Semi-soft boiled egg on a spinach puree with comte cheese sauce L'Asperge Blanche: White asparagus with black garlic, shiso and Esplette pepper La Langoustine: Truffled langoustine raviolo in a foie gras sauce with simmered green cabbage La Crevette Rose: Rose Shrimp in bonito tuna and kombu seaweed broth with ginger L'Oursin: Delicate flan of sea urchin on potato puree topped with Arabica coffee foam La Noix de Saint Jacques: Seared scallop in green curry with young leek Le Foie Gras de Canard: Duck foie gras in crispy gyoza with simmered celery Le Saint-Pierre: John Dory fish fillet with shiso leaf tempura on squid ink risotto Le Pigeon: Roasted squab and foie gras wrapped in green cabbage and bacon L'Hibiscus: Shaved ice with hibiscus syrup Le Matcha: Raspberry-cherry blossom compote Le The Earl Grey: Earl Grey tiramisu with mascarpone Le Papillon Chocolat Azelia: Hazelnut milk chocolate cremeux with coffee chantilly and praline ice cream Miscellaneous Candies and Pound Cake (to take home, \"for tomorrow's breakfast\")  Yelp's character limit prevents me from commenting on all of these dishes individually, though collectively they were excellent.   I was hit between my eyes with the luxurious beauty of the tasting's initial offering: the delicate Le Caviar Imperial is perhaps better known as caviar araignee de mer, or caviar \"spider of the sea,\" and is a work of art sprinkled with flakes of gold. The fresh, buttery caviar was so plentiful in my mouth, it felt like I was chewing a caviar steak coated with the flavorful jellied crustacean consomme it sat in.  The eyeball-like L'Oeuf de Poule was magnificent both to look at and to eat -- pulling off a culinary magic trick that confounded me: a de-shelled egg with a hard-boiled white but with a liquid runny yolk inside. My excellent waiter, Andrew, indicated sous-vide, but I know this can't be accomplished with traditional sous-vide alone -- either the yolks would solidify or the whites would remain soft.  My main course was Robuchon's wickedly-rich squab stuffed with foie gras, with its unlikely but welcomed addition of cabbage and bacon. Le Pigeon was also served with Pommes Robuchon, the world-famous silky, micro-sieved mashed potatoes that maintain an outrageous 2:1 potatoes-to-butter ratio.  Delicious breads were peddled from a bread cart containing close to 20 different options to choose from throughout the meal. I chose a croissant, a milk roll, and an odd (but tasty) bread featuring bacon and mustard seed.  Some of the other tasting stand-outs included the delightful squid ink risotto served with the fish fillet, the rose shrimp served in the umami-rich ocean-y broth, the refreshing shaved ice with hibiscus syrup, and the heavenly chocolate hazelnut dessert with its glamorous edible butterflies made of sugar.  Was it worth the price? That's a personal question that each person needs to decide for themselves. I know people who would burn $500 on slot machines without a second thought, but would consider spending the same amount on a meal in Vegas to be a foolish waste of money. With this restaurant, you're not gambling. Joel Robuchon is Las Vegas's only restaurant to earn Michelin's Three Stars in addition to earning AAA's Five Diamonds, and has now taken residence on my top 5 list of dining experiences. Unlike Adria or Redzepi, Robuchon won't be turning this restaurant into an \"art center\" or \"urban farm\" or other grand experiment any time soon -- it is, after all, consistency and predictability that has won him more Michelin Stars than any chef in the world. If you're going to spend some money on dining in Las Vegas, it should be here.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.9/4.7/4.8",

    "text": "Made an impromptu decision to come here after a series of disappointing 'fine dining' experiences on the strip and was immediately relieved the moment we stepped into Joel Robuchon.  This hidden sanctuary is tucked away at a far corner of MGM that allows you to escape the noise and bustle of Vegas.  It was truly a classy experience from the moment we walked it.  We were seated next to a beautiful indoor garden with plush velvet seats.  There were about 3 servers waiting on our table with impeccable attention to detail.  We ordered the 17 course tasting menu which was amazing from start to finish.  Lots of French classics like caviar and foie gras in creative small plates that came in trios.  There was a slight delay in between some of our courses when they became busy but the manager picked up on it immediately after seeing us look around and our next dish came promptly.  I noticed the two tables seated next to us ordered a la carte and the dishes that came out looked equally impressive.  I know that sometimes restaurants only impress in their tasting menus while the regular menu falls short, but this does not seem to be the case for Joel Robuchon.  I overheard some pretty interesting items being described that I would love to try next time.  They also have a large variety of breads and mini desserts that comes in an extravagant display cart, which I found pretty unique.  The only downside is I wish I could've eaten more of it.  Even the bread was delicious and I'm normally not a big bread eater.  I became way too full by dessert and couldn't properly taste all of it - dessert comes in 3 parts!  One of the desserts was a life like rose decorated with dewdrops of water that I almost did not want to eat because it was a True work of art.  My friend who is not a dessert fan was so impressed by the look and taste of this.  Probably not a bad idea to skip lunch if you want to try to full tasting menu.  Of course this comes with a hefty price tag, but if you're planning on splurging on something nice then this is more worth it than most Vegas establishments.  There are way too many high end restaurants on the strip that razzle and dazzle but fails on the actual food.  I was so glad this was not the case here and we look forward to coming back on our next visit!",

    "text": "I hate to give such a beautiful restaurant 1 star, but the food was absolutely tragic! I have never been to a restaurant where I hated everything I tried, however this was a first.    The decor inside was truly amazing. Beautiful flowers and a pretty chandelier. The service was good and the empty plates did not sit long.   The bread cart, unfortunately, was the best thing about this place when it came to the food. I worried when I saw nothing on the dessert side that would justify an extra $30, so we did not bother. Then when it came to the appetizers, I did not enjoy the fact that you are about to pay a hell of a lot of money for dinner and then all the dishes that looked really good had extra charges, surcharge as they called it, tacked on them. The entrees were the same. If it sounded good there was an extra charge for it. Probably for the truffle, but really? With the amount of cash this place makes you can't throw a customer a bone and give a little truffle?  My girlfriend had the beef carpaccio appetizer. If I could have spit it out at the table I would have. Instead I ate it and then had the horrible taste left in my mouth, and felt like it was swimming in my stomach. The flavor was almost indescribable. Like nothing I have ever tasted. Wood? Earthy? All around made me gag. And my appetizer was the main lobster with daikon. Again the taste was awful. No sauce, nothing really on the plate. Tasted like wood again. Both were REALLY bad.  The main course selections had no great things to choose from, but I figured fish and risotto...can't go wrong right? Well the John Dory fish was over cooked. The tempura leaf on top lacked flavor and was pointless on top of the fish. The fish itself had zero flavor and was dry. Again no sauce. And the squid ink risotto had zero flavor. It was literally rice with some squid ink.  It came with  potatoes, which could not save any part of the meal. My girlfriend had the rib eye which looked like 2 long cubes of beef. I wondered where the rest of the cow went. Reminded me of some strange beef stick.   Being from San Francisco we definitely know good food. However we are not overly picky when it comes to food. It's the principle and the price for what we got. The food was honestly some of the worst food we have ever eaten. My poor girlfriend spent $500 to take me here for an early birthday dinner. What a waste. Save your money people. Go to Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan. The food was soooooo good and much cheaper.",

    "text": "Food 3 stars  Service 5 stars Atmosphere 5 stars Price  1 star  This place has been on my bucket list for years, along with French Laundry. Due to its price tag, we always procrastinated to try it. Since it was a special occasion, we decided to indulge. Reservation was rather easy make. I called only a week prior to our visit, granted it was for a Tuesday night.   As we entered, the space was elegant and intimate, with rich violet cushioned seats, luxurious drapes, and a statement chandelier. We were seated at a table for two next to an open space leading to the door. It was drafty whenever anyone enters or exits. There were cozy booths available and later on I was later informed by Kit, our favorite Server, that Table 17 in their \"Parisian Terrace\" was their best table for two. Service was sublime, an orchestra of soft-spoken professionals aiming for a seamless performance. They even had a level three Sommelier, William. Very impressive indeed.  We decided not to go with the $445 degustation menu as Hubby prefers the traditional 3-5 course meal over 16 courses of smaller bites (my preference). Since it was his Birthday dinner, we went with his choice. We both selected the $250 per person 5 Course Dinner with 2 Appetizers, 2 Entrees, and Dessert. Big mistake! It was TOO much food that we both felt like exploding even before the meal was over. By the time we were done, our meal ended up being the same price as the tasting menu due to all the supplemental charges. If we ever go back, we would be quite happy with the $198 4 Course Dinner.  First came the famous bread cart, with about a dozen different varieties of bread, brioche, and croissant. We omitted the sea salt from our butter.  Though I normally shun bread, we could not help but fill up on their divine bread and sweet butter. After that, everything went downhill until dessert.   We both ordered their Signature appetizer, Truffled Langoustine Ravioli with Foie Gras sauce. Hubby ordered the Oscetra Caviar with Salmon Tartar and I got the Chilled Maine Lobster with thinly sliced turnips. Though they were beautifully presented, none of the appetizers were memorable. Then came our first entrees, his was the Pork made three ways (God knows why he ordered pork), and mine was Black Cod served with Baby Bok Choy. The Cod melted in the mouth, similar in style to Japanese Miso Butterfish. Hubby's pork chops were tiny, it was smaller than rack of lamb but he said it was tasty.   Next came the Duck with Coriander, which both of us had to order with a $60 supplement. Nobody warned us that this was an ENTIRE duck for two people! It was interesting to watch the table-side presentation of our waiter slicing the breast meat for us. Then they took the rest of the duck back to the kitchen to make \"Duck Tacos\". The duck breast was tough, served luke warm, completely under-salted and flavorless. One of the worst Ducks I have had in a French restaurant. Then they brought the Asian-inspired Duck Tacos on a bed of lettuce. The Lettuce was fresh and crisp - sadly, it was the best part of the dish.   Finally we made it to our dessert course. Although I was bursting at the seams, I HAD to order the Chocolate Souffle, and Hubby ordered the lightest dessert available, which was the Lemon Sorbet. We both agreed that our desserts were the HIGHLIGHT of the meal! And I don't even have a sweet tooth. Their heavenly Chocolate Souffle alone was worth coming back for.  By the time they rolled out the dessert cart for after-dinner treats, we were full to the rim. They also surprised us with a lovely Ice-Cream Cake for the Birthday Boy! We each had a slice of the refreshing Passionfruit and Coconut Ice-cream cake.    This place is a classic case of a 3 Michelin Star resting on its laurels. They earned their stars more than a decade ago and Michelin has not been back to Vegas since 2010 to reevaluate. To be honest, we prefer the Classical French cooking at Picasso for less than half the price of the Asian-Fusion style at Robuchon. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items or we should have gone with the Tasting Menu, but at over $1K with wine and tip, it had better be mind-blowing!",

    "text": "I've been to many 3 Michelin Star Restaurants, and Joel Robuchon remains a clear winner for the following reasons:  1. The Food. The most important factor, Robuchon's food is always exquisite and top notch. Each one is a work of art, but also a work of flavors. No gimmicky dishes that are all flash and no substance. Everything has purpose.    2. The Menu. The vast majority of other 3-star restaurants only allow for tasting menus. This is to make it easier on the kitchen, but it forces everyone into the same menu, which may not be to everyone's liking. And while the menu does change seasonally, sometimes you just aren't feeling like eating 14 courses over a 3 hour dinner. Robuchon not only has its tasting menu (which should be everyone's choice on their first visit), but it has much more smaller and affordable set menus, where you can customize what you want.    3. The price. Okay, this place is not cheap by any means, but it's inline with all the other 3 star restaurants. However, they give ALOT more food for that same price. What is a 14 course meal here may only be a 10 course meal in another 3-star restaurant, and that's not including the vast bread and candy selections offered by Robuchon. Not to mention, if you really want to cut down the price, get a fixed set course menu, and you still have access to the bread and candy!  Overall one of my favorite restaurants worldwide, and a very strong recommendation.",

    "text": "No words would ever be able to accurately describe the wonderful experience I had at Joel Robuchon last night... simply AMAZING. My boyfie, whom I owe everything to now, SURPRISED me with dinner here for being a kickass girlfriend. Am I lucky or nah?   Beyond lucky. :))))  We both ordered the full tasting menu along with the wine pairing. There are 3 tiers for the wine pairing @ $295, $595, and the premium. The sommelier goes over the difference in each price point without being pushy at all. Everything we ate/drank was just absolutely amazing. I can honestly say it's the best meal I've ever had in my life along with the best wine I've ever had in my life. This place was also accommodating to my pescatarian needs, which wasn't that many substitutions since their menu is majority seafood.  Favorites of the night: x Quinoa and red pepper amuse bouche x Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab and a crustacean Gelee x Langoustine ravioli x Lobster wrapped in spinach x Some kind of corn soup/puree (my favorite of the night) x ALL THE BREAD from their bread cart with their ridiculously good butter. I usually hate filling up on bread anywhere, but the bread here is on another level...  Everything was just so over the top, but to perfection. Full tasting menu is the way to go. I highly recommend the wine pairing as well.  Service was great and they were are so very friendly. The only thing I was EH about the entire night was when the boyfie spilled some of my wine and they didn't think/offer to refill it... a fluke perhaps? Regardless, I won't hold that minor hiccup against them. The food was everything. How will I ever be the same again. I can't stop thinking about my meal here :(",

The level of service and attention to detail are dream like and it all comes across as genuine and so very authentic by every member of this incredible staff.

    "text": "Summary for what you are about to read below:   Appetizers: 1-2 stars Entrees: 1-2 stars Desserts: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Price: 1 star Overall: 3 stars  Here are the reasons why I only gave this restaurant three stars: We ordered the tasting menu which is $445 per person. There are roughly 17 different plates before you end up with an after dessert cart that you can choose pastries from. Without getting too detailed, we ordered the current tasting menu for April of 2017. It had a lot of seafood on it and some foie gras. All of the dishes, across the board, from the appetizer to the entree, were underwhelming and just OK. I would never order any of these dishes again. Quite frankly, I believe I can get way better seafood at average seafood restaurants that cost a lot less money than this restaurant. One of the plates was a poached egg with some spinach puree around it... What? It was bland and terrible. For $445, I simply got a poached egg?!  Had it not been for the bread basket at the beginning and the dessert and after dessert cart, everything from the appetizer to the entree would have gotten one star from me. I am not joking as I disliked the meal that much and could not believe I was taking bites of it. I was trying to justify the fact that I would be paying for this meal after ordering it. I know phenomenal restaurants. I am blessed enough to be well-traveled and love amazing food. I have the means to also go to top places. This place may be rated as a three Michelin star restaurant, but it is nowhere near any Michelin star by my standards until I got to dessert, which simply put is the star of the show. Maybe, if I ordered off the menu rather than the tasting menu, I would have liked it more. There is a high-end restaurant that looks like a circus tent covering it at the Bellagio that is cheaper than this restaurant and way better from the appetizer all the way to dessert and has incredible wine pairings that this restaurant simply did not open up about in terms of how much it would cost to do that. The total meal, for tasting menu for two people, a Pinot Noir bottle at $175, with tax and tip of 20%, came out to $1400. Yes, very expensive and not worth it!  If this restaurant allowed simply for ordering dessert, we would be back in a heartbeat. I don't think I would want to eat another meal here as I was that underwhelmed. There are too many other amazing places in Las Vegas to go to and this one really disappointed me. The restaurant is gorgeous, the service is very nice, and you even get a pound cake, lemon flavored, to go home with as a gift in the end which is very nice. It is lovely for special occasions if you're looking for a phenomenal ambiance. I would order off the menu itself and I would not do the tasting menu as this was the first time I was very disappointed with a tasting menu. Dessert gets 5 stars, as does the bread basket at the beginning, so it averages out to three stars.",

    "text": "This is the most expensive meal I've ever eaten but it was amazing.  First off the interior is amazing. The decor and waitstaff uniforms is a very interesting but well pulled off. It is a elegant combination of upscale early 1900s European feel with an east Asian touch.  I couldn't come here and not get their full tasting menu. At this point I can't remember exactly how many courses there were but easily more than you can count on your fingers. It will set you back around $500 per person with or without wine pairings but if you can afford it, it is definitely an experience. There are a few smaller tasting menus if you are not as hungry or looking to eat a little cheaper.  The food is just amazing to taste and look at. One of the desserts could only be described as a mini art sculpture (See the picture I posted. Everything in the picture minus the glass bowl was edible and amazing). The courses had everything from things simple as a beat mustard salad to a seafood mousse topped with caviar. All of it fantastic.   Others have written about it but the bread cart itself is a site to behold. I was tempted to ask what it would cost me to come back and just be able to sit, drink wine, and eat off the bread cart. I also love that the bread cart is continued to be brought to you at request throughout the meal.   One of the more impressive experiences was the service. Not just from the wait staff but from everything. The instance that stands out the most was during the meal with one of the courses. I really enjoyed it. My wife was not a fan of this particular course. I cleared my plate and she had a few bites and set it aside. The waiter asked her if there was anything wrong, and she simply replied it wasn't to her taste. With that the waiter politely cleared our plates in preparation for the next course. In less than 10 minutes before the next actual course came out the waiter brought my wife a new dish, and explained it was something special from the chef as an apology that she had not enjoyed the last course. It was fantastic and I  was impressed that they took it upon them self to do this without any asking or prompting.   Save some of your gambling money and come here. It is worth it.",

I chose the one appetizer and one main with dessert and it was plenty of food for me.   For the appetizer, the caviar with salmon sparked my interest since i've never tried it before. I felt i'd either hate it or love it. And i loved it! Very rich, and the mixture of flavors were very pleasant to the palette.    My main was equally as delicious. I chose the beef bouffe i think thats what it was called (Basically the ribeye) and it was very tender and flavorful along with everything else on the plate.   Dessert... There was so much dessert! We ordered dessert and also got some from the tray and also got served cake since it was my bday! Everything was delicious. Try the black forest, choco souffle, praline chocolate, passion fruit macaron, eclairs, coffee, strawberry tart... They're all delicious!  The ambiance of the restaurant is very quiet and intimate which was a stark contrast to any restaurant i've been to ever. Feels very classy and proper... I felt not as relaxed as i am at a place like nobu but it was a different kind of dining experience i enjoyed.   Service was fabulous along with the food and i would recommend it to anyone!",

I chose the tasting menu which ended up being $575 after tip and tax (think of all the street tacos you could buy with that). The best dish was the Caviar Imperial which was the first dish and then it was all pretty \"meh\" from there. There wasn't a single taste or combination that was innovative/I hadn't tasted before and the courses weren't that good themselves. Everything felt like it could have been made....better. The service was good, whatever. Bread and dessert cart were cool but not that cool. The highlight of my dinner was having these 5 tacky purple bejeweled rhinestones in the middle of my table that I couldn't stop fiddling with. They also give you a WHOLE pound cake at the end to make you feel better about how much money you just spent but not sure if it was good or not as I didn't eat it.",

    "text": "I've been in love with Chef Robuchon (more like his food) since 2009, when I set my foot for the very first time in L'Aterlier next door. Since then I've made it a mission to visit his other international locations when I travel. Yes, maybe I'm biased here...  Anyway, we came here awhile back, before people even realized there was a Joel Robuchon here, right next to Ka.   There were only 4 tables occupied at the whole dining room that evening, including a food critic, and possibly a smaller group for a semi-private event. It was very quiet, and could be intimidating for some. But I love that atmosphere, as I often find majority of upscale restaurants in the U.S. to be quite loud and once in awhile, I just want to have that one nice meal quietly without hearing what's going on at nearby tables.   Service was great, and we had the full attention from the staff. They made sure everything was done right and we were taken care of for even the smallest request. Very attention to detail.   Food wise, I'm always a fan. Everything was done to perfection. But what I LOVE the most was the bread cart and dessert cart, and that becomes the reason why I'd skip L'Aterlier to come here or similar restaurants such as Le Chateau in Tokyo, because I want to be able to choose my desserts. And goodie bags at the end of the evening is always a plus too... (yum)  I did hear from another friend who just visited here a few months ago that the place is quite popular now and maybe the crowds make some difference to the experience. I guess I'll have to go back again to find out myself.",

    "text": "With the recent passing of Chef Robuchon, I wanted to share my memory of my dinner back in April. I'm not sure what else could be said of this restaurant that hasn't already been said. Every single minute detail has been thought out regarding the presentation of food and the environment that you experience it in.  Over the course of 19 individual dishes, the tasting menu took me on a journey that I have thought about very regularly since I have gone several months ago. Before I mention the perfectly prepared food however, I would like to offer my praise for our serving captain Nathan -- along with his supporting staff -- who provided a level of service that far exceeds any experience I've had in the past. Given the special occasion and our younger age, I appreciated Nathan bringing a slightly less formal and more amicable personality to the table, but through the excellence of his service, I have a hard time imagining him not giving a table perfect, formal service at the highest level if he had a sense that was what they wanted. All the textbook formalities were performed perfectly: greeting and serving the lady first, crumbing the table only when one is excused for the restroom, bringing out each glass of wine at the perfect time, an astute knowledge of everything on the menu. The service was perfect, but in addition to that he created took a very formal environment and elevated it to a level of entertainment that I have not experienced anywhere else.  Every piece of minutiae regarding the food was presented in the exact same way as the service. The foods served took what was mostly simple ingredients and brought them to such a high level they tasted unlike what you've had before. Bread fresh out of the oven is brought to the table in dozens of varieties. Basil and saffron rolls, bacon twists, and mini baguettes. Tomatoes, Lemon and oil our brought together in a way that exemplifies each ingredient, a generous serving of Osetra carving throughout the lighter dishes, as well as a generous portion of numerous varieties of seafood. Following these dishes is a perfectly cooked American Wagyu ribeye served with two wonderful sauces, crisp tempura battered shallots and the pinnacle of refinement: Robuchon's Pomme Puree.   Following the entrees and main course are four perfectly prepared, visually stunning dishes in the forms of various sorbets, cakes, mousses and other patisserie magic. Following the larger dishes was a collection of mignardise, ranging from lollipops, macarons and meringues, as well as an excellent assortment to take with us due to a server hearing mentioning that we were almost full. He noted to serve us the harder to transport pastries and then package an assortment of more durable ones to go -- a small, but appreciated detail.  Overall, there are very few places that can charge well over $1,000 for two guests and a few drinks, but if there is one restaurant that can justifiably do so, it is this one. You can go in, expect a perfect meal, and get a perfect meal. So far, it has been the best meal and dining experience of my life.",

    "text": "The price is steep, but the quality is the best you can possibly hope for in Las Vegas.  Stepping into the restaurant is so unique.  On either side of the opening you have a Cirque show and slot machines, then you walk into a prestige, clean area with all waiters wearing suits.  Not the biggest area with only a few dozen tables, but very cozy and well groomed atmosphere with chandeliers and real flowers on the walls.  The food was high quality French.  Each dish of the degustation seemed very seasonal and had a chef's tough with either the design or cooking technique to give it the taste or texture desired.  The best part of any high dining experience is that the chef will recommend an order or a way to eat the dish.  This means the chef expects a reaction not the dish and in my opinion makes it better than just an entree and dig in, while mixing ingredients not intended for each other.  But there are too many dishes to discuss from the degustation as it's about a 17 plate tasting with extra desserts and bread.    The bad parts to begin the review.  Firstly, the chef's insistence on asparagus.  They were in about 5 dishes either in soup or grilled form.  Never added any taste and the flavor overwhelmed.  The pace was extremely slow as well.  With a tasting such as this, I expected a new dish to come out every 10 minutes or so.  Instead, Robuchon would bring out 3 dishes at a time, and then expect you to wait 30 minutes for the next - poor structure.  Bread service should have been nonstop as well, only when we asked for more were we brought.  Finally, the vegetarian tasting was absurdly basic.  About 7-8 of our dishes between regular and inveterate were identical.  The other vegetarian dishes were just more of the same vegetables with only a couple memorable items such as tempura tofu and ravioli.  Otherwise, you were just eating side vegetable dishes all night with no high end additions such as caviar or foie gras.  And not to mention, this is the same price as the regular.  The price obviously is high and expected so I wouldn't put it as a negative but just a choice - buyer beware.  The good were all meats.  From the entree steak to two separate lobster courses, to a strong scallop - all were delicious.  Foie gras and caviar gave it the high end feel, as did the smoked salmon.  The bread was very good, especially with the amount of selection and the fact that they heat it up for you upon ordering.  The dessert was out of this world in terms of flavor and beauty and selection, with the tasting menu's signature dessert more or less a jungle of different flavors.  Also, being a birthday or anniversary type of venue, they are always prepared to have something special for you if you let them know ahead of time  The wine list can get high, but honestly wasn't absurd with many options in the price range of a regular steakhouse on the strip.  $50 corkage fee is a great deal as well considering the price point of the meal.  And a goody bag to go with a nice pistachio and fruit cake is always a fantastic touch.  The experience was great and I would never take that back.  And looking at the regular menu, you can easily come for a $200 tasting and get a great fancy meal.  Robuchon is high class in Vegas and a once a year type of dining.  Food was great and hit every tastebud I was hoping for.  Very glad I had the opportunity to dine here.",

    "text": "Got to go back to our favorite restaurant around this past weekend and it did not disappoint.  We have been here 6 or 7 times and leave wowed each time.  We have only done the degustation menu once, the first time we went.  It was just too much food and since then have seemed to settle in on the 4 course option (2 apps, 1 entree, 1 dessert).  This meal they started with two amuse bouches which was a pleasant surprise since in the past I can only remember one.  The first one I missed what it was.  It was breaded and extremely rich bite.  The second amuse was a chilled corn soup with creme fraiche and caviar.  The last few times we have had a similar amuse, with it being a gazpacho since we have usually been there during the summer.  They have a bread cart with 30 different options to choose between.  The chooses have been the same over each of our visits which isn't a problem since they are all good and there are so many.  Keep in mind that they only warm the first set of bread you get, after that it will be straight from the cart.  I usually stick to the warm appetizers but this time I started with chicken egg filled with king crab and caviar.  Wife went with the pumpkin veloutte with alba white truffles.  Both were spectacular.  From there we both had the truffled langostines.  This is 3 langostine raviolis filled and topped with truffle in a foie gras butter emulsion.  This is my single favorite dish I have had at any restaurant.  There hasn't been a time we have gone to Robuchon's and not ordered this.  We matched again on dishes with the entree, both selecting the spit roasted duck.  We may have just not been paying attention but we couldn't remember ever seeing duck as an option before on our previous visits.  This was a good rendition.  We have had some absolute standout versions at other places like EMP that would put above this one.  We ended with dessert this time.  Wife went for the chocolate souffle.  I did a tayberry coulis.  Wife thought this was the best souffle she has had.  I very much liked my dessert too, as it was light and beautifully plated.    Hint, you can substitute the cheese trolley for the dessert which is what we normally do since you will get plenty of sweets with the dessert cart.  Speaking of dessert cart, this is something that is a True standout.  The mignardises are fantastic.  They have 40+ different options.  Can't say enough about this place.  It is a special dinner place where you are going to spend $$$$$$$$$$$$$.  Go into this expecting to leave a little poorer but you should leave really satisfied on the quality of food.",

It was such a surprise when we got there and was informed that they had set us up in a private room and still allowed us to pick out different sets.  The private room was amazing! It was very extravagant - front the table setting to the chandelier.   Our waiter, Yann, was both very professional and hilarious! He explained all of our meals well and answered all of our questions. He made our dinner such a great experience.  The food was great and the plating, especially the dessert, was very well done. And like others have previously said the bread and dessert carts are to die for!   Definitely worth the money!",

And to be frank with you, I'm willing to pay the extra bens if the dining experience is actually worth it. But here? Nah. What I didn't like about this place is there wasn't any speciality dishes. For the price I paid, I wasn't expecting to be a served a hard boiled egg, deep fried poached egg or raw salmon as my appetizers. Come on Joel, whip me up something that I can't eat anywhere else. Give me a reason to come back. I was here for your signature dishes but you definitely failed me.   The main entrees here were a bit underwhelming. The rib eye was good but unfortunately I had better steak elsewhere. Prime Steakhouse or the A5 Japanese Wagyu at Picasso in the Bellagio is much more deserving of a 5 star rating in my books.  1 star for the beautiful food presentation.  1 star for the service.",

Every dish is well thought out in terms of presentation of the food, plate ware, colors, and then elevated with some sort of foam, gelee, flavor layering, and/or intricate presentation. You almost feel bad for eating such a lovely piece of artwork... almost ;) Some of my favorites have been:  -Caviar Crab Salad/Parfait -Joel Robuchon Mashed Potatoes -Salad of Tomato/Gelee  Bread Cart - so many to choose from!  10+ daily baked breads are rolled out to you for selection. After you pick out your heart's desire, it is heated and brought back to you. I love the breads, but I love the butter more! Imported French butter curled tableside and sprinkled with sea salt. Such a Beautiful presentation!   Candy Cart - again, so many to choose from!  I lost count of how many they offer! But I always muster up my appetite to try at least 6 varietals, ranging from the caramels, candies, bon bons, pastries, chocolates, and more.   Tea Cart - so fresh (literally), and so cool!  Fresh herb plants are rolled to your table for you to choose. Upon your selection, the server snipes the plants, cleans the leaves, and brews the tea. It's the only place I've ever seen this type of tea service.   Definitely a once in a lifetime experience to have, if not more! Bon appetit!",

Now this isn't a place you just go to on a whim, you need to make reservation in advance and to be honest you really need to save up especially if your planning on ordering the tasting menu because its going to set you back $500 a person and the whole table must order it.   With that being said, the meal is truly a dining experience.  Every detail is planned out from the first to last course and your going to be impressed with all the different flavors and artistry that goes into the preparation of the food.  The bread and dessert carts are amazing and you will probably want to try everything even if you stomach says no but your brain says yes.",

You walk in, with your reservation, dressed correctly, and you are greeted by a wonderful person who takes you to the start of a food journey you will always remember and dream about later. The place is beautiful. It is comfortable with soft chairs and lovely decorations. It is spotless and you can tell that someone really loves to care for this place. It looks new, although it is not. Once seated you are given menus and you can order from the tasting menu, which is wonderful, or the main menu. There is no going wrong here. Each item is perfect. They bring you bread and oils and butters and you think, this is pretty, after all it is just bread--no it is not, it is pieces of heaven and you can put a tab of butter or try one of the oils and you will know that bread can be all one needs in the world.  They have a full bar and extensive wine list. If you want it, they have it. The food is perfect. It is so lovely you don't want to touch it but you know it is going to be like nothing you have had before. Each bite is something to take slowly and enjoy all the flavor and different tastes all in one bite. The service is perfect, when you want them they are there and they seem to know when to just leave you be in your own little world of food of the Gods.  Order whatever you want. You can't go wrong and save room for desert.  Now, all of this is going to cost you so so much money. It is a very expensive place to dine. There is nothing to order on a budget. But it is worth it, even if just once in your life, it is worth it. I usually say in my reviews to take you kids, but not this time. You can, they are welcome, but I don't know if a 10 year old will understand that he is eating the food of the Gods.  Have the best time.",

(I did exactly that... but I starved for a few months... & I don't gamble... LOL).   From the moment we stepped in.. we were greeted by pleasantly the hostess and then the manager, walked us to our table.  The decor is a mix of glamour, heavy drapery, beautiful high ceiling and the table setting is fit for an upscale wedding.   I love how we were facing the outdoor garden and can see fresh greenery, a contrast to the dark drapery.  The lighting is perfect, not too bright but dim enough for awesome gram pics! The bathroom is hidden behind an enclosed pathway, it is a very beautified space for us ladies.    We chose the 12 course tasting menu... best decision ever because by course # 6... I was beyond full and almost about to bust out of my dress (unfortunate poor choice of wear... Vegas = Body hugging gear... ugh).  Each course is executed beautifully with creative plating and the sequence makes each bite mouth watering deliciousness.  Keep in mind, although it's 12 course, they throw in a few special \"compliments from the chef\", making your meal to be about 16 courses!    My favorite was the rib steak in cubes w/organic veggies, the artsy dessert in a spiral dome, the tasty lobster served like a wonton w/ pickled radish and both the \"bread\" & \"dessert last bite\" table! Delicious display of all kinds of bread on display with the smooth slow churned butter (my ultimate weakness!). The dessert table is beyond anyone's imagination & will give your \"sweet tooth\" a headache! Macarons!! Tarts!! Berries of all kind!! Cue: 50 Cents \"I love you like a fat kid loves cake\" on repeat while I tried to contain my excitement!   Definitely a YOLO moment for me!  Total bill... a little close to $1k... well, it's the Michelin Star way!  Would do it again! ;)   PS: they also give you a parting gift! Fresh made bread or cake more like! It was soft & yummy!   Happy \"major splurging\", YOLO Yelpers!",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is one of the best restaurants I have have been to. With drinks, dinner for two will cost you over $1000--but that price tag comes with three Michelin stars from one of the world's most celebrated chef. It is also one of the most expensive restaurants in North America.   The restaurant is small. It has an exclusive feel. The decor gives off an air of opulence - very fitting for a meal that will cost you over $1000.  A meal at Joel Robuchon is not simple meal. It is a 3+ production - a pageantry of culinary artistry. I should note that the production started well before we arrived at the restaurant. A limo was sent to our hotel to transport us to the MGM. We were then taken behind the MGM and guided to the restaurant.   The service was excellent. The servers were professional, attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed my interaction with all of the servers. They really enhanced my enjoyment of the evening.   We had the 18 course tasting menu. What can I say? The tasting menu was absolutely exquisite. It delighted all of the senses. Every course was a treat to the sense. I will highlight a few of my favourites:   (1) The La Langoustine with a truffled langostine ravioli with simmered green cabbage; La Noix de Saint-Jacques with a seared diver sea scallop served with kumquat and caviar; and La Soupe Folichonne with a medley of aromatic herbs in an exotic broth.  (2) L'Oursin, a sea urchin atop a puree of fennel and potato with citrus jus; Le Black Cod with caramelized black cod in a Malabar black pepper sauce with pak choy; and La Langouste, a spiny lobster grilled with a green curry jus and fresh coriander.   (4) The Le Caviar Imperial, a signature dish of Chef Robuchon's, which contain gold flakes.   (3) The Chateaubriand beef topped with foie gras and rolled in black truffles with a Porto sauce was delicious. Robuchon's famous puree de pomme de terre (Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes) comes with the dish. I must admit that I was quite full by this time.   Make sure you leave room for dessert. The dessert is just as good as all of the courses that came before and is a wonderful way to finish an epic dinner.",

    "text": "Located deep inside the MGM hotel, we walked, and walked, and walked until we finally found the restaurant. The hostess welcomed our party of four immediately and graciously offered to take some photos of the group before showing us to our table.   Touches of gold and crystal accessories give the posh dining room an air of surrealism, even for Las Vegas. Gem blues and purples set against a canvas of black and white set the stage for the grand performance. It took me several minutes to take it all in, and that's OK; I was having a moment as I looked around, while seated on a beautifully tufted purple settee.  It's a good thing I marveled at the decor for a bit; no one came to the table for a while which I thought was odd for this type of dinner. Finally, we requested to speak to the sommelier to get suggestions on French wine for our budget. When the somm came by, he replied that he had \"just the right one and would bring it over.\" I found it odd he didn't offer various options, but decided to trust him and let it go. After a good ten minutes or so passed, we inquired as to his whereabouts with a gentleman who stood nearby. Sure enough, the somm finally reappeared carrying a bottle of wine which we tasted and approved. Minutes later, the gentleman that helped us with the somm came by to icily take our order. By now, I must admit I felt annoyed. High-end restaurants with dismissive attitudes are not OK in my book. Proper? Yes. Pompous. No! I don't care how highly awarded you are. It's not OK.   Thankfully, the rest of the staff and the waitress who then took over for the remainder of the night saved the day! She interacted perfectly by delivering a professional, yet casual experience.  She spoke with us at length explaining every dish, answering any questions we had, and sharing stories. Given we spent a good three hours or so there, this mattered greatly.    The food. Oh, the food. I, for one, loved it all and would return in a magical minute. Not everyone did, but I suppose they can get their own Yelp account and explain their side.   It's no secret this is an expensive restaurant. After all, Joel Robuchon is the most Michelin-starred chef IN THE WORLD. Naturally, before the Michelin Guide left Las Vegas, it had the very coveted three stars. As per my experience, it falls somewhere pricier than Eleven Madison (with a corkage fee) but less than Alinea/French Laundry (with wine pairings). The menu offers four options base priced at $127, $169, $198, or $250 pp. Basically, you combine a different number of appetizers, main courses, dessert, and mignardises. There are some supplementary charges as well. TIP: The $169 menu seemed to be the best option. No dessert needed. I thought it was odd they added the (usually complimentary) mignardises as an option, until I realized why. More on that in a bit. While the menu offered the expected classic French fare, the picturesque and tweezer-happy plating steered closer to French techniques of today.   WHAT I TRIED: Caviar & Salmon Tartar|Lobster & Guacamole|Truffled Langoustine Ravioli|Black Cod|Beef Ribeye|Plume of Iberico Pork|Souffle|Mignardises  HIGHLIGHT: The langoustine ravioli with its foie gras sauce, I wish I had a ten of those. We all agreed, this was a winner!  Every menu included an amuse bouche. Once we placed our orders, bread service began. Not just ANY bread service. A cart with at least a dozen in-house freshly baked bread of all types rolled up. TIP: While it's easy to over-order (is there such thing as too much bread?) start slowly, the bread comes around often throughout the night. Once you choose, the butter cart appears. Of course, it does. French butter sliced individually and olive oil poured tableside, such a treat.    The only dessert that appealed to me off the menu was the souffle. And while it actually delighted me- after all, it was perfect- I wish I would have saved the space for the grand finale: the mignardise cart. A stunning Wonka-esque display of sweets sat tableside, begging to be explored. I can't believe I'm admitting this, but I barely tried any. Darn souffle! It's probably my biggest regret of the night. Sigh. Because I happened to be celebrating my birthday, they also brought out a lovely and delicate complimentary meringue cake: adorned in spectacular pastel-colored rosettes and bearing a single candle. Happy birthday to me indeed! As a parting gift, every couple received a cellophane wrapped citrus butter loaf to take home, as a token of gratitude for visiting.   Despite the rocky start, dinner lived up to my (very high) expectations, and I dream of returning. If you are serious about fine dining and new experiences, add this one to your bucket list.   For my South Florida friends, know L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (the more casual concept) should be opening Winter 2017 (reportedly, alongside Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC Kitchen and Bradley Kilgore's new restaurant). Gasp! Winter really IS coming!",

    "text": "Fantastic! Here is my over due review of Joel Robuchon...  The meals and experiences here are always wonderful. The menu always changes with seasonal ingredients.    We started off with l'ceuf de poule - Hen's egg with caviar The next dish was Le Caviar Imperial  which was delicious! consisted of Scottish salmon confit coated with osetra caviar and a wasabi cream. I was pure treat paired with Vega-Sicilia Unico 1989. Silky with great power... Personally, the wine improves significantly over time. I suggest decanting and let it mix with oxygen.   The white asparagus with black garlic paste was delicious. The black garlic was very potent - the way I like my garlic... The black cod dish was one of my favorite and of course the Wagyu beef...  It was good way to end dinner with treats! on to the dessert cart. What a great evening.",

    "text": "Top 3 meals of my life!  Most celebrity chef's restaurants  in Vegas, I have found to be disappointing and they seem to have more sizzle than steak. Joel Robuchon is the exception! The attention to detail, the service, the food, the presentation...everything was just PERFECT.   Bernard Claeys, the General Manager gave me a little tour and told me about Joel Robuchon, the history of the restaurant and their system. He was great and if you watch him operate and see how he adjusts the silverware and greets the guest etc, you will know that he is a big reason why this restaurant is where it is.   The service was great. My party was dressed very casually compared to the other guests and the waiters and other staff still made us feel very comfortable. Paul who was our head waiter was awesome.   The food was incredible. Every dish was like a piece of art and the flavors were just bursting in my mouth.  And the bread, OMG! How do they make bread like this? With the hand churned butter and olive oil...delish. The chocolates for dessert and the pound cake were amazing. I am not a Vegas fan but I am going back just to dine here again!",

I have been to s few 3 stars and tons of 2 and 1 star restaurants.  I should of wrote this review years ago and I'm kicking myself because if I were to review every restaurant I have been to even just the upscale ones I would have hundreds if not thousands of reviews.  I eat out about 300 days a year.  Enough about me and let's get to the nuts and bolts of this review.  The ambiance and atmosphere is amazing, the dinning room is absolutely beautiful and very quiet.  I suggest wearing something purple to pop with the interior for your Instagram!  I always do the full 15 course menu to get a taste of everything and to enjoy the experience.  I will admit I had to skip a few courses the first time...  Now I am a seasoned vet and I can do the all the courses which I think they have taken a couple out over the years.  The bread cart may be the most impressive - a work of art and you want to eat so much... Hint - do not over load on bread!!!  You have 13-15 courses plus cheese cart and extra dessert cart after dessert courses!!! The sommelier is 2nd to none... He literally would talk a book about each wine.  He makes you want to drink wine and have him talk to you as you indulge and experience the essence in which it was created.  The courses are out of this world blending flavors and ingredients one could only be frightened by the complexity only to experience bliss with every bite!!!  The trios compress the time - give yourself 3 hours to dine here - at least 2 if in a hurry!!! Joel is a True master and there is no doubt to why he is the best of the best he best of the best.",

    "text": "Dined here a couple of months ago, let me begin with the arrival.  Thanks to many helpful Yelpers I called in advanced and reserved the gold limo pickup service.  Promptly at 7:30 they were in front of our hotel ready to pick my husband and I up.  When we arrived we entered through a back entrance where a beautifully dressed woman was waiting for us.  She then  escorted us all the way into the actual restaurant and our table. Wow, now that's an entrance.   The restaurant is not very large yet does not feel crowded in any way, instead it has a very intimate feeling.  There are beautiful chandeliers and rich fabrics everywhere.  Beautiful.We opted for the largest tasting menu.  Now we have had our share of tasting menus so we would like to think that for the most part we know pretty well what to expect, from the \"flow\" of the menu to the portions. Every dish here was so over the top, (in the best way  possible) oozing flavors.  One of my favorites was the \"Caviar Surprise\"  Ossetra  (also Oscietra, Osetra, Asetra) caviar served atop of king crab and a crustacean  gelee, yes I know!!!! Every dish was like this, rich and decadent.  By the time we reached the last course, the beef chop, we were stuffed.  This huge chop comes out of the kitchen and both my husband and I looked at each other , as in \"that can't ALL be for us\", and yes, yes it was.  Rich and buttery but we could only finish about a third of it.  Dessert was also delicious and at this point we were both tasting menu \"wasted\".  Were escorted back through the back of the hotel with cake to go, yes more food.  The gold limo dropped us off at our hotel where we proceeded to begin our food coma for the night.  Service, food, experience, all top notch.  M.P.",

    "text": "Can't believe that I've written 399 reviews already. To celebrate the 400th review, I saved it for one of the best meals/experience I ever had. Its no wonder the man is named Chef of the Century. His namesake restaurant incorporates attention to food and service like no other restaurant I've been to.   After reading reviews from fellow yelpers, I knew I had to call a week ahead to ask for a limo reservation.  On the night of our reservation, a gold limo came to pick us up at the Mandalay Bay. It drove us to the MGM and dropped us off right in front of the secret entrance to the MGM residences in the back of the hotel. We got a quick glimpse of the place as we walked through it. The garden courtyard, looked like an outdoor garden, was actually indoors. Our hostess told us a night in one of these rooms start at $10K. I guess I'll just stick with the free walkthrough of the place instead.   The walkthrough eventually leads us back to the general public casino of the MGM, right next to Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Our hostess took our coats and brought stools for all the ladies' purses. Our servers quickly brought us menus and took our drink orders. Once all our orders were taken, the magic began!   First up was the butter and olive oil cart. Prepared tableside, the server scrapes two layers of butter and sprinkles fleur de sel on it carefully. He explained that the butter was from Britain. Next he pours olive oil from spain into small bowls.   Next up was the bread cart! I think I ate about 6 or 7 different kinds of bread. I already told myself not to eat too much in order to save room for the rest of the meal, but the bread was just so irresistible! My faves were the Milk bread, Basil bread, Bacon bread, Croissant and the Cheese brioche (in no particular order). The first time they bring the bread cart around to take everyone's order, they'll actually bring the bread back to the kitchen to warm it up. Afterwards, they just bring an assorted tray around to see if anyone wants more bread. The ones on the tray don't get warmed up! They came by 4 times to offer us more bread throughout the meal.   Our amuse bouche for the night was beets soup with marscapone cheese. I don't like beets, but even I found this to be quite delicious! The presentation and choice of serving ware was spot on.   For the appetizer, I had the Lobster with truffle. It came with three huge pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, topped with three big pieces of winter truffles. The sauce complimented the lobster perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the truffles.   The next appetizer I had was the Crispy soft boiled egg with truffles. The egg was perfect, with yolk slowly oozing out as you cut into it!   For my entree, I had the chicken with foie gras. This dish required an extra supplement, which I think is totally worth it since California no longer has foie gras available. The chicken and foie gras come served in a big pot, and is presented to you tableside as the server carefully plates the contents onto a plate for you. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the foie gras was so rich. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit salty for my taste.   For dessert, I had the Herb sorbet with sabayon. This was the perfect palate cleanser. So refreshing yet the perfect sweet ending to the meal. One of my friends ordered the sugar sphere with orange mousse. This was an amazing presentation. The clear and shiny sphere of sugar was filled with orange mousse. It was really too beautiful to crack open to eat!   And of course the best part of the meal, the dessert cart, comes to finish off our experience here. The cart has over 40 things. By the time the server went through everything on the cart, I already forgot what were the items he mentioned in the beginning. But he was so patient with us and answered our questions as we pointed and asked him what certain items were again and again. The cart has small candies and chocolates, to french macarons, to lollipops and marshmallows, to even small desserts (creme brulee, panna cotta). I felt like a little kid in a candy store! My favorite items were the yuzu truffle, the blueberry cheesecake bite, and the pineapple pop.   Before our meal came to an end, the server brought all the ladies at the table a gift bag. It came with a loaf of cake and a glossy picture book of the dishes at the restaurant (some of them were the ones we ate).   When we were about ready to go, we let the hostess know for her to get the limo ready. Once the limo arrived, she walked us back through the MGM residences to our limo which took us back to the Mandalay Bay.   Overall, this place is worth every single penny. The experience as a whole was flawless. Service was spot on, food was beyond expectations, and presentation of everything was a masterpiece. Every dish looked too beautiful to eat! I definitely will be coming back to try the 16 course!",

Our hostess guided us through the Mansion to Joel Robuchon.   We had some Veuve Clicquot while we met the team and made our choices.  We quickly settled on the Degustation menu and wine pairings. The bread cart is impossible to resist (even knowing how much food was coming)! The first course was a very interesting sea urchin dish. The second course was violet artichoke and foie gras salad. The third course was a spectacular caviar trio! The fourth course was a meticulous egg Florentine with  Didier Dagueneau Pouilly-Fume. The fifth course was a brilliant scallop Saint-Jacques. The sixth course was a spectacular white truffle trio! The 2011 Jean Chartron Puligny-Montrachet was a very nice discovery. The seventh dish was a couple of perfect bites of lobster. The eighth dish was a wonderful Black Cod.  The spicy 2008 Joseph Roty Gevrey-Chamertin was a great contrast. The ninth dish was a duo of duck breast and foie gras. The earthiness of the 2000 Gaia Grosset paired well. The dessert courses were wonderful and the 2007 Chateau Rieussec Sauternes was spectacular! The dessert cart is also spectacular and impossible to resist! We were then given a cake to take home!  The restaurant reminds me of an elegant Parisian salon.   Thanks to the Joel Robochon team for a memorable evening of spectacular food!",

Everything was impressive from the insane bread cart all the way to the fantastic desserts.  My husband loved everything we had.  Some dishes were a bit lacking for me but the one thing I would go back for in a heartbeat is their le boif - Beef Chateaubriand and foie gras, \"Rossini\" style with aged Porto.  This is making me drool just thinking back to it.  This with the potato puree, OMG HEAVEN on a plate.  They offered a second serving but by the time we received this I was too full.  I contemplated still getting it even though it would have a caused a lot of physical pain, but didn't.  That is my one regret, pure decadence on a plate.    If you don't do the tasting, definitely get le boif.  It will not disappoint!    Update: they no longer have this item.  =(  This restaurant is beautiful, we sat on their \"outdoor\" patio, felt like we were transported to neverland quite magical. .  It was quiet and private, which I enjoyed.  The servers were great, super sweet and attentive.",

    "text": "When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!  My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence! Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!       As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right?   Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!  Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.    Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly.   Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!  Amuse Bouche \"sangria emulsion\" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!    Trio of Caviar  Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other.  Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.   Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.         Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.  Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup.   Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.  Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely.   Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read \"Happy Birthday\" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!  If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!  They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.  I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday.   But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!  Happy \"Birthday\" Eats, Part Deux!!",

The staff wasn't in sync, the food was too rich, the deserts were good but ...The house wines were average, average in a three star restaurant doesn't make it. With so many people being lactose intolerant you would think they would have almond or soy milk, not just cream for coffee...but nope. The glass diamond decorations scattered on the table blended in so much that the staff would accidentally place things on them and cause them to spill. We've now dined at 4 three Star restaurants, to me, this shouldn't have one star. If you do go here, while I can't say anything about the rest of the food, I can say, don't order the tasting menu.",

Every employee we interacted with was professional, friendly and helpful. Truly five-star service on every level.   We were seated at a lovely table next to the fireplace. The decor and ambience of the restaurant was superb. The cocktails we started the meal with were expertly crafted, and the skilled sommelier suggested two excellent wine pairings for my meal. The service was stellar from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. We both selected the five course tasting menu. Each dish was special and beautiful in its own way. The quality of ingredients and the care taken in the preparation was evident. The presentation was second to none. The bread cart and petit four cart were also amazing.  No detail was overlooked, including the birthday we were celebrating. We had a wonderful evening, and I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking truly fabulous cuisine and service.",

I won't go over each course, but trust me when I say that they were all virtually flawless. I will, however, highlight my favorite parts of this dining experience.  The service - impeccable and efficient. I've never seen a machine work so smoothly. The front and back waiters were exceptionally knowledgeable, warm and friendly. The only snootiness I detected was from the suited up captain. Luckily, all he did was present us with the menus and take our order.  The Bread cart - outrageous and extravagant. Hands down, the best bread I've ever had.  The butter - yes. You read correctly. The butter is imported from Brittany and had such a smooth, creamy texture and an almost yeasty, cheese-like taste.  The caviar course - hamachi with baby radish, olive oil and lemon; corn pudding with cream; crab salad served in a caviar tin...all topped with golden osetra caviar. Nuff said.  The cheese cart - they import their cheese from France (illegally I guess) and you can tell. I've never had cheese like this before. If there is ever a time to say OMG about anything, this is it. OH EM GEE.  Again, not to disparage the other courses, but in the interest of time and nonboredomness (?), those were my favorites.   A once in a lifetime meal.",

    "text": "I was incredibly disappointed with this restaurant. I was really excited to go eat at the \"most Michelin-starred chef\"'s famous Las Vegas restaurant. I've been lucky enough to eat at a number of Michelin-starred restaurants and well-known foodie havens. I'm not a picky eater, I'm willing to spend a lot on fun dinner experiences, and I generally don't leave a fancy restaurant unhappy. And yet, Robuchon was SO disappointing I had to come here and write about it.  First off, the service. We had one server (who served our bread and a few of the other dishes) who was pleasant and cordial. Not overly friendly or warm, you understand, just, you know, not actually unfriendly. (The bread, by the way, merits a mention - they had a dozen varieties wheeled around in a little cart, you could pick as many as you wanted and they'd warm them up for you, and they served it with hand carved butter, salt, and olive oil. It was wonderful, except for the fact that given the rest of the meal, I now suspect they hoped we'd fill up on bread and not taste anything else.) Our main server, on the other hand, was barely tolerating our presence (keep in mind we dressed appropriately, neither of us drank any alcohol so we were perfectly sober and not rowdy), and didn't seem to care that we were clearly not enthused with multiple dishes (more on that below).   Second, the ambiance- the dining room was actually lovely and very elegant.   On to the food. We each got two amuse bouche, two appetizers, one entree, and one dessert, so we sampled quite a bit of the menu.   The first amuse was a croquette-type thing (apologies for failing to have the specifics, I usually save my menus when I go to a nice dinner, but I didn't even bother doing that here), which was nice. The second amuse was an asparagus thing that I literally ate one bite of - the textures were off, the taste was not good.   Of the four appetizers, one smelled like cat food to me (though my husband liked it), one made me understand what food show judges mean when they say something tastes \"muddy\" (no specific flavor, just general bland and grit, which was so sad because it was supposed to have caramelized onion flan and I totally lost that flavor), one was okay, and one was not what I ordered (they had two caviar dishes on the menu: one called \"Caviar Imperial\" and one called salmon something. Both had salmon AND caviar, but one was under the \"hot\" appetizers portion of the menu, and one was under the \"cold\" section. I ordered the warm one, using the name on the menu for it - \"Caviar Imperial.\" They brought the other one (which I knew was wrong because it was cold), but when I questioned it they just told me that was the right dish, because it had caviar in it. I didn't fight them on it, because they already seemed kind of irritated with us and I didn't want to make a thing of it - it was early in the meal, and it tasted okay, so I let it go.)   The two entrees were good, but not particularly memorable or stellar (as you might expect from a meal costing $200). The desserts were similarly tasty, but something I could find in a nice-ish French place at home, not something worthy of a Michelin starred-chef.   Overall, our fried chicken and waffles at Hash House a Go-Go the next night were infinitely more satisfying.  I don't know if Robuchon is simply resting on its laurels, if Vegas is not the place to come for good food, or if this was just an off night. All I know is I am staying away from anything with that name in the future.",

This time I don't know if it is because none of us ordered wine (we don't drink any alcohol and they would get less tip because bill would be less so they weren't happy, I don't know) but the service was horrible and I will never return to this place again.  They didn't check and ask how things were. When we asked to have 2nd round of bread toasted, they made a snooty comment \"we usually only heat the first bread serving and not the second but since you asked I will do it for you but we usually don't\".  Seriously? If you are going to do it, why make such comment, I found it annoying.  Gave us the check before bringing out dessert. Over all, didn't feel welcomed. Maybe just an isolated incident, but enough that I won't be returning.  I used to tell all my friends about this place, no more. When you pay so much money, service that is less than exceptional is disappointing.  The food however was fantastic as the first time.",

The only reservation we could get was at 10pm and we went for it since that would be our only chance while in Las Vegas.  We went for the 1 course menu since we weren't very hungry being 10 oclock at night but even with the 1 course, you get so much more!  We started off with the amuse bouche of caviar with lobster gelee and crab meat.  This was such a wonderful treat.  It was a teaser for the pallete.  Then the best thing ever happened... the infamous bread cart.  I died and went to carb heaven because every bread, brioche, loaf and bun on the cart looked fantastic.  The girl who was there throughout our dinner let us choose 4 breads and even warmed them up for us... I started with a bacon mustard, a rosemary brioche, a baguette and milk bread.... alllllll soooo delish especially with their in house butter, that was so good.  Then she came back and asked if we wanted more!!  I got 3 more delicious breads... a puff pastry, basil brioche, and a guyere cheese bread... I think I got full off the bread alone.  We were then served our courses.  I had chose the veal cheeks which were cooked in a thai spiced bouillon with couscous... the meat melted in my mouth.  We were also served Robuchon's infamous pommes puree which was heaven in your mouth.  I have not stopped thinking about them since.  I wanted to lick the plate clean. LOL.  Our dessert course followed... I had the chocolate dessert with coffee ice cream with little gold krispies on it, it was really good and not too sweet.  After our dessert we were spoiled with their candy cart which was filled with all types of goodies from truffles to caramels to marshmallows and cream puffs... yum.  We were also celebrating a birthday and they brought out the best birthday cake ever that was kind of an ice cream passionfruit light flavor that was amazing.  And if all that was not enough we got to take home a goodie bag with a chocolate bar that was also wonderful... Dark chocolate and a mix of nuts... yum.  The service here was impeccable, everyone was super  friendly and checked up on us often, but not too much where it makes you feel uncomfortable. The girl who served us most of our foods and the carts, joked around with us but in a professional way, so it made us feel at home.  This truly was a wonderful dinner.",

    "text": "Yes... 5 STARS. Count Em!   Now I can't say that this is the best restaurant I've ever experienced -- but here in the US -- it is definitely 1 of the top 3. EVER.  We went at the end of March 2010 when we were visting L.V. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental this time (will post that review sometime soon) instead of our usual fave 4Seasons and the MGM sent their limo to pick us up and deliver us to Joel Robuchon -- with a private escort thru \"The Mansion\".  I don't gamble very much -- but just being there for that short time -- I wished I were a high-roller. They're the only ones who get to really stay there. But I digress.  The food was fab-u-lous. We did the $135 2-course prix fixe meal -- which believe me -- unless you're totally starving -- the amount of food is PUH-LEN-TY enuf.  First things first. The amuse bouche (in French it literally means \"tickle the tounge\") or so I was told when I was in St. Jean Cap Ferrat. If you're lucky enuf -- maybe they'll have the one we got. It looked a little crazy when it arrived at the table. A round tin can that said Joel Robuchon at the top -- and when you opened it -- on the top all you could see was caviar. But they gave you this tin by itself with no blini -- just the delicious bread from the bread cart -- and no mother of pearl spoon -- just a regular flatware spoon. So, we were a bit confused.  Until we finally decided to dig in. That's when we discovered that it was a thin layer of \"caviar\" on top of the most delectable pieces of crab that u'll ever get for free in your life!  I'm thinking it's either bowfin, hackleback, or a dyed tobiko caviar -- not even mississippi paddlefish or even farm-raised sturgeon -- cuz they give you quite a bit -- and tobiko has a clean taste -- almost like sashimi -- not that salty caviar-y taste that some people do not like. In a word... DELICIOUS.  Next up: for me: I chose the seared scallop appetizer. Makes you wanna smack somebody, Ba-by! He had the pea soup. I tasted some but I've never been a fan of pea soup (memories from the Exorcist I suppose?) but he thought it was magnif.  Main course: Me: The spiny Lobster. Maybe the second or 3rd best tasting lobster I've ever ever had. Cuz making great lobster is more than a notion. Most of the time, it's either too dry or understeamed. This 4 hour boat trip I took in Hawaii a few years ago had the best plain-old delishes lobster I've ever had. But Joel Robuchon wasn't shabby either. & They gave you plenty. Not stingy at all. Especially when combined with the MASHED POTATOES they paired it with.  See if you can go in there one day and just order a plate of MASHED POTATOES. You'd give them 5 stars just for that! It's the smoothest potatoes u'll ever eat. But I have a feeling there are pounds and pounds of butter, heavy cream & milk mixed into those puppies. It's not diet food.  HE: had the lamb chops. I'm greedy so I tasted those, too. HE'S tried the lamb chops at nearly every place we've ever dined. Now Joel Robuchon is his top pick EVER! They kind of tasted like sophisticated back-yard bbq chops with a spicy middle-eastern zing to them. Very tender. Worth having if you don't mind eating one of the stars of the Serta mattress commercials. Baaaa!   Then... our wonderful waiter -- at our request, brought out just a bit of the lamb jus to top our potatoes with. Took the taters to a whole nother level of yum -- but their tatoes just plain. Just as good.  I had the cheese: cuz I was so excited to see that they actually had epoisses (so hard to find it outside of France -- even Melisse in L.A. rarely has it on their cart) and I got a chance to pair it with some more of that rosemary bread. He had  some sort of tahitan pinapple coconut contraption that he just culdn't keep his lips off.  The down-side: Our food for 2 was $270. Expected. But the drinks set us back BIG TIME!!! He had 1 glass of champagne: $35. He had 1 half bottle of red wine: $55. He had 1 glass of scotch: $27. I had a pot of hot tea: $20. and 1 glass of (virgin) lemonade: $7.  Be careful cuz it's a 3 hour + meal -- and we discovered that the drinks will set you back as much as the food. That glass of champagne they offer you at the beginning of the meal IS NOT COMPLIMENTARY. Don't do it!!! I'm sure the food taste just as good with a bottle of water for the table...  Grand total including drinks, food, taxes & tip:$558 for 2 people. But you get a box of cookies at the end. Oh -- and if you get the limo -- I think it's only fair to tip the driver at least $10-15 Each Way. But that's just me... ENJOY!",

    "text": "This place takes your money faster than the casino.   The food is Michelin 3 star good, but damn is it it expensive. After eating at French Laundry, I said the same thing, but felt it was a deal; here not so much.   The decor and details are all there. I kept chuckling to myself every time  someone entered the restaurant, as the serene atmosphere was invaded by the noise and trash just outside the door. The contrast is really quite extreme.  The service is technically impeccable, but is missing its humanity. It seems their approach to training staff is to dunk them in a vat of French snobbery and call it a day. Seriously, the entire French population of Vegas works here. It just lacks the understated grace that is French Laundry.  Should this review be listed under The French Laundry?",

    "text": "Not quite a 5 star restaurant in my book. It could be perhaps, that I had the pleasure of experiecing French Laundry beforehand and so I kept comparing the two experiences.   I had the 5 course tasting menu. I actually thought that they offered a separate dinner menu in case you didn't want to obtain the chef's tasting menu. Unfortunately, they didn't. They offered only a 5 course and what sounds like a very fulfilling 16 course chef menu.   The food was good, but it didn't exactly blow me away. I was disappointed with our last course as it had a combination of what seemed like cumin and curry spices mixed together. I didn't finish the last course and was a bit ashamed that I did that b/c I didn't want the chef to feel insulted.   I also thought that we would get some little chef surprise course in between our 5 courses, but we didn't. The only time they kept surprising us with all kinds of food was at the end during dessert. In addition to our dessert that came with the chef's tasting menu, we were given a selection of eclectic desserts on a cart as well as treated to gelato.   I was surely satisfied, but a bit disappointed overall. I really thought that I was going to be blown away by this restaurant especially since I read the raving reviews about the Chef Robuchon. What sucks is that the price I paid for a 5 course tasting menu is about the same if not a a tiny bit more that I would pay at French Laundry and I would get a whole different adventure there.",

    "text": "I took my wife and two friends here for my wife's birthday. In the last couple of years we have dined at numerous Michelin starred restaurants including Le Cinq in Paris and the three starred Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London. Having read all the reviews we were very much looking forward to dining at Joel Robuchon while in Vegas.  First of all - the limo transfer wasn't offered to us so I didn't know anything about it. I emailed them to ask if they would be able to send the limo to make the short trip (about three quarters of a mile) from our hotel to the MGM Grand but my email was ignored and as of today I still haven't had a response.  They must have received my emails as they knew that one of our party was vegetarian.  The restaurant has an intimate and very plush interior, and the decor is largely tasteful and elegant, with the exception of the fake candles on the table and the celebrity pictures that are dotted around. We were overlooked during the meal by a black and white signed photo of David Copperfield! I'd expect that in a city centre pizza restaurant but not here.  Regards the food, the bread trolley was hugely impressive with the breads delicious and warm. Following that we had the 5 course menu and while absolutely fine, I didn't have one course that blew me away.   The service is snooty and doesn't put you at ease. The sign of a REALLY classy place is that you are made to feel welcome regardless of who you are. This wasn't the case here. Only one of the waiters that came to the table looked happy to serve us, the others looked sour-faced. The comical highlight of the night was when one of the waiters decided that my friend's bag looked messy sitting under the table so he bought a miniature ottoman to put it on. The bag received better service than we did.  The bill came to over $1000 for the four of us, and that was without any wine as none of us drink. I would have been happy to pay this IF it had been special and exciting but I'm afraid it wasn't.",

    "text": "Joel Robuchon is 1 of the 2  three Michelin stars rated restaurants on the West Coast. I have to say that my experience at Joel Robuchon was very different than my experience at The French Laundry.  My wonderful experience with Joel Robuchon started as soon as the love of my life and I stepped out of our hotel at the Bellagio. I was surprised to see the MGM limousine waiting there for us.  We were driven to MGM Grand but had entered through the private electronic gates to the Mansion, which they opened via radio communication between our driver and the gatekeeper.  Once parked at the Mansion, butlers came and greeted us and walked us through the courtyard, then through the front room before entering  the hotel wing towards Joel Robuchon.  Walking through parts of the Mansion was incredible and made me feel like a royalty.  The furniture, chandeliers, and the entire decor inside Joel Robuchon were glamorous! Of course we wanted to try everything we could eat at Joel Robuchon!  Service were top notch, and we had asked the Sommelier to pick whatever red wine he thought would accompany our meat, and he did a fantastic job!   I will not list our entire tasting menu here, but we started off with champagne and caviar over crab meat, and that was just heavenly! I was very impressed by the bread cart that came to our table with at least 20 types of breads and my favorite was the saffron bread.    All the food was so delicious and well prepared. Presentations were fantastic, and the services were perfect! Everyone was friendly, helpful, and had eyes for every single detail.  All I had to do was lift a finger, and one of the staff came and asked if he could take a picture for my BF and I.  Where else can you find service like this other than Joel Robuchon?  We had plenty of the best tasting food one could get that evening. Just when I had forgotten about the bread cart, and had no more room left after several plates of seafood and meat, came the cheese cart!!  Then, they prepared an entire ice cream cake for my birthday!!!    I am not sure how much better can this meal be.  Hold on, I don't think I can move anymore, can someone please help me up so that I can walk around a little to digest all this great food? As I returned to the table from the restroom, the chocolate cart came!!  I was asked to pick as many chocolates as I wanted!!! I was in heaven and back and in heaven again!  Joel Robuchon is truly the best restaurant, with excellent service, & amazing food. This is the best experience ever. Thank you D for a fabulous birthday! And thank you Joel for the loaf of pistachio cake that you had wrapped to go for us.",

    "text": "Wanted to eat at the Robuchon outpost in Las Vegas for quite a while...  I was not disappointed.  The bar occupys up to about 40 guests with well informed servers presenting your food to the guest over the counter.  It becomes obvious that you are at a Robuchon's vision of being a japanese  style counter chef.  But with Robuchon's stern eye in the room,  his food is complete in all forms but none.  The crispy thin tart of sweet onion and pancetta was offered with a couple of perfectly cooked quail eggs that burst with the mellow yellow yolk.  It was so delicious and it was garnished with a nice pairing of sorrel greens.  He had the fancy stuff too.  Such as the quail egg stuffed with foie gras and served with truffle potatoe puree.  Man it was good.  Very small and expensive... but it was worth it.  I think. One dish stood out above the rest and that was the steak tar tar... Basically a raw burger patty with the fixings ... dijon. onions. pickles.  s&p... Served with french fries and a tiny little wedge of iceburg lettuce, I really began to think I was eating a burger and fries.    The presentation is very precise and the line cooks take there time to get things right on the plates.  They move fast but take their time on the plates.  A sign of a good experience to come.    But it just so happened that he was there that weekend and I got to meet the icon... practically a god to most people.  He is the inventor of new cusine almost.  But more then all of that, he is just a great chef.  I found he was a very nice man and up next  is hopefully the Mansion next door.  When I asked him how it was... he just smiled looked at me and nodded his head up and down with a silly little smile on his face and I trusted his every nod.",

    "text": "I took six of my employees here to experience their signature menu with wine pairing.  This was not an inexpensive endeavor.  Counting tip $5,600 and change.  This being said it was a very enjoyable experience.  Ambiance and service were superb.  Bread cart was a delight.  Suggest you let the attendant provide you with an assortment instead of picking a particular bread.  There are just too many good ones.  The universal favorite dish was the lobster on the shellfish trio.  Another favorite was the risotto topped with gold leaf.  There really was not a bad course some just stood out more than others.  By the time the signature desert cart rolled around, I was looking for things that could fit in my pocket as I couldn't eat another bite.  Fortunately they had wrapped caramels that did the trick.  Right before departing, we were each given a gift bag with a copy of the menu and a delightful lemon cake.  Couple of other points of note, wine pairings were well done and they were not stingy on refilling glasses.  We opted for 5:30 reservations and did not depart until 10:30.  Five hours of eating and drinking.  I make this point because for me at least it would not necessarily be enjoyable for a date night.  We needed a group for long long of a period of time.  Last but not least, while I was expecting and willing to pay the 400 plus for food person and an extra almost 300 per person for wine pairing, there was one charge that caught me off guard and actually bothered me a great deal.  When we were initially seated, a waiter came around with a bottle of champagne and asked if we would like a glass.  The three of us who arrived early happily obliged.  When the bill came these were not only included but were $45 per glass.  Might seem like a small thing to many of you but to me this was not handled correctly.  You don't come around with an open bottle of champagne and offer without revealing there is a charge and a significant charge at that.  I have been to many a nice restaurant and this was a first.  Would have received five stars if not for this.",

    "text": "Try this restaurant if you get the chance.  Even a sliver of a chance.  Near the end of the meal, my wife asks me how I would rate the desert - L'Orange which is an orange infused with caramel jus, etc - and I said, after a moment of thought, it's a five.  She points out that I have rated every course we had a five, and that is the first time I have ever done that.  My meal was:  The amuse bouche which is all it's cracked up to be - crab, caviar and hint of fennel.  The subtlety is beautiful and the balance pitch-perfect.  I choose four breads from the cart - bacon, herb brioche, cheese brioche and saffron baguette.  They toast them and bring them back.  Terrific breads, the herb brioche in particular was flaky and light and wonderful.  The famous La Chataigne soup.  I always worry about French soups which are often too rich for me.  This was rich, but I really enjoyed it - and the couple of whole chestnuts resting on the bottom.  A feast of textures and tastes.  A King Crab salad served with avocado and several other accompaniments.  Like many of the dishes, this was so well balanced and really reintroduced you to the beauty of the individual ingredients - the vinaigrette was bright and really drew out other flavors.  Veal Cheeks in a Thai broth with couscous.  The broth was deeply flavored with lemongrass and reminded me of how wonderful it can be.  The veal was very rich, and the dish scrumptious overall.  L'Orange, as I mentioned above, was terrific and though sweet a nice ending to a rich (but not too rich) meal.  The Mignardise carte was terrific.  I read in a few reviews people were or felt limited in what they could try - I had about 8 or 9 and loved each one - after I choose what I wanted, I asked if there were others I shouldn't miss, and our server suggested a couple extra to try.  The passionfruit and raspberry chocolates were standouts, and the ginger and orange peel also were great.  My wife eats gluten-free - and there were great about this.  Our server know many of the options, but checked on the few he didn't, and even went through the mignardises a second time to point out the ones she  could eat one by one.  She also had a great meal, although her sole dish was merely good, not quite as memorable as other courses.  The service overall was wonderful (I'm running out of superlatives), the limo and walk through the Resort was beautiful, but the food was the star.  A truly outstanding meal.",

Went balls-out: both of us did the 16-course degustation menu (I did the \"regular\" one and my wife did the Vegetarian one) and we shared the $995 wine paring (there are three different pairing price levels: $245, $545, and $995). Ab-so-lutely incredible. The service was top notch and it was all we could do to not ask for more bread from their crazy display cart! Even when it came to ordering hot tea, they trim the tea leaves in front of you and brew it on the table. If that's not fresh tea, I don't know what is. I can't justify coming back unless I won the lottery, but it was absolutely memorable from the pick-up in their gold limo to staggering back through the Mansion at night, loved every minute of the experience. Don't half-ass this place: do it right. Worth every penny. If not my favorite restaurant of all time, it's a very very close 2nd.  Don't feel pressured to wear a suit and tie; I wore a black jacket with slacks and a nice shirt and my wife wore a nice little black dress and we were fine.",

I have to admit that I loved the bread and cheese cart, which I thought was the best part of the meal.   However, the rest of the entrees where bland or uneventful.   I lived in NY for a couple of years and have gone to all of the great 3 star Michelin restaurants there and I think that this place does not compare to the places I have been in NY and is twice the price.   I don't really care so much about the cost, but when I am paying a rediculous amount for OK food I will avoid this place from now on.",

I came here with a small group of friends, and we all had a great time.  Every dish on the tasting menu (I loved the seafood carpaccio and the baby kumomoto oysters) was delicious, and the waiters were knowledgeable and fun to talk to.  And if you like wine, go for the wine pairing, they have a great recommendation for ice wine.  We even sat at a table next to Larry King.  It's pretty casual here, unlike many other fine dining restaurants, so it felt a little more inviting.  I'm definitely coming back here the next time I go to Vegas.  Note: At the time of this review, it was originally for L'Atalier by Joel Robuchon.  Don't know how it ended up here...",

They continuously came around with their well-known bread cart.  My faves were the bacon bread and the mini croissant. Make sure you pace yourself with the bread! I was so full by the 4th plate!",

I indulged in the baked bread selection, mint pea soup, artichoke salad, lobster red curry, cheese selection, and lastly desserts!  Everything was amazing and I love being able to choose bread off a cart that was baked that day.  I would pass on the cheese selection and adding an extra dessert.  Being from the SF Bay Area we have superb cheese and freshly baked desserts and I actually wasn't that impressed with those particular items.   This is one of the most expensive meals of the year as well at around $300 with gratuity.",

How people (chefs) can make food explode in your mouth with flavor is truly incredible. It's a French restaurant (Duhhhh), but I was thinking about the animated movie Ratatouille. Because it's based in Paris and about French food. Anyhow , I'm rambling.   Bottom line! Is it expensive, you bet your rear end it is. Is it worth it ? Hell Yes!!!    Wine selection is whatever your heart and budget can desire.

I cannot recall her name, but what I can say is she was rude, short and unapologetic! I wanted to find out if the limo was able to take my party to and from the restaurant. The very rude woman told me I would have had to call 24 hours in advance to reserve the limo. I had attempted to take care of this the day prior, but the hotel (Aria) informed me there would be a charge (one-way = $99!!!!). I had called one last time (on my own) because I remembered there was no charge when we visited the restaurant for our honeymoon in 2012. I informed the woman of our reservation (made MONTHS in advance), and she proceeded to tell me my reservation had not even been confirmed! I was livid! I had spoken to \"Donna\" on the Friday before to CONFIRM my reservation for FIVE people. We were all having the 16-course degustation menu. Let's just say I was VERY UPSET. If I had not made a deposit for this dinner, I would have canceled!!!!!! The woman told me there were NO exceptions, even though we were about to spend quite a lot of money that evening. Thankfully, our concierge at the Aria Sky Suites gave us a complimentary limo ride to and from the restaurant!  On to the dinner. It was absolutely divine! We all ate the 16-course degustation menu. I have two food allergies, and they accommodated my needs perfectly!   At the end of the evening, they gave every person in my party a customized menu for us to bring home. It was a very nice touch. The food experience almost made up for the limo issue...almost.",

    "text": "***500th Review***  Wow, where to start? The evening began with an awesome ride in the famous gold limo and a short tour of the Mansion. A hot chick dressed in a kimono leads you through  the Mansion and into food fantasy land. Sadly food fantasy land is incredibly ugly - done up in shades of pale pink and purple with lace doilies everywhere. We ate here 2 weeks after Easter and there were Easter eggs everywhere. Pink, purple, easter eggs.EW.  Take out the pastel Easter theme and this place is flawless ! We did 2 courses for $135 and I'd really say 1 course for $105 or 2 courses for $135 is the way to go! You do NOT need to order dessert. Trust me.   I could go on all day about the bread. The 35 choices. The fact that they heat up your bread for you. The butter carved lovingly off of a huge loaf with salt sprinkled on top. For us carboholics, you've just reached nirvana. Be careful, however, there's still food coming!  The amuse bouche is crab and caviar. Delicious and impeccable.  Course 1: It's between here and Alex for the best sea scallops in town. If you're a scallop person, by all means don't miss these. The king crab salad was equally amazing.  Course 2: So I made the mistake of getting the lobster. While it was great, my husband ordered the foie gras wrapped in guinea hen. This was the single best dish I've ever had in my life. It sounded blah, but WOW, life changing dish. Like close your eyes in ecstasy dish! So good in fact that for $40 my Dad and I ordered one to share in addition to our lobster. The only travesty is that dish is too small ! I could eat 3 of those , but then I'm a glutton.   Dessert: So like I said, don't order one. They bring out this cart of magical delights that's included with your meal, each one more fabulous than the last . FOURTY choices of mini treats. Each one hand painted in metallic colors.. wow.. beautiful, tasty, there really were no duds here. Tahitian vanilla caramels, banana filled chocolates (with actual fresh bananas inside!), white chocolate dipped pineapple... We got 5 or so each, but we should have gotten 10 !   So I'm going to leave you with some help if you're trying to decide between this place and Alex (my other favorite place in Vegas). I liked Joel a little bit better because  *limo *guinea hen (best dish of my life) *bread cart *dessert cart  However, the rest of the diners in my party preferred Alex. I can definitely agree on an aesthetic standpoint - Alex is just a better dining environment.  I didn't have any of the best dishes of my life at Alex, HOWEVER, Alex overall was more food for the price and every single thing was fantastic. In simple terms, Joel's food ranged from 4 to 5 depending on the dish. At Alex, everything was a 4.5 .   My husband summed it up this way: Next time we want a nice dinner, call Joel and see if they have the guinea hen/foie. If they do - go to Joel for the $105 menu and just get that, the bread, the amuse, and the dessert cart! Otherwise, Alex all the way.   PS - posted lots of pics. I'm not a big picture person but this place was so jaw dropping I couldn't resist.",

We had the 5 course menu (Menu A, $250) which included the bread cart, amuse bouche, two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert and sweets. We ordered several dishes that had a supplement price so the total bill came up to $400+ per person before tips.   What to eat: truffles, caviar and foie gras all the way.",

The food and overall ambiance were stellar, but the service the night we went was quite lacking. Seems there was some breakdown of communication among the multitude of staff, which left less time for basic service items (empty drinks, checking in, asking about dishes, etc.).  All in all a pleasant experience, but really not one worthy of Michelin stars. Happy to pay $$$$ for restaurants when everything is above and beyond, but this experience just ended a little flat.",

We walked in to a little waiting room/bar area and a very professional bartender asked what we would like and brought them over. I actually spilled a little of the martini on my leg and he was so quick to help.  We were seated perfectly on time to our reservation. I could go on for days...they servers were excellent we had like 4 servers and even a wine guy whose only job was to explain and help pair our different courses with types and flavors of wine. I've never heard to many great adjectives in my life.   The restaurant only had a handful of occupied tables but still required a reservation which means they carefully prepare everything with the fullest care. They didn't just have a bread basket, but literally an entire card of fresh bread to chose on, and the butter was literally imported from a different country, just for different flavors.   The 16 courses were each amazing in their own way, it started with some appetizer like dishes (all very small since there's 16 courses) and then went into fish and seafood dishes (first time trying caviar!) , then into different types of red meats and eventually desert. My favorite was a tiny 2 by 1 inch piece of steak that literally had the most amazing flavor. Anyways...you get the point this place is amazing.  Me and my boyfriend have seriously considered flying out to Vegas just to dine at the Joel. We constantly compare every other restaurant to the Joel and really I actually hate eating out now that i know what truly great food and service is like.    So you might think that for a place like this, it would be very expensive. But if you put it in perspective it is actually cheap. (We had a bill of about $1400) In Vegas you spend 5K on a small bottle service area with a couple bottles of average alcohol and some cute girls mixing drinks for you (don't get me wrong i love that whole part) except you are getting minimal service. We spend nothing compared to what you spend on a bottle service and we got excellent service for a 4 hour dining experience with servers and wine guys basically taking care of you all night.  So I think the pricing is more than fair!! Check this place out, hope this was helpful.",

    "text": "Dined here back in March, and are still talking about it. We celebrated my beau's belated birthday here, and made a note when making a reservation.  We did the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu at $425/Person, complete with limo ride and hostess escort through the very prestigious MGM garden. It's a shame to miss it if you are staying at the MGM, the mansions are gorgeous (plus there is no other way I would ever have the chance to be there). Our limo brought us through the tall cast iron gates, where we were greeted the mansion's own hostess. She guided us through a very beautiful hallway, into the gardens. It was like a scene out of \"secret garden,\" it took our breath away. More hallways, and turns. We got glimpses of the very private gambling rooms of the privileged and pricey artwork. Finally though another set of iron gates and we were inside the MGM making a left through the doors of Joel Robuchon.   The dining area is set with authentic Parisian flare. Many different textiles flirting with blooming bouquets, crystals and silverware. The French truly have a way of putting things together without it feeling like clutter. Very limited number of tables, I assume to keep the intimacy. Simply put, it was quite sexy.   Service was elegant and polite. Everyone is quite soft spoken, and very overly hospitable. A server will adjust your table if you need to excuse yourself to the powder room. They change all cutlery and china between courses.   The tasting started off with the bread cart, with every kind of bread, roll and loaf imaginable. We didn't want to fill up to much and had a modest taste. Our selection was brought into the back and was heated. Each was to die for.   The menu changes seasonally, and you can see a breakdown of my menu items in the photo gallery. I'll just note here that there was an abundance of foie gras and caviar. It ended with two desserts and we had a lot of trouble getting through the later half of the menu. Completely stuffed to the brim.  Then came the surprise birthday cake, complete with candles.  Then......the mother of all dessert carts. Bite sized bliss in every shape and form. Chocolates, cupcakes, macaroons, creme puffs, the list goes on. At this point we didn't have enough room for anything else so they kindly packed us a sampling to take home.  It finally finished off Le The, the tea cart. Full leaf teas, still growing in the pot. They trim, hand wash, then soak the tea leaves before brewing. Lemon thyme was delicious and helped us feel less bloated.  We were sent home with smiles on our faces, food in our bellies, a gift bag with a bar of Joel Robuchon Chocolat, and our menu with our names and date here for keepsake. The whole experience took close to 4 hours (the limo ride was 30 min from Red Rock). Well worth the price. Joel Robuchon is undoubtedly worthy of the three Michelin stars it holds.",

    "text": "OMG. Such pleasant and patient service. The waiters and hostesses were awesome. The food was excellent. The balance of flavors, the freshness of the produce and the choice of menu options, all made this a very interesting and fun foody experience. The portions seemed so big. I was glad that I ordered just one entree because the the first 2 appetizers were so filling. I had fish for the main course and found it difficult to finish. Hubby got the 2 entree with cheese course option. He was elated. Everything was so much fun. Even the cheese cart was only rivaled by what we get in fine restaurants in France. There was so much food In fact, I couldn't possibly eat the amazing chocolate souffle (hubby ordered one). It was so incredibly light and fluffy, but also very large. So, the very kind waiter packed up a special treat for me to take home, in case I had room for dessert later in the evening. We enjoyed our evening emensely and will definitely be back. The only sad part of the night was finding out that they don't have real fois gras. they only have a terrine (pate) of fois gras :(   This was a huge disappointment!! and the reason why this restaurant gets only 4 stars. Please don't advertise what you can't deliver.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary at this wonderful fine dining restaurant. The experience can only be described with one word, \"wow.\" A good friend of ours recommended this special restaurant for our special occasion. Walking into the front door, we totally forgot that this restaurant is situated inside a busy and noisy casino. We were greeted by a warm smile and led to our seats. Our seats were out in the Vertical Garden surronded by green ivy going up on the wall.  We were handed two menus for select from. One menu is the 16 course degustation menu for $385 per person and a prix fixe menu that ranges from 2 course to 6 course meal to choose from. You really cannot go wrong with either menu. Since our reservation is at 8:30 pm, we thought the 16 course menu may go on too long. I decided to go with the 4 course and my wife went with the 2 course. The waiter were very helpful assisting us with our menu selections. My 4 course meal selection were Le Foie Gras duo mele d'artichaut violet en salade aux copeaux de parmigiano reggiano (Foie gras and violet artichoke salad with parmesan shavings) for appetizer, La Chataigne et le foie gras dans un fin veloute soyeux sur un voile virtuel de lard fume (Light chestnut veloute with foie gras, smoked lardons foam) for soup, Le Bar et poulpe aux fins aromates avec un jus de citronnelle, jeunes poireaux et artichaut (Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass, baby leek and artichoke) for main course and La Banane givree et caramelisee au vieux rhum ambre et une emulsion cremeuse de lait de coco (Banana and passion fruit cream under a dark rum granite and coconut foam) for dessert. My wife selected Le Homard en salade mimosa de chou-fleur fondant a l'aigre doux et des croutons dores (Lobster salad with sweet and sour cauliflower mimosa and croutons) for appetizer, Le Buf la noix d'entrecote emincee, epinards au wasabi et legumes arlequins (Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers) for main course and Le Chocolat grand cru a la glace Arabica, riz souffle aux zestes de citron confit (Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit) for dessert.  After the tough menu selection, we then faced more choices. The waiter pushed the Le Pain (bread cart) with at least 20 different type of bread to select from. Then it came as a surprise, with the bread the waiter brought out Le Caviar to go with the bread. This is really the first time my wife and I had caviar, and it was excellent. I don't want to get into the detail of each dish that we had for reasons that one, I am not a food critic and two, you have to have it yourself to really know how wonderful each dish were. After the dessert, the waiter came by to show us this beautiful anniversary cake complimentary of the chief. The cake were to die for. Just when we thought that we could not be surprised any more, the waiter push Les Mignardises (charcolate cart) with over 42 different gourment charcolates.  The night was filled with surprises and excitment. I am so glad that we spent our 10th anniversary at this fantastic restaurant.",

    "text": "Had the 16 course meal.  By far the most epic restaurant dining experience I've ever had.  This place set a new standard for me.    Highlights: 1.  30 minutes before our reservation, the restaurant calls and asks for our location so they can send their limo to pick us up.  Brings us through the back \"Mansion\" part of MGM (where Joel Robuchon and whales stay), with a mini tour/pictures of the gardens, living areas, and stuff. 2.  Restaurant is gorgeous.  Tasteful colors, themes, great environment for different types of dinner engagements.   3.  Service is excellent.  Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive.  Even had a pleasant voice and way of talking.  When we first sat down, apparently there was some drunk chick being a little loud at a table nearby that just left.  Our waiter comes by apologizing and asking if there's anything they can do.  I joke around about getting a free bottle of wine and they actually gave us one!  Not only that, they actually chose one that would go well with what we ordered. 4.  16 course meal changed the way I view food.  It's not just about how good something tastes when it goes in your mouth.  But there was actually a progression of tastes and balances throughout the course of the meal.  Each next course complimented or contrasted really well with the previous one.  So much art and complexity in this meal.   5.  Chocolate cart is pretty amazing and I don't even like sweets.  But we already had too much to eat and drink by this point.  They gave us some boxes so we could take a bit of everything to go. 6.  Dining experience took the whole night.  I think about 4 hours long.  Going into it, there was no way I would think a $1000 dinner would be worth it.  I changed my mind after.    Thanks for an unforgettable experience, Joel Robuchon.",

    "text": "Three star michelin in North America is rare. French Laundry, Joel Robuchon and few spots NYC....that's about it.   Expectations are high and Joel's outpost in Vegas doesn't disappoint. The recession has certainly had its effect here as I doubt many can dine on 16 courses at $385 anymore without the expense account. They now offer a variation of smaller 2-6 course menus. Simpler and perhaps with more reason. So how does this compare in the world of French Laundry, Per Se, Alain Ducasse, El Bulli?   Pretty well.  We were staying at the MGM so the gold limo and private entrance we'll have to assume are pretty sweet. The quaint, regal homely dining room is impressive and the purple banquet seating is perfect for letting the food settle in. But the ultimate key is the food.  Highlights -  Bread cart - amazing selection, sample at least 3-4 pieces, the sweet rolls were buttery goodness Truffled langoustine ravioli with chopped cabbage (Suppl. $30) - amazing pocket of bursting flavour, well worth the suppl and the best app Duck and seared foie gras with cherries and fresh almonds - my love affair with foie continues with this amazing preparation Spring lamb skewer with sweet spices, vegetables with lemon confit (Suppl. $25) - easily the best main, so tender and not a hint of gameyness. Moka - The (i.e. French candy/chocolate cart) - This sweets cart just amazes. Like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory in French, I couldn't resist the hazelnut chocolates and truffles.  So, it is expensive and it is a dining experience worth the price. The food was top notch, the service was impeccable and the bread/sweet carts are an offering unique onto itself. I'll be back once the credit markets free up again.",

The Sixteen course tasting menu with second tier wine pairings was quite good. The wait staff were far more reserved than at any other michelin three star restaurant I've ever been to, but they did a great job none the less - the sommelier, however, was a lot of fun and brought out a few additional wines to taste with each dessert course.  The dining room is beautiful and nearly matches the space at alan ducasse au plaza athenee in Paris for aesthetic value. Dinner at Joel Robuchon is the best fine dining experience Las Vegas has to offer.",

The restaurant is decorated like an eccentric frenchman got a hold of Elton John's Amex, and binged.  Its truly amazing, and I pray to G-d that my home is a fraction as cool as the royal purple that engulfed me that night.  I was lucky enough to experience the Degustation which was totally, and utterly customized to my allergies.  No egg, no dairy, no wheat, no seafood or shellfish.  I also set my reservation about three weeks in advance to give the kitchen time to prepare for substitutions.  There was no additional charge, or qualms.    After ordering a bottle of wine, a cart arrived with about 20 different types of breads, pretzels, brioche... *sigh*.  It was simply beautiful.  Although I didn't sample any, my dining companion wolfed down probably 8 different kinds of breads happily.    My 3 favorite dishes in order that they arrived:   La Tomate-en salade, huile d'olive au basilic, tomate et mozzarella en gelee - like a cold cold caprese party in your mouth   Les Asperges- royale tremblotante de morille au vin d'Arbois - asparagus with fantastic morel mushrooms  Les Petits Pois - en fin veloute rafraichi a la menthe poivree sur un voile d'oignon doux - a soup of peas with an interesting onion foam  Its amazing how simple on the palate can turn into something so incredibly satisfying.  Remember to take your time...   Course after course arrived, and we killed 2 bottles of wine.  Its called a tasting menu for a reason.  I remember liking everything with beef, and the vegetables were insanely crisp, yet well seasoned, and the colours were so vibrant.  Each new course had us 'oooh-ing' and 'awwww-ing' in complete ecstasy.  I believe the bone marror took the cake... Despite the price making the Degustation a once (maybe twice) in a lifetime experience, I do believe it was worth every single dollar.    The best part was the dessert cart.  Its like something out of Willy Wonka, if Willy was really Joel, and you were really 10 years old again.  The light that shines out your eyes after spying a cart of chocolate and sweets can only be described as lust for another tickling of your palate that I have not experienced since.  I wish I could fully articulate how much I truly loved this restaurant, and more so this experience.  The staff is .. well French... yet, knowledgeable, and were extremely concerned for my well being, and sensitive to my allergies.  Dinner took about 4 and a half hours, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.   Upon leaving I was gifted with a menu to remind me of my recent gluttony, and a HUGE dense lemon cake.  It was large enough to feed at least 8 people, and I did, indeed snack on this cake for the entire time I was in Vegas.  It was a sweet reminder of a meal I shall never, ever forget.",

    "text": "I just got back from dinner with my wife a couple of hours ago and I could not wait to review it. I'm not a 'foodie.' I can appreciate fine dining as much as the next guy, but I'm equally, if not more so at home eating late night Jack in the Box. It was my wife who insisted on us coming here to celebrate her birthday, because she wanted to enjoy a dining 'experience.'  Let me be clear about this: anyone who has actually eaten here and gives this place anything less than a full five stars is out of their freaking mind. Joel Robuchon is not just an amazing restaurant, it is literally the greatest culinary experience I have ever had in my life. And I have eaten at a number of fine establishments. And it's not even a close call.  At the time I made the reservations, I mentioned a severe nut allergy. More on that later. We are staying at Vdara and they sent a limo to pick us up. Tres chic. It makes one feel like they aren't just having dinner, but rather that they are now experiencing an event.  We drive through the back side of the MGM, to the Mansion, where our limo driver, A.J., drops us off and escorts us to the door. There we meet  Susie (who initially took my reservation), who greets us on cue and escorts us through the door, through a stunning courtyard, then through the mansion and finally out onto the casino floor and into the restaurant. From there, she guides us to our table. From start to finish, we never had to stop, it was one continuous motion from limo exit to being seated at our table.   If you've ever seen \"Goodfellas,\" there's a scene where Ray Liotta is introducing Debra Winger to life as his gf. The camera follows them through a back door, through a kitchen, and finally to a private table in front of a show at a club. We see the wonder on her face at what an amazing experience she's digesting. THAT is what you feel like. So effortlessly VIP it makes you question why you ever thought that you'd experienced VIP service before in your life.  A host of staff are at your service. A somolier, your server, a manager...at every step of the way, the server reminded me that he remembered our food allergies and gave warnings about specific dishes, or in the case of the desert cart, only brought out those desserts which we could eat.  I started with the mint pea cream soup, which was stellar, and my wife had the king crab app which was just beyond. Server comes by and asks if we want bread. Sure, why not? OMG, the guy's bringing out a tray with like 15 different types of bread and telling me about each one! Sweet. I love friendly, knowledgeable servers. Main courses were the foie gras for her and the salmon for me. Unreal as to both. For dessert, they surprised us with a birthday cake for my wife and then an assortment tray.   Bill comes...'hey, you're staying at Vdara, right? Would you like to just charge that to your room?\" Are you kidding me?? We're eating at a restaurant in the MGM Grand and you're offering me the option of charging my dinner to my room at Vdara?? Would I like to do that? Sure, I would, thanks for asking Romiro! And thank you for the gift bag that every diner gets when they leave.  And finally, Susie with the escort back to our waiting limo and then the ride back to our suite. Oh, did I forget that the chef even came out and thanked us for coming? And not like pretentious annoying chef, I mean like really friendly thank-you-so-much-for-eating-at-our-restaurant exuberant chef. He even posed for a pic, which might have been tacky on our part to ask him to do, but whatever, he was game and we wanted something to remember the experience by.  Now, let's be honest with ourselves for a moment. Our dinner ran a combined $450 when you add in the wine, the tips, the food, etc. That's not a cheap dinner, even if it does unfold over a leisurely 2 1/2 hours. And with a different wine selection, or an upgrade to the 16 course meal that they offer, a dinner for two here could easily run upwards of $1,000.   But, if your budget allows for such an extravagance, you will be hard pressed to ever have a better dining experience in your entire life. And I guess that's not a bad price to pay for such a memory.",

    "text": "We stayed at the MGM Grand's Skylofts and during our week stay they suggested we experience Joel Robuchon.  Our personal concierge made reservations and the restaurant highly recommended that as well.  The good people at MGM stated this limited seating restaurant served traditional French cuisine.  Since it was our first time dining there, we thought to delight in the sixteen course tasting menu along with a Dom 1990.  The event was bliss but very filling hehe.    In the beginning of the course there was a spoon sample here and a bite size morsel there so we thought this was going to be a tasteful journey.... then by the sixth course we felt that we may have bitten off more than we can definitely chew.  Each treat had its own unique taste and texture for our palates but we agreed that next time the six course tasting menu will suffice.    During the course, there were a few that were quite tasty.  Le Caviar (thin slices scallops w/lime zest, cauliflower cream, thin couscous and Oscetra caviar) was a surprise since I am not the caviar type.  Le Veau (sauteed veal chop w/natural jus and vegetable taglierinis flavored w/pesto) and La Coriandre (cilantro, gazpacho of red beet root w/olive oil) were also memorable.    I had to check the MGM web site because I couldn't remember the names but reading each description of the course helped for this review.  Before each course was served, the name and description was announced.  That service was informative since the majority of these goodies, visually, were foreign to me.  After each tastings, it was finally time for dessert!  I mainly sampled familiar pastries from their dessert cart.  They looked like what you'd expect in French sweets but more divine... what a way to have ended this journey.    The dress code stated as 'formal' attire but we dressed in contemporary casual wear and they didn't comment.  To be on the safe side, please follow their code request.  We failed to inquire on what to wear so after we visited the various shoppes, Joel was our next stop.",

    "text": "Perfect is the only way to describe this. I had a fairytale experience! To start off, we got picked up at the mandarin oriental hotel in a golden limo! Wow! We got dropped off at the \"secret back entrance\", escorted to the restaurant through a corridor of flowers and a water fountain. Once we were seated and eating, I can't even describe the flavors I tasted. Just out of this world incredible. That's all I can say.  ***Caution: spoiler!*** The desert cart and take-home candies are the best thing I have ever seen. I'm in love with this place. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!",

You won't find a better prepared team, and more tasteful menu, and a better ambiance in the world.  Serious diners only, bring your pocketbook, this is a World Class Dining experience.  I have done the tasting menu and have hosted a 14 course Krug dinner.  All of the experiences I have had are top notch.  The bar at Roubochon, just off the entrance to the left is the best kept secret for an amazing cocktail in the US.  Bon appetit!",

    "text": "Absolutely the finest dining experience I have ever had. We went with a group of six. Somehow, we worked it out to get a limo to pick us up and bring us in via the private Villa entrance at MGM Grand where the hostess met us. She walked us to the front door of Robuchon, and after dinner, she walked us back.   The food is absolutely indescribable, so I won't try. What struck me most was how friendly and accommodating the entire staff was. I took the hit and told our waiter that we're all somewhat new to this level of fine dining, and he took the time to explain all the ins and outs of the menu. He offered excellent suggestions, and the team of attentive servers made us feel welcome and cared for, from the refilling of wine glasses to providing short stools for the ladies' purses. Absolutely EVERY detail is accounted for!  The evening was an entire experience from pick up to dessert.  Unbelievable service, unbelievable food. Just a great experience altogether. I've read many complaints about the prices and the \"hidden\" charges of water or champaign or whatever. I experienced none of that. In fact, the three ladies in our party even left with complimentary gift bags with chocolate. There were ZERO surprises in cost, and I never felt cheated or scammed. Yes, it was very expensive, but hey, (1) it's Vegas; (2) it was a special ocassion; (3) it's not something I will repeat often.  If you can swing the cost--and it is a HIGH cost--definitely do it at least once!",
