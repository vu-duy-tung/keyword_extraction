We wanted to order food to go we asked them and they handed over the menu. Host told us to place the order with one of waiter now things start rolling down the hill everything seemed to go bad this guy looks very very very reluctant to take the order. We asked a dish he flatly refused we know it's not possible to have everything every time but there is always a way to put up things. We are not Asking anything for free we would pay without even bothering about the price. My message to the owners is Please do not let your staff treat your guests like this. Your restaurant is a awesome  but nothing is good if people are treated like this then no one would want to come .... As this is our 4th trip to Vegas but this is was the first time we thought of trying your place unfortunately we would be reluctant to suggest your place to anyone else hope you take this review in best of the spirits and this won't happen to anyone else ....

I had never really been into Indian food before, but not trying it and having other places, this place is pretty good. The service is good if you're a bunch of girls...haha. There are a couple of waiters that the girls lust over, so they definitely pay attention to us when we come in. The service has been delayed in that regard, but only delayed with us getting the check.    I've been there for the buffet and I've ordered individual dishes. I love every dish I've had with chicken in it. I don't usually like curry to much, but I love the curry dishes here. I usually get 7-10 on the spice level as well. There are also a lamb dish that is amazing, which is best spicy. I think most things are best spicy.   This is a great place to go on the strip for Indian food, and if you have a large group. They also have a back room that people seem to use quite frequently for large parties.",

The food was fine but came out a bit slow (not buffet style) and everything was mild for my tastes even though I asked for the food to be spicy. My parents loved it. I liked the tandooori sampler. The lamb vindaloo was tasty. The paneer tikka masala had a very mild creamy flavor. The garlic naan was what I expected: naan with garlic. Can't go wrong there. Other condiments were served at the table and were fine.  The service was very polite and I really appreciated it, however our bill was delivered to the table next to us. All the dishes were little pricy for me; it was $4 for just plain white rice. My family liked the food overall though, and the location is convenient.",

The service Fantastic. Everyone working here is attentive and helpful. So quick to clear old plates and fill drinks! Love that!   We've eaten at many Indian food buffets and have never had a selection of this size.  The atmosphere is calm, inviting, romantic and clean.  The food: Are you vegan? If so, this is the place for you. There are several vegan options. Like meat? The butter chicken is perfectly made and the Tandoori chicken is to die for!!!  Come to this place! You will be so happy you did if you Love Indian food.

Walking through this rundown strip mall and into a mysteriously empty building and up the escalator, I did not expect to find a beautiful atmosphere of Indian decor.

I was immediately greeted by a gentleman who gave me helpful suggestions on all of their vegan-friendly items. This made ordering very easy for me. While there were several options, I decided on the following:  Kali Dal (slow cooked Black Lentils and spices) <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F7Wv21z&s=d21dd954f6820bdb639daa0ecb1d557e6b55edaa759ceeedea37e2b5afc4c7ec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/7Wv21z</a> Veggie Samosas (about 5 or 6 pieces) <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F2wAdc9&s=d6024f85bbc405d343d626eafdff33a3de550ec89a660e39e3e983f4b1662351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/2wAdc9</a> Tandoori Roti - whole wheat flat bread Basmati Rice  One sad thing about take out is that the presentation is not as elegant. However, it smelled good, it tasted good, and I was happy. My friends were definitely peering over at my food. I even gave away one of my tasty Veggie Samosas. For the $33 that I paid, I had a full vegan meal plus enough leftovers for a second meal which tasted just as good two evenings later.",

Hence we deceived to get ala carte to which at least 3 people said that we should get their buffet. Moreover after our food arrived in 5 minutes, the Paneer Tikka masala we ordered was just warmed up from their buffet and consisted of only 5 pieces of paneer since we were 5 people. The portion size of Biryani was so small that it fed only 2 of 5 us!",

But this time the experience was extremely bad. I ordered Vegeterian Thali (Buddha Feast) that came with Dal Makhani, Kofta and Sag Paneer (Spinach and Cheese). As I was eating the people in the next booth tried to order Saag Paneer as an Entree and the waiter told them that it has gone bad so he cannot serve them. I called the  waiter and asked him if Sag Paneer was bad then why did he serve me. He did not have a clear answer and tried to wiggle out of the situation. Then I asked to speak with the manager and brought the same issue to his attention. The Manager (guy with beard) started yelling at me - if it was bad then why did I eat it. Shameful answer (blame the customer).   I asked him for the check, paid the bill and left. Not going there ever again. I am stressed right now and feeling I will get sick eating bad food. Do not want to get sick while traveling for work.  Update on 01/25/2017: I suffered from food poisioning for one week.",

Service by a certain server named Anand (tall guy, grey hair) was much below par. The only the only thing he did promptly was to take the initial order. For every thing else (water, soda, extra naan) we had to raise our hand in hope that this server would notice and come to the table.  We even had to wait long to get the check and the receipt. All this on a Tuesday night - not weekend.  When I tipped him apt to the service reveived (it was not zero. There was still some tip). This server totally lost his cool and started shouting abusive language in front of my kids.   Not coming back here. Not even in a decade. Would prefer McDonald's to this place.  Advice for the Anand (the server). You are in the wrong profession. Hospitality is not about expcting good returns for bad service. It is certainly not about shouting bad language to your customer for the tip you receive.",

The experience turned out to be just okay. The quality of food was not bad. In fact, the naan and Gulab jamun (dessert) were excellent, and  most of the other items, except Idlis and Sambhar were also okay (not great). Idlis were certainly stale by at least a day!   I have more problem with the variety aspect of the buffet. I have seen more variety in $10 buffets!! The number of vegetarian entrees especially was limited. How can any Indian buffet be complete without a single Paneer entree? And Really, Zucchini as an entree in an Indian buffet !? :-o Also, I would expect more starters than just pakodas and  at least, a complimentary chai in a $20 buffet!  (Chai was $2, and wasn't good!)  Next time, if you  are on the strip and you crave for Indian food, take the DEUCE to Indian Masala! You can thank me by a \"Useful\" vote here later! :-)",

I see that the right URL is provided, so let's make it easier for other people to find this Indian gem.  Since this was my first time out as a Las Vegas resident, I was extremely pleased to discover that Las Vegas does indeed have stellar Indian cuisine. I read the first review carefully and already knew it was considered excellent by Indian natives.  But when I arrived and saw that virtually everyone in the restaurant was Indian, I knew it was going to be superb and it was. My perennial favorite, Lamb Vindaloo, was as spicy as it should be. The lamb was tender, although I've tasted superior lamb, namely in Paris.  As a starter I ordered Onion Kulcha. The waiter brought out the nan accompanied by a plate of tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and pickled vegetables. I knew then and there that I would be in for a treat.  The rice was excellent although I prefer mine laced with peas and authentic cardamom seeds, but for most food lovers this is probably adventurous enough. ;)  In all, a great find in Las Vegas. Don't let the Hawaiian Marketplace surroundings fool you, this is truly outstanding Indian food and Las Vegas deserves it.",

    "text": "3.5 rounded up to 4...  My friend and I were really lucky to find this restaurant, since it was hidden in a deserted mall/plaza. But to the point - it was delicious!  We decided to share \"Ashoka's feast\", which consisted of a variety of dishes because it was a good deal (comes with rice, naan, dessert, multiple meat dishes, etc.)... it was almost True, but the portions were a tad too small for two people. We had to order extra naan in the end and used it to dip the leftovers with. Everything was pretty good, but I just wish the food was bit more spicier.   The servers were really friendly and helpful, too! I think this place really is the only Indian restaurant on the strip? Well, that's what they claim on their website... Overall, not bad... Price comes out to around ~$15/person... Personally, I think I've had better, but I guess I'm not too picky about my Indian food because they always taste so flavorful to me. I think if I were to come back here, I'd come for the lunch buffet, though.",

The ambiance is nice, but it's a little creepy to walk into the building as it's pretty much deserted but for the 1 tenant (Tamba).  The buffet sucked -- only 3 appetizers (one was a salad), a few vegetarian curries and rubbery naan that no one replenished in the 2 hrs we were there. The curries were not spiced and lacked any flavor, it was very bland and uninspired. One of the curries was an odd choice for a North Indian restaurant (squash...TF?).   Service was poor in that they didn't care to ask what we wanted to drink, took a long time to refill waters and were walking around like zombies (not looking at guests, no expressions, indifferent).",

We were informed that the restaurant was renovated internally about 2 years ago. Tampa has made some very nice and noticeable changes to its interior. Tamba could use some improvements to the exterior as well. It is deep set in an aging shopping center which prevents Tamba from completely standing out and getting noticed. The quality of the food and the service was excellent. Service included knowledgeable servers who wasted no time in informing us of the daily specials and the top selling dishes of the restaurant. We had the Pani Puri for an appetizer and it was delightfully flavorful. For dinner we had the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken. Both of these dishes were prepared to our taste buds' liking. The sauce on the Butter Chicken consisted of the right texture, color and flavor. The Chicken Tandoori lacked the artificial color (Thank You) which many Indian restaurants use to make it red however it tasted as chicken from a full flavored tandoor oven. It was tender and had the right combination of the herbs and spices. It was a delightful change at Tamba from ten years ago and we will visit again.",

They concluded that its a machine problem and order was not taken at all... That was strange.. I never faced such type of delays anywhere..

We walked from the MGM at about 9:00 which is a pretty weird scene. The mall is empty except for this restaurant.   The restaurant was about 3/3 full with more than 1/2 of the people eating there Indian or Pakistani.   We ordered on basmati rice, 2 naans, 1 began bharta and 1 matter paneer. ALL excellent, literally the best roast eggplant curry I have EVER had. They roast the eggplant in their Tandoori oven which adds a smoky flavor. The texture and heat were just right.  Paneer was perfectly made.  The portions are more than twice the size of what I normally get here in San Francisco/Bay Area.  Pricing a bit higher, but it is Vegas and 10-12.00 a dish is not unreasonable.   Waiter and hostess and bus staff were all very nice and efficient.",

    "text": "Almost everyone in Vegas claims to have a special deal for you.  Usually, it's associated with trying to make more from you off something else (once they get you in), or just offering you something at a discount because it was way overpriced to begin with.  Then there are those deals that are so low because it's crappy food (like many of the prime rib specials.) Well, Tamba doesn't fit into any of those categories, but they have a genuine deal: a $12.95 lunch buffet!  And it's not the type of buffet that you're accustomed to running away from.  There are a variety of reasons I stay away from buffets these days, but Indian buffets tend to be an exception. Quality food, and wait for it...fresh food. Shocker!  I had salad with mint chutney, potatoes, rice, marsala, chicken tandoori, and a few other things I can't all remember.  Most of the items contain a description above it, but when I was struggling, one of the employees noticed and gave me a suggestion in a kind matter.  He didn't make me feel dumb at all for not knowing what some things were.  It's a pretty nice restaurant too, quite large and relaxing ambience, really dim.  It's nice to feel relaxed at a buffet, rather then rushing through buffet lines or worrying that the person in front of you is gonna get it before you.  There was none of that here (at least when I went).  I'm surprised it wasn't more crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but I'm not going to complain.  The waiter filled my drinks up frequently and was really polite.  When I want a quality affordable large meal in Vegas, I know where I'll be having lunch.",

It's easy to sip through the straw and afterwards it doesn't feel like you ate a liquid dessert.  3 stars: We shared the Ashoka's Feast which was good but not great. In my opinion, the spices were a bit muted. I like indian food that is tantalizing and I love it when I taste new combination of spices. But, Ashoka's Feast didn't do that for me. I'd definitely come back and try other entrees.  Overall 3.5 stars: This spot is definitely a good eatery if you're in Vegas and on a budget. The service is great and the ambience is warm and soothing. As for it's  location, it is in the middle of strip so it's not too hard to get there. Just walk over, break a little sweat, and stuff your face with some good food!",

    "text": "As an Indian (from Fiji) who eats Indian food daily, I think I can bring to light that this place is not average. It is slightly below average. For one, the prices are ridiculous. I understand this is Vegas, but who doesn't include naan or rice with their entrees? This was definitely a first for me.   I was asked if I wanted my food mild or spicy, but my wife wasn't. When she got her meal (Yellow Dal) it was very spicy and not to her liking. She barely ate any of her food. She didn't return the food either because she was already so unsatisfied with the service she didn't feel the need to wait again. I'll give them credit for my Butter Chicken meal for being slightly above average and the spice (heat) level to be of my liking.   Decor is nice, except for the random book shelf wall diving the kitchen from the dining. Atmosphere is above average.  Service was bad, to put it simply. Our actual waiter only came to the table when we got there, when we ordered, and when we got the check. Other waiters helped us in between. Also, our waiter waited over 15 minutes to bring us our check. He was wandering around and had clearly seen us just sitting there waiting. I'm not a bad customer or just rude, but I couldn't stop thinking about just walking out if this place and not give them any of my hard-earned money.   Overall, I won't ever be coming back here. I'll wait to go back home and get my Indian food instead of wasting time and money here. I'm giving it two stars simply because this place gave me a chance to eat something that reminded me of home.",

The server was a bit confused because I ordered a Sprite and she did not bring it until 15 minutes later. I thought you just pour Sprite in the glass it does not need to be cooked. I proceeded to the buffet section but most items were already out. Indian food has lots of variety and biryani is always included in most buffet if not lamb at least chicken. They had plain rice and other curries. The sweet selection were only 2 choices. You can add kheer, gulab jamun, and maybe carrot halwa? Anyway the items were limited I did not enjoy the buffet that much. I have been to other Indian buffets out of Las Vegas and they do have better selection that Tamba had.",

I was excited to eat here because there were so many people in the restaurant.  It has to be a good restaurant.  Once we were seated a young lady brought our menus to us and water.  She said our waiter would be right back.  No one came.  She came back to the table to take our order.  We gave here the order and waited patiently.  And we waited more.  Another waiter came over and asked us if we placed our order.  I told his yes we placed the order with the young women.  He started to shake his head and I knew something went wrong.  He told us the reason he came over is because the restaurant is closing and he saw our table was seated but no food was ordered in the system for the table.  He told us to give him the oder and he would put a rush on it.  We gave him the order and they did rush the order.  We did not get one of the items on our order, so we told him the Pani Puri is missing.  He went back into the kitchen and told us that they are out of Pani Puri.  The food was ok.  I am not sure if the food was just ok because they had to rush it.  There was no apology from the waiter or the manager.  Even if they are better then this I will not be going back.",

Me and my girlfriend were sitting in the waiting area for 10min to be seated then another couple came after we have already waited for 10min and the host got them seats and when I asked the host that what's going on his reply was(in a VERY rude tone): \"Wait outside i will be with you soon\". Then he finally called us in and there was no apology whatsoever but we were hungry so I was like never mind. He said we have a buffet going on and you can help yourself, so we did. Now when got to the buffet station something STINKED really bad, I didn't realize it was the food that was stinking, I thought it must be something they used in the mop or other but then we took the food back to our table and I ate one bite of the naan with alloo mattar and I figured right away what was stinking. I told my girlfriend to not eat the food because we don't want to get sick. I asked the same rude guy to get me our check because whatever they do, even if they are serving old food, I made the call to go to this restaurant because we got lured in by the decorations outside the business so I still want to pay them, regardless of how much it is. They guy asked me what happened I told him that the food stinks, I ate a bite and I know you're serving old food and you know that too but for now, just get me my check so that we can clear our dues and still not get sick. He said ohh in that case you leave the food and just go, I asked him are you sure? He said yes and I am sorry. We walked away, just because he didn't charge us and apologized for serving old food and acknowledging it I am giving 2 stars. If you consume old food, especially old Indian food which is mostly curry based it will make you sick in a giffy and that's not right. I even checked in while I was there and even took a photo.

The vegetarian version of the feast started with samosas followed by Saag Paneer, Dal and a korma - not sure of the name along with really good naan.    The meat version started with an awesome tandoori chicken followed by Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Masala and dal.     All really good!  Service was good.

Very authentic, polite and attentetive staff, nice cozy environment. Insanely reasonable for all you can eat for two..came out to be under $30 with the 10% check in discount. This place is a gem. Sweet rice and mini samosas are amazing, they bring fresh naan to your table even when you eat at the buffet. We will absolutely return next we're in Vegas!",

Luckily nothing happened to him , but we literally had to run and gave him medicines before anyrging happen to him. Owner even though understood our language, never came to our table once. 25% discount doesn't solve the problem.  (Ideally, they should have made whole order free, but   I am not going to argue for that).   Also, they add lots of food color especially in paneer curry . Please be aware of that..!! My wife also had allergies due to that afterwards :( :(.  Giving 1 star because service wasn't too bad. Servers and Manager was not as good as thry should have been in mistake they made, but that s fine.  I dont know , if they take this seriously or not, but from now onwards, anytime I am in Vegas, this restaurant will be my last option..!!",

    "text": "I visited this place few times in past several years and the food was always pretty decent. However, last year i noticed that they had started serving tourist buses which hoard the place like bees to honeycomb. Last year I ignored it but this year when we visited the place again it turned out to be a big mistake. The server asked us to wait outside while they kept accepting 3-4 tour buses(about 100-150 ppl) one after other in front of us. In addition, they asked us to pay upfront for the buffet which is something I have never experienced at any decent restaurant.  We waited for 20 mins watching hoard of Indian tourists going in and out of the place. We asked the server if we can go in and check the spread of buffet but we couldnt even get a sneak peek of the spread because the place was full of overflowing tourists like washroom of a football stadium. We left place and returned the next day for lunch. It was the same story all over again. I am guessing the management only cares about making money and not providing any service.   I am sad this place was so good before. I dont think I or any of my friends are going to visit this place again.",

We were in the mood for Indian and with the help of the Yelp app, found this place and quickly made a reservation through opentable. The reservation wasn't really necessary since upon arrival, there were plenty of tables available.   We were seated and it took much longer than necessary for any of the servers to acknowledge us and provide menus, drinks, etc. I think this was because there was a large party in the back room which occupied their time. This party also had a buffet setup that contained some of the most unique and appetizing Indian food I had ever seen. Unofortunately it was not open to people outside of their party. Shucks!  The food was decent and the price was ok. I was glad that we had the opportunity to not eat in another casino buffet or chain restaurant. If you like Indian, check this place out.",

Quality  of food  and quantity of food is  below average. Our Naans were  not evenly cooked properly.  It was a disappointment for the money we spent. They must improve or they will go under.   Next day, we ate dinner Buffett  in Aria  on the strip across from Tamba.  They have Indian Tabdoori food in buffet menu and many others high quality items such as crab,  sea food, deserts, Asian,  American and Italian food.  For what we spent  in Tamba, we  got many times  the value and top service that of course one can expect from a five  star hotel.  I will like to patronize  Indian food but I will recommend to explore other choices that offer Indian food and Tandoor dishes such as served in Aria hotel and casino.",

I have to say, the items were in Indian so I had no idea about a few items that I was eating but since I'm adventurous like that, I put a teeny bit of whatever I didn't know and then decided if I wanted seconds. Certain items were a tad spicy but not enough to ruin your meal if you're sensitive to heat. The Tandoori Chicken, which always tends to be dry, was super juicy, the Curry Chicken was fragrant and addicting. The Rice was soft and fluffy and they give u a basket of Naan for your table. I may have been the only Spanish person here, lol, everyone else was Indian, I love that, very telling AND promising. The price is right, $14 for a very clean, well maintained, hot meal. If you want a hearty, savory meal this would be the place to go. Vegas wants to attack your pocket and serve u junk, but this place is the real deal. I would DEFINITELY go back.",

    "text": "I rarely write negative reviews. But, experience at Tamba has been so different that I had to. 6 of us went for lunch buffet on the 30th December 2015 afternoon. We were happy to find an Indian place on the strip! The ambience was good, location was great and the food tasted ok as well! Upma was very tasty. Idly was very dry - probably because we went around 2:00 pm which was too late for the food to be fresh.  My main complaint is,the minute we completed our lunch all of us felt extremely drowsy and sleepy. All of us were not up until late evening. We were surprised that all 6 of us felt the same way! Neither we were sleep deprived nor extremely tired to doze off after lunch.  On sharing this with our friends, we came to know that 12 of our friends had lunch buffet in Tamba sometime in September 2015. Most of them had an upset stomach.   All other restaurants had a long wait time because of which we chose to go to an Indian place. Had we chosen a different place, we might explored the strip that afternoon instead of warming our beds.   Hope this is not happening to anyone else!",

Then, the place started filling up. Next reason: I was the sole Anglo there, everyone else seemed to be from the sub-continent or at least know their way around a tandoor. The long buffet had a variety of great dishes, veggie and carnivore. It could have been sliced up more for my taste, but that's why we hit the chutneys. It's a little pricey since I don't wallow away from the trough overstuffed and miserable but I'll be back. Great place. Look inside the crazy Hawaiian-themed outdoor mall/whatever it is.

Having lived in India as foodies for 20 yrs i can say that this is undoubtedly the BEST high-end Indian restaurant in the city. The food isn't loaded with spice... and the ingredients are fresh and aromatic. Been here couple of times whenever I visited Las Vegas.  To begin, this is a fine dining experience & the ambiance is good.  Brilliant food, brilliant service and a wonderful atmosphere! The waiters were very friendly. The atmosphere is very calm, perfect for a dinner after sunset. The food is a perfect replica of authentic indian food, and the most real indian food you'll find in Las Vegas possibly in even The whole west coast. The menu is vast and full of variety. Can be a perfect setting for a romantic or group dining. For all veg/ Non-Veg eaters, I recommend you should try their signature dish because you will be blown away, trust me. What else can you ask for. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in town.  A special note to Mr. Rishi Kappor ( GM of Tamba )  \" It was a tremendous experience dining at your restaurant. Thank you so much for your outstanding professionalism and warm hospitality shown to us. The service and food quality was excellent, a credit to you all. Thank you for a most enjoyable evening.....God willing I will return some day soon, rest assured that your business cards will be passed along, so thanks again and a hearty CHEERS!! \"",

The best part was the garlic naans they were moist and perfectly cooked . If you are in Vegas and craving some Indian authentic food this is a must place to come . I was staying in MGM grand and walked everyday there to eat and it was all worth it .",

There was no paneer dish, they had tofu instead of that. Other choices were baigan (eggplant), tasteless kali dal without salt, and stale idlies stinking the whole food area, somebody told about it to the owner. In non-veg only 2 main course options, very bad deserts mango custard (served as a yellow color with water and sugar) Being a buffet priced for $16, with limited choices (2 appettizer, 3 veg main course dishes, 2 non veg dishes and 2 deserts). Not at all worth it. Not coming back at all. You have to pay first before starting the food you like it or not",

Most people get excited about Vegas because of the debauchery they are about to partake in.....yes, yes, that's all good and well done, but aside from my roulette high, TAMBA is why I sing Viva Las Vegas!  Go for the lunch buffet and you will see what I mean--it's a vegetarian dream!  there's like 10 veggie items on the huge buffet and the naan is soooooooo good!  I will warn you, it gets crazy sometimes on weekends, line out the door, raita and chutney slinging to and fro, elbowing people out of the way for the last scoop of halva, etc.  BUT, it's worth the madness.  P.S. Handy-dandy tip: when you are in your hotel room--look for the coupon that gives you 10% off the buffet, I randomly came across this when I flipped through the Vegas magazine last time I was at Caesar's Palace soaking in the tub.  Also, if you like even more heat, they will hook you up with some extra hot sauce, just ask.",

There is a lot behind Mcdoanld's...there is a booth with a parking attendant...says $5.  We told them we had a dinner reservation at Tamba and he let us right in.  No $5 necessary.  We tried the cheese appetizer served with spicy mint sauce, tamarind sauce and crackers.  It was really good!  We had lamb korma, chicken tikka masala, eggplant, 2 types of naan, and basmati rice.  The sauces on the chicken and lamb were excellent but the meat was dry in both.  The eggplant was out of this world.  Everything had great flavor.    I would definitely go back and I'm recommending it to all.    We spent $100 for 4 with all the aforementioned and 2 large beers.",

I admit there are some things I've come to expect from an Indian buffet, like that the naan should probably be freshly brought out to the table, rather than wasting away en masse under a hot light. The core of the meal, the proteins, should also not be mystery meat bobbing in a thin gruel of oil and colored sauce. The most edible thing was probably the goat curry, and only because I love me some lamb/goat. There were little signs to help you navigate the curries (as we discovered later), but they misidentified stuff and were hard to read. The place looks nicer than it tastes, fo sho.",

    "text": "Indian food for two?  Walking upstairs at the Hawaiian marketplace, you'll be surprised to see this dimly lit restaurant and its ample seating area.  They offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la carte.  It's hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when it's just you and the BF.  But Tamba offers a couple of 'feasts' to help satisfy that curiosity!  For $25, the BF got the Ashoka's Feast which comes with:  * Tandoori Chicken \"Spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt sauce.\" - It came with two drumsticks and two breasts, a decent amount to start his meal.  There were three dipping sauces - the mint one, a chutney of some sort, and a dark purplish one.  I'm not a particular big fan of tandoori, but the BF ate three pieces of it.  * Lamb Curry \"Cubes of lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red chilies, and pickling spices.\" - It tasted a bit gamey for me, but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce.  * Chicken Tikka Masala \"Chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce.\" - The chicken was white meat, and pretty flavorless.  But the curry sauce was SO good!  I wish I had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  Next time I'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!  * Kali Dal \"Slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices.\" The BF thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito, as in skip the black beans, refried beans, or pinto, and add some black lentils instead.  Pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too.  * Rice - A generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration.  Needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer.  * Nan \"White flour tandoori bread\" - A must when eating Indian food.  My preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries, especially those that come with tikka masalas!   * Raita - Condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip.  Served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the BF was doing it.  I can pass on this.    * Daily Dessert - Two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey.  Oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty Indian dinner.  I ordered up the Buddha's Feast for $21 and this is what I got:   * Vegetable Samosa \"Crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas.\" - The order came with two samosas, and two dipping sauces.  The BF was pretty impressed by these, and I'm lucky that I had two to share!  * Malai Kofta \"Chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce.\" - It came with one chunk of cheese only, which I couldn't even tell was cheese! I thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something.  The sauce was okay, and good for dipping.   * Saag Paneer \"Spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices.\" - It came with one piece of cottage cheese, and I think it lacked flavor.  The BF said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite Indian dishes.  * Kali Dal  * Rice  * Nan  * Raita  * Daily Dessert  The feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and it's a decent amount of food.  You definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much food.  The BF also ordered a Mango Lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking.  I thought it tasted fine, but was more watery than what I'm used to.  Service was good - our water glasses were filled without asking.  The only complaint was that our main courses came out too quickly after our appetizers.  We had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platters.  There's also a back room available for private parties with a more family style seating.  Sidenote: You can get a 50% off coupon/entree at the Tix4Less booth downstairs! Or a 10% coupon from their website.  (Check out the pics of our eating in the business profile!)",

Over the last 6 months, I started seeing that some staff changed, more importantly, attitude and arrogance has snuck in.   Last night's experience made sure that I will never visit this place again and would never recommend Tamba to any visitors to Las Vegas. Main issues that they have:  1) Extremely arrogant staff that leads to Horrible service and also wrong dishes being served. 2) Very poor quality of food. One out of 3 dishes we ordered had double salt in it!! When questioned about these, their answer is: Sometimes these things happen.  Long story short, AVOID this place if you want to be treated well for the price you pay!! Not a wallet friendly place....Nickel and dime you for everything....",

It is always a good thing when you see natives having a meal at their restaurant :) Most of the meat dishes were spicy but tasty. Like their selections of dishes (salad, fried veggie, flat bread, some curry sauces, lamb/goat curry, chicken) Good price too. Look for their coupon at the vegas guidebook-ask your hotel",

    "text": "I read the reviews of this place before coming and found it interesting that there was such a spread of opinions.  My experience with yelp reviews has been that they tend to clump together around a mutually-agreed upon rating but this one had people who loved it and people who hated it.  My fellow diner and I agreed that 3.5 stars is just about the correct rating though.  Impressions: The place is nicely decorated with low light and soft music.  It is upstairs in a a grim looking food court in the back of a low-rent outdoor shopping center.  It has a nice ambiance once inside though.  We went for the lunch buffet.    Pros: Very friendly and attentive staff.  My water glass never reached the half-way empty mark.   Plenty of vegetarian selections in the buffet The chicken tikka masala and a paneer curry (I missed the name) were both very good  Cons: the daal was overly salty Some dishes were just okay and not spectacular  Overall we had a nice lunch here but I've had better Indian buffets in the Bay Area.  In the midst of a sea of burgers and undercooked pizza slices however this is a welcomed change.",

Few Americans I spoke to dreamed of eating a curry (and it's tough to find in supermarkets), but I need not have worried.  Vegas has a great array of Indian food available of varying quality. I have tried it all and the one place the wife and I keep coming back to is Tamba.  Oddly situated at the back of the abandoned hulk that is The Hawaiian Marketplace Foodcourt, Tamba is in my opinion the best food to be had anywhere on The Strip.  Everything is spiced to perfection and there's a great array both for meat eaters and vegetarians.  The lunch buffet is sensational value.  Confused at the people here saying the service is bad/rude. I can barely take a sip of my water before a polite (to the point of humble) waiter is rushing to top me up!",

You can only access the parking lot from the northbound Las Vegas Blvd.  There is a little parking lot behind mcdonalds.  The restaurant is located upstairs in a little strip mall or whatever  it is.  There is an escalator to get up there.  We sat down on a monday night - not busy, but i dont care.  The waiter took forever to take our order.  I ordered the Meat Thali.  The food was bland and not tasty.  It was better than Gandhi Indian restaurant for sure, but still sucked.  We came here specifically because another yelp review said that the naan melted in your mouth.  I call BS.  No way.  The prices were expensive 15-18 dollars a plate.   They gave us onions and indian pickle without asking which was nice.  Anyway Bottom line is that I will keep looking for that elusive good indian restaurant in Las Vegas",

We ordered:  -Chicken Tikka: delicious cubes of flavorful chicken served with sides of mint as well as tamarind sauces.  -Tandoori Chicken: delicious preperation, i only wish the cuts of chicken were meatier.  -Chicken Tikka Masala: my favorite dish. Full of flavor and soft tender chicken pieces. The sauce base is perfect for dipping your naan into.  -Chicken Vindaloo: the spice level was perfect. it was spicy enough for those who are adventurous, but it wasn't so spicy that is took away from the wonderful flavor.  -Yellow fried rice: great flavor, perfect accompaniment to the tandoori chicken.  -Naan: plain butter and garlic : both were excellent. flaky with a soft fluffy center.  -Drinks: Bombay 7, Sapporo beer, Strawberry daiquiri    The service was fantastic both from the waiter and the bussers. The ambiance was excellent and the decor and dishes they used to serve the food were very modern. I would not hesitate to take a date here.",

Our first dinner there was on Sunday night - we fell in love with the place. The waiters were friendly and helpful. We were given a second dessert for free because we were told we HAD TO try that one too. We were so happy that we did. My first visit to Tamba - food, service, perks - gets 5 STARS.  We went back to Tamba a few days later with a friend. The food was still good, but seemed saltier than Sunday. We had ordered different dishes so not sure if the saltiness was just due to our order. We still enjoyed the food and the service was good, but a little off on the timing. Barely touched appetizer before main course came out. One of the servers seemed annoyed by the use of the coupon, but otherwise, it was still good. Second visit: 3 STARS.",

In a Buffett it is advisable to have breads served fresh on the table but they had it in the bar..cold and old. Any good - no! They are just making money because of their location.",

The meal came out to $55 with wine!  Wine: Bonny Doon Riesling. Something about a sweet white wine pairs nicely with spicy, rich Indian food. This retails for $11 and paid $26 at the restaurant. Not too bad of a mark-up I guess.   Entrees: Tandoori chicken--yum yum. Very generous portion.  Prawn Makhni--rich buttery cream sauce. On the spicy side.  Chicken Tikka Masala -- another rich flavorful curry.  3 dishes with rice and garlic nan--the 3 of us were completely stuffed.",

    "text": "Shockingly good! I am most grateful to my fellow Yelpers for drawing our attention to this establishment. We never would have ventured into the Hawaiian Marketplace for food--never. After reading the reviews and finding a coupon in the Vegas 24/7 booklet, we went.  It was exactly as stated, totally deserted. We wondered whether it was open when we arrived at about 8:30. By the time we left, it filled to overflowing with mostly Indian clientele (which is telling). I think the dinner buffet began around 9 PM.   My husband and I are big fans of Indian, but we always find it hard to get really good and not just mediocre Indian cuisine. There's lots of mediocrity out there in terms of Indian. Tamba was really really tasty. We tried two new dishes which we enjoyed.   The first was Panipuri, an Indian street food, which involves a hollow shell made of Indian crispy bread which you fill with a green spicy sauce which is supplied separately. Thanks to our server who told us how to eat it. It's fun. Like a shot of mild spice.   The other dish we had was the dessert which came with the Ashoka's feast. It was made of dried carrot and nuts. Now, I have this weird thing against cooked carrots. They make me gag, but I love raw carrot. It's strange. So anyhow, I was not aware of what this dish, Gajar Halva, was made out of. I asked the waiter. It tasted nothing like carrot. It has this amazing texture and sweetness. I highly recommend it. Like most extra-American dishes, I find that you should eat it without knowing what it is. I think many Americans have preconceived notions of what things should taste like and their texture so knowing what you're eating is more apt to gross you out than allow you to experience it.   Oh yea, while the food was excellent here and the service, the Ashoka's feast is not really enough food for two people. We ordered the pani puri as an appetizer with this in mind and even though I wasn't starving, it was barely enough food. It was all very tasty, but I wish we had ordered a bit more food (especially now as I write this really wishing I was in Vegas eating some Tamba).  I also did not find Tamba to be generic in any way, it was decorated nicely and was lit well, somewhat romantically, and quiet.",

Waiters are attentive, but not overly so (which I hate).  The buffet choices are excellent and all food is fresh and warm and tasty!

Tip: don't forget to check in on Yelp for 10% off!  The friends I came to Vegas with all love Indian food, so we decided to grab an Indian meal for our last dinner in Vegas. The four of us arrived Sunday night around 7:30 pm and the restaurant was about half full, so we were able to get seated immediately. Most of the other patrons were Indian which seemed promising for the food.  The restaurant is in a super weird location on the second floor of what appeared to be a deserted mall with not much else inside. We were staying near the Cosmo and it was maybe a 10-15 minute walk from there, so at least it's pretty close to the heart of the strip.  We ordered a couple of things to share:  Samosa chaat ($8) - this dish is like a deconstructed samosa with some additional toppings served with yogurt and a sweet tamarind sauce. it was pretty good here  Butter chicken ($14) - I enjoyed the creamy sauce this was served in  Paneer tikka masala ($14) - I'm not a big fan of paneer (I think of it as Indian cheese) but I liked the tikka masala it came in, which honestly didn't taste that different from the curry sauce used for the butter chicken  Yellow dal ($13) - essentially lentil soup, this dish was my favorite out of the three since I love dal  We also ordered some rice, naan, and roti to eat with the curries as well.  Service was slightly on the slower side as we had trouble finding our server to flag him down, but we weren't in a rush so that was fine. Ended up paying around $20 pp.",

    "text": "Decided to go here for lunch with my brother because we were craving for some Indian food and we were essentially stuck on the Strip so this was the perfect place to go to!   This place is a bit different since you have to pay upfront before going into the buffet. It is also easy to miss because it is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace Plaza. You have to go into the main building next to the Chili's and just ignore the rundown shops on the first floor as you ascend to the second level where this restaurant is located.    They have a good selection of food like naan, butter chicken, basmati rice, tandoori chicken, and some other items. The naan is in the buffet so you can grab as much as you want when you want it! The only downer is that it is plain naan instead of garlic, but it still tastes fine since you can just eat it with the curry for flavor.   I'd recommend checking this place out if you like Indian food and want a change of pace when it comes to eating on the strip. The lunch price with the Yelp discount was about $14-15/ person which isn't too bad considering the food and location. Also, I saw a bunch of Indian people when we walked in so that must mean this place is good! The staff is also very attentive as they refill your drink and take away your plates in a timely manner.",

There were lots of \"ethnic\" types which is always a good sign. The chicken curry, tandoori chicken and spiced cauliflower and potatoes were excellent. The naan was good and the dhaal and sambhar were actually not good. So there you have it. Also there was no drink included with the meal for $12.99 which if fine. But what I found quite annoying was that you had to prepay and then if you wanted anything other than water, pay again. This did not make me happy.  Exc -Curry, Tandoori Chicken, spiced veggies. Good - Decor Ave - Food Poor - Paying policy   WOULD I GO BACK? Probably not. I think I would try another Indian restaurant first.",

Two of us are Indian food junkies and knew we'd need a fix while there. Great choice in picking Tamba!  We had made reservations for Thursday night at 7, but didn't need them b/c the place was dead when we got there.  It picked up as the night went on, but I think the location (hidden in a building behind the Hawaiian market) makes it a tough find.  We both ordered entrees instead of the buffet.  She ordered a chicken curry and I ordered the eggplant dish.  Both oh-so yum with excellent spice and seasoning.  We also got rice and naan to split, and a $30 bottle of wine.  Our total damage?  About $60.  Cheap for Vegas, huh? Decor was nicer than the usual Indian restaurant, dim lighting, and I liked the way the restrooms were decorated.  No loud Bollywood music videos playing here.  And it's always a good sign when most of the customers are Indian families! Our cheapest and BEST meal of the trip.",

I tried the Murg Biryani, which was a very flavorable chicken & rice dish with nuts and raisins! My favorite part would have to be the raisins...it gave the dish a very surprising sweetness to it!

    "text": "I think where the rating is right now at 3 1/2 is probably right. I also agree with a lot of other yelpers about getting the best indian buffet for your money. First, I dont expect to be amazed by a buffet, and second, i definitely dont expect to be amazed by a buffet that is so cheap (compared to other buffets on the strip). You get a good variety of indian food (mostly vegetarian) and its around $13. What is the funniest thing about this place is where it is located. It is inside a, what seems to be an abandoned food court type building, and is the only that has been running ever since I first came here 4 years ago. Seriously, I have never seen any other store in this food court open.  I think if you dont mind eating a little unhealthy indian food that tastes decent you should check this place out. I have had their fresh food here once, and honestly this is one place where their fresh food tastes slightly better than their buffet. Usually, the restaurant's fresh food tastes way better than their buffet, but I guess their food quality doesnt change much between ordering off the menu or the buffet.",

A pricey $18 per person for a vegetarian buffet !! Most of the vegetables were creamy and oily - Ykes. None of the buffet items were labeled so I am guessing here. 1. Paneer dish- was just full of cream 2. The basic item like plane rice was over cooked and broken like some cheap quality rice - did not taste nor have the aroma of \"basmati rice\" 3. THe \"naan\" was cold, soggy and stacked up. We expected naan to be served hot at the table like any good indian resturant. 4.\"daahi vada\" was hard as rocks 5.  aloo bellpepper was full of oil  6. palak paneer - There wad not paneer in the \"Palak paneer\" 7. The desert-1 - gulab jamun\" was too hard and too sweet. 8.dessert-2 - fruit salad - not fresh fruital all from a can and tasteless. To top it off when the workers tried to pour a new batch of \" fruit salad\" they Trued pouring it in from a large container and inevitable it went all over his hand (no gloves) Wonder how kosher is the kitchen.  THis is when I had enough for this place.  Think twice before eating here.",

    "text": "Located in the Hawaiian Market, this is a hidden gem that many may over look. At first I was a little hesitant to try Indian food, but what better way to try it than with my Indian BF and his entourage of cousins, aunties, uncles and parents? We came here one Saturday evening for dinner and I fell in love with the setting. It's nothing like restaurants you see on the strip. It had a buffet, large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in India itself (or so I imagined). Being with the crowd I was with, it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes. You can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so. The vegetarian dishes were great. We started off with dishes like the Kurkari Bhindi- okra with brown onions and had chicken tikka for our entree.  The Naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over. I really enjoyed the dining experience and I think that I owe my love for Indian food to this restaurant.  This is a great for a first timer!!!",

They know most of the people visit here are outsiders who visit to see Las Vegas and they won;t  care of the food. They know people will anyway since there are no indian restaurant on the strip. My only advice for people who are looking for indian restaurant is please go out of strip and you can find few. The indian oven restaurant is good to eat on East Sahara Avenue, but that is also not great. My wife has food poisoing after coming back from Las Vegas. These are my 2 cents about this restaurant.",

Plenty of choice, including salad-y stuff, entrees, desserts, and plenty to satisfy either vegetarians or meat-eaters in your party.  It was all very good, especially the vegetable curry I tried.  The staff is helpful, the dining room is nice.  The only thing that would have improved the experience for me would be 1. being hungrier and 2. labels on the buffet choices (the staff were happy to answer our questions about any of the food, however).  #2 is a perennial complaint I have with Indian buffets... I like Indian food immensely and would like to learn more about it so I can remember what I especially like.  But all of the Indian places I frequent are label-less, so except for stuff that's easy to identify like curry, I am left describing things as \"that green goopy thing\" and \"that orange goopy thing\" and \"that other thing with the lamb\".",

I had always been hesitant to try it because the curry smelled so strong and that line from Anchorman always made me cringe (\"It smells like a baby's diaper full of Indian food\")....WAS I A RA-TARD!  My friends invited my man and I to a birthday gathering for a co-worker and were raving about this place. The owners have come to visit us at my work on several occasions so I thought I could at least go and see what it was all about. I knew it was going to be good because it was the only business left in the building (its located inside the Hawaiian Marketplace building by Polo Towers) and there were a ton of Indian people there (always a good sign).Alex was our server. He was very friendly and we left our dinner in his hands....what a smart decision. He brought out an AMAZING prix fixe menu I think of his own creation (nice touch). Now I will do my best to at least describe my favorites:  1) Little fried dough balls with peas and potatoes inside...served with a mint cilantro and some sort of sweet/spicy glaze (tandoori sauce?) 2) Chicken tandoori....great flavor. Sweet/spicy and BBQ'd to perfection 3) Lollipop lamb chops with some sort of glaze with a kick (great with the mint cilantro and sweet/spicy sauce mixed together). 4) Chicken Tikka Masala....HOLY COW! You must get this dish. The curry is mild, its creamy and a little bit of heaven in a dish.  5) Garlic nan....garlic flat bread which was perfect for dipping in the Chicken Tikka Masala.  I was so happy when we left. My man and I actually went back the following evening because I was craving it again. Just as good the second time and we actually got Alex as our server again...he remembered us from the night before (another nice touch). Will be back again soon.",

We walked in and were seated, immediately (of course there were only 8 other people in the restaurant).  The aroma of spices were all around and our appetites were ready to get down.  We were greeted by a gorgeous Morrocan man.  (Yay!  What a way to get the night started.)  And soon after a Philipino hottie joined in.  Two servers + four ladies = an exciting dining experience.  Hakim hooked us up with suggestions on food and drinks (that would be alcohol beverages).  What a delight!  Everything was good...except how distracted our 2 servers would get.  Something went wrong with the bill...for them.  I don't even remember the details.  I just remember having a great time.  I've been back several times now with my lady friends.  We always have a good time and good eats at this place.  If you like Indian food and you're looking for a place on the strip, this is it.  If you're looking for a place to hit up before a night out, this is it.  If you're looking for an Indian buffet, this is it.  (Yes, they do a lunch buffet and the price is low.)   Nummy nummy in our tummy tummies.",

All people in the group were happy with the food.  Things were made well and tasty.  Service was decent.  The wobbly table was annoying.  Only minor thing was the heat level. We all asked for HOT, the server said Indian hot?  We all said YES... and it was unanimous that it came more a medium.  That didnt ruin anything.  Just a preference.  There was a buffet for a \"private\" party that all filed in while we were eating. So towards the end of our meal it was quite busy.  This is a place I would go again. The prices were reasonable, the food was really good, portioned well, good variety and there were no major issues during our visit.  We all found it enjoyable.",

Atmosphere was depressing. Tamba is in an indoor \"mall\", with ZERO other businesses.   You pay before you eat which is fine if you have cash for tip. Several reviews said non alcoholic drinks are included, that wasn't the case on Sunday when we visited. We weren't asked if we wanted drinks until we were seated, since we already paid, we decided to stick with water. Lost revenue on their part.  Overall, it was ok. My husband and I prefer Namaste and Mt. Everest.   As Vegas locals, we will probably not return to Tamba as the only draw is that we live across the street from it.",

Instead, this restaurant is located inside a mostly vacant building, and the food they serve is very bland.  The good: - great selection of vegetarian dishes - the Sambar was the best item on the buffet - atmosphere in the restaurant was good  The bad: - Food was very bland, except for a couple of items that were good - there were only 3 meat dishes and they were all chicken - service was ok, no one ever came by to take my drink order - fairly expensive for a lunch buffet ( $15 a person without a drink)  This place was okay, but there are better places to go for dinner than here.  But if you are craving indian food, then this is basically the only choice you have along the strip.",

Unlike most Indian restaurants in Vegas, the cooks at Tamba don't focus on a bland tourist palate.  And as a result, they don't produce spice-less offerings.  What the buffet does offer is an amazing array of vegetarian options--tasty, spicy and delicious options--chana masala (chick pea masala), palak paneer and various other vegetable-based deliciousness.  But the buffet isn't solely for the vegetable lover.  The Tamba buffet also carries several chicken dishes in well-crafted sauces.  If you've eaten at a few Vegas Indian buffets, you'll know that tasty and spicy foods are rare.  So if you're near the south side of the strip for lunch, you can't do much better.  As for the dinner or regular dishes (not in buffet form), I haven't tried them, but several India-born friends have told me that Tamba is the best Indian restaurant in town.",

Service was good, their ice tea is super good, and the bathrooms are really cool. (I'm a sucker for nice bathrooms)  ALSO, you can get free parking with this place.  I'm sold. It is, however, in the back of a deserted strip mall, but if you can get over that its a good place to visit.    I have to say, the food made it all and the food was stellar!!! Great amount of vegetarian choices spiced just right and with a perfect amount of kick.  Nothing was bland, and everything was presented beautifully.  Really great place!

We decided we should try somewhere close that, preferably. wouldn't have very many tourists. Bring in Tamba.   We made a reservation thinking the place would be jam packed, however, it was not. We were seated immediately, not having to wait at all because the place wasn't crowded at all.   Their Chicken Tikka Masala was amazingly good. This is one of my favorite dishes, so I enjoy when I go to an Indian place that really makes it the way I like it. Their Naan was also delicious. We got the garlic naan, as well as the Alu Naan, which was also VERY good.   I'd definitely go here again if I am in the area. It is somewhat off the beaten path. I don't think the tourist have really found this gem of a restaurant.",

Don't bother ordering off the menu and you won't be complaining about bad service or long wait times for your food. Here's why Tamba has the best Indian buffet in town:  1. Huge selection with plenty of veggie options. I don't  think there's a bigger Indian buffet in Vegas. 2. Buffet is not set up against a wall so you can go down the row on both sides. No waiting! 3. Great naan and great rice. These are key. 4. All you can eat gulab jamin dessert. So good. 5. Friendly staff. We've been going for years and the owners, staff etc have always been extremely cordial to us. 6. 30 bucks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hard to beat that. 7. Great recipes of standard dishes that should satisfy most everyone. 8. The place has Indian folks arriving in big numbers. There is no way an entire Indian family would go there and bring their non-English speaking, sari-adorned grandma, who happily eats with her hands, if this wasn't the real deal. 9. Free parking. Pay 5 bucks next door at the lot and you get it back with your receipt when you leave. Sweet!",

Clean, Dimly lit, smaller tables and with Indian decor throughout - this place had a casual yet intimate atmosphere.  The service was fast and friendly - the staff seemed to genuinely appreciate our business.  We ordered authentic Indian dishes - Prawn Mackne, Classic Chicken curry & .  The dishes were generously proportioned, full of spices and flavor.  Combined with the Yelp discount - 2 dinner entrees, 3 drinks & an appetizer came out to a rather modest price of $65.00  Tamba may not be on anyone's 5 star list of restaurants - but we enjoyed an unexpected yet exceptional dining experience.",

    "text": "VEGETARIANS BEWARE !   Tamba serves meat in Vegetarian Dishes and does not even care to apologize.  Myself and four friends visited Tamba for lunch buffet on Jan 18, 2015. While having our buffet lunch, I realized there were \"chicken pieces\" in \"Sambar\". I thought it was just my bowl of Sambar , NOPE all my four friends also found chicken pieces in their Sambar bowls. (Sambar is a South Indian dish made with lentils and vegetables)  Please see the pictures attached as proof. (go to photo gallery of this restaurant in yelp in case you do not see it along with my review post)  I was SHOCKED and called the waiter to show our Sambar bowls with chicken, he neither was apologetic and said he would check and get back.  As I did not see the waiter come back for a while, I walked to the elderly person I believe he was the owner of the restaurant and explained him the issue with chicken pieces in Sambar.   To my utter dismay, instead of being apologetic he raised his voice and was acting shocked saying that he himself set up the Sambar dish in the buffet.  Being an Indian, with respect to elders (here the owner of the restaurant) I continued to be polite and informed him that it is a SERIOUS OFFENSE. One cannot serve a vegetarian dish with meat in it, if it does have meat they need to highlight in the description of the dish in buffet table.  He continued to raise his voice and was defending himself, whereas I was trying to be polite and making sure that this NEVER happens. I pity the vegetarian customers who ate their lunch with Sambar earlier in Tamba on same day.  This elderly person continued his arguments and in no ways was apologetic and instead was saying someone else would have done that. Whatever might be the reason one cannot serve meat in a pure vegetarian dish.  While he continued to defend himself in a high pitch voice, the customers around that time stopped by and were shocked to know about Sambar having chicken pieces in it.  Finally, the waiter intervened, took this hot headed elder person away and they removed the Sambar from the buffet menu.  Neither the Owner nor the waiter offered a sincere apology for their GRAVE mistake.  *** At the end, I would like to WARN all VEGETARIANS who visit Tamba restaurant to be careful when eating any dish they serve. ***  I am glad my wife was not around with me for lunch buffet on that day, she is a vegetarian. It would have been a life time regret for her.",

Even the waiter said, they might be looking alike, but tasting same? How can the butter chicken curry wont have taste of butter and chicken when chicken taste different then malai kofta.  2. the waiter who took our order sounded less helpful.  3. He was sexist. Me and my husband with our kids were there to have dinner, he handed over the bill to him to pay, though i took out my credit card and paid, he still came back and thanked him for the visit, to which I pointed out it was me not my husband who paid.  The positive: 1. Ambience was nice.  2. The waiters who served water and took our plates were nice.",

Additional reason for us to eat at this place was that we didn't have our own car (for obvious reasons) otherwise there are better place to eat Indian Food in Las Vegas.   The buffet on the weekend costed us $14.95 + taxes per person but the food was not worth the cost.   At first, this place only had 3 chicken dishes in the buffet. The buffet consisted mainly of North Indian and South Indian dishes.   Starting with 3 chicken dishes, the Tandoori Chicken was the worst tandoori chicken I had in my life. Tiny drumsticks, dry and overcooked chicken is the best way this tandoori chicken can be described. Chicken curry and chicken tikka masala were okay and edible.   Among the South Indian dishes, idli (rice cake) was very dry. Sambhar (curry that goes with idli) was okay.   Among North Indian dishes, Black dal was not good at all. Naan was dry with no garnishing as opposed to the picture shown in one of the pictures posted by someone. There was zucchini dry dish mixed in Indian spices which was tasting like pumpkin. This was the first time I had seen this dish in any Indian restaurant. I don't discourage creativity but this was not a stand out creation. Navratna korma was okay taste wise.   Taking about deserts, there were two deserts: rice pudding and carrot halwa. These are two most famous deserts in Indian cuisine. Unfortunately, both the recipes were disaster. Both the recipes were too too sweet as if they have got extra supply of sugar...  Overall, if you are looking for good Indian food, this is NOT the place to go. If you are thinking of trying Indian food for the first time at this place, please read this review...  Pictures are attached for reference.",

    "text": "A little secret hidden in the Hawaiian marketplace, Tamba was a surprising find and the quality was outstanding.  I was with a party of 5 and we all got something different and spent the evening swapping tastes of each others dishes. I myself had \"Palak Paneer\" and \"Yellow Rice\". The paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu. The rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked/dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nan.  The dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor. The music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superb.  While this restaurant is in Vegas, the prices were a little high than I'd normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location. Good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books. There are specific ones for Tamba that could have saved us a bit.  With all that said, while the food was excellent, the staff was superb, and the atmosphere was inviting, the restrooms were atrocious. I was pretty shocked considering the dining experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a little.  Overall I still give Tamba 4/5, but please folks, take care of those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be a 5.",

I am in Vegas quite a bit for work and my coworkers and I are always searching for dinner options that don't require you to win big before you can eat.  Thanks to Open Table, we found this hidden little gem.  The feeling of the restaurant is pretty generic.  The website gives the impression that you will be walking into a luxurious setting complete with red velvet cushions and dramatic draperies.  Um, not so much, but we clearly weren't looking for trendy so no big deal.  We had booked a party of 6, which ended up being a party of four.  The host was nice about it, but, unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have too many options for 4-tops so we ended up sitting at a table for six.  I guess they get a lot of large groups?  I started with a manhattan.  When it came out a dark red, I was a little concerned that it wasn't made correctly, but after tasting, it was just right.  I had the butter chicken, which was rich and delicious, but not too heavy.  My friends didn't really know what they wanted so the server just brought out a few different dishes to share.  One of my friends had a spicy chicken dish that was fantastic.  In hindsight, I wish we would have asked what they were.  All in all, it was a great meal, friendly service, and we were all able to get out of there for around $20 per person.  Woo hoo!",

The website is kinda deceiving.  They show the nice lounge area (which is NOT where they seat you for dinner).  The lounge area was nice, but it wasn't open at all when I was there. (and I left at 10pm)  The food was pretty good.  I couldn't believe that the entrees didn't come with Naan or anything.  Everything (Dal, Naan, etc.) had to be ordered a la carte (for an extra charge).  We ordered the Naan and Roti which only came with four pieces each.   Maybe I'm just used to going to places where the Naan is free and you get it by the basket-load.  I would definitely go back again if I wanted Indian food while in Vegas.  The service was excellent too.  Very attentive and quick.",

I went alone, as the rest of my compadres were busy at the blackjack tables, or somewhere else doing more \"Vegasy\" things, and the hostess sat me immediately, gave me a menu, and made sure I received my H20.    The waiter came, discussed the wine and beer list and suggested a beer-- the name I forget, but it was great.  I ordered the Navrattan Korma, and sort of expected your typical Indian Navrattan Korma, but was pleasantly surprised to receive it with a nice kick-- seriously spiced right!  VERY tasty.   When he first put down the dish I figured I'd eat about half of it, but I polished it off and would have continued eating if there had been more... I've been to Vegas a few times, and have never been all that happy with the food, so it was a real treat to go somewhere this good.  It was truly the best meal I have ever had in Las Vegas.",

If you can walk or take a taxi, do that instead.   First thing that throws us off is the prepay for lunch buffet. I mean, this is the only restaurant I know where you have to prepay for the buffet. Yes, the spread of the dishes is good; that is where we were deceived :(  The veggie dishes were bland and lacked the flavor and punch of the Indian spices! The 'Malai Kofta' was too salty. The 'saag paneer' lacked paneer and was only a mishmash of spinach; the chole was OK and lacked the punch as well. The Idlis: like rubber! Upma was OK.   From the desserts, the Gulab Jamun was OK and the Custard was alright too. But then, he placed small containers to fill them up. We filled our stomachs with mostly the desserts(not a healthy way, I know) and for a high-price of almost $13 per person.   There are better Indian restaurants, I would recommend. Go to Gandhi's or India Place instead and be treated to some flavorful food and better service.  And waiters in Tamba: Grow up and dont play 'Catch ball' when you have customers...and by 'Ball' I mean...you know what?  And to end this, I AM NOT GOING THERE AGAIN!",

    "text": "Walked in July 3 for diiner, asked if we were going to order off the menu or from the buffet.  Decided on the buffet, and was told that we would have to pay before being seated. Was told the buffet was $40 dollars for two people. Gave the front desk a $100 bill.   Tamba Cashier: Do you have anything smaller?  Me: No, I don't. (I wanted to get the change)  TC: We can't break this bill.  Me: So, how will I get my change back?  TC: Well, we don't have anything else, because everybody else has been paying with $100 bills.   At this point, I was going to argue with the cashier, talk to the manager, or suggest that they go to one of the other restaurants nearby to break a few hundreds to manageable change for their register, but my date pulled out her wallet and paid the bill.   During the meal, asked for a Coke and a lassi, which added another $5.39 to the total bill. Turns out that drinks aren't included in a $20/person buffet. What?  (But water is free, so don't think you can't get a bargain out of Las Vegas.) If the Coke is coming out from a fountain station, is it normal to ask the diner, \"Do you want ice in that?\"   Leaving the restaurant, had the bill for the drinks with me and $6 ready to pay.   Me: Hey, we also got drinks. I'd like to pay up. (Hands the bill and money over.)  TC: Sir, we don't have any change available and can't give you your $.61 back ... (while holding $1 to give back to me)  Me: You know what, just keep it. Peace out.   The food review: We wish that there were tags describing what we were eating. Wanting to try something new, we had passed by Tamba before while walking the Strip, just because we didn't know it was at the Hawaiian Marketplace. Her being vegetarian, Indian food was a good choice since meat isn't so prevalent in the diet.  She says that the food was spicier than what she was prepared for, but there was a nice variety.  As someone who will eat everything, it was a pleasant meal and flavorful.  I understand the need to economize during this economy, but plastic plates for the buffet and plastic cups for water?  And the containers for sauces are little styrofoam bowls?  What an ecological disaster.  For the Coke and lassi, we were given glass tumblers, which was good, I guess.  My final assessment is that the food was good, but the experience was bad bad bad.",

Normally I don't go out of my way to eat fish, however the fish in the meat sample platter was cooked perfectly with a light crust and a lot of flavor without a \"fishy\" taste. The lamb was very tender and didn't have excessive fat either. We had the Garlic Naan, Tikka Masala with chicken, curry with Lamb, and a spinach curry with rice and Mango Lassi drinks. All of the meat was very tender and the spices were perfect. We also ended up getting the mango and pistachio ice cream which I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy it was.  Our server was very kind and he seemed like he was happy to serve us. He always kept our waters full at all times without being overbearing.   Overall, it was a great experience at a classy Indian restaurant with a polite server and exceptional food! I would definitely recommend trying it on your next visit to the Strip!",

We stumbled onto Tamba while searching for a place for dinner.  If the customers are an indication, Tamba offers authentic Indian cuisine.   We had a fantastic appetizer called aloo tiki cholera chaat.  It consisted of potatoes, chickpeas and cilantro in a sweet, spicy, sour sauce.  It was breathtakingly complex.  Do yourself a favor and split it with a friend.  The okra bindi masala was exquisite as was the eggplant bengan bartha.    We will be back.  If you are \"sick of the strip\" you can have a wonderful reasonably priced meal a very short walk from the Elara.    Try it.... you will not be disappointed.",

The pasta they had was really good, had Indian taste to Italian dish. They usually have 2-3 curries of which one of them is panner based and one would be mix veg type.  The same goes for meat options, appetizer and curries. They have biryani and dal rice which feels filing and satisfying.  Gulab jamun and kheer to end the meal and your sweet tooth.

They had three: chicken curry, butter chicken, and chicken tandoori. The curries were actually quite spicy to my surprise but not that salty/flavorful in my opinion. I heard the tandoori was good though.  They had other dishes like: idly, Chana masala, and daal.  I was a bit disappointed to not see any paneer. They instead used tofu which is odd because I don't usually see tofu in Indian dishes (?). I didn't think this dish was that great unfortunately. The curry sauce for that dish was also a bit weak.  Raita was good. The mango custard was actually incredibly sweet despite it looking a bit watery.  Service was nice.",

We went in the building which sadly is deserted on the first floor and one of the employees directed us upstairs.  He could see I was ill and got the manager who immediately got us a table.  Once I had been seated and started getting back to normal we ordered.  I had the butter chicken which was amazing and my BF had the curried Goat.  Our waiter was shocked he asked for the goat and had to make sure they still had some but came back smiling and letting us know it was still available.  He said it was fantastic.  Our waiter was attentive and kept a positive attitude even though and indian couple behind us ordered several things and kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience with anyone.   It was a great meal and we would go back.  At the time one of the half price outlets had coupons to reduce the price.  We also ate here on Christmas day for the lunch buffet and while it was good none of the entrees were marked and even a few indian customers questioned what the dishes were.  I was not nearly as impressed with the buffet.",

I generally don't go to the buffet lunches as they usually don't offer the best selection (everything chicken) and quality but my friend said, the buffet is actually good and they even offer lamb curry/korma (you just have to ask for it and the waiter will bring it to  your table).  The flavors of all the curries were fantastic and deserving of 4-5 stars, the only problem is every curry was WAY TOO SALTY.  Not sure if this was intended being that it was a buffet and perhaps they want you to fill up on rice or nan.  Had they cut the salt in half, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.  Apparently they must be doing something right because out of the whole food court in Hawaiian Village, they were the only restaurant left standing.  I would potentially go back again but only if I needed some extra sodium in my diet.",

The internet can be so deceiving.  First of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is (and I quote), \"designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi\" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V-Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V-Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley (Gandhi's and Gaylord's), in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian/Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, \"hipster hangout.\" Next please.",

Malai Paneer Yellow Daal Mutter Paneer  The last time (around 2 years ago) they also made Jain Malai Kofta (during dinner)  I have been to this place around 4 times and its always a saviour :)  This time around they were very busy so the service sucked (its not like this always), but yes sometimes we take the buffet, so not much service is required anyways. We could see several people waiting to be seated and they were also getting a little bit frustrated.  Would definitely recommend this place for good Jain food.",

We came during lunch and were able to eat off of the buffet and get unlimited non-alcoholic drinks for $13.  Being vegetarians, we were totally stoked that they had at least 5 different dishes in addition to rice, naan, and those weird soda break things.  I learned that I love Dal Makni, Malai Paneer, and Punjabi Curry, which would be things I would normally not get to try because I always order my favorite, Muttar Paneer.  Anyway, the service was really great, the location was awesome, and the food was so incredibly tasty. Five Stars alllll the way!!!",

We found this place on yelp and were skeptical about the place since the location was quite hidden and not many people were dining in.   Anyway, we were there last night. It was our first time to have Indian cuisine, so we absolutely didn't know what to order. Our server was very welcoming, friendly, and very informative. He made very good recommendations for our entrees which was called Karahi Chicken. It was AWESOME! It had the right amount of spice and had such a great thick blend of curry with onions tomatoes, peppers, and cilantro. Served with garlic flavored Nan. I ordered the Ashoka's Feast which consisted a taste of India's most popular dishes and that was amazing.  So to sum it up. Great service from our waiter. Great food because my boyfriend was very happy at the end of dinner, even though he was feeling down when he lost $150 gambling. Lol.",

I cook a lot at home because its not easy finding restaurants to eat at, especially in Las Vegas, the steakhouse capital of the world. I decided I needed to get out for Valentine's Day and chose to go Indian. I came across Tamba's amazing website and easily made up my mind. After making the reservation I read a few revues on Google and they worried me a bit, but I wasn't going to be shaken. I'm so glad I stayed with it, I loved this place. Staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! We tried the Bhel Puri for an appetizer, based off of the waiters recommendation, great choice. Then for entrees we went with the Aloo Gobi & Chana Masala. Both were amazing and complimented each other nicely, great for sharing. She went with a glass of house Chard, which turned out to be Mondavi(Nice!) and I tried one of the many Indian Imported beers. Hayward 5000 was the beer I went with and was perfect. Gotta find that at Lee's Discount Liquor, hope they have it.   One side note, when they ask you for bread, it's not included. That was awkward. Also, parking is a bit rough.  Over all this was probably one of the least expensive Vday dinners I've ever had and also one of the most satisfying.",

On that note, Me and my boyfriend went and ate here about a week ago bc a friend I had in my summer class at UNLV worked here.  Although he wasn't there that night we went anyways and everyone was so nice.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  I completely disagree with the yelp from Sang whatever bc we ordered the Chicken tikka masala and it was awesome.  We also got the lamb vindaloo and the combo together was phenomenal.  The chicken tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat.  We had samosas of course and they were pretty good.  From my memory I've had better but everything else was delicious.  Our water was never empty and everyone was so nice.  We also had some dessert, a round cake like ball thing (dont know what its called) and some carrots.  Very good as well.    The location is a little strange (I thought it was closed when we were going there) but they were open.  The atmosphere was great, the service was great, and the food was awesome.  The rest of the night me and my boyfriend kept saying how nice of a dinner that was and have been craving Indian food ever since! A+",

    "text": "I was trying to find a nice place to take my girlfriend for her birthday dinner.  First, we were looking for a Greek place, but didn't find any with decent reviews, so since we have had good luck with Indian food in the past, I figured I'd scour Yelp for suggestions.  I found Tamba to be in the top five on Yelp and found every place in the list to have mixed reviews.  After looking at the web sites of the top five, their menus and plenty of thought, I finally decided on Tamba.  I used <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> to make our reservation for 7pm Saturday night.  Since this place is in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the strip, I figured it would be packed.  In fact, one of the reviews said to make sure you get a reservation or your wait could exceed two hours.  When we arrived, the place was pretty empty.  I believe there were only four or five tables taken at that point, so we were greeted by the manager and he wished my girlfriend a happy birthday.  Nice touch.    I am actually glad the place was empty because the waiter spent a lot of time talking over the menu options and giving us recommendations.  During our conversation with the waiter, we talked about the lamb dishes and he could tell we were hesitant, so he brought over sample for us to try.  It was so good, I chose the Roghan Gosht as my main dish.  My girlfriend chose the Butter Chicken and we started with the Sea Bass appetizer.  On the spice scale, I'd say the lamb was a 5 out of 10 and the butter chicken was a 3.  The wine selection was average, but my girlfriend really enjoyed the fruity martini.  The price was better than I expected for dinner on the strip in Las Vegas.  We both had two drinks, an appetizer, two main dishes, rice, garlic nan and two desert items and got out of there for around $70 and that included the tip.    Two more signs that Tamba serves good Indian food; by the time we left (8:30ish), the place was packed and there were a lot of actual Indian people dinning there.  We both said that we would go back.",

    "text": "Oh Yelpers, how you have failed me!    My boyfriend and I found Tamba's advertisement in one of Vegas's books during our visit, and decided to go here for dinner after reading the \"good reviews\" and ratings on yelp.  After finally having eaten there,  I would give this place HALF a star if I could, for its bad food and terrible service!  I live in Silicon Valley---a mecca of Indian restaurants and cafes-- and eat Indian food at least once a week. (It's my latest addiction).  I know good curry when I taste it, and let me tell you now before you waste your time and money: you will not find good curry here.  We went for the \"dinner buffet\" which, it turns out, \"was reserved for private parties only.\" So we ended up ordering the butter chicken and a lamb curry with some naan off of the menu.  But the waiter brought out what he called \"chicken tikka masala\", and when we told him it wasn't what we ordered, he then said he misspoke and it was actually \"butter chicken\" after all.  Either way, it tasted like water.  No flavor whatsoever.  The lamb curry on the other hand... was a SPOONFUL of SALT with every bite.  YUCK!  I've never abandoned an Indian meal in my life, no matter how mediocre.  But I could not get myself past even half this meal.  Maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier, or, \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"if i mix the two curries together, I would find a happy medium.\"  How wrong I was! There was no happiness to be found there. :(  To top it off, when our bill came, we were charged $15 for the \"chicken tikka masala\" instead of butter chicken, and told our server about the mistake.  He said, \"It doesn't matter anyway, they're the same price.\"  Indeed not!  I corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14.  So he responded, \"Fine, I'll just COMP you the difference.\"  \"COMP\"? \"COMP\"??? Are you kidding me?!  You're not comping us anything!  We're just asking you to charge us for what we ACTUALLY ORDERED!  Don't think you're doing us any favors!  Finally, just to add insult to injury, they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the Vegas 24/7 booklet.  But when we gave him the \"coupon\", INSTEAD of taking 10% OFF, he ADDED 18% to our bill for gratuity!  HA! Unbelievable.  I guess, in Vegas,  you don't have to go to the casinos to lose your money!",

My tamarind shrimp was definitely spicy, but not excessively so. The mixed tandoori grill was excellent for those who do not like spicy food. THE PRESENTATION was good, especially for the mixed feasts and the grill. instead of just slopping the various dishes on the plate, each one is in a nice  stainless container. THE SERVICE was excellent, even though we had a large party. We had several people who had never eaten Indian food and the waiter took the time to explain the various dishes, how to eat them and various nuances of Indian food.  RECOMMEND",

One of the best Idlis I have eaten outside India.  I had to take a STAR off because they employ kids to serve water and plates.Somehow dint like the idea of that.",

I'm very critical of Indian restaurants but this lunch buffet hits the spot like a triple chilled, quintuple distilled, boutique vodka. Service is hit or miss but the food makes up for it. If you're jonesing for different edible fare in Vegas in between the $80 buffets and the Subway in that crappy casino on the Strip, this is a solid choice to soak up your alcohol indiscretions. If you shoot fire out of your bunghole the next day, it might be Tamba. Then again, it might be the result of table service at Marquee. Who knows?",

We love Indian food - we are not Indian so we know what we like.  Tamba has a great selection of vegetarian food with minimal meat items - we are carnivores but are just as happy with meatless dishes there.  Each time we have gone, we have found several items on the lunch buffet that we have never tasted before so we know that they change up the buffet items regularly.  Their tandoori chicken is the best I have had - it is always moist and tasty, not dried out or overcooked.  they always have a paneer dish there, a soup, lots of veggie dishes like aloo gobi, etc.  they always have a dessert on the buffet and loads of hot naan.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Indian food or is just learning - their buffet is a great way to jump in!",

Deep inside the Hawaiian Marketplace where even the KFC failed and shuttered it's doors lies Tamba, the lone restaurant in what at one time was a glorious food court.   Up the escalator and inside, you get a whiff of the buffet and hear the soft and trendy music. The perfect sound track for the inevitable food coma that the awesome buffet is about to give.   Loved this place so much the first time we skipped the Indian spot across from our hotel and drove straight to Tamba.   Tamba in 2010. Tamba in 2011 too I'm sure!",

Our server was friendly enough but after being seated it took a solid 10 minutes before anybody approached our table and 20 to order.

We have two boys (10 and 14) and all four of us were trying to plan how to go back when we could on our stay here. We had dinner one night (ordered off menu) and buffet two days later for lunch- both times it was awesome. Lunch is less expensive of course. We tried several new dishes in the buffet and we all loved everything.  We lamented our shows all started at 7pm and they didn't open until 6pm for dinner :( but we found a way to get there for lunch! The service was outstanding- a super classy place tucked away in an odd little location. Well worth searching it out! ;)",

We were looking at one of the \"Feasts\" but the waiter informed us that its only enough food for one person. We ended up getting the Lamb Korma and we were happy we did! We ordered a side of plain naan and rice to go with our meal. It all came out super quick and we scarfed it down, including every drop of sauce we could soak up with the naan! Medium spice was perfect for us- it had a good kick and wonderful flavor. We were relieved the lamb was cooked well, that's usually a toss up. Good portions at a reasonable price for the strip, we ended up paying less than $15 each (including tip and tax) for some really yummy Indian food that filled us up!",

They offer a multisampler dinner which gives you small portions of 4 or 5 things.  I got the buddah's delight which included a few vegetarian dishes and also included rice and naan for $21 but I didn't like everything that was offered.  I would rather just have one large portion of a dish I really liked for $13 instead.  The saag paneer was incredible.  It's amazing how every restaurant does it differently.  This was more pureed than others.    I looked at their selection for the lunch buffet and it still looks great.  Look forward to checking it out again.",

Yes the service is lacking with odd waiters who could use a few lessons in good manners but the food was always delicious.   For dinner, highly recommend ordering pani puri to start with. The puri was crispy and the pani perfectly made. Also don't miss out on the lamb chops! Weird to order at an Indian restaurant but honestly they were incredible. We kept ordering more and more plates because we just couldn't stop eating them! Oh course we tried all the stables, butter chicken, chicken biryani, paneer tikka, palak panner, garlic naan and raitha. Everything was delicious and nothing was left over. The dishes are kinda on the small side so it's good for sharing and trying a bunch of items.   Ok, so this lunch buffet is pretty extensive and basically has everything your hungover tired body needs--samosas, upma, uttapam, idli, sambar, kadhi, naan, fish curry, chicken like 5 different ways and everything in between.  Definitely give Tamba a try and be your own judge :)",

Hugely disappointing.  Absolutely no flavor, not even on the outside.   The goat biriyani is quite spicy, even if you ask to decrease the spice to a mild level. Our waiter said it ia because the spice is added to the meat itself and that decreasing the spice is hard.   The rhogan josh was DELICIOUS. I literally tried to lick the entire dish.   The chicken tikka masala was subpar, not what you would expect because it was sort of bland and did not have well cut pieces.    For the best bang for your buck,  order ashoka's plate. You get a lot of variety and option to try many things. The gulab jamun on it was delicious and a great way to end the meal. The dal on it though had a very monotonous flavor.",

This is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace between the MGM and Planet Hollywood filled with many vendors and eateries so it may be hard to find. Going inside the building where this restaurant is located was kind of creepy because it was super empty! However, going inside the restaurant, we saw multiple patrons enjoying their food and the atmosphere proved to be very cool and modern.   I shared an order of Malai Kofta and Chicken Tikka Masala with my bf, because we were hungry but not super hungry...? Hahaha what does that mean I don't get myself... anyways both items were really good... my boyfriend and I gobbled both of them up! Portions were pretty big compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to... also their bowls are pretty cool (they were shaped like a spoon? You have to see it, I can't really explain the weird shape right now) but need to be handled to great care as you can easily spill whatever item on your pants (like my boyfriend on his favorite khakis... RIP favorite khakis).  Waiters here were pretty friendly, cool, and funny. What I liked was that they kept filling up my water! It's like they know me... they know I need to quench my thirst.  Overall, a good time having Indian food here in Vegas! I definitely would come here again for some Indian food. Enjoy!",

Subdued lighting, calming music, wonderful smells. A little oasis in the midst of the Strip.   Food is very good for a buffet. A little spicy as it should be. Very friendly waitstaff.

Tamba is situated conveniently near the middle/ mid South area of the strip. The restaurant was clean and had a very pleasant ambiance that is a fusion of modern and traditional elements. The staff was very friendly and attentive to us during our meal. The buffet itself was quite good. There was a variety of options for vegetarians and non vegetarians. The food quality was surprisingly good and there were a number of healthy options. The buffet was pretty reasonably priced for Las Vegas- about $15/ person including tax.

Everyone here is extremely friendly and very welcoming. Service is top notch. I love their tea as well. On our last day in Vegas we went there to have tea. Unfortunately we had purchased vouchers for a lunch buffet at a different place otherwise we would definitely eat here. I would go back again to this restaurant anytime I'm in Vegas. I'm already craving for some biryani right now. If is so yummehhhh. I am going back again next year and definitely will go to this place just to indulge myself with the delicious food.

I called and talked to the owner about 25 people coming to the party and I told him what we need. He was very gentle and said anything you guys like, we'll make it for you. So, when we got there, our table was all set up, and I had the chance to meet the owner. He told me how the food will be prepared. Our guests were surprised to see the quality of the food and the service. The food was awesome and starters were amazing. I highly recommend this place. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.",

And when you eat there for lunch you will see Indians eating there too [great sign in my book!]  I love their Indian techno music.  They have a very nice motif, it's very clean, and the staff is on it.  You can be in and out of here [minus parking] at lunch time in 30 mins if you needed to be.",

It's hidden inside a tiny mall that's mostly vacant; a bit eerie at night.   The service here is actually pretty good in comparison to other Indian restaurants around town but for a place on the strip it's actually average at best. I used the yelp check to get the 10% off. The server knew immediately when I raised my phone so it's nice the staff is competent and very friendly.   The quality of food in comparison to other Indian places around town is a bit sub standard. Especially with respect towards price. They have a nice variety from North to South Indian dishes. Your standard tikka masala meal is there as well as a butter chicken dish aka chicken makkni.   The naan is very good especially when fresh from the plain to the garlic you can't really go wrong.  This is a three star review because of poor parking accessibility and quality of food. If the staff wasn't so great this would have been a 1 star. All in all average food with above average staff is a 3 star.",

After walking forever and searching endlessly on Yelp, FINALLY we found vegetarian food! They have some meat items like chicken tikka masala, but tons of veg options (at least in the lunch buffet).  The idly are fluffy and the sambar is very good. The paneer was mostly missing in action and not very good when it was to be found, but the halwa was delicious!!  Given that it was lunchtime, I'm shocked that this place wasnt more crowded. In fact, there were only a couple other patrons there (They are kind of tucked away). Cheapest buffet ever! It was small, but only like $13 and had many good options.  To find it- just follow the signs, and they'll lead you into some weird sliding glass doors of a deserted looking building. Then go up some escalators and you're there!",

The restaurant does not border the street, rather it is inside a building with several stores.  You will see a sign right on Las Vegas Boulevard.  I arrived at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and they were quite friendly at that late hour and didn't rush me at all.  Other people came in after me. The seating is comfortable.  I got a booth.  The waiter was attentive and that was nice. I had lamb vindaloo and I've been eating lamb vindaloo as my Indian dish for a long time now.  The food tasted good and my raita was pretty nice as well. However, for the next two days I had \"the runs\" or diarrhea.  I couldn't taste anything wrong with the food there. I've eaten a lot of Indian food and it's never given me the runs like that food did for me.  I'm really lucky that nothing ran during my long flight home.  I'm reasonably confident that my upset stomach was not the result of something else that I ate or drank.",

We had dinner here once and lunch 4 times and already can't wait to go back! Our favorite dishes: malai kofta, dosa, samosas, garlic naan, kheer, gulab jamun.

Honestly this place was a lifesaver! I had had enough of Las Vegas with its cheesy, decadent food options... everything with mayo on it or some creamy goop. Or loads of carbs everywhere. And then at Tamba's buffet I got really really good food; hugely filling. The dessert - gulab jamun which many people get wrong (too dense or in thick stale sugar syrup) was perfect as well. Although the 'katories' or styrofoam bowls I took the curries in were flimsy, they helped me taste everything separately and not have everything mixed in my plate. I liked that. The entry to this place made us doubt it but then we saw it was full of people having good good food. I liked the no-fuss atmosphere of the place too. It was a place you could just chill at, relax and eat. Well done guys!",

Strangely placed on the second level of a nearly empty strip mall along the Strip, you might not know it was there. Beautiful inside with soft Indian music playing, this was a place I could forget that I was in Las Vegas and enjoy delicious curry. I shared the goat curry with my husband since the serving size easily serves 2 reasonable appetites along with rice and naan. The naan bread was delicious! The curry had a nice light spice and was probably a bit too salty, but I still loved it. The lime ginger soda was unexpectedly tasty too. I could see going back here a few more times if I were stuck here longer. The waitstaff was attentive too, though there weren't many diners.   Okay, this isn't a place I would typically give 5 stars, but it was just what I needed at the time. One request - draft beer would be a good addition to the menu.",

The strip mall where they reside is actually a ghost town with this the only establishment that's viable.   But once you get past that, the food is a solid \"B grade\". Stay away from their tandoori chicken or the \"paalak paneer\" gravy dish. My friends had a \"difficult afternoon\" shall we say mildly after the meal.   They also refused to split the bill amongst the 13 of us who wanted to pay separately on our credit cards. The person serving us \"suggested\" that we charge it on one card and deal with splitting the bill ourselves in a not very polite way.",

    "text": "Tucked away on the strip in the Hawaiian Marketplace area, this is a hidden gem.  So I'll admit it was my first time having Indian food.  Luckily I was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have.  We went 'family style' so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered.    First I want to say the service and staff here were amazing.  My water glass never went less than half full.  Kudos! Our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get.  I would say he went above and beyond!   To start off, we tried the Vegetable Samosa's and Vegetable Pakora's.  The Samosa's reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas.  Accompanied with the sauces, these were great! The Pakora's were good also but a little too much breading.  For the main course, we went with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! I scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased.   As for the chicken and rice dishes, there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself. We even had much leftover! The garlic naan came out warm, flavorful and perfect.    Overall I was delighted for this to be my first Indian food experience.",

Whole staff is very friendly and the decor and ambience is laid back and mixed with history. Our server Kumar was the man and so friendly. This place is a gem amongst the overpriced hotel food and all the fast-food American and Mexican joints around.  This will be one of our stops everytime we are in vegas!",

Las Vegas can be pricy, but Tamba's dishes are not that expensive and I even venture to say that the prices are actually inexpensive for the quality of the food.  You can't go wrong with any of their food entrees.  The service was definitely some of the best I have ever experienced at any restaurant.  Not to mention my waitress was BEAUTIFUL!!  Haha.

That's like charging for buns  separately when selling burger! Their pani puri is the best I've ever had. Tandoori chicken is also of good size and excellent taste.

I'm so glad we found this charming gem hidden upstairs in the back of a nondescript marketplace.  Kumar, our server, helped make our dinner so perfect.  He was friendly and professional, guiding us with selections from the menu by suggesting his personal favorites.  We started with samosa chaat appetizer and kabuli naan.  We shared a main of prawns in a flavorful red pepper curry with basmati rice.  Each dish was spot-on with a balance of flavor and spice.  We found the prices to be reasonable, especially by Vegas standards.  If you're looking for flavorful Indian cuisine away from the crowds, Tamba is the place.",

There was huge variety of dishes for for Veg and non-Veg. Everything was spiced perfectly and tasted fresh. Here what was on menu: -Idli (soft), Sambhar -Chutneys (Delicious) -Upama ( Best I have had so far) -Zucchini curry -Kadhi Pakoda ( oh so yumm!) -Yellow dal tadka -Cumin Rice -Navratan Korma ( good flavors) - Shahi Paneer (Okay) -Pakoris (Crispy) - Chiken tikka - shahi Chicken curry -Lamb curry -Chicken biryani -Sooji Halwa - Kheer   The server took a very long time to bring the water and clear the plates but food was delicious and we ended up having alot to eat. We again went there for buffet the next day and weren't disappointed in food.  We didn't try ala-carte so wouldn't say anything. But I will recommend trying their buffet!",

Now what used to be proper sit down ala-carte place for Dinner became a horrible $17.99 mandatory buffet place with horrible food choices.  Plus you get to see attitude shown by horrible tourist who have no clue about respect mistreating the Tamba staff.  On one occassion I saw a Indian tourist who was treating an old server from Tamba with rude finger movements to give him spoon for achar. These people who tour USA from India forget that US gives respect to both Owner and waiter equally and was a very poor sight to see.  The Jain food was equally horrible and I would say if you want good food go anywhere else but Tamba.  To Tamba Management if you are reading, stop this nonsense Tourist bus service. It may seem easy money but has tainted ur brand severely !!!!!",

    "text": "It was a very hungry Sunday Evening. We were on the look out for a very good Indian Restaurant to complete our Trip at the Vegas. I've been to this place multiple number of times every time I visit Vegas. This place is located on the strip in the same complex as Chili's. Finding this place could be very challenging since there are no proper direction boards when we look from the strip. You need to step inside the plaza and keep walking to the escalators to reach here. Parking is charged which can be waived of if we show the Bill. The outside of this place looks very dull and no proper lights.   As we reached this place we were greeted by a staff named \"Kumar\" whom I've seen for about 3 or 4 years at place now. The inside of the restaurant needs some more lights. The menu is quite good. We ordered for Samosa chat, Ashoka, Chicken kabab, Chicken Curry and a Lamb side and some Lime juice. They did not make us wait for the food for long. I must say that every single item tasted really good. The meat was perfectly cooked and well served.   Even the lime juice was really good that we ordered for more. The Price of the dishes were a little on the higher side but we got a 10% discount for our Yelp check-in. Thank you Yelp :)  To summarize, I would say that this place is worth the visit since the restaurant did not disappoint us with the taste of their food. I will definitely visit the next time I visit Vegas.",

When I brought this to one of the servers he gave an excuse that they make Buffett for more than 500 ppl at a time so can't manage to keep the taste profile. That's such a pathetic outlook when u have to prepay $18 per head for buffet. Vegas strip has many other Indian eating options, the one in fashion mall food court is far better than this place. Stay away from this place unless u want to try tasteless Indian food",

My wife and I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma respectively, seriously the food was top notch.  The right amount of spices, sauce and heat.  The garlic naan was great too.  The only negative thing about the food is that they don't use Basmati rice... Seriously, an Indian restaurant that doesn't use Basmati rice???? UNHEARD OFF!!!   However, this is a very minor gripe, the food, decor, ambience more than make up for the choice of rice.  The decor is one that I have never seen in an Indian restaurant, but it works.  The music not being the standard Bollywood or cliche definitely is a welcome choice",

Moreover, they also have few South Indian dishes in buffet. Usually in buffet you get served with fresh bread called'NAAN'. But they just put it in buffet and it was dry, hard and cold. One more thing is that they might have contract with Thomas cook or some other travel agents so they bring their travellers during lunch time. So it's all crowded and mostly you have to rush to get the food and especially South Indian since most of them were South Indians! It's bit pricy compare to the food and service!",

I enjoyed the aloo gobi, and they gave me a huge portion. Idk how they even fit the lid on because it was practically overflowing. It was convenient to get to because it's right next to MGM. There is a place to sit and wait right outside the restaurant. The food came out quickly as well. This food just really hit the spot and it was great left over food when I had the munchies.",

    "text": "*Weekend lunch buffet review*  Our plan was to find some grub at Aria but we either found stuff that was too expensive or not very appealing. By this time we were STARVING so I whip out my trusty iPhone and used my Yelp app to find this place just across the street. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace all the way in the back.  The first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet. I thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not.   They had a lot of variety, at least 14 different items, and thought everything was just ok. One thing I thought was really good was their upma, it's like an Indian version of the Moroccan cous cous. It was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty. The chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry. The chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken, I had to dig around for some. What I noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes. I've never seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food.   They were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates. Bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us. Another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly, so I was just grabbing things blindly.   Overall it was just an OK experience. At least Tamba introduced me to a new dish, now all I have to do is find it here in LA!",

And it is totally worth the journey to get there.   I think one way to judge quality and authenticity of a restaurant is by the clientele. There were many people of Indian descent here, and that made us even more excited for our feast!  And what a feast it was!  I had Ashoka's feast which included and appetizer and then four small dishes and rice. It also included naan... And this was the first time I had ever been to an Indian restaurant where i did not have to order more naan. They served plenty.   The lamb roganjosh was prepared with a perfect blend of spices. The chicken masala also prepared just to taste. Everything was very flavorful and though try described it as spicey, nothing was too spicey.  This meal also included a donuthole dessert with a sweet caramel sauce.   They were able to accommodate our large party (15) on relatively short notice for a Saturday night.   If you're in the mood for Indian food while on the strip, check out Tamba!  The staff was extraordinarily attentive and professional.",

    "text": "It pains me to give 3 stars to this place when my first experience here only less than two months ago warranted about a 4-ish rating.    My boyfriend and I came in here about an hour before closing and instead of being greeted with a \"Hello, how are you this evening?\" spiel, we were told right off the bat to order only one entree since the kitchen was closing soon.  I thought that was a bit harsh and strange as the dining area was a little more than half full already.  The kicker was a group of women that showed up about 15 minutes prior to closing and the same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms.  Guess you have to show some skin, cleavage, possibly more... to override the rules, eh?    Service here on the whole part is excellent.  The food here is excellent and VERY fresh.  However, I highly do recommend not to order spicy as the last dish I ordered was heavily-overpowered with chili powder, but no taste.  Order medium, if you want a kick, but still can enjoy the flavors.  Portions are not big, but that is perfectly fine as they are definitely filling.  The garlic naan is good; samosas are forgettable and not worth it by any means; the korma is great; and I HIGHLY recommend the yellow/cumin rice as a side dish as it is superb.   The other knock-off is that they automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill.  It's one thing if it was a group of people and I understand that, but for just two people?  At least have a sign at the front desk or something on the menu that says this is going to be enforced.  It has nothing to do with us being cheap tippers or anything as we both vary between 15% to 20% on tipping (dependent on food/service etc...)  I know the last time I went with my boyfriend and a close friend of our's, this did not occur.  Was it because we \"inconvenienced\" them by coming in an hour before closing since the tone of the voice and body language of the host made it obvious?  Bizarre to say the least and this definitely did not go over well with the bf one bit.  The redemption was later on when I won money on the slots at Paris to cover up the dinner cost.     Pricey, yes, but what do you expect in Vegas?  $14 for channa masala (garbanzo beans in a sauce) is hilarious as you can go get a Trader Joe's frozen version of the same thing/taste for around $2 and change.  Expect to pay at least nearly $30 a person to give you a gauge of what to expect.    Unfortunately, this last experience did not go over well at all, especially with my boyfriend.  We won't be coming back and we'll look for another Indian food restaurant avenue that will hopefully show more class to its customers when we visit Vegas again.",
