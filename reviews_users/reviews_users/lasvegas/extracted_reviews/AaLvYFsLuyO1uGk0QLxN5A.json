I was really upset because my favorite dog was the patty melt. So I ended up ordering the red dog with the special cream cheese sauce which I did not get on my hot dog. Also wanted to order one of the specialty fries but couldn't because no cheese and no fries!.. this was really upsetting... the wings we orders was dryer than the desert in Las Vegas. I give 5 stars on the rainbow location but the one on the strip 2 stars....",

We came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and there were only 2 people in front of me, but it took a while to get my food (hubby went to try something else as he wasn't in the mood for hotdogs).   It started out as one person taking orders, making food, etc, so it took a while for me to actually get my food.  Hubby came back to order food from here too after browsing around, but I told him to go elsewhere b/c it was taking too long, and I'd already ordered. I got the dirty chilidog and dirty esquite (corn in a cup). The chili dog was amazing, and the bun was fantastic - crispy edges and perfectly buttered.  I had to save some for my husband to try since it was too good not to share.  The corn, absolutely delicious..... I can't wait to go back on future visits.",

We had the classic Dirt Dog, the Mutt Dog, and two different types of fries. My God. Our little meat-and-cheese loving hearts were in heaven! The fries were PIPING hot and fried to a perfect golden color, topped with roasted corn, cotija, and lots of other goodies. The dogs were enrobed in the best buns ever to be had. Vegas might be filled with Star chefs and their establishments, hip joints, eateries of all kinds; but Dirt Dog is king. We will always be back.",

My wife and I had the Mutt Dog, Dirty Chili Dog, Dirty Esquite, and Elote Fries with a Mexican Coke to wash it down. It was all SO DAMN GOOD, and we were so full afterwards! With all of the terrible buffet food in Vegas it is nice to know that there are people like the folks at Dirt Dog making truly good food at a good price! I am fairly certain that anything in the menu would be delicious. When we were there the wait was about 15 minutes (right at dinner time), but the staff were super friendly and even brought our food out to the table when it was ready. They also let us know before we ordered that there would be a slight wait. Go, you will not be disappointed!",

It's on the Wahlburger side if you're facing Bally's; in the first aisle of shops with Subway in the front. It'll be all the way in the back between Fuel Bar & Sin City Brewing Co.  I wanted to try the Elote Dog but the Green Dog seemed a more interesting choice. Bacon wrapped hotdog? Hell yeah! I was surprised to find the grilled onions & peppers had a lime or acid-based tartness that was not expected. Still, a good dog. Definitely want to try the Elote Dog now. In hindsight I should've gotten the Dirty Esquite (Elote/corn in a cup) to go with but I wasn't hungry at the time.  This place is a good choice for a quick bite to eat. Whether it's lunch, dinner or to combat the hangover blues. Limited seating  is the only con. Only two or three tables near the storefront.",

Let's start with that perfectly warm, buttered and crispy bun...that thing played A VITAL role in this mouth party. Then the chili was impeccably prepared. Not too sweet, or too salty...just pure perfection. As if this wasn't enough the actual bacon wrapped hot dog sent me over the edge. That thing had me ready to elope it at the little white wedding chapel it was so good to me. I told my boyfriend he had competition...as I had never felt a love quite like this.  It's been two days, and I can't get this thing outta my mind. Like, I'm about to buy a flight for this hot dog. Anyway, the experience was over just as quickly as it begin. I showed that dog no mercy as I inhaled it. This is a staple for me going forward. I would never visit the west coast and miss this dog.",

    "text": "Dirt Dog can do no wrong. Vegas is all about portions larger than life and buffets but their street food is also legit. The menu is really simple and I feel like it would be hard to go wrong with any of the options because they all look amazing. I opted for the Mutt Dog and my friend got the Green Dog (and no the Green Dog isn't faux meat, we aren't crazy). To be frank I'm not 110% sure what the garnishes on either hot dogs were but, oh, were they good and full of flavor. I'm from NY and I never got the hype of a NY hot dog at all and Dirt Dog just added on to that firm belief. I think the best part was that they served it on a lobster roll versus your generic hot dog buns. If I'm going to eat carbs, they're going to be worth it (not like I wouldn't eat it if it was a regular hot dog bun, but you get the point). The sole reason I knocked off a star is because I felt that the hot dogs could've been a little longer or thicker (no pun intended) for their price point. Rather than that, no complaints and I'm glad I tried it.",

Its a tiny little kiosk type store amidst many others, with no seating and you order to-go at the window. The food was tasty and decently priced. We got there maybe 10 minutes after they opened but they didn't have the ingredients to make the hot cheeto and elote covered hot dog I had been dreaming about for a year.... The fact that they were out of a key ingredient at the beginning of the day on a Saturday on a holiday weekend points to a logistics concern... But I ended up going with the standard elote dog and the flavors were really good. They also have deep fried Oreos served with a horchata whipped cream, and that stuff is worth dealing with las Vegas crowds for.",

I found this place through Yelp looking for a quick bite (in other words, something other than a sit down restaurant while I was visiting Vegas). Dirt Dog truly hit the spot as the local fare I was looking for! I usually don't crave hot dogs, but these hot dogs were definitely quality. Just walking up to the stand, I could see how much quality their put into their product, as almost all staff were chopping up their fresh ingredients. The staff were super helpful in navigating their menu and their food did not disappoint! From presentation to taste, I highly recommend stopping by Dirt Dog if you're on the West Coast! Their toasted bread buns were really what topped off their dishes. They held up really well and tasted so great alongside the hot dogs and savory toppings. Their loaded fresh fries were also amazing, too! Crispy fries and plenty of toppings to dip in.   Shout out to Dirt Dog and their staff for a tasty and memorable meal!",

    "text": "Went to the little module strip mall on the LV strip. It was a neat little cluster of shops, bars and fast eats. It reminded me of shops in Mexico, just more modern and they had workers outside trying to lure you in by, offering deals and specials. There was music blasting. So it felt up beat and party like. We came across this hot dog stand that looked great, so we stopped to look at the menu. We only tried one thing and it was the Elote dog. Delicious! A grilled all beef dog, wrapped in bacon topped with a citrus, mayo based sauce, grilled corn, cotija cheese, bits of chorizo and cilantro on a soft, lobster roll like bun, that had been crisped up on the sides with butter. It was so satisfying! It had all the elements, that balanced out every bite and was just enough for a snack to share. It is outdoors and it was freezing that day. You have to find a spot to eat, which is bummer but the bars allow you to eat inside... if you buy a drink. This isn't the easiest to thing to eat and you are going to want to scoop up every, single, delicious bite. The service was good.  If you don't want to stand and wait, the workers will track you down in the strip mall and deliver your food to the shops or bars in the mini mall. This worked for us, since we decided to enjoy a beer at sin city brewery while we waited but please shoot them a tip! If you are in the area, you should test this out. Lots more on the menu that we will be back to try on our next visit.",

This was that place that ended super negatively. A slap on any ones hot face. it's Vegas, 1 pm ish. Dirt dog is right down stairs from Bally's. I'm from LA so I know all about this place. And ive been to this location a few times in my previous trips.   I took a step out downstairs to order food, girl that was taking orders, all black clothing, bandana, short hair, light skinned, bigger than the other 2 girls, looked at me but didn't even greet me, say hello, here's our menu, if you have any questions let me know. NONE OF THAT. I said in my head ok fine I get it, it's like 107 degrees right now, you're next to a stove, cool beans I'll let that slide.  I looked at the menu, already knew what I wanted, I was just waiting for acknowledgement to order.... 4 min later.... \"you ready to order?\" in the most unprofessional tone. Kept my cool and said yeah I'll have the red dooo... cuts me off \"we don't got the mayo\"  uhhhh ok? You mean the aioli?  She does this shake on her head to what I assumed was a yeah.  So I said.... Ok I'll get the chili... no wait I'll get the elote...  Then she cuts me off again... \"like I said we don't got the mayo any thing with mayo we don't got\"  well then.... I'll just get the Chili cheese dog.... and as I was about to proceed to ordering more things because I was ordering for 3 other people she tells me... \"8.72\" or whatever price the total came up to. DUDE really? So I went along, paid my food and waited... the cook was probably the only decent person with customer service as she tried to serve me correctly and apologize for not having a bag for my to go order.   I'm all for good food but this girl needs a sit down with a manager or someone to straighten up the tone she brings into the establishment , she's utterly rude and has no sense of customer service. First impression of a business should always be acknowledgment especially to your customers.   The 1 Star is for that cook, blonde hair lady. You made it worth standing there to grab my food and walk away without saying a word back.",

On top was the Elote mixture which was over stuffed(not like I'm complaining). They did give me a fork and knife but to really enjoy it, you have to just pick it up(even if the topping falls down, it like an extra treat once you finish the dog). It's not something you should eat everyday but boy was it great treat for myself.",

She should've told me BEFORE I ordered that they were out of cream or at least be nicer and a little apologetic when telling me they didn't have it. On top of that, the batter somehow tasted really SOUR. Very peculiar and I'm not sure why, but that was the worst part. Maybe it was spoiled or perhaps something like pickles were dipped into the oil right before my batch? First time was 4 stars, second was zero stars so I settled with 2 stars total.",

They did a great job with this new pedestrian development with lots of great food, drinking and shopping options all in one place, and this place is kind of hidden off to the edge. I had a house and an elote dog and they were both great. I highly recommend this as a late night casual option instead of the pricier and less-good options inside the casinos.",

I ordered the elote dog and the elote fries. After placing my order and paying, an employee came out to let me know that there was only enough corn for one dish or the other. I chose to have the elote dog and changed my fries to chili fries (which I didn't end up liking). The pro is that the elote dog was fantastic. I would like to check out the location in Los Angeles to have the elote fries. With all of this being said, if I had known prior to paying that they didn't have enough corn, I would have chosen to eat elsewhere. It was one of those moods where you're really craving a certain thing... And when that craving isn't satisfied you are left annoyed and disappointed. I will give them another shot.",

The hot dog had a nice crisp outside. The toppings were to die for. I went with the hot Cheetos dog. Service was quick and I was super satisfied with the portion. We split one dog and an order of fries and were happy. I definitely could have split another dog though if I wanted to gorge myself. Next time I will get an elote too. Loved being able to have a gourmet dog at a reasonable price instead of having to eat fast food that I could get anywhere else. It is located down an alleyway on the way to Bally's. We found it while we were walking to the twilight zone mini golf inside Bally's. A nice day activity is stopping by to grab dogs for lunch, stop at the pub across the way for BOGO drinks, then going mini golfing.",

Their menu isn't really expensive for how great the food is and if you are a service member they do offer a discount for you!

But I found out they recently had two locations in Vegas. We went to the one at Bally's and immediately fell in love with the Chili Dog and the Elote dog. The one at Bally's is pretty small and kinda tricky to find, but not difficult, I just wish they had a bigger location out on the strip. But the next location I want to go to is on Rainbow Blvd., Mainly because it's an actually restaurant and big enough.",

So it just makes for an awesome hot dog. We got 3 hot dogs, 2 wings, and the fried Oreo and it was under $45. Dani, the lady who checked us out was super nice and helpful.",

I paid about $8 ish dollars for my meal. The hot dog was a decent sizing on this amazing bread bun with the proper amount of toppings. Very spicy and favorable. I ate pieces of fries from a friend's plate and they were quite tasty... but not tasty enough to pay $5 for them.  For those of you with sensitive stomachs and hard heads, please eat at your own discretion. It's amazing for drunk food or a quick bite to eat. Be mindful that is could possibly give you gas if not more. Lbvs",

    "text": "3.5 stars. This place had some big shoes to fill. We LOVE Dog Haus. Like best hot dogs ever. We were staying at Bally's so we couldn't pass up the chance to try a rival shop.   The menu on their site and the menu in person were slightly different, so it's worth doing some research first to know what they have to offer based on reviews. We went down a little after 11am when they were supposed to open at 10am and tried to order chili fries, but the chili wasn't ready yet (like not even close to being ready considering it was an hour after opening). We planned to try to come back and try the chili fries later, but it's Vegas, there are too many choices for food, so unfortunately we didn't get the chance.   My boyfriend got the flaming dog and I got the elote dog. I'm not a bacon fan (I know, I'm nuts - I don't mind bacon bits too much, just don't like soggy bacon strips), so I asked if they had a dog not wrapped in bacon and I was in luck. The lady taking the order asked if that meant I didn't want bacon bits either and I confirmed. When they brought out the dogs, the lady specifically said \"elote no bacon\" while setting down a dog smothered in bacon bits. Weird. My bf really liked the flaming dog. While I liked the corn, I just didn't love the combo of having it on a hot dog and wished I'd gotten it separate in a cup. I really loved the mayo on this one - I need to recreate it at home. I also liked that they served quality hot dogs on the buttered lobster-roll style buns.   Overall, my bf rates the place 4 stars and I'd hate to rob them of a star just because my personal tastes meant I didn't love the combo, but this place just doesn't match up to Dog Haus overall in terms of creativity and flavor for me.",

The bread was a bit soggy when I got home, wish I tried it fresh. Good amount of toppings and the and good idea of making an elote dog. The bun was more like toasted bread in a good way, liked it more than traditional hot dog buns, but overall the dog was way too salty for me. Took over 10 minutes for my order when I was the only customer at the time. I would come here again to try the hot dog fresh and give them another chance.",

They were great with no complaints. The only thing I would ask Dirt Dog is to put a fresh cucumber, pickle and tomatoes on the side. It helps with the richness of the hot dog.

I felt like it was plenty to fill me though. The selection of beverages was kinda basic. Good service, nice staff. It is right by WahlBurger (and just FYI, Dirt Dog was more satisfying to eat than WahlBurger) so if you have to choose one, I'd go for Dirt Dog. Also, the deep fried oreos are tasty, but I think that one is better worth it to just make at home instead of paying a lot.",

    "text": "The Dirt Dog was simply Marvelous! Stopped by to try this little Dive around 1am on a Saturday night... Not only did it completely satisfy all my cravings, but the presentation and deliciousness absolutely took me by surprise! I ordered the Patty Melt Dog with some Filthy Fries. The combinations of flavor on the palate from the Dog and fries mixture hit the spot! Absolutely Delicious. The hospitality for such a small place has the homemade family vibe with everything made and put together right before your very eyes a experience that's completely worth it! They offer you the Ol' Skool Coca Cola bottles to accompany the meal which to me was a total bonus. Also be advised that this establishment is very reasonably priced for the quality and portions they deliver. Definitely a 5 star rating and the quality of food and experience being a 10/10. Thanks",

    "text": "We had arrived late in Vegas and one of the places we wanted to eat at had ran out of their food so we looked up what was open at the time and this place was still open and near by. It is located on the strip with other small shops. It's more of a stand but there are tables near by to sit at. I am so happy that we have found this place.  I had ordered the Elote Dog. Yes, That's right I did say Elote as in the yummy mexican corn. When it came out, I wasn't sure on how to eat it or even start to pick it up to take a bite, or even if I should cut it into pieces first. The first bite...man it was so yummy that I just picked it up, regardless on how messy it can get and just kept eating.  So yummy, the bun is, I am not too sure but it seems like a buttermilk bun that was buttered on the outside and grilled to perfection. That housed a bacon wrapped polish like hotdog. With all the elote trimmings, from bacon bits, parmesean cheese, dash of tajin, sweet corn, cilantro, and they give you a slice of lime, and when you squeeze that lime on it...it just brings all that explosive flavors together. Best hot dog I ever had that I even came back the next day and ordered it again.  You can even get the elote in a small cup and it's very tastey. They have many variations on hot dogs that I didn't try but the Elote dog is the hot dog that will def bring me back again.",

    "text": "Very good hot dog quality with some slightly weird flavor profile decisions.   I ordered both the Elote and the House dog. I felt both were slightly odd flavor/texture choices. However, the bun was \"lobster roll\" style, which I guess just means it was buttered. This was quite decadent, in its savoriness.   The hot dog is large and of high quality. It tastes of pure beef and fat. It holds a solid bite.   The Elote dog is covered with corn, parmesan cheese, and some endless panoply of other toppings.   My advice would be to stick to the most basic dog you can find here. The toppings just sort of distracted from the nice hot dog.",

The place is very small with limited seating outside. Everything on the menu sounded interesting. Wanted to order a dirty chili dog but the chili wasn't ready yet. I ended up with a green dog and my wife ordered a red dog. We also got a side of elote fries. Everything was delicious. I must say, it was probably the best hot dogs I've EVER had.   Came back a second time before we left to try my dirty chili dog and my wife got the house dog. My chili dog was also delicious and one of the top chili dogs I've had but I enjoyed the green dog and my wife's red dog from the visit before more. I wasn't a huge fan of the house dog but it was still good. Luckily we ordered a mutt dog to share that was half red and half green for the last taste in my mouth.   This will be my go to place for good cheap street food along side with Tacos El Gordo depending on what side of the strip in at.",

Because we can make them as hot as your want. I was up for the challenge and said yea make me the hottest you can. Was I glad I did, they might have been some of the hottest but most delicious wings ever. All with a on the spot sauce. If you want some heat, don't hesitate to ask for something different. By the end of the night my mouth was on fire but I love heat so it was well worth it, by far hotter then BWW or Wingstop and 10x more flavorful.

Has some outdoor seating nearby, whether its specifically for Dirt Dog I'm not 100% sure.  The Hot Dogs were plump and juicy, the buttered bread was cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the spicy option on day one then last night I had the number one with the peppers and onions.  Both were excellent although i'll give the nod to the spicy dog.  Didn't try anything but the two dogs.   The ok:  Communication between staff was good on Tuesday, Wednesday needed some work. When i went on Tuesday there was no line so ordering was easy, pickup was easy etc. Wednesday night was a little different as there was several orders in front of me and it seemed like the staff had no clue who ordered what even though you provided them your first name for the order. There were more people working as well which could've added to the confusion as it such a small space.   All in all I had a great experience. It's making me hungry just thinking about it... I may go back a third time before my flight home. If I'm back next year for our annual conference I'll definitely make my way over to try another option.",

More detailed version:  $9 hot dog is pricey but it's gourmet I guess and on the strip, so the price reflects that. Bun was buttery and toasted, aka delicious. The elotes were flavorful and the dog as a whole was filling. I kind of viewed it as paying $9 for a premium hot dog with a side (the elotes) on top.   My wait time wasn't bad at all, only had to wait 5 min (on a Monday early evening). People have mentioned the long wait, and I'd say if you see a long line might be worth revisiting at a more convenient time.   Unclear why it's called Dirt Dog...  I give this place a thumbs up. Try for yourself, especially if there isn't much of a line.",

    "text": "One of my friends heard there was a Dirt Dog in Vegas and it was all he could suggest during our trip there. Finally after an extremely late night, promising him Dirt Dog was the only way we could get him out of bed and outside into the sunlight. He went directly for the Elote Dog and deep fried oreos. Honestly after the several years I've known him, I've never seen him this happy before.  I went with the Elote Dog and shared half of it with another friend who ordered the Dirty Chili Dog. I loved the chili on her hot dog, but I'll have to say the Elote Dog is pretty unique. The people working here were also amazing and we pretty much had a dance battle while they prepared our food. I wouldn't mind coming back here next time I need my hot dog fix in Vegas.",

They have a tiny space in the Grand Bazaar Shops. You might have to search a bit, but it's well worth it.  Let me just say: Lobster rolls and hot dogs together just makes sense. A rich bun and a salty dog? Yes please.  The Elote Dog was nice and bright, but the Dirty Chili Dog was the king of the meal. The Dirty Fries were nice and crispy as advertised and the Dirty Corn was a nice twist on the traditional elote. We knew their Deep-fried Oreos wouldn't disappoint either.  I can't give a perfect score since my order was completely skipped, but I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The prices, not bad. The service is friendly and the food is amazing. They have a great variety of hot dogs which are just tantalizing. We tried four different types and they were all fantastic.

It's on the east side of the strip, south of the Linq. When we arrived, there was only one guy working. It took awhile for the 6 of us to get our dogs because they are pretty complex hot dogs.  It was worth the wait. I ordered the red dog. It was the perfect level of spicy. The bacon wrapped dog was excellent. (They are all wrapped in bacon.) the bun was different, toasted, and freaking amazing. I also tried the elote, Mexican street corn. It was delicious, but super messy. I didn't see the photo of the corn in a cup until after I got corn all over my face. I would recommend asking for that if you want to stay cute.",

I don't even know where to begin. The bread alone tasted amazing. It was soft and it wasnt starchy. They do not cheat u with a small and cheap hotdog that's for sure. The toppings was just incredible. We went there twice. If I could go there again I would. My only suggestion.... do not share lol.",

WOW ! i can't lie. that shit was GOOD ! pretty much, i'm going back today to try a different dog and some fried oreos.   it's a little on the pricy side , but i'm sure it's due to location.... then again, they are gourmet hot dogs. they have hot dogs with fries on top, corn, avocado(you know everyone's crazy about avocados) , limes & they even have a bacon wrapped dog !!! who doesn't love bacon.  they also have the mexican corn with cojita cheese and everything !  fries and wings as well.  they do have fried oreos and twinkies but i haven't tried them yet but i will be soon.",

We bought $20 gin and tonics at an outdoor bar at Caesar's Palace, and consulted Yelp for an inexpensive lunch.  Dirt Dog is a hole in a wall among other small businesses, easy to find if you use Google Maps.    Low expectations, blown away by the food.  Doesn't matter what we had...  I'm confident you will be totally happy with your meal.  I actually thought about whether I could get a franchise back home.",

    "text": "I got the #DirtyChiliDog the first bite was outrageous. Loved this place from the start. Located at the Grand Bazaar shops out front of Bally's near the Las Vegas Strip. This place is a must try for tourists and locals. The bun is slightly toasted giving a unique flavor to the bread. The chili  is unreal and the cheese sauce drizzled with bacon bits and onion tastes amazing. Although there was not a whole lot of seating available the atmosphere surrounding the shops definitely draws you in. Glad I got a seat but if it were peak tourist season I could see many people wishing for a place to sit if you are in small groups you might have to share a table with strangers which is understandable and what I had to do. Taylor was very helpful and she knew the menu and made great suggestions pointing out several tasty items for a first time goer. Giving multiple options as a greeter is nice because it let me know \"You can't go wrong.\" She made me feel excited to try something new which seems to come naturally to her she just has an inviting personality. I will definitely be back for more. I valeted at Bally's they charge $15 for the first 4 hours David and Jimmy were really nice at the Valet booth and Blue was my driver and he was very polite. I asked to tip the valet guys through the credit card payment option and the valet guys told me this was not possible unfortunately I did not have cash on me. It may be helpful to add a tip option so that I and others could generously tip those that make the service so wonderful.",

I had the Mutt Dog which is hotter on one end(red) and not quite as hot on the other (green). It was loaded with all kinds of toppings and definitely filled me up. This is the best of street food! Dirt Dog found unique and flavorful ways of serving up this American favorite.If you're on the strip and hungry for hot dogs, pass up the others and give Dirt Dog a try!",

    "text": "Recently went to the location at the Grand Bazaar Shops after reading a positive review in local publication praising the specialy bacon wrapped hotdogs. There were a few people when we got there on a Fri late afternoon . Location is quite small so basically order at the counter and find open seats at tables located nearby. My guest ordered the 'red dawg' and they asked/offered to make a combo for addt'l fee - which included fries and a beverage - Coke is a cold glass bottle (no fountain options available - so no cups with ice). They were told to take a seat and they're bring to table - they got theirs pretty quick - I ordered the 'dirty chili dawg' - and made mine a combo - asked what options besides Coke was told Gatorade so I had that (it was cold). I was too told to take a seat and food would be brought out. You have to pay on a tablet (no register) I was not provided option to give email for receipt (the young man doing the order taking didn't seem too interested in offering or was very personable for that matter )(was suprised on cc statement was charged about $15 for hot dog, fries & small bottle Gatorade). Anyways so my guest is about 1/2 way thru with their meal before I get my hot dog and they dont' bring the fries. I have to go back - try to get the guy's attention that took my order (he's in tunnel vision mode) to get my fries (read previous comments about the order taker) - had to wait close to 8 mins or so as they had to make a new batch (after getting attention of the lady that brought out my hot dog btw). The fries were very greasy and didnt' give good amount (since they were so greasy didn't mind). Anyways - I don't expect 5 star service at a place like this but it could have been better. Too many other options to get a decent meal than this - wasn't worth it. Wouldn't recommend.",

It had a lot of flavor and the fries were cooked to perfection. There were lots of seats near the place and it was in a shaded area so wasn't too hot while we ate. The price were very reasonable and the food was amazing. Definitely would come back here.",

It was a regular hot dog and the cheese was gritty. They ran out of corn products so I couldn't order elote.   I would give them 2 starts but the extra star is for the 2 employees that were busting their asses with pushing out orders.  I just hyped myself up for regular deregular hot dogs.  Very disappointed.",

    "text": "While in Vegas, I got an alert that it was National Hot Dog Month, so I sat out to find a place to get hot dogs around 10pm on a Wednesday night.  This was second on the yelp search listing and a straight shot on the bus from my hotel, so I went with this location.  This is one of two locations in Vegas.   If you take the bus, get off at the Cesar Palace hotel, because the next stop is pass the Belliago and is about a six minute walk back to the Dirt Dog and you have to climb a staircase to cross a couple of bridges to get back on the correct side of the street.   I'd viewed the menu before leaving the hotel and although the hot dogs were too \"gourmet\" for me,  I was very interested in the garlic fries.  They are not sold at this location.  I went with fries with a chile and limon seasoning.  They were salty, but not inedible  There are no plain hot dogs offered, but they have 8 options with assorted toppings   I went with hot wings and ate maybe three of the five or six that came with the order.   I requested blue cheese and the lady told me I gave you ranch, I don't know if that meant blue cheese is not available, but I took the bag and headed back to the bus stop.  The fries held up well for the 12 minute bus ride back to the hotel, but the wings were cold and so heavily battered, they were impossible to enjoy.  Note to self, never get wings from a place with specialty hot dogs",

My friend highly recommended Dirt Dog and man, it was delicious! When we got there, the shop was re-prepping after receiving an $800 catering order. I was impressed that they were able to do it with their small kitchen. That order really should have gone to their rainbow location. Anyways, they were closed for a time period but because my friend and I were on a time crunch due to an hour lunch, Jaydee took care of us even though he was terribly busy. He gave us awesome service and would definitely be back, not only because of the hot dogs, but because of their service.   I highly recommend the elote dog or the flaming dog if you like hot Cheetos. They are super filling! Definitely try this place out!",

    "text": "I love the concept of this place - a hotdog centric menu with unapologetically \"bad-for-you\" creations. I believe I got the flaming dog on my last visit. Just too much going on in my opinion. Too many toppings just overpower what should be the star of the show--the hot dog. The hotdog bun was pretty unremarkable as well. Overall, too greasy, too many calories. And even though I'm a carnivore, I don't remember seeing any vegetarian or vegan options. I'm sure they can come up with something creative for that clientele. I think that would certainly raise their game. Other negatives: this place is basically a hole in the wall without much seating. When I went there last time, the nearby tables were absolutely filthy. No one had bothered to buss them. Just not a great customer service experience either. But I do like their swag. A few improvements here and there, and I think they can really improve their rep.",

I even smiled at one of the girls and she just turned around. Once they finally felt like taking our order we weren't told \"what can I get for you\" or anything. I felt like the girl was cutting me off or in a rush I'm not sure what her deal was but we were told \"stand to the side and wait for your order\". I tried not to be rude back because I get it you're busy and maybe you're not having a good day. However, it's not okay to be that way with customers who have heard so much and have been excited about the spot only to be treated that way. I know you guys have business guaranteed and this review may not matter but it could be 01828842 times better if the girls just fixed their attitude.",

Worth a try if you've never had foie gras on a hot dog, but they have room to improve - especially for the price.",

Best thing on menu was the \"elotes\" fries with corn and lime and sauce and cheese on them.

I ordered the House Dog and the Dirty Chili Dog. Katie ordered the Patti Melt Dog. These hotdogs were as gourmet as you can dress a dog. The buns were made from Texas toast. All the hotdogs get wrapped with bacon. Now I remind you we got these Hotdogs at night when this place was closing. Usually when it's later in the day or better yet your last orders you wouldn't expect things to taste all that fresh or good. But Kenny and his staff must love what they do. I honestly felt like the hotdog couldn't have been made any better. Kenny also was kind and generous and gave Kate and I dessert. This place wowed me, who knew you could make the hotdog this special.   The House Dog: The hotdog is wrapped in bacon and has Thousand island and green chili spread. It's a heavy hotdog with tons of flavor. Honestly a little too much flavor for myself. It tastes good but was not my favorite from the ones I picked.   The Dirty Dog: is every mans dream hotdog!! The classic chili cheese dog gourmet styled. I haven't tasted a good chili dog like that since I was a kid. This hotdog far exceeds the one I had as a kid to be honest. I wish I lived in Vegas just for this damn hotdog.   The Patti Melt Dog: this hotdog came loaded with cheese and bacon and French fries. It also has an aioli spread that ties in perfect.   Katie said she wished she got one for the plane ride back home.   Honestly wish the best for this establishment and hope they continue to succeed.",

The prices are decent for the amount of food you will be getting.   We ordered the original dirt dog, the mutt dog, and elotes in a cup. All the hotdogs comes wrapped with bacon, which is the best thing that could ever happen to hotdogs! The buns they use are the England buns usually found with lobster rolls. It is perfectly buttered and toasted with a crunch on the outside and soft, warmth on the inside.  The original dog is pretty much the basics of what would be in a hot dog (mustard, ketchup) with sauteed onions and green peppers.  The mutt dog is a mix between the red dog and green dog, and boy is it spicy! Be prepared to have your mouth set on fire.  The elotes were pretty good, it could have a bit too much of cheese, but all the right spices are there.   I definitely would recommend this to all my friends and we are going to be returning here anytime we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "When I heard there was a place called Dirt Dog in Vegas, all I could think about was bacon-wrapped hot dogs smothered in onions. That's what dirty dogs usually are to me. However, I was pleasantly surprised when Dirt Dog offered so many other toppings besides onions. They have ones with chili, ones with spicy sauce, melted cheese, guacamole, chimichurri and even hot cheetos.   $8 for a hot dog might seem like you're paying a lot, but the hot dogs are quite large and come smothered with toppings. Their buns are also not your typical hot dog buns. More like thick cuts of bread sliced in half, perfectly toasted and fragrant. MMM. I ordered the Green Dog, which came with Chimichurri Sauce and Guacamole Spread and I absolutely loved it.   Another thing that I was so excited for was the dirty corn they had on their menu. I would love to eat corn on a cob, but it's messy and gets everywhere, not good if you're walking around the strip. If you prefer to enjoy corn and stay clean, opt for the Dirty Esquite Corn in a Cup for $5. It's elote in cup form with lime, mayo, chili powder, cotjia cheese, cilantro and bacon bits. I would prefer if they added Tapatio for the spicy kick and more lime. Then it would've been perfecttttt.   I usually don't hang out in this part of Vegas, but now I feel like I have to come back to Dirt Dog again. They have so many other goodies on their menu, it's the perfect spot to get a quick bite if you're on the go. I highly recommend Dirt Dog if you're looking for a nice snack and don't feel like paying too much.",

I mean I wouldn't even consider myself a huge hot dog fan, but the way they dress up this classic and ordinary American food with asian and Mexican influences is incredible. My personal favorites are their signature one and the elote one.   AND DONT YOU DARE LEAVE WITHOUT TRYING THE FLAMING HOT CHEETOS CORN. Crying rn just thinking about how much I've missed it. If they could somehow expand and come to the Midwest they would be a huge hit. We LOVE our hot dogs.   Give this place a definite visit while you're in Vegas.

We stayed at Bally's so dirt dog was just a short walk away. We came across this location by mere chance and were captivated by the selection of interesting menu items. On separate occasions (during the same trip), I tried an elote dog and a hot cheetos dog here which were both absolutely delicious (I love elotes and hot cheetos)! Further, I was able to try deep fried oreos and deep fried twinkies for the first time. The oreos were everything - if you haven't tried, you absolutely have to! The prices weren't terribly high (considering it's Las Vegas) and the food was worth every penny. If you are in Vegas - you absolutely have to try dirt dog!",

We asked the cook if they take Apple Pay and she just kindly said no. We had no choice but to bust out the credit card that was either a hit or miss due to security when traveling far. When we ordered the card was declined. We were upset that everything was going wrong the entire day so we apologized and walked back to our hotel to see if there are other places that will take Apple Pay. My boyfriend and I sat down for a minute to call the bank to see why our card was declined. The girl from dirty dog went to hunt us down with the food we ordered in her hand. She said she had already started on our order and she was going to give it to someone else if we didn't want the food. We thanked the girl (didn't get her name) for being so kind to us and took her offer.   The hot dogs though! They were the best hot dogs that we have ever had. Very flavorful and delicious! I planned on going back to the hotel, get some cash and walk back to give her a nice tip for her kind gesture. By the time we got to the hotel my feet was already in so much pain from all the walking. I feel bad I didn't get to do what I wanted by going back to dirt dog. If you are the owner and reading this, please reach out to me so we can discuss how I can repay you for such a nice gesture that made our bad day better.",

Here's a photo of my food and you can see the oil on the side. I was so excited to try it but was very disappointed at the end of my meal. Definitely not a returning customer.",

We all wanted to try their elote dog and the elote in a cup but since they were closing soon they said they didnt have enough corn for all three of us and that the only corn they had was on the cobb. But luckily the guy making our food was nice enough to cut the corn off the cob for us!! (Yes we tipped him fat for this) lol.   I ended up getting the Flaming Elote dog and the DUI fries, which i didnt see on the menu but the worker recommended it since it was my first time!   The hotdog was SO GOOD! Had an explosion of flavors! Corn, hot cheetos, and an aioli sauce on the hot dog all coming together in a nice toasty soft bread. Got a little salty towards the end but still good.   The fries were also delicious AF! Highly recommend trying it out. The fries were perfectly crispy and were so fresh. They were covered in pastrami, carne asada, cheese, and a chipotle sauce. Sooooooo amazing!!!   All the employees were dope and chill! Loved the vibez here! Will come back again when i visit.",

What caught my attention was that they serve Elotes on a stick called Dirty Corn, which comes with one corn on the cob, lime, mayo, chili powder, cojita, cilantro and bacon bits. I got the Dirty Esquire which is the same thing but in a cup. I asked for no bacon because I wanted to enjoy the flavors of the corn with the cojita and lime/mayo.   I gotta say, it is the best elotes I've ever tried. My mouth is literally getting watery from just thinking about it. It was delicious!!! I will need to come back to try their hot dogs next time I'm in the area. Hopefully soon!",

The first was a House Dog with Bacon Thousand Island and Green Chile Spread while the second was a Red Dog with everything plus a perfectly-spicy Ghost Pepper Sauce. Be sure to check out all the extra sauces Dirt Dog has because your mouth will thank you. Also, just go ahead and get the Dirty Corn Elote loaded with Mexican Crema, Cotija Cheese, Cilantro, Bacon Bits, and Chili Powder. Don't be coy. You know you want to jam it down your throat, too.  The whole encounter was brief, but memorable at Dirt Dog in the Grand Bazaar Shops (in front of Bally's). I have no idea the guy's name working there, but I'll never forget his positive attitude or the hot dog-stuffed buns he gave me for my first time at Dirt Dog.",

Awesome juicy bacon-wrapped hot dog in a fluffy buttery lobster roll bun. I thought the bun would be too bready for the hot dog but the dog was huge and filled it in with the toppings easily.   They were incredibly slow when I ordered it for Saturday 12pm lunch time. I waited for 20 minutes to get mine. They only have limited space to cook so if you miss the cutoff, your wait is significantly longer. This happened to my friends who ordered right after me and they had to wait an additional 10-15 minutes more.",

The place is located right in front of Bally's near this little area with different food stalls and mini shops. It is kinda hidden in the back so look carefully! My family ordered the dirty dog, elote dog, and the  dirty corn on a  stick. All of them were heaven in each bite. So buttery and flavorful. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were at the Jockey club. I was looking for a Good hotdog on Yelp.Dirt Dog came up. In front of Bally's. It was after 6pm. It says closes at Midnight so I felt like we had ample time. We set out on our Vegas Journey. It was a little tricky to find because there's many rows connected to the eatery center. The nice lady at Ben & Jerry's sent us in the right direction.  At the Dirt Dog Food Kiosk we meet a local Hawaiian Randy. She was from Aiea, our island of Oahu. So I felt right at home.  Aundrea took our order. I want to say he is the owner. John ordered the Pastrami Dog. $10 Pastrami, pickles, cheese, mustard, bacon bits, sweet peppers & aioli sauce.  I ordered the patty melt dog no bun no chipotle aioli sauce. $8.95 Only fries, bacon and cheddar. We got a side of the fried Oreos. $4 I've read where people complain of no seating but it was actually very open. There were tables available and we received Table Service from Aundrea. He brought our food out.  It looked mouthwatering good. Cheddar cheese smothered over fries and a juicy hotdog. I was in heaven. I took a mouthful and realized it had the chipotle Aioli sauce. Just as Aundrea was walking up to check on us. As I was chugging the water. He was apologetic. Remade my food and gave me another bottle water. How could I complain. The service was really good. The food was just as good. Prices are reasonable. What more can you ask for. See you soon.",

I got the elote dog and the toppings were interesting. But the dog itself is just so greasy! Like I think a dog has more flavor if it's just lightly cooked but these ones tasted fried or drenched in oil and then cooked. I love good junk food but this is a miss for me. I don't consider this good or memorable food. I'm only giving it three stars because the toppings were good. It was like eating great toppings with a deep fried McDonalds patty. I'm sorry, it's either just not for me or dogs aren't my thing.",

The staff is super friendly. Seating is limited to about four tables next to their stand in the corridor. I waited for a table to open up and my order was brought out by the staff.  I ordered the House Dog. They added just the right amount of condiments so it wasn't overpowering. The bun is grilled and super soft. I also ordered the Elote and it was so juicy every time I took a bite the juices sprayed all over the place. The seasoning was also just right. The Fried Twinkie was ok and came with a whipped frosting on the side which enhanced the flavor. Towards the end I was laboring to finish it all.  If you're ever visiting Las Vegas and don't live in LA I definitely recommend grabbing a bite to eat here! Time for a siesta...",

It's on the right hand side in one of the alleyways, if you're coming from the strip. There was no line when we got here. We ordered the mutt dog and an elote corn to share. I wouldn't say these are bacon wrapped, but the fine print does say \"bacon bits\". I didn't like the bacon bits as they tasted a bit stale and took away from the rest of the flavors. The mutt was really good though! The red half was a little too spicy for me, and it was 90+ degrees outside. The elote corn wasn't too amazing, but it was tasty as well.  The star of the meal was actually the hot dog bun! It tasted super buttery and super soft.   Prices are much cheaper than other places on the strip, so if you're in need of a quick cheap meal, stop here!",

    "text": "I have tried their original location in Los Angeles, CA already and have raved about it to my friends and family. So when I found out that there was a location on the Las Vegas Strip, I told my friends that we had to come here for lunch!  FOOD: I got the Elote dog again because I just can't get enough of it! I love how they are so generous with the cotija cheese, corn and to top it off with cilantro and lime. YUMMMM. My mouth is just watering while writing this. I also tried their Flaming Dog, which isn't much different than their Elote Dog since they just add the spiciness and Hot Cheeto crumbs, but sure is delicious as well. Their Filthy Fries was good, but I thought it was a bit too heavy for me after scarfing down their hot dogs. I suggest you share the fries with your friends/family when you decide to try this place at. They don't offer free water like their LA location, maybe because it's Vegas?  VENUE: The store is located on your right if you're heading toward the Cromwell hotel from Planet Hollywood and it is down an alley. Unfortunately, there are many tables, chairs and shade for diners. I had to scope out for people who are done eating so I can steal their place after. Ahaha  PARKING: There isn't a parking lot. It is Vegas. You will have to park at the hotel parking structures or UBER/LYFT if you don't have a car. If you don't mind the walk and need to park your car somewhere, park at Planet Hollywood because that is the hotel closest to Dirt Dog that doesn't charge for parking.   SERVICE: There isn't much of a service besides them making and bringing the food to you, but they sure are quick!",

I just needed a little snack so I settled on an order of elote fries to share.  I wish I was hungry enough to get a hot dog, but I thought that would've been too much at the time.  I didn't really need the fries either (although they were really crispy and good!).  The grilled corn, with all of its toppings, was delicious.

Dirty Fries - Good crunchy fries. I got the spicy ketchup, but didn't seem spicy.  Small shop. There are tables outside a few shops down. They will bring your food to you or you can takeout.  If you like specialty dogs, give them a try. I will be back next time if I'm around.",

The lobster roll was soft and yummy i feel like it was maybe brushed with butter and lightly toasted idk but it was effing amazing. The dog itself was hot and juicy and not soggy. When you bite into it it, it \"popped\" not like collapsed...you know what i mean when you get a crappy hot dog.   Anyway...this place lived up to the yelp review hype and definitely a must stop when you are in the area or want a good dog!!",

Thoroughly impressive that the quality of flavor they pack in the food comes out of a store the size of a bedroom.  I ordered the Elote Dog($8.95) and the Elote Fries($7.50). The hot dog was incredible, the Lime Mayo and Cotija were an amazing compliment to each other. The hot dog was hot and juicy, it had a great casing and nice pop(!!)  The fries had the same benefits and they were beautifully crispy and made to order. There was no question of freshness and the you can watch the crew crank out the plates right in front of you.  Worth a stop no doubt",

Gotta love the bacon!  The soft, buttery bun was a french roll.    There are a few tables and chairs where you can eat along the side of the aisle.  I can imagine this place to be super busy in the afternoon.  As a local to LA, how ironic that my first time at Dirt Dog was in Vegas!  I'll be sure to try their original location.",

We all loved it. Looking back, we all wondered \"hmm was it good because we were just really drunk?\" Well, let me tell you, that was not the case. I just went back to Vegas and had 6 dirt dogs in 3 days. They were absolutely delicious. My favorites were the dirty chili dog and the green dog. In addition to the amazing food, the staff was amazing. Special shout out to Victor who took care of me several times. His service was top notch. Give that man a raise! Have you ever looked at a hot dog the same way you look at your kid when you're proud of them? I have. Thank you, Dirt Dog. #DirtDogForLife",

She took the time to explain to us what was in each since it wasn't 100% clear. There are only a few tables about 10 steps away, and i can see it being way too busy to find a spot in the summer.  However, despite the fact that these are hot dogs, they are NOT easy to eat standing up/walking. You need the tray under you and a fork to finish the toppings that have fallen off.  Between three of us, we got 2 cups of corn and 3 dogs (mutt, elote, and pastrami?) All were very good. The mutt dog was a little spicer than I expected, so know that their spicy is actually reasonably spicy!  I didn't try an elote cup, but it looked delicious and both of my friends really enjoyed it. The dogs are definitely filling, so I suggest sharing if you get more than one item for yourself.  This little shop is about to get REKT in the summer. Promise there'll be a line in the sweltering heat!",

Warning:  the place is outdoors - so if the temp is extreme, you're gonna feel it.  My friend ordered a chili dog and an elote dog.  Both of the dogs were solid.  The franks had pop, the toppings were great, and the bread complimented the dog (that is if you're into gourmet dogs.)  My only gripe is the limited drink selection and lack of heat -- it was a cold night.  Then again, there are plenty of places near by to sit where it's warm and where you can grab your drink of choice.  My friend that drank a bit much recommends this place even if the cold temp killed the buzz.",

The owner (I think?) came out and was chatty and told us a little about the business' story, being inspired by the street food of LA.   Our food came out, and it was initially wrong - 2 elote dogs - but the owner quickly brought us out the chili dog and let us keep the other elote dog. Great service!

I went for the patty melt, wife got the House Dog. We also ordered the Dirty Esquite and Dirty Fries. Both hot dogs were just amazing. The \"bun\" they use is one of the best pieces of bread I've ever eaten. The fries are killer, especially with the spicy ketchup. The esquite was so freaking good. As soon as we walked up, the guy taking orders offered us a menu and was pleasant to be around during the transaction and delivery of our order. Will be back!",

Then only two people working with a good size line they kept it fun and didn't seem they needed to rush in orders so they can get them all done. It was done within a timely manner.  I decided to go with the #EloteDog! OMG this dog is a burst of flavor at first bite. It was filled with fresh ingredients and she wasn't shy on the toppings either. Very filling in my opinion.

We got the elote, Buffalo wings, and three hot dogs. I got the \"mutt\" dog which was half red and half green - loved the green half so much I went back and got another one. The bread was buttery and perfect. Everything was great. The two guys working were super friendly, remembered our faces and brought us our food down the way. Highly recommend!",

She tried to argue with me that the price was the same when if you go on the website the prices of these same items I got are cheaper. Then on top of that you gotta pay $9 for parking alonComing from a Vegas local, if you can go to the rainbow location. Much better!",

We waited about 15-20 min for the food but we were kindly forewarned when we order as a big group had order right before us. The wait was definitely worth it. Everyone enjoyed their meal.   My husband and I had the elote fries, dirty filthy fries, green dog and elote. We paid under $30 including tax and a tip, great value considering this is located on the strip. The fries are like a meal, not a side, and very filling. Every bite was delicious.   This place also sells deep fried Oreos and Twinkies. I was too full after my meal to order more food but planning on going back!",

Been wanting to check out their LA location for a while now so I was pleasantly surprised to see that they opened a small stand type location here in Vegas. The menu offers unique hotdogs and sides. We opted for the Red Dog, the Mutt Dog, the Dirty Chili Cheese Dog, elote corn in a cup and chili cheese fries. The highlights were the Red Dog and the elote. The Red Dog ended up being my favorite because it had the most flavor and it was super tomatoey and spicy. The Mutt Dog to me was a brighter  -milder version of the Red. The Chili Cheese Dog was good but lacked flavor compared to the other two. As for the sides, the elote was clearly better than the chili cheese fries. The place was busy and the food was made in a timely manor considering there were only too employees working in a little stall. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Friendly, quick, and honest service. My bf and I got the House dog, the dirty chili dog, and a small cup of elote. Good price, especially for Vegas. Will definitely be back!",

The shop is conveniently located in a open face shopping (mostly food) court. Menu is pretty simple to order from. We had the Chill one and Dirt Dog. We loved the Dirt Dog more because the special corn added there. Both dogs are a little too salty, but it is good in Vegas because that make you drink more water! The workers there are so nice, especially a boy who helped us. Definitely recommend if you walk by this area, or want a quick bite before watching Bellagio fountain show!",

I got the elote dog (sorry if I misspelled) and it was loaded with corn, had some bacon bits, and sprinkled with chili and cilantro. The bun was toasted and flakey and is not my favorite hot dog bun! I also tried the elote fries and it was great too! The fries were super crisp and crunchy! And it doesn't get soggy fast either. You need to try Dirt Dog when u come to Vegas!  *Update 3/22/19 I meant to say \"and is NOW my favorite hotdog bun!\" I got autocorrected. I'm sorry for the confusion!  Keep doing what you're doing because it's great! It was a great meal for my last day in Vegas!",

I've never actually had elote but I didn't really like the fries. It had too much mayonnaise in it, but the quality of the fries themselves were good. I was starving but when I ordered both, I was feeling full before my food even came out. I knew it was going to be heavy and overwhelming, so I ended up throwing most of this away. It wasn't horrible though, but I would probably try something else next time.  Thankfully, the chili cheese dog wasn't too overwhelming. They use a buttered bread roll and it looks like it's a lobster roll basically, so that was really yummy.   Overall, I think i'd definitely come back so I can try other things, but this has joined my list of must haves when visiting Vegas.",

I really wish I could've tried half the elote dog, but I know I'm asking too much there (I actually came back the next day to try the elote dog, but they were out, so I just got another mutt dog, which I was also ok with.) I definitely wouldn't recommend getting a dog to eat anywhere but right here, right after you get it, or it'd probably get soggy and fall apart. (Extra bonus of eating it here: there's a great brewery tasting room literally right next, so you can sit there, eat your food, and also have a great beer! To my knowledge, they have nothing to do with each, it's just a happy coincidence.)  My wife is a huge fan of chili cheese fries, so she got those, and that is an even more ludicrous amount of food, for only $6.25 - good price anywhere, but crazy good for the strip. The fries themselves were nothing out of the ordinary, they were just decent fries, but the whole thing put together was... not the best chili cheese fries I've had, but probably the best chili cheese fries I've had for that cheap for that much food (and also pretty good).   Another extra bonus, they're open super late, and this is pretty much *the* perfect food to eat after drinking all day and night in Vegas. (But it's pretty good even while sober, too.)",

    "text": "Unique and tasty hot dogs! Got the elote dog which is basically a hot dog dressed up like Mexican street corn. And it's bomb! The bun is not your average run-of-the-mill grocery store bun.  It's the bread you typically get with a lobster roll, whichever bread that is but it definitely makes a huge difference in taste as it's grilled on each side til it's nicely toasted then filled with the hot dog and overflowing with toppings. They're a small place with no seating but you can always take your hot dog and walk the strip. I'm not a big hot dog fan as it's not my first choice when selecting good food to eat but this place does it uniquely different and I'll be back next time to try one of their other dogs.",

There are outdoor seatings outside if you choose to eat there.  [Food] I ordered the House Dog and the Red Dog. I thought I could eat two but they were actually quite bigger than I expected( I finished both of them anyway). The sausage was juicy and tasty but did not have the strong snap, if you know what I mean. They were very saucy, which you can already tell by the name of this place.  [Price&Service] The service was good. The workers were really friendly even when they were busy. I thought it was quite pricey but it was about average comparing to other restaurants around there.",

The menu is easy to understand, and the person who took our order gave a few recommendations as well. If you're on the Strip walking around in your in the area of this hidden spot, definitely drop in and grab a hot dog.",

I had the Elote Dog, and Elote fries, which both were good. The Elote Dog really fills you up because I couldn't finish the fries I ordered. The staff was very friendly and patient. They really do not push you to go eat with them. The staff brought our food out to the table my sister and I were sitting even though I stood nearby to pick up the food. They didn't once made a big deal when I insisted that I could take the food to the table. The young man working there didn't mind taking it to our table. When I couldn't finish my fries, I went back to ask for a bag. He already knew that I needed a bag and just handed one. I wished I gotten his name to give him kudos for going above and beyond.",

It came with a roasted jalapeno and after about the 3rd bite of that jalapeno, the heat kicked in real good. My eyes started watering and I started sweating. My glasses started fogging up and I couldn't see, but I was determined. I ripped off my glasses and I started to get my second wind. I was half-way into that dog and although that jalapeno was so good, I didn't go back to it. I finished that dog and dirty corn up no problem. You're gonna need plenty of napkins because it's a hands on kinda thing and like the sign says \"dirty\". It gets messy but it's all good!",

I came prepared to judge, but this place surpassed my expectations. These dogs are the best, we tried the house dog and the half and half dog. Along with the ktown wings and the elote fries I swear I've never had food like this. The chef is amazing and personally came out to hand us our food when the wait became a little too long for our last dog. The service is great, the food amazing - I'll definitely be driving up to LA to stop at their restaurant once I'm back home in SD. The chef said their next shop will be opening in Orange County but I'll keep my fingers crossed for a San Diego shop!!",

I loved it but it definitely has a kick that I wish he would've told us about. My lips are still tingling a bit from the heat. Service was spectacular!  Super friendly and helpful!",
