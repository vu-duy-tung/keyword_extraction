Couple of hours after we ate there, my son got sick. It's been 24 hours and we're sitting at the emergency room with him. The food was horrible. The only reason we stayed and ate is because I worked all day without having the time to take lunch, I was hungry and exhausted to just get up and leave. The worst possible experience. I will never go to this place again. And I will be calling a health department to complain.",

Open until 5am, live music during early dining hours to set the tone, half off pizzas after midnight, friendly informative service from Stephan(I hope I spelt this correct), and to top it amazing food that really has that \"grandmas recipe\" taste. We started with fresh bread , garlic butter. Sold! Lobster ravioli and shrimp scampi... I cleaned both plates with my second basket of bread. I had the steak flambe (NY strip) with a peppercorn sauce that was just right to not take away from the steak. Sauteed broccoli, twice baked potato, and roasted peppers. He had the chicken parmigiana with and extra side of that amazing marinara sauce. Both dishes clean and cleared. Just bummed we didn't save room for dessert. Next Monday cannoli here we come! Also on Mondays they have half off wine bottles!",

    "text": "Probably the best hometown Italian restaurant I've ever had! (And it's in Vegas!!!)  When you first find the place, it's sandwiched between a Dutch Bro's coffee house and a gun shop/range (very quaint location). Then when you walk in, you are transformed back in time, probably in New York around the 1960s or 1970s. A time where live music was happening, and the service was very personable.   I went there with my boyfriend and his stepmom. We arrived around 6:30 pm or so and was seated immediately. Our waiter did some small talk with us, then got our drink order. I couldn't decide what to order so I did some more chatting with the waiter and asked for his recommendations.   My bf stepmom ordered the Shrimp Scampi which she enjoyed very much. My boyfriend ordered their famous Baked Lasagna which was really delicious. The plus side of ordering the lasagna was that they gave more meat marinara sauce if you wanted more of it. (So all you meat marinara lovers have at it!) As for me, I got the Linguine Luciano which was so delicious! Their portion was huge! and I wanted to finish every bite of it but didn't have enough room in my stomach for it. I guess I shouldn't have gotten a cup of their Grandma's Famous Chicken Soup prior to my meal. However the soup was so good how could you not want to finish that???  Since it was my boyfriend's birthday weekend, the band played Happy Birthday for him and we got a Cannoli! Which was really good!   Overall experience: service, setting, and food... 5 stars!!! Totally will come back when I'm in Vegas and recommend anyone to come and eat there. Oh yeah... if you happen to be in town and you wanted to get to this place but don't have a car or don't want to drive. You could make a reservation prior to your visit and get complimentary limo service from them. (Something to think about.)  Happy Eating Everybody!",

The lamb on the bed of risotto tasted like dirt. The chicken francaise (sp)? tasted like the entire bottle of salt was dumped on it. And the water...I think the ditch water might have tasted better. The entertainment director told us to tell our waiter it was our sons birthday bc they do a little something special...aaaaaannnddd nothing. Needless to say our waiter can kick rocks and he didn't get tipped. The entertainment and our two runner guys got the tip. Thanks guys. We won't be back...ever.",

The service was impeccable, items were cleared from the table within seconds of being done, wine glasses were never less that half full- our server, Tony, was very attentive and made excellent recommendations.

    "text": "Hubby & I came to Vegas to meet my family and I really wanted to take them out to a nice family dinner.  My mom, sister, hubby and I really LOVE pasta.  This cute little place was highly ranked among the rest.  It's located in a neighborhood a few minutes away from the strip.  My first impression of the restaurant was that it was very charming and the fact that it was away from the strip was great because it was a small venue but they were still able to accommodate is with no reservation.  The wait time was less than three minutes and everyone from the hostess, to the waiter, to the live band was amazing.  Everyone asked where we were from and they loved the fact that we were representing Hawaii.  The band even played a special song for us to help bring a little island comfort to the scene.  I ordered the Pasta Alla Forno which is penne pasta tossed with chicken, shrimp, broccoli and mushrooms in a light pink sauce baked in the oven with fresh mozzarella, this dish was very delicious.  It's something that the waiter and I have never seen in any Italian Restaurant, I finished the entire plate! My hubby had his all time favorite, the Chicken Parmigiana.  He thought it was descent but felt it wasn't up to par with the other versions he's had.  He honestly felt that Olive Garden mastered that fish better than this place... My little sister had the Spaghetti with Meatballs.  It was amazing! The meatballs were so soft and juicy.  Both the Chicken Parmigiana and Spaghetti with Meatballs were both one pound plates! The two couldn't finish it... lol.  My mom had the Linguini & Clams which was fresh clams, both chopped and whole in your choice of either a red or white sauce over linguini.  She enjoyed this dish as well with no complaints.  My dad got one of the Specials that they were featuring that night, a Trio Sampler which had the Lobster Ravioli (GREAT dish), Shrimp (It was okay), and the Gnocchi which was homemade potato dumplings served with your choice of meat sauce (he ate every bite).  For dessert I had one cannoli, which was the first cannoli I've ever had in my life! IT WAS DELICIOUS! It even comes with a free shirt :)   All in all I have to say I would give this place five stars but because not everyone enjoyed there food as much as I did, I gave the overall venue four stars.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone that LOVES PASTA and isn't afraid to try something new.  I love trying different things and if you're one, this place is a MUST GO TO!!!",

    "text": "This is quintessential old Las Vegas!  It is an off strip location in a fantastic brick building (brick in Nevada-just sayin').  My favorite part of the experience, place a reservation in advance for free limo service! Whaaat?!  Does this place know their audience or what?!  How smart is that marketing?!  I adored it.  It was not fancy, it wasn't run down, it was perfect for celebrating and enjoying with loved ones.  There are lots of pictures and Godfather references throughout the restaurant.  I love the kitsch of the decor, it works.    Their wine menu is lean, which is fine it offered enough for variety without being overwhelming.  We stuck with Prosecco.  It was good, one option, a little sweet for me, but fine for a special occasion.  They offer gluten free pasta which is great!  We swapped it for the greens pasta on the menu and it was delicious. We also shared salads (Caesar), chicken parmesan, and cioppino.  The only disappointing dish was the cioppino.  To be fair, SF is in my backyard and we are the ringers for that dish, so it is hard to compare.  It was a decent dish, but if going back I wouldn't order it again.  We should have known better.  I took a scandalous (for me) bite of the chicken parmesan since it used to be one of my favorite dishes and it was perfect! It was lightly breaded, crispy, with melty cheese and a delicious sauce.  My stomach is rumbling just thinking about it.  Our service was amazing for the whole experience; the restaurant brought dessert over to the birthday girl and a free t-shirt for her.    I think if you are going to LV, take a chance and step off the strip for this little gem.  Live music, free limo rides, and good food - how can you go wrong?",

    "text": "Good Food, Good Service, and Good Time for All!   Being a tourist, but long time visitor to Las Vegas I wanted to get away from \"The Strip\" for an Italian dinner for my wife and me. We got a tip from a shoe salesman at the Outlet Mall. He suggested Casa Di Amore on Tropicana.   It was beyond our expectations! The place was full of Old School ambiance and charm. Yet it was a place that was comfortable for families with young children and other people  \"dressed to the nines.\" Oh, did I mention that there was a musical combo there, too? George, who played the key board, to me favored Sinatra when he sang, and Paul who played the drums and also sang added a real personal touch by making friends with all guests in attendance during the breaks. At the end of the first set, we were all friends.  But let's not forget the food and service. Tony was our waiter and helped us navigate the menu and drinks list. There was nothing rote about his service. He allowed my wife to sample two wines so she could decide what to order (she is not a drinker) and modify her dinner salad as she does not like certain lettuce types. The entrees we fantastic. I had the Linguini and Clams, and my wife had the special Lobster Ravioli. Both I recommend. We had coffee drinks instead of deserts.  I can understand why there were a number of \"regulars\" there this Sunday night not just enjoying the food and music, but engage the whole restaurant staff as well. If I lived in Las Vegas I'd be a regular, too.",

The decor is vintage and New York Italian restaurant style with low lighting and some big plush booths. There was a live pianist/singer there, who is talented and took requests. My husband and I requested some songs that are not well known, however he knew them all! Even though we were staying on the strip, we were willing to venture out to try authentic Italian food, which did not disappoint. I ordered the pasta with clams, which ended up being a huge serving with a generous amount of clams. My husband ordered a special, which was a pasta with pesto, seafood, and artichokes. The bartender knows how to make good old fashioneds here, and there is also a great selection of wines to choose from. The ambience is really special here, as the audience gets into the music and you truly feel like you are a local back in old Vegas.  ***I recommend making reservations if possible, as you will probably get one of the better seats. I would also recommend taking a Lyft/Uber/taxi as it would be quite a walk from the strip, and walking back afterwards could be a bit challenging since the drinks are potent and reasonably priced ;)",

There was a piano guy who was playing requests the whole time we were there. Only downside was that every time the waiter came up to me I totally felt like I was in his way because he was refilling my drink or removing my plate. He even moved my plate away from me when I was mid putting food on my fork!!!!!!! But besides the overeager waiter the food was AMAZING!!!!!! The chicken parm was to die for and the bruchetta (Is that how you spell it?) was heavenly!!!",

    "text": "We went to Casa di Amore last night for dinner and it was perfect. Even though we arrived at 830 on a Saturday night without a reservation, the hostess didn't give us any attitude, she just directed us to the bar. We ordered drinks and bruschetta and chatted and listened to the live music. About 30 minutes later they called us to a table, which seemed quite reasonable given the crowd.  Our server was friendly and prompt, and the food was great. We all thought the live music was a plus - more interesting than canned music, but at a volume where we could still talk. It's nice to have a place where you can hold a conversation without having to shout.  We left with wonderful memories and will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "On first visit, we walked in with a group of six people after arriving in their very old limo, which was a nice experience. It was extremely loud and there wasn't even a band playing (yet). The place was PACKED. I mean packed, back to back, like a can of sardines. It was hard to maneuver oneself to even get up to go to the bathroom. It is a lively atmosphere though, if that is what you are looking for. However this is not a favorable choice to go to when meeting someone's parents for the first time to share a great meal with conversation. We had to yell across the table at one another. Funny stuff.  Now onto the most important part. The \"cuisine:\"  Ok, I get it. We live in America where American Italian cuisine is heavily prevalent and this is Vegas so why not mix the two together? Casa Di Amore blends classic Italian American dishes with an old Vegas mob-style vibe to their restaurant. Dishes such as eggplant parmigiana, veal marsala, chicken marsala, baked lasagna, osso buco and the good 'ole spaghetti and meatballs are to be expected.   Frankie, Dino and Sammie would be shaking their heads in disappointment at this place.  When a customer sits down to a table, it is expected to have a waitress/waiter greet them  timely and get acquainted with the place. After we all sat down, it took anyone to come over to our table to order drinks, a good 15 minutes before we could order a couple bottles of their house wine. We were not served bread or anything.  I eventually ordered the Eggplant Di Amore. I could not believe how DRY this dish was. It was intensely dry. Being that there was spinach, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and umm...EGGPLANT...in a tomato sauce? This should not be so dry. As I cut into it, it was like cutting into a brick. \"Where are the mushrooms?..the spinach?...that sundried tomato flavor?...where is it?\" I was excited to try a twist on the classic dish but was severely disappointed. Not only was the eggplant parm dry but it was room temperature, overly salty to compensate for the lack of flavor. All I tasted was mozzarella that seemed like it was sitting there for a while and a solid hunk of nothing. My mother had the Pork Chops With Vinegar & Peppers. She was excited since she grew up with this dish. At first bite, the pork chop was so tough I couldn't tear it off with my teeth from the fork! The weirdest part was that the pork had an extreme fishy taste to it! It was unbearable!  My mother's husband ordered a piece of chicken with a potato and veggies on the side...hardly memorable. My sister ordered the Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto, which was one of the better dishes at our table. There was hardly any prosciutto in it and the spinach was \"missing\" again. I don't know if they make their own four cheese sauce but this one was especially bland. My sister's boyfriend ordered the Veal Marsala. Ok I love marsala dishes. I even prepare in my own kitchen from time to time. The veal at Casa Di Amore was overly dry and not the tender suppleness that a great veal dish should be. The marsala sauce tasted nothing like a good marsala wine was used. I was actually disgusted. His mother ordered the same and was greatly disappointed. We also received our bread when we received our entrees! blasphemy!  On the ride home, we hopped back into the limo. The limo driver was a nice woman but we weren't told that we would share our ride with a couple of other parties. There was absolutely no lighting in that limo so we were neck in neck in the darkness with strangers. We had to wait to go home because the limo driver thought it would be fit to drop those people off first. It was about an hour wait to go home when we only live a couple streets over. The limo is complimentary, but still.  Overall, the food here is not worth a second try.The classic marinara sauce in a place like this should be a signature. It is not here. For the price you are paying, the food is completely not worth it. I can find better quality for half the price, elsewhere. I am at a dismay at the hype of this place, but I suppose it is a good place to go to if your just subconsciously craving a pseudo-Italian American dish at the last minute....desperately. Ya know...that. \"I'm starving, I'll eat anything!!...let's go to 711 and get some nachos,\" mentality. The food was so bland, dry, too salty and their combination of flavors had no flavor at all. I've had a lot better experiences in Vegas with this type of cuisine. (Can I mention Buon Gustos? Thee Best!! Seriously, try it!)  Casa Di Amore needs to be toned down a little. Maybe it's too busy for themselves to handle? Maybe they would put more effort and love into their food and serve fresh food otherwise. Suffice to say, we will not be returning here.",

I love the atmosphere, love that the walls pay homage to the Rat Pack, love the very square yet cool lounge act performing in the restaurant. The host and waiters treat customers like VIPs, reminding me of Vegas when I came here 25 years ago. Nice wine list too. And they serve food until 5am! The biggest surprise was the food! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad. I don't know what they do differently, but that caesar salad was amazing. Really, really great! I'm pretty sure I tasted more parmesan than I usually do, but there were some other seasonings in there too subtle for me to identify. Fantastic! The single serving of spaghetti and meatballs was enough to feed a family of four, unnecessarily large. But despite that, and I can't believe I'm saying this, this was truly the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever tasted in my life! And I've had some of the best. I used to live i NY & NJ and I've travelled all over Italy. I certainly never expected I'd one day say the best spaghetti and meatballs I ever tasted was in Las Vegas. I wish I could afford to eat here often. That's the downside, it's just too expensive for me. But for a special occasion, or if you're rich, I totally recommend this place.",

    "text": "I came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my family (we had a party of six).  First off, we were picked up at our hotel, The Orleans, and driven to the restaurant by the complimentary limousine. The limo driver was extremely nice, the music was great and it was so relaxing not having to stress over parking or finding the exact location.   When we arrived, they immediately sat us down and took our drink orders. When they brought our drinks, one of my brothers was extremely thirsty and chugged his drink. Before he could even put down the empty glass, they were there to replace it. It was crazy how great the service was. I honestly wouldn't have even expected anyone to see that he had finished his drink since they had literally just brought it to us.   We ordered a wide variety of meals from lasagna to chicken parmesan to chicken marsala. Every single one of us LOVED the taste/quality of our meal. It was by far the best Italian food I have ever eaten.  The atmosphere was great. It's a small restaurant so there aren't an overwhleming amount of people and it has a very classy feel to it. There is live music playing old school songs (Sinatra for example) and the entire ambiance is very comforting.  Lastly, we ordered cannolis for dessert. These were also very delicious. Not to mention, the great service stated earlier was maintained throughout dinner.  This place was perfect. I debated between numerous restaurants for my birthday dinner and I was far more than satisfied with my decision. My family and I will be back for a nice dinner every time we are back in Vegas.",

    "text": "Had Christmas Eve dinner at Casa di Amore and while things started a little rough, it ended up being a very good experience.  As for the starting out rough, I had a reservation and still had to wait about 20 minutes past my reservation time. I wasn't thrilled about that. Nor was I thrilled with the noise level. When I say it was loud, I mean it was LOUD! This is an old school restaurant in an even older building. The walls are solid brick and while that adds character, there is literally nothing to absorb any sound. The space is small and they cram a lot of people inside and all their talking just bounces back at you. Add to that a talented singer/keyboard player and you get one very loud restaurant. I would actually venture to say it was the loudest restaurant I have ever been in.  From here on though everything gets better. For an appetizer we ordered the twice wrapped prawns which were incredible. Shrimp wrapped with prosciutto and cheese and then baked in dough, served with a sweet sauce that complimented everything nicely. I loved them and will definitely get them again. We also ordered the \"famous garlic loaf\" which was so good after we finished it we had to order another!  After a nice house salad I received my entree of Chicken Marsala. Two good sized pieces of chicken sauteed with mushrooms and a Marsala wine sauce that was as good as I have ever had. It came with a side of pasta. I upgraded the regular marinara sauce to meat sauce and was glad I did.  For dessert if you order a canoli or creme brulee you get a free t-shirt. I wanted the t-shirt but I wanted the tiramisu more, and it was an excellent choice.  The service was good, but not exceptional. Most of the waiters do look like they have worked there forever and ours was very knowledgeable about the menu. The host was very nice even though it did take longer than I would liked to get my table.  Overall it was a very good experience. Because of the noise level I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date unless you really don't want to be able to hear your date very well. We've all had those dates, right?  I do recommend Casa di Amore though and will definitely be back.",

Can this little party Casa Di Amore throws get any better. Yes it can! This year at Las Vegas Hotel which means you happen to be in the same building as one of Las Vegas' sport book. So yeah, place your bets if that's your thing too. Super crowd spanning all ages. Those 12 foot screens with a sound system to match makes this event as close to being there as possible.

The lemon drop was tasty. My main entree was stuffed pork chop Valdostana. The flavor was absolutely wonderful, potato was good as well as the vegetables. My only complaint is the pork chop was overcooked. For this to be a featured entree I would expect the cook or chef to know how 2 sautee a pork chop in a way where it should be melting in your mouth. Kyle was our waiter he was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The band saying happy birthday to me and I was greeted as the birthday girl once they checked our reservation.

My husband is Italian and super picky. He loved it too. Music was really good and people were dancing. My only comment on that was if they turned it down a tiny bit. We couldn't have a conversation while he was playing.",

The food is Top-Notch, from the Pizza all the way to the Steak Sinatra (which I really recommend!). Service is always great.  One of the biggest reasons we come here is the atmosphere. It's quaint with great pictures on the wall of old Vegas. Behind the bar you can find sports on TV as well as big screen TV's displaying classic Vegas scenes.   The biggest reason we come here is George, he is king of the keyboard. His melodic tones along with his keyboard really make this place a gem in Vegas. Even if the food sucked (which it doesn't.. it's awesome) we would come to see him.   I hope this place never changes. It is perfect.",

It was easy to get a reservation and they even provided transportation for us! You can't beat that.  The service was phenomenal. Our waiter, Paul, really made the night special for us. There is live music there and you can even request songs to play, and of course our wonderful waiter made sure they played a song for us. Now, about the food.... wow is all I can say. I ordered the gnocchi special which came with beef tips, gorgonzola sauce and basil. It was exceptional. My husband ordered the Veal Parmesan and ate every bit of it. We also couldn't resist getting dessert so we had the cannoli and creme brulee because they are both made in house (and you get a free t-shirt if you order one of these). Talk about melt in your mouth perfection! Needless to say, if you are in Las Vegas make sure you come here!!",

We had a pesto pasta, lasagna, chicken Marsala, cioppino, a cannoli and a slice of cheesecake. Every dish was amazing and the cheesecake was the best anyone had ever eaten. The only downside to us was that the musician they had was incredibly loud. Very good, had a Sinatra sound, but very loud. We were at a small 4 seater table and still having to almost yell at each other to hear. Overall, we would go back in a heartbeat, just at an earlier time before the music comes on.",

There is a lounge singer who sings the classics loud enough to hear, but soft enough to not intrude. We came hear with two out of town friends. We got the bruschetta and calamari for appetizers. The bruschetta was delicious, with sweet, ripe tomatoes. The calamari though was the star, very lightly breaded and flash fried, it was the best calamari I've ever had. We all shared  a bottle of wine, which was reasonably prices and tasty, a Malbec. For our entrees we ordered fettuccine with shrimp, linguini with clams in white sauce, chicken Parmesan, and gnocchi with prosciutto and spinach is a four cheese sauce. Everyone raved about their entrees. I had the gnocchi and the gnocchi were pillow soft. The sauce was rich and elegant. We ordered molten lava chocolate cake and passion fruit bomb for dessert. The cake was good, exactly what you would expect. The passion fruit bomb was divine, the sorbet inside tart mixing well with the outside, sweet chocolate shell. Altogether the meal was $208, a fair price for an exquisite dinner with excellent service.  A tip for the next time we go... Bottles of wine are 1/2 off on Mondays.",

The bruschetta tasted fresh and had plenty of topping on each crostini. We weren't too excited about the baked clams appetizer, I don't think I would order it again. My boyfriend got the steak flambe and I got the scallops Florentine, and both dishes were delicious! We had to end our meal with dessert, and both the cheesecake and creme brulee definitely hit the spot.

At least there was an area in the back we could wait in, but we did not understand why there would be an outdoor tiki themed bar at an old-school Italian restaurant. Did not make much sense. I was so excited to take my family from out of town here as I heard many locals rave over it. The loud vibe was really fun and nice. The wait staff was not the best, as I had to check many times on our table and once it was already ready and they had not came to get us. The live music was really old school, but kinda crappy. I was so excited about the food as I heard amazing things. The appetizers were good, bruschetta and calamari. We then proceeded to order and our waiter told my sister that the Gypsy pasta was a 12/10 for deliciousness, not spiciness. We all eat very spicy food regularly, but the pasta she was given was not edible whatsoever and posed a risk. We asked for marinara sauce to help make it less spicy, but even with 3 cups of sauce, it was still too spicy to eat and not enjoyable whatsoever. The lasagna and cioppino were solid, not amazing. What was most disappointing was my Steak Flambe. The waiter recommended it to me and said it was his favorite dish and described it as a Steak Diane sauce, so I proceeded to order it. Everyone's food came out before mine, so I was waiting for the table side flambe service as a Steak Flambe is generally prepared. A few minutes later, I got a plate of food that looked like something a rookie eater would be served when ordering a steak at a crappy breakfast diner. The steak was cooked to my liking, but it was extremely rubbery and had no flavor. The sauce was no Diane at all, it was almost worse than a Salisbury steak sauce. Absolutely horrible for $35. The twice baked potato was horrendous, and I could have had a better one at a fast food restaurant. Same with the veggies, nothing impressive. All in all, I was extremely disappointed which really sucks because I was sooooo excited to try this place after recently moving into the area. Probably will not be back. Hopefully you have a better experience!",

Always fantastic food, a great bar, live entertainment with crooner singing the staples from old Las Vegas, and deserts that are made fresh and  make you wish you hadn't eaten so much of the fantastic Italian cuisine prior. If there's a wait, no worries, just walk next door and shoot at the range for a while.  All in all the best Italian in Las Vegas.",

I was a little concerned about getting our food on time because they had two large parties and the restaurant was packed but they were prompt delivering the food and kept checking on us.  Great service.  We had the arancini and garlic loaf as apps.  Small Cesar salad was excellent.  It's easy to mess this salad up with too much or too little dressing or just poor dressing period but the salad was well balanced and the dressing perfect.  Dinner was the osso buco, chicken piccata and chicken marsala.  All perfectly done and the chicken was moist.  About the only thing that wad just so so was the garlic loaf.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a family type of Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Love this place.  Definitely call ahead with a reservation or go to opentable.  Had the zuppa d'clams with white wine. $16.  Dozen large half dollar size clams in a wonderful broth that comes with garlic bread for dipping - although their house bread is yummy for dipping as well.  My friend drank the broth like it was soup!  Also ordered the meatballs as an appetizer.  Wow.  $4 for 2 large meatballs - just slightly smaller than a tennis ball.  I asked for extra sauce to dip that yummy house bread in after my friend drank all my clam broth :/  We ordered the osso buco $42 which is always a hit.  Comes with risotto.  Can get a side salad or soup for an extra $3.  The Caesar had just the right amount of dressing.  Only thing missing was the anchovies.  Special soup today was Boston clam chowder.  My other friend used his finger to clean the cup clean.  What's with my friends and soup?!  I digress.  I ordered the penne pesto (garlic, pine nuts, basil, parmigiano-reggiano with heavy cream $22) I failed to see the page description of ONE POUND PASTA BOWL and ordered grilled chicken as an add on.  I was shocked to be warned that it was a $10 add on but wanted some protein to go with my oh-so needed carb craving so I agreed to it.  Later I found out that you can add chicken to the fettuccine alfredo for only $3 which made no sense but I didn't bring it up.  It did turn my 5 star experience to a 4 star.  My other friends ordered the linguini and clams (oth chopped and shelled clams $24.  Half the size of my penne but he could finish his pasta and I took mine home) and the rigatoni.  Server commented \"excellent choice\" to the rigatoni order and not to the other 3.  Didn't get the price but he ate it all.  Was on the one pound menu (emoticon with the big eyes)  I tried to look it up on their online menu but it wasn't there but I did notice that several items on their physical menu were not listed.  They also have daily specials.  Today was a grilled chicken and filet tips - both sounded fantastic.  Hopefully they'll have this on our next visit.  PERKS and FREEBIES!! free t-shirt with cannoli or creme brulee purchase. free limo service from the strip - bummer doesn't benefit us loyal and awesome locals who want to enjoy some wine with our pasta - or soup if you're my friends. lol",

From the moment you make a reservation, to walking in the door and being greeted by the host, to meeting your waiter, the service is impeccable!   Now, for the food...I had spaghetti and meatballs. They do not skimp on the portions. I have left overs for days, or you can split a meal with someone. This spaghetti is almost identical in flavor to the spaghetti I had in Southern Italy! Sooo amazing! The meatballs aren't the best I've had, but they are great too. I absolutely adore this spaghetti because they cook the noodles to perfection! My partner got Lasagna, he loved it! My mom got chicken parmigiano, it was also delicious.   I also had a party of ten, with a reservation, we were immediately seated and served drinks. Our food came out quick, & piping hot! Our server was so nice an assertive, he always smiled and took care of every need! The manager even came over to make sure everything was perfect! Now that's service!   On top of all, they had wonderful singers, two gentleman sang some of our favorite frank Sinatra songs, and serenading a 90yo birthday girl! It was fun to watch. I just love this restaurant and everything they do!",

First they offer free limo service from your hotel you just have to call ahead of time and reserve it, then when you walk into the place it is like stepping back in time The service was great and the food was tremendous. I got the Scallops Florentine, One of my sons got the twin fillet mignon, and my other son got steak flambe. We all got the Caesar salad to go with that and everybody loved their meals. To top it off they have live entertainment with just a variety of old music and it appears they take requests. We figured this restaurant had been around since the 60s but found out it's only been around for about 13 years you wouldn't know it and it was just like old Vegas.",

There's live entertainment on the weekends (not sure about other times) and that man can sing! He knows how to work up the crowd and get people dancing. It's just a feel good environment and everyone makes you feel like family in there.   First time I came, there were 3 of us and we decided to share everything we ordered: the antipasto sampler, eggplant di amore, gnocchi alla prosciutto, and their special of the night which was a herb chicken with pasta. The food was nothing short of amazing, except for the gnocci. It was too rich for my liking. Cheese sauce plus the gnocchi, which are just potato dumplings, was just too much. But other than that, food was pretty great.  Second time, my bf and I started off with their fabulous garlic loaf. When they say fabulous, they mean FABULOUS. It was stuffed with garlicky cheese and just hot out of the oven. Delizioso! Then we had the twice wrapped prawns which had a tasty sweet walnut sauce. It was pretty good but I'd say it could use less filo dough and more prosciutto and cheese. Still not bad though. Lastly, we had the fettuccine alla pappasito and that was excellent. The sausage was spiced perfectly and there was a large helping of them. Also, usually if you split an entree, they'll charge $5, but our waiter just brought out an extra plate for us to split it at the table so the $5 charge was waived. Super nice of him!  This place has been fun times each time I came and I think there will be many more visits here. Good food, live entertainment, great restaurant!",

The garlic loaf was cheesy and warm.  My husband had the eggplant and raved about it. I tried the lasagna and think it's the best I've ever had.  It was a little pricey, but still less than comparable food on the strip.  Definitely worth a try if you want to go off the strip!

Old school charm, delicious food...even a lounge singer. Our waiter Brad was great, made great recommendations and got everything perfect and timed just right.  I highly recommend a visit to this place whether you are a local or a tourist.",

Upon arrival we were greeted promptly which was a plus and seated right away! So far so good right? Even our waiter was very professional and customer friendly! So let's get to the food. Ordered the chicken Parmagina and Lobster ravioli dish(tonight's special) I wasn't impressed with my food by far and neither was my friend with his dish. I really have had much better Italian at places like Buca Di Peppo and Lavo inside the Palazzo has the best Italian dishes and service hands down! If it wasn't for the good service I may have rated lower but for those of you wondering about the limo? It's a JOKE! An old style limo with a driver in a cheap suit! Please.. Will not be retiring good thing open table awarded 1,000 dining points tonight :-/",

    "text": "After a 2.5 day video game binge I realized I was hungry, at midnight, on a Sunday ...  so I set out to find some place that was a) open b) would feed me (not just get me drunk), and c) not jack in the box(or anything of the sort).  What I found, was Casa di Amore.  First, let me say that I wasn't expecting very prompt or excellent service given the time and day, but within a minute of walking in I was seated, and very shortly there after had a glass of wine. :D Clearly I was happy with the service.  The menu was quite expansive and the wine selection was very good. After ordering, the wait for the food was relatively short given the time. around 20 min if I remember right. ... WOW! the food ... damn it was good!  The atmosphere was relaxed, not too loud, and quite comfortable all around. The background music wasn't the typical Italian joint 10 song album on repeat, it had quite a bit of variation, still lounge music but at least unique, in a way.  I'll definitely be going back, likely many times. I gave it 4 stars, would have preferred 4.5 though. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the price of the food. It seemed everything started at $20 a plate BUT it was worth it.",

    "text": "My sister, nieces and BFF took me here last saturday for my 50th, and what a wonderful evening it was!   First, a limo from the restaurant picks you up from wherever u are staying free of charge, how great is that! It is an older limo but has character and sure beats a dull cab ride any time!  We had just come from seeing Jersey Boys so this added to the theme of the evening. Now you have to reserve in advance for the limo and tip the driver but totally worth it.  The restaurant is very old Vegas decor and you would expect  Sinatra to walk in any minute. So charming. And there are a few older gentlemen crooning live which adds  to the ambience.  Our waiter Brad was very knowledgeable with our food selections and had a wonderful, playful personality. Everyone in our party ordered a different entree and all agreed the food was delicious.   Our limo was waiting promptly after we dined to take us back to our hotel. I  recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants delicious Italian cuisine and an unforgettable experience.",

Exposed brick, colored Christmas lights, live music (or singer I should say), classic Vegas photos on the wall and a more than friendly staff to ensure your experience is fantastic.   The food (in my humble opinion) was DELICIOUS, however I feel they are a bit heavy on the price tag (hence the star short of perfection). I mean, let's be real, for $19 I could make eggplant parm for an army, ha ha!   Perfect date place, dim lighting, great ambiance (as you've read in most of my reviews, ambiance is extremely important to me..makes the food taste better), and a friendly staff.   I celebrated a big birthday this year and courtesy of some pretty amazing people choosing this venue, I had the BEST time!   Check out Casa Di Amore for a swanky night out on the town with your guy or gal..totally worth the experience.",

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the ambience. It's a very cute little place and they take pride in the fact that they are reminiscent of the way Vegas used to be.   They had a small two piece band that was pretty good, not great but definitely cool to have live music.   I went with the chicken marsala that comes with pasta and added meatballs. The food was good but I also would not call it great.   Our server on the other hand, was quite possibly the best I'd ever had. It was immediately apparent that he was passionate about his job.  After our meal, the manager came over and verified that we had an enjoyable experience and I also appreciated that.   My actual review would be 3.5 stars but since that's not an option I'll round up to four because of the amazing service.   Give it a shot.",

From the live music to the red booths, it's dimly lit and romantic. It isn't quiet but it isn't so loud you can't hear each other talking. We always get the Osso Buco and it's consistently the best we've ever had. We also got the seafood special for the night which was great also. Fresh hot bread, a full bar, extensive wine list, and a good variety of desserts - along with great service - completes the experience. Robert was our server this time and he was fantastic, but every other time we have dined here we've had great service. If you're in the mood for some great Italian food while you're in Vegas, skip the fancy options on the strip and give this little joint a try.",

Great bartender, superlative steaks at a fair price, and a manager who knew my name. Who knew my wife and who appreciated big-spending return customers. And my wife and I brought family, dear friends, and clients here. Often. For years. We've spent untold thousands of dollars here over the years. But we went here for my birthday this past Friday, and right away it was different. Drinks were poorly made, subpar ingredients, and the food is clearly not at the level they were turning out even five years ago. Subpar steaks, weak apps, bland sides. What a True shame. The waiters here remain great, but even their courtesy, kindness, and professionalism couldn't make up for the marginal quality of the food. And they seem to value loud and obnoxious tourists over locals now. They didn't used to. As I say, it breaks my heart to give them a bad review because Casa was part of our Vegas life for years. Maybe it was an off night. I get that. But it didn't feel like it. This formerly locals joint has slipped. Far. Too far for us to return. What an absolute damned shame. We used to love Casa.",

Nice bottle of red too. Excellent casual service and a great value for a really great meal in a very expensive city-",

My eldest actually chose a family dinner at Casa Di Amore as her 'birthday gift' from Grandma.  This was what she wanted because as she says: \" I love that place\".  So tonight we went and had the time of her life...as we left she said, \"I will never forget this Grandma\".  (Yep we all teared up).  From the kind efforts to seat us near the live entertainment, the Kiddie cocktails, the delicious pizza and our adult pasta choices...things just continued to get better. Happy Birthday was sang to G-daughter with smiles never fading. Wishes were shared to her from other customers.    A large wedding party came in and the Bride danced her groom then with G-daughter to celebrate both of their special days. FOOD DELICIOUS- MEMORIES PRICELESS!",

A Frank Sinatra atmosphere to set the mood whether you're on a romantic date, or simply dining with friends and family. Reservations are recommended.   The food quality is excellent. My personal favorite was the Spaghetti and Meatballs and Minestrone soup. Decent size portions depending on what you order.   There is a tiki bar attached to the back of the restaurant. Per the staff, it's not opened year round. Summer is a good time to check it out. Tuesdays and Thursdays are the days to avoid as they have it closed. Unfortunately I was unable to experience it the first time I came here but hoping to go sometime soon.",

Hours maybe a bit of a challenge as they don't open until 5, but honestly with the wait for great food that is much less expensive that the hotels and great service as well.

Nice limo too.  Bonus.  The place smells good when you come in.  We waited for our table at the bar.  My GF hit four of a kind on a VP machine and won over $200.00.  Nice way to start the evening. $$$  Really, this place is awesome.  From the drinks, the food, the live music, and service.  I had the Veal Parmesan.  It was terrific.  GF had the Lobster Ravioli, #2 Daughter had the Cioppino.  We shared the Fried Calamari and a Antipasto Salad.  There was so much food!  Perfect old Vegas style without being cheesy.

The food was okay my wife liked hers a lot, as for me the linguine with clams was ehhh..hopefully this was just a bad first experience and later if we ever go here again it mate turn into a great one but as for now it wasn't the romantic outing I hoped for or planned for",

But as I write this we are sick in our hotel room with wicked food poisoning. We ordered the calamari, stuffed clams and penne in vodka sauce. We didn't wait for the penne. We sent back the food and left. The calamari was so greasy and it came out brown instead of the usual golden color you would expect. The cuts were too thick as if the squid that they used were larger squids for stuffing. The stuffed clams were little cherrystones that tasted more like uncooked breadcrumbs than actual stuffed clams. The ones i've bought frozen at Vons are at least edible. These were gross. The food poisoning most likely came from the calamari since my wife didn't touch clams. In the process of writing this she's been back to the bathroom 3x to hug the bowl. Great way to spend a weekend.",

The restaurant was very busy with live music both inside the restaurant as well as at the outdoor tiki bar. We were able to grab a couple seats at the inside bar while we waited for our table and had two excellent cocktails; better yet, they were comped when you play the poker machines. We got seated a bit later than our reservation time, but the food was well worth the wait. I had the veal francaise and my mom had the veal cannelloni; both were excellent! We probably could've split the cannelloni, so if you don't have a big appetite, I'd recommend splitting that and maybe getting an appetizer. This was our second time at Casa Di Amore in two months and I'll go back every time I'm in Vegas. It's a cool old school place with good service and even better food; I totally recommend it.",

It had probably about 1.5 cups of noodles and 2 meatballs. This was absolutely ridiculous for the price!!! Needless to say we left mad and hungry. I looked at the menu for regular dining and prices are way higher...im sure the dish may be a Little bigger -Hopefully! Couldnt even get bread at an italian bar for the price!

The food unfortunately was JUST ok. Ravioli is oversized and a little doughy, but tasty. Order in the blush/vodka sauce which is better than the Alfredo. We tried both.  Caprese was disappointing. The tomatoes looked like they were winter tomatoes (pale!!!) not summer tomatoes (red!!!). Not sure why since we came in the middle of June and this place is in Vegas.  The lasagna was 100% mushy in each layer and was unappetizing. We had to send this back sadly. Also disappointing since this is a very popular dish and we would expect for it to be spot on!  Atmosphere here is divey, dark, and a little tacky with colorful lights near the bar. It seemed like they have gimmicks to get you in and have a great time (wonderful music, limo ride) but the food is just ok.  Service was excellent. Our server took care of us and didn't hassle us about the lasagna. They were packed on a late weekday night and getting our food took a while.",

The veal Parm was not crunchy, maybe they just baked it instead of frying it first. It was O.K. I had spumoni for desert and it was not ice cream, but gilarto. It was not O.K. For $170 a meal should not be just O.K.",

If you aren't too worried about price and want some delicious Italian food, just go.   It was a little busy and we didn't have a reservation, but luckily they had an open table for us. The ambiance feels very old school and cozy. It's a popular spot for visitors, but the service was still quite good.  We ordered Linguini Luciano and Gnocchi. Both dishes were very very good. Some of the best Italian food I've had in Vegas.  It does come at a price though. Expect to spend a little more than you would at Olive Garden.",

Our waitress was a quick-wristed, Italian woman called Guiseppe. Masoli organized the dinner, so he put a lot of pressure on everyone at the table to order foods that rhyme with his name. Unfortunately, this limited us to ravioli and cannolis. The live music was incredible, although some of the lyrics were a little bit different from what I remembered (e.g. \"when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's Masoli\"). The women there were much nicer than most women. Instead of getting angry when I asked them questions on their way to the bathroom, they just ignored me. Guiseppe gave me a cannoli even though I didn't order one. In Italy, this means a woman is in love with you. \"Cannoli\" literally translates to \"little tube\". The suggestion was obvious; she wanted a little tube in return. I decided I couldn't reciprocate the gesture when I saw Guiseppe offering cannolis to literally everyone. Casa di Amore:  Masoli, ravioli, cannoli",

It is loud and fun. The room is lined with pics of old Vegas. They have comfy booths, a bar in back, live music and all the usual red sauce type food along with a few unexpected items on a good sized menu. I had the Eggplant Di Amore which is similar to Lasagna and a side of meat balls. My partner had the Chicken Marsala. the food was very good. The Meatballs were fantastic. Casa Di Amore is going to be my new meatball fix spot. Our waitress was excellent, very friendly and helpful with all of our questions. All in all it was a fun lively night with good food and service. I will return soon.",

It looks like a hole in the wall joint, but once you get inside, its a cozy traditional NYC italian atmosphere. Our server, Stephan, was great. My husband and I moved to Las Vegas from Chicago, and we've been very unimpressed by the service in this city. Stephan was a breath of fresh air. The food was fantastic. I'm a New York Italian, and my husband has worked with traditional Italian circuses, and we were very impressed. This place has so may specials (half price bottles of wine, half price pizzas and cocktails) and it's open and serving until 5am to boot!!! This place has now become our favorite hang out in Las Vegas. I would recommend it to anyone, and dare them to not fall in love.",

Our server Toni was so nice, friendly and made our experience there worthwhile.  The performer (George Bugatti) sounded just like Sinatra (if you closed your eyes, you would swear it was really him).  It was nice to go somewhere off the strip and have it give you the Vegas feeling.  They even have a limo (free w/ tip) to come and get you and bring you back if you want.  You get a free t-shirt if you order the creme brulee or cannoli for dessert - which we did. There were quite a few birthdays/anniversaries that were being celebrated.  I would highly recommend it and will make it a point to go back when I return.  One last thing - there was a lieutenant in the air force who was being deployed next week there with his family.  The restaurant must have been notified about it b/c they announced it and everyone clapped for him.  They comped his dinner which was extremely classy in my book!",

    "text": "When we arrived, it was around 1 am. You have to ring a doorbell to be allowed into the building, which could be either entertaining or annoying depending on your disposition. Once inside, there's a bar area and then a restaurant right past it. The walls are decorated with photos of old Vegas's hey day, with Frank Sinatra, the Flamingo, the Sands and other old locales pictured. It's pretty cool, and during their earlier hours they have live entertainment performing.  After midnight they have a special on their bar menu, 1/2 off on all the food. It's basic appetizers and sandwiches, like wings, chicken fingers, sandwiches and pizza. They also have 1/2 off wine on Sundays and Mondays, which we took advantage of while we were there. Their full restaurant menu is also available, so it's worth checking out.    We started out with a half price bottle of wine that was suggested by our server. It was a good choice, with low-acidity and a robust, smooth fruity flavor that beautifully compliments a variety of meals. We enjoyed it, savouring a glass each throughout our meal and bringing the rest home. It's a really nice deal! Worth going on a slow day to take advantage of that fact.   Matt, our server, was pleasant and performed a polite demonstration of table service with our wine. He handled the front of house aspect very well considering how busy he was, going back and forth from the restaurant area and the bar.   Our meal started with a bread basket with butter and then the caprese salad. The bread had a crisp exterior with a softer interior and was good with the butter. Not baked on premises, I'm guessing- more likely from the Great Buns bakery down the street, because we were given a loaf later and it was completely identical to the first, a signature of mass manufacturing. I didn't eat too much of it, though, because I didn't want to fill up on starch. As far as the caprese, the tomatoes were mushy and largely flavorless; mealy and obviously refrigerated. I understand the necessity of doing so, but in a dish like caprese salad, comprised solely of the tomatoes, mozzarella, basil & olive oil, it's imperative that the ingredients be Truely flavorful. It was mild & a bit mediocre. We ate it, but it wasn't really worth getting excited over.  We then had the Osso Bucco, or slow-roasted veal shank in a tomato based sauce, with a side of risotto. I immediately noticed that the risotto was REALLY dry and crumbly. Because of the sauciness of the osso bucco, it worked out well enough for me to eat a small portion of the meal, but I wasn't particularly impressed. On the menu they brag that the meat is so tender a knife isn't needed, but I used one. There are tendon pieces, or tougher ligaments that need it on the outer portion of the meat but the interior it IS indeed very tender.   This is a restaurant with potential, though it failed to meet my expectations. My boyfriend and I shared our meal and we had enough leftover for our lunches today.   I may come back to enjoy their half priced wine and chicken wings. It seemed the bar had a very boisterous clientele, so maybe that's the place to be at the time of night we were being served.  We took most of our meal to go. I asked about how dry the risotto was, so the server promised it would be rehydrated for me to take home. Upon reheating for lunch it was still crumbly and dry, though perhaps slightly better. Our server gave us a loaf of free bread to take home with our leftovers, which was a nice touch.",

And for the entree i would order their version of a spinach tortillini or their chicken parmesian.. their pizza arent bad either all very good. prices, may be a little pricey but well worth it.. They also have a live band in the evening you may want to call them and ask. I highly sugget this place if you want to relax and enjoy an italian style ambiance with good food. only downside is it is located in the horrible neighborhood just make sure you park your car in a well lighted area..",

The portions were large and we were able to split meals between two people. The staff was okay with the splitting of meals and continued to give us great service.  The atmosphere reminded me of old style Las Vegas of the 60s and 70s. Tables were set in such a way you felt like you had your own space and were not sitting on top of others. The booths were in the old style as well. The entertainer for the night sang mostly Sinatra and Martin songs. He did an an outstanding job.  The next time I am in Vegas, I will be eating here again.",

The food is always cooked fresh and is very good.  They also bake their own bread.      I almost always sit at the bar in the back and gamble and drink.  Service at the bar, or if you decide to dine in, is always phenominal.  Keep in mind it is a small dining area and bar, however, it is well worth the wait.

We celebrated our engagement here.   Do yourself a favor and eat the stuffed pork chops here before you die. The best I have ever had. They have a great wine selection. The family and friendly environment adds to the quality of this place.   You can not go wrong. The prices atmosphere and lets not forget the amazing food have this place right up there with the best of Las Vegas. Sure it's not the most expensive, rare, or trendy place in Vegas, but who the hell wants all of that all of the time?",

A great date place for people that don't take themselves seriously and wan't to have fun. The Steak Flambe was very good and the Chicken Picatta my friend had was good as well.",

But if there is a request, they will do their best. We were celebrating my granddaughters 21st birthday and I was afraid that this place wasn't to her liking but she said she loved it! Not a big restaurant so be sure to make a reservation. A bit noisy but lively. The service was incredible. A little pricy but for the experience, it was well worth it. They also will pick you up in a limo and take you back to your hotel, complementary. I was told they are closing down next week for remodeling but will reopen with wonderful changes. I can't wait to go back. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they picked us up in a new red van rather than a limo. When I told my waiter I was disappointed, he made sure we went back in the limo. The food.....amazing!",

Casa di Amore is your spot - they offer to pick you up in a limo and then you take a step back in time.   We ordered the chicken parm & it was amazing - must order whenever you go to this restaurant! It is the perfect combo of chicken, cheese and sauce. yummm :)  Also, their drinks are very reasonable at about $8 each. If you are a bit of a wine snob, you may want to bring your own bottle and pay the super reasonable corkage. :)  All in all, great experience & would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Not quite 5 stars, but neither is it 4 stars. I agree with Dad on this one: 4.5 (Unfortunately, I can't give half stars). But since everybody else LOVES this place, I'll bump it up to 5 instead of giving it 4 stars (this one's for you Dad, since I just rated the Buffet at the Bellagio for Mom).  A limo from the restaurant came to pick us up at 7:25 PM for our reservations at 7:45 PM. Dad said the limo was complimentary... I have no idea. Dad did the research and made the reservations- I just tag along and eat.  GARLIC LOAF: Loaf of homemade bread sliced and stuffed with garlic, Italian seasonings, mozzarella and parmesan cheese. It was VERY good, albeit a little salty/garlic-y. And maybe a little too cheesy. But still delicious.  OSSO BUCO: It literally is fall-off-the-bone good as the restaurant claims. Not too salty (which is a big thing for me). But the shank is HUGE.  PORK CHOPS SICILIAN: I think Dad ordered this. Two 8 oz pork chops served with potatoes and vegetables. Definitely a man's meal.  CIOPPINO: Very tasty dish comprised of fresh seafood including: lobster, clams, mussels, scallops, crab, cod, and shrimp. The soup part goes very well with bread (but I'm trying to lay off the carbs). I'm pretty sure Dad enjoyed it, though. He claimed he was stuffed, but kept dipping bread into the soup.  Dad also ordered a side of meatballs, which I heard were pretty good, too. There's just a little bit of spice in it to add a little kick, according to the waitress.  The waitress was extremely friendly, and there was live entertainment. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert. Definitely next time, especially since they're open until 5 AM!",

    "text": "Okay so me and my husband dine out a lot and when we dine out  we expect a nice experience.  I was very excited to try this place since it had such great reviews however my excitement went to pure disappointment when I walked in and they sat us at a small tiny ass table right in the middle of the walkway with people bumping into me  and every staff member walking right past us for 15 minutes not even asking us if we want anything to drink,  this table was obviously on the pay no mind list Now normally I'm a nice person I try not to get to diva but this table was actually really ridiculous,   ok enough about that so I went up to the manager and I said to him do you have a different tableabd within I want to say 10 minutes 15 minutes he had a different table for us which was great he was also taken care of also at the end of the night.   Other than the whole table issue everything else was pretty much okay the atmosphere was really nice the food was okay not the best I've ever had but it was good.  I think this place is more interested in catering to larger parties  then a small bill for two people which is understandable that they going to make more money on a larger party then they are two people I get it but still we are paying customers so we should be just as important.  Um I'm not sure I'll come back maybe I will but at least I can scratch this one off my bucket list.  Oh and by the way I never got my free t-shirt with my cannoli purchase so for that reason I'm taking another star off.",

The wner is entertaining, he plays instruments, sings to everyone and keeps the atmosphere very upbeat and fun.  We came with a big group from work and we were all apprehensive about the appearance and the location, but were we surprised.  The waiters were terrific, the place was filled with locals and the decor is that old school rat pack, Vegas as it used to be style, its really nicely done.  I had the veal. Tammy the linguine & clams, we both shared and the food was great, portions were huge and the rest of the people we were with all had the same compliments.  The drinks were healthy and the wine list, although limited, was sufficient and well thought out.  This is the type of fun place, that the owner should be proud to own and as a patron, i was glad we were lucky enough to go in here.  I will definitely be back again and again and if we laugh 1/2 as much next time as we did last time, then it will be 2wice as much as we would have expected anywhere else.  I could go on and on about this place, the food, the music, the fun, the people, the service, the friendliness and spirit - were a perfect combination and even as i finish this review, i wish i were there.",

    "text": "My friends and I went to Vegas for a girls' weekend.   We had one night where we were going to splurge on dinner, so we wanted the second night to be more low key and less expensive.  I did a search on Yelp and found Casa di Amore and decided to try it.  As someone who grew up in Vegas, I really don't expect much of places that are \"off the Strip\", but I will definitely be going back here!  First of all, the fact they have FREE limo service (although they do suggest you tip $5 per person per way) to and from the restaurant is awesome.  Granted, the limos look like they stepped out of 1992.... do they even make maroon limos anymore???  Our driver was really nice though, and impressed us at his ability to maneuver the traffic even though he was, shall we say, a mature old chap. :)    The restaurant is this cute little brick building and seems a bit out of place on the street.  Inside, it is reminiscent of something you would find out of \"The Godfather\" (minus the guns and shooting).    Ahhh,.... the food was SOOOO good.  We had to place a second order of the bruschetta - it was the best I've ever had.  We decided to order family style since there were five of us, and I'm glad we did because the portions were huge.  We got three dishes - the clam linguine, eggplant parmesan and I can't remember the third... but all were amazing.  Seriously - I highly recommend trying this place out.  It is a small joint so definitely make reservations before hand.  Also, allow plenty of time if you decide to use the limo.  We had tickets to see a show afterward and our limo driver ended up leaving to take someone else back to their hotel... we had to wait for twenty minutes for him to come back and barely made it to our show in time.  But our tummies were happy so we didn't complain too much. ;)  This place is definitely old Vegas in a good way, and worth a trip to try it out!",

The common thought was that it reminded them of old school Las Vegas. I arrived a few minutes early and our table was put together even before our actual reservation time.

From the moment they greet you on your arrival to the time that they seat you & take your order and serve, it's a smooth and seem less process. Our host, Tony took very well care of us and gave us recommendations that were superb. We were personally visited, at our table, by the manager, Smith who checked up on is and gave us complimentary desserts. I have previously sent two separate family members who each got married in Vegas to Casa de Amore and each of them gave high and great compliments to the place. Alexandra, the lady who took our reservations and who welcomed us as soon as we arrived was very sweet, professional, cordial, & it shows that she loves what she does.  The food was magnificent and the entertainment, by Paul and Randy was so lively and fun. I think that every selection in the menu are all very delicious.  I recommend this place to everyone.

    "text": "Where can you get a fabulous Italian dinner at 12am when in Vegas? At Casa Di Amore!  After a night on Fremont Street a group of six of us took a Lyft to this fantastic place.  Time has stood still in this place. The walls are decorated in pictures of Frank Sinatra,  Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Marilyn Monroe and many more. Lovely Italian music fills the room. It's funny how these song are so recognizable when you hear them. There was also a tiki bar out back that we all ventured out to see when we spotted the giant gorilla. We finally all got settled into our booth ready for our midnight feast. The menu is everything Italian you can imagine. We got garlic cheese bread, lasagna, giant raviolis, fettuccine and one pound pasta bowls!  We ate until we could eat no more. The food was fresh and tasty. The staff were so friendly and fun. I saw a small stage where the band plays nightly. Oh how fun that would be to see. I felt like I was in the Moonstruck movie eating dinner with the Castorini's.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant in a random location. Hint: You can request free limo service from anywhere on the Strip. It's quite small, so definitely make a reservation.  The ambiance and decor are the True draw of this spot. It's very old school Vegas. There are old school pictures of Vegas and various celebrities all around the restaurant and bar.  At the rear of the restaurant is the bar. There's video poker, of course. Hint: If waiting at the bar for a table to be ready, they cannot transfer your drink bill to your table, so you must pay the bartender before being seated at your table. There are several cocktails and a few wines by the glass. The wine menu was a little underwhelming.  Despite trying to be more upscale and fancy-ish, this is a rather casual spot. There were kids running around and lots of folks in jeans and sweatshirts.  The live music is a great touch and adds to the ambiance and decor. However, it also escalates the noise level. Between the band and the patrons, we couldn't even hear each other - and we were at a tiny two person table. Hint: Request a booth on the far side from the band. There's some seriously awful acoustics in this place. The noise level and the inability to carry on a conversation with your date really kills the romance.  For food, we opted for a side caesar salad, the bone-in ribeye steak flambe and the gypsy pasta. The food portions are pretty generous. The salad was nothing of note. Hint: While there's free bread, they don't give you olive oil and balsamic vinegar, just butter. The steak was tasty, but not mouthwatering or crave-worthy. The gypsy pasta was crazy spicy - and I love spicy. It was almost too much it was so spicy. And the pastas are 1 lb, so it was a significantly large portion.  The service was nice and friendly. Our waters were never empty, we were checked on, etc., etc.  All in all, I like the concept, which is what gives it the 4 stars. And I'd be willing to come back, perhaps on a less busy night, and try some other menu items. But I didn't love what we ordered and the noise level seriously dampened our experience. While a good spot if you're looking for a vintage Vegas vibe, If you're looking for a nice, romantic restaurant, this is not that spot. But totally good for experiencing that old school Vegas feel.",

We were the first ones there. It's located in a big of a sketchy part of town and doesn't look like much from outside. However it's romantic and makes you feel like you are in another era.  They open the doors right at 5pm. I would say make sure to have reservations as they filled up fast as soon as doors opened. The service was amazing and attentive. The food was authentic & amazing Italian.  You have to order the garlic loaf with marinara sauce. Mmmm to die for !! I ordered the Osso buco and it was the best thing I've ever tried ! For dessert we got a cannoli. The order comes with only one so if you still have room order one per person lol. I was stuffed so sharing one was fine. As locals here in Vegas we definitely will be back and bringing family & friends.",

I have lived here since 1985 and am sorry to say I did not ever hear about this restaurant until my daughter brought it to my attention last week.  Best baked clams ever.  Best rice balls.  My daughter, the vegetarian, ordered the house salad and eggplant parm.  Both delicious.  My husband had the lasagna, delicious as well.  I was just slightly disappointed in my veal special.  It should have been Milanese but had a sauce which it did not need.  We ordered 2 desserts.  Cannoli, and spumoni.  Both excellent.  Best part of the experience... our server and the 2 piece combo!

We started with the calamari. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I had the linguini and clams in a white sauce. Clams were perfect and fresh. The linguini Wes well done and sauce.... let's just say nothing was left on my plate. We had the Astoria Prosecco with our meal and finished it all with that cannoli. Full belly and content. I almost didn't want to leave. All that was missing was Bugsy Segal to walk in.",

We made reservations on a hunch that it may be a good restraunt and could get busy. When we first arrived, it was at the very beginning of dinner.  The place had only a few customers besides us. Well.... we learned quickly, good thing we made reservations,  because the line formed like lightning! We were treated by our Server Stephen, who explained all the HOMEMADE recipes on thier menu, how they have a band that starts shortly, and proceeded to give us a short story on the background of the restaurant. Its family recipes, family operated and how they love to hear the customers say it feels like home. They have a 60s-70s old Vegas decor, live band, and Everything we tried was absolutely on point. Service is very focused on making you comfortable and full of amazing food.  There were couples actually dancing near thier tables to the music, atmosphere is very very cool and vintage style Vegas. We came from across town to try it, and was pleasantly pleased. They are definitely not a turn and burn get you in get you out hurry hurry cause we dont want you here type of restaurant.  We HIGHLY recommend them and ask for Stephen. I'll bet I've driven  by this place 100s of times and never knew it was there.. I could kick myself for not finding it sooner.",

As the night went on realize Casa Di Amore is pretty cool spot for lot of reasons. I had ask my friend who mind you doesn't even live here find I feel hole in the wall spot. He was watching reality show jersey shore and guess they were in vegas came to eat here at Casa Di Amore. I was like interesting.  So to start defines hole in the wall for me. It located off Tropicana past eastern and really not in the best part of town. It small place so easy past by it. I did! The best way if going for the first time look for Dutch Bros literally neighbor good to go. The minute walk in was totally nothing I would expect from the outside or the area. There no windows all around the building so going in for the first time like bam. Lot of nostalgia photos of old school Vegas from pictures of the strip, back in the days of the rat pack, and not doubt know walking into italian restaurant. It low ceilings so the place give it even more of intimate vibe, lot of booths on the sides (the booths got that old school lounge vibe to them) never see that style much, and the best part mention all this old school.  They have live band three piece band. Not sure often they play but they were there when I went and they were great! They play all your classic italian songs that you know and also take requests. The band all packed in tight in one spot. All older gentlemen so make it more classic vibes. We went on half price wine night so talk about packed. They literally not open table and wait list. So if you go on that night plan ahead. Half off any wine pretty good deal. We had two bottle that night for the table.  The food is solid solid classic italian food. They cover just about every dish you could imagine in pretty big size menu for that size restaurant. I ended up getting the baked mostaccioli. I enjoyed. The marinara sauce was good. The pasta was cooked perfect. Sometimes bake pasta dish worry about the pasta. It still was moist and al dente with the nice top layer of melted cheese. Overall hearty dish. I order side of meatball just wanted to try. It was good. Nothing would rave about. We ordered bunch of appetizers all to share. They were all just solid classic italian food. Calamari, Fried Ravioli, and few more. The house bread is pretty tasty stuff too. The portion size is one thing LOVE nothing small about any menu item. I look around the table like dam that good size portion. I had hard time finishing my dish.   The service was five stars. Our server was awesome for big group. All first time great job explaining everything the half price wines, the menu, specials, and five stars on point.   So if looking for classic straight forward italian food. Off the strip Casa Di Amore great spot.....!!!",

I heard about this place from someone I met on a business trip in the Midwest and he said it was his best Italian meal he ever had (which I doubted at the time). Sooo glad I took a chance as no one could stop eating.  The prosciutto mozzarella crostini with red pepper appetizer was a perfect way to start the evening.  The ciopino was a major hit. Service was fun and on top of everything.  Live holiday music made it a tad loud for conversation but it really rev'd up the mood.   People rave about the garlic loaf but we all thought the house bread with the ciopino broth was the better option so you can pass on that.  We think you can pass on the eggplant parm as well.  Everything else was superb and just a fun place to be.   Did I mention wine bottles are half price on Mondays?",

Our waiter brought us warm bread and softened butter and greeted us with a welcoming smile. He told us the specials and soups for the evening and I decided to order one of their specials which was the barramundi fish topped with tiny lobster with a light herb red sauce. It came with creamy stuffed potato sprinkled with paprika and herbs and a variety of steamed vegetables. The fish was cooked perfectly which was very moist and the stuffed potato was so creamy. Also you can add a soup or salad for only $3 so I decided to add one the special soup of the evening which was clam chowder and it was also good. For dessert I had the tiramisu which they make in house.  It was very creamy and light and so delicious that I wanted more of it. The restaurant was decorated like an old world style Italian restaurant with pictures that adorned the walls and it's a little dark in there. They have a singer with a drummer on Friday's and Saturdays there and the drummer goes around before they start and on his breaks to talk to the guests. In fact they dedicated a song to my friend and I while we were eating dinner even though it wasn't a special occasion at all. He said it was just because he saw 2 beautiful girls having dinner together. I thought that was really nice. Our waiter gave us great customer service. It was really busy that night and it was a Saturday night. Also they have a tiki bar with lounge chairs outside which we went to hang out after our dinner. It was really fun to hang out at the tiki bar. They will also start to have a band out there when our warm weather is more consistent. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone for the food and service and also if you want to just come and hang out at the tiki bar outside for a drink or 2 and have food out there. Also the food outside in the tiki bar is a different menu. You'll be very satisfied when you visit here.",

The flavor of this dish is very good. My belly was a lil on fire I'm not gonna lie. The bread is tasty and crunchy! I loved it. We ordered the calamari and it was yummy as well as the sauce. I just gave them four due to my salad being a little bit old (brown edges on the leafs and really droopy pieces). Overall I appreciated the meal and it's flavor. The ambiance and wait staff made our visit great. Oh! They have great live music too!",

Garlic loaf....fantastic....sauce on the side..BLOWN AWAY!!!! Next time im there I'm gonna have to ask them what else that sauce is used on because i make my own and quite proud of it!!! This put mine to shame!! I'm not sure if it's because I was caught off gaurd not expecting much or if it was because i didnt have to spend hours prepping and a day and a half simmering. Personally....i think it was JUST THAT GOOD!!! I love chicken parm....saw menu and though HELL NO to $27...now im like....hereeee..TAKE MY MONEY!!! Also....can't quite remember the hours but the tiki bar out back (kid friendly) has pizza and drinks half price!! Gonna give a shout out to DUTCH BROTHERS next door...without them i would have never spotted this hidden little gem!!!",

Let's talk about why...  My first experience here was like no other in Vegas. I usually stick to the strip and veer off only when it's a True joint to go to.  This was one must visit. And we had a friggin blast. The meal was so enjoyable and the entertainment was what was expected. Exceptional.   The second visit was anticipated to be top notch because by that time we learned a pro tip. Which was you get a free car service to pick you up and drop you off after your meal.... WHAT!  Super awesome tip from a fellow YELPER. Thanks cuz that worked out great.    That advantage of that service. Our driver was exceptional and even checked up on us during our meal. So sweet!   This is were my review goes grim. Holy crap... the menu special was not what I expected.  You better know your fish when you order it and know what it looks like.  My sea bass was not chelean. It was from somewhere else sea bass. Wtf. Lmao. Anyway still good but not what was expected.   Order freely tho because everything we've ordered has always been great. Make sure to order the Canoli for desert. You'll love it and you get a free novelty shirt to go home with.",

First time back in the fall was absolutely perfect. This time was perfect as well. Wait staff was very attentive but not overbearing. Appetizers and entree was excellent.   Had the combo app. While it is a lot of fried food, everything was great. Split the Chicken Marsala for entree and it was very good. Personally, had the Chicken Parm on 1st visit which I prefer. Desert was the cheesecake. Not sure if I've had better (even in NYC).  The only subpar comment was the cocktail. Ordered a Scotch neat. Very small pour for the price.   The ambience feels like \"old Vegas.\" The entertainment is enjoyable and not overbearing. Will always make a point to go anytime I'm in LV. They even have complimentary shuttle back to the strip. No reason to waste $ on Uber.",

    "text": "So I'm in Las Vegas for a class and I needed to find a place to eat dinner. I had prime rib last night so I thought why not Italian...so I yelped and found Casa Di Amore.   This place is off strip obviously and is located in this sort of weirdly constructed plaza. The parking is \"limited\" in the sense that there are only a few spaces pretty near the front...but there is a bunch of parking located in the back. You can come in from the back but I didn't know that. Anyway I got here around 545-6pm. It was already full of patrons not entirely packed but for opening at 5pm I was surprised.  I think this is where a bunch of locals come to eat...which is pretty cool. I was seated immediately...party of ONE. Haha! Their menu looks pretty extensive...but in reality the last couple of pages are just wine. I decided on the frutti di mare - seafood linguini - you have the choice between white and red sauce and I chose white. The dish itself is $35 and you can add a side salad or soup for an additional $3...which I did...Caesar salad. They also give you some fresh bread with a delicious flavored butter or you can also dip it in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.   When my entree came out...they started some live music. Great singer singing in the Frank Sinatra style. The pasta was cooked the way I like it...but for some they may think it's a bit over cooked. There is a ton of seafood in it which makes it a bit more worth it in my mind as well.   I think if you're interested in going off strip this is definitely a place to check out.",

After having dinner, we came out side to the tiki bar area which is really interesting so we can stay chill & watch football. I am very glad that I came here & found out about this hidden gem.",

I know many people dine at the restaurant because of the delicious food, well last night I had the pleasure of attending a private party in their newly renovated outside bar/ lounge area, and I was blown away. Not only is it beautifully designed, it is very clean with amazing tiki bar vibes! Great seating, cozy outdoor lounge sofas, and fun games, with plenty of misters and fans to keep guest cool and relaxed!   The menu at the bar is different then outside, but still fabulous! It's always happy hour, how awesome is that?? Let me just add that the pizzas are delicious! The veggie white pizza is to DIE FOR! We also ordered the meat ball sliders, as well as the anti pasta salad, both very fresh and yummy! What I really love about the happy hour menu, is the fact that it's not just only bar food!   Casa De Amore is a great place for a nice Italian dinner, yet offers plenty of versatility, especially if your feeling up for a drink, you don't have to go far! Just step outside and enjoy! Such a great spot  for a date night, and an even better place just to hang out with friends,  whether it's after work, or a night out.   PS. I totally forgot to take photos but I will be sure to add them when I return. Caught in the moment!",

Remember the abandoned restaurant the Fratelli's were hanging at in The Goonies?  Similar.  Anyway, glad we went in.  The food was superb, the atmosphere was perfect and the service was fantastic.  The entertainment...well, he sounded JUST like Frank Sinatra...but he looked like Ronnie from Jersey Shore.  Still great.  Pricing was pretty moderate.  I was full and happy when we left.",

First of all a few things that might have skewed my experience.   1) There's no decent Italian in Hawaii 2) I just spent the rest of the weekend in Vegas spending triple digits on food that wasn't astonishing.  THIS PLACE IS AMAZING  It's open super late, the staff is incredibly accomodating and the food is out of this world.    we got pasta, pasta and pastas and destroyed their large enough to share portions individually.  NOTE:  Their Fra Diavolo is not joking around, i spent a week eating sichuan hot pot and this bowl had my mouth on fire.  Super thankful we ran into some friends that live in the area, otherwise we would have never found this place.  SO GOOD.",

    "text": "After driving by this place a million times while previously visiting Vegas, I sincerely resigned to never eating there because it looks really cheap and cheesy.  After searching for the highest ratest restaraunts in Las Vegas however, I found that this place had wonderful reviews AND free limo service!   So, during our las LV stay, we called the phone number listed on the website, made a reservation for dinner and limo pick up.  Easy!  The very friendly limo driver gave us a courtesy call to let us know he has ten minutes out. He greeted us with a handshake, a smile and great conversation.   We were promptly seated and offered drinks when we arrived to the restaraunt.  And, yes, it is as cheesy-looking as I thought it would be.  However, the entertainer was great, singing and playing the piano all night.  You can tell it's a locals' spot with all of the great banter going on around us.  My partner ordered a steak, and I ordered a chicken dish...it was all delicious.  The service could not have been better.  If you are looking to get off the overpriced strip and try something new, do it here.",

I wish they would have kept playing non stop but I understand that they need to pace themselves and give people time to chit chat.  Great service friendly place I wish I lived closer I would come at least once a month.  Thank You for a wonderful night!",

We ate here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty full.  The service was good but the singer was not very good.  I felt embarrassed for him a couple of times as he kept hitting the wrong notes.  The music was a little louder than I liked and it made it difficult to have a conversation.  The food was very tasty, the portions just right, but the prices were a little steep for the location.  $22 for a plate of gnocchi was a bit too much for this old building.  I say that if you drive a 78 Cadillac and think slicked back hair is cool then this place is for you.",

The food is good too. The green salad came with real \"green\" instead of iceberg, the chicken noodles soup is delish, and the bread is warm and addictive. My friend ordered the house favorite vinegar and pepper pork chop and he loved it. The spice and vinegar is too pungent for me but for those who love it, it's great flavor. I had the fillet and risotto special. It's good but not great. The steak over cooked and risotto too mushy. Not gonna dog them for it. Still a great experience. Definitely will return when I'm back!",

    "text": "This was such a fun night here. It really is a locals place. The only bad part about the night was we had a reservation and it took them 45 minutes to seat us so maybe they overbook or don't plan well for how long people will linger.  It was half price night for wine so you could get a bottle of wine for the cost of 3 glasses of wine so we said why not! It was very much the east coast style Italian restaurant. Small, dark, intimate with a real lounge style singer covering all the classics. It was a two person band and they did a pretty decent job of everything they did.  Be prepared to be a part of the act. We were there mid week and during our 2-3 hours of being there they sang happy birthday 6 times and the whole restaurant joins in!! It was great!  Now how about the food? I was expecting to be unimpressed but it was pretty darn good. Don't be looking for Italy style Italian food but instead think heavy New York Italian and you will be bursting at the seems and very happy. For the older crowd I am sorry to say they do not have spumoni. My Mom was with me and she was really hopeful that a place like this would but everything we got was great. I had chicken parmesan and she had a pasta dish.   If/when I go back to Las Vegas I will get off the strip one night and eat here again.",

We were sat at a table very close to the front and had an up close view of the entertainment. We enjoyed listening to some old love songs some Sinatra and felt like we had stepped back in time.  We ordered the antipasti salad, and it was delicious and huge!! Salami, marinated veggies, large pieces of cheese and a great vinaigrette. We looked like we barely made a dent in it and had to take some home. The waiter offered to store it in the fridge for us and I thought that was a very nice touch.   My partner ordered the steak flambe, which has a delicious Demi glaze and was cooked to a perfect medium.   I ordered the lobster ravioli which was served in a red cream sauce. The ravioli had perfect pieces of lobster in them and the cream sauce was flavorful without being overpowering to the pasta.  The bread was fresh and warm and our server made sure we had fresh bread for our entrees.  We finished off the evening with a cannoli and it was one of the best I've ever had! We even got a \"leave the gun take the cannoli\" t-shirt!   A great time with great service! Definitely a check off the restaurant bucket list for Las Vegas.",

We had to almost yell to hear each other over the music.    Upon entering we were met by a server who ended up being our waitress who was anything but hospitable and service oriented.    Food arrived and it was as if it came from a box.  Nothing was fresh as the menu stated.   This place only received three stars because of an amazing employee named Cisco.  Had it not been for his amazing service and friendly attitude this would have been one star at best.",

Lasagna  4. Fettuccine  None were worth the $50 per person! Honestly, the Olive Garden is better! Pasta was bland ( marinara) and the chicken, although it was tender, there was so much mozzarella on it, that's all you could taste. The 20% gratuity was mandatory. I tip according to the food and server. I usually do tip that amount, but being told I had to really irks me! And spending $500 for mediocre food was ludicrous! Won't go back. Being of Italian descent I admit I'm picky, but even the others were not happy with their food.",

The hostess was very friendly and apologetic, promising us we could get tiki drinks at the inside bar, which unfortunately was not True as the Tiki bartender was devoted to only serving the private party. We decided to stay and sit at the bar, and we ordered appetizers and drinks- all of which were delicious. The bartender was efficient but gave off an \"I hate this job\" vibe, and the customer next to me was obviously a regular who complained loudly and non-stop about the crowd. The live music was a bit too \"slow jams from the 70's\" for me, and we sat through 5 performances of \"Happy Birthday\" in less than 2 hours. The food and service are pretty good, but the old-school atmosphere wasn't my style. Still want to try the tiki drinks, so will return for that.",

    "text": "Fun place with live band on Sat. night. Four of us showed up without reservations but the lovely Maitre'D found us seating in the packed place within about 10 minutes.   From the start our server made us feel like part of the family. Stephan (sp) was great ensuring drinks were full, telling us about the red sauce's history and telling us the band members' names.   The environment is noisy and casual. A few less decibels would have made conversation a little easier for our 65+ year old ears! The waiter also mentioned there is a shuttle bus if necessary.  Dinner was a bit overpriced in my mind. $200 (with tax & tip) for 4 of us with 3 drinks, 3 dinner salads and no dessert tops our usual bills by at least $50. I had the fruitti di mare which was about the most expensive thing on the menu at $35. It was good, but really for 2 shrimp, 2 clams, 3 mussels a handfull of calamari and I believe some fish $35 was defi itely high. I usually pay about $28. It's my go to comparative dish by which I judge Italian restaurants. I ordered the Frau Diavlo sauce which did have a kick, just the right amount, but lacked maybe some garlic and could have used a bit more salt. The portion was generous (I took half home) but not as generous as the lunguini with calamari which was about $8 less.   My husband's scallops au gratin were superb. I would have liked to lick the plate! Perfectly cooked scallops in a marvelous cheese sauce had him nearly drooling.  Our friends, Italians from Chicago, both enjoyed their meals. It was great to hear compliments from them on the red sauce.   All in all, aside from the noise level (it was Saturday night) and price tag a very enjoyable evening with warm, friendly people. We're looking forward to trying it again during the week!",

Service was good when she was around... it wasn't to busy only a third full. Which was shocking to me cause it was always to capacity the plus thirty times I've dined here.  Food Average at best. We had the chops and peppers my go to Chops were bone on for the first time and about a third smaller My G F had the Cioppino it was okay nothing to write home about We were told this was the best dish in the house.... Hummm  The prices have gone up the service was a2.5 when every other time I've been there has been a 5 star experience great service not last night.  I usually always recommend Casa Di Amore Sad to say ill say go at your own risk To much money for average meal",

We had reservations and were seated promptly. Lucky to get the last booth. Shortly after we were seated the room began filling up. Two nearby tables were being set for a party of 16 and party of 8. On this evening the two piece band provided a variety of easy listening music.   The menu has a wide variety, meats, seafood and pasta's. Also a nice selection of wines by the glass and bottle.  After a few minutes our server Robert appeared and offered us a selection of water. That was followed by a basket of crusty bread and butter. We also received some olive oil and balsamic which was a wonderful complement for the bread.  Our starter this evening was Baked Clams. Ten nice size clams stuffed with bread crumbs, garlic, parmigiano  reggiano, oregano and parsley all nestled in a tasty broth. An excellent appetizer and delicious broth that was soaked up with crusty bread.  Entrees included Chicken Piccata and Cioppino. Two large boneless chicken breasts sauteed with butter, lemon, mushrooms, white wine and capers. The chicken was fork tender with the sauce having a rich butter and lemon flavor. The chicken is generally served with a side of pasta but was swapped for a double baked potato. Plenty of chicken was left over to take home.   The Ciopinno is served in a large bowl that contained a large portion of seafood including lobster, clams, mussels, scallops, crab, cod and shrimp. All floating a savory broth. Plenty of broth to be soaked up with more of the crusty bread. The Cioppino was excellent, served the way I prefer, without calamari.",

The servers were well-polished and unpretentious. Even the manager was extremely hospitable and treated us like family.  My family and I ordered the following:   Lasagna    A Chicken Marsala    A Eggplant parmigiana   B Fettuccine Alfredo   B  The pasta is made in house, which I love. Now if that weren't enough, you also get FREE entertainment. That's right, live music and the singer has a lot of soul. If you're fortunate enough to chat with him, he'll share fascinating stories about everybody who's anybody in the music industry.  This place stays crowded, so make reservations.",

A waste of 140$ just for us two to eat. The server with the too knot bun was awful. Didn't go over specials or ask if we wanted to hear it until we asked. Would be talking to us as he was waking away. It was just horrible!!!! Cold food after waiting forever and the baked clams were just bread crumbs! Like literally bread crumbs . I will never step foot in there again. It use to be a packed house and people waiting outside to eat. On a Saturday night at 9 pm was three tables and that included my husband and I. Awful waste of money and didn't eat our food to go to fast food after ! Highly disappointing and don't recommend",

    "text": "So I thought long and hard about this review as I really wanted this to be one of the high lights of my trip. Tour guide suggested this as a local spot with home cooked food. Online they offered free limo service for the strip hotels so I booked about 2 months in advance. My pickup time was 7pm with dinner at 7:10-7:15 (this is what the girl on the phone stated when I booked).  The day of the reservation we got out side about 6:50 and at 7:05 when no one came I called the restaurant. They stated that they were trying to call me all day and that they had a party of 46 that they gave our table to to accommodate them. I stated that I never received a call and I gave them my phone number. The guy on the phone said that the number was written down incorrectly. That should of been the clue to not go but I had a gift certificate and the guy on the phone after several apologies stated that if I got a cab the restaurant would pay and they would seat us as soon as we got there. So ok we got there and could tell the dinning room was small and filled!!  The hostess seamed new and I gave our name several times as she was trying to add us to the 46 party. A guy came over greeted and apologized for the mixup, took my receipt for the cab and said we would be seated shortly. We walked over to the bar and ended up waiting about 45 min. At that point we moved back to the hostess station as I felt we were forgotten. About 15 min later and more headache we were seated.  The waiter was the best part of the dinner he was friendly and engaged.  The (I guess) manager came over apologized again for the mix up and offered us dessert.   Now if that wasn't enough there was a 2 man band playing that was also very good and I could of sat there for hours drinking wine and listening to them however at one point the restaurant let the organizer of the 46 sing and than speak to their group. At that point all the other tables were told by their tables that we had to be quiet and constantly heard (sssh) (sssh).  We got our food and it was ok.   But at the end of the day with everything else that happened here did not live up to my expectations.  I get it was 46 people and they didn't want to loose that bill but they should of just closed the restaurant for a private party especially since they literally took over the restaurant!!  With that experience I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "To start my review, this will be the nice version I bet my mother will write one too and she is much harsher than me. So... good or bad news first? I'll do bad (maybe the good will make up for the negative). We made reservations 2 months in advanced at the time they had a limo service they offered to pick you up from your hotel to the resturant. (Hello bonus!) I loved this thought because it is quite difficult to get from one place to another one block in Vegas is very different from a normal city block. Anyway, we waited and limo never came (7:00) we called and they told us the limo broke down (a while ago) and that we will just have to catch a cab and they will pay for it (I was very understanding). Oh little side note we have been in Vegas a week now and this is the third place we've booked in Vegas that has called telling us their car or bus has broken down. So we got to the resturant around 7:20 they said they would sit us immediately (they didn't) we didn't get seated until 8:10 (reservations were at 7:10). Now this is we're I will stop and say that there was a huge factor in this they had a 46 (or some ridiculous number) of singing women (annoying as crap they were all drunk old women who claimed they sing in a group which I personally thought that was just a college sorority thing) party. Their reservation was 7:30 (we overheard). They got seated right away. Now I also learned the bus (they lost their limo a while back) had to pick some of these women up. Myself I have never worked in a resturant but I do have many many friends that do or have. I decided to text these friends while there (during my very long wait) and they all agreed that the party of 46 should've reserved the entire resturant (it was a pretty small place maybe 8 or 10 tables not taken over by these women) or the manger/boss/whoever should've personally reserved the resturant just for this party and not allowed any other parties in that night. Now the good news the food was great the service was amazing and I say this not because they had us wait so long and didn't pick us up but because I truly believe they have amazing service every other night. Personally if the party of 46 was not there that night it would've been a perfect night with great food and my review would be a tad shorter and five stars. The staff was very nice and wonderful people so I do not really blame anyone for what has happened tonight except for the group of 46. So in conclusion (cause I've basically wrote an essay hahaha) it was a terrific resturant very good atmosphere but for any groups of 46 please request the place to yourself for the night and for any mangers please allow them. Overall I would recommend to a friend and this review got good stars for the fact that tonight was not the restaurants fault (fully) but just bad timing and planning.",

    "text": "When planning our most recent trip into Vegas, the girlfriend and I decided we wanted to get away from the Strip and do something different, and Casa di Amore seemed to fit the bill. I made reservations with their complimentary limo service a little over two weeks in advance, just to be safe, but I think you could get away with reserving it the week of your visit. Our driver arrived promptly and was very friendly on the short trip to and from the hotel. Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were seated promptly and treated to exceptional service from our waiter, Stephen. He was very professional and extremely helpful, but also very personable and friendly -- he earned one or two stars on his own. (I had no idea about the pint chug challenge at the Aria, but thanks to Stephen, I'll be trying that on my next Vegas trip.)  The food was nothing short of delicious. I ordered the Chicken Caprese at Stephen's suggestion and my girlfriend ordered the house specialty, the Osso Bucco. Both dishes were tender, flavorful, and came in very large servings. Neither of us had room for dessert, though there were many tempting options on the menu. (It was challenging enough finishing our bottle of wine after all that food.)  Great ambiance. The live music was entertaining, the decor hearkened back to old school Vegas, and every staff member we encountered was wonderful. Could not have asked for anything more in this area.  One more note: while this place gets the $$$ by Yelp standards (upwards of $30 per person), it's fairly priced for a delicious Italian meal in a very fun environment.  Throw in the free limousine service, the discounts on wine bottles on Sun/Mon, and the exceptional waitstaff and it's unlikely that you'll be disappointed in your dining experience.  We'll definitely be bringing friends back with us on our next weekend in Vegas.",

This family friendly place, has a live band to keep you occupied in your seats while you wait a while for your meal. The price is a little high, for not getting fresh food.

    "text": "WOW. Thank you Yelper friends for referring us to such a gem. Absolutely a new favorite for us. Came in this Friday evening to a full house complete with live performers. Being Vegas natives we really appreciated the atmosphere- odes to old Vegas Strip scenery and pop culture/entertainers. The noise level is a little on the loud side, but we actually enjoyed being able to carry on a conversation without worrying about being overheard or being too noisy. Everybody is too busy having a great time. And as busy as they were tonight, we were still seated within 10 minutes. Score. No need for us to order any appetizers, as gratis fresh hot baked bread and butter was provided. Oh my yum. Who doesn't love a hot bread roll fresh out of the oven? So tasty, nonetheless. We helped ourself to another as soon as the first quickly disappeared from the table. The gnocchi alla prosciutto was to die for. The cheesy sauce was light didn't overpower the taste of the prosciutto. A delicate touch of spinach was a perfect inclusion. And a perfectly sized portion for a hungry tummy! Boyfriend had the chicken parm with a side of meatballs, which were wonderfully tender and juicy. We finished our meal with a cannoli. It was baked just the way a cannoli should be done- toasted outside (not soft!), rich and thick cream on the inside.  Staff was all incredibly friendly. Our meal was concluded with a visit from the manager who made sure our experience was to our liking and shook both our hands. I wish we could remember our server's name, he was awesome! Thank you all for such a great evening! We will definitely be back soon!",

This place is old time Vegas at its best.  There are vintage pictures on the wall of Vegas locations and the many movie stars who have played Vegas locations over the years.   There was live entertainment the night we were there which only added to the ambiance. Our server was very customer service oriented and took the time to answer all questions we had about the menu and the specials that evening.  There was about 7 of us and we all seemed to order something different.  Everything was fresh and delicious--especially the Sea Bass that was the special fish of the evening. I could sense that this is a mainstay location of the locals and it is always nice to find a diamond in the rough!  Can't wait to go back on our next Vegas trip.....",

It wasn't until 8pm that we were finally being seated at our table.  What's the point of a reservation?  The prices are way too expensive for the quality of food.  The pastas aren't even made in house.  The sauces were bland.  I found adding copious amounts of salt gave the food some flavor.    One other good thing was our server though.

Stephen (our server) was excellent and engaged us in conversation from the get go which is so key to experiencing great customer service today. The food was incredible. Music was amazing and made us feel like dancing - terrific singer/musicians playing old Vegas tunes. We started with calamari with the marina sauce (yummy) and an Opollo Zin wine together with the bread/evoo-vinegar. The Pasta allo Fordo was amazing, penne arbiatta the best spicy ness, and the kids has homemade chicken soup (Gma's recipe to die for), spaghetti/meatballs and fettuccine which were all great. The cannoli - lets just say this rivals a a famous baker who's jersey roots has a shop here in LV. Direct your orders here vs there!! Thanks Stephen.",

The last time I was there it was for an early dinner and we were some of the only people in the place, this time as I said jumping. They had a singer at a keyboard and he brought the diners into his act, the atmosphere was more like being at a party, a total turnaround from my last visit.  Food was very good, everyone enjoyed their selections. The t-shirts were a nice bonus.",

The bill that I had could have been used for Giada's Italian restaurant on the Strip and most likely could have been a heck of a lot cheaper. Come on, I order a thirty dollar plate and your going to charge me four dollars for the Alfredo sauce? Yes it's a cool environment and the staff was friendly but as soon as we sat down we were advised that there is only one server and it may be a while. For a 160.00 bill your going to staff one server? The food was not bad but got cold after a few minutes. The pasta was not consistent. I'm so sad to leave this.",

I loved the warm cozy atmosphere and the music was a nice touch however it was drafty in the restaurant and very busy.  The food is over priced and the drinks were very expensive.  I got sick after eating the chicken parm.  I am from the east coast and I that's what I was expecting however sadly disappointed.  Chicago joes is better food and less expensive",

And he gave us a cannoli to celebrate! Great evening :)",

I loved the live music and they way everyone was so into it by signing and having a good time ! The food was beyond amazing !  For desert we tried the cannoli best damn thing I have ever tasted in my life  ! Overall this place was amazing I recommend it to anyone !",

The lack of organization and service soured our experience enough that we won't be returning. We waited 90 minutes for our food due to another party's food coming up around the same time. For a business that has been around this long I would've thought they'd have figured out how to handle that.  That was a poor excuse for letting us wait 30 minutes past when they were \"plating\" our food for us to actually get it, without giving us the courtesy of checking in to let us know some mistake had been made. The place was swarming with servers, if ours had been overloaded we'd be able to be a little more understanding.   By the way the crispy salmon is a solid choice. The Alfredo with sausage was good as well. Our sons ravioli seemed like it used the gypsy sauce instead of a standard marinara and our little guy couldn't quite take it.",

After checking around for dinner places to celebrate our 25th anniversary, we decided on Casa di Amore based on other Yelpers' reviews.  We wanted someplace off the Strip that locals might go to.  And boy, did Casa di Amore deliver! It looked & felt like old Vegas, during the Rat Pack days.  The decor, the entertainment, the 'feel'; it has it all.  An added bonus was it was half-price wine Monday.  ALL bottled wines are half price!    The service was above & beyond from our waitress, Lynn.  She let us taste a couple of wines before buying. (She also let me try the gnocchi before I ordered but asked me not to tell so this is our little secret.)  Hubby had the rib eye with cabernet demi-glaze & peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to perfection. I had the gnocchi florentine with prosciutto in a white wine cream sauce. Lynn said we can request any ingredients be added or removed so I added sauteed mushrooms.  M-M-M!  Desert was a wonderful tiramisu.  The live entertainment was a two-man combo, keyboard & drums. They looked like they could have played the Sands or the Stardust way back when. The dinner music just adds that little 'something' to make the night special.",

I will have to order that for myself sometime, but I get distracted by the baked Mostaccioli frequently.  I tried the baked lasagna, but it was not a solid lasagna slice like you would expect.  It was loose, disappointing.  I tried my friends vegetarian meatball dish and the vegi meatballs were actually quite good.  I am a meat eater and I may order some for my meal next time.  Basil flavored.  Cocktails are really good here.  All sorts of flavors.  My favorite part: I love the 60's feel with lounge musicians.   The night gets better the later it gets. They will even pick your group up at hotels, but not residences.  Too bad for me.  At least the walk isn't too far.  I hope this place never changes.  It just feels so good to be here.  The staff is super friendly and I will be coming back here for a long time.  If you are looking for a quiet place to go, this is not it.  It is fine for children to come if they can handle noise and people.  Good place overall, good food.  I bring all my friends here when they visit, or just when I need somewhere fun to go with my husband after a long work day.",

The food is excellent.  Most italian restaurants cook northern italian, this one has a Sicillian flair.  Since I am from NY and Italian, giving this restaurant 5 stars says a lot!",

Staff was very friendly and service was good. My drink never ran empty, dishes were cleared promptly and the server was gracious.   The live music was a nice touch. I arrived around 6pm and the place was pretty empty but by 7:30pm the place was packed. It was quite loud which made for a good atmosphere and since I was by myself it didn't really bother me but it might be hard for people trying to have conversation.   The lobster ravioli and Caesar salad were good, as was the warm bread. The exotic bomba, which is tropical sorbet in a white chocolate shell was quite delicious.   The reason I gave four stars instead of five was the shrimp scampi. It was just ok. I love shrimp scampi and this just didn't hit the spot. Maybe next time I would stick to a standard pasta and sauce dish. Based on the service and all the other items I would recommend it and would go again.",

It's in a seedier end of town actually not that nice inside.  Having said that, the food was quite good. The sauce was good, garlic bread also very good, and they had a surprising prawn appetizer which they wrapped in bacon and served with a peanut caramel sauce.  All in all a good spot, just know that if the prices were a little lower and you have a better understanding of where you're going it makes for a better experience. No need to dress up",

    "text": "I have been coming here since I moved to Vegas in 2006. I love the food here. I've tried maybe 3 plates to be honest, once I ordered the Shrimp alla Vodka it was all over. That's literally the only thing I've ordered since my third time there. It used to be 24 hour food, then it stopped being 24 hours and went to 3 am - 10 am bar only, now I'm not sure what it is because I haven't honestly been there in about a year. But I think about it daily, and wish that it was closer to where I live or drive past for work so I could go there for food. The last time I was there it was the same waiter that served me 10 years before, and just about every time I'd been after my first, and he not only remembered me but covered the cost of my desserts as well. I recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas looking for an \"authentic\" meal, but also to anyone that lives in LV that hasn't been here yet. This place has both ambiance, with the 2 person band playing old Sinatra classics, but the locked front door and open backdoor with security checking you in feeling like you're something special for knowing one of the few LV secrets left in town. The food, let's be honest, is better than whatever the cr@p was you ate at the casino last night. If you're a local, you know that because you don't go to casinos anymore. The ambiance is like a 1970's gangster get together with Sinatra wannabe's crowing in the background. Not to make the singers sound bad, but nobody is Sinatra except Sinatra, so F off haters. They do their best, but that's all they can do is their best. Nobody is Sinatra except Sinatra. Story end. The food is better than anything you'll get at some overpriced Strip extravaganza. It's not new, or special, just the best. If you want the best, come here. The locals know it, and if you don't and you're a local, rethink your life. You don't truly love Italian food until you've been here.",

The waiters have always been what seem to be handsome Italian men and the most fun servers. This place reminds me of a venue that would be in a mob movie. Has live talented music.  The food is some of the best I have tasted. The Garlic Loaf is to die for! Alfredo is my favorite. And the limo ride to and from the restaurant is complimentary with a tip to the driver.

    "text": "What a bizarre little restaurant. Friend and I were driving down Trop and craving Italian. Saw this place out of the corner of my eye and decided to swing in. Didn't have high hopes because of the name (seemed a little cheesy), but figured it was worth a shot. There is some sort of inner-dimensional time shifting porthole just outside the front door, because as soon as you step in the restaurant you transported to Brooklyn circa 1978.   The place was packed, and I mean wall to wall. Grabbed a seat in the bar and just fell in \"like\" with the place. I can only describe the whole event as surreal. There was even a guy at the bar that looks like he was cast out of \"Goodfellas.\" I still think he was paid by the restaurant to be there.   Service was good, ambiance was outstanding, food was 4/5 stars. Had stuffed ravioli, the cheese was great, but pasta was not great. Salad was very good with a house made dressing. Also ordered spaghetti with Gypsy sauce. They will warn you that it is spicy. Let me warn you, IT IS SPICY. I had to dilute it with marinara. Very good though, and the meat balls were great.   Would have given 5 stars but I thought it was a little pricey for both location and quality of food. Also, I am pretty sure my Johnny Walker Black was a Red. Might have been a mistake on the order from the noise of the festivities, but I got charged for a Black.   I would go back, mostly for the ambiance and that Gypsy sauce. I recommend it, but stay away from drinks or your bill will be high, high, high. And make sure you stroll through the bar to see if they have the \"Goodfellas\" guy there, he made my night just by his presence alone.",

Had veal and chicken francaise and both were tender but sauce was very heavy vs brothy,lemony, buttery it should be.  Theirs was more like the consistency of a hollandaise sauce. Good dessert. Overall good, I just live across town and came after a Rebel game cuz it was close to T&M. Would I travel across town? No, would I stop by if I was within 10 minute drive-yes.",

There was great live music playing motown and a lot of Frank Sinatra.   We initially had a bad experience with service here. I made a reservation for four for 8pm, and we were not seated until 8:30p.m. The manager did not really acknowledge the fact that we were waiting so long. After our meal, the manager asked us how our experience was and I complained about the wait at the beginning. The manager gave us free desert, which to me made up for our initial bad experienced.  I am coming from NYC so I know good Italian food and am used to NYC prices. The prices here are around $25-30 per plate which is the typical NYC mid-range restaurant price. I ordered the Veal marsala and it was delicious. My father ordered the Veal francese and he found it to be very good. My mother and girlfriend had different scallop dishes and really enjoyed them.  One cool thing I learned is you can be picked up and dropped off by a limo for free from anywhere on the strip (obviously tipping the driver though) but you have to book in advance.   Overall I would say this is a very fun place to go, good food, good atmosphere and fair prices.",

Usually, with live entertainment, we would literally be screaming at each other, but this place this was not a problem. We were still able to talk to each other while the live entertainment is going on. Service was excellent.  We had their garlic loaf, chicken parmigiana and eggplant di amore.

Ok here is my break down.  1) Surprise factor- the outside and location are the perfect counterpoint to the inside. 2)The front desk is friendly and quick.  3) The calamari is fantastic 4) the drinks are great and reasonable 5) the portions are huge 6) the food is delicious- the meat sauce? Forgetaboutit! 7) the chicken marsala- excellent 8) order a dessert for $10 and you get a teeshirt. 9) the guys singing are \"so on point\" with tunes from the past. 10) if you want to, you can dance And 10- drum roll please  They have a shuttle to take you home.   How can this not turn into a perfect night? Ask yourself- don't we deserve this! And the answer is Yes, We Do!",

Craig the driver was great and gave us recommendations on what to order!  The ambiance is nice, just a little noisy but it wasn't a big deal and that was probably only due to people having conversations over the live music. Which was great!   The bread was warm and well toasted and the garlic butter made for a great start to our dinner. We ordered 3 baskets of bread which we ended up regretting because we couldn't finish our meal or we over ate by a lot! Haha! The clam chowder was delicious and so were the salads. The main course were all very delicious! I ordered the shrimp scampi yum! My brother ordered the seafood bowl (don't remember the name) but Craig recommended it and he loved it! My mom ordered fettuccine Alfredo (her fav) with shrimp and she loved it. My husband ordered chicken parmigiana and he said it was good. Finally my dad ordered one of the specials which was breaded chicken with veggies and I think (I didn't pay enough attention as I was really enjoying my dish) baked potato and it was good.  We never made it to dessert sadly. :(  Our waiter I think was Kyle...? (He's somewhat new in town) anyway, he was great! He was patient as we had him come back a few times for our order because we couldn't decide.   This was my husband's and my second time back and we'll be back!!  I just want to add that no one ordered steak because we went to a steak house the night before so not sure how that is but based on what we got I'm sure it's good! Price was good for what you get!  Hope you enjoy it as we did!",

It started of with the restaurant sending a courtesy shuttle to our hotel to take us to the restaurant. Craig our driver was such a gentleman and very kind, we enjoyed the ride there almost as much as the food haha.   Once we got there, we felt like we were transported back to the 1940s. There was live music playing Sinatra's hits and the ambiance was incredible. It was very charming, we had to keep reminding ourselves that we were in Vegas. The staff were so warm and welcoming. We loved our waitress Claudia, who seemed to be very passionate about the food and excited to share it with us.   The food was out of this world! If there is one thing I could recommend, it is the garlic loaf. Cheese on the inside, cheese on the outside.. lots of cheese!!! The jumbo homemade ravioli with the meat sauce was made from scratch. It was some of the best Italian food I have ever had.   At the end of our meal, Alex (the owners wife) came by to check in on us. We talked for 15 minutes where she shared some of the history of the restaurant and her own background. She was so kind and accommodating.   If you want exceptional service, amazing food and a warm ambiance that makes you feel like your transported back to the 1940s, this is the place for you. We are already counting down until the next time we get to go there!",

    "text": "Old school Vegas atmosphere meets some pretty good food and stiff drinks with live music geared toward the elderly, way too loud and none too hip which really put a damper on the ambience.  The fettuccine alla Pappasito was excellent, super flavorful Italian sausage amongst a bed of pasta with four cheese, sweet onion and wine sauce.  Delectable.  We also tried the gnocchi, which is in a similar sauce but that comes out just a little too salty from the prosciutto.  Still a good dish though.  Great bread and butter provided.  Drinks-wise we had a yummy chocolate martini and the mamma Mia margarita, the latter of which was very strong as well as tasty.  You get your moneys worth in the booze.  We split two desserts, both perfect - the chocolate souffle and the creme brulee.  Neither could have been better.  But, holy crap the awful live music.  So loud.  So \"easy listening\".  So...not good.  Think of the worst music your seventy year old parents listened to in the 70s sung by someone who didn't make it on his own and that's about accurate.   Tip:  If you are going to pay for live music at your restaurant it should be better than playing the radio and not so loud that diners can't comfortable converse without shouting.  I take a star away for the music, which is something I don't think I have ever done before but we were so glad when the guy went on break for a bit that we joked about whether we could tip him to take a longer break.  And every restaurant we have been to since that played some recorded rock music at a reasonable volume has garnered some extra appreciation from us.  Maybe find out when they don't have live music and go then?",

    "text": "We have passed by this restaurant a million times before and finally stopped in last night. It has an old Vegas feel (in a good way). The lighting is dim, there's a bar in the back, and entertainment every night.    The live band was amazing playing oldies like, stand by me, sittin on the dock of the bay, and they even sang the ABC's to entertain my kids which luckily the crowd thought was funny as well.   The menu is big, they have it all! If there is an Italian dish you are craving you will find it here. They even have a kids menu. We ordered chicken parmigiana and osso buco. It was delicious!! Oh and the cannoli for dessert was so so good.  Service: the service was ok a little slow but ok. The one thing that angered me was, we were 5 people and a baby. The baby sat in a high chair... didn't order (she's 1 and ate off of our plates). But when we got our bill we were still charged the 20% gratuity because of the baby!!!! To me that is absolutely ridiculous.",

I've been back at least three times since I wrote my original review and have thoroughly enjoyed each visit more than my last. When they first open, you're treated like kings, the food is prepared carefully with extra TLC and the tiki bar in the back is perfect after you eat!   My favorites: calamari, garlic cheese bread fo lyfe, veal parm, stuffed pork chops, antipasti platter/salad (HUGE) & the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo - their fettuccine is made in house which is even more special.   This is quite possibly my top three favorite Las Vegas restaurants. You should definitely go (and go early if you do)!",

This a total throw back to old classic Vegas. I love it.  Old pics of the strip, tufted leather booths. Great marinara sauce. Our waiter was a talker! Live entertainment in the evening, and there's a big tiki bar behind the restaurant (we have kids - we didn't go).  Anyway, the food was delicious and abundant! We had the calamari fritti, baked ziti, sausage, meatballs, steak.  All excellently prepared.  For my particular taste, everything was heavy on the salt, but the family did not seem to mind a bit.  We are definitely coming back.",

My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday we got here on a Sunday evening at 5pm got to park in front went in got greeted by a friendly staff and sat down almost immediately. They have pictures up of old Vegas ,actors and other stars all over the combination of brick wall and dim lighting definitely set a more romantic dinner atmosphere along with the music in the background and the live singer was setting up to get his show started . Wish I could have had some wine but I'm pregnant at the moment so it will have to wait .  The server was quick and so was the table runner we did not run out of anything or had any complaints they were aware we were on a time schedule and were fast .We got warm bread .  ordered the calamari the best I have ever had so meaty with a side of Marinara sauce ugh it was gone in 2 minutes!!!...our meals spaghetti and meatballs basic I know but every year on my bday I eat pasta yum the portion is so big I took left overs and still had enough for lunch and dinner next day .  He got the Rib Eye ripped right off the bone perfectly seasoned ...what rib eye ?! Lol plate was wiped cleaned .  The only thing was the water i don't like faucet water but that's not their fault I ordered a Diet Coke instead .  The food , the service , the ambiance deserves the 5 stars !!!",

This year we decided to spend our Valentines eating at Casa Di Amore, we didn't call ahead for a reservation but showed up around 7 PM. We were told at first that that there are no tables and were no longer taking reservations. We completely understood. Although after waiting to see if there were any cancellations a staff member informed us that a table was prepared and was available.   Upon being seated they provided a complimentary chocolate heart candy box to my fiance which made our time at the restaurant that much better. We had a wonderful time as usual dinning at the restaurant. Even with no reservation, the restaurant being max capacity we didn't feel at any time rushed. This just shows you the level the restaurant operates to create a great experiencing to guests. As usual our plates were wonderful, and the atmosphere perfect.",

At the time we went there was live music which gave the romantic feel.  This place is good for a dinner date...Drinks after work.. or with family.  For food: Bread was mediocre.  1. Hot antipasto platter: mozzarella sticks and calamari were good.. but I personally loved the shrimp and the ravioli the best.  The nation's marinara sauce it comes with is absolutley amazing. 2. Osso Buco was very tender and juicy. Definitely recommend! 3. Cioppino: if you're a seafood person this is an awesome soup dish. I'm not really into tomato based broth but this broth was delicious and very addicting. Definitely a must try. 4. Side of meatballs: if you don't have a dish that has them you can order these on the side. Very tasty and hearty. The meat sauce that comes with this compliments very well. I found the bread useful here  5. Tiramisu: even after being so full.. this dessert was finished. Made with love and total perfection.  Also lighter and fluffier than other tiramisu I have had  Overall the place  is great.. I would've given 5 stars..if not for these few things: parking is not the best... place is very crowded... found it very loud. Note we did come at a prime dinner time.  Hope this helps! Don't forget Monday is half priced bottled wine!",

The noise level is a bit loud but the food more than made up for that.  Our party of seven  ordered fried calamari and arancini rice balls for appetizers and they were amazing.    Our main dishes included osso bucco,  linguini with white clam sauce,  seafood pasta,  stuffed pork chops,  cioppino,  and pasta Luciano.  The osso bucco was fork tender and very tasty.  The seafood pasta came with plenty of seafood and pasta.  The cioppino came piled high with shrimp,  calamari,  clams,  crab claws,   lobster tail,  and mussels all steaming in a very flavorful broth. Probably my favorite was the pasta Luciano which had a spicy tomato base with tons of calamari and linguini.    For dessert we split the spumoni ball and tiramisu.  The giant spumoni ball was a huge ball of spumoni ice cream coated in chocolate which was delicious.  The tiramisu was creamy with just the right amount of espresso.    Also,  this restaurant offers transportation to and from the restaurant from your hotel/resort so you can drink at this wonderful establishment and not be a designated driver.",

I'm giving it 5 stars for the experience  - that of a 1950s style eatery complete with live music and a very attentive and friendly staff.  We made reservations on a Wednesday night, arrived early and were still able to get seated relatively easily around 7pm.  It get more crowded as the night progresses.  Casa Di Amore has a number of classic Italian dishes.  We got the Mini Oso Bucco ($14), Calamari ($14), Gypsy Pasta ($26), Chicken Marsala ($27) and the Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto ($23).  All portions were quite generous, and in fact I could have eaten the Mini Oso Bucco as a main.  We had freshly baked house bread that came with garlic butter plus oil and vinegar.    The Oso Bucco was very tender and the risotto it came on was excellent. I definitely would recommend this dish!  I liked the Calamari but it was borderline too crunchy.  Probably the \"worst\" dish was the Gypsy pasta.  If you're used to Thai food, it's not that spicy - has a nice kick, but I didn't find it that special and probably wouldn't order that again.  Overall, a fun place to take friends from out of town.",

We ordered the garlic bread that everyone raved about - it was similar to what I make at home. It was good, but nothing special. The Caesar Salad was HORRIBLE. Nothing good about the salad at all, and I love Caesar salad. The entree's were all good, except my order was wrong. I ordered Shrimp Fettuccini and they brought me chicken. When I told them that wasn't what I ordered, the waiter said it was....the other 3 in our group all said \"no, she said shrimp.\" Anyhow, they remade the order, but it took me so long to get it everyone else was done eating. Whatever my son ordered, he liked it but commented \"It's good, but for $26, it isn't any better than the $14 version I've gotten at (another restaurant).\"  With that said, the Shrimp Fettuccini was AMAZING. Probably the best I've ever had, which pretty much made up for everything.  The restaurant/bar is pretty loud. At first I found it really annoying, but after a few minutes, I got used to is and it really wasn't an issue.  I would eat here again just for the Shrimp Fettuccini. I would pass on the garlic bread, the Caesar salad, etc.",

    "text": "With 8 guys our here on a golf trip we can always stay on the strip and eat in the hotels upper echelons type places but being adventurous we always try some local places with flavor.  Off we go to this highly reccomended place where locals go to feel old style Vegas with pictures of the rat pack everywhere and a two piece jazz combo play nightly songs from the days gone by.    Arrive and don't know what I was expecting as far as ambiance but it is really nothing much as far as esthetics go here.   Seated a long table and can see this is a problem as the normal tables for 2 persons they have 3 tables for 8 of us having 1/2 the guys on table corners and all squished together.  After a little prodding and the fact we were ready to leave we are moved to a table / booth large enough to accommodate us. Not a good start.   A lot of Vegas locals and kids? At 8PM on a Thursday night.  From gym shorts to nice outfits is the motiff while the majority of the place looks like they just left LA Fitness.  Nice restaurant put on a pair of jeans and get rid of the cutoff sleeveless shirt for god sake.   Wine list is in short Awful. No Value whatsoever, no variety of any substance, what is there has no vintages and anything worth wild is completely overpriced.  Order some wine which takes forever to arrive as hot fresh bread with garlic butter is provided.   Menu is large, diverse and very good looking hope the food makes up for the other issues.  On we go to the food.   Salads Cold Antipasto for 2 $20.00 good, with some meats and cheeses but no top shelf cold cuts here.  For $20.00 you some Procuitto would be nice.   Cesar was pedestrian   $11.00 Stuffed Pepper with meat and cheese, marinara and rice was absolutely Fantastic best meal on the table.   $5.00 sausage and peppers side as an appetizer was delicious   $14.00 shrimp wrapped in Procuitto then baked in filo dough was a don't order again appetizer.   $18.00 Lobster Raviloli were good.   $11.00 Spinach Salad with Honey dressing as good as it gets.   Entrees:   Veal Osso Bucco $43.00 over Risotto with sauce was truly a work of art. (3 of those were consumed)   Basic Chicken Parm was good certainly better options on this menu.   Veal Marsala was fresh tender and tasty as was the Veal Francais.   Seafood Frutte di Marre in White sauce was fantastic, fresh and full of taste.   Stuffed Pork Chops with Procuitto and mozerella were good but not great though the brandy cream Sauce on top was delicious.   Note both bottles of wine were absolutely awful.   Service was OK nothing spectacular while the little band did entertain us with music during our 2 hour meal.   All and all not pricey and food was good to very good. Service was average and atmosphere in my opinion was a little lacking.     All and all a good experience, and certainly may visit again if local, but for 8 guys used to the finer things in life, I certainly believe we can find better venues.",

    "text": "I can't believe how many 5 star reviews are on here. Yelp has failed me for the first time in ever! I tried this place 3 times in about 3 months I started this review in Jan and thought I'll wait.....give it one more try 3rd time's a charm right, it's not, at least in this case. This was from my experience back in February.  I had faith Yelpers! We had a reservation at 8:15 we arrived at 8:17 I know a couple minutes late, but the parking was not convenient, and it took us a minute to walk over there. We gave the girl our name, and waited. and she told us we could wait at the bar, unfortunately my mom cannot be at a bar for personal reason, so we declined, but there was no where to sit or wait. after about 10 minutes I asked when we would be seated and the girl told me 'when we have a table' and told me I could wait at the bar, for a third time now; and at some point the manager walked over and told us we could wait at the bar, and we were in the way; but we couldn't be at the bar and there was no where else for us to be. Well we finally got seated when we started discussing going somewhere else by this time it's 8:45. So Much for reservations. Then there was the awful service, we sat for another 10 minutes before the server came over to get our drink order, and rushed through the specials. and treated us like we were bothering him when we wanted to order an appetizer. Once we did that we didn't see the server for another 15 minutes. And only after I went to the front to ask if he could be sent over because we wanted to order. Finally we did,  the manger delivered it, and asked how everything was. So I told him it was a bit disappointing because of what had happened. He said he would take care of our appetizers for this inconvenience. I asked for fresh grated Parmesan for my gnocci but they don't have that. I thought is was a pretty common thing to ask for in a nice Italian restaurant. Well the food was good, not great, definitely not worth the wait and lack of customer service. At the end of our meal the manager ended up not taking our appitizer off the bill. I thought he must have forgotten considering it was extremely busy. So I told the server he asked the manger and came and told us the manger didn't tell us that. I asked if I could speak to him after waiting another 15 minutes just to speak to the manager he came back and told me there was nothing wrong with their service and he wouldn't be taking anything off the bill. This is what made me decide NEVER again. I didn't ask for anything or expect anything, but don't tell me you're going to do something and then not do it. Especially the manager. Aren't the employees gauging how to treat customers based on their treatment of customers. I did call and complain the next day. But still nothing. No invitation back no offering to give us anything. Nothing but we'll look into this....great.",

Nothing fancy which suits us fine - because this is what an Italian restaurant should be, non-pretentious.  if you've been to Little Italy in NYC, you know what I'm talking about.  We were seated at a table in front of the band that plays soft, easy listening music.  There was a large table near us and they looked like they are from The Sopranos -- awesome!  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the calamari to start - The waiter gave us bruschetta on the house because we waited slightly longer for our calamari but the wait was worth it. Calamari cooked perfectly and was lightly battered ..we have not had it like this since we lived in NYC.  The home-made marinara sauce was perfect!  I had the shrimp fra diavolo - delish!  My bf had spaghetti with meatballs and the marinara sauce - he finished it dry with the bread.  Hey, if you can't find good Italian on the strip, or can't stand waiting on line for dinner, this IS the place to go!!  We will be returning on our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Finally, a place to go in Vegas that's not totally overrun by tourists and has food and atmosphere that rival some of our better restaurants in Chicago.   The decor and ambiance were outstanding. It has a somewhat over the top Rat Pack era Vegas thing going on, which was great. There was a live singer the Saturday night we went. I half expected the ghost of Dean Martin to breeze in the door any second. This restaurant is relatively far off the Strip down East Tropicana but they will purportedly send a limo to pick you up. I didn't see this limo but if it is anything like the decor in this place, you'll most certainly turn a few heads as it picks you up in front of the Bellagio.   The food is traditional Italian. Lots of pasta dishes that you'll probably be very familiar with. Service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and the items we ordered came fast. They ran out of Cannelloni that we ordered and threw in a free desert because of it. Nice. Old school service.  The lasagna they did have was nicely done. Plenty of meat in meat sauce, and cheese in the product. Well seasoned and flavor. It was served at the right temperature - not scalding hot like many lasagna dishes you get.   The eggplant was pan fried and then served with red sauce, cheeses and a side of pasta. It too was very good. Portions are not ridiculously large like they can be in some traditional Italian restaurants like this, which is good because if you're staying in a hotel, you obviously can't take anything home.   If you're staying on the Strip, a trip to the Casa will be a nice way to get away from the tourist throngs for a few hours. A definite thumbs up!",

'open 24 hours' on the huge sign outside.. but 'new hours 4pm...' on the paper on the door. booooo! i couldnt wait.. so i came back on friday. (thats why i knocked off a star).. anyway..  started off with bruschetta and fried ravioli. the tomato on the bruschetta was sooooo refreshing..juicy.. the italian bread was perfectly toasted.. and the cheese was fresh. fried ravioli was not too crispy and the cheese oozed out when you took a bite.. no cardboard tasting ravioli here.. it was good even without the marinara sauce!  i had the fettucine ala moro d'venezio. fettucine pasta with sliced and crumbled sausage with a four cheese sauce... need i say more? the pasta was tasty with all that cheese but the sausage left me speechless. i love sausage.. but not when its too salty. and this was the best sausage i've had in a while... *drool*... the leftovers were even better....  i love the atmosphere in here. friday night... there was a duo singing sinatra among other old vegas style icons.. my friend requested 'young at heart' and got lei'd! lol.. she was summoned to the stage as she sang along and got lei'd... how fun is that! you just gotta bere here to know what im talking about! dim lighting with cushiony booths and a bar in the middle so you dont feel too stuffy in the 'house of love'.. kind of throws it off a bit..but i like it =)",

There was a singer/keyboard player there during dinner, but his music was not too loud or intrusive and he wasn't bad.  I had the rigatoni pesto, which has a flavorful pesto cream sauce, and I enjoyed the house dressing on my salad.  The bread was warm, and the butter appeared to be lightly herbed.  They unfortunately no longer seem to make their desserts in house, so no cannoli for me.  Probably a blessing in disguise, since (and this is unusual for me) I ate the entire large serving of pasta they gave me, and dessert might have pushed me way past too full.",

    "text": "Okay, I'm gonna give them four, but there is a story behind this and its up and down. I planned a very romantic surprise weekend for the wifey in Vegas. I found this place and thought it would be fun with the live music, limo ride, and an escape from the touristy strip. Well, about 30 mins before we were supposed to be picked up I get a phone call indicating that the limo had broken down and we would have to catch a cab for which we would be reimbursed when we got there. This ruined the surprise and was barely apologized for and, if it wasn't already 8:45 on a friday night, I would've tried to get in somewhere else. After a very long and roundabout cab ride, we arrived and were told our table was not ready yet. 15 minutes later we were still waiting and very unhappy, so we told them we were leaving and they called a cab that they would be paying for.   While sitting outside, the manager walked up and apologized for the inconvenience and the unapologetic rudeness of the extremely unprofessional hostess. He told us, \"I don't want you to leave...not like this\" in his best Pauly Cicero voice. He offered to take half off of our bill if we stayed, so we did.   We ordered the hot antipasto sampler ($18) for two which was huge. There was plenty of fried mozarella, ravioli, shrimp and calamari. all of which were good, especially the ravioli! and the marinara, was like nothing I've had since being back in NY. I got the Dei Frutti Di Mare ($26) which was very good. The broth was pretty thin, as it should be, but had great flavor. I really enjoyed this one, lots of seafood. The wifey got the Pasta al Forno ($26), which I bitterly admitted was a little better than my dish, but whatever, they were both very good.   The atmosphere is kind of old, Italian American, somewhat of a stale, used-to-be-filled-with-cigarette-smoke kinda smell. But, honestly if it was really bad, the wifey would not have stayed as she is very, very picky. It was very dark and the music was alright. It was old, Sinatra/rat packish covers from a mildly entertaining fellow that seemed to enjoy his job. It was alright.   The best part was that the manager also slipped us a free entree gift card for a future visit and then they managed to get the limo up and running for our ride back. We did have to share with another couple, but only for the first half of the trip and they were very nice and friendly. the limo was very small and seemed like somewhat of a party limo type of thing, but it was still a nice touch. We might go back, but would make back-up plans in case the limos breaks down again. It is kinda off in the cut in a shadier area.",

I've heard good things about this place and was sure to make reservations as it was a Saturday night. As we walked in, the host informed us they were running 10 minutes behind. It was a nice night so we decided to wait outside. After waiting 30 minutes, we went inside to check and were told there was one party in front of us. After waiting another 15 minutes, we went in to check again and the hostess told us that she had accidentally cancelled our reservation. No apologies were made for the miscommunication at which point we promptly left. I was extremely disappointed by this first impression and living in a town with so many great restaurants, I doubt I will give them a second look.",

    "text": "I joined Susan and a few others for my first Yelp event : an evening (roundtrip) limo ride to Casa di Amore.  The restaurant sends its own branded red limo to pick up customers on the Strip- more fun than a plain old taxi ride. The limo isn't all that big but I'd never been in one before so it was kind of cool playing with the buttons for the \"mood lighting\" and the A/C (and laughing as Susan accidentally found one that suddenly separated us from the driver with a metal partition!). :-)     The restaurant definitely has an old school Vegas feel.  Photographs of Vegas line the walls of the dining room in a chronology, starting with Old Vegas and ending with modern, color photos of the Vegas we see today: gaudy, colorful and sparking! A lounge singer plays the piano and sings old hits such as \"Copacabana\" (he even had backup singers for that one- don't know where the background sound came from!)    Some in our group had a vested interest in a football game. A section towards the back of the restaurant sports lounge seating and widescreen TVs showing at least a couple of football games, so they could easily walk back there for a closer look at the game from time to time.    As a vegetarian/vegan (depends on my mood right now) I was surprised at the paltry salad offerings- I had hoped for a nice big salad for my dinner. Instead, I opted for the small, plain house salad that comes with your order. I chose the penne with greens as my entree (escarole cooked in olive oil). It was very tasty and a bit rich- made me wonder if there was a touch of cheese in it, but I forgot to ask.  Anyway, I had a good time with the charming and funny Yelp crew  (Myke, you are a blast) and enjoyed a nice meal as well.",

I read that this was one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas so we came here under that impression. Having the bar set as high as it can be, the men in my party ordered the chicken and veal parmesan while us girls asked for an antipasto salad, salmon and bruschetta. My date who's half Italian approved the chicken parm with penne pasta! I tried this dish as well and I thought the chicken was moist and tender; the pasta sauce was delicious - over all a great dish!   My antipasto salad was good but a bit too acidic for my taste. Instead, I ate some of he bruschetta and I really enjoyed those.   It can get really loud in here once the live music starts so if you want to eat and talk, perhaps you should show up before 6:30 pm.",

My last time here I came with a group of 19 people. I called a week ahead of time to reserve our table. Another awesome perk of this place is that they provide free transportation from the strip in their limos. I had already known about the limos which is why I called so early to reserve them. We were all able to meet at the main valet of our casino and ride together to dinner. We got to the restaurant and our tables were ready. The food was quick to come out and was delicious.

It also was quite loud because there was a large party in there of about 25 people and they also have live music playing through dinner. I loved the music I thought it was a nice touch to have some entertainment so you could take your time and eat dinner. The pasta was very good but the bread that most yelpers recommended was not anything to rave about. It actually reminded me of breadsticks from Pizza Hut so I guess if you're in to those..then try it. I actually did not take any pictures because I was too excited to eat that the pics were an after thought! Sorry :) but I would recommend the fettuccine Alfredo and a side of the meatballs! I didn't have room for dessert because I started with a house salad which was also very good. One of the best things about this place is they have a shuttle that will transport you to and from your local hotel but you have to book in advance because it fills up quick! The prices were not much cheaper than anything you can get on the strip but it was still nice to venture out and check out what the rest of Vegas has to offer.",

The motto of this place is \"Vegas the way it used to be.\" We had a party of four that arrived around midnight; this place is open till five. I had cioppino which was really good, others in my party had different things but I was too engrossed in my cioppino to care! Wine on Monday is half-price and the place was packed. I think there were four or five birthday parties here, including one with little kids. They have a two piece band, both of whom sang and doubled on multiple instruments.thank Frank Sinatra meets funk and a little New Orleans thrown in. They rocked, the food rocked, the waiters were great, what a totally cool place. It is about two or 3 miles from the strip, so you see a mix of locals as well as well informed visitors. If you decide to come, be prepared to have a really good time.",

    "text": "Casa di Amore was recommended to us and is a great example of authentic Italian food prepared like Grandma cooked back in the old country.  We dined as a party of four adults.  There was a tasty gluten free penne for one of us (she ate every bite!).  Another ordered the baked mostaccioli and it was also tasty and filling.  I wanted the Linguini with Clams but chose the Frutti Di Mare instead.  It was excellent.  Others in my party agreed it was the best choice at our table, although everything we ordered was flavorful.  Before dinner, we enjoyed the calamari appetizer with marinara sauce.  Simply awesome!  Complimentary table bread was never offered, which is odd for an authentic Italian restaurant.  So we ordered garlic bread but didn't know it is made with melted cheese on it.  It tastes really good, but one of us could not eat cheese so we needed to order a second one minus the cheese.   Our reservations were at 5:15pm, just after opening, so the restaurant was fairly empty.  They accommodated us to sit in a booth where we could watch the LA Kings play in the NHL finals during dinner.  Our server \"Toni\" was fun and attentive.   The restaurant is quite a distance from the Strip so they offer a pick-up service, which is convenient if you don't have your own vehicle.  The driver was right on schedule picking us up and \"Sig\" drove us to/from safely.  The wait to leave by limo was longer than expected, but we still made it to a show at the MGM on time.  Don't expect top of the line limousines.  For a driver gratuity of $3-5 per person, it is better than a taxi ride!  If craving good, authentic Italian food, we would eat there again while visiting Las Vegas.",

The bread was great with some oil and vinegar.  We had the Lasagna and Eggplant di amor. Both with fairly dry and we had the server bring us some more marinara and it still didn't do it :(   All in all we did have the creme brulee for dessert. It is homemade and was delicious!!   The service, bread, and creme brulee are great but if you plan to have a good on entree based on what I had (which is said to be the favorites)  I would not recommend this place  Ps: the live music and the low lit he ambience is awesome so if you're looking just for a date and not worrying about food or for late-night pizza it would be fine",

    "text": "This was our favorite dinner in Vegas!  We went based on Yelp and Tripadvisor reviews- so glad I did my research, or I NEVER would have found this spot.  We took a cab (didn't know about the complimentary limo service!) and I started to wonder where the hell we were going- it was a 20.00 cab ride from the strip.  When we finally got there, the cabbie said we shouldn't have a problem getting back because the machine gun range next door was very popular with the tourists...  We walked in and were promptly seated by the hostess, who told us that the musician was taking a break but would be back soon (singing keyboard player who interacted w/willing dinner guests). Our server was extremely helpful and luckily, we were there on 1/2 priced wine night (Sun and Mon) so we got an excellent Chianti.    We started off w/the calamari, which was wonderful and there was a ton of it!  It was very crisp and had a lovely marinara sauce.  I had the 'grandma's' soup, which was delicious- chicken noodle-y and very flavorful.  I was in the mood for red sauce, so the server recommended a sausage pasta dish that was normally served w/a pink sauce, but said he'd make it w/red (amazing!!!)  My husband had a strip steak which was served w/a twice baked potato and veggie...all good.   When it was time for desert, we declined- but our server said we had to try the cannoli and we'd get a t-shirt...I'm a sucker for a free t, so we got it to go.   The server told us about the limo service and said that the driver was off because nothing had been scheduled- but that his manager was more than happy to take us to our hotel.  We took him up on the offer and rode back to the strip in style.    I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone, in fact, I gave away the card our server gave us w/his name on it (Christopher?) to another trade show attendee.  Sorry that I can't give his name, because he was great!  Later, while walking down the strip, we passed a particularly hungry looking homeless guy.  I asked if he was hungry, he said he was starving...I offered him our leftovers.  He happily took them and was very grateful.  About 3 minutes later, I realized I'd given away my souvenir t-shirt, but I bet he needed it more than I did.",

Tight quarters to say the least. Our server was Toni from Brooklyn and she was FABULOUS!! Made us feel like we were part of her family. It was loud to begin with and to top it off there was a server ( male ) tall guy that was extremely loud with his table next to us and he took about a dozen pictures constantly bumping us. At the end of the dinner, an African American man came over and asked us how everything was. We still don't know who he was as he never identified himself. Very creepy!! Kept staring at us.

    "text": "It's funny that I went here after I watched the Anthony Bourdain where he bemoans the trend of traditional Italian-AMERICAN food disappearing, as it dissolves into a mishmash of regional cuisines of Italy. Is there something shameful about a veal parm? Not in my book, and not in Bourdain's either.  Old school, dark walls, candles on the table. I also had the pleasure of watching the Godfather on AMC's mob week before I went here, so it was awesome seeing pictures of old Vegas like the Sands with Dino and Frankie on the marquee. They send a limo to pick you up, and all you have to do is tip the driver.   Onto the food! Well first the wine. Their wine list was surprisingly pricey, but the cheap 30 dollar chianti was a solid pick. The bread was uninspired, the butter clearly pre-frozen. I ordered the pork chop saltimbucca, half order, because TWO 8oz pork chops is a little too much. It was pretty good, a little salty. My friends ordered lasagna, fettuccine, eggplant parm. I tried all of them, and while it's nice to have these italian american classics around, I could have made these at home for half the price, easy. However, it's a solid place and I liked that it was off the strip and not touristy as hell.",

    "text": "Decided to go here based on reviews on Trip Advisor (instead of my original choice of Batista's Hole In The Wall), plus the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate, plus the fact they pick you up in a limo if you make reservations over the phone far enough in advance was what helped us make the decision to eat at Casa Di Amore.   I arranged to have the limo pick us up at the Rio after \"The Rat Pack Is Back\" show (after the meal, he returned us to the hotel we were staying at, the Flamingo). Neither my mom or I had ever had a limo ride, so this was a good treat. The driver was nice and very chatty.  When we got inside Casa Di Amore, the hostess took my name but acted like I hadn't made a reservation. Although it was Mother's Day, it was a Sunday night, at 10pm, and it was not busy, several tables were empty, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes. The entertainment was just packing up, so we missed that completely :-/  Our waiter (I think his name was Bradley) was not very nice, in fact, he was a bit of a jerk. He was really short with us the entire time, and made several rude remarks to me.I think he saw my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate, and every restaurant we went to on this trip and used one of these, we got poor service from the waitstaff (which is ironic since they are guaranteed a bigger tip with one of these certificates)  I have a lot of indigestion issues, and basil doesn't agree with me, so when at Italian restaurants I always order regular spaghetti w/ marinara sauce. I've never had an issue. But, this sauce had large strands of basil, as well as small chopped pieces of it. Also, the portion was puny, maybe about 1 cup of cooked noodles.  My mom got spaghetti w/ meat sauce and meatballs. Her plate had a HEAPING portion of food. I know she had meat sauce and meatballs, but there really shouldn't have been that big of a difference between our portion sizes.   Anyway, I notice all the basil on my food and immediately start the long process of picking it out with my fork. I haven't even taken a bite when the waiter noticed and asks how our meal is, my mom asks him if they have a sauce w/o so much basil, even asks for the sauce from the kids menu, but he tells us this is their plainest sauce. He then tells me that he can swap it out for something else, but what else is there if this is their plainest sauce?   I go on, and try to eat my spaghetti. I take a bite, and follow it with several gulps of water. My mouth HURTS. In the next 15 minutes I go on to take 3 more bites, but each one is more excruciating than the next. I feel like my lips are on fire. Waiter comes up to us again and asks how everything is, and I tell him I just cannot eat the food in front of me.   He tells me, \"you should have said something when I asked earlier.\" He pointed to my food, which originally was just about 1 cup of cooked noodles and I had only eat 4 small bites, and went on to say, \"its obvious you ate most the meal. What do you expect me to do? I can get my manager out, and I KNOW what he will say.\"  I argue that I only ate 4 small bites, and my mom steps in asking if I could just get a small side order of plain noodles, then I chime in that I want no sauce that I'll just put a little parmesan on top. He says he can do that, but I'll be charged for it. What else can I do, I'm hungry.   He brought it, and I ate it just the way I said I would. It was fine, but I was still hungry, so I ordered Creme Brulee (& which comes with a free t-shirt). The Creme Brulee was good, still warm so I waited a minute or two or else the top wouldn't break just right.   When he brought the check he pointed out my original meal's costs, then the side of noodle's cost, then he pointed out that he took off the cost of the noodle side, saying \"Because I'm just a nice guy\". Listen, when someone -- especially a waiter -- tells me that he's a nice guy because he's doing something that just basic customer service, you know they are just another jerk. Then he goes on to say, again, \"if I had told any of this to my manager, he would have charged you for that side. But, I'm saving you the trouble. I'm just nice like that.\"  The funny thing is, as I was paying the bill, my mom was outside smoking with the manager, and she said he was really nice. There's no way he would have charged me for that little side when I barely touched my meal.  The only time our waiter was truly nice to use was right before we left, when he saw me taking photos of the canvases of old Vegas, and he offered to take a couple of pictures of me & my mom. And when he brought my free t-shirt out, he brought several sizes so I could compare. That was the nicest he was the entire time we were there.  I would go there again, for the limo ride and the atmosphere -- but not the food -- I'd go there for drinks and dessert, and watch my friends or family enjoy their meal, then I'd grab a bite at my hotel afterwards...",

The manager didn't charge us a corking fee to open my husbands gift of crown royal since the bar was closed and they were fantastic in serving the cake that I had dropped off. We come here at least once every few months. The food is fantastic! Very friendly server and very attentive!",

    "text": "Fantastic in everyway! The food is excellent with a diverse menu of Italian Dishes. Great appetizers, many choices of Italian Style Chicken, Steak, Seafood, Pork and of course pasta classics. Everything is fresh  from the pasta to the seafood. Fresh french bread is served while your waiting for your order. Classic \"Old Las Vegas Vibe\" in the decor,  music and atmosphere. They even have a live band. My husband and I were so full we could even consider dessert from their array of dessert choices. We had enough to take home to have for dinner tonight!  He had the Veal Parmigiano the Shrimp Al Diablo. Both served with linguine with homemade sauce. This is definitely a gem in Las Vegas. We are locals who will  continue to go again and again! The staff is fantastic as well. Perfect for a special occasion or just because you want great food.",

The good....The restaurant is far enough from the strip to avoid a majority of the tourists, but not too far where the cab ride will be more than a couple of glasses of wine. We walked into the restaurant and man was this place packed, but not a touristy, crazy, I gotta get outta here packed. It literally felt like I walked into a scene from \"The Casino\". Family and friends were sitting at tightly packed tables chatting and laughing, a live two man band was against the wall belting tunes and the walls reflected old school Vegas pics. MY KINDA PLACE, I WAS AT HOME!  The bad...My three person party walked in for our RESERVATION, told it would be a few minutes, so made our way to the bar. The first 45 minutes of waiting was not too bad, but as our wait dragged into over and hour it was clear that people were just not leaving their tables (and why would they when the wine is flowing and fun is being had). The bar and walls around the bar were packed with other parties waiting....waiting......waiting. After a couple of advances to the hostess station and getting the \"15 minutes\" \"15 minutes\" line, we were finally sat after about an hour and a half wait. The worst of the worst was when the waitress came to the table and commented to us as if we had multiple heads \"So, you guys have been waiting a long time\", no apologies.   The average....The food and the service. Nothing much to wait an hour and a half for.   Thoughts...If you have a big party or can get in without a long wait, the ambiance is worth it.",

I called asking if we they would have room for us in about 30 minutes. They said they would try their best but can't guarantee all the tables will open up. We arrived in 20 minutes and they were all ready for us! Our dinner here was one we will never forget! The staff was so friendly, the waiters and waitresses were extremely accommodating to our large group, the food was amazing. THE SINGERS! They sang some Chicago songs specifically for us as we are from Chicago and even let one of us get up there and sing a song too! Definitely some of the best service we have received. Would recommend to anyone!",

    "text": "I never have a bad experience here and I think that is more because of the amazing service than the amazing food.   My girlfriend and a friend of ours stopped in here on Saturday night after a long day of baby shower planning/shopping. We didn't even realize it was Saturday night at prime time (6:00 p.m.) until we walked inside and the place was PACKED. There was a wedding reception being held as well as regular dining reservations. We didn't have a reservation, but the manager came over and said, \"You can have this booth but you guys have to be done by 7:30, and that should give you plenty of time. Does that work?\"  OF COURSE IT WORKS.   We got the garlic bread loaf (heavenly) and I got a Caesar Salad to start. Yum! I love their dressing!!!!! I ordered the special for the evening - Lobster ravioli (tossed in Vodka sauce) and it was perfect. It came with NINE HUGE ravioli stuffed to the brim with deliciously fresh lobster meat. The sauce tasted great too, and I know my vodka sauce - trust me! ;)  My gf got the chicken parm and she almost finished the whole thing. That's how you know something is good! I had a few bites and really liked that the chicken was moist but not too thick! Our friend got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and she barely even looked up from her plate before she finished eating. So, I'm assuming it was perfect.   Overall, I give the food a 4.5 (it's not THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN THE WORLD but it is VERY GOOD) but the service gets a 5++++ star rating. Brad, our server, was on his toes all night. He had recommendations, explained the menu, was friendly, never let any of our drinks get even close to empty, and had things taken care of before we even needed to ask. Thanks, Brad.   I like that this place is away from the strip and I really love how dark it is inside. There's usually live music in the form of a 50's era style crooner and the decorations are flawless. Stone brick wall - PERFECTION.   Check it out!!",

Everyone was super friendly and appeared to be helping each other out to serve food, refill drinks and clear tables. Even with that, it was still clear who our waitress was and she was super attentive to our needs and was very knowledgeable about the menu and daily specials. I believe her name was Joanne, so kudos to her! She's awesome! The food is here is amazing! I tried the ravioli, but based on the menu, I don't think you can order something \"not good\" here. The cocktails are also well-made and they certainly don't short you on the liquor. Even the pre-dinner bread is good! :) The manager was present the entire evening and was talking with folks as well as stopping at tables to check on people. He was very nice and welcoming. The live music is also a great bonus to this place! I will absolutely be back here and rant and rave to anyone traveling to Vegas to dine here. As another reviewer said, it is worth the drive from the strip (I believe they also do transportation, but call ahead!) and you should not leave Vegas without dining here. I second that!",

I love the Chicken Alfredo and the cup of homemade chicken soup. I've brought my family here, and even my picky nephew loved their spaghetti when he usually doesn't eat restaurant food. Since I've had food at Casa Di Amore, I have gone to other Italian restaurants and do not enjoy the food as much anymore because I end up missing the taste of Casa Di Amore's food. The music is also great! Come here, you won't regret it! (:",

The food is old school Italian, which I very much enjoy. The front of the house staff is second to none. Plus, the whole place is like traveling back in time! My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of our waitress. We had a large party, and had warned her we would be splitting the tab... She said, \"no problem, I'll print multiple receipts so everyone can circle what they had.\" So we do this, and she cops major attitude because we gave her 5 cards (NOTE: I know this is annoying for a server, but she said it was fine when asked about it). We proceeded to wait for a full 30 MINUTES for our checks to sign! The night had been perfect for me up to that point, and I'm sad it ended on a crappier note. None-the-less, you (review reader) should DEFINITELY go here! Especially if you like nostalgia; this place is very much for you ;).",

The service was excellent.  Every member of the staff we encountered was professional, knowledgable, and personable.  The food, while overpriced, was still very good.  I ordered the half serving of the stuffed pork chops and it was very tasty.  The cannoli for desert was very good as well.  Others at our table ordered a wide variety of items, to which the consensus was the food was great.   So, really you are paying for the ambiance and the service.  The interior of the restaurant is dark and has an old school feel to it, which to me is awesome.  The only sticking point is the prices on the menu, where I feel you can absolutely get food at least as good at other places for a better value.  I will go to Casa Di Amore now once in a while to change things up, but not as my mainstay italian restaurant on town.",

We did as bid, and \"won\" our part of our dinner check at the video games in the lounge.  How much better can it get?  Much, much, better!!!  Once our attention was drawn to the actual restaurant, we discovered wonderful photos, melodious melodies by famous crooners, ie., ole Blue Eyes.  Wine selection: excellent, ceasar salad: excellent, chicken marsala;delicious, Sad, but, okay: pork chop ala Italiano: tough.  Service: more than excellent.

Another couple even got engaged that night while we were there!  The waitstaff was patient and sweet with our large party. Our children were treated wonderfully.  The band was fantastic and the bandleader took the time to speak to me and my new husband personally and was so sweet as to ask for song requests. WE LOVED IT!

Tony was a really nice guy and gave us some information about the restaurant since it was our first time dining here.  When we get there we were greeted almost immediately by our waiter, another Tony. He was friendly and offered recommendations for both wine and entrees. This place is OLD school Vegas. Dark, red booths, a guy with a keyboard singing some Sinatra, Dean Martin and the like. I got the peppercorn steak as this was a recommendation by Tony. My clients got the Osso Bucco and a pasta dish. We were STUFFED as the portions were HUGE! Not only huge, a lot of love is put into these dishes. Great food, great service, great ambiance! I went outside to make a phone call and talked to some people outside who were locals who dined here regularly. Locals and out of towners alike are treated like royalty. There is nothing better than a great meal with great service and GREAT people taking care of you. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back on future Vegas trips.",

They are a little messy as far as menu's being dirty etc. very slow at seating even with reservation. the price point is about 5.00 too much for everything. However the good parts - For a neighborhood place you cant get better Italian than this.I have been 4 times now All the food minus the house salad is absolutely excellent. They do a killer Burrata cheese appetizer. The pork chop with peppers is exceptional! Amazing acid and great spice. cool ambiance old school style. The waiters are not top notch by any means but friendly and they try. So far there is not a better quasi - budget Italian place in town.",

There is \"live entertainment\" which is a guy or  2 on a small stage playing keyboard and eye fucking every woman under 65. Thats right ladies, he's lookin for love! Funny thing is, he has groupies...sad sad groupies throwing back wine like nobody's business. The pizza is good, the bartenders are cuties, you can get pretty crazy there and it's cool.

You feel like you've stepped back in time and that a member of the Rat Pack could walk in any moment.  The service was wonderful. The server made sure to bring my friend a birthday drink, made great suggestions and made us laugh a lot.  And the food was delicious.  We split two bowls of pasta and a salad between three women and were absolutely stuffed.   The wine list is terrific too.  Then cannelloni for dessert which I couldn't eat because I was too full but my friends said it was divine.  This will definitely be our go-to place when we visit Vegas. It was great to be off the strip and hang out around locals.  Plus the band is here is FABULOUS.",

Four of us came her to check out the place (first timer's) was thinking of maybe booking it for a dinner reception after our wedding next year. We all shared two entree's (cus it was pretty late to be eating Italian food) and two side salads and bread. The lasagna was really yummy, we ordered some chicken dish i cant remember the name but none of us cared for it the chicken was a little dry, but the pasta it was served with was good.  The entertainment was alright not as exiting as all the other yelp'ers made it come across. Maybe we came too late?? Anyways we will be back, but i don't think we will be booking our dinner reception here afterall, only because it is away from the Strip and i think i would prefer more of a banquet hall facility.",

He told us about the !/2 price wine bottles.. We ordered a penot noir form oregon that wsa great. He told us about the specials and one of them jumped right out for me. Tenderloins with gnocchi in a white gorganzola sauce. I odered that and my girlfriend ordered a penne and veggie dish adding sausage to he. Both dishes had great flavor to them. we started off with the \"prawns\". Never tasted shrimp like that. perfectly baked. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but still worth adding on. The mussels in marinera were so good we were dipping our bread in to eat like a soup. Having eaten a whole lot didnt have much for desert. but when Tony informed me that its shipped from italy and light, I had to try the cherry bomba. He was on the money again. Full and happy we hung out for a few and listened to music. not once did it feel like they were trying to get us out the door. perfect setting. Even better service. I highly recommend this place.

We were in Vegas on a family trip this past weekend where we rented a house- 7 couples and 5 kids (all under 3!).  For girls night out we hooked up the 'puter and checked out yelp for something close.  Casa Di Amore was close, Italian, and had good reviews.  We were dropped off by one of the hubbies and were going to have the staff call us a cab- but low and behold- they have a limo!!! We asked if they could take us the the strip after dinner and they could!  It was really fun AND the food was so good.  We had a few bottles of wine and the bill was still under $40 a person.  Plus, they gave us each a rose AND there was a lounge singer.  We felt like we were in a movie (Swingers was mentioned more than once).  What more could a group of hot mamas ask for?  I recommend this place if you are looking for something away from the crowds where you and your group can have a nice meal for a reasonable price.",

Downside? had to wait just a bit for our table but it was worth it.

We loved it! We got picked up by complimentary limo and whisked to the restaurant like we were special visiting family from out of town. The Sunday and Monday 1/2 price bottles of wine are an excellent value especially with large groups. The antipasto platters were a big hit as well as the appetizers...there were forks flying back and forth; I expected sparks! The stuffed portobello special that night was to die for good. The portions are little large, but hey, it was our first night in Las Vegas and airplane food is non existent these days... My seafood pasta was tasty but the mollusks were a bit gritty and there was some broken shell pieces....quite the surprise to bite down on a crunchy shell that you thought was a piece of mussel....the lighting is very dim. But I just ordered another bottle of Barbera and moved on.... My husband's pork chops were excellent, but he is picky about his cheese, so the fontina was not to his taste....but I just ordered another bottle of Barbera and he moved on.... The rest of the group ate, drank and enjoyed their meal immensely while being serenaded by the keyboardist....who kept mentioning it was my birthday....but I just ordered another bottle of Barbera and, so do you see where this is going? It got a little raucus....mea culpa Tony (our waiter). The complimentary tiramisu they sent over for my birthday was excellent, and the creme brulee done to perfection (most brulees are overcooked like a custard; this was creamy and fragrant with vanilla bean). If you want authentic Itatlian gourmet, then go someplace that charges for the tap water and you can wear your cruisewear. But if you want good, honest food that is the a product of the evolution of Italian immigrants making  American ingredients their own, then you gotta try Casa di Amore. Did I mention they have Barbera?",

Casa di Amore is one of those establishments that has a real connection to Vegas' past, but lacks the pretention of those other joints. Everyone here, from staff to management to the customers who make Casa di Amore their regular stop, is genuinely low key and laid back. They're far more interested in making sure you enjoy yourself with some old-time Vegas than trying to pretend they are some big shot from the glory days.  The food is exactly as good as you expect and never let's you down. The price point is extremely reasonable, especially on half price wine bottle night.   Stop in and you'll be made to fell at home - with a great meal and a fabulous experience.",

I'm pretty sure we will be back every time were in Vegas. We started with the Calamari and Bruschetta. I recommend both. For our main courses we had the Veal Parm (based on our servers recommendation)... Great choice! And we had the Cioppino.. Loaded with goodness, it was delicious!",

Brad was our waiter and was awesome!! He made sure to explain all the dishes, recommendations and even took the initiative to take a picture of the group without us asking!   The music was great with one singer sounding exactly like Frank Sinatra!!!  The restaurant is great for everyone from young professionals to senior citizens!!  This restaurant was such a great time that we didn't even know we were there for 3 hours!! They also provide limo rides from the strip and back which makes you feel like a high ranking boss. I'm from Vegas but whenever I have friends come in from out of town I'm making it my mission to have dinner at Casa Di Amore!! Also, if you order the creme brulee or cannolli they give you a tshirt that has the famous Godfather quote \"leave the gun...take the cannolli\" which is awesome. My wife and I can't wait to come back!!!",

    "text": "My husband and our friends were headed to Vegas with some friends to celebrate our 15th anniversary. We wanted to try something authentic and off the strip and I looked at Yelp and found this place.  Since I had never been in a limo I was quite excited that they provide free limo service to and from their restaurant.  We were picked up promptly at 6 at the MGM for our reservation at 6:15.  We were sat immediately and greeted by a very pleasant server (Lynn?) She was very attentive at first but as the restaurant filled up we saw her less and less and seemed like were an annoyance when we asked for something.    Drinks were very good, so was the bread. My gnocchi pancetta was TOOOO good.  Amazing really. I have had a lot of gnocchi and this was obviously made fresh.  Husband had fettucine and said \"meh\".  Couple with us had lobster ravioli, he said the sauce overpowered the lobster but that it was still good. They also had steak and it was the best steak i have ever tasted. It actually melted in your mouth. Thankfully it was big enough for her to share :)  We had canole and creme brule for desert.  I have had much better creme brule.  I wasnt impressed.  The canole was pretty tasty tho.  The ambiance is really great. It has the feel of old 50' s mobster style Vegas. Red paint and bricks. Just cool. The live band was awesome and really set the tone singing Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  So where does the star fall off of a 5 star rating?  When we went to pay the bill I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate (which by the way is a rip - dont use them....lots of hidden fees and rules - pain in the butt).  I gave it tand my credit card for the remaining balance to the server and she disappeared. She brought back a receipt and our friends bill which they paid.  I was confused that I didnt have a receipt for my credit card and tracked her down because she was not coming back to our table. I asked if the bill was settled and she said it was and said goodbye.  The limo driver then drove us to the strip. Half way there we were basking in the great meal and mood of being in a limo and satiated.  When the phone rang. I could hear the limo driver talking about an unpaid bill.  He asked me if  we had paid and I assured him that we had.  He argued with someone on the phone and then handed me his cell phone.  The guy on the other end asked if we had paid and I told him what had happened and said the server confirmed we had paid.  He said for some reason she didnt run our card and therefore I gave him the card info again over the phone.  I did not appreciate the insinuation that we were dining and dashing, especially since we were obviously taking THEIR limo back to the strip.  WTH?  I also didnt appreciate the server not taking responsibility for her mistake and then putting the issue on us while we were trying to enjoy our limo ride back to the strip. I spent 5 of the 10 minutes on the phone with the staff working out payment.  I think they need more servers because our server was fantastic and then when it got busy we barely saw her and this mistake occurred, surely because she was busy.  Still obnoxious.  All told, we would go back but I really was pissed about the payment issue.",

Spicy lovers, do the Gypsy sauce if you can handle it. They have delicious veggie meatballs.....but you have to pay extra for them......only sometimes.

I try something different everytime, but I might not anymore!) variety of seafoods including shrimp, scallops,muscles,clams and calamari in choice of red or white sauce traditionally served over linguini.(Substituted the pasta for GNOCCHI for 5.00+)  We didn't order dessert but if you do you also get a FREE Casa di Amore t-shirt (with specific desserts) They also offer FREE limo-rides. Might have to take them up on this offer soon.  PLUS amazing entertainment (Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin our Favorties!)  and top notch service will keep us coming back.

    "text": "I am not sure which good thing to say first, since the entire visit was amazing. I made reservations a couple of weeks before our visit since we would be in town for a few days. This was no ordinary day for us, we were renewing our vows after 25 years and didn't want to go to just any restaurant. We wanted to go somewhere special. Casa Di Amore was definitely that. We arrived still dressed from the big day. We were greeted by multiple members of the staff and congratulated over and over. Even many of the locals (we knew they were locals because you could tell this was their local place to go to eat) stopped by to talk with us.   We were seated near the entertainment and had a great view of them playing and singing. The food was AMAZING. I had the salmon and it was probably one of the best salmon dishes that I have ever had. My husband had the chicken marsala and he finished the dish and loved it.   The staff went out of their way to ensure we were having a good time and that we were recognized for our special night. So much so that they had the band announce our names and why were there (to which the rest of the restaurant gave a round of applause and their congratulations, some even stopping by the table) and the band played a song just for us.   I cannot say enough good things about this place. Please do yourself a favor and get off of the strip, eat at a local place and have an amazing time. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town.",

The Caesar salad was delicious too. Only complaint I have is, it does get pretty loud and busy so it's probably not a place for an intimate dining experience. All of my party enjoyed their dish except for one person who ordered their special sea bass. She said it tasted frozen and didn't like it too much, especially for a $40 dish. However, I was pleased and will definitely come back in the future.",

The atmosphere kinda reminded me of a nice italian places where a mafia family might have a meeting in the corner table while listening to some amazing live jazz music. (did that make sense?)  The appetizer/entree were both great and the owner/manager even stopped by to say hello and chatted with us for a bit to make sure we were enjoying our dinner.  We were too full to try the dessert so maybe we'll get a chance to try it out next time. All in all, a great dinner experience and will be back here the next time in town.  Great to take a date. Also good to take family, friends, coworkers, and customers.  Recommend making a reservation b/c it started getting pretty busy after 6:30pm when we were there.",

Lots of pseudo places, wanna be homemade spots try to mimic a great Italian flavor but fail tremendously. That is why I am so glad Casa di amore is still around  The ambiance of the place is great. The tables, the little stage with life performance, the bar and the service reminds me of NYC or san Francisco. Lightinig is very soft making the experience a mix between romantic and sexy.  The food is great as well!. The bruchettas are fresh and tasty and the consistencyof the calamari was great. The antipasto portion is pretty big and presentation is great as well. FYI, their bread and butter is AMAZING..just be carefull you end up like me and eat too much of it .  The entrees were as impressive as the appetizer. My lasagna tasted like homemade, and my friends white sauce seafood pasta was good. We noted that the noodles were a little on the plain side, but the sauces and seafood were able to share some of its flavor with it  Some days this place has some specials on wines . Be sure to ask your server about those before ordering. You might be able to save some money.  If you still have room for desert. Try the Tiramisu or caneloni. Freshly made and packed with flavor.  Hasta la pasta!",

My major gripe is being told I cannot sub a menu item without being charged extra.....or if I was here for swing shift they wouldn't even entertain the thought of a special order.   My specific case was wanting a meatball sub with meatless meatballs. The chef (NOT the batender who was nice) said they will have to charge me an extra $3 for the substution. Mind you, they are the same price on the menu.  It just left a bad taste in my mouth, but the superb food has had me back since then and I enjoyed it immensely.  Its unfortunate that one incident has left me hesitant to return and their policy of letting the chef run the show instead of paying customers sucks....but if you can stomach the 'no special orders' policy you will be just fine here.   On a side note, the video poker there is quite stingy. All I do is lose, lose, lose. Not even in a fun, i win a little and give it all back sort of way. I straight up lose hard and fast.",

    "text": "This place is awesome for a date night! ;)    I stumbled across a review for Casa di Amore reviewed by another yelper Karlie G-and decided to try Casa. I had a wickedly wonderful female coming to visit me from LA that I adore visiting me last weekend, and wanted a place to take her that was romantic and cozy-and not on the strip.   Checked  the website after reading the review-free complimentary limo ride if you have a reservation for dinner?!?! Yes PLEASE! Called the number on the website (you can't get the limo through normal website reservations) with the only requirement being you have have to be picked up from a hotel. Perrrfect!  I could drink with my date!  The person I talked to-Phil, Paul? I can't remember was super cool, had a pleasant demeanor, had me scheduled in no time flat to be picked up from palace station 15 mins before our reservation, thanked me for choosing casa and even put in a request in my request for a booth.   Our limo driver Byron picked us up right on time He introduced himself, was pleasant, opened our doors for we were on our way!   Arrived around 7 at Casa Di Amore, and was wondering what to do with my wine glasses and my other bottle of wine we hadn't finished. Byron took anything I didn't want to carry and put it in his trunk and we proceeded right inside-carrying our wine glasses from earlier straight in with us.   Greeted by a super cute, and courteous door girl, I didn't catch her name she was keeping the circus in check around her and doing a great job. She smiled as soon as we came in, and I think she even knew my name as soon as I walked in even though I had never been there before based on the time I walked in and my party size! Nice! What a pro!   Walk in and the atmosphere blew me away!  The place is not huge by any means, but it just big enough to have an organzied chaos and frenzy of laughter, the smell of italian food, servers zipping about-the kind of place that makes you feel cozy and warm.   Our seats were not ready yet, so they politely asked us to wait in the lounge area near the bar and Byron took led us to the back. We were still drinking our wine, not a thing said by anyone carrying in our own wine glass-double Nice!  A really good lounge singer was belting out some classics and originals and a keyboard player was right in sync with him-he was working hard for the money on the intimate little stage right in the middle of the place. It was just the right loudness to fill the room, without drowning out the conversations people were having.   We sat for 10-15 minutes, I lost track due to the wine and a little buzzed, but the atmosphere was so enjoyable we didn't even notice. .  A few minutes later we were seated. Our server showed up right away with water's with lemons in them nice and chilly. We got a HUGE 6-8 person booth I requested for the just the two of us-even though the place was packed on a Saturday night-Kudos Casa!  Our server, who was a really nice blonde, asked us about appetizers, but we skipped that figuring we'd get bread and I had read the portions were large.   I ordered the Lobster Ravioli without looking as the rest of the menu, my date ordered the triple cheese pasta and we ordered a bottle of Cabernet. Everything on the menu was priced reasonably as were the bottles of wine.   I'm almost out tryping room, so I'll wrap it up.  I agree with Karlie G-The food was an excellent 4 stars-but the service was 5! -the ambiance a& atmosphere-outstanding. I'd tell you more about the night... but we finished the second bottle...and its a lil fuzzy-aint gonna lie. Never ending Bread basket, 2 Caeser Salads and 2 Entrees and a bottle of wine with tip about $100-not too shabby at all- Everything else melted away staring into the eyes of my companion...and it's the perfect place to do so- Ill be back for sure. ; ) Thanks Casa!",

    "text": "I came here with my friend one night before we went to a show on the strip. It was ok, but nothing to write home about (just yelp about!).   We started off with the bruschetta, and it was probably one of the best that I've ever had. It's not super hard to make this, but it was still delicious. For the main course I got the osso bucco which is supposed to be a favorite, but I wasn't thrilled. The risotto was overcooked and didn't have any flavor. Even adding salt did nothing for it. The meat wasn't even as tender as I've had before. The tomato sauce was good, but then again, it's tomato sauce. If you're messing that up, then you should be making Italian food. My friend got the eggplant parmesan, and she really enjoyed it. Again, she said it wasn't the best, but not bad either.   The dessert was weird. We got the dream bomba, which was SUPPOSED to be peanut butter ice cream, with a caramel center. Well, there was no caramel center, so we just ended up with peanut butter ice cream. Again, it was fine, but it wasn't as described, and it was just ice cream, nothing special. I wouldn't come back here, and I probably would recommend this to a friend. I can think of 5 other Italian restaurants I'd rather spend my money at.",

The food was to die for and I'm already counting the days until I can make it back to Vegas to eat here again. They also offer free limo service to people staying on the strip which made it even more worth it. There's no excuse not  to go here while you're in Vegas. Make your reservation now!!

I think his name is Nick (white male, bald spot, round belly) I asked him when the bread will be ready because we have been waiting quite a while, he said, \" You'll get it when it's ready\" The restaurant wasn't that crowded. His day was probably bad and just took it out on me. He didn't need to be like that.",

They have live bands playing and they do fun songs that you can really get into, they sung some Sinatra and it was awesome. The band members come by and talk to you on their breaks and you all become family. Atmosphere is darker, more \"Romantic\" \"relaxing\" type of setting.. definitely old school Vegas with pictures of celebrities  all over the restaurant.   the food is PERFETTO! My favorite dish is the  Gnocchi Alla Prosciutto. I get it every time! Great wine and drink list. Service is fantastic even when they're crazy busy. You HAVE to get the cannoli's! FANTASTIC! (You even get a free shirt with it.)   If you're staying on the strip ride in their complimentary limo! Very clean and did I mention... COMPLITMENTARY?? No nasty expensive cab ride, and it's nice to get off the Strip for a bit.  I do recommend making reservations (at least for the weekend) because they get crowded fast for dinner time (Hint: make reservations online for easy and fast booking..but if you want a limo you do have to call).  As far as attire goes, you can either dress up or dress casual (I always go for some type of special occasion so I'm dressed up, and no you won't feel out of place.) Great for a date night with your special other half, or for a family get together graduation, bday, or even bridal shower celebrations!",

The atmosphere is great, it is small inside, which can be a problem on busy weekend nights, but it creates a really good vibe, especially when the live music starts. I in general am NOT a fan of live music while I am eating. It is often too loud and the performers are typically of average quality at best. I was pleasantly surprised when the music started halfway through my dinner here. The volume level wasn't overbearing and I could still have a conversation with the people at my table without having to yell over the music. The quality of the performance was also pretty decent. The service here overall was great, our server was very attentive and friendly throughout our meal. The food was delicious.

After waiting for a bit, a manager came to our table and stated that the chef would not accommodate our order.  He will in no way deviate from the menu and basically told us he has standards to uphold and obviously we were below them...  We were taken aback as we have never been treated like that before.  We have never had a restaurant not accommodate our diet in some way.  Needless to say we sat in the parking lot for a bit in disbelief.  I wouldn't recommend this establishment to my worst enemy.

Brad still hamming it up at each of his tables as I ate at the bar - no option!   The menu has changed, but the same flavors and presentation. I'll miss my old favorites, but grow up fat boy and suck it up! Try something different. This trip I ordered the Chicken Parmesan....this partially due to Peyton Manning and all of the \"hammered in your head\" commercials on Sunday football. Dang Nationwide Insurance. Class's was no slouch - full of flavor and worth every bite.   Service is fantastic and I'm sure they make a huge tip base as when people are happy - many go 25%+. Brad is that type of server.

However, we were within seconds of walking out at the beginning. Although we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were asked to wait at the bar, where we were ignored for a long time. When I went up front to ask about our table, the hostess played dumb & said she thought we sat down to eat at the bar (we stood the whole time, are tall, and could easily be seen across the room). We were then told that a big birthday party was taking up a lot of tables and resources. Well too bad. You don't overbook your restaurant & shut out people with reservations.   I was literally waving my car key in front of the hostess when we were finally seated. The Maitre d' then proceeded to shake my hand about 10 times to apologize, which I don't love if I plan to eat bread. He did give us free drinks & dessert as I recall. Still, it's better to get it right than to have to apologize for getting it wrong.",

Stuffed garlic bread is amazing and the wine selections and prices are fair.  We will definitely be back. *I heard they offer half portions of entrees if you ask so this would be a good idea unless you are splitting.  It's a little loud with the music so not ideal for a quiet dinner but you can get a table further away from the stage if you make a reservation.",

It didn't take long for me to realize why- this place is so much fun! The decor is warm, cluttered and in your face Italian, but most definitely in a good way. Booths are cozy, tables are close, and it feels as if you're sitting down for dinner with family and friends. There was live music and a welcoming atmosphere and to be honest, I wanted to stay all night. Service was attentive, very informative, but not overly pushy. I didn't feel like our server was trying to get money out of us, he truly seemed passionate about the food and was quick to offer recommendations without being pushy, which is a HUGE plus in my book. We shared the calamari appetizer, my boyfriend had the Linguine Luciano (warning VERY spicy) and I had Fettucine Alla Pappasito. Both were superb. This was a real treat, and I can't wait to come back! Not at all what I expected to find tucked off of Tropicana. Perfect date night location or place to bring the whole family. EXCELLENT!",

So I'm just going to discuss it point by point:  The limo to the restaurant is awesome! The really nice driver picked us up in front of TI and drove us to the restaurant and back. He was really patient. At the end of the night, he had another party to pick up but was really nice about getting us to make up our minds whether we wanted to go or wait until he came back.  The server was awesome! He was super sweet and really helpful when my sister and I couldn't figure out what wine we wanted. I also kept running to the bar area to watch the SC game at one point after ordering a new bottle and he brought my glass to me at the bar. Sweet! :o)  The bar area has the standard bar/pub feel. TVs everywhere you turn. The bartender is really nice even though she was a fan of either Ohio or Oregon, I forget. Well, either way, she was not a fan of SC. :oP  There is a guy who plays piano and sings all songs Dean Martin/Frank Sinatra-esque. Gives the entire place an old school Vegas feel.  All in all, I had an awesome time there. The antipasti were delicious. The wine was fabulous. The game was SHWEET (though unrelated to the restaurant but it just added to my terrific experience because SC won WOOHOO!!!) :o)",

The gnocchi was pretty good, salmon was exceptional and the service was very friendly & knowledgable. Entertainment very nice, and the dark lighting & photos throughout of old Vegas very comforting. The crowd was very loud and boisterous, enhancing the old italian family dining experience. No surprise that the pricing was way out of line though. fifty bucks for a decent dinner and a cocktail?... seriously, like they should be spoon-feeding me & wiping my chin @ those prices.",

    "text": "Since we were planning to be in Vegas for the Rascal Flatts concert at Hard Rock, and having the idea of trying somewhere new for dinner, I made a reservation at this place for my BF and I after reading the good reviews.   Firstly, they arranged to have their limo come pick us up from the hotel right at 4:45p for a 5:00p reservation - nice. The driver was right on time! The drive over to the restaurant was a little longer than anticipated (I had mapped it out at only 3 miles from the hotel) but apparently there was major construction underway on Trop so he had to go an alternative route to avoid that. He gave us a heads up before we arrived that they were in the process of remodeling the restaurant - oh ok.   As we walked in, there were a few tables already occupied but, upon being seated for a few minutes, we realized it was DEAD quiet. Strangely no music (I had envisioned old Blue Eyes crooning in the background as we were sipping our wine and looking at the historic Vegas photos on the walls). Our server informed us that because of the construction, their music system was disconnected. That definitely reduced the \"ambiance\" factor, but about 15 or 20 minutes in, their live music duo started to play oldies. I enjoyed it, but my BF thought it was cheesy LOL.  Anyway, on to the menu - many choices from chicken to meat to pasta! We ended up ordering bruschetta and a simple salad to start, the mussels appetizer, and 1 lb. of spaghetti (yes a whole pound - we've never seen that anywhere!) with pomodoro. The bruschetta was awesome, the spaghetti was pretty decent, and the mussels dish was nice as well (mostly because of the yummy sauce) although they were the big green lip - I prefer the smaller ones.  We were pretty full so decided to pass on dessert (didn't want to be falling asleep at the concert). By the time we finished, we were right on time to get with our driver again for the drive back to Hard Rock. Smooth sailing, tipped driver and bid him farewell.  Overall, it was an enjoyable meal but we definitely came at an awkward time because of the remodeling. I think I'd like to return to this off-the-beaten-path restaurant after the expansion is complete to get a more accurate experience. I actually may return next month when my Mom and I will be there for a 2-night getaway. Saluti!",

There is too much noise, very cheesy design and honestly as one who cooks at home, I have a hard time justifying the prices. I wanted him to be able to have that experience but on a more intimate, low key and mature level. So I chose Casa Di Amore. Just like most people I looked all over yelp for photos, menu prices and ambiance. This restaurant had a great selection of food at a more reasonable price with a more romantic atmosphere. It's dim lit and has large booths, which is always a plus and live music. I am a total sucker for live music at any capacity really.    I ordered the Penne & Greens and my husband ordered the Baked Mostaccioli. We shared a side of Garlic Bread because why not?! Both dishes were very tasty and quite large for the price which averaged $20-$23 a plate. Still a bit expensive considering I can make pasta at home for under $10, BUT we're paying for an experience.   Our waiter was very kind and attentive. There was not a long wait to be seated or to receive our food. Was it the best Italian food I have ever had? No, but it was still really good and the experience was very pleasant. I will definitely come back and as a side note they did have a few other vegetarian dishes on the menu which I am looking forward to eating in the future.",

They offer shuttle service to hotel guests in the area (or to locals that want to leave their car in a hotel near their house instead of driving) and live music daily, for example.

He's been here for years, so just ask him any question and he has the answer! He recommended fried calamari for an app, and it was delicious! Their marinara sauce is amazing! We had the Fettuccine alla pappasito and Eggplant di amore as entrees, and they were very good. Eggplant was a little too salty for my taste, but still good.

    "text": "Had a bad experience the 2nd trip!!! Don't know if I'll be back. I ordered the crispy salmon plate with vegetables and a twice baked potato and a side cesar salad. The cesar salad was coated in mayonnaise it had no taste and it was clumpy just tasted literally like mayonnaise! That was a bummer. Then my plate arrived and I wasn't impreSsed the veggies were partly frozen and tasted microwaved, the twice baked potato was for sure microwaved and dry. The salmon wasn't crispy but soggy and the sauce on top was like a combination of tomato paste and capers with way too much salt! We went on a Monday night they had  half of on all wine bottles which is a nice offer! Nice environment and live music. My hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs but he wasn't happy this time either he said something was going off this night with the sauce and the meat. We had stomach aches that night and the next morning. It just crazy when your food takes for ever and tastes like it was microwaved. I mean I could have done that at home. Oh well won't be making this my favorite italiano restaurante in NV.",

It is decorated in old style Vegas, Frank Sinatra and Ratpack photos. I loved it from the start. Food was pretty good and large portions.  The exotic mango ice cream desert was great.  Probably the best part wad going out to the back for the tiki bar.  Who would have thought! Even though it was outside, it was not terribly hot because there are mister fans going and we were quite comfortable.  Order tiki drinks and food in the tiki bar. If you have dinner in the restaurant,  your receipt has a coupon for a free tiki drink shot.",

They also have live music and an extensive alcohol list, and many specials for happy hour and different days of the week, in case you're looking for a fun place with great food and drinks to let your hair down. It's also really nice, because the menu is a little pricey, and during happy hour the bar menu is 50% off.   Definitely come here! You won't regret it.",

We loved it ! That is totally up my ally and the decor was awesome, bartender was sweet, and it was so relaxing. We forgot we were in the Vegas heat, it was such a cute date night",

You begin with free bread and a nice side salad for $3 more to any entree.  I had the gnocchi with prosciutto and coupled that with some drinks.  The gnocchi was exceptional but I wish it had more prosciutto and spinach to make it more a formidable dish.  The salad was fine, especially for $3 add on, but nothing more than a house salad.  The house wines were actually quite good and large portion.  Draft beers didn't have a large selection but they had a few IPAs and a few high ABV which I always appreciate. The greatest part was the bar area with plenty of TVs and good service from the bartender.  Overall I very much enjoyed my meal and would recommend Casa to anyone in the area or for someone looking for a romantic Italian not overly priced as if it were on the strip.  Half priced wine bottles on Monday and live music almost nonstop are always a plus as well.",

Chicken Parmesan with Alfredo sauce is really good I don't like the marinara sauce.they do charge you extra for Alfred sauce. $4 I think.

Well, luckily my Husband planned our Valentine's Day dinner at Casa Di Amore and I am really glad he did!   It's small, the tables are tight and parking is atrocious. But don't let any of those factors scare you off! The service was fantastic and there was live music, which was great.  We shared clams as an appetizer and they were really good. My Husband was hesitant to order them because he wasn't sure I would like them (little does he know!!). He had veal piccata and I had the gypsy pasta (I think that's what it was called), which was REALLY spicy. I love spicy foods, but this was crazy hot! I would stay away from this if you don't order level 10 spice at Thai restaurants. We also shared tiramisu for dessert and ordered a bottle of wine. Overall, it was a great experience and I am so happy that I finally got to check it out! This is a great date spot and I can't wait to go back!",

Being a regular shopper of Costco, I can attest to saying they served pre-made frozen lobster raviolis from Costco,  I know this, I saw it in the shopping aisle.   The ravioli was not good, super salty as well as mechanically produced.   I did not taste love in that dish, what I tasted was sheer laziness, & someone seeking shortcuts to profitability.  The service was ok - decent, the bartender was pleasant.  I also had a salad that was less than decent, featuring croutons which were pre-made with preservative and additive crap all over them.    The environment is fantastic, I say this because I am into the tacky vegas chic old school type of vibe.  I am also aware the restaurant treats their staff well which is also a plus in my book but I can't give the restaurant more stars because I strongly disliked my food.    I would never come back for the food but for a drink, possibly maybe.  The aesthetic of the environment turned me on but the food and liquor selection is far beneath my personal dietary standards.",

We had not been in a few years due to the fact that we recently had a baby and hardly ever get out for date nights, so we were so excited to finally go out for a date night and chose to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary at Casa Di Amore.   It started out wonderful as we were picked up by the shuttle service at Sunset Station by the driver Craig (he was amazing) and then we had a drink in the new tiki patio experience and that was great too! Once we went inside for our reservation things started to go downhill from there.  We had a reservation and let them know it was a special occasion but we were sat at a small table in the bar section where we did not get the same experience we have had many time before in the restaurant section.  Our order came wrong- that's ok mistakes happen! But once we got the right order the food was disappointingly subpar to say the least- definitely nowhere near the quality of food we have had all other the times we had dined there before. My husband and I looked at each other and both said this was probably our last time dining there :(",

The place is cramped (in a good way) so when you see the incredible food as it comes out of the kitchen you don't mind waiting. Live old school entertainment helps the time pass too. Two in our party are finicky about their favorite dish, Chicken Marsala, and they raved about it. I had the Ciopinno, and it was exceptional. Great drinks, bread, salads, atmosphere.

I have also eaten outside and that is not to be missed either.  The theme is tiki.  Good for families.  Enjoyed the live band outside called pyro surfers.  The food is very good in both locations and you can have happy hour prices outside",

This time we had the frutti de mare, cioppino (amazing),  eggplant and chicken parmigiana (we aren't used to breading on our food so next time we would order without it), shrimp fettuccine alfredo, white clam chowder (yum) and ceasar salads. Oh, make sure you set aside some of your bread to dip into your cioppino broth, it's too good to toss!  Bottom line, this is always a great place to bring friends from out of town and a fun, family friendly venue for everyone. Next time I come here, I'm trying the pizza!",

I was a bit disappointed at the amount of seafood in the Cioppino for $35, but the flavor more than made up for it (maybe just add the other half of the lobster tail for that price). The Oso Bucco was perfect, tender, and packed with flavor. The risotto was very good, and the smoked sausage dish my wife had was great. We finished off with a creme brulee and a canolli, both were just as wonderful as the rest of the dinner.   Perfect date night spot, or party celebration. Staff was very friendly.

    "text": "I said this many times through the night, but Casa di Amore has to be everything I have ever wanted in an Italian restaurant. Upon approaching the building, a man dressed nicely in a suit opened the door for my boyfriend and I. The moment we stepped inside, we were transported into a world of live music, Italian food, and great company.   The restaurant was definitely crowded, I mean come on it was a Friday night, luckily there was an empty table to we were seated right away. Our server Brad came right away to our table just to introduce himself and let us know he was already getting some bread ready for our table. Brad was very helpful through the night in helping us decide which meal would satisfy our taste buds.I opted to get the Frutti Di Mare with a cup of soup. My boyfriend chose the Veal Piccata with a cup of soup.   The Breakdown:  The soup was an Italian take on chicken noodle. The noodles were tiny little pasta balls served in a hot chicken broth with chicken chunks, carrots, and celery.   The Frutti Di Mare was the best I have had in a while. It came with huge mussels, clams, scallops, calamari,  and ginormous shrimp! The shrimp and mussels were definitely my favorite part of the dish. I have never eaten shrimp so tasty or huge before. All of this seafood goodness was served on a bed of linguine with your choice of red or white sauce. The server knew I wanted something a little spicy, so he offered to have the kitchen make the red sauce with some spice. My gosh that was the best decision of my life. It definitely made the dish perfect!  The Veal Piccata came served in a sauce with lemon, mushrooms, basil, and a hint of wine. In addition to that, it came with a small bowl of penne pasta in a marinara sauce. My boyfriend enjoyed the dish, but felt that it was a little too small for him (he eats A LOT, so it's perfect for those who want a normal sized portion).   The night was wonderful and the atmosphere made me smile the whole night. Hearing the live music made me feel like I was transported back in time. This is definitely a great date spot, so definitely try it out! They offer a limo service as well, so if you give them a call earlier in the day they can pick you and your date up! Definitely a way to impress your significant other! It's free of charge, but obviously leave a good tip!",

If I wasn't on a gluten free thing I'd have even been more impressed - did sample a corner of the house bread with oil/balsamic and that ended up the only part of the meal I regret.

    "text": "When Ruben and I get together with one of our group of friends (dubbed the \"Eight-some\"), someone else always plans the dinner, so we are just along for the ride. We came here last Friday night and definitely needed that reservation. The restaurant is small and there's practically no waiting area/lobby, so the hostess stand is very crowded. Our table was in the middle of the restaurant, right next to the bar, kitchen, and two-man band. Luckily, the booth seat is tall, so our view of the bar and kitchen were blocked.  Everyone enjoyed the complimentary bread and particularly the garlic butter that accompanied it. Ruben and I shared the Fried Calamari ($16) served with marinara and a side Caesar Salad ($3 with entree). Ruben ordered Pasta Alla Forno ($30) created with penne, chicken, shrimp, broccoli, and mushrooms in a light pink sauce, then baked in the oven with fresh mozzarella. While I had their Baked Lasagna ($21) filled with marinara, fresh ricotta, ground beef, Italian seasonings, and melted mozzarella. The calamari was good (didn't make my top 5 though) and I liked their marinara. The Pasta Alla Forno was very delicious! Great flavor and the shrimp was especially good. Although, very expensive for a dish of pasta. The lasagna was all right, borderline meh.  Way too much cheese and not enough sauce. It was really difficult for me to eat (I ate less than half). One of our friends ordered Tiramisu and I thought it was decent.  The band was really great! Very talented gentleman and I loved the music they played. The only thing was that with our big group, we couldn't talk to each other much since one end of the table was directly next to the band. Service was really great. Everyone was great, nice, and attentive. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere and exemplifies \"Old School Vegas.\" It's definitely a cool spot to check out. As far as Italian food goes, it was just okay and not worth the cost.  FYI: Great for families - we had an 8-month old with us and it wasn't too loud or rowdy for her. Also, the automatic gratuity is 20% for groups of 6 or more.",

We started with a bottle of red wine. For an appetizer we split an order of brushetta, which was pretty good. My date had pasta with clams in a white wine sauce. He said it's his favorite here. I had the lasagna and was a little disappointed. It was overly salty but otherwise flavorful and large enough to take half home for the next day.

    "text": "Went on a Sunday night and was pretty busy. I was shocked at how LOUD a place called Casa Di Amore was. You will literally have to SCREAM at the person next to you in order to have a chat. I'm good with locals places, not every nice restaurant has to be in a casino or be stuffy but if I am going to pay roughly 100.00 for a dinner for 2 I'd like to not sit 2.5 feet away from a white guy with dreadlocks and his date + hear them scream at each other trying to converse for an hour. Sorry, I'm not cool with sitting in the middle of a loud room in a small 2 seater table for these prices (8 bucks for a beer!!!?? in a restaurant off Trop and Mcloud???). Now if it was 3 bucks a beer and slash about 40% of food prices I can roll with it.  The service was rushed and not great, we saw the waitress twice the whole time (she was busy in her defense). Again for these prices and a spot that calls itself the house of love I was really surprised at the lack of attentiveness.   The food was not great, the calamari was squishy, mealy, flavorless and the kind you are bummed out when you get (anybody who orders it often knows what I mean). The dishes were very average and not large in portion. I had the linguine and clams and like I said it was ok. Can't recommend it though.   I'm going to take Piero's over this place 100 times out of a 100. At least I get great service and a nice atmosphere for my expensive meal.   In a nutshell:  not a place I would take a date because its loud as f and not really intimate (small but not intimate) Expensive as a strip casino for drinks so that rules out swinging by and hanging at bar to listen to the band (which you can barley hear with all the diners yelling at each other) Food on my visit is average at best and the portions were smallish. (in fact a few hours later we went up to Metro Pizza to share some food since we were still hungry). I'd venture to say many people that give overwhelmingly positive reviews did not pay the bill.  In addition I see a lot of reviews that say this spot is \"so old school Vegas\", I mean I guess if by old school means they threw up a bunch of vintage Vegas pictures they found online and blew up. This place hasn't been around THAT long and WTH is old school Vegas about charging 10+ for a cocktail in a local restaurant? The more correct term would be it's Old School/Rat Pack (whatever) Vegas for those that have no clue what that actually means.",

This is an Intimate place to eat (with some dressed casually and some dressed up) with live music (old classics like Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc., and not being played loudly at all but at a comfortable decibel level). As ex-New Yorkers used to good quality Italian TRADITIONAL fare that's hard to find on the west coast, this place fits the bill. We will be back and often!",

The limo driver even asked if we would like to come earlier and was waiting outside the hotel for us. When we arrived, the place was packed, there was a singer and a Sax player, both very good. Our waiter was the best and even took our picture for us. I ordered the mojito, super good and not overpowering. I had the penne a la vodka in a giant bowl. I couldn't eat even half of it. Halfway into our dinner, everyone was singing \"That's Amore\" with the singer. I love this place because it isn't pretentious like the restaurants you find on the strip. I even got a shirt that says \"We have medical marinara\" I'm really happy we chose this place for our anniversary dinner!",

Make sure that you ask for the complimentary limo service when you call to make your reservations.  The limo picked us up from our hotel and took us to a non-descript brick building.  The moment the big heavy door opened for us to walk into the restaurant, you could smell the delicious Italian food and hear the sounds of a two-man band singing classic Italian love songs.  We were in love from the get-go!  There were old photos of the original hotels on the strip and infamous Vegas icons on the walls.  The food was good, not necessarily outstanding, but good.  It was worth the price.  They also had their wines at 50% off for the bottle, which made it totally worth it.  Afterwards, our limo driver actually took us downtown to Fremont Street so that we could enjoy that experience and then we cabbed it back to our hotel on the strip.  It was a good time.",

    "text": "I'm sorry to say this was the worst value yet in Vegas.  I've never given anything two stars (you can check my record), and it's hard for me to even write this, but honestly I can't understand the positive reviews.  The only thing this place has going for it is a vintage ambience, but the food was exorbitantly priced for such mediocrity.  My boyfriend and I started with the fried calamari, which had no seasoning and no calamari.  Then he got the chicken special and I got ravioli.  For what little chicken was on his plate over linquine completely drowned in congealed cream sauce, it was remarkably average and needed to be doctored up.  My ravioli, while large, was the same.  We both were looking for someone to come around and shave some fresh parmesan over our meals, but all they offer is the shake can on the table.  None of this would be horrible if our plates were $10 or $12 dollars a piece, but his was TWENTY-EIGHT dollars (always ask how much the specials are first) and mine was $20--shocking (shocking!), to quote Joan Cusack.  For three small plates (the fried calamari, the chicken, and my ravioli), and just two small glasses of wine, the bill was $100.  Worst $100 ever spent on food.  In every other city, we can get two very well-put together and flavorful meals for the price of one forgettable piece of chicken at Casa Di Amore.  So . . .two stars because the food isn't completely inedible.  Just  underwhelming and a terrible bang for your buck.",

We discovered this hidden jewel about 5 years ago on one of our many trips to Vegas and now a trip to Vegas is not complete without a visit to Casa Di Amore!! Not only is the food AMAZING, but the staff is as well.  We always get the limo and the limo drivers are great.  We have had just about every server they have there and they are all fantastic! Even though we only go twice a year (being out of towners), they remember us!!! That alone is amazing, that they can remember us out of all of the customers they serve. I love the fact that the ambience hasn't changed since the Rat Pack ate there.  That's what makes this place so special, the highbacked maroon leather booths, the wood paneling with all of the pictures of Old Vegas, my only regret is that the Rat Pack is not still alive to join us for dinner.  Someone else reviewed that this place smelled of smoke even though it's a no smoking restaurant. I don't know what they are talking about because I have never smelled smoke in this restaurant and I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke.  The food of course is the most important part and all I can say is FABULOUS!!! We have NEVER been disappointed in anything we've ordered.  Can't say enough good things about Casa Di Amore, this place is the BEST!!!",

    "text": "We recently returned to Casa Di Amore after having moved to the other side of town.  Prior to our move we frequented this restaurant often when it was opened 24/7.  Currently it no longer operates 24/7.  Since returning and then checking yelp for reviews, I was stunned that nobody mentioned the table situation since the renovations, because it is bad enough to ruin your dining experience.  One of the unique features about this restaurant is that it has booths to accommodate up to 6 people.  Since the renovation, the owner opted not to replace the tables that fit the booth!  Instead he opted to put TWO  2-top tables together turned sideways!  So these spacious booths now have two very narrow tables, side by side resulting with two people  eating where the two tables meet.  What was he thinking!  In addition, these tables have huge cafe stands which limit your leg and foot room.  The tables also are not balanced to the floor which means you need to be very aware of your plates at all times because they  tilt and swerve.  Who does this?  All the booths in this restaurant now have this impractical table setup.  Michael get the correct tables for your booths.  Another annoying feature about the renovations would be the extremely bright (pink) spot lights on each table.  It is like being in a room with over the top  pink fluorescent lighting in your face.  There is nothing warm about the lighting anymore in this restaurant unless you sit in the bar.  A lighting designer would never use this configuration.    The food.  The beauty of Casa Di Amore in its day was the quality and value.  The current prices at Casa Di Amore are very  inflated for the quality.  As in Sinatra pricing at the Encore minus the high quality food.  The food presentations are what my Sicilian grandmother would call \"half-hearted\".  Their signature wedding soup is now loaded with salt, missing the greens (that it use to have) and the broth that years ago you could tell took hours to make fresh, now tastes like it is out of a carton.    Our pasta dishes were delivered to the table unfinished.  As in, someone dumped penne into a bowl and then poured a tiny bit of sauce in the dead center.  Naked pasta is better left for a buffet line.  It was also grossly over cooked.    One good thing is that Casa Di Amore still has really good entertainment.   Sadly, we won't be returning to this restaurant again.  We will drive the extra few miles to get better quality food, correct tables and elegant dining atmosphere at Allegro, Sinatra or Capos.",

Added to that the fellow singing and playing the keyboard and his drummer kept getting louder and louder.  It was  impossible to have a conversation there.  I realize that the restaurant is not to blame (other than the singer/drummer), but it certainly made for a very unpleasant evening.  Food was good, but certainly nothing that special.

We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate that kept our bill under $60 for the meal.  Our waitress, host and gentleman who was singing on stage were all super friendly and superb at their jobs.  The only reason for leaving off one star was the seating was a bit uncomfortable and we both found the lack of lighting to be somewhat awkward.  These are just little concerns for a great meal though.",

I must say that the other reviews are very accurate as to what you should expect.  It is a nice little place with live music. The food and service was very good!!  As a bonus the bottles of wine are 1/2 price on Sunday and Monday nights.  You need to ask because that is not advertised.  We had  an appetizer, two meals, and a bottle of wine for $80.00.  I would highly recommend this for a special occasion.",

There was no waiting seating so we had to sit in the car. Reservations were at 845 and we did not get seated till 930. This was very disappointing due to it being my birthday and it set us back alot. Nothing was done to show they valued their customers. The food was good but I'm disappointed they didnt have more empathy for us waiting so long. Mind you I was not in it for anything free and this is why I did not request to speak to a manager. I let it go but a simple apology for the inconvenience would have been really nice. This in not saying I wouldn't come back because the food and actual service once seated is amazing.",

The wine list is varied with a decent amount of choices.  The stuffed peppers appetizer was phenomenal. Cooked to perfection with the pepper soft enough but not over cooked. The stuffing was delicious and the sauce on it matched perfectly.  The osso bucco entree was also excellent with the risotto side to match.  My wife had eggplant parmigiana that was bitter and had a dark marinara that made it more bitter. The homemade pasta was over cooked with the same sauce. She didn't like either.  None of the deserts are homemade, we didn't even look at the menu for it.",

    "text": "So I am a huge Italian food fan and have even been to Italy for a long period of time.  I made reservations for this place at 5:30pm on a Tuesday to make sure we got a table.  Once we arrived, they sat us at a tiny table facing the stage.  I didn't care for whoever was performing because he kept talking to a guest he knew anyways.  And I really didn't appreciate the tiny table when there were other open ones.    Anyway, our waiter took awhile to get to us.  Once he came to us, we started with the Calamari ($14).  It was really really good.  Probably the best thing in this place.  I like that it wasn't overcooked and wasn't overly flavored.  It's a must get here.  For dinner, I went with their Eggplant Di Amore and the person I came with ordered a side of Pesto Pasta and a side of their Gypsy Pasta to try both.  After we ordered the complementary bread and butter came.  It was a long warm baguette that had been cut up.  It was decent.  My Eggplant Di Amore ($26) can be described as an eggplant lasagna.  It was fresh breaded eggplant with ricotta, mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and topped with Parmigiano Reeggiano and Mozzarella Cheese.  The entire thing was baked just like a lasagna and served with a large portion of Spaghetti.  I thought the entire dish was alright.  I didn't see much ricotta at all.  I thought it was a little dry and was more on the salty side.  The spaghetti that I had one bite of I could have done without.  I got to try the pastas that the person I came with ordered.  The Pesto Pasta was pretty good.  The Gypsy, which is basically their popular spicy marinara pasta was also pretty good but nothing crazy.  The total was $60.  Nothing there wowed us besides their calmari.    And the service definitely did not wow us.  The food took forever to come out and so did the bill and take home container.  The waiter didn't really made any good recommendations.  It was like he was just kinda there to do his work and quickly go home.  The inside of this place is small so probably why the long waits on the weekends.  There is the dining room and a bar area in the back.  The inside looked like a dive bar with booths to be honest.  There were a lot of locals there.  Mostly elderly people.  There was an annoying large group there to celebrate one of their son's birthdays.  One of the guys from the party knew the guy singing so they kept talking like I mentioned earlier.  The rest of his party also kept getting up.  They kept getting in the way when people were trying to use their bathroom.  No crowd control?  If this is Vegas top Italian spot, I feel bad.  Not sure I'll be back.",

I called at 6:25pm asking for the wait time because if it is long then I'll find somewhere else to go.  Las Vegas has many places for dinner.  The woman on the telephone offered a reservation at 8pm --Ok, that's good because the initial reviews read are good.  We arrived at 7:50pm for our 8pm reservation.  I don't mind waiting sometime because we are early.  I check in with the hostess and was told that they are getting the table ready and it will be a \"short\" time.  Cut to FIFTY MINUTES LATER at 8:40pm, we are still waiting.  After checking in with the hostess a couple times, they keep telling us, \"short\" time, 10-15 minutes.  It is after 9pm now, more than 1 hour after we arrived and more than 1 hour after our reservation time, and definitely NOT a short time, or NOT after 10-15 minutes.  We left to In-N-Out a couple blocks away.  Throughout this entire time, we were told, they cater to locals and the people are not leaving, their checks are paid, but they are not leaving.  Well, I can understand that, but please do not tell me it will be a short time, or it will be 10-15 minutes, or promise me reservations at 8pm.  Just tell me the truth. Do not waste my time, especially on a vacation in a city that has so many other options.  If I knew about the 1+ hour wait (with reservations) I would have decided differently.  Do not tell me something that is not True.  The restaurant knows the estimated wait time and do not tell me it will be a short time.  This is what happened, my party of 5 and I lost  1+ hours waiting because this restaurant kept telling us the wait is a short time, promised a 8pm dining time, and kept telling us 10-15 minutes.",

Casa Di Amore is about 10 minutes away from the strip so it's not something you are going to just come across on the strip but do make an effort to come here when you are in Las Vegas. One of the main reasons this was a planned visit, was due to the great reviews. I will tell you that I was not disappointed at all. The spaghetti was absolutely fantastic, it was perfectly cooked with gigantic meatballs. The spaghetti was very fresh & hot.   I do wish they would have had a smaller portion as 1 pound was too much for just myself but I tried my best to still finish it because it was that good. It was a smaller place with a great feel to it and the spaghetti was better than I would have imagined it to be.   The staff was very friendly including our server and food arrived in a timely fashion. As a nice bonus, the server set us up with a shuttle from the restaurant back to the strip at no charge! I thought this was a nice gesture as again it's about 10 minutes outside of the strip where I wanted to get back to anyway. The shuttle was newer, clean & air conditioned. The driver was courteous and our party did tip him which you should do the same as after all it is a free ride.   If you like Italian food, don't forgot to make reservations when you are booking your trip to Vegas! I will certainly be returning on future trips to Las Vegas.",

It honestly looks almost like a low key strip club from the outside, but when you walk inside it's like an old school 40's-50's kind of feeling. There's also a random tiki bar in the back. There were a couple of guys who looked like they were part of the Rat Pack that played some good live music. The staff was super friendly and service was quick. The food was good too. My boyfriend got Grandma's chicken soup and really enjoyed it. The antipasto platter was good, nothing fabulous, but you can only do so much with that so I won't fault them for that. We shared the chicken parmesan which was super tasty and a good size portion. Overall we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely stop by again on our next trip. The best part was the free shirt you get when you order the cannoli, especially because it's from one of my favorite movies :)",

Don't judge the outside because the inside is a whole other ballgame. Walking in, you see what an Italian restaurant is supposed to look like. Dimly lit, lots of booths, even ones for just two people, live lounge like music.   We were greeted right away and taken to a smaller booth. Our server greeted quickly as well. Seeing that it was just before 7pm, these two instances were both very surprising. Soon after we were sat, the rush came in. We placed our drink orders to our server and snuck towards the back of the place. The back is another world. In fact it's a tiki bar. On the backside of the same place. It's where the overflow goes for people waiting for their table. Pretty cool little area.  Once we finished playing around in the tiki bar we came back to the Italian world we started in. Our food came shortly after sitting down. The food is good, nothing outrageous to say.   This place is great for a drink and people watching, all while listening to some good tunes.",

They get busy sometimes. If your waiting for tables, head right to the back. They have a tiki bar. Awesome drinks and occasional live music as well. If your are in vegas this is a place to visit.",

Well worth the 20 minute drive to get off the strip!  Dark and comfortable inside it a full menu and bar.   There was beer, Chianti and chocolate martinis had.   The menu... fresh hot mini loaves with garlic butter. And probably should have just stopped there but we didn't so: We ordered Chicken Parm that came out the size of a Texas a Chicken Fried Steak hot and tender. Chicken fettuccini Alfredo with a side of veggies that just wasn't finishable it was it was so big and delicious. Lasagna, bacon wrapped scallops rounded out our entrees.   Creme brulee was for dessert and we all shared ( honestly I ate most of it bc creme brulee should never be wasted even when on a diet).  I earned the t-shirt- literally-a great souvenir.   They had live entertainment mostly a la Rat Pack. But it was nice and soothing to our lively group of sales reps that just needed to bring it down a notch or ten at the end of the day.  Our server was a good sport and very engaging. Every thing served exactly right!   Do yourself a favor and stop by for a nice evening of good food and entertainment.   *Bonus* they have a van service than runs to and from some of the casinos on the strip. Just call and ask.",

Perfect ambiance for a date night or any occasion that requires Italian food!   GET THE CHEESY BREAD!   Kind of pricey overall for the portion size but I'd still come back for the ambiance!

Found out later that they have a free shuttle service which will pick you up and drop you off to your hotel.   The location and exterior is not very impressive from the outside but don't worry as you won't be disappointed with your meal.    We had a large party and they were very accommodating.   Ambiance is quite dim, but lively.  It has more of a classic old school restaurant feel.   They have a decent sized dining area and also have live entertainment which played very good music.  It was loud but you could still have a conversation and also sing along when you wanted to.  They have a very extensive menu including a kids menu.   This is not your typical Vegas meal with small portions, where presentation is more important than the taste and inflated prices.  They give hearty portions and serve fantastic food.  I ordered the Frutti Di Mare with white sauce and loved every single bite.  Generous portions of seafood.  Everyone was completely satisfied with their order and raved about how they would definitely eat here again.",

It was the last day in Vegas and we had no car, and luckily I researched this place which provides free transportation to and from any hotel on the strip.   Post the amazing KA show at MGM, we decided to head for dinner at this place which is located in Central vegas, a part which no one really talks about. It was about a 15 minute ride and we entered a neighborhood which makes you realize that normal people with normal apartments, family life with kids, schools , churches, supermarkets, also live in Vegas !  They do not have many vegetarian options, but they do customize. And they do understand that chicken broth with vegetables does not amount to vegetarian soup ! Mondays they have wine special which is half off whole night. And pizzas are half off after 11 pm.   We bought the pesto penne pasta. The vegetables it comes with is artichoke and sun-dried tomatoes, but we got them to add green peppers, brocolli. Kylie was as super helpful ( as he was cute ;) ), though he forgot to get our drinks and had to be reminded.   The ambiance is old timish including live soulful music.  We were grooving to the music all through dinner. You can even make requests and dance to their song. There was old couple who were dancing on their anniversary or something and it was super cute and romantic. It was all like getting transported back in time where mobiles and racing with time does not exist.   Food is on the higher scale but its worth every penny. Just HAVE to come back to try proper full course meal with dessert.   Tips:  1. Come hungry 2. Come well dressed preferably, u may just want to get up and dance",

The atmosphere I would give a 3 out of 5 because of how cramped and small it is.  We were greeted right away, seated as well. They do live music which was very pleasant, don't hesitate to make an request of course within the same genre being performed. Our waiter, was nice..very quick. Mind you it's loud with chatter and music so it's best to have your order in mind when the server comes back. It's meant for small talk and enjoying an experience.   My date and I ordered a Cesar salad to split, it was perfect! Not over dressed or under,nice crunch and fresh.   Then we shared the lasagna. It was rich with the ricotta but very tasteful. I hear they make their own pasta..if that is so, that is very unique I may have tasted a difference just a tad. Everyone Taste bud are different.   We followed it with a cannoli, first and last one we will probably have. There was nothing wrong with it, I suppose it just wasn't our kind of dessert this time around.   Good Italian, worth going.",

Always bugs me when waiters treat you like crap because you don't feel like drinking.  Needless to say, she wasn't very attentive.    For dinner, we ordered the fried calamari, which was tasty, an 18\" New York style cheese pizza, and a penne in rose cream sauce with chicken, broccoli, and mushroom.  It's not fresh homemade pasta, but sometimes I just want this type of rustic old style Italian feel eating. The pasta was a bit pricey at $31 and we added on a New England clam chowder for $3.  For dessert, we had the exotic Bombay which was a passion, mango, raspberry sorbet formed into a ball, covered in white chocolate,  then drizzled with chocolate and raspberry sauce.  It was so good.  Each dessert ordered also comes with a free t-shirt.   I would come back, but hope I get better service next time around.",

Consider skipping lunch.  Craig picked us up and entertained us on the short ride to the resIt's next door to the Gun Store. Book your ride before you leave for LV, as they may not be able to accommodate upon arrival.   We were pleased that they accommodated our request for a booth. It is LOUD, due to factors such as the live music (yup, Volare rang out), the conversation level and the singing patrons.   The menu cracked me up. There's a section called Touch of Italy which is supposed to represent meals that aren't commonly found on Italian menus. If that's True, then it should be titled Taste of Italy, no? Not sure where others grew up, but in my hometown eggplant parmigiana, gnocchi and lasagne (all $22) aren't considered exotic.  House white was about $9 for a small glass I believe. House red appeared to be a slightly larger pour. They had Peroni but I don't recall if it was draught or bottled.  Bread is housemade daily, and it's tasty. Don't fill up on it (rookie mistake) because you'll need room for your meal. As in rent an extra hotel room for your leftovers. There's a section of the menu called One-pound Pasta Bowls ($23-36). Not sure if that's how much the food weighs or how much you'll gain by eating it. At least 50% of our group didn't finish their meals, not that they can be blamed.   After your meal you can retire to the Polynesian delight that is the Casa de Tiki. Someone close to me says that my love of tiki bars knows no bounds. Close, but we were with the same people who attempted to navigate Frankie's Tiki Bar with us, and I'm still trying to live that Scavenger Hunt of Shame down, so clearly there are limits, even for me. CDT does not disappoint. Watch the changing posters! Take a photo with the Kracken! Enjoy the all-hour Happy Hour! Highly recommended.  Not sure that CDA is an every-time in Vegas experience, but I foresee at least a few more visits. Seemed to be a local-loaded crowd. No trouble with service. I'd wanted to go there for years; glad that we made it happen.",

It is very filling, and a large portion of pasta with red sauce.

This ended up being a big time naughty meal and I was trying to be good. I started out with a hearty Italian chicken and vegetable soup which was so simple - but so delicious. The veggies were perfect, chicken tasty, and broth was out of this world.   My main course was cioppino, a classic fisherman's stew with shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, crabmeat, fish, and  two large lobster claws.   I've had cioppino from Rome to San Francisco and this was the best! The broth was spicy and complex but not hot or over powering, just flat out delicious. The seafood was fresh and succulent especially the lobster claws. Cioppino is my go-to meal to avoid fattening pasta but with a broth this excellent it begs to be dunked with a warm, crusty bread to soak up the flavorful broth. I ordered the their most naughty bread - the famous garlic loaf-crusty, feather soft inside, piping hot crammed with garlic and so much cheese. Well - I dunked the fantastic soup and the cioppino till every drop was gone. I felt wonderful till I got on the scale the next day. Bummer! now I gota pay for my fun.",

    "text": "Quite simply, if you're reading this and you have any doubts, let them go and make your reservation.  We did and this place delivered, and we were eating there on Christmas Eve, but do be sure and make a reservation, as it's very easy to see that this place is small and very popular.  Do you like a loud fun room?  Again, they've got it covered.  Do you want a band to be playing?  They've got a small stage and two very gifted musicians playing on the night we are there.  Do you like your wine half off?  Well Monday happened to be half off night and so our group enjoyed not one, but two bottles of wine.  Do you like old pictures of Vegas casinos?  They've got a great selection of these as well.  Note that I have not yet referred to the food or the service, both of which emerged as excellent.  Our server struggled with the cork on the first bottle of wine, no problem, she simply got help, decanted the wine, and we were all happy.  At least four people made sure that our water was always filled, and we were able to enjoy two bread baskets with some of the best garlic butter in recent memory.  There was a lobster special happening that night, the scallops were some of the best cooked and most tender we've ever enjoyed and the chicken piccata arrived with the salt just the way that I like it.  We got out cannolis to go and they came with a free tee-shirt that said, \"leave the gun, take the cannolis.\"    Great meal, great service, great music, great overall atmosphere, nice shirt, what more do you want?",

Ambiance & Service:  Brick walls with some great throw back pictures of strip casinos from the 90s adorn the walls.  Dim lighting and tight but comfortable seating make for a nice dining environment.  There was live music on the night we visited so it wasn't quiet but totally added to the cool vibe.  Our server was on point and very friendly.  His assistant server kept the drinks fresh throughout the evening.  Very well well done.  Entrees:  The portions for all our orders were very generous.  The calamari was tasty and the bruschetta made for great appetizers.  I had the chicken fettucine alfredo and it was loaded with plenty of chicken.  My niece had the Osso Bucco veal and it was so tender (you could tear it apart with a spoon) and delicious.  The cannelloni comes out with 3 huge pasta tubes filled with some flavorful meat and cheese.  All the dishes are rich in flavor and I got full very quickly.  This is a popular Italian restaurant for good reason as they really deliver at all levels.  They're a little pricier than your average casual restaurant but you're definitely getting your money's worth with the overall experience. I will definitely be back to try more dishes.  Enjoy!",

Our waiter Tony was fantastic! He was truly one of the best waiters I think I've had the pleasure of getting served by!  We started with 2 appetizers, fried calamari and the bruschetta. The calamari breading was perfectly cooked with a light and crispy breading. The bruschetta had a delicious chopped tomato and garlic topping.  We had a variety of main entree's, chicken piccata, veal piccata, gnocchis with prosciutto, chicken parmigiana. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entree's!  They also have live music with a 2 man band, playing and singing oldies.  Service 10/10 Food 10/10 Ambiance 10/10  Thank you for a wonderful night out!",

The most I knew of this place was that the former Frank Sinatra sound-alike that used to be at the Brown Derby at the MGM Grand (now Craftsteak) performed there.  Well, I'll tell you that this is some of the best Italian food I've had here in Las Vegas.  Yes, the place is small, but the atmosphere is wonderful, especially the live music during dinner.  I liked the fact that the singer came from table to table shaking hands and singing.  Also that people felt free enough to dance and to toast each other.  I had the Pomodoro Fresco, which is the pasta with garlic butter and tomatoes.  Yummy!  And for dessert, I had their cannoli, which was absolutely fabulous!  Reminded me of cannoli from the late, great Albina's bakery and also from back east in Buffalo at Ilio DiPaolo's restaurant.  Also, because I got the cannoli, I got a free T-Shirt with the restaurant logo on the front and the immortal line \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" on the back!  So cool!  Will definitely be going back there!",

(We had to mention we never got our drinks).  The food was unremarkable and somewhat disappointing.  Not bad - but my baked ziti variation featured overcooked pasta.  Inexcusable in an Italian establishment that should know what al dente means.  There are so many choices in Vegas, and the best I can say about this place is: the parking was very convenient.",

I love the fact that they send a limo to pick you up at your hotel which is a big help if you do not have a rental car. You have to set it up in advance, but it is worth it since all you do is tip limo driver and saves you from paying cab both ways. I definitely recommend doing this. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were shown promptly to our seats.  We went on Monday night which is 1/2 price bottles of wine. We chose a Risota Muscat d' Asti which was a great wine. We decided to try the garlic loaf on this visit as appetizer and it was great. Good Italian bread with rich buttery garlic sauce and melted cheese. Very tasty and something I would get again. The wife and I both added a Caesar salad to our entree which is only a $3 addition. What a steal. They make a very good Caesar here and you must get it when you dine. For entree I chose the linguine and clams with red sauce and my wife had the eggplant Parmesan. Both were really good and generous portions. For dessert we shared a creme brulee and it was pretty good. Nothing terrific, but tasty. Good thing is you get a free T-Shirt when you order a creme brulee or cannoli for dessert.   Service here is top notch. Waiters are very courteous and come by often to check on you. They pour the wine and fill you glass as needed. This is an old school place that is classy. There is a lounge singer and saxophone player there that provide entertainment while you dine. The place looks and feels like an old classy location. We love coming here and it will probably be on our list to visit every time we come to town. If you are able to come and check it out, you will not be disappointed.",

This will now be a resturant we stop at every vegas trip.   First, the atmosphere is fun and a nice change from the Strip.  Second, the food was really good! We actually shared a 1lb pasta bowl, I personally am a huge pasta fan (favorite food) and this pasta was delicious. We got the Spaghetti and Meatballs with meat sauce. The meat was full of flavor and the pasta tasted so fresh.  Third, the live music was AWESOME! Unfortunately I don't recall the name of these two guys, but one played piano while the other drummed. They seemed to know any song, and we even requested a Frank Sinatra song and was not disappointed. They really sounded amazing and if I was local I would definitely book them for a party.  Fourth, the service was a bit slow, but with the music and nice atmosphere we didn't mind. The dessert was not up to par and they immediately took it off the bill and asked if we wanted another, altho we were too full, the consideration was very thoughtful and overall the service was very friendly.   Definitely a must try if you're looking for Italian and fun night!",

It doesn't makes sense at all. More than half the seats were empty. I was willing to pay for an additional meal while seating. Pretty ridiculous policy and a manager that was unwilling to work with a customer. Instead of introducing herself, the manger stood right behind the hostess and had her repeat over and over that they can't serve me. Hey if you're the boss, learn to approach a customer head on and see how you could help instead of putting your bitch face on and standing there like a statue.",

It had the feel of an old school New York Italian restaurant.  For our appetizer we ordered the twice wrapped prawns. It was okay but not nearly as good as I was hoping it would be. The flavors just weren't there.  For our entrees we ordered the pork chops with vinegar and peppers and the eggplant di amore. Both were quite good, and the portions were large.

If you order Clams with red sauce or white sauce you get a ton of clams. They do not skimp. The atmosphere is like the old Vegas style and you will feel like you walked back into time, especially with the live music playing while you eat. The bread is delicious and we always seem to get a little too much cause we love it! You will for sure not leave hungry. We have never had a bad experience here and we have been going for years! It is a little off the strip but so worth going if your in the mood for some good food. If you are visiting and have no car, just call and make a reservation they will come get you in their limo. ( I recommend reservations anyway because they can get pretty busy at dinner time) Great place for special occasions or if you just want some good Italian food!! Oh and try their Cannolis you will love them!! Yummy!!!",

A must from now on when I visit. No 1 in Vegas as far as I'm concerned. Thank you for the great meal.",

    "text": "What can I say? Casa di Amore delivers the goods. We had no reservation, but our table of three was quickly seated for an early dinner. This is an old school joint with large red booths where vintage Vegas posters and photos of Sinatra dress the walls.   Warm bread got us started, an order of calamari ($13) followed. I love calamari when it's done right. When it's bad, it's BAD. There's nothing worse than deep fried rubber bands. No need to worry here, this calamari was tender and lightly breaded. The marinara sauce on the side was fantastic - well seasoned, not too acidic. I rarely find this to be the case. Needless to say, we devoured it so quickly I never snapped a photo.   Moving on to entrees, we ordered two orders of Eggplant di Amore ($24). And the house specialty, Osso Buco ($35). I couldn't tell you which is better. They are wildly different, but equally delicious.  Eggplant di Amore has slices of eggplant layered  like lasagna with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, spinach and sundried tomatoes. It is served with a side of spaghetti.  Osso Buco is classic Italian. They roast the veal shank to perfection, it falls off the bone. It's served with what I believe is an aged sharp cheddar risotto. It is unexpected and mighty scrumptious.  I was much too full for dessert, but a canoli and tiramisu were ordered. The canoli is filled to order so the shell remains crisp and the filling is rich and not overly sweet. It was a surprise to learn a free T-shirt comes with any canoli order. Service was steady and pleasant throughout. Not a single complaint could be made. Casa di Amore is a winner.",

Honestly I love that the kitchen opens late until 4AM and the bar until 5AM but I find the prices to be a bit over the top. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad but for a salad it's $12 and a 1 pound pasta dish is $22. Not to mention my girlfriends and I split the 1 pound pasta dish thinking it would be plenty but it was teeny. We are hungry young ladies who EAT! We ordered the cannoli and tiramisu for dessert. Final verdict; it's average and the prices are high. For late night I encourage happy hour in which they have but only for pizzas.",

First, it was crowded, tight seating, and noise but I will say the life music is good which makes the small place and so so acoustic rather harsh on the ears.  That night it seemed like half of the guests had birthdays as it gets old quick to hear Happy Birthday being sung so often.  Our server was very good My veal was just average as I've had better for a few dollars less.  My wife's lasagna was better than my veal but a somewhat small portion.",

On this visit I joined some friends and I was so glad that I got the invite. Smith the Manager greeted me as always what a guy he remembers all his guests. We got to the table where some appetizers had already been ordered and arrived a few minutes after we did. Brad who was our servers is outstanding...He remembered my drink and asked if I would like to enjoy my usual Gin and Tonic...For someone to remember such detail is awesome! George was singing as usual, NOW if you haven't been here before George is an amazing \"Entertainer\", If you close your eyes sip you Martini its just like listening to \"A young Frank Sinatra\".  We put our orders in and I ordered the Daily Special with Modifications I wanted to try the Risotto. I am so glad that I did...This dish blew my mind, I would rate this is as one of my all time best Risotto dishes. I have had quite a few especially as I did part of my Chef Training in Genova, this rates right up there with some of the best. My friend ordered the Cioppino and this was so rich and flavor full, the sauce was divine...  I have to say as a restauranteur I am amazed that the labor turnover is so low, this shows one thing that the team members want to be here to work, most have been there over a decade...  When visiting Las Vegas this is a must visit place I know it not on the strip but a 15 minute jaunt off the strip is totally worth it...They can even send a limo...we got one back to the Hotel... This is a secret that the locals all visit....YOU NEED TO VISIT THIS PLACE...DONT LEAVE VEGAS WITHOUT DINNING HERE",

I got the veal parmesan which comes with a side of pasta and consisted of 4 pieces of veal and almost too much for me to eat.  I had to take a break half way through the meal to rest before I could complete the meal.  The waiter was wonderful and personable; a joy to be served and gave great suggestions tailored to our tastes.  Along with the meal you get live music singing Sinatra songs and such from that era.  When we got close to the end of our meal we asked to call for a cab and he arranged for us to be driven back in there limo.  Really nice touch.",

But if it was in business in 1959, you can bet Sinatra and company would've loved this place.  I went here with a big group of friends and all agreed that the food was great!  The service during dinner was also friendly, welcoming and the courses were brought out neither too fast or too slow.

We were only at the bar for about 10 minutes and my girlfriend had told the manager \"Smitty\" what had happened at the last restaurant, we were starving!  After hearing our story Smitty came right over and got us a table!  Awesome!!! Or server, i think his name was Bret or Brad, was great!  Eggplant was soooo good. As was the bruchetta and gypsy pasta with meatballs. ..can't wait to go back!",

So crowded that we had to eat at the bar, but they had special wooden placement to make eating at the bar very easy.  Sitting at the bar, we were near the live trio entertainment. Something of a \"old style Vegas act\" performing 50's Rat pack type music. Up front and close they were quite the impressive guys.  Anyway lets talk about the food.  First, the bartender/waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. We followed her suggestions for the specials. A buratta and pancetta  bruschetta on toast with roasted red peppers was just excellent.  Next we shared a caesar salad which was a little disappointing - just kind of flat in the way of flavor. The entree was really special - very fresh ingredients - a garlic shrimp over fettuccine. The sauce was not ready or too rich and had some sausage, fresh tomatoes. The only thing that would have made it better was larger fresh shrimp. Had a great night here. People watching is always a great entertainment!",

    "text": "I am so confused by the positive reviews. I ordered takeout at 2am... Spaghetti meat sauce... A very difficult dish to mess up... Not exaggerating when opened the lid it literally smelled like DOG FOOD. Like a literal can of dog food. That smell. WTF????? The texture of the meat was grainy (how??? I don't understand; it was bizarre). I took a bite and called them back. There was very little sauce so I at first asked for more sauce, thinking maybe that would help. NO. There was something wrong with the meat. Mind you this is a $22.50 spaghetti meatsauce that smelled like dogfood. I don't even know how someone in their right mind could serve that to a customer... And charge $22.50... What????? The server and the manager dealt with the situation professionally and promptly so this review is not for them. They gave me a spaghetti meatball instead and gave me a canolli on the house. The canolli was great, but the dish they gave me was also sub par (waay too salt and i'm a salt addict)... not what you expect for $22.50 LOL!!! This review is for the cook: you need to re learn proper food handling/ safety because the 2 bites of your dogfood spagetti meatsauce MADE ME SICK. I will spare you the details. I cannot even wrap my mind around the ridiculous $22.50 price. How long was that sitting there???? Was that an old dish that was sitting there that you tried to get rid of? How old was the sauce and was it kept at the proper temp? There's no way. Would you serve that to your friends or family???? Would you pay $22.50 for that dish???? How would you feel if you were sick from eating it? Would you be pissed enough to write a one star Yelp review? Seriously, relearn proper food handling/ safety skills. If the health department came in there and saw you serving that, you would be shut down.",

The 2 meats were seasoned like my grandmother had made them herself. My wife had fettuccine alla pepasito. It was a wonderful dish.  It had just the right amount sauce and seasonings. Our friend had the gnocchi.  She was extremely happy with her dinner (she's been here 10+ times).

After a hefty wait at the bar we were seated and the evening could not have gone any better. Service was top shelf. Food was WOW awesome. Drinks and recommendations from our server top notch. The place was full of locals who came for dinner and the house band which was incredible. Hence the reason nobody leaves and the wait was a little long. I don't give 5 but this one was definitely worth it. Next time we will take advantage of free limo service. Too bad five stars is max!",

    "text": "I am sooo sorry, Casa di Amore. I didn't realize I never wrote you a review until my mother-in-law talked about how she's coming back and I had to look you guys up again.  On to my review...  I am anti-weddings or should I say I'm anti the weddings *I've* attended. The weddings I've been to in the last few years have been kinda mehh. The consistent theme that I've noticed is that the food is never really that wonderful, which sucks because that's the most costly part. When it came down to planning my whole shebang, I didn't want to throw a $20,000 wedding for 175 people with crappy food. Plus ever since Britney Spears got married in Vegas, I've always had this crazy idea in my head that I should get married there too. So, that's what we did. Our plan: to have a 15 minute ceremony that would have the best damn wedding food and greatest party you've ever experienced. Casa di Amore helped make my big night absolutely flawless.   We had originally planned for a Brazilian steakhouse that our chapel could package with our overall wedding. The chapel screwed up and forgot to make the reservation with the steakhouse. By the time they noticed their error, they told me the place was booked up. The problem with having your wedding on a hella cool date like 9-10-11 is that everyone  ELSE wants that hella cool date too. We called a bunch of different places on the strip including Maggianos and no dice. My mom, of all people, actually found Casa di Amore and told me to call them. Immediately after speaking with Kathleen, I knew that this was going to be a perfect fit for my wedding. She was absolutely one of the best people that I dealt with throughout my wedding process. She gave me their traditional catering menus but said if we saw something else on the menu we liked, they could change it and edit it.   The food: we had 30 guests and everyone raved about the food (my dad's review is even on here...look for Russ C.) My husband's family is all 100% Italian, so I was hoping this would live up to their expectation and it did. They all were so impressed by the antipasto platter that we had served as an appetizer and said \"Wow, this place is authentic.\"  And yeah, I'm pretty darn competitive so to hear my dad and step-mom tell me the food was WAY better at our wedding than at my step-brothers, well that was one of my proudest moments of 2011.   The service: our waiters were great, very attentive and personable. They were happy to make wine and champagne suggestions but didn't try to push anything extra on us.  The $$$: Kathleen only made us pay a small deposit of $100 to reserve the space for us. She followed up with us throughout the whole process but sent us another follow-up email the day before just to make sure we were still good to go and that we didn't want to change anything. We thought the prices were extremely fair in comparison to how much food and how amazing it was.  Ambiance: so fun! There was a lounge singer there that night and my guests loved it. We got a free show while we ate.  If anyone is thinking of doing a dinner here, I would highly recommend it. The process is easy and Kathleen will put your mind at ease. OR if you've been there, done that on the whole wedding thing and are just thinking about a nice date, doooo it! It's great to get away from the strip and experience a little old Vegas. They also have limos that will come pick you up as long as you make a reservation and call in advance.",

Our waiter was friendly and let us know he was in no hurry to rush us, so we had a leisurely 2 hour meal, one of the best I've had in town this year. The chianti was a great selection paired with our meals. We had a basket of fresh bread brought to our table. For an app we had the prosciutto crostini ... Delicious. I had lasagna and my date had gnocchi. We both loved out food, and I have to say my lasagna was like no other I've ever had. We took 2 cannoli to go, but haven't had yet.  I would absolutely come back. It was a pricey meal but the quality made it worth it for a special occasion or an \"impress your date\" night.  FYI Monday is 1/2 price bottle of wine night!",

With it being only about ten minutes from the strip and they have complimentary shuttle service it makes it a great option for people looking to dine off the strip. It is a predominately a locals spot, however, a great place for anyone. The decor here reminds of a place straight out of the rat pack era/ old Vegas era which is an awesome sight to see, as Vegas has changed so much since then. We generally choose to sit at the bar as they have video poker games. The bartenders and the rest of the staff are friendly we especially like Roshy. Our most recent time there were shared the mini osso bucco which was served on top of risotto. This dish was absolutely fantastic, and loved every single bite. We waited a little bit before ordering our entrees but when we did we split the veal francaise which was served with a side of pasta. This dish was one of the best plates of Italian food I have ever had. The veal was perfect and tender the lemon butter was delicious. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce that we chose for our pasta which was Alfredo was amazing. After gambling and drinking a couple more drinks they arranged for a shuttle to take us back to the hotel, and the driver was friendly and talkative. This is a must go place for great Italian food whether you reside in Vegas or just visiting make sure this place is on your list.",

Apart from the surreal positioning of being in a booth on the edge of some stranger's party with no real partition other than a walkway, we were impressed by the food and service here. The mostaciolli with marinara is what I ordered, and it was fantastic. Their marinara is very flavorful, which I prefer to the meat sauce, which is a little dry and spicy. They have a decent wine selection if that's your thing. Plus, you can go blast an automatic assault rifle next door afterwards and fulfill your Godfather fantasies. Only in Vegas.",

Here's my quick notes:  Osso Bucco - this is a very rich dish and it came with the bone marrow. Quite impressive.    Cioppino - best fisherman stew ever. The only thing missing was pasta.   Gnocchi - soft pillow but a bit salty with the prosciutto.   Bruchetta - has a very fresh tomato taste to it.   Bellisima Bellini - best I've ever had.   Live music - Frank Sinatra reincarnated. No joke.   Bottom line -  very cool place.",

I love that they have a True Italian atmosphere with the piano and singers, the authentic food, and it's pretty loud which reminds me of being in an Italian house! The only complaint I have which has nothing to do with the restaurant overall is I wish the people that are their dressed up a little more half of the place is dressed very nice the other half is in leggings and hoodies it just kind of brought the class of the place down a bit for me. But other then the atmosphere you can not go wrong with the food!",

    "text": "Just returned home from a week long trip out there and had to take the time to write a review on this gem of a restaurant. Although this place is always packed, the staff is always courteous, knowledgeable and treat you like you are a member of the family. The atmosphere is a time warp with a flare of modern. The walls are adorned with old pictures of Vegas and across from the bar are large flat screen TVs that rotate through pictures of how Vegas use to look as well as faces from the past. Now my favorite part, the food! On this visit I started with the arancini (rice balls) and bruschetta with buffalo mozzarella. I could eat both of these appetizers everyday and not get bored. For my entree I had the veal cannelloni. This was the best cannelloni I have ever had and will definitely be ordering it in the future. My last visit was unique in that the restaurant has opened Tiki Di Amore on the back patio. It was relaxing and a great way for our group to sit together and enjoy a drink before heading back to the strip. If you are visiting in town or a local to Vegas this place is a mandatory for dinner.",

    "text": "Great Entertainment, great bartender, strong drinks but the food is average and they should be ashamed of their prices.   We've been here dozens of times over the years and they are so nice that we've never wrote a bad word but enough is enough.   We went on Friday night and had the pretty damn good garlic loaf and a thin, kinda soggy pizza. Our friend picked up the check for driving him home so I don't know what it all coat. We returned the favor and took him back to Casa Di Amore on Sunday.   We had:  Two Jack and cokes, one small pepperoni pizza, and a slice of lasagna. IT WAS SIXTY DOLLARS!   The lasagna was $24 with a small caesar salad! How do they sleep at night? The pizza was just okay but the lasagna wasn't good, It was small and had little to no meat... $21 ala cart, add $3 for a tiny caesar salad. What could be in there to constitute that price? This was JUST a slice! Maybe 5\"x5\". That leaves 11 more servings in a pan right? What's that $250.00 for a pan of lasagna???   This is the main reason we never eat Italian out and if we do, we'll just split a pizza.  We will go back but only late night, order no food, have some over priced cocktails, watch the great entertainment. We do love the thick old Vegas vibe here.  To be fair a lot of Italian joints like Bootleger Bistro and Capos are priced about as ridiculous. We don't often eat there either. If we are going to spend $21, it aint going to be on $1 worth of pasta, cheese and tomato sauce.",

The musician even came to our table, and asked for any requests.  Everyone was supper friendly from our host, waitress, and bartender.  Yet, the food was the big star. We had the Chicken Parmesan, Osso Bucco, and a Ghnocci side. Everything was amazing, and the portions were very generous.  This place probably has the best Chicken Parmesan in Las Vegas.  The cheese on top was creamy, while the chicken underneath was crispy with just the right amount of marinara sauce.  There was no need for a knife with the Osso Bucco, and it just melted in my mouth.  I couldn't stop eating it.  The flavor was rich, meaty, yet light and buttery at the same time.  It had the perfect balance. The Ghnocci hands down was the best I ever had, anywhere! We had it with the meat scauce, which I was impartial to (due to a herb flavor I personally don't enjoy).  Overall, amazing experience from the food to the ambience.  Most definitely recommend, and most definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Flattering original review (see below) ... complete with venue backstory ... but ... UPDATE: Houston, we have a problem.  I dropped in one recent weekday evening around midnight. I ordered the 16 ounce bone-in Ribeye Sinatra (again), medium rare.   What I got was a 10 ounce, no-bone, zero-marble cut of meat. I am pretty durn sure I was passed off a sirloin strip instead. OK, MAYBE the cook trimmed out the bone ... but that would have to have been a HUGE bone. And where's the marbling?  And it was dry. Really, really dry. Dry like chew-chew-chew dry. The exact opposite of juicy. Dry. Desert dry. I say again, dry.  And, under oath and penalty of perjury, I testify there was SOME pink in there to be seen, but really the steak was cooked to the far side of full-on medium. And it even tasted a bit sour; let's hope the day-shift hadn't already written-off this hunk of meat as too far out-of-date.   So we are talking wrong and/or bad cut of meat ... and cooked wrong, to boot.  Now I am wondering if my slab of ribeye actually landed somewhere else, given one was already paid for. By me.  Oh, and there was no waiter. He/she had apparently been cut and so the bartender - while trying to appease about 10 drinkers/players at the video poker bar - also had to appease me. Given he might miss a winner's sweet tip due to being too inattentive at the VP bar, I was fortunate he worked to give me most all the attention I required. But a scrambling bartender does not equal a waiter. And, as I said, not fair to the bartender either.  And what a racket! Blasting some kind of crazy hip-hop rock nonsense (instead of music) that could only be appropriate for mentally blurring the VP players into dropping more money.  After soda, salad (a $3 add-on) tax and tip, I was out-the-door for well over $50. At that price, this quality of steak & service & ambiance was just a flat-out fail.  And perhaps that is why the next booth over (the only other occupied booth in the house) they were splitting a loaded 18\" pizza (that did look tasty) that was coming in at about $12.50 due to a late-night, half-off deal. Instead of ordering from the full dinner menu.  I thought about sending the steak back, but instead decided to just tough it out (pun intended) then take a pass on CdA for a while ... and give it a chance to smooth over these jagged edges. In the meantime, I've pulled a star back ... and started noting other all-night dining venues of merit.",

They had us sit at the bar for an hour for a reservation at 7:30 and we arrived at 7:10. We left and went to Pasta Mia up the street better entertainment way better service. It's sad cuz I really wanted to try this place. They really need to expand into a bigger space if they are going to make that many reservations plus half the people sitting at 2 seater booths were only there to hear this guy sing and have a drink. Like really we came to eat here not drink but that's all we did since there is nowhere to sit to eat and they insist you sit at the bar till you are seated and they don't check up on you about your reservation to make sure you don't leave.",

Just walked in randomly one day with a couple friends bc we were in the mood to try a new place. Right when you walk in, the atmosphere is so inviting and you immediately get that old school Italian vibe. Their table side manner and service is impeccable. We lucked out bc they had a live band that night and it was like getting dinner AND a show; so cute to watch the older couples dance while you enjoy your dinner and wine. Great spot for birthdays, dates, or just when you feel like getting that personalized service.",

She was like omg so sorry we ran out of tortillas so that's why you never got your meal....ughhh...i said it was fine she offered to get me something else but by then i was over it and just asked for a bloody Mary.

The food was delicious (we got the gnocchi and the eggplant parmigiana). Both were excellent. And the garlic bread is not to be missed.  There's a live band playing in the background, adding to the already warm/family/old-school atmosphere.  And the service was top notch. Annie was super friendly and attentive. Another server, Todd, made us feel right at home as well. He even hooked us up with a fresh loaf of bread as he put our leftovers into carry out containers! The little things like that made us feel like we were truly welcomed.  Looks like a lot of locals come here which is always a good sign. Will definitely be back!",

The service was also fantastic! They also offer a limo that will pick you up and drop you off at your hotel! My GF and I shared a 1lb pasta bowl that was perfect for 2.

Real meat or cheese ravioli instead of the pretentious spinach or Swiss chard type you get at the high-end Strip Italian restaurants. Atmosphere is very old school with posters of Vegas as it used to be. The dining room feels a bit cramped and service can be slow. The bar at the back diminishes the place a little, because its appearance and the crowd it attracts remind one of a sleazy dive from the 70's.   Singer/keyboard player Doug and 83-year-old violinist Bill entertained on Sunday night and were excellent - both very talented guys and not too loud.  The biggest drawback for tourists is that it is located a good long way from the Strip. It's right next door to The Gun Store, making it a good place to complete your Vegas Mafia Experience after trying out that machine gun you've been itching to get your hands on. ;)",

    "text": "Okay, so first off, I'm an Italian from NY who has been in Vegas for 2 years and I'm still in search of an Italian restaurant that I can frequent.  My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner and because we had $20 off with our new entertainment book that we just got recently.    Normally I have no problem paying a little more for food, provided it is good.  SO, I'd have to say that I'm really glad we had a $20 off coupon to eat here.    The food itself is deserving of 2 stars but I gave the place 3 stars because it's cute inside and Brad, our server, was really nice.  My hope for him is that he will someday wait tables at a place that actually serves decent food.  So, on to the actual food..  We started out with fried calamari, which was pretty good.  The sauce that came with was actually decent as well. No issues here.  I ordered Eggplant Parm and my husband is a Chicken Parm fan.. For the money they charge for the entrees, $19 and $24 respectively, I would have hoped for more food.  Italian food is all about portions, and of course flavor, but you won't get rave reviews from me unless you actually FEED ME... Casa di amore didn't do this well.  My husbands chicken came with a steak knife, which, most people eating chicken parm would need.. My dinner also came with a steak knife.. first thoughts were \"Why the hell would I need a steak knife for eggplant? I should be able to eat this with just a fork, no problem.\" BOY WAS I WRONG. Holy crap I could barely cut with it the steak knife it was so hard. With the time it took for them to actually COOK the meal, it should have been mush on the plate. Definitely NOT impressed with this at all.  I'm starting to think that the reason why there are no good Italian places in Vegas is because all of the REAL Italians stayed in the Tri-State area.",

    "text": "Casa Di Amore was a great experience and a nice Italian dinner.  We chose Casa Di Amore based on reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor.    What really sealed the deal for us to go here was the free \"limo\" ride.  The limo is technically a limo, but it basically had seating for 4 comfortably or 6 a little tighter.  Either way, it saved about $40 in cabs so it was very welcome.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall on Tropicana and shares space with a gun store.  It felt like a real locals joint.    The atmosphere wasn't anything special.  There were old Las Vegas pictures and paintings on the wall and a keyboard player was singing Christmas tunes.  I usually hate music when I'm eating, but it was not obnoxious and added to the night.  Everything tasted as if it was made by a friends mother.  For my main course I shared a fantastic Chicken Piccata and Gnocci Bolognese.  Sharing is not only fun, but it's a good way to sample the flavors and not to overeat - something that happens a bit too often.  Casa Di Amore was a very home style type dinner.  It's another nice off the beaten path Italian restaurant in Vegas.  The last time I went a little out of the way for Italian was to Nora's, which was phenomenal.  Nora's is pretty popular and crowded since it's been featured on the Travel Channel.  If you've been there and done that and want another local Italian joint Casa Di Amore is another good option.  The food was very good, but not the best ever.  The decor was nothing fancy, but everything was good and fun.  I'd rate this above average but not great.",

She was really surprised when the limo showed up and took us to the restaurant.    This place is great.  Very old school.  Wine bottles are 1/2 off on Sundays and Mondays.   So we started with the special appetizer.  Crostinis with buffalo mozz and prosciutto topped with roasted red peppers... MMMMM!!!   For my dinner I ordered the Osso Buco.  Holy crap.  I had never had it before.  The best meal that I have ever eaten.  And I eat a lot!  This was the best experience I've ever had in Vegas.  If I ever go back out, I'll definitely be hitting this place again.   With appetizer, 2 dinners, dessert and a half price bottle of wine it was about $110 without the tip. Little pricey, but definately worth it.  Plus the limo ride to and from was free! (I did tip the driver though)",

The seating was ridiculous.  my wife and I were sitting so close to other guests, that we could've eaten off of their plates.  I had hopes in the \"homemade\" noodles only to be let down.  Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.  Let this be a lesson to you casa di amore, stop screwing your customers.",

I hate to say this about a place that I use to just love and thought that not only the food but the atmosphere was first rate.  Tonight ended my love affair with Casa.  This was the 3rd time over the past year that I was really disappointed with the food .  Granted the atmosphere still has people flocking to it but there are just to many fabulous restaurants in Vegas to go to and the quality in my opinion has really been compromised.  What did it.  To start with was the salad. In my opinion they must have prepared it well ahead of time and then refrigerated it.  Why, because the cheese and salami that make part of the base were basically frozen to the plate.  Yes, stuck and hard to peel away from the plate and finally when biting into it you could tell it was frozen.  Finally, the steak my wife ordered was way overcooked.  The waitress apologized but didn't make an effort to ask whether she wanted another.  Well, finally the service was slow as if they were understaffed.  We didn't complain about anything because we both knew that this was the end of an era.  I don't know whether ownership or management has changed but the quality has gone down hill and I haven't even mentioned my order.",

The Fettuccine Alfredo with Lobster is out of this world good, and so is the Linguine with clams.",

It's off of the strip so you don't have the loud noise of the casino atmosphere in the background. They'll also come pick you up in a limo if you request (for free I believe). The food was absolutely delicious, but what made this visit special was our waiter. Brad was the best waiter I think I have ever had at a restaurant! He was very attentive but not overly in your face. He was very professional but fun. Overall I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to any and everyone!",

    "text": "Last night was the third time my girlfriend and I have been here.  On my first visit, my thought was, \"it's pretty pricey for a small portion of macaroni.\"  Macaroni is cheap, except for here.  But we enjoyed the authentic Italian, homey atmosphere and most especially the live music. We chalked up the (too) high price to the added ambiance.  The food is good as in decent but nothing extraordinary.  And it certainly isn't great enough for the price.  Last night we ordered the sea bass special.  We both love sea bass and have had great sea bass in town.  We got a VERY small steak-like piece of sea bass, twice baked potato that was very small, a few broccoli florets and a few julienne pieces of roasted peppers (I believe).  The plate was $40.  I order the sea bass at Don Vito's which is more than twice that size, possibly 3 times, it is luscious (light, buttery like sea bass is) for $38.  The sea bass last night was much more dense and firm like halibut.  It was tasty but had I seen the plate before I ordered, I would have never ordered it.  Before I arrived there and knew of the special, I was kind of set on the Pasta Alla Forno (penne with chicken, shrimp, broc, mushrooms in a light pink sauce baked with mozz).  Sounds yummy, eh?  I imagine it could have been.  The sea bass wasn't much so I ordered still the Alla Forno to take home, thought I would have it for the next couple days lunches.  At $30 for the plate of macaroni, I expected a good size portion.  I was stunned when I got home and opened the plastic bag.  There was so little macaroni that I could see the bottom of the silver tin they package to go items in. No two lunches there.  When I got ready to eat it today, I literally dissected the dish to search for the shrimp - 4 tiny pcs maybe the size of my thumb nail, count the broccoli florets- 1 sm floret and 2 fragments and the penne - 50.(I do have pictures of all that I will post.)    Here is the bottom line:  the food is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced.  If paying a lot for the food is worth it for the ambiance, then I think you will find the food decent and love the music.  The ambiance is the ONLY reason we will go there on rare occasion.  If you could careless about the music and just want some good food for a decent price, this is NOT your place.  Since the closing of Tivoli Gardens, Nora's would be my favorite.  My favorite dish there is $20 (which I still think is overpriced) and in ways similar to the All Forno.  But I definitely get two meals out of it, way tastier and you don't have to hunt for the shrimp.  Full size shrimp.",

Go back in time with old fashioned homestyle red sauce Italian cuisine in huge portions, with a crooner singing Frank Sinatra songs on a PA system, and pictures of the 1960's strip as atmosphere. This is not modern Italian cuisine. However, prices are not 1960's.  $11 for one small canole - but, as the waited points out, you get a free T-shirt with a quote from the Godfather on the back (even if you don't want it). I thought the prices were way too high for the mediocre quality. There are better Italian restaurants in LV - even ones of this type (like Bootleg Bistro).",

I started off with Shrimp Cocktail with this amazing cocktail sauce that had a large clump of horseradish in the middle.....mmmm..mmmm..good. My sinus were cleared immediately. The Ceasar Salad was good. I could taste the anchovy's in the dressing. The entree was Veal Marsala. This was to die for.  Thin slices of perfectly cooked veal in this mushroom gravy.  I didn't leave anything on my plate. The next visit to Vegas, I will be having Italian at this place.  Don't let me forget to give \"props\" to the lounge singer, George.

It started out great with their limo picking us up at our hotel (Aria). If you call them far enough in advance, they may have their limo pick you up and take you back to a strip hotel. There is no charge but make sure you tip the diver. He was great and picked up and dropped us off in style.   The atmosphere is fun in the style of \"Old Vegas\" meaning pictures of Sinatra on the wall and live music every night. It is very lively and loud. The dress is casual.   I am a New Yorker born, raised and currently living. Good Italian restaurants are the norm in NY but I couldn't wait to try some of their dishes after some of the rave reviews. Well, The 6 of us had some starters and 6 different mains. The chicken parm., chicken florentine and the other standards were all fine. But just fine-not more.   The service also was fine-but not more. And yes-the desserts were fine-but not more. I will say the wine list was above average.   It can also be a pricey evening depending upon what you order.  I would still recommend Casa Di Amore if you want to get off the strip for a meal and experience a little \"Old Vegas.\" It's a good change from some of the more upscale restaurants on strip. If you are in Vegas for 3 nights or more, make this one of your dinner stops and enjoy the limo ride!",

Every server we've had is the perfect mixture of professional but casual and fun; they make you feel like you're a regular, even if it's your first time dining. They have a live duo singing classic hits, and tons of cool vintage Vegas pictures that are neat to check out. The lobster ravioli is one of my favorites.",

The service was less than pleasing. After our main course, we were going to order dessert, but ended up not. We sat for 30 mins with empty glasses and no one even acknowledged we were still sitting there. We finally get asked if we want a dessert menu and at this point I am so annoyed, all I want is to leave. I don't think I will be coming back again no matter how good the food is. If you do come here, the food is not disappointing at all! It is truly delicious, but I don't recommend sitting in the booths by the bars if you want service.",

This is a small free standing restaurant near the airport and when you walk in, you know its a long time joint.   I ordered the baked clams as an appetizer and was blown away as to how fresh, hot and exactly like home they tasted. They were prepared perfectly and tasted fantastic. Yum.  Next up was linguine luciano, which was linguine and sauteed calamari in a fra diavlo marinara. I was in the mood for fried calamari, so i asked my server / bartender if they could do it fried. She checked and the answer was yes. Food came and it was a steaming hot, generous portion of fresh fried calamari and linguine in the perfect balance of fra diavlo sauce that was not sitting in a bed of liquid. Again, so perfect and tasted so east coast, i was in heaven.  Sat at the bar for my meal, listened to the nightly house jazz / sinatra band which was the perfect atmosphere for this place. I will be back!!!",

It has music and looks lovely and like it may have come out of the 50's. The people are nice and Toni our server from Brooklyn just wonderful. The food is mediocre at best. The ingredients that go into making up their food is lacking quality and are not the best. We ordered some appetizers, calamari was good, shrimp was doughy and the escarole tasted more like broccoli. The wife got the Osso Bucco, just ok, not a great flavor and the Risotto that came with it was rice-a-roni at best. I had the Veal Parmigiana, tender but again it lacked flavor, no taste because again the quality of the ingredients are not that good. My other friend got Moscatelli pasta and it was dry and something you would expect at an Olive Garden. All in all, this is probably equivalent to a Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. I'm sorry, we had high hopes for this place, but it just didn't satisfy our palates. I would not return. There are to many other great places such as the Italian American Club, Trattoria Reggiano or Sicilliano's,",

The music here is EXTREMELY loud!!!! Not average like it says, making everyone have to yell in the restaurant creating an aggravating buzz and it's not romantic having to scream to my husband especially over \"When the saints go marching in\" is being screamed in my ear...that is not an ideal song to play in a romantic setting?? The service was super slow, we didn't get bread til 25 mins in and then had to wait 15+ mins before he came back to take our order and over an hour from when we sat down to get our entrees. Anyway it left me feeling very annoyed bc of the loudness of it I didn't even feel like conversating bc my husband had to lean in and kept saying \"Whaaat?\"",

Got a call right when they were supposed to pick us up asking us to grab a cab & they'd reimburse us (took the $17 right off of our bill).  Kinda small inside so definitely make a reservation - but it's dark like those old school Hollywood club/restaurants - not sure what anyone means about the mobster feel.    We ordered (2) sets of Osso Bucco & (1) stuffed pork chop.  Tony (our waiter) came back and said the chef didn't like the condition of the Osso Bucco & didn't want to serve it...so I ordered the flambed rib eye & my friend ordered the special of the day filet mignon w/ marsala sauce & mushrooms.  EVERYTHING WAS YUMMY, the filet literally didn't need a knife, rib eye was juicy & medium rare as requested, pork chop was stuffed w/ delicious goodness & all at great pricing.    We even got a recommendation on wine from Tony & grabbed a bottle of 2008 Mac Murray Pinot Noir @ 1/2 price bottle (Sundays/Mondays) for $21 instead of $42.    We had the Pistachio gelato dessert which was delicious too but kinda sweet for us.  We were serenaded most of the night by two men...but only remember the name of the 80+ years old violinist Bill...who's fiddler fingers just flew all over the strings.  AMAZING!  Definitely coming back here in  August on my next LV trip.",

    "text": "My wife is a cookbook author and food critic / blogger - so we eat out at fancy restaurants at least once or twice a week, and are very critical of the places we go.  As we are always eating out and looking for another hidden gem for her to write about, we tend not to frequent any restaurant unless it is way better than average.  I proposed to my wife at this restaurant almost 5 years ago, and it is incredibly rare if we are at Casa less than once or twice in a month.  The drinks are good, the wine list is acceptable (with half price bottles on Sunday and Monday), the food is SPECTACULAR, and the service is impeccable.  We have never had a bad meal here.  We have dubbed this place \"The Mob Joint,\" as the atmosphere is very \"Old Vegas.\"  The decor is straight out of 1960's Vegas, and the brick walls are lined with pictures from the days of Frank and Sammy.  The booths and tables (lined in white linen) are dimly lit, with a romantic ambiance, and the place is just fabulous.  Their nightly entertainment is usually George, who sounds a lot like a young Frank Sinatra, and does a lot of fabulous old crooner tunes, interspersed with some comedy, some show tunes and some Billy Joel.  He is amazing.  The twice wrapped prawns that everyone here seems to be complaining about are great, wrapped in cheese and then baked in a puff pastry dough.  I think that the salty of the shrimp and cheese mixed with the slight tangy of the dough plays really, really well against the super-sweet of the caramel sauce.  (and we save the caramel sauce to drizzle over the ice cream at the end of the meal)  I like this dish quite a bit, though we don't order it every time.  What we DO order every time is their cheese garlic loaf and a side dish of Alfredo sauce for dipping.....Oh My GOD there is nothing quite so sinful.  You simply MUST try it.  Their steaks and stuffed pork chops are what we usually order, and they are beyond superb.  Their Osso Bucco is the best I've ever had.  It is so tender it literally falls from the bone.  The Vodka Shrimp is incredible as well.  Over the years, we've had most of the pasta dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed.   Their prices are on the high side, but nothing that I wouldn't expect to pay at any of the restaurants of this caliber in Vegas.  For us, with a (half price) bottle of wine, the bread loaf, an appetizer to share, side Caesar salads, our meals, and a shared ice cream treat, our bill usually runs about $125 - $150, which is what we generally spend any time we go out for a really nice dinner - and with their portions, we always have some left over for lunch the following day.  My only minor complaint about this place is that their desserts are less than spectacular, as they are currently pre-made off-site. I do love that the waitstaff are all willing to be honest about the desserts they like, and which to avoid (my wife ordered a creme brulee once, and our waiter leaned down and said with a meaningful look, \"I would really recommend the Chocolate-Peanut-Butter Bomba...The creme bruleee is, well, not what you would expect.\").   Fortunately, the last time we were there the Maitre D' mentioned that they were bringing on a pastry chef in the very near future, so now the only problem will be saving ROOM for dessert!  Overall, if you are looking for that perfect little hole in the wall, that will give you the True old Vegas kind of experience, Casa Di' Amore will deliver in a big way.  Oh, and if you call in advance, They even offer complimentary limo service from/to any of the hotels on The Strip!",

It is a great place for any kind of date night, business lunch/dinner, or really anyone who just wants a relaxing dinner with a cozy atmosphere.  They have a nice bar towards the back with a few gaming machines for those who do not prefer a table.  The service was is second to none and with the cabaret style live music, excellent food and great location off the strip, Casa Di Amore is a restaurant I recommend to all locals and tourists for an amazing time!",

    "text": "We were lucky to have gotten in without a reservation on a Tuesday night! Did not feel touristy, but it seemed that most people in the place were not from the area. Loved all the canvases on the wall of Old Vegas--definitely more history than you'll get anywhere on the strip.  The food was good--we split the alfredo and it was a perfect split size. Not very many wines by the glass, and cheaper to order the bottle anyway. Soup and salad does not come with the entree, and I would not recommend spending the extra money--the entree itself was very filling and we had split it! Plus it was nothing that special--chicken noodle \"spin off\" as some others have said.   A few complaints: Our server was sort of kissing up to us, but when it came time to get our bill he was nowhere to be found. They also don't seem to have serving sections, so it would have been hard to grab his attention. Luckily the manager(?) walked by and heard us talking about it so he ran the check for us. Also unsure whether bread comes with the meal--we were not offered any and ordered the garlic loaf instead, but the table next to ours got bread with olive oil and vinegar.   I will give it another chance, but there are other places I'd recommend to out-of-towners.",

The scallops au grautin are to die for, and both our portions were exactly the right amount of food, and we came starving. Their Cesar salad is only an extra $3.00, and pretty large. There was definitely an old vegas feel, and a singer and piano player were there crooning all of us with mostly oldies, but it was so soft it in no way impeded on our conversation. Highly recommend, especially for couples! They also have a bar in the back with sports. Monday night is half off wine night, too.",

It was so loud that it gave me a headache before we ordered the food.The prices are stupid high for what you get. $25 for a bowl of spaghetti with some crappy sauce & some red pepper flakes thrown in (no meat). Add $10 for 5 small Vandecamp style fried shrimps & $5 for a small & I mean small loaf of cheese bread.. I think this place is for stupid tourists that don't know any better. Any steak house at any Station Casino blows this hole out of the water.My wife & I went because our friend gave us a gift certificate. When the waiter realized that we were not impressed & we paid $80.00 of $100 gift certificate including a large tip, He through a $20 bill at us & said \"Lets call it  good\". I don't think they care about locals, they just want the big spending tourists.",

Brad (I think that was his name) was our server and just a delight to talk to (its amazing how nice people are when you smile and are polite...a lesson to the inexperienced diners and all-around rude people out there). He led us to the best dishes on their vast menu (I had the osso buco and garlic cheese bread). He also was very helpful in picking out the ideal glass of Super Tuscan wine.

    "text": "I took my newly proposed-to girlfriend (now fiancee) here for a nice dinner and it was thoroughly enjoyable!  I had made reservations the night before by calling in, although you could probably do them online as well via OpenTable or something like that. We arrived slightly early, but we were seated immediately. I can't remember our waiter's name, but he was fantastic. You could tell he was vastly experienced, as I believe he mentioned he had been working there for 10 years! He got a feel for how much time we had to dine that night (we had around three hours before our show) so he slowed everything down for us so we could enjoy each other's company and the wonderful live music, as well as the overall ambiance of the restaurant.   We munched on the tasty bread and butter that were provided and decided to order some bruschetta to share. The bruschetta was delicious! It's strange how something so simple can taste that good. After a long while we decided to make our entree orders, which were the Gypsy Pasta and the Chicken Marsala. When I told our waiter I wanted the Gypsy Pasta he warned me about how spicy it was and that it was usually not very enjoyable for most people that ordered it. This brought to mind the question of why it was even on the menu, but before I could ask he told me it was because actual gypsies (there were two groups of them dining there at the time) would come in and order it and just love it. In the end, our waiter brought me some of the sauce to sample and, my goodness, it was hot. I promptly ordered some linguini and meatballs with a slightly less spicy sauce!  Our meals were delicious, and my pasta bowl was huge. We had to get boxes to go. It was a great experience. I feel like if I had told someone we had just gotten engaged we probably would have gotten a cannoli or something because there were lots of other people getting them for their birthdays and weddings!  Also, we had the cheesecake with strawberry sauce and it was very good.  To top off the impeccable service, when we first arrived I asked our waiter if it would be possible to use the complimentary limo service to get a ride to the Bellagio where we were going to see \"O\" after dinner. He said he couldn't make any promises, but that it would probably work out. Turns out he procured us a ride, so we got to show up to the Bellagio in a limo. The limo driver was fantastic. He was playing Star Wars music, so we had a nice chat about the new movie.",

    "text": "To quote Jerry Seinfeld: \"See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\". This was the problem this past Sunday evening (and based on reading other previous Yelp reviews, has been an ongoing problem for awhile). Everyone who had made dinner reservations that evening were complaining that they were waiting an hour or more for their table (and to make matters worse, they initially told everyone that it would only be about a 15 to 20 minute delay). Many people were angry about the wait, and they probably lost several customers forever. But putting this mismanagement aside for a second, let me outline the positives of this restaurant: They have pretty good food, the service was fast (once you were finally seated), the atmosphere has that old world Italian charm, and the entertainment (singer/band playing old classics) were very good. The outdoor Tiki bar in the back is also a unique touch, and a great place to hang out, drink, and order food from their bar menu. To summarize, I could have easily given this restaurant a poor 1 or 2 star rating, just based on the reservation screw ups. But I will rate it 3 stars (for now), based on the positives I outlined....and although I would go back, I would never go on any weekend night, or any other time I may think it would busy, because there is a high likelihood you will be waiting a long time for a table, and your dinner reservation will be completely meaningless.",

I love that it's old Vegas themed & our waitress was very friendly & attentive. For the food, I wasn't thrilled. I got the lasagna & my boyfriend got the chicken alfredo both being a little bland. We've both had better of the dishes. Little pricey but that's expected for an Italian restaurant. Overall, descent.",

    "text": "We have been to Vegas, many many times. This is hands down the best experience and food you will have while staying here.  Located about two miles off the strip and just around the corner from our place sits this little whole in the wall.  When you pull up, the first impression you will get is  \"this is what all the rave is about?\" It literally looks like a run down bar with an old door out front that your not sure you want to walk through. The parking can be a bit off putting, but I'll get back to that in a minute. Just find a spot and go in (reservations our highly encouraged) we did not make any and later found out we were very lucky that we even found seats.   So... you walk through this door and are immediately taken aback by the intimate atmosphere.  The waitress asks if we have reservations and we tell her emberaasingly \"no\" she takes our name and say \"go back to the bar, I'll find you when more seats open\" no question or hesitation, we do so. When we arrive to the bar there were no two seats available, a waiter kindly asked a couple to move down one so. My husband and I could sit together (the couple ended up being regulars who we sat and talked with our whole visit at the bar, which was nothing more then 20mins) I actually wished we could have stayed their longer. The bar tender was awesome, she was making a drink that intrigued me, told me it was a mudslide and I said I would take one as well \"she replied with, you can have this one, the floor can wait\" and she gave me a big wink. My kind of gal. My husband had a manhattan, of course.  And we chatted away with the locals who gave us some insight on the the place. The restaurant is open from 5pm-5am, they recommend reservations and too come early for a drink at the bar and play virtual poker or black jack (my cup of tea) there's live music all night long and if your there during late late hours you may see some celebs walking in after their shows.   Moving on to dinner.... our waiter... we never did catch his name, but if you have a chance to encounter him, consider that you'll never have a more wonderful evening. He had us cracking up all night and was wonderful to watch interact with all his other tables. The other servers seemed just as nice, but he stood out the most. One thing we learned is that most of this group have worked at this place for years and it's amazing to see them work together.  Ok ok food: I ordered the Veal Marsala \"delicate and prefecto my husband had the chicken parm, which was rich and amazing. Their red sauce is like no other. I had angel hair with my Veal, perfectly cooked and brought on the side, couldn't have asked for it served any other way. Prior to dinner we had a loaf of bread that were small pieces with garlic butter (my arteries are screaming at me with all the cholesterol) but it was worth it. Between the two of us we couldn't decide if the Cesar or Italian house salad was best, they were both that good!  We need the night with the Spumoni ice cream dipped in chocolate, enough said. Over we had 4 drinks 3 courses and we were out of there with a bill of $131 (tip included)  I would recommend this to any couple and family, great experience.  One last thing we did learn is that they have ride service. They want you to be able to enjoy their amazing wine/drinks and not have to worry about transportation- underutilized but there as an option  Not enough can be said about this place, from the time you walk out there door, they are wonderful, every dang one of them.",

I would have to give it 4-stars for the flavor of the appetizer and main course. For appetizer, we had the twice wrapped prawns. For our main course, I had the chicken piccata with angel hair pasta and my bf had the chicken Parmesan with angel hair pasta.  The food was good with a good portion size.   5-stars for dessert! For dessert, we had the cannoli and the creme brulee. Those were the bomb!

The inside is old school, cozy, and inviting. The lights are dim and live music is playing. We are greeted by a very friendly hostess and taken to a booth, rather than a regular table, after making reservations. Very comfortable and cool. The menu is vast and has a lot of choices. We start with two glasses of the Merlot which is delicious. The bread is warm and absolutely delicious, along with a homemade garlic butter that demands a second serving. I ordered the mini osso bucco which is an appetizer with risotto and it was absolutely delicious. It was impressively flavorful and melted off the bone. My friend ordered a Caesar salad which was fantastic. We both got pasta dishes.  She got the lasagna and I got the mastaciolli, which is like a baked ziti, both with meat sauce. They were good, yet a little too dry, like they may have been over baked. They were still good.  We did not order desert as we were full!  The service is very friendly and the prices are more than reasonable.  Why 4 stars? We are actually giving it 4.5 stars. The main dishes were good, but not great. We will definitely be going back and will try other dishes on the menu.",

The only way to describe my baked lasagna is \"truly horrible.\"  We also had eggplant parmesan.  Not good and super greasy with overcooked pasta.  We tasted our friend's pizza which looked really great - but blech!   The drinks were good though. You need a drink to put up with this place.   The place  was totally packed and really hopping - with lots of tourists and conventioneers, many of whom had started their happy hour experience several hours earlier.  [The restaurant runs a shuttle to/from the Strip.]   It was very crowded and very noisy - with really bad live music that just added to the cacophony.  When you could actually hear the music/singing above the din, well, that was not a good thing either.  The restaurant itself leans a bit towards the \"dive\" end of the restaurant spectrum without exactly being quite that bad.  According to our waiter, it is a favorite hangout spot for gypsy gangs who meet there to plan out their robberies and arsons - and then try to stiff the restaurant on their bill or pay with counterfeit money.  The counterfeit problem is so bad they had to install a machine to scan and detect them.  All of this might have been amusing had the food been good.",

Everyone was singing the hits having a great, festive time.    Let's start with the service. I had the pleasure of getting Stephan as my server, he was very helpful in guiding me to what my taste buds wanted. I ended up getting the appetizer \"Garlic Loaf\" and for my entree, I got the \"Fettuccini Papasito\", creamy and loaded with flavorful sausage. My mouth is watering now! It was wonderful, I can't wait to try other dishes when I return.  I called before I went to Casa Di Amore to see if there was a wait and I also had the pleasure of speaking with Lisa who was helpful with my questions. When I was done eating, I wanted to thank Lisa and she gave me a tour of their new OUTSTANDING huge Tiki bar in the rear.  You have to see it, It's straight out of Hollywood and very comfortable.  I can't wait to bring the work crew back to Casa Di Amore because now, I'm in love!  This place rocks from the top to the bottom.",

I come in and sign in. She said it will be a few minutes.  Fast forward, 25 minutes had passed, and the ppl around me had the same reservation time as me, they were being seated and we kept asking when we will seated.  35 minutes pass and they said there's still 2 more parties ahead of us.  We walked out. We weren't going to wait 1 hour.  How could you reserve a bunch of people under one time slot? You could of told me 7:30 or 7:45.  The manager wasn't very nice and was not very accommodating.  We ended up going to Italian American Club Restaurant not to far away.  Go there if you're waiting a while here.",

Huge portions that is enough to share with several people. My only complaint was that it needed a tad bit more sauce.   We ordered the appetizer sampler and everything on the plate was delicious. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Took couple bites and boxes it up because we had to drive 8 hours home. Warmed it up the next day and it was good but hardly any sauce.

It was our first time there and he gave us a detailed informative tour of the menu. Ordered the mini osso bucco and the spaghetti and meatballs. I highly suggest both and if it's only 2 of you you only need one pasta bowl, it's about a pound of pasta!!  Oh and the garlic loaf is a must. The osso bucco is over risotto and the spaghetti and meatballs were to die for. So much flavor in the meatballs. Definitely will be returning!  I love it here.",

I tried out several items last night and all were top notch!  Started with the chicken noodle soup which was delicious, but I would probably name it, chicken vegetable with noodle. I then tried the appetizer osso bucco (my first time ever). It was really good but had a little meat, along with a good amount of fat, but I think that is the nature of the beast! Mega tender!!! I then tried the Chicken Marsala. This sometimes is a sweet dish, but I checked to see and I was promised it was savory... and it was.... I Liked it very much! Oddly, one of the best parts of the dish was the side of pasta that came with it. I was able to select which pasta I wanted as well as the sauce. I chose angel hair with the meat sauce. It was fantastic! For dessert, I had the creme brulee. It was also tasty. My dentist is Italian and told me it was done of the best Italian he has ever had... I must say I would agree even though I am not Italian. The place has an old Vegas vibe... atmosphere a bit dark. By 6:30 on a Wed night, the place was packed, so many others must agree! I will be back!",

Taking a Lyft or Uber from the strip isn't that bad it's about $13, but if you call ahead they do have a complimentary shuttle service that will pick you up and drop you off!

We were there on 1/2 price bottle of wine night - they don't even need to give half off but they do.   There was also a deal that if you buy a dessert you get a free T-shirt - get out.  The dessert prices were NOT inflated to cover the price of the shirt - they just do it to be awesome.  Tiki bar - not sure who came of with the idea but it's almost the exact opposite of the restaurant.   It makes you smile.  Plenty of seating.  Various nooks and crannies to hide in and enjoy a drink.  I recommend checking it out while you wait or come early and grab a drink.  You can take your drink to your table with you if needed.  The tiki room we sat in made us feel like we were at Disneyland.

I'm a huge cheese fan and this touched all of my buttons. The gnocchi was freshly made and the sauce complimented it perfectly! My husband got the Fruite del Mare. It was perfectly prepared.

    "text": "This is a family favorite of ours. Everything about Casa Di Amore is great from the second you walk in. The walls are lined with old Rat Pack photos and there's live music in the evenings. If I want Italian food, this is where I'm going almost every time. The staff is all very friendly and remembers my family even though they don't live here.   I recommend making a reservation. When you arrive you can hang out in the back where the bar is. They've redone the bar to add more booths so it's a little harder to do this but the whole restaurant is small so there's not much of an option. For starters I've had the bruschetta, calamari, and arancini. We've tried to order the clams a few times but our waiter didn't recommend them because they were apparently small at the time. The calamari is a good choice for a group and the arancini was crispy and creamy. The bruschetta is alright, but they give you a big basket of bread for dinner so it's a little redundant. They'll ask if you want to add any soup or salad to your dinner for a charge but their portions are pretty big so it's certainly not necessary.   For dinner I pretty much always go for the pasta. I've had the gnocci alla prosciutto, fettucini alla pappasito, and pasta alla forno. The fettucini alla pappasito is one of my favorite pasta dishes ever. It's a creamy fettucini dish with chunks of sausage in it. I add a good amount of pepper flakes and everyone that tries it thinks it's the best dish of the night. The pasta alla forno is a close second.   Other than taking family here for a nice dinner, I go to Casa di Amore sometimes as a late night option. It's a lot more casual and we usually sit at the bar. After I think 11pm they have 1/2 off pizzas so we'll usually do that or order a 1 lb pasta bowl to share (penne alla vodka). It's a great  option for late night food where usually your only options are smoky bars or chain restaurants. Casa di Amore is actually open until 5am so you can get there pretty late.   One interesting thing that may be happening is we saw some tiki decorations out in back of the restaurant recently. Rumor has it they'll be opening a tiki bar soon so that will be awesome and add some more room for people waiting for a table or wanting to hang out in a tiki bar. Casa di Amore is easily the coolest part of this part of town.",

    "text": "So I went here on a first date recently and I wouldn't say its a good vibe for that! Lol Its very loud and to top if off they sat a family with a baby right behind us.. so when the singer is there with the loud music its hard to have any conversations here... the sweet sound of baby crying didn't help either. The patrons that come here is also on the loud side. This would be a good place for a large family to come to.. or friends that want to get together and want to be loud. I didn't choose the restaurant for our first date.. but its definitely not a nice romantic italian restaurant.. its more on the loud, bright and non fancy side.   So lets talk about how the place looks.. its not fancy.. kinda bright lighting.. and more on the casual dress side. The service was okay.. Theres also a tiki bar in the outside back patio side of the restaurant which is kinda cool cause its very Hawaiian theme! but they close early back there around 11pm! even though the restaurant is open til 3am.   So the food was alright tasting.. nothing amazing to rave about. I believe I ordered the gnocchi with prosciutto and added grilled shrimp no top of that. It tasted alright but its not something I would order again. The bread and butter at the beginning of the meal was actually pretty tasty! bread was warm and the butter was soft! very delish.  I also ordered moscow mules there and it tasted okay. not overly sweet which i loved.   Oh parking is plentiful and no valet needed. Like I said its a very casual italian restaurant.",

She checked on us several times to ensure we had everything we needed and our drinks were refilled. The musician singing the classics sounded Ike Sinatra. We WILL be back!    Started with the Arancini (rice and cheese balls) with a nice, big, gooey, cheesy center, and ossobuco over risotto. The ossobuco was flavorful and smooth.  The garlic cheese bread had cheese in the center and was delicious with the spaghetti sauce from the Arancini.   The chicken Parmesan was tasty with a nice melty layer of cheese. Couldn't finish it all but really wanted to. The fettuccine alla Pappasito (2 kinds of sausage) was smooth and satisfying. Now, it's time to roll home and go to sleep with a happy and full stomach.",

    "text": "I could of sworn I reviewed Casa Di Amore last year... but nothing here so I am doing a combined reviewed of two visits.  First time I went last year, it was AMAZING.  I would have given it 5 stars for the food, the service, it was all top notch.  There were 3 of us, we were sat in a corner booth and ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees to share.  Even had dessert.  It was all delicious and fabulous.  Service was on point and I enjoyed my wine to top it all off.   Second visit was a few weeks ago.   Unfortunately went with high expectations based on the first visit.  Oddly we were sat in the bar area, which I didn't really care for.  The only advantage to that was our bartender was our server and she was great.    This visit had some highlights and low points.    Highlight was the lobster ravioli.  Was as delicious as the first time.   Low point was the meatballs that came out cold - AND when we asked it to be hot they literally just NUKED the meatballs in the microwave and brought it back out.  Didn't this that was this kind of restaurant.    Highlight was the chicken parmesan hubby ordered.  Low point was my veal parmesan which seemed a bit tough... esp conidering it was veal.  Overcooked maybe?  I dunno.    The old school Vegas feel was still there and we mostly enjoyed our dinner, but those were some odd things like microwaved meatballs.   Lastly, we made our reservation through Open Table and the restaurant told Open Table we never showed up.  So I get some kind of note from Open Table in which I have to \"explain\" myself that we were there with the bill to show as proof if need be.  Yeah... just a little irritating to a dinner that was already just about 3 stars.  Hopefully they fix their little quirks.",

Toni Girl greeted us quickly and professionally making our group of 8 feel important and welcomed.   The ample parking was a plus and the Resturant has a nice visual appeal from the outside. As we walked in, the decor and ambiance was spectacular. I felt transported to a time when the \"Rat Pack\" was the hit of Vegas and the patrons inside were part of some big event in town. We felt under dressed but they extended a warm welcome regardless.   We ordered water and drinks and was amazed at how quickly it was served. Appetizers of lobster ravioli, calamari, prosciutto, and bread was plentiful and absolutely tasty- The music of the 50-60's was so appropriate and lighting perfect, creating an ambiance of calm and delight.  The food came out so quick as well and words just can't explain how delicious the dishes were. I really did enjoy my stuffed pork chops dish. The pork was tender and flavorful. My friend did enjoy their pasta and seafood dishes.   Overall, my experience here was amazing with the staff being so pleasant and attentive to our needs. Foodies, this place is a must try- you won't be disappointed!",

We had veal francese and chicken parm, and both were very mediocre. I would say for this type of \"Italian\", go to Olive Garden. You will get better food quality, and your check will be cut in half.

This place isn't called Casa Di Amore - it's called Casa Di Ashole.   I came here with my parents, my husband, and my baby. The two hostesses working tonight (Friday 4/7) initially quoted us a 30 minute wait. In the 4 seconds it took us to decide that we would go for it, the bald burly black guy in a coat (general manager?) walked over and discreetly shook his head at the hostesses.   Suddenly, the two girls were then telling us that they weren't taking walk ins. We were probably looking really confused because they back tracked and then said \"well we would have to push two tables together because you have a baby\". Literally being turned away because of my child.   The manager stood there blankly staring at the hostesses making sure they do their job in sending us on our way. He did not even look at us. We turned around to walk out and one of the girls said \"sorry! Try another night!\" I think she felt bad but either way I'm highly annoyed and offended by our experience.   We went to Sergio's down the street and it was AMAZING. Such great service and amazing Italian food.",

They use to rep the NY Giants during football season, but I don't remember seeing the flag out this past year.  When people ask me my favorite Italian food in Vegas, unless I know they are looking for a fancy strip environment, I recommend Casa Di Amore. Once you walk through the doors, you forget you just walked in a small restaurant off Tropicana. Dim lighting, attentive staff, and classic Italian food that reminds me of my grandmother on the east coast.  Some of my favorite dishes include linguine and clams, eggplant di amore, chicken picatta, and the appetizer of a mini osso bucco with risotto. The risotto is always cooked to perfection. I always add a house salad because their home made dressing is to die for. If I can't make up my mind, I stick with a basic spaghetti and meatballs. Perfect, classic comfort dish.  They have a bar, but right now it is under construction so they are only serving beer and wine. I can't wait to come see the newly remodeled lounge area once they are done.  I love the feeling I get when I am here. Everything is exactly how an Italian restaurant should be. Welcoming and comfortable with amazing food.",

I would prefer to spend an evening at Casa Di Amore than any restaurant on the Vegas strip, hands down the very best authentic Italian food and friendliest staff. The restaurant is recently renovated but none of the 1950's flair was lost, actually, it was enhanced. Can't say enough about the fun, relaxed atmosphere.  Last Visited June 2017",

The staff from the limo driver to the hostess to the servers are all impeccably personable and make for a wonderful dining experience. Is it the best food I've ever had? No. But the pasta is delicious and it's the experience that you have when you get to Casa Di Amore that makes it so memorable. You feel like you've stepped into a neighborhood haunt in Vegas with a large Italian community and many diners celebrating life's milestones. It's cozy, charming, and somewhat tacky but in the best way. The live music is great. We highly recommend a visit to Casa Di Amore on your visit to Vegas. PS -- try the Gypsy pasta and tri-flavored ice cream dessert. Yummo!",

A neighbor from \"JOISEY\", highly recommended this place so my wife and I tried it out a few months ago. This is my follow up review. I am not surprised that this joint gets all these rave reviews from millennial diners! I will say that I am a DALLAS NATIVE (1941 - 1988) that has \"traveled the world\" and KNOW what a fine dining experience is. Casa Di Amore has to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. The room is so dark that you need a flashlight to read the menu and the OVERPRICED food is MEDIOCRE at best. I don't care about \"atmosphere\" (dining in the dark), I DO CARE about the food. I guarantee you, you can get a 100% better dining experience for a fraction of the cost and be able to SEE what you are eating at any OLIVE GARDEN.",

Loved the live entertainment with music from Sinatra, Dion, and a variety of 50's and 60's groups!  Lots of locals so you know they're doing something right.  Poker machines at the bar and generous pours make this a great place to enjoy drinks and dinner before hitting the casinos; or make a night of it - their hours are 5 PM to 5 AM (not a typo).

Boy was I was missing out.  This is totally my type of place.  You walk in the door and are instantly transported to Old Vegas.  I had a drink at the bar while waiting for my friend.  They were playing Motown, the bartender was friendly and my drink (lemon drop) was great.  I could have hung out there all night.  I seriously want to become a regular here.  Eventually my friend arrived and we were seated in a large booth.  We started with a couple drinks, Chocolate Martini for me, Italian Gatorade for her.  Both were delicious.  For our mains we ordered the Famous Garlic Loaf, Penne Pesto and Baked Mostaccioli.  Food was fantastic.  I've been craving it ever since.  Service was good and before we left live music started playing.  This might be my new favorite restaurant.",

As for parking, we didn't have any problems finding one. They have parking on the side and also in the back of the restaurant. When you walk into the restaurant, it has a really nice feel to the place. The lighting is not to bright, people are having a good, there's live jazz music and it all just makes you wanna eat good food lol...   There menu is just like any other Italian restaurant and you can look them up online. There price ranges anywhere from $13 to $45 depending on what you get. I went with the Cioppino ($38) which is a house favorite. If you like seafood, I recommend it!   It's a dish packed with lobster, clams, mussels, scallops, crab and shrimp. I added some pasta to it as well. The portion is pretty nice.   The staff there is really welcoming and overall I thought it couldn't have gone any better. Well unless if it was free but who are we kidding lol. If you're in the area, go check out Casa Di Amore.",

They started making their pasta portion really small and since it isn't handmade fresh pasta and cost most of them over 20$ or  30$ if you order it with sea food, so for me is not ok. Think that a good brand of Italian pasta cost them less than a dollar. The service on the other end is one of the best you could ever get in Las Vegas and that's why of the 3 star.",

    "text": "I finally got to try this place out - after having wanting to have gone my past two trips to Vegas.  Res. at 8:30 on a Friday night and the limo was available for pickup at Mirage.  Dunno how we lucked out, but we did.  Well, we weren't seated til 9:15 or so.  This was a little ridiculous.  Fortunately we chatted up a few others around the bar.  Other than that, everything went well.  The vibe is nice, but the dude they had singing was a bit much.  Our waiter was outstanding.  This is what service should be like in the most expensive city in the US to eat in.  We (5 guys) did an order of mushrooms and calimari to start off with.  Mushrooms were great and the calimari was THE best i've had, to date.  Dinner comes and my veal parm is great.  a lil pricey at $30, but it was also the best I've had.  The cheese was melted perfectly - starting to turn brown to give that extra little crisp.  Our limo driver was ok at best.  He didn't really say much of anything even tho I tried shooting the shit with him when he picked us up.  But, for a free ($15 tip) cab ride I didn't complain.  Worth a stop if the limo is available.",

    "text": "Amo la Casa di Amore! (in english: I love \"house of love\")  Honestly we ended up here because of the free limo rides they offer.    Best. Marketing. Idea. Ever.    Ok.. in a long time at least... and I'm sure they are cheaper to operate to draw the tourists in than it would be to have built that place on the strip and pay the strip rent premiums.  Pretty genius...   I still scoped reviews  to make sure I wouldn't regret giving up my holiday time to a restaurant with a limo if it wasn't worth it.  Needless to say the reviews were glowing and we booked our limo/reservation.  Limo ride was fun.  Obviously retired by a regular limo company and bought by the restaurant as it's a little run down and not the height of luxury anymore... but it's still a sweet ride and we felt quiet VIP on a trip over the to restaurant.   Obviously the limo isn't REALLY free - you'll have to tip but it's still got to be less than a cab and way more awesome and a cheap way to have the limo experience in vegas.   The restaurant has some great atmosphere to it - very mobster and old vegas.  There was live music playing and it felt very romantic.  Everyone is very nice and service was top notch.   I settled on garlic bread and the 1lb spagetti with meatless balls (yes... a whole pound... you'll need to share or take a doggie bag).  ZOMG - it was delicious!   I eat a lot of pasta and frankly the food is usually consumed and as quickly forgotten but this stuff was so good and completely stands out as great pasta.  Meatless balls were great - even my meat loving sweetie enjoyed them.  I wished I could have teleported the contents of my stomach out (or subsequently gone back in time 30 minutes while maintaining my memories) just to eat a second helping of both the bread and pasta. I ate way more than I should have and I'm not sure how I found room for dessert but I'm glad I did.   The cannoli was to die for (maybe not literally... can't tempt a mobster right?).  I've since read you get a t-shirt for ordering the cannoli but that wasn't offered to me that night so i'm not sure what the deal with that is :(.  The night we were there they had 50% off bottles of wine which was very good since the bottles were all reasonably priced to begin with and needless to say we left a little giddy for a couple reasons.     Prices are decent but not inexpensive and more than worth it.  You'll be able to find a couple promos and coupons around for these guys but you can't stack those on top of special pricing like discounted bottles of wine so I'd find a couple coupons and do some math to figure out the best promo for you on the day you go as sometimes the in restaurant deal might trump the coupons available.   With tips we still did better cost wise than a couple dinner buffets and drinks on the strip and had more fun and enjoyed the food much more.   The limo was ready almost immediately after we paid... everything was amazing and I can't wait to return next trip down there and tell all my vegas bound friends back home about this little gem.",

    "text": "We looked on Google for the best Italian restaurants in Vegas and it gave us Casa Di Amore as one of the search results. As it is pretty close to our hotel, we decided to choose here for dinner. When we first walked in, we quickly realized just how eclectic the personalities of everyone working there were. It seemed like they all had great senses of humor, yet still keeping things classy like a classic Italian restaurant should have. The Food was excellent (I recommend the classic spaghetti and meatballs), and they had classic Vegas live music the Saturday we went as well. For dessert we had cannoli, which was fantastic. Overall a very satisfying Italian experience in an old style Vegas restaurant.",

    "text": "Last night, I went out with my sister in law and some friends to the club. After a long night of dancing, we had DEFINITELY worked up the appetite to eat a good meal, so we stopped here at the Casa Di Amore restaurant.   Let me start off by saying how LATE we were coming; we went around 3:30 and the bartender (I believe), Brian (or Bryan) was getting ready to close after what seemed to be a long night. He decided to let us dine in and extremely sweet about it. I have to commend someone who is so willing to risk a little more of their late night to please a few strangers. Brian has reminded me of why I'm a people person.   The service was incredible to say the least. I had the Philly Cheesesteak Sliders. They came with wonderfully made fries and I had a lemon water. On the side, we all had warm bread and butter.   The meal was delicious and Brian came by to check on us periodically to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The setting and the lighting of the restaurant is gorgeous and romantic for any couple who may consider going (including my man and myself).   Thank you so much, Brian. You are an outstanding server and person. If you haven't gotten one already, it's definitely time for your promotion!!",

    "text": "ATMOSPHERE:  Aside from the perimeter of booths, the tables are so close together in one big room it feels a little like a beer hall or cafeteria, so it feels a little crowded and loud.  However, the Love Shack gets props for being too dark to see the prices and very old school Vegas/Italian. I can't imagine going on a night without the live entertainment which made the experience.    The night we went it was one older black guy and one older white guy singing mostly 70s easy rock and R&B covers. They should call themselves \"Grey\".  \"Hi, I'm white\" \"And I'm black\", \"And together we're Grey\".  SERVICE:  Great, but it's the kind of place that gets super busy, so we ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees all at the same time just in case.    DRINKS:  Not weak. And the bar has video poker/keno/blackjack. And if you want to eat in the bar, they will give you something that looks like a cutting board with high heel clogs.  LIMO/VAN:  You better reserve that in advance.  We missed the limo, but the manager hooked us up and sent us home in the shuttle as we stumbled out.  FOOD:  We shared the bruschetta.  The bread was kinda crouton-ish, but interesting and yummy.  The meatballs (a side for $4) were perfect.  I made the mistake of ordering the gypsy sauce even though I was told that on a scale from 1 to 10 in spiciness it was a 15.  It was like someone dumped a whole red pepper flake shaker into it.  I sweated throught it, and the server gave me some McDonald's coffee to cool my mouth down.",

The food quality of this restaurant is marginal, at best. I ordered the lasagna tonight. It literally was so bland and flavorless, two bites was all I could stand, and I forced the second bite. Frozen lasagna from your local grocery store has more flavor. The garlic loaf didn't really taste like garlic. More like hot melted cheese and grease bread.  After deciding I didn't want to try anything else. They brought out a cannoli and sang happy birthday. Truth be told, the birthday song was cheesy and the cannoli was even worse. The filling was gritty and frankly, really bad. It was like the fitting finish to a really really bad meal. The whole dining experience was poor. I had high hopes for this restaurant. I ended up getting a refund from the manager, but I more than likely won't be back nor will I recommend this spot to anyone else",

I had the special filet mignon tips with gnocchi and gorgonzola sauce- it was amazing with fresh basil. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly which is hard to find, sauce wasn't to heavy and steak was cooked to medium. My husband had the flamade steak (may not be spelling this right) and he enjoyed it. Double espresso and tiramisu for dessert was good. The tiramisu had extra chocolate sauce on top which seemed to much/heavy for us. We had a nice dinning experience and definitely will come back.",

We didn't have reservations, but were seated quickly and our waitress promptly introduced herself and began serving us.  There was live music, and at first it seemed to add to the noise of the crowded restaurant, but after we settled in, the songs flowed naturally into the background. It added a nice touch to the atmosphere. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so it was hard to choose any one thing. Even just the bread provided at the beginning was enough to take me to heaven and back. For appetizers, we ordered the arancia (sp?) - sort of bread-covered rice balls - which were DELICIOUS. Their Caesar salad was perfect, and my friend's gnocchi and my eggplant pasta dish were both mouthwatering. We absolutely loved everything we had, especially the large cannoli at the end. And we got a free t-shirt! We were both extremely happy with both the service and the food and will definitely come back. Special shout out to Todd, whose consideration and wonderful service helped us to have such a fantastic experience.",

    "text": "We were referred here by 2 friends who dine here frequently, friends that we share similar taste buds with! So of course we had to try. When we drove up it seemed to be another great hole in the wall restaurant. Nothing too fancy on the outside...but when we walked in it was like walking into Old Vegas...live band playing great tunes, Old Vegas pictures on the wall, dim lighting, wait staff dressed very nice. We were sat in a corner booth by the entrance. It was a great spot, overlooked everything. If you want a quiet, romantic spot...not the place to come during the busy hours! But we were not there for that. We were there for some great Italian food. Our waiter came over introduced himself, asked if we had been before and then proceeded to tell us about the menu and the specials. We ordered our drinks and were served yummy hot bread and butter.  I ordered the special, gnocchi with filet tips in a gargonzola cream sauce and my man ordered the Fettucine Alla Pappasito Fresh homemade egg noodles tossed with a combination of crumbled and sliced smoked sausage, mixed with sauteed sweet onions in a white wine four cheese sauce. Our food came out fresh and hot and DELICIOUS! The sauces on both dishes were AMAZING... Our 1st experience here was fantastic. Food 110% spot on, service as well and for the price was worth it 5 star experience . Now for last night...we had such a great experience the 1st time we wanted to go back...I don't normally write a review unless I have been at least 2 times or if it was just terrible the 1st. I have to say I am very sad to report that this time we had about a 2 star experience which is why I am giving it a 3 star total.  I called ahead to see how busy they were, it was late and I didn't know what time they stopped serving. The lady on the phone who is so very pleasant said they didn't stop til 3:30am ...it was about 10:30pm  so we were good.  We got there and the band was done, so it was very quiet, perfect time to come if you want that quiet atmosphere. We were seated at a booth. It was not busy inside. There were about 5 tables with people all together. We sat and looked thru the menu. Sat some more, sat even more...about 10 mins, no waiter, no water, no service. Then a waiter walked over, helped the couple sitting at the table next to us, turned around when he was done and apologized for the delay. Not sure why there was a delay since the place was dead. We ordered waters, he said that he would get that and have bread sent over to the table. He brought back our waters, told us about the specials, which sounded amazing, so we ordered one of each. Mine was penne pasta with a cream sauce, cheese and lobster, he suggested a side of marinara to counteract some of the cheese...and my man ordered the fettuccine with this steak a that had spinach and cheese rolled up inside with seasoning and marinated over night and slow roasted to perfection, the sauce was a butter garlic.  The bread finally came out, but went to wrong table, so the waiter reached over, took it off their table and gave it to us. Was it warm? Yes...but didn't taste or feel fresh, not like our 1st visit. Waters were refilled regularly which is big for me...I don't like an empty glass. Our food came out and it looked delicious. Unfortunately, it was not a big hit. Man's dish had very little meat, surrounding a pile of spinach inside, no cheese, he said no flavor and like it had been broiled really quick...tough. not like the waiter described at all. Mine was good. Not great. I mixed it all up looking for the lobster...we paid  $32 for each plate. I had maybe 3 pieces of lobster that were SO small I had to rub off the sauce with my fork to see if it really was lobster....disappointed to say the least. For $32 there should have been some hefty chunks of lobster in there and my man's food should have been as described by the waiter. The marinara sauce was delicious. We did order cesar salad prior and those were fantastic as well. Our service,once we finally had some, was good.  But I am truly disappointed with my $72 bill for what we had. I really wanted to be able to give this place 5 Stars since our 1st experience was so wonderful but am sadly giving it a 3. Had we not been prior I would have only given it a 2. :(",

We went on Monday night with no reservation however they put table for our five together quickly.  The highlights of what I tasted were warm bread, calamari app, half priced bottle of wine, fettuccine alfredo and stuffed pork chops all very good.  I wasn't a fan of arancini rice balls app and wish I had room for cannoli for desert.  Regardless, this is a must try LV Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here for a last minute Valentines Day Dinner celebration.  We agreed to take the available 545p seating, when we arrived, we were asked to wait at the bar until our table was ready which is never a problem for us.  As soon as we took a seat at the bar, a young girl approached me and handed me a rose and small box of chocolate which was a nice, cute little touch.  Before we could even order a drink our table was ready.  We were seated in front of the stage where live music was playing classic lounge tunes.  Our server, Robert came by and asked us if it was our first time visiting.  We told him it was and he responded with, \"this will be your new favorite restaurant\"  He told us about some of the specialties and took our drink orders.  While we were waiting for our appetizer, fresh sourdough bread came to the table served with butter and a shaker of parmesean cheese.  The bread was warm and delicious.  Our calamari came next and the calamari was good but what really made it was the marinara sauce that it came with, we could've eaten the marinara by the spoonful.  I ordered a cup of pasta fagioli which was full of flavor and so comforting :)  Entrees came out soon afterwards, I ordered the frutti de mare pasta with red sauce and my boyfriend ordered the lobster/shrimp ravioli special.  I finished every last bite of my dish.  We saved room for dessert and ordered the cannoli (with complimentary t shirt) and had a vodka martini and baileys coffee while we waited for dessert.  The vodka martini was so good, nice and dirty, I would've ordered another but was starting to get a little tipsy so decided to make martini's at home instead.  What we got out of this dinner, was a great Valentines Day Dinner date, a feeling of old Las Vegas, great ambience, excellent food and service and a new favorite restaurant, I guess that's why their motto is, \"Vegas, the way it used to be!  Leave the gun...take the cannoli\"",

I've seen this restaurant more times than I can count, and never, not once even considered stopping in to check it out. I'm not a fan of Italian food so it never even occurred to me to see what they were offering inside CDA. That was a huge mistake.  I feel like I've been looking for this place for years. And didn't even know it. I don't trust anyone who doesn't dig their old-school decor and energy. And the service is outstanding. Lynn, the music coordinator helped  turn a simple birthday gathering into a real celebration. The band sang a special birthday song for everyone that requested it.  From what I can tell, this is a go-to birthday spot for many people. How do I know? I heard Happy Birthday at least 4 times. But who cares? There was certainly an air of celebration in the place.   The food was solid--the insalata di amore, calamari, and cioppino were all tasty. The cioppino was (rightly) the standout of the night. And the atmosphere is pure retro-Vegas charm. I am such a fan.",

Seating is congested and you need to get accustomed to the general noise level which includes the live music and  chatter of waiters and customers  Surprisingly, I was the only one of our group to order a regular meal off the menu.  I chose the Chicken Alfredo which I found to be a nice size, tasty and fairly priced.  The others in my group elected to try various side dishes for their meals including a tasty meatball and various pasta options.  Overall, most of our group felt the portion sizes were larger then they wanted to eat and were happy with the smaller plate options.  Service was attentive, prices were fair and the noise level was higher then we would prefer. .",

The staff was very friendly, and the guy who performed had an amazing Frank Sinatra kinda voice...my kinda jam.  I got the Osso Buco (veal on a bed of risotto rice---very tasty) paired with an awesome glass of Chocolate Shop red wine--which was a sweeter kind of red wine. Great place if you want a little something nicer than Olive Garden with a twist of Vegas authenticity!",

The gentleman who does the entertainment/singing/piano is quite a character, he has a lovely voice and we enjoyed his music and spirit.  One of the highlights was him pulling his old friend, an actor/performer, on stage for an impromptu performance, very neat.   Our waiter, Tony (of course), truly made our evening; the wine recommendation from Cakebread Cellars was bang on - and because it was Sunday (& Mondays too) all wine bottles were 50% off, wow!   The lobster ravioli special was incredible as was the pomodoro fresco.  The bruschetta was good, but we wouldn't order that one again.  Desserts were excellent, made in house and imported from Italy. The ambiance, entertainment, service, food and wine were fantastic; we thoroughly enjoyed this fun, cozy and romantic evening; for that, we thought the prices were reasonable.  It cost us $24 for a cab from the strip to here, but they do offer a complimentary limousine that we may take advantage of next time - oh yes, there will definitely be a next time. A nice break from the high priced, fake, stuffy places on the strip.",

You can't really go with a group over four people without a reservation. I recommend making a reservation to get a booth, otherwise the tables are fairly small. Dinner was good but not greAt. Perhaps they need to make their pasta a little more fresh from scratch for an extra star from me. Overall the romance was there. The live music sends me back to Sinatra times. Service was great.

We never knew he was there but somehow our water was always filled and our empty plates mysteriously disappeared from the table. Food was delicious. Calamari was lightly breaded and crispy. My eggplant was stuffed with cheese and spinach and still managed to stay firm. Hubby had cannelloni with ground veal that melted in your mouth. A word to the wise, they are closed on Tuesdays and MAKE A RESERVATION! We happened to walk in on a Monday night and there was one open table. ONE! There is a small bar area with a few open  2 person booths. Just goes to show how amazing this place is that a Monday is standing room only.",
