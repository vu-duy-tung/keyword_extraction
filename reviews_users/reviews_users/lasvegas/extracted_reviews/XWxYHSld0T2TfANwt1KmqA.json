Many things you've heard of, but I went adventurous and had the Hand Held breakfast menu - with the short ribs, eggs, muchrooms, bacon and cheese on Cuban Bread.  It was a little dry, so I ordered the Ranchero sauce on the side and that fixed it up nicely.  Ordered a glass of OJ and it comes in a tiny little mason jar...not much if you are thirsty.  Waiter was decent.  I'd try a more routine item next time, but for a 24 hour restaurant, it wasn't bad.  I'd go back.",

The service is impressive for being a \"Cafe\". The menu holds a wide variety of options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or those late night cravings. This place is usually somewhat busy but the bar always has somewhere to sit down and place your order for what seems like quicker service. Your food tends to be ready alot sooner than if u were in the dining room. My #1 suggestion no doubt is the short rib nachos. Unbelievable! Whenever i go i just can't pass up on those nachos. Give it a shot!",

I tried the red smoothie and the tropical, 16 oz each. $11 a piece. Taste was lacking and not very cold. Would've been better off with a Jamba Juice. Seems like a tourist trap. Lobby location, nice look, high prices, subpar everything else. I'm sure if you want to get drunk at the bar, it's great, but there's plenty of other options for that.",

My cousin and I walked from MGM to Bellagio and were really hungry, so we hesitantly walked into Caesar's \"Cafe.\" They only had 3.5 stars, and I saw on yelp that their service was bad and their food overpriced. SO WRONG. My cousin had the chicken fingers w/ fries and got like 4 different sauces for $16. Expensive? Wrong! It was so much food and she took half of it home so in my opinion, it was like an $8 meal. I'm vegan, but my server, despite needing to take an order for a table of 12, patiently explained to me even more vegan options which expanded my options to about 9. At a lot of restaurants I go to, servers typically just offer me 1-2 modifications with an attitude. I ultimately settled on the spaghetti with giant meatballs but got the meatballs replaced with veggies. Our server also made sure that they didn't put Parmesan cheese in my spaghetti and gave me bread and olive oil to replace the usual nonvegan garlic bread that comes with the meal. Service stayed good throughout the whole meal, even though the place was short-staffed as we later found out after having a chat with Suda, the manager. She said that three people called in sick probably because it was Christmas night. Anyway, I had a good experience overall and would give more than five stars if I could!",

I had the chicken barbecue sandwich- a sandwich that features chicken with a guava barbecue sauce, cheese (I think it was Swiss), a fried onion ring, and bacon. All of this delicious middle was put in a sesame brioche bun. The chicken was tender, the bun sweet and fluffy, the bacon not too salty, and the onion ring on point. The only complaint I have is that they didn't put enough cheese on the sandwich, but it didn't make it or break it. All of this came with fries.  Overall, the service was good. The major issue that you will find in most of the bad reviews is that it's pricey. But with a sushi place selling 90 dollar sushi not too far away, I think that the prices are justifiable.",

I got a box menu, which is a choice of two items on a designated menu. I chose the quinoa salad and the Cubano sandwich. The salad was mediocre at best, as it was very bland and lacking in depth and flavor. On the other hand, the cubano was crazy salty (and also made without mustard!) and dry. One bite is all it took to lose the integrity of the skin on the roof of my mouth.   My brother ordered \"The Best Fried Chicken\", which was not quite as great as the name suggests. It was reported to be \"bleh\" and dry.   Needless to say, we are going to venture out for some more food after this. So much hunger still.",

The restaurant is located in the lobby of Caesars Palace. This honestly wouldn't normally be my first choice while In Vegas but I was pleasantly surprised. The bar seating was great for essential Vegas people watching and bartenders provided fast friendly service. The Cuban Sandwich I ordered on the bartenders recommendation was very tasty and definitely hit the spot after a long flight. The bread was the perfect amount of crispy and all the typical Cuban sandwich flavors were present. I would definitely eat here again for a quick bite if my choice of restaurants was limited.",

I am a foodie at heartx food is a passion to be enjoyed not just consumed. And the Clam Chowder at Cafe Americano can only be described as Orgasmic. It gave me goosebumps with every bite. The broth is so flavorful, the fresh herbs added on top with the cripy fried bacon pieces gives it some bite and crunch. The whole baby clams, pieces of red and sweet potatoes gives it a noce rustic feel. Hands down... I will be having this again before i leave Legas. Saul... you are very knowledgeable about your menu and I can not thank you enough for an out of body experience.   Sincerely Tiffany Hall",

The restaurant couldn't cancel the food, but when we told the person dropping the food that they had left, she just took it away, and they didn't take it off our bill until we complained. The food was mediocre and cold. They wouldn't take off the beer for the guy who left ... understandable, but frustrating. It was literally 25 minutes. They said they'd take off the cocktail for the girl who left, since they never brought it. When the bill came, it still had their food and one of their drinks on it.",

It came out well done, not juicy, no flavor just like spam. The tomato on the burger was half white and 1/2 inch thick - it was picked too soon and cut too thick. Why anyone would actually pick this piece of tomato up and proudly put it on a sandwich is beyond my comprehension! Obviously Quality Control is not discussed there. Soggy fries Sent it back  The water was cold and the bus boy was nice.",

She showed us the menu and we decided on the Clam Chowder, we told her we wanted calm chowder, she then asked where we would like to sit and we told her the bar.   Couple mins later bar tender (super nice guy) showed up and asked us if we wanted anything and we told him no, we already had drinks and had placed our order.  10mins later I asked if they had a bread basket for people waiting on food..... the hostess went and got the manager who in a very condescending tone asked if we had food coming...we told her yes we had placed an order for soup   Another 10-15mins pass and she brings us the bread basket and informed us they were still making the soup...  another 10 mins pass and she asks the bartenders if we ordered soup through them, they both responded no. She then comes and tells us that there is no order for our soup and the hostess never put in the order.....  At this point I am pissed, my friend was hungry she had an extraction and could only drink soup... and I State that to the waitress who asked us if everything is okay. She ran back to the kitchen and reappeared with 2mins with the soup and bread...  And while the bartender was awesome he did charge my card for my friends soup and walked up with the receipt...my friend had cash in hand to pay him...  Bunch of errors, bunch of misunderstanding, the manager is super rude and condescending. Just awful experience.   Food was great, but I didn't order the soup and was charged for something I didn't personally place.",

Here's the thing, I am not complaining about the price - I realize it's expensive to eat and drink on the Strip. However, give me some value for my money - the margs were made from a mix with cheap tequila. If I am going to spend $15 for a cocktail, that's fine.  But: Make. Me. A. Cocktail.  By that I mean, put some tequila, triple sec and lime juice in a shaker and go to town on it. I can get the shitty marg mix anywhere.   Then there was the guac - it was so cold it was almost frozen, like it had been in the fridge since someone made it several hours earlier. Again, if I am going to spend $15 for an appetizer: Make. Me. A. Frigging. Appetizer.  Don't just go grab something out of the fridge that the crew on the last shift made.   Our server was a super nice guy, too bad the food and drink didn't meet up to the effort he put into giving us a good experience. I couldn't stiff him on the tip, so I added 20% and walked out of there $60 lighter and unsatisfied.  To be clear - I am not complaining about the price, it's the value that is lacking.  There are a lot of places on the Strip that I would go to before I went back to this place.",

    "text": "Stopped in Saturday night for a snack with some friends before we hit the casino and encountered the worst service ever. I do have to say that the cocktail I had and the Hangover Burger were delicious. There were several bartenders and the male bartender made a great drink. The \"service\" we received from the female brunette bartender however ruined all of our experiences. She was completely rude from the moment she threw menus at us to when we received our check mid meal. A girlfriend and I ordered our drinks and a burger to share. This bartender brings our checks and we pay. While we are eating she demands we settle up on the beer we ordered. Well we didn't order a beer. Another friend directly next to us did. When we tell her \"the beer belongs to him\" She exclaims \"I don't care, your together so you're responsible.\" She didn't even give the person who ordered it, the opportunity to pay. The way she talked to us stayed with our entire group and here it is 4 days later and I still feel upset about it.",

I didn't order food bc of the hastiness of my situation and the price (omg everything is so expensive), but I did have the rest of my friends pancakes which I must say were amazing!  The service was also incredible even though I was just having water.  The waitress was very attentive.  The atmosphere, for a side hotel restaurant that's open 24 hours was very inviting and upscale in nature.  Idk about the other hours of the day but at 2:30am, this place was on point.",

Ordered the American breakfast plate (I think that's what it was called), a mimosa and hubby ordered the huevos rancheros with a green smoothie. Overall, the food is really good. Fresh ingredients for sure. My hubby mentioned the huevos rancheros was one of the best he's ever had, so that definitely says something. My plate was traditional and boring, but it was also very good.   Walked out spending $80. Expensive for sure. We realize that we could've just went back to our hotel and had the brunch/breakfast buffet for $35.   With everything else that the strip has to offer, I probably won't be back any time soon.",

However, the food does taste fresh and hits the spot. Breakfast wrap had too much arugula, not Enough eggs. The hash browns were cooked well. The portions are at least very large- great for sharing! Wouldn't come back for breakfast, but I would recommend lunch, casual dinner or post drinking grub. The burger and fries were excellent and the Mac n cheese very delicious. If the prices were less I would be more inclined to eat here. These prices are higher than any other casino diner I've been to in vegas. Don't come out of your way to eat here, but it's convenient if staying at Caesars.",

Had the Brooklyn sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich was huge and I felt I was eating 4 or 5 Breakfast Jacks. The hash browns were not crispy. If you like them crispy, let the waiter know. My waiter was a little creepy. Just caught this weird vibe. He kept hovering and asking me if everything was ok and stuff. Used to people checking on me once after delivering food but not more than that. Perhaps because there were only 3 tables occupied he didn't know what else to do.  I'm not sure I would eat there again. Maybe I'll go walk to a nearby hotel to find something a little cheaper. Food was good but after tip, $30 for a breakfast sandwich was a little much.",

I could've done without the horribly over-fried onion ring on top, but it was a a really good sandwich overall. The fries weren't bad either.   The staff here does the bare minimum.

My friends and I went into this establishment at 3 am we had just came in from out of town and were excited to have our first drink. We sat down and were reading the menu that was on the bartop. We were deciding on which drinks to order. I noticed the bartender busy pouring Hennessy, he then walked over to the guests next to us and he didn't make eye contact. I tried making eye contact with him he ignored my friends and I. It was about 3:15 so I just explained to my friends that he was busy and he would get be right with us. He didn't acknowledge us or make any time of effort to talk to us at any point of our visit. Then two gentlemen walk to the bartop and sat right next to us and he immediately served him that's when we got upset. We left at 3:33 am that's how long we waited for service. I recorded him so management can take action on his discriminative behavior. He definitely needs to be trained on hospitality and how racism and discrimination isn't part of the service industry. His lack of hospitality was vividly demonstrated last night, I'm sure this wasn't the first time he has done this. I work in the service industry and I know exactly what he was doing. He was picking and choosing who he was wanted to serve. I wouldn't want for anyone else to experience such discrimination. I would hope management will take my post seriously and have a conversation with him. **It won't let me post the video however if management will like to view it you may contact me.",

Hash-browns covered the other half of the plate, cooked perfectly. Big guys, this will fill you up.   Mango smoothie was tasty and not too sweet. Probably too filling for me along with a huge omelet. I managed to finish the toast, omelet, and smoothie, just had no more room for the hash browns. With no refrigerator in the room, I had to leave them. There really was enough for two people.  People with smaller appetites should ask if they can split the omelet. If you can, this suddenly becomes the best and most affordable breakfast outside of House of Blues for Defcon people, and much closer to the conference. Not sure if they will let you carry out, but that would be amazing.",

I had ordered a Cosmopolitan, which was offered as $13.00 on the drink menu. The bill had the charge of $13.00 plus a $3.00 up charge. When I asked our bartender about the additional $3.00, she said the prices had changed and their menu had not been updated yet. I reminded her that I ordered a $13.00 Cosmo as advertised on the menu, and that is what I expected to pay. She took it up with the bar manager, and adjusted the bill accordingly. In the end, I was charged fairly, but this \"bait and switch\" left a bad taste in my mouth. There are too many other reputable bars on the strip that don't use these shady sales tactics.",

And they have a membership where you can get first seating which sucks if you just want breakfast in your hotel. The food was pretty high but it's all based on your preference. It's ok to try but I wouldn't go there again for breakfast specifically while in Vegas. Try some other places and step out of your hotel! They put sweet potatoes in your fried which wasn't bad but I wish they would have mentioned that on the menu. First time for everything though. They do stay open all day which is nice when coming from a night out.",

We ordered 2 appetizers, some meatballs and a chicken quesadilla, with 1 margarita and 1 other cocktail. The meatballs were not hot, almost cold, and the chicken quesadilla was very bland. The margarita was also awful, and tasted like a bad sugary limeade without alcohol. After a completely mediocre meal, we were slapped with a 70 dollar bill for 2 appetizers and 2 drinks! Needless to say, I was shocked at the prices for such terrible food and drinks. I will absolutely never go back. I ate the next day at The Wynn and had a delicious meal for only 56.00. Go elsewhere if you want good food.",

So much so that I stopped eating & picked from H's plate. The OJ was very fresh, cold & delicious & the coffee some of the best I've had in Vegas.   The staff was phenomenal!

    "text": "I'm only giving Cafe Americano a 1 Star because that's the lowest rating Yelp allows me. The seating process was not complicated, but it was inefficient. We went New Year's night. It was busy, but the lines were only 3-4 families deep and there were plenty of open tables. We got on a seating list and told it would be 30 minutes.  An hour later, with no contact from the hostess, we asked what the issue was. She told us that \"something broke\" in the kitchen and they were no longer going to seat us.  This \"midnight snack\" would have cost us at least $200 with a party of six and pancakes costing $20! Fresh fruit would have been $25. I don't mind the high prices, but with $$$ should come courtesy, consideration, and customer service.   There were no apologies....\"we can no longer seat you, something broke in the kitchen.\" Not acceptable... not after an hour of waiting.",

It's basically a 24-hour tourist trap. And, it's independently owned so you won't get any Total Rewards credits for eating here. The bill was about $75 (including tip) for one beer and two hamburgers. The hamburgers did come with french fries that were OK. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. I only ate half of it. And, seriously when I eat there are maybe two crumbs left on a plate. The service wasn't great either. Overall, save your money and try a different restaurant. There are plenty to choose from in Vegas!",

I Was simply looking for a quick burger or fries, and on Ryan the bartender's recommendation, I tried the patty melt.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Like--melt in your mouth insanely good and I'm irritated with myself that I didn't go back and have it again for breakfast today before leaving Vegas!  Great open bar--plenty of people watching, and super attentive bartending staff.    It's NOT CHEAP and you can expect to pay $20-$25 for a burgers and fries --but it's convenient and delicious ..and considering the location .....when in Rome!    Delish!!",

The menu is reasonably concise and makes selection easy. I had traditional Eggs Benedict, which was served with the potato hash. Hash was perfectly crispy and very well seasoned (this is not always the case -I'm sure you can relate to that). The eggs were just a touch overlooked, and would wish for Hollandaise sauce pour to be a bit more generous, but overall it was quite tasty dish (I'm somewhat nit picking here).  What I have a problem with is prices - I know it is Las Vegas, but $22 for eggs Benedict is steep (I guess I can live with $5 coffee as it comes with refills). Interestingly enough, pasta dish on dinner menu costs $25 - hard to figure out pricing strategy.  Well, during the late night, this might be your only option anyway...",

Enter Cafe Americano, which was right outside the door and advertised being a 24-hr place. We decided to grab a seat on the patio, so we could share a hookah while we hung out. The price was pretty steep (like $40 if I remember right... about 3x a normal place, but hey, it's Vegas, so I get it), and we went for the apple+mint combo, which to be fair, was great. I ordered a glass of prosecco that was absolutely flat when I got it.. The fish and chips I had were delicious, but the breading on the fish was REALLY heavy. I'm not sure I'd order it again because it was a bit much for me.   About an hour into our evening, they began shutting the patio down. The hookah (understandably) can't be moved inside, so we had to finish up and get on our way. All in all, it's a fine place to stop if there's not much else open. Our check was split 3 ways and for the items I've described here, I paid about $70. It was the most expensive meal I had in Vegas and probably one of the least impressive. To be fair, though, it included hookah, which was kind of a fun experience.",

I really recommend not coming here because the food isn't really that good and the price is definitely not worth the average quality u get. I only rated it 2 stars just for the food service, other than that, this place is not worth the money. $25 for a piece of shit burger!",

I mainly eat chicken and thought a burger would be a nice treat. $24 for fries and an overcooked, dry burger on a too thick bun was a poor choice.   My friend ordered  a BLT, $25. It was served on 2 slabs of brioche bread, extra lettuce, a minimal amount of tomato and bacon. His side salad was a few bites of various greens.   $5.50 for his after meal coffee.  Not worth $59 plus tip. We liked the music but it was so loud we could hardly  hear each other or the severs. They had to talk louder and we did too when placing our order.   As locals I doubt we will eat there again or take visiting family or friends either.",

There was a large group of us there for lunch, but the amount of time it took for burgers, Cuban, and BLT sandwiches was on the border of too long.  We did have a good server who was working hard to get orders in and keep drinks filled.  There was nothing that was horrible about the location, food or service, but nothing that really stood out to me so that is where the 3 stars came it.  It was convenient as well as not too busy for lunch so we were able to talk and catch up.",

But I also have to mention and applaud the excellent service by the staff.  We had the pleasure of having Kristina Hernandez as our server.  She was excellent. Kristina was extremely helpful with menu options which was important since my wife is on a gluten free diet. In addition, she was extremely personable.  We were so impressed and pleased with Kristina that we requested that we be seated in her section for the rest of our trip.  Kristina and the rest of the staff will make your meal an enjoyable dining experience.  Also want to give kudos to Jessica who served us dinner at Terrazzo, the outside cafe.

I returned it to get my original order and waited another 20 min! We were also talked out of our food order!!! He told us if we don't like it, he gets to eat! It's a win-win situation. We said \"we'll try the Quesadilla\", he said \"the Nachos?\"  If you like being up-sold by a car salesman and slow service then this is your place! As more people came in, the slower the service became. We had to call the water boy over to get service and the check. We became irritated with the Sauls scheme. Our $90 ticket for 4 drinks and Nachos could've gone a lot further for better service and authentic food elsewhere.",

English muffin perfectly toasted, eggs perfectly poached, and hollandaise sauce was great. However, the crab cakes could've used a little more crab and a little less bread so I was a little underwhelmed having previously lived in Maryland where there's a very high standard for crab cakes. The meal came with breakfast potatoes, which were good. Overall, this is a great place to come for breakfast.",

This is the only cafe really close to the registration and Augustus and Octavia towers so unless you want to hike a bit, you're stuck here for convenience but be prepared to wait forever for a table even though there are tons of tables that are available.  I never understand it.  The two girls at the front are on a power trip because they can seat people how they want and they give attitude unless they like you.  Maybe they expect bribe money for a quicker table.  The atmosphere is nice and the servers are ok.  It is overpriced but that is expected inside the hotel.   For the Price you expect exemplary service and courtesy and professionalism which you will not get here, not even close.  Be prepare to wait again after you are seated like 15 more minutes before you get your food.  Save yourself time and money and go anywhere else for food, and if you don't like hiking for breakfast, then you have to stay at another hotel too.

The first breakfast place that excited me since I was a kid eating at diners on Long Island, so much so that I had to submit this review. If I was still a party animal, I could also see eating there at 4 am after clubbing - but those days are sadly long behind me...  Food awesome. The American breakfast - with the typical eggs (three), meat choices (ham steak thick and succulent), potatoes (incredible crispy thick hash browns or home fries), half dozen toast options, etc was perfect. The huevos rancheros (again three eggs any style and delicious chorizos) with lots of extras including avocado were better that I can find in Dallas where I now live. The plates of French toast, fruit, etc that went by my table looked fresh, authentic and amazing. Coffee just as tasty as Starbucks.   Ambience bright, open and delightful. Big TVs over bar in case u want to watch games while chowing down (NFL ticket allowed me to watch four games over breakfast on Sunday morning).  Tip, if not watching ball games, ask for table towards rear by windows, unless hangover won't allow u to be near sun!  Also nice outdoor seating.   Service excellent, too.   In closing, I can't imagine eating at a breakfast or brunch buffet for two or three times the cost over Cafe Americano if staying at Caesars.",

The breakfast burrito was really good, along with the breakfast plate. The reason why I rated 3-stars is because of the quality of attention given to food served. The fruit platter looked amazing from the table next to us, but ours didn't look as fresh and it wasn't. The watermelon looked as if it had been frozen and melon looked a little dried. In addition, the grapes were moldy! When we pointed this out, we were discounted merely $5. For those of you that don't know, one moldy grape usually means the other grapes alongside it aren't good either. If the grapes were next to other fruit, the possibility of the other fruit being bad are higher and restaurants are advised to get rid of them. If you find a moldy slice of bread, you don't throw that ONE out and try to eat the others. You throw the whole bag away. Cute cafe, good food for the most part, but quality definitely matters.",

Service was fairly good but the prices and nickel and dime crap was outrageous.  $70 breakfast...one omelette, one eggs Benedict, an OJ, and a coffee.  Are they out of their minds?!?!  There was nothing special about it, as for the OJ, it was 1 cup exactly....how do I know???? They brought it to me in a mason jar that had the measurements on the side!  Coffee wasn't impressive, nothing about this place screamed....hell ya fuck ya....it was more like....congrats, you have survived, and if I had known that, I would have hopped a cabby outta there and gone someplace worth my money...and probably would have been cheaper with a taxi ride.

The greens were stale and the chicken was hard as a thief's head.  The second entres was their breakfast item steak and eggs.  The steak was described as ribeye, but its name was the only relationship with it and a ribeye steak as we have come to enjoy.  It was tough and contained gristle.  The eggs were ordered over medium and were served nearly uncooked.  Bottom line we cannot recommend this restaurant and are surprised it survives as a companion to Caesars hospitality. PS the price was $65.00 before tax.",

The spaghetti and meatball dinner was quite expensive at $26.00 (no soup, salad or bread included) but that's Caesars and I don't mind paying if the food and service is excellent which it was. We also ate breakfast here; the All American Breakfast ($22.00!) included eggs, potatoes, toast and choice of bacon, sausage or ham. It was good and fresh. This restaurant is very pleasant and has an upscale feel to it.",

Caesars Palace has very few options for breakfast. I'm not sure why one of the other umpteen restaurants at Caesars doesn't host breakfast. We enjoyed Cafe Americano. Portions were much too large for us and while some might find that a plus, but it feels wasteful to us. Our waiter was attentive. The food delicious. My bf enjoyed the pancakes and I had the classic eggs Benedict. Would've been nice to have a piece of fruit on the plate. Coffee was good.",

Came across Cafe Americano the other night and decided to stop for some dinner and drinks.  I ate the giant meatball and my friends had a Cuban sandwich and a pizza - food was so tasty and although a little high in price we expected it for Caesars Palace but to be honest I feel the price was worth it.  Drinks were tasty especially the espresso martini!  The best thing about this place is the service - our server was Danielle and she was excellent - such a nice lady and incredibly attentive to us.  We were also checked on by the manager (can't remember his name but he was British) - he stopped and chatted to make sure everything was ok a couple of times.  Will definitely recommend this place to my friends!",

Nope!  We were there at about 11:30 and they said they couldn't do Eggs Benedict anymore, they stopped serving that at 11. OK. I ordered some pasta with sausage. The other 3 people in my group ordered breakfast from the limited \"after 11\" menu.   They have a free margarita with a Yelp check in, which my friend got. It was served in a soda cup, and he said it was the weakest margarita he had ever had. Why was it not in an actual Margarita glass with a salt rim and all that jazz? It looked like a cup of lemonade.   Food came out, my pasta was dry and lacking flavor. It had sausage, fennel, red bell peppers, cheese, and olive oil. More oil, more cheese, and more seasoning on the veg would have made this good, but it wasn't. Nice effort, but no, for $28.   Husband got the Brooklyn Breakfast Sandwich with cheese, eggs, and ham. It was put together very poorly and did not taste like a $23 sandwich.   My friend had a basic breakfast of bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast, very underwhelming at a high price point. My brother got the pancakes, which were undercooked and not good.   The bill was $130 for 4 crappy meals. Save your money and go somewhere better!",

What I loved the most about this place was that I was able to make a few changes to my order. One day I just wanted 1 fried egg (wasn't too hungry) and they were able to make it for me. The service was great, all the servers we had were awesome and always checking on us that we were fine. It was a big group of us all the time and waiting for our food was never an issue.

The first visit was great with an absolutely best breakfast that I have had in a very long time.    So, I decided to return and dine there again.  Wow!  Was I so intoxicated that I didn't notice how filthy the tables were on the first visit?  Or that the utensils had food debris from a poorly washed effort?  The placemats had crumbs and other sticky stuff still on it, which I hadn't realized until I rubbed my hands across them.  I wanted to leave right there and then but I had already ordered my food and drinks.  The glass of water didn't come for about ten minutes after placing the request.  The coffee took even longer and should I mention that refills on the coffee are not guaranteed?  At least not during my visit and when I did get a refill, the coffee was warm at best.  The breakfast wasn't as good as before, but that may have been because I had such poor table service. We didn't finish our breakfast and left, deciding to eat an early lunch elsewhere.  I wanted to give them 2-stars because the first visit (while in my drunken stupor) was good.  I wouldn't recommend dining here since they are over priced and not a good reflection for Caesar's brand name.  I know Cafe Americano isn't a Caesars establishment but they are inside Caesars and should have high standards and quality service.  Next time, I'll walk across the street and dine at Denny's, I heard they are open 24/7 and have endless hot coffee.",

Me and hubs ordered an all American breakfast which is 3 scrambled eggs, 3 strips of bacon, 4 slices of tomato and toast for $22 + tip + tax. Insane. It wasn't organic or free range eggs. Bacon was standard and over cooked to the point they were like crackers. Toast was not buttered. No cottage cheese as a substitute for hash browns. Thin measly slices of tomato were overripe. With a cup of a coffee, our meal was $35 bucks. Do yourself a favor and go off strip or even across the strip for a more reasonably priced breakfast. For this price next time I'm going to order room service and eat breakfast in bed! The only redeeming thing about the place is the ambiance is nice and the staff are really great.

The buttermilk pancakes could easily serve 4 people- Each pancake was large & fluffy & easily bigger than my face. They were served with powdered sugar, whipped butter, & maple syrup. My 4yo son was in pancake heaven.  We also ordered the loaded hash skillet with home fries. The apple wood smoked bacon, pork belly, peppers, onions, sweet potatoes, topped off with a sunny side up egg was really delicious.  Our table of 3 shared these 2 orders and we couldn't finish all of it.",

Soooo Yummy! The service was a little slow but they made up for the delay with a lovely birthday cheesecake! I would definitely go back when in Vegas.",

I remember seeing this place on my way to the pool prior day so I decided to give it a try. We waited about 10 minutes to get seated, not bad at all. As soon as we sat down, we were welcome by our waiter. He was very nice and he provided excellent customer service. It's too bad I don't remember his name but I hope all employees are just like him. I ordered steak and eggs and orange juice. I loved both. The orange juice, small serving though, was delicious. Natural and hand squeezed orange juice. For me that makes a huge difference. The steak was served in slices but daaaaamn it was a lot. Cooked to perfection. I enjoyed it. Every penny was well spent. The atmosphere was also nice. It makes you feel comfortable. No needed to dress up. Very casual environment. Highly recommend it!",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite breakfast place at Caesar's Palace because their bacon was thick and crispy and the rest of the All American Breakfast plate was delicious.  Ever since we discovered this place last year, we've been going here every time we go to Vegas and always enjoyed the delicious All American Breakfast. On this most recent trip, we stopped by my favorite place to eat the All American Breakfast only to be severely disappointed!  My hash browns came out cold, as if it had been sitting there for a while. And if that wasn't bad enough, the bacon was greasy and dark looking, as if they re-fried yesterday's bacon. The usually crispy bacon was greasy and soggy and tough at the same time. The fatty parts were soft and greasy, and the meaty part was super dark red - it reminded me of beef jerky (dry and tough texture). I am so disappointed. Just because we came on a weekday morning and they may have been a little slower than usual doesn't mean they should serve old bacon!!!!  The eggs were the only thing that came out okay (hot and done right).  If any of the staff had to eat the same food we were served today, I do not think they would have enjoyed it and they probably would not have been able to serve the food with a clear conscience.  I didn't want to risk sending it back because we all know what happens when you do. So disappointing and upset that we had to pay ~$25 for the All American Breakfast that was not worth the money.  I can't justify paying that much for a basic breakfast if they're going to serve me food that is old, subpar, and cold.",

That said, my Brooklyn Breakfast Sandwich was perhaps the most delicious egg/bacon/cheese sandwich I've ever eaten. The eggy bun was very delicious, tasty and very fresh.  I was at the bar and service was great. The coffee was good and strong, but a bit lukewarm. The only food related blip in my experience.   The sandwich was huge so I was able to take half away for a late morning snack. However it plus a cup of coffee, tax and tip got me to $36.   The buffet was $38 and no doubt had fruit and other nice breakfast options. Probably a better split of both decadent and healthy food.  Glad I tried it, but may go buffet next time I eat breakfast inside the hotel.",

Maybe make them smaller portions with a smaller price tag.  If you go, plan on sharing.  Only one person in our group cleaned their plate.  The food was just not that good.

    "text": "Don't use your debit or credit card here. Pay with cash. Most likely someone there is using a credit card or debit card reader to save or steal account numbers. I've gone there twice on two seperate occasions both several months apart. Both times the only time I ever used my debit or credit card was at this place only to order drinks as usually everything else including dinner and hotel were being charged to a master account for the company I work for. Both times I've come back home to San Diego only to about a week or so later get a call from my bank that my debit or credit card was being used in Las Vegas at Chucky Cheese and some Waffle House. Oh let's not forget Frys Hardware for $400. Then there was also the gas station. The bank asked me to recall where I've used my cards on these seperate instances and it's only ever been at Cafe Americano so I put two and two together. Highly unlikely that it's mere coincidence that both times I've gone to Vegas my info gets stolen out of thin air. You've been warned! Cafe Americano please look into your POS systems. Something is going on and I can only imagine how many people have repeated fraud on their bank for coming here. I'm only giving one star here because there was a very attentive waiter on the patio bar so service was good but besides that I'll never not pay with cash here",

When ordering he asked me what kind of toast I'd like which led me to believe my meal came with toast. Wrong we were charged $8 for the toast I barely nibbled on. So watch out for sly upcharges... I asked for a cup of hot water to drink, at first the cup seemed clean until I noticed the hot water loosening the dirt off the cup which was now floating around my cup. So of course I requested a new one, but had to ask the manager because our server was no where to be found. The manager himself brought me an even dirtier one this time the inside was stained brown and streaky. Gross! Kudos to him for not looking at the cup before he brought it to me. After my boyfriend brought it to his attention he offered us the dirty cup discount which covered the toast I didn't really want to begin with. Thankfully the food was decent.",

We sent one meal back completely, I ended up sharing my meal and the other meal was barely touched because it was basically inedible.

Our order was responded with a sarcastic \"Great, just how I would like to end my night, by making hot chocolate.\" The passive aggressiveness continued with a unnecessary attitude towards us and ended with a \"Come back and visit when you are ready to have some cocktails.\" It was just completely rude and uncalled for. So I guess don't go if you plan to order anything that isn't alcohol.",

Lettuce on hamberger was not cut for hamburger. Just one large leaf foldwd in half.  The manager ran past us without stopping in the middle of the meal and asked us how the food tasted. He did not wait for our answer.   Bottom line, food tastes good, price was at least double what should be paid, wait staff was attendant, manager doesnt care what you think.",

Chef Matthew has developed a great menu for each. Try the Huevos Rancheros, or items from the Skinny Menu, or his Home Fries with sweet potato pieces. The salmon fillet with citrus spinach was excellent.   The Cafe is considered casual dining, the ambience was relaxed but the wait staff was friendly and attentive;  so though the prices are Vegas Strip (you are at Caesars), it was great value - excellent menu, attentive service.  We loved the location just across the main lobby from the casino hustle.",

The place was pretty empty around 7p and the prices seemed a tad high for a \"cafe\" but we didn't have much of a choice.   We got 2 pasta dishes, the prosciutto pizza and the pork belly nachos for 4 people.  The pizza flavors were SO good - I only wish there was more prosciutto.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the pork belly nachos....OMG I wish I had saved much much more room for those...they were SO good.   The drinks were also very good, although I think a bit light on the alcohol...   Overall, a solid choice for dinner - the ambiance is really nice despite the fact that it's called a cafe, the food portions were solid but not overwhelming and the food itself was great.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located on the opposite side of the \"check in\" desk for the hotel. I've only had 2 plates here being the \"All American Breakfast\" and the \"Steak & Eggs.\" The service here is pretty good on timing. They won't have you feeling left unattended after they've taken your order and served your meal. I felt the staff was professional and did their part. They don't play that \"I didn't see/hear you\" typa stuff like at other restaurants. Both the plates I ordered were made very well as well as for my family members. If you need condiments or anything extra just ask. For both my visits it seems they don't want to waste condiments so they'll give it upon request like sauces, ketchup, jams, etc. It's also nice that they have lines for people of status in Total Rewards because our first time eating there, there was a fat line but since my pops is diamond status, we got seated within 5 min which is really cool if you play with Total Rewards. The only thing I think was a little overboard was the price. I know we're in Vegas and all and the atmosphere is cool, but a traditional Steak & Eggs plate usually goes for $17-$22 at most place. Over here it was $45. Despite that it was actually cooked well, I still felt it was a bit too much that I didn't want it the first time around but on my 2nd visit I said I'll try it and wasn't disappointed. I would recommend this place if you're staying at the hotel and don't wanna lose more $$ and time by having to try and leave your hotel to go somewhere else. They also have tvs and played Sunday football which is also a plus.",

The portions here don't disappoint. They are huge. My dish was full of spinach, avocado and and a variety of veggies. My only issue with my eggs was that they were cooked with too much oil.

The sausage was a bit salty but the beans were surprisingly good! Very flavorful. I'm not even a bean person!  Just those 2 items alone ran me about $50. Pretty steep especially for breakfast.

Cafe Americano did ok with the entrees.  Actually, the sea bass my wife ordered was delicious and I wished that I had selected that instead of the \"Best Fried Chicken\" entree.  Where this Cafe Americano fell flat on its face was with the $15 Caesars Salad I ordered.  I mean, \"Come on Cafe Americano!!!\", I had better side salads in my junior high school cafeteria!  It was absolutely ridiculous and my wife and I have not stopped talking about it since.  For $15 I got an 8 inch cereal bowl filled with chopped Romaine, two little plastic containers of Caesar's dressing made off site by some company, a few croutons and a slice of fried parmesan cheese.  What kitchen in their right mind, at Caesar's Palace no less, could think that kind of salad is a worthy menu item?  And then ask $15 for it?  It was outrageously bad for any restaurant to serve and if they did serve a salad like this, it would be worth, at best, $3-4.  This should have been an embarrassment for this Cafe.  I can safely recommend eating the Sea Bass entree there, but that would be it for me.  There are better places to eat nearby, including the Cafe Hollywood at Planet Hollywood.  I will not ever take a chance on Cafe Americano again unless someone from that Cafe contacts me to explain to my satisfaction what happened that night and makes amends.",

It is in Caesars Palace, so everything is expensive so maybe I shouldn't give them one less star over it but I feel like I have to. We had a burger and fries that we picked up to go one night and then we picked up some a la cart breakfast menu items the morning we were leaving.  The food was surprisingly good both times.  Granted, you are paying a lot for it so you would expect it to be good but it was still better than I had expected.  They were also very fast and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Had a 3.5 star breakfast at Cafe Americano, which would have been a 4 star breakfast had I ordered the hash.  We arrived around 8:30 on a Friday morning and the place was hopping.  We had a 5 minute wait or so, but it was not bad.  Our server, Brian, was fantastic.  Even with how crowded they were we got refills, condiments, and our check very quickly.  We got some drinks to start, I had a mojito.  It was strong and minty, but at $15 it was overpriced, even for a coffee shop in Vegas.  Not very large, but that didn't stop me from ordering another one.  To eat, I went with the breakfast burrito and a side of home fries well done.  Our food arrived after 15 minutes or so and it was hot and fresh, clearly just prepared.  The burrito has chorizo, pork belly, white cheddar, pico, and eggs.  It has another salsa on top along with some crema and avocado.  It is very large and easily shareable.  My biggest complaint is the ingredients were not mixed well.  I only had everything in a single bite for about a third of the burrito.  Those bites were great, but the distribution was off.  Also there was not much meat.  The home fries were fine, nothing to write home about though.  They needed seasoning.  My mother had the hash, which was fantastic.  I would absolutely order this again, and it is also a ton of food.  It was the superior dish by far.  Be advised that some of the breakfast stuff is not available after breakfast.  This was annoying when I tried to order a smoothie after 11 am.  It's Vegas, everything should be available whenever...  As a bonus, check in on Yelp gets you a free margarita as of October of 2018.  Overall, I have had worse 24 hour coffee shops in Vegas, and I have had better.  Cafe Americano gets the job done, and the service really is good.  I would eat here on a future trip to Caesars, but I would not make a special trip to eat here.",

I seriously don't know how I missed it, but on my most recent trip, there it was right next to the hotel check in.  Decided to have a quick lunch with some co-workers in between seminars, and let me tell you how happy we all were!  First of all, there were lots of fun martinis to choose from.  I got a lychee one and it was pretty tasty!  For food, I chose the tortellini with cream sauce, peas, tomatoes and bacon.  It was wonderfully colorful and sooo good!  I couldn't have asked for a better, more satisfying lunch.  One great thing about this place is it's open 24 hours a day.  A definite go-to place when you're staying at Caesar's and get the munchies at 2am.  Next trip to Vegas, I'm definitely coming back here.",

The manager Gerardo was amazing; he is quick, competent, very aware of his restaurant, everything that is going on, and has done an incredible job with this cafe. He is also accommodating and extremely personable.   We arrived during the madness of the business conventions lunch rush and yet were warmly greeted by the hostess (who was handling the rush in a very calm, cool, and collected fashion) We were then seated at a spot just inside where we were promptly greeted by our waiter Gustavo. Let me just say Gustavo is the man! He is very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, has a great sense of humor, and made sure we ordered exactly what would be pleasing to our palates . We ended up ordering the chopped salad, cuban sandwich with fries, and the BLT sandwich with fries as well as diet Pepsi's. Our drinks came out right away and were never even halfway empty before they were filled up again. The food came out quickly and was absolutely beautiful! It was hot (just as it should be), plated in an appetizing manner, offered generous portions, and cooked to perfection  We were starving to we dove right in and each thing was delicious; the fries were crispy melt in your mouth fried sinfulness , the BLT was on toasted sourdough bread and stuffed with goodies that included lots of bacon and avocado which added just the right amount of creaminess. The cuban was huge, and had an abundance of shaved pork layered between a flat bread with yummy sauces to accompany it (Gustavo highly recommend this one and he was right!). The chopped salad was good and once again a very large portion (which is nice for the prices in Vegas) but nothing out of the ordinary. It's clear that since the last time we dined here the food has become high quality both in appearance (we eat with our eyes first), and in taste. We are looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu...they have lots of options for everyone (including the picky eaters); they offer salads, sandwiches, fish, pastas, brunch and obviously a huge bar menu. It isn't cheap, but the quality of food and the amount that you get is well worth it.   The atmosphere is hip and happening; it is fun to see the hustle and bustle of Vegas all around you. Inside is nice, but the patio appears to be even more so (if you can score a patio spot on a nice day I say go for it ). Every single person who waited on us in some fashion were friendly, competent, and actually seemed to enjoy working there (even though they were all so busy). The right hand all appeared to know what the left hand was doing which is clearly a sign of a well managed restaurant.   My family and I look forward to returning to the cafe again soon, we had a fantastic experience and all recommend you make your way there for a great meal (24 hours a day btw)!!!",

We walked over to Cafe Americano and got the last table for four with absolutely no wait! Lots of interesting options for a brunch. My wife and I decided to share the bacon bacon waffle ($24). The waffle itself had bacon and jalapenos baked into it. In between the two waffles were eggs, more bacon, melted cheese, and bacon jam. Absolutely delicious. They split it for us in the kitchen which was very nice. Even sharing this menu item was more than we could finish. $24 for a brunch item is a little pricey. But when you consider that it's the Strip, it's not unreasonable. Plus we were able to split it, so $12 ahead is not so bad. There are about five TVs over the bar, so it's a good place to watch sports while you have your breakfast. Unfortunately, I would never come back here to eat unless I was staying at Caesars because of the $18 surcharge for parking. Clearly the powers that be at Caesars have no interest in having locals come to eat at the restaurants. Too bad",

    "text": "I was recently in Vegas for a conference and found myself staying at Caesars Palace (where the conference was!).  For this day at the conference, we were on our own for lunch; and a few of us decided to stay at the hotel and hit up one of the many restaurants.  We landed on Cafe Americano.  So, this place is your run of the mill hotel quick service sit down.  You want something quick, go here; have more time, go somewhere else.  We had a group of four and were quickly seated (it was lunch time, around 12:30pm).  The lunch menu was fairly extensive and I ended up getting the Cuban sandwich; hey, I'm a sucker for those, okay?  The others got salad, BLT and pasta; like I said, a run of the mill hotel restaurant.  Now, what you get is average food at Vegas hotel pricing (my Cuban was $25, yes, twenty-five US dollars).  Did it taste good, meh, it was okay.  It had the basics like a bunch, cooked meat, pickles (needed more) and mustard.  The fries were good, but how can you mess that up?  If you are about to faint because you haven't eaten, then eat here; if not, I suggest eating somewhere else in the hotel (if you don't want to travel somewhere else).",

The steak was alright, lacking good beef flavour, but it's great if you have a big appetite.  My corn hash was literally corn on hash browns with hard poached eggs and guacamole with even more cornn $25 for a lot.of.corn that sells at $0.50 an ear.  Wouldnt have this again...

Its in such a convenient location right in the lobby of ceasars palace and such a great place to get a place to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late night that is still more on the upscale side of casual. My all time favorite dish from this restaurant is their Free Range roasted chicken (picture provided). I could eat that entree multiple times in a week its so delicious. The chicken is cooked so perfectly that i can honestly say ive never had chicken cooked that well in my life and it is consistantly cooked the exact same way. It comes with this sauce to dip or pour over the chicken that takes this dish to an entirely new level, then it comes with a side of Roasted Asparagus and Green Beans that are perfect.",

It's most redeeming factors are that it's open 24 hours, and has a limited number of Vegan menu items.    I have been here on several occasions, and have always found the servers on the less enthusiastic end of the scale. My most recent visit was the worst ever.    When I arrived I told the hostess I just wanted to order something quick to go and take up to my hotel room.  She instructed me to go to the bar and order from one of the bartenders.  As I approached the first bartender, he stated \"I'm off the clock, go see him\" as he pointed to the opposite end of the bar.  I walked down to that employee, and he said, \"please go see the other bartenders, I'm very backed up helping the servers.\"   I went to a third bartender back on the opposite end of the bar, and he directed me back to the first, that was off the clock.  After the five minute runaround, i walked out.   Still hungry, about two hours later, I returned and asked to be seated at a regular dining table. Service was still as slow as I expected it would be, but the food was pretty good.    Lower you expectations, which I've done, and life will be good.",

Cold toast. The worst part? Paying $22 for this poor quality, flavorless meal. $5 for the coffee. Talk about gouging for inferior food. Sent the food back to redo. Absolutely not worth it.  Wife had the Bacon Bacon Biscuit, which was cold in the center. Also the way it was described in the menu did not convey it would be served as a sandwich. They also charged for the salsa. Talk about nickel and diming. Will never return here. Dined here for breakfast on Monday, June 18, 2018.  We ate breakfast the next day at Claim Jumper at Golden Nugget. 100% better for much less money.  Again, we were very disappointed and had the impression since it was Caesars, they would strive for better. Not on this occasion. Will never go back.",

I don't know if it's a compliment or embarrassing to say that we stayed here for about five hours. However, in the course of those five hours, we had (each) 1 Bellini, 1 Bloody Mary, 4 cross between a Moscow Mule and Mint Juleps, and a beer. We also were responsible adults and ate. I opted for the chips and guacamole along with the Blackened Mahi Tacos, while my friend had the AMAZING Clam Chowder. Safe to say all the food was devoured and the drinks were slurped down.  I can't sing the praises of this place enough. We loved it so much that my friend and I decided to stay at Caesar's Palace during our next Vegas visit, just so we can hang out at this bar.",

My eggs benedict were perfectly runny, the greens were a great touch, and it was greatly seasoned on an english muffin. My husband enjoyed the huevos rancheros.

However, the quality wasn't even close to being that.  The place itself is nice... with great atmosphere and service. If price isn't an issue, then have a nice casual experience here.

The prices were reasonable, they were not super outrageous like some Hotel restaurants can be. My pizza was amazing and the wings and fries were good too. Mind you we have been partying for about 3 nights so anything probably would have taste good. Lol jk",

The short rib tacos literally melt in your mouth, the sirloin sliders are very moist, the ceviche tacos are very refreshing and the sweet and spicy wings are very saucy but still crunchy.   The Moscow Mule was a little strong but I enjoyed it but the Frozen Spiked Lemonade drinks are what you have to get!!! Especially the Watermelon flavored, it taste like the sour watermelon gummies.   It's outside/indoor near the lobby and the outside patio overlooks the Absinthe garden area, which is perfect for people watching or if you want to see the lights on the strip.",

The food overall was ok but the price for the steak breakfast was probably not worth it (maybe because it was well done) and the sausages also left something to be desired but that is what sausages do I guess.   The carb portion was fantastic (sourdough toast and hashbrown) especially with the Jam jars that it comes with!   Next time I'll try something other than their breakfast menu.",

Food can get expensive here but not as much as other places in the hotel. One of the few breakfast options.   It doesn't matter which time you come. It's always open. This is one of the few restaurants in the hotel you can eat at any time. It's real easy to find. This is right in the lobby. Checking in gets you a free margarita. It comes in a regular glass. This is a pretty good size and it's free so you can't complain much. Breakfast items are pretty standard fare. The toast and jam is about $7, which seems like a lot. It does come with several small jars of jam. There's multiple flavors like grape, marmalade, and strawberry. If this doesn't sound exciting, you're right, it's not. They do give you lots of jam so I ate every one.   For being in an expensive place it's more affordable than other places. It's still a ripoff for some items. The breakfast items are more affordable so go then.",

    "text": "The bottom line is food should make you sing (well good food) and overall after long bouts of instagram hype I really feel like Cafe Americano fell flat for me on so many levels. I'll say it's definitely not the Americano that caught Lady Gaga's attention for sure!  I will say their menu is massive and at least even by Vegas standards will fill the bellies of any shape or size. Since I was a virgin (careful how you throw that around, especially in the city of sin) I was drawn to their tasting menu. A $40 price tag for essentially an appetizer and main course which is a steal nowadays.  I macarena'd towards the guacamole quesadilla which if I wasn't dying of hunger from a 5 hour car ride I would've sent back without hesitation and I NEVER do that. What killed it for me was that it came out in one big melted chunk. It tells me that it had been placed one over the other when it was too hot causing it to congeal together as one. I did like the gooey ness of the asadero cheese so it wasn't all bad, but sad to say it was a giant mess to me.  As for the main course it was their take on the classic chicken and waffles. The star of the night is their chicken. It was hot and moist to the bitter end which had me shaking. The seasoning was on point, but unfortunately the train came off the tracks from there. The bacon stuffed Mac and Cheese Waffle sounded so good on paper, but horribly prepared. The waffle itself was dry and even the syrup (which was brought out about 30 minutes prior to receiving the food) couldn't resurrect much. The macaroni had zero flavor to it and was beyond bland. I took two bites at most and apparently offended by not wanting a doggy bag to take it back to the room with me.  Another item worth mentioning was the service from our waiter. It was a welcome to Vegas dinner with family and he really brought down the mood quickly. It took multiple requests to get simple things like refills and lemon wedges for our water (4 requests actually). He looked so lost throughout the night that we weren't sure whether to feel for him or feed him to the wolves.  I guess they for months followed the wife on Instagram and reached out for feedback which apparently even that seemed as fake as the \"enhancements\" of tinsel town. The survey itself was done via text, but it appeared robotic and wasn't an actual live person. That to me sums up all I really need to know. Don't garner feedback if you really don't care to hear it honestly. Within a city that's constantly changing at the drop of a dime I'd be inclined to listen to the people who come through the doors or those doors will not remain open for too long.   Afterwards they stopped following the wife and safe to say our stomachs will be doing the same. There are plenty of other destinations which deserve these gurgles.",

I understand that certain hotels on the Strip hold themselves to a high standard and their guests demand a certain level of quality. Still, seemingly generic cafes, particularly ones open for 24 hours, don't tend to turn out extraordinary food or service. Cafe Americano is definitely an exception.  Prices are high which frequent visitors to the Strip must be numb to. I'm not quite there yet.",

I especially loved the balsamic glaze & basil dipping sauces that accompanied the dish. The breakfast sandwich on a buttered & toasted brioche bun was fantastic. Our server Raul suggested we swap out the thin bacon the sandwich cones with with their house made thicker bacon. That was a good tip & one we appreciated. Finally, we enjoyed the steak tacos.

I know Vegas is expensive but that's down right ridiculous. The food tasted like the same food you could get at dennys for less than 20 bucks. We didn't even get drinks besides water...otherwise that would have brought us over 60 dollars.   I would pass if you're just going for a quick breakfast.

The bacon was crispy as well, and the butter was easy to spread. My friend ordered the loaded nachos which I took a lot of because it was so big. They did not skimp in the meat, although their avocado was a little lacking. Definitely get the nachos to share since they're huge. Service was okay, considered it was pretty busy.

    "text": "I want to start by saying I was treated to a meal here with some family. I can't comment on their dishes, but I will describe my own.   Looking on the menu at the time, the main dish I wanted to try was their fried chicken with mac n cheese stuff waffle. Their mac n cheese stuffed waffle sounded very interesting to me. So when the waiter came to take my order that was what I decided to order. To my surprise, the waiter told me that someone else had ordered the fried chicken already and that if I ordered it, my meal would take 30 minutes to make. This was ridiculous to me considering the restaurant was very empty at the time. So I couldn't understand why one person's order of fried chicken would cause my order to be delayed for 30 extra minutes.   I decided against the fried chicken and went with the ribeye with a sweet potato and chorizo hash. Surprisingly, my order came out very quickly and I finally got to eating.   First I wanted to try out the sweet potato and chorizo hash. The chorizo was very flavorful and had a hint of spiciness to it that made it a great contrast to the sweet potato, but the big problem was the sweet potato was cooked very poorly. Some pieces were overcooked, while others were slightly on the raw side. This made this side very unpleasant to eat since each mouth full was a mix of good raw and overcooked sweet potato.   Next the ribeye itself, was slightly overcooked (I asked for medium rare). Most of the edges of the steaks were almost welldone and very dry. The steak was also unevenly seasoned. Half my steak needed some salt, which I got from the chorizo, and the other half was well seasoned. They also included a sweet steak sauce, which I did not enjoy. It was too sweet and seemed to have come out of the fridge because it was very cold. Overall, for the price of this steak, I expected much better quality and care for this piece of meat.   I did not pay for this meal, but I felt robbed for my family that paid for this meal. At this price point, I would look elsewhere for steak.",

    "text": "Cafe Americano is the perfect go-to when in Caesar's Palace. This place is a great sit-down restaurant as well all bar, but the best part is that it's 24hours!  The food here is generally pricey, but it's Vegas so pretty much everything here is. The food you get is also very hearty and very American. My fish sandwich was close to $30, but there were some very large pieces of fried fish in the sandwich.   The service here isn't overly tentative, which is perfect if you want to be left alone but not so great if you want more than one glass of water. The cocktail menu is also very extensive!  If you ever end up at Caesars Palace in the dead of night, I would highly recommend you try out Cafe Americano!",

Being on Central Time, we woke up much earlier that expected and this was one of a handful of places open at 6am serving breakfast. We were the first ones seated for breakfast as only the bar is open during the wee-hours of the night/morning. Once seated, no issues with service. Ended up getting the breakfast burrito which came with a side of home fries and marked up at $26... Yikes. Food was fresh and good. But yeah, that price though. Never paid so much for a breakfast burrito I'll tell you that much.  Anyways, when you have no where else to go and stumble upon a 24 hour spot I guess it's a god send. I think the only thing that made the price sting a little bit less was the free margaritas with Yelp check in. Yeah I redeemed it at 6am... Gotta make my money back some how.   'Til next time, cheers!",

Most places get that all the way wrong. I also had them with Nutella. They were huge and fluffy, but fell apart a lot. I was willing to forgive that since they tasted acceptably good. I say acceptable because they were not the best I've ever had in life, but they were good.  My drink was a Bloody Mary, and even that shocked me with how much liquor I tasted. It looks watery and very plain when you stare at it, so I was skeptical. But you really taste a lot of liquor. However, I think the liquor may have been cheap because I didn't get much buzz.   PRICE: Eeeeek! $20 for some pancakes???! Total price tag for a screwdriver, Bloody Mary, milk and pancakes -- $61.  I know I'm in Vegas, but really?? So, your meal will be good enough, and you will pay a hefty price for \"good enough\".",

The chicken was dry, way over cooked, and stringy. I literally had to put some water in my mouth while chewing to soften it up. The asparagus was bland and chewy to the point I had to cut it in individual pieces to swallow because it was not al dente and my teeth couldn't cut through it (and I have some respectable chompers).  The brown rice was good, but hey, I never met a plate of rice I didn't like!  Overall, it wasn't good, and given the price, it was downright bad.  Go elsewhere and spend your money.",

    "text": "Went to Cafe Americano (a Caesars property) during a weekend bachelor party in early October, 2016 for my son, joined by my other son, the groomsmen and my brother. We went to Cafe Americano for drinks and appetizers. When I  was in the process of cashing out, one my son's childhood friends who moved to Vegas and worked at Caesars stopped the Cafe Americano staff from checking me out. He wanted to apply his employee discount to my bills (2). One bill was for $123 and the other $198. I was told drinks were not eligible for the employee discount. The American staff re-rang up the 2nd bill with employee discount applied. I have 2 receipts - one for $123 another for $68. When receiving my credit card notice of the billing - I noted I was charged in full for both, $123 and $198. Tried to work this discrepancy through 2 assistant managers at separate times then finally the head manager for a period of about 3 weeks. Each time I was told they would work with me though nobody would get back to me and nothing was done about the discrepancy. I then disputed with Chase and they tried to work this in my behalf. They sent Chase a $198 receipt with chicken scratch for a signature while I have a physical copy for the $68. I can contest further with Chase or the Attorney General. At this point the effort is not worth it. In the end, Caesars never honored their own employees' of their employee discount privileges. Very disappointed in this dishonest business establishment - won't be back again, that's for sure.",

My first morning( a very early 4:30 AM I was greeted by Taten and Robbie with excellent coffee and a welcome that set the tone of the rest of my trip- amazing!!! These two gentlemen had been up all night and still they were charming, attentive and funny. That goes a long way in Vegas! So I brought my husband back for breakfast and we met Kristina and Richard, a slam dunk!!! Could not have been nicer! The poached eggs and omelet were eggselent!!! Bloody Mary selection was creative and satisfying. These people are first class-kindness, personality, and bringing a bit of home to a great big place! So we finished our trip with a lovely breakfast of smoked salmon platter and omelet and our new friends!!! Same time next year returning with fond memories we will not forget anytime soon!!!",

The Cuban sandwich had nearly 2\" high of pulled pork, a perfect size slice of real country baked ham, Guyere cheese, mayo, pickles and onions, all on a grilled slab of bread with no grease. One-half of the sandwich would've been more than enough. It came with choice of french fries or salad. I had the salad, all a spring mix of greens. My husband got a Reuben with 2\" tall of corned beef and the traditional Reuben items. He got the fries, a very generous, very hot portion. Great atmosphere, sandwiches served on a thick wooden cutting board, linen napkins...manager (in a suit) stopped by our table. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "WOW with just 2 checkins I became a regular!    Cafe Americano is located in Caesar in Vegas.    The service was great!   On the 1st visit they were a bit understaffed but they were so nice it was easy to deal with the wait.  The 2nd visit was at the bar which is a bit odd as it's technically in the hotel lobby.    Two ladies at the table next to me were splitting the eggs bene with the caper hollandaise.  They both warned me that the sauce was a bit peppery but they were working on eating it via attempting to separate yolk from sauce.   The waiter got wind of their issue and had the kitchen remake the order with the milder hollandaise.   The ladies were shocked as they didn't request a refire. THAT'S GREAT SERVICE!!!!!  Breakfast runs between $25-30 dollars but the portions are large enough to share.  They will even divide the entree onto 2 plates.  Bloody Mary's runs $15 and coffee is $5.  This is not a cheap place to dine.  Total Rewards comps are welcomed.    I'd go back the next time I'm in Vegas but I hope I have comps or winning to pay the bill!",

My bad as I should've checked first.    Had a nighttime snack and drinks before bed and they do serve Tito's in the bar and no where else in the casino.  Took a few minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us but maybe he thought we were just trying to get free jalapenos.  Good food but again a bit on the higher side.

I had to stifle my urges to scream because I was so happy with their bacon. It was a big portion, so I couldn't finish it. Took home leftovers and ate it again 6 hours later--  potatoes were STILL delicious, even when I ate it cold. Only strange thing was that we had so many different people serving us, I wasn't quite sure who our waiter was. (Maybe this is due partially to my intoxication) anyway we had to ask twice for ketchup but it might've been because we asked the wrong person for ketchup the first time.  Summary:  1.

After we sat down it took 20 more minutes to get menus. They only had 14 hookah flavors (which is nothing). They brought out our hookah and the hookah was broken and the manager said \"oh yeah I just wrapped tape around it\" which clearly means the whole hookah is messed up. Extremely harsh and we asked for another one. Coals cost money if you want them replaced. The whole hookah overall was 40 dollars and I've had better for 15.

It was huge, just like most of the \"over the top\" entrees served in Las Vegas. For breakfast I had Eggs Benedict which were also very delicious. Service each time was great and never rushed.",

I even had my small dog in a carrier next to my feet and there were no issues since it was so hot outside. I'd recommend. Staff was friendly, drinks were always filled, and the service was quick.",

We go in, nice atmosphere, the servers were good but each one of them had too many tables. We order a breakfast burrito, a cafe americano frittata and orange juice. Everything was not only looking great but was really delicious too. But these prices! We could have eaten at least twice as much for this amount of money somewhere else. I know that Vegas is not a cheap town as a whole but the other places in which we ate were with much more reasonable prices.  So even though my girl and I loved the place and the food, we wont be paying so much money for a meal again.",

This trip, however, was the first time we tried their amazing (but pricey) breakfast.    Waiter was great and the parade of food coming out to tables looked amazing.    The $8 for a 6-8oz orange juice was a bit insulting (and as far as \"fresh squeezed\" goes I've had better for sure).    Otherwise, we were quite satisfied.  After leaving the absurd food court pizza place, we found that Cafe Americana offered great pizza, at a slightly cheaper price, and in a comfortable environment.   But I love this place.   It's expensive but hits the mark.   I don't remember (about a decade ago) a restaurant in its place (or the same restaurant before remodeling) offered a killer wedge salad I no longer see on the menu.    Bummer.",

    "text": "The first time we came here was on our first trip to Vegas back in February. It was easy because it was inside Ceasars Palace. I'm giving it 4 stars because I remember the horrible experience we had with one of the hostess- she wasn't accommodating or courteous. There were empty tables but they won't sit anyone who isn't a diamond member or something and the line outside was growing. Eventually we were sat but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth when things like this happen. The servers/ waiters on the other hand are simply amazing. They're attentive, respectful, jolly and make amazing suggestions. The portions are really big so sharing is always a good option. They have a nice breakfast selection. But if sweet juice isn't your thing, stay away from the cranberry and grapefruit. I'm not sure if these are from the box or can but they're too sweet for our taste. Their food in general is very good, the burgers in particular  that means a lot especially coming from me since I'm not really into burgers. But you know it's a good one when I finish it and commit to ordering it again next time  the hostesses seem better now that we have returned in December. We saw the rude hostess the other day but that's ok. All in all, it's a good place to enjoy a meal at anytime of the day or night since it's open 24 hours and have a nearby toilets. Price wise, it's up to you if it gets expensive or stay within reason.",

Now, Sunday morning was a different story. Completely different server. Asked for the plates to be split again and none of them were split. The tea tasted old, leftover.

Service: Once we were seated the waiter took our drink orders and disappeared. When he reappeared he still did not have our drinks. Instead of staying the bar was backed up or that they were coming out momentarily. After about 15 min I finally asked for the drinks. Since he were returned to the table very quickly I'm guessing that he forgot about our drinks. The food took FOREVER to come. I'm guessing that he also forgot to put our food in. When we asked the manager where the food was he just indicated that they were busy without any pleasantries or apologies. Once we asked for checks he handed me the bill and told me to split the check my self -we were sitting with two other couples. Once he returned with our cards he gave them to me instead of giving each person their cards back. I dine out frequently this was just a mess. Food: I ordered the chicken and waffles which was supposed to be one of one of their specialities. The waffle had too many flavors fused together. The chicken was... sweet. Odd. I just wasn't a fan of this place.",

The all AMERICAN breakfast is great, but at $22 not sure I think it's great at $18 it's eggs and potatoes with no special flare to them.. charge me more sure but please show me more give me more effort.

Our visit to Cafe Americano for dinner was very unpleasant. After about 15 min of ordering our pizza the waiter comes back and says that they're out of pizza. Unfortunately, that was the only thing we could afford on the menu and we had no clue that they were out of it until a while after we ordered. We decided to leave the restaurant starving. On our way out we let the manager Ari know about the situation. As a courtesy he said he would give us complimentary breakfast the next morning. However, when we came the next morning his co-manager said they could only give a discount. After much arguing and misleading information, they decided to give breakfast for us on the house.   On the other hand, their all American breakfast was good. Portion was great in size and delicious.",

Between the 8 of us, we ordered a mix of breakfast and lunch items. 3 of us ordered the all American breakfast. Not one of us ate the eggs, and we couldn't even pawn them off on the rest of our group.  The lollipop wings were decent, but for the price I would expect to be blown away. I personally ordered the buffalo and was very disappointed at the extremely basic sauce and the fact that the wings were not all cut to be lollipop wings. It just shows that they are not monitoring the quality of food they are providing.  The service did not reflect the 18 percent gratuity that was added to our checks since we were a party of 8. In reality I would have probably given a less than 10 percent at most.  Overall I would highly recommend everyone to stay away from this place.",

He walked away, still no drinks ordered (we were seated at the bar which had approximately 5 bar tenders working to maybe 7 people seated).   After a few more minutes we finally managed to get a drink order in, my boyfriend had a vodka and cran I had SODA WATER AND LIME, both came in extremely small glasses overflowing with ice. I drank my water in a few seconds as there was really only about a half ounce of water in the cup, no lime.   At this point we were reconsidering food due to the rudeness of the bar tender so we closed our tab after 1 drink. Total? $19. We were charged $13 for a extremely weak vodka cran AND $6 for under an ounce of water. He then made some statement about if we wanted a table we should go to the hostess, to which we replied no thanks.   You can go to any number of friendlier high end dining/drinking places about 100 yards away. Walk by this place, don't get tempted, you can do better!",

The server ensured that he communicated our preferences with the chef and returned any given responses and knowledge upon our wishing to. Considerate and friendly, our server was everything we could had asked for. Although his knowledge of the menu could be improved upon, the server had still done a well, and thus I decided to not count this into the review.

GM came over again to make sure everything was good which it was and we let him know. Luis is a good server ask for him if you go. Food was ok. It's loud inside.",

After I drank a whole bottle of Bacardi at the pool, I was craving something that would absorb the alcohol. I decided to try out Cafe Americano just for the fun of it. Prices here are super high but that's what you'd expect from a 5 star resort.  The waiter was attentive and quick to take my order. Water was the only thing I can drink after devouring the whole bottle of Bacardi. I ordered the poke salad that came with fresh tuna, seaweed salad and other Asian veggies. Food was excellent. The ambiance was classy as was the rest of Caesar's Palace.  Nothing was cheap at this tourist trap so since I was too hungry to walk across the strip for a cheaper dinner. This place had to do with it being a few feet away from the elevator.   Next thing that happened, the liquor started to kick in and I ended up vomiting the whole meal in the restroom! Ugh...",

Bloody Mario's are great, coffee isn't lol. Tortellini is good, Denver omelet was meh. The waiter was having a rough day, didn't listen when I said no dairy, had to take back my food and the new food took 20 min to come out which was frustrating. Didn't fill waters or check on us until it was time to collect money. One waiter was on top of stuff, the other (one we had) wasn't. Food was decent, pricing is high but that's Vegas. They're open 24/7, and have breakfast all day which has its appeal.",

Payed $14 bucks ($8 for 2 fried eggs and $6 for some piece of cheap looking and tasting white bread), not counting on tip and taxes! Insane! Ended up paying around $20.

The service was nice, very quick four requests. However,  the food itself was not great, and to price a burger at $23, regardless of where, I still expect juicy bites. I ended up getting the Carolina Melt; the portion size was definitely nice,  but the burger itself seemed lacking in flacor and a little dry in my opinion. Also, there was an imbalance of cheese, covering every bite. The classic burger also did not look too appealing, seeming a little bland. However, its convenience definitely helped.",

We ordered bunch of food including $45 (maybe 47) steak visioning a French chef putting fingers near his lips saying things I wouldn't understand. Hell no.... it was no better than $15-ish steak from Sizzler.... quite possibly worse.  I've never tried a poke so can't really tell if it's good or not, but it didn't impress me at all.  Clam chowder was GOOD.  It had lots of real clams and thick bacon pieces.  Bacon was a bit too thick to my taste, but still it was one of the best I've ever tried.  Food overall was better than other famous places, but prices were extreme.  I won't visit this place if costs wouldn't be covered.  Looks like everything in Vegas are now bubbled up where hotels provide and cover very high limit on meals, but food prices all went up as well.  There's no chance that I pay for it on my own.  On a side note.... I am one to think and say racism doesn't really exist in US, but I sensed strange racially biased vibes all along in Vegas.  Staff at many places were saying nonsense and didn't seem to answer what we asked.  This place was the only exception in Vegas where I didn't \"felt\" being a bit discriminated.... maybe I just looked poor....  Anyhow, I felt welcomed here.  Will I come back ?  Unlikely.",

The Fish and Chips were fresh and delicious and the Roasted Chicken with fingerling potatoes, charred green beans and tender asparagus spears was outstanding.  Our Caesar salads were crisp and perfectly dressed.  While we were pleased to have found such good food, our dinner was raised to a whole new level by our waiter Saul.  He was the BEST!  A perfect melding of professionalism and personality.  He took care of our every need and helped guide our dinner selections.  Saul took a very good dinner experience and make it into a memorable one.

McDonald's probably does a better job on chicken nuggets as these were still slightly frozen in the center. My Mom took one and hers was more frozen in the center than the one I tried.

First we sat at the bar since you can order food there too, but the bartenders were too busy attending to 2 tipsy blondes' needs. So we decided to ask for a table on their outside patio, only to find out later that the menus are different inside vs outside (pretty silly if you ask me). We finally got a table inside and even though the cafe was pretty much empty on a Saturday, the service was nonexistent. Our waitress didn't show up for about 10-15 minutes to get our order. The food was yummy, except for their grilled mahi mahi which was too salty. The skinny flat iron steak fry was very tasty and filling. For the prices they have, they should definitely step up their service game!  I would probably give it a 3.5",

We ordered the sliders and the mac and cheese. Both really good. The service was good too. Biggest problem is the price. Average price of entree was $20+ per plate. Expect most items to be twice the price of any similar venue outside the casinos.  The second time we ate there was this morning, we were running late and just checked out. I ordered a breakfasr burrito and mimosa. Gotta say the mimosa was fantastic. The breakfast burrito was so-so. Again this place is very conveninent if your other options are limited.",

Our waiter was very friendly and personable. I ordered the short ribs nachos and smokehouse burger w/ the salad amongst all the other dishes my family ordered. It wasn't until this burger that I realized how important patty density is. This burger was perfect in that department. The portions were relatively large and left my family feeling satisfied. Prices are a little expensive but for the quality and location, what do you expect. I ordered my typical drink, the Gin mule which came in copper mug, which is very crucial. The drink was very balanced, better then a lot of other mules I've had around town. I wouldn't hesitate to come back if I'm in the area.",

I ordered the egg white wrap and got the cilantro crema and ranchera salsa on the side. $2 for a side of salsa but again to be expected. My grandmother got the Belgian waffles. Both were delicious! And I'm normally not a huge fan of hash browns but I liked theirs. Our service was also very nice. There was some kind of mix up and I ended up with a burger with bacon I didn't order but they got it fixed promptly! For having the word cafe in their name I didn't see anything other than regular coffee but maybe I just missed it. All in all a good experience.",

Since I had only consumed a protein shake and was starving, and was planning on a late after-show dinner, I decided to get something that would \"stick\" with me: Pasta!  The chicken carbonara mac and cheese had perfectly al dente penne pasta along with a fantastic cream sauce, just enough cheese, and large pieces of crispy bacon and moist chicken breast pieces.  It was an excellent meal.  Their soup is only sold by the bowl, not by the cup, which was disappointing.  Also disappointing to a family member was their lack of Eggs Benedict on the abbreviated all-day breakfast section.  But the do give out condiments in tiny little glass bottles and jars!  Our waiter did keep vanishing for long periods of time, so it was very difficult to order additional items or get refills.  Hence only 4 stars.  The prices made me go a little wide-eyed, but I wasn't paying, so I didn't really consider it.",

I had asked for some sriracha to go and he said they didn't have it.  What a liar.  I called him out on that too calling him a liar.

Open 24/7 but Very cute set up, a little more on the trendy side and not your normal 24/7 cafe place.   Our food was delicious. We all got a variety of different things, and they all were great! We had the Octopus Pizza, the Burger, the Breakfast Platter, and the applewood smoked ham and turkey sandwich.  The thing that truly made our visit great was the service from everyone Danielle our waitress- Jonathon- our waiter/bus boy and the Bar Manager Adrian. Everyone was so friendly and great. I would like to especially recognize Jonathon for his above and beyond service to us, even offering us water cups to go since it's hot outside! He was great.  We will definitely be back. I am in the restaurant industry and heard this is their first one on the West Coast- so I truly do wish you all the best of Luck! Continue with the great food and service and you will do well- that's the recipe for success! Thanks again and see you all next time!",

The server refused to come by and fill up our water, and essentially avoided our table; taking preference to the tables full of drunk girls. When we addressed the manager, he took 15 minutes to even respond to our claim and when he did he raised his voice and threw the bill on the table. I have never received such rude, neglectful service in my entire life. And as a service industry worker, I can barely believe the level of gross incompetence and inattention to guests at this establishment. I would not go back here if it were the last place in vegas to eat and I was starving.",

First of all, it is ever-so-slightly cheaper than Cafe Bellagio (okay, $1-$2 isn't much, but still). Don't get me wrong, I don't eat or drink at places like Caeser's Palace and Bellagio to save money, but it is still an indicative factor.  Second, hash browns, much better than CB, smaller portion, BUT- you also get toast. At CB toast was a separate side item, cost extra. What.  Third, the toast comes unbuttered so you can portion the butter yourself. Thank you! More places need to do this!  Fourth, the service, once seated, was phenomenal. I believe I was helped by Ryan K, at least that's what is on my receipt, and he was prompt, courteous, professional, and checked back often to ensure I had everything I needed. More servers need to do this!  Getting seated, however, was disastrous. It wasn't even busy. Lots of open tables, but for each group in line they were setting up tables ad-hoc. Maybe I came right after a huge rush left? I don't know, I'm not docking any stars for this - I just felt for being third in line, that the wait was kind of laughable.  Will definitely be back.",
