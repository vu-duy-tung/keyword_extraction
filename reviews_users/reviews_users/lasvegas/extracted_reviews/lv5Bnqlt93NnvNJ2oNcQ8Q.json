I might think about giving it another try but maybe I'll be giving it a bit longer to see if maybe the food gets better with time. My husband only took 2 bites of his burrito and was finished because he couldn't eat any more. We were still charged for it although it was barely touched. They never came to ask how things were or if they could get us anything else after dropping the food the next thing dropped was the check. They have the bones to make this a great spot but there certainly needs to be some work done to make the food better.",

(We had to ask the bartender to get our waitress.)  My wife ordered the romaine salad with salmon. I ordered El Suegro, a combo of  tortilla soup, shrimp stewed with onion abd peppers in a tomato sauce and a fajita beef taco covered in a chili cheese sauce. My wife's salmon was crispy it was so overcooked; the waitress said it wasn't hard, just dry and she had told the \"chef.\"   My soup was so salty, I couldn't  eat the broth, but did eat the vegetables. The stewed shrimp was disgusting. The shrimp tasted fishy and old in a canned tomato sauce wutg stewed onion and peppers. The fajita beef taco was as bad as tge shrimp: some dark colored, shredded meat (?) rolled in a flour tortilla  and smothered in a canned nacho sauce with sprinkles if salsa. I left almost the entire meal,  except what I tasted. No adjustment to the bill.  We won't  be back, even if it manages to stay in business",

I didn't see a carne asada plate on the menu so asked the waitress who suggested I get a beef fajita plate. Instead of carne asada, it was seasoned ground beef (like hamburger meat) cut into strips. Tortillas were homemade and good, rice and chips, etc. good but it was $18 for that meal. Also tried cheese enchiladas another time which were just OK. Flaming Fajita is a lot better.",

But the owner and managers had asked me to come in and give them a second chance. I can honestly say now that we will definitely be recommending this restaurant to our friends as well as returning very soon. Our server, Gregorio, was excellent and the manager, Jesus, both went above and completely beyond our expectations to give us a much better experience. But not only was the service fantastic, the drinks and the food really were of the greatest quality! Everything is made completely fresh. From the guacamole to the queso with beef dip, to the homemade corn and flour tortillas for our fajitas. We had the fajitas with the chicken and steak topped with Serrano peppers, bacon and Monterey Jack cheeses. I highly recommend them for your entree here! I normally do not like beef fajitas from restaurants because the steak usually ends up being chewy, but definitely NOT these! The beef was so tender and flavorful!  If you're trying to decide on a beverage, the sangria swirl was soooooo good as well and very strong! We will definitely be back soon and if you're deciding whether to check this place out, you should and ask for Gregorio!",

    "text": "Moving here from Texas six years ago, one of the things I truly have missed is Tex-Mex food.  The Mexican food out here has been disappointing.  When I saw they were opening this place, I wondered if it was the same Los Cucos as the ones in Houston.  When I walked in and asked them, I was elated to find out that it was the same!   And that they have the same menu.  They have an On The Border here, which is a Tex-Mex place, however, the menu is very different than the ones in Texas.  The Los Cucos menu was not.  It was the same!!!   I was very, very pleased to see that the cheese enchiladas were served with chili con carne or chili gravy instead of the disgusting red or green chile that most of these west coast places put on their enchiladas.  And they were good.  And the refried beans were perfect.  Some places make them too runny.  These were very good.  The service was excellent.  I had multiple managers come to the table and speak with me, and that was great.  My two complaints were that I was not a fan of the rice.  Although, I remember I didn't care for it when I went to the locations in Texas either.  For some reason, there was corn and carrots in it.  Just give me plain Spanish Rice.  Also, I used to like the red sauce they served with the chips in Texas.  However, I was not a fan of either of the sauces they served with the chips, and they were a little stale.  Also, the menu said they have Shiner Bock beer, and they do not.  At least not yet.  I hope they will eventually.  Overall, I was very happy with the meal and the service and very happy to have a place like this in Las Vegas finally!",

    "text": "I'm usually never craving Mexican food unless it's tacos, but I tried this place out and I am so pleased. To start, I eat out alot (obviously) and I had the best customer service from all staff members ... Literally the best customer service I've ever had at a restaurant. Our server was Jose. he was super energetic and enthusiastic. The manager (I think) stopped by our table also to ask how everything was. Chips and salsa came out fresh and warm. Wasn't a fan of the red salsa only because there was no heat, and I'm a fan of anything spicy. The green salsa was cool and refreshing. My boufriend and I both got chimichangas and OMG they were the best I've ever had. We got chicken and beef and both were amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked, packed full of flavor and so juicy !! The same with the beef. I preferred the beef one more and made my boyfriend switch me. It was so delicious I could not stop saying \"omg this is so good\".. the portions were also really big. I'm not a fan of rice and beans so my server substituted those for tortilla soup, free of charge! Soup was full of flavor but didn't have any meat in it. I wasn't bothered by it because I was more focused on my chimichangas. For dessert we got the trio. I would only recommend this for parties of 4+ as the portion was way bigger than the picture. Two giant scoops of ice cream covered in toasted coconut . Brownies and mini churros. The churros were piping hot and super fresh. Truly the best churros I've had in Vegas! We had such a hard time finishing this dessert. The plating was also really nice and clean. Overall I'm really happy with this place on all levels. Very clean, awesome service , and super flavorful food with big portions. I will definitely be back!!",

He started to take our drink orders. Kinda. He took two peoples orders and then left to attend to another table. Then when I brought it up, he was annoyed. He then took all of our drink orders, except left out one person again.  It was my brother in laws birthday. Granted we were there on Cinco de Mayo, the table next to us also had a birthday. We had asked for the balloon lady and band to come sing for him. Come to find out they didn't know what table they were there for. So it was awkward.  The food is always on point. No going wrong there. Just the service is lacking. If you can sit in the bar. Top service there... avoid Miguel. He just needs more training.",

I cannot describe how happy I am to finally have a Mexican restaurant (besides taco shops) on this side of town! Our server this time was Lupita. She was super friendly and took amazing care of us on a busy Friday night.  I ordered their Los Cucos fajitas again. It's loaded with well flavored meat, sauteed mushrooms & onions and other veggies. Topped with jalapenos for some added spice and served with their homemade tortillas  Chips, salsa and the guac salsa are great too. We also really like the chili con queso as an appetizer.  They offer table side guacamole.  Margaritas are on point and served in a generous glass...no skimping on the liquor either. My favorite is their Cadillac margarita on the rocks.  Be sure to save room for dessert!  It is a Tex-Mex style Mexican restaurant.   Live mariachi music on a Friday night. The band walks from room to room serenading you as you enjoy your meal.",

Honestly the only Mexican restaurant we go to as my fiance is Mexican and nothing touches his parents food EXCEPT this place is the closet we get to authentic Mexican food here in Vegas. My fiancee always gets the chimichanga and loves it. I decided to splurge this last time and get the lobster stuffed shrimp. SOOOO worth it. I always get a new drink off their very creative drink menu, haven't disliked one of them. Are waiter was AMAZING we unfortunately didn't get his name but his service was so attentive and literally refilled our drinks before they hit the table empty. We always leave full and happy which is honestly the best way to leave any restaurant.",

    "text": "EXTREMELY disappointed in our last to go order. I have dined here several times and have had the fajitas a la pablanas with shrimp. A picture of their menu is on Yelp and this dish is there. It is CLEAR that you order a fajita style and pick your protein. My mother and I ordered a to go order of these fajitas to serve two. When I got to the restaurant I read my receipt and they had given us the pollo pablanos dinner but substituted shrimp. I started this was wrong, explained our order, and was asked to sit while they remade the dish. Of course, I was fine with this. 10 minutes later the manager came out and asked how I was doing. I said I was fine and was waiting on a remade to go order. He asked about what happened. I told him. He said he would go into the kitchen make sure it was right, but to be sure, show him what we wanted. I pointed to the menu. Pointed at the picture. He said they were again going to make the wrong thing and rushed to the back. He came back out, and I asked him with the menu in my hand and pointing, to confirm it was the correct dish. He assured me it was and said he would just charge us for the wrong dishes since they were cheaper to compensate for my trouble. He then proceeded to tell me he yelled at the order taker and made her cry and that they had 400 occupents so they were busy (a. I'd never ever want a server to cry for a simple mistake and b. I'm not sure the restaurant can hold 400, but I digress.) I get home and the dish is still wrong. It was horrible. No sauce. Rubbery shrimp with the tails on. No poblano peppers and DEFINITELY not fajitas. We called 5 times that night (because they weren't answering the phone and we had to keep trying) and they claimed they didn't make this dish. You know, the one I pointed to the picture of. They finally agreed to credit my card and said it would take 5 business days. Flash to 10 business days later and me calling because I still have not be reimbursed. The manager continues to claim they don't make this dish and never have, even though it's on the menu and I've ordered it multiple times. I just want my money back. The manager is put out by this and says he has to research the transaction and to call back in an hour. Alas, they never answered the phone that afternoon. I'm out my money. I REGRET ever telling people to go there. It's a shame. We were frequent customers but this has turned us off of the place completely.",

Wish they would move from this traditional meat rice beans dinner meals to more fun tacos and less filler foods like rice and beans.

Hubby got a platter that had a grilled steak with enchiladas.  I got a grilled tilapia platter wth a jicama/radish slaw on top with a side of black bean soup and charred corn with poblano peppers on the side.  It also came with white rice but that was completely unnecessary. Huge portions.    I only have two complaints 1.) the steak had a thick gristle streak in it.  Hubby ate around it but was tender otherwise and seasoned nicely.  2.) also, the black bean soup was mostly beans but were perfectly cooked.  There was hardly any broth which was a shame for me because it was absolutely delicious. Next time I will ask for less beans and more broth.  I'm still giving this restaurant a five though because what I loved the most about Los Cucos was the amazing service!  It was busy but you wouldn't know it.  Victor our server was very friendly and attentive.  Our glasses were never empty and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and came over several times to check on us.  We will definitely be back!",

I ordered a margarita he recommended and it was good but had I seen the rather extensive drink menu I would have tried something else for sure!

The ambiance was strange, I felt like it was trying to be an authentic Mexican restaurant, but couldn't quite get there. It was \"cold\" and lacked that home-like feeling one typically would encounter.  The wait staff was nice, though our service felt rushed.    I ordered the La Bonita Plate (3 pcs) chicken fajita quesadillas, (1 pc) beef fajita taco covered with chile con queso and (1 pc) chile con queso puff tostada.  Honestly, it was lacking and for $16.99 I expected more.  The Chicken Quesadllas were mostly cheese, The beef  fajita taco, was not a taco at all.  It was a rolled torilla with meat in it; That's it meat and tortilla, with some cheese wizz queso (I should have taken a picture).    What surprised me was the chile con queso puff tostada.  This wasnt even a tostada; It was simply a torilla that was blown up like a balloon (hallow and empty inside).  There was nothing inside and some of the wizz on top.  Taco Bell has out performed this meal.    I will tell you that two of my co-workers ordered the Super Salad and raved about them.  From the looks of it - they were well portioned.  Neither of them could finish their dish.  What really prompted me to write this?  Well besides the mediocre food, it was our first time here.  I certainly did not expect anything from telling our waiter this, but I would have thought that he would have had some good recommendations.  His suggestions seemed random and disingenuous.  I may or may not be back, the jury is still out...",

They had everything that I my family would make for breakfast and lunch. They had eggs, waffles, sausage, bacon, tacos, tacos dorados, Chile's rellenos, enchiladas, ceviche, fruit, hot chocolate, pan dulce, flan, arroz con leche, cereal, milk, juice, horchata, Jamaica, and agua de pepino... there was wayyy more food than I can remember!

It can really vary, depending on the region that inspired the menu, and family recipes.   I can say this, there is True heart and soul in the food here. I had their bacon wrapped shrimp, which was perfectly seasoned, and oh so very tasty. We also had the shrimp stuffed avocado. Wow. It was a first for us, but it was as good as it sounds!   Normally, we are super picky, and impossible to please. The rice might not be great, or the beans might be bland. Here, everything was just exceptional. Great beans, tasty rice, and perfect tortillas.   We spent nearly a year in Mexico, and it still took several months to find the \"right\" tortillas. These might even be better!   We couldn't stop telling the staff how excellent everything was.   I normally don't take the time to post Yelp reviews, but this place absolutely earned my time.   My only regret is that we are not local. If you are local, appreciate your luck in having an awesome, authentic Mexican restaurant with such a delicious menu. Best meal I've had in quite some time.   Next time we come to Vegas, we WILL be back!",

I mean you take one bite of any one of the delicious meats or veggies on this plate: beef, chicken, shrimp (and by shrimp I mean the biggens), fish, pork, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and you're instantly in culinary heaven. Someone told me their food is made from scratch and I'm bound to believe this is True, the beans look like they were given love and care from your abuelita's kitchen prepped the day before. The service we got from Eloisa was fantastic. Margaritas served by Brenda behind the bar are expertly made and a few sips of it sneak up on you fast. I highly recommend drinking first cause once the food comes out it's all you'll be concentrating on. Definitely had leftovers to take home, their plates are big.",

I think that the place is a great place for families to eat some decent Mexican food.   Best things about this place we enjoyed were  Chorizo queso dip   Fresh tortillas they were definitely home made so buttery and I would come back just to have this  Fajitas were good too. The only thing we didn't enjoy about this was the menu said it was filet mignon and it definitely wasn't filet mignon you can't fool me on that it was thick flank.   The portions are also huge so you can definitely share 1 plate for two or just don't order an extra appetizer like we did and enjoy the fresh chips n salsa that's free when you eat here. Service was awesome from start to finish. Overall I would come back more if the refried beans were a smoother texture but other than that it's a solid place the only reason I'm giving a 3 star versus a 4 was for the steak issue we had. But it's a solid 4",

They had everything from chile rellenos, elote, enchiladas, chilaquiles, tacos, menudo, omelettes, tamales, empanadas, champurrado, chicken and mole, horchata etc and everything was delicious. I would say my favorite was probably the empanadas and the carnitas tacos (they have a little station where someone prepares it for you). They were both exploding with flavor. Maybe a little greasy but in my opinion it gives it so much flavor haha! There is so much good food that I didn't get to try all the desserts. I got full on all the delicious food they have available. And they have a ton of those too. Also they use plastic cups for the agua frescas so you can take them to go! Will definitely come back and finish trying all the desserts. And to stuff my face again lol. Loved it here!",

First wondering how long this was going to stay closed and then when it was going to open....Lol  Once I saw that it was open and I read that it was supposed to be Tex Mex...I dragged my bf there for lunch... I'm from Texas and it had been so long since I had good Tex Mex...I had to give this place a try.  The chips were good... Perfectly crispy and the red sauce and the green sauce were both good. The first batch of chips were served room temp but the second basket (Yes I was a little porker) was served warm which was a great surprise. The red sauce was served warm which I thought was a great touch! 5/5  My bf got the cheese enchiladas and he said they were decent but nothing to write home about.   I got the fried avocado with beef with the tortilla soup. I was sadly disappointed. The tortilla soup had mushrooms in it... Which I have never seen in any tortilla soup ever and the tortilla strips were totally soggy... So no texture. Flavor was ok but it was not like any tortilla soup that I have ever had. It was more like a vegetable soup with tortilla thrown in. :( The fried avocado was decent. The crust was fried to  golden crispiness and the avocado was decent. It did not taste that ripe to me. And I guess to finish this all off was that the beef was tough with lots of cartilage and fat. Flavor was actually good but I had to spit out quite a few bites. (1/5)  Service was actually quite good. I didn't catch my server's name but that guy never stopped moving once. He went from table to table to table to table to table... He was like Energizer Bunny....Lol 5/5  Most likely I will try this place again... But I'm not chomping at the bit.",

As a former greeter you need someone with a smile and be at least a little thankful to smile at your customers.  Then she didn't input the order properly.   Three: as we were waiting for our food a few people walked in and no one was there to help them.  The young lady left to the back and people were waiting for a while to be seated.   Four: when our food came out they didnt even review our order with us they just said here   I would not recommend this place to anyone there are other restaurants with way better service and same or better price.  Most that have gambling will comp some drinks which is a bonus.  And if ordered out, they will review the order with customers.    If you need recommendations let me know. I love Mexican food.",

I tried the del rio enchiladas and I was left underwhelmed. 4 small shrimp per tortilla and absolutely no crab meat. To top it all off, came with a pinto bean soup that tasted like bacon water. Like I said, I liked the beverage. Bartender was friendly ambience was casual. I may come back to have a drink or two, they seemed to-have great weekly specials.  I'll pass on the food.",

Service was friendly and the speed from ordering to the food reaching the table felt perfect. The waitress recommended the steak chimichanga as well as a few other items on the menu. that chimichanga looked pretty enticing so I decided to go with the recommendation, and I was very grateful that I did. The chimichanga came out perfect, with a wonderful texture to the fried tortilla it was encased in, to the overall temperature, and the flavor of all ingredients inside. The steak was tender and quite fulfilling to the taste buds, and the rice and beans paid an excellent contribution to the overall experience. It landed at $20, with the meal, soda and just shy of an 18% tip. Chips and salsa were provided along with a refreshing thin avocado salsa that was great. there is no doubt that I will come back to this place in the near future!",

He had no idea what it was that seemed strange to me. The horchata was watered down. Don't think I'll be going there again, it wasn't for me.",

The Spinach Enchiladas are the best that I have eaten anywhere; substitute the Mexican rice for the white rice if you want even more flavor.

This review is complete opposite of my 1st visit a year and a half ago because I couldn't believe the manager went back and forth with me over \"extra cheese!\" I usually dine in when I come here and always order the same thing cooked the same way. Stuffed Avocado with Beef, Extra White and Yellow Cheese. Well my visit a couple days ago was for take out. I ordered the exact same thing as always. When I got my to go order I took a fork to open the avocado and there was a small amount of Yellow Cheese with Beef. I asked one of the waitresses to please give me a side of White Cheese. She went to the back and out came Wynne the Lady Manager who took my order and a Little Man Manager who started talking to Wynne in Spanish as he punched some buttons on the cash register. He pulled up and printed my receipt showing me that Wynne didn't charge me for EXTRA CHEESE! I told the little man that I eat here often, order the same thing and am NEVER charged for Extra Cheese! In fact other managers have given me free dessert because I praise their food so highly every time I come. He went back and forth with me then finally said OK I'll give it to you this time but next time I'll charge you. If this wasn't the ONLY Mexican Restaurant that made Stuffed Avocados I'd NEVER visit this establishment AGAIN!!! The little man left a bad taste in my mouth but it was soon replaced by the Delicious Stuffed Avocado I ate when I finally made it home clear on the other side of town! Yes I drive about 40 minutes to come here for good Mexican Food! Not so much for PETTY Extra Cheese talk!!!!",

I do not like much spicy food but still was able to eat a lot. The juices were a little watered down but still with flavor. The hot chocolate, coffee with cinnamon and champorado were very good. The dessert table was also scrumptious. The only reason I didn't give 5 star was - there were no labels on everything. We had to flag down a server and keep asking what the food were. Even the ceviche choices were the best. If there were labels maybe (saying also if spicy) then we can avoid waste. Overall the food and service were great!",

Fushion?   Wife ordered stuffed avacado and the presentation was uniquely nice. Taste was bland. Got Salt?  Yelp 15% coupon check in expires on 9-30-17, but requires to be printed before coming.  Manager came by and asked how did everything taste.  I asked him about the sauce on my burrito and he said that's how it is in Texas.

We heard they have stuffed deep fried avocados so that intrigued us.  We came on Saturday, around 5ish and the restaurant was half empty so we got seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The menu is like no other, not your typical Mexican restaurant. We all ordered dishes that we have never had before and were very happy, and full!  I had chicken stuffed deep fried avocado that came with tortilla soup, rice and beans and a beef fajita soft taco (I think). I didn't try the beef fajita soft taco because I was full from the stuffed avocado. This restaurant will definitely be our go to for Mexican food.",

    "text": "Los Cucos, a family-owned Texas chain, has been open in this location for about 1.5 years.  This is our second visit.  We'd visit more often, but don't live close.  We had concluded our business at neighboring Men's Wearhouse, so decided to have an early lunch at Los Cucos.  We arrived at 10:43; the restaurant doesn't open until 11:00 AM.  The hostess was very nice and told me that we could come inside.  When I returned a minute or two later with my husband, the manager greeted us and told us he'd be glad to seat us in the restaurant.  He saw us to a table and chatted with us about the restaurant's history.  He brought us two very welcomed cervezas.  Before we knew it, we had chips, salsa and an avocado dip.  Lupita provided excellent service.  People checked on us throughout the meal, including the chef, the waitress and the manager.  We each had a chicken taco which was stuffed with chicken, as well as sauteed onions.  We split a spinach quesadilla.  That was too much food for seniors; we've gotta learn to start sharing meals.  We were never without water.  Our check came quickly.  We really appreciate the level of customer service which allowed us to be seated before the restaurant opened.  It's too darn hot to sit in a car in a parking lot in Las Vegas waiting for a restaurant to open.  We wouldn't have done that; we would have headed for our end of the valley and stopped elsewhere on our way home.  This GM knows how to develop customer loyalty.",

Upon entering, the setting is gorgeous & spacious with a modern cultural ambience ala Mexicana. Be assured, that excellent service & smiles from the staff are contagious in delivering a rewarding dining experience. As a visitor during it's grand opening week, I was immediately greeted by the manager, Jesus, and guided with glowing recommendations. I selected the \"Carnitas ala Michoacana\" from their lunch menu. The presentation was impressively artistic & its flavors exploding in the diversity of fried juicy pork bathing in fresh tomatillo sauce while accented with queso fresco & crisp sliced onions. Add in fresh handmade corn tortillas with moist Mexican rice & refried beans. The value & generous portions are too hard to ever pass up. I look forward to providing a follow up review of their Seafood, children's menu & Desserts.  Located at Arroyo Crossing Parkway Plaza, \"Los Cucos\" is destined to become the community's social & dining benchmark.  \"Bien Provecho Amigos!\"",

I've watched for months as they converted the place into a mexican restaurant and eagerly waited for them to open. The food is really good. The salsas they bring out with the chips are not traditional. The red salsa was heated in the oven and the greenish salsa was like an aioli mayo based concoction. I didn't mind either but my friend was not a fan.  Margaritas were cheap and very good. We ordered a large variety platter for 2 people to share and it was so good. We received steak and chicken fajitas, grilled shrimp, a green onion and bacon sauce, rice, beans and more.  The perfectly seasoned steak was so tender it just fell apart in my mouth. After that I didn't expect much from the chicken but it was also perfectly seasoned and so soft. I would definitely give the food 5 stars and the staff could not have been any more friendly and on top of things. The only dissapoitment is regarding the interior design. The walls are pretty bare and there aren't any cool mexican decorations.  It looks more like a cafe than a full restaurant.  If they could get an interior designer in here to make it look more like Panchos or Lindo they would be golden.",

The color was too dark and the grains too big, but flavor ok. The service was great and the Manager personally visited twice. I really hope they tweak a few of these staple items and success",

Terribly strong fish taste that a ton of seasoning couldn't mask. I'm still trying to get the taste out of my mouth.  I don't know if it was an old piece of fish but it was really unenjoyable.

And for the price I was expecting more.   I had the chimichanga. It wasn't bad but it wasn't something I'd try again. It had nacho cheese over it which I thought was unique but it ended up just tasting like fast food.  It just seemed white washed Mexican and lackluster.

Margaritas were OKAY, could have been stronger but I left the last test up to how the food would taste.   When food came it was very hot and tasted amazing, UNTIL my mother pulled a long strand of hair out of her enchiladaWhat the hell!!! We called over the sever who I could tell was hesitant to approach without the manager, I could see them conversing behind my mom (which was also unprofessional). An older lady came from the kitchen and pointed at our table, I noticed she had on an hair net but it was half on covering her hair.   I signaled for the manager, she came over room the hair and the food and asked my mom if she wanted another one! HELL NO. After that it was no apologies and complete avoidance of the table. The didn't charge us for the meal but I would have liked more customer service and empathy! We were treated like we were the problem.   I have been wanting to eat here for a year and finally had the courage to try something new! FAIL I will stick to Lindo Michoacan in Henderson. They are the best thus far and have the best view on the city and drinks!   Too bad guys could of had a customer for life. I live down the street",

Tonight was our 4th visit and we are still impressed. Each time we've come we have had amazing food, fresh ingredients, large portions, friendly service, attentive staff and fast delivery. The restaurant itself is always clean, fun decor, great music and a comfortable atmosphere.   Tonight we had a genuinely happy waitress named Elizabeth who was pleasant and cheerful, just a pleasure. We assumed the man that came after her to make sure we were enjoying our meal was the manager, which we always love seeing management interacting with customers. He recognized my dish, Pollo Del Mar (outstanding by the way, I highly recommend) and said it was one of their signature dishes. He seemed proud of the product and I could see why.   5 stars all around; service, atmosphere, food, price point and portion... great restaurant, one of our favorites",

The server and busboy were friendly enough but they seemed overwhelmed. I ordered a glass of wine and it took about 10-15 minutes to come out. Once it came out there were chunks of cork in it so I sent it back. My second glass of wine didn't come out for at least 15 minutes after that... even our food was already out. I ordered a salad off the \"healthy\" menu ... but nothing on that menu is actually healthy. The salad was ok - ENORMOUS portion, like I could feed half of the restaurant with it. The chicken on the salad was kind of fatty :/ don't think I'd return...",

We were so impressed with this restaurant that we are looking forward to going back this Sunday for an all you can eat buffet brunch. The flan for dessert was smothered in caramel sauce and was juicy and delicious and just the right texture. This is truly my favorite Mexican restaurant!  Love this place. It was packed and I can see why.",

The food and service was great! We live near by and it was a perfect date night for me and my fiance. The flan was amazing but it could have had caramel sauce on top instead of honey. We will definitely be dinning out here again sometime.",

Our server approached our table in a timely manner. Received our drinks rather quickly along with chips and salsa. The salsa on the other hand was not good. Warm for some reason and the avocado salsa tasted as if it had too many preservatives..... I ordered the chicken chimichanga. Omg! It was supposed to have a chili con queso...no try government water down cheese sauce. The CHICKEN let me tell you it freaking tasted like it came outta a damn can like tuna! I couldn't do it. My boyfriend got the smothered burrito with beef. Holy bad news. That chilli sauce was no bueno. It tasted like sour tomatoes and they just threw chilli powder in it. I'm sorry but the only thing that was good was my margarita his Modelo and the service. The manager came by and touched our table to ask if she could get us anything else. She was very atentative and took care of our check minus our drinks. I'm sorry to say but we will not go back nor recommend to family or friends.",

I ordered the taquitos which were buried under a mountain of shredded lettuce, no sour cream and just two thin slices of avocado. Very dry. They make guacamole at your table for up charge but I would have been happy if they would have put some on my taquitos! The server was very attentive, no complaints there.

While not the greatest Tex-Mex, it is certainly not the worst (at least in Texas). We decided to try the new location off Arroyo Crossing. The restaurant is nice and clean and the service is fast. My wife and I had a sampler plate which contained fairly typical Tex-Mex offerings. Overall, we were quite disappointed. It has little resemblance to the restaurants in the same chain in Texas. The enchilada was without any flavor whatsoever. The refried beans had an unusual texture and taste and were somewhat overdone. The rice was anything but Tex-Mex. The beef fajita meat was actually pretty good. The tortillas were fair. The price though was considerably higher than the same restaurant plates in Texas. While we were hoping for a True Tex-Mex restaurant in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark. The lack of flavor and seasoning were disappointing-- akin to a Mexican TV dinner. Unfortunately, we will not try Los Cucos in Las Vegas again and continue to hope some True Tex-Mex restaurant eventually opens in Las Vegas.",

When we sat down at our table it took 10 mins for the waitress to come over for our drink order then another 10 for the girl to come and bring us some chips and salsa.  She brought us a basket of chip crumbs.   Once the waitress came back with our drink order I asked if we could bring us some chips so we could try the salsa.  She brought us more crumbs.  Disappointing!   You need to have chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant!!!  Ok now comes the food, there isn't much to select on the menu so I tried the cheese enchiladas.  You really can't mess that up!   Well they bring me something that looks like a corn tortilla topped with salsa.  It was so gross and the beans on the plate looked like they scraped a baby's diaper!    The only thing I could eat was the rice and that was not cooked all they way!   My friend did not complain too much about the Pollo Delmar, but wouldn't recommend it.  Very pricey for the meal.  Needless to say I was very disappointed and would not recommend this place.  The only reason I gave it a 1 cause you have to in order to write a review!!!   Save your money and cook at home!",

Eight days is how long I lasted in my 2018 NYE resolution.    Armando is our server.  Great guy who came here for the opening with his wife a year ago.  We started off with the Ceviche Cozumel - it's a bit spicy but filling. Armando recommended the Carne Margarita and the Seafood Al Vapor.  When the seafood came out, Armando cut the aluminum wrapping revealing a boiling cornucopia of seafood beneath.    The Carne Margarita was insanely delicious.  Resting on a bed of arroz was a tender fajita buried under a mound of mushrooms and herbs.  Somewhere in that bed of tasty was some Monterey Jack to really tie it together.  Ambiance was clean with Mexican music playing in the background that was neither overpowering conversation or loud.    I highly recommend this place and we will be back.  For brunch - they have a Sunday brunch that is only $16.99.  The ambiance is cozy and clean.",

The chicken fajita tacos are not what you thin, if you're want peppers and onions its not included, they're just flavored in fajita seasoning and smothered with queso... I was disappointed at first and then had one bite and was in love! The margaritas are definitely worth trying! They have a great happy hour and a friendly staff!

Or like grub hub... because it'll be really awkward if they realize how often I'm buying these ridiculously delicious hard shell beef tacos. I can't stop. I'm talking more than once a week people, and my whole family hasn't stopped me because literally everything from here is delicious so it's always a hit. It CAN get a little expensive if you get something other than tacos or burritos / chimichangas, but if you do get the aforementioned items, it's about $10 a person for a ton of really well seasoned, good quality food. I mean yeah I'm biased since it's like 1/7th of my diet but that's saying something because normally I don't go to many places more than once.",

We waited maybe 5 min or less and they accommodated us and we were 18 people deep!  The server Denis was quick to greet us and bring our drinks out. He took our orders and the food came out in no time. All of our food! Wow. No whining children asking us when the food was coming. I orders the shrimp poblano and it was yummy. It's a big meal.

Chips were obviously made way before they made their way to the table .  I ordered the flauta plate and my friend ordered the chicken enchiladas .  The flautas were over cooked mostly edible , lacked any real flavor . They are accompanied by ranchero beans . This was a version I had never seen. It was like soup and again lacking any flavor .   My friend's enchiladas were mild and okay. Not horrible , not great .  Will I visit again ? No . A person came by and asked how was our food and answered :good ? Right ?

I don't know about everyone else but first impressions mean a lot to me and that was a very nice one. And, it usually tells me everything I need to know about the restaurant but just in case...here's my review for the super burrito that I ordered to go...  First, the wait was not long at all, in spite of a very busy looking place. Sometimes the food can be prefect but if I'm waiting too long, it doesn't matter because my appetite gets upset and makes the perfect food taste bad. Oh, when I arrived, one of the servers was singing. That tells me he was happy and if a server is happy during a rush, then that's another sign of a good place to me. I kind of wish more servers sang while they worked. It seems to promote a good vibe and since restaurants are all about vibes, why not??   The portion size is huge.  Giant burrito.  Chips.  Salsa.  Beans and Rice. Chopped lettuce Guac and Sour Cream.   And, I'm not talking just a spoonful, you get a good bowl of rice and bowl of beans.  For under 15 bucks? That's plenty for one and maybe even enough to feed two.   The taste was delicious. Not over cooked. Not under cooked. Full of flavor stuffed all up inside like a pinata that exploded in my mouth when I took a bite.  Friendly. Fast. And flavorful.   Can yelp make a diamond review for those that exceed 5 star rating? Like hello?? Yelp...is anyone in there??  5 stars easy.",

    "text": "It was my first time ordering from this place. Our team at work decided to order dinner here and wanted to have it delivered. They use door dash as their delivery partner. Unfortunately, door dash didn't not have the dessert options on their ordering menu and we really wanted to try their Tres Leches, as it looked really good from the pictures here on Yelp. So we called the restaurant and asked how we can order it, they first said that we have to call door dash. I'm already unhappy with that answer. So I called again and asked if we can just order something that is the same price as the Tres Leches, and they can just make sure that we get the Tres Leches, the hostess passed the phone to someone else, not sure if she was a manager, and she again said that I have to call door dash, and I asked if we can just order something of the same price, and she finally said ok that is fine, just order something that costs $5.99 and place on the notes to substitute the Tres Leches. I was thankful. We went ahead and placed the order and made sure to place the notes and even noted that we have spoken to the restaurant already about it. About 5 minutes after we placed the order, I called again just to make sure that this is executed correctly. The first two calls went straight to voicemail as if they were purposely ignoring my call, then finally, on the third call, a guy answered, different from the girl who answered previously. His name was Allan or something like that. I kindly asked if they have received our order from door dash, he asked for the name, and he said \"yes, we did!\" I then asked him if they have the Tres Leches order as per requested and talked about, and he said \"Yes, we do have your Tres Leches in the order.\" This has made me happy and confident that my order will come correct as I have confirmed it.  And then the order arrives.... We opened it and the first thing we opened was a box that had coconut covered ice cream in it. At this point we already worried because we did not order any other desserts besides the Tres Leches. And we continued on with opening the rest of the orders, we opened another box which had brownies and churros, great desserts yes, but not something we ordered. Everything else in the bag was exactly what we ordered, EXCEPT there was NO Tres Leches. I am blown away and could not even fathom their thought process of how this happened. How they got everything correct, but the one thing I called for multiple times and had confirmed, was not in our order. But yet, they gave us all these desserts that we did not order. It's as if they did it in purpose.   IT IS NOT OK TO PLAY WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS. TERRIBLE SERVICE!",

In all actuality I think this restaurant deserves a 4 1/2 Star rating (I couldn't figure out how to do that). So what is my 1/2 star complaint? Well, I broke both legs a month ago and am wheelchair bound. Went to the restroom and the door is heavy. My husband had to push it open. That's it! My next visit will be on my own two legs.

While I am sad to see Mimi go, I am thrilled to have finally tried this restaurant. My family and I loved the salsa and the other green dip made up of sour cream, guacamole, and some other tasty ingredients. Lunch specials are awesome sauce! My hubby and I savored the shrimp quesadillas, my mom had chicken fajitas, my mother and father in law had chimichangas, and my kiddos had chicken quesadillas. The portions are generous and we highly enjoyed our meals. We sat in the enclosed outside area perfect if you have kiddos. The service was great too. Can't wait to go back. OLE!",

I ordered the chicken enchilada platter with a taco on side. The taco was so soggy it fell on the floor when I picked it up. The enchiladas were just ok.

Papasitos, Ninfas, and Los Cucos.  Out here in Vegas Los Cucos is the Holy Trinity.    The food is incredible.  You have to order their Beef fajitas. It is a Texas staple. You haven't lived until you've enjoyed a sizzling platter.  The service is wonderful. The on duty manager always makes his rounds to ensure your experience with the Texan way, great service and even better food.    Oh and prices are great. They are in line with what you get. Just a heads up...fajitas for one will feed about 2 people.",

When I showed them the coupon they said it was for brunch only. This makes zero sense because it says in fine print on the coupon it's for an entree of equal or lesser value and the brunch is a set price. The coupon says NO WHERE that it is for brunch only. They mention their brunch in the ad, but it is no where on the coupon. If they intended it to be for brunch only then they need to fire their designer or marketing person. They put out a coupon to get people in and then don't accept it?! Not a good business practice.  The menu was full of colorful Mexican food with some unique flavors that I hadn't seen before, but it was poorly organized and slightly overwhelming. Plus the food was priced too high for my liking.  The food was decent but the service was awful. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it took us like 20 minutes to get the check after we finished and no one cleared our plates.  I was really disappointed first by the coupon then by the service. I will not be going back.",

Where's the authentic deep fried tortilla chips???? Negative 5 points. The salsas were mediocre. I didn't taste the authenticity of the flavors.   Now, many will rant like crazy about me:\"you're Asian, what do you know about Mexican food?\" Let me tell you to--PAUSE, hold on to your tas-tas, and let me finish my review. When you grow up in TACO FLATS USA-California, your expectations are set high. Why? Because Juan, Jose & Maria's grandma used to do a lot of Latin foods. You definitely could even go to Sal's little taco stand and receive the best Buche taco and never looked at it any differently. Yes, be spontaneous and allow yourself to go balls deep into trying everything once.... enough said. Muchas Gracias!   Pros:  Great customer service  Big portions for what you pay for Open bar Family friendly  Clean  Cons:  Lack of authenticity in Latin flavors  Chips-cantina style Steak over cooked (ordered med. rare) Salsas lacked flavor  #chipotlebeatsLosCucos worst part..... I HATE CHIPOTLE FRANCHISE.... I am all about small joint places and support local businesses!   So, I warned you.   You're welcome.",

This restaurant was located in the back of the parking lot but we spotted it as we were leaving ROSS. I'm not one to try new restaurants without doing my research first but this place was AMAZING! Best decision of the day. The staff was very welcoming, big smiles. The drink selection was amazing. The Menu had A LOT of options and the prices were very good. The atmosphere of the restaurant overall was very clean, bright, and beautiful colors, the lighting, music, and entertainment (tvs) were all very on point. Our waitress was the sweetest and helped us choose what to order. The FOOD let me tell you was probably the best Mexican food I've ever had at a restaurant, I've had real traditional homemade Mexican food before and going to Mexican restaurants in America is always a gamble to see how good it is. This place hands down was just AMAZING! AMAZING SERVICE, FOOD, EVERYTHING!!!!! Highly Recommended!!!",

Our server took 15 minutes to greet us and was not very helpful when it came time to explaining the differences in the margaritas.  I loved the colored pictures on the menu, if only our actual food reflected them though.  My fajita meat was 2-3 inches thick and did not have the flavor or texture of the meat I'm used to being served on a sizzling platter. And no, for the record,  there was no sizzle here, folks.  I think the highlights were my watermelon margarita and their Birthday song for our daughter.  We quickly figured when you hear the bell ring, someone, somewhere is about to be sung to.

I have had the shrimp quesadillas and the Del Mar and both are excellent meals.",

The chips are stale and the red salsa must have came out of the microwave or something because the temperature was hot as I am not talking about how spicy it is. A avocado salsa tastes like who knows what but it was no good. Chipotle and QDOBA grill are much better choices in the area if you have a hankering for Mexican.",

To start they give you generous portions of chips and their two salsas which I've found not so common since moving here. Menu prices are a bit high but the potion sizes are reflective (we ended up with a box to take home). The restaurant was clean. Food took a good while to come out but the servers were attentive and took notice when it seemed to be taking too long. Steak for fajitas was well seasoned. And tamales weren't dry at all. Beans had great flavor. Even my kids' meals were delicious when I sampled them and the portions were very generous.",

I know the difference between exceptional service and unacceptable. I rarely give reviews or ask to speak to a manager since I hardly get wowed.   Last night I got wowed, our server Victor did an exceptional job from greeting, following up after a couple bites, suggestive selling us a dessert.. all with a smile. Great kid  The food was very good, packed with flavor. I suggest the Mexican Bowl and my fiance was very pleased with her enchiladas..which she ate the leftovers this afternoon and still delicious.  For those of you that review restaurants, spend some time in a kitchen or work the floor to give your review any sort of merit.   We've all had out bad nights, speak with the manager first before you bash them on social media or yelp. Give them the opportunity to fix it, then again we live in a passive aggressive society. If you don't have the guts to speak to a manager, send them an email.   Base your decision if they respond or not.",

The price kinda took my breath away at first but we were all seated and I didnt want to be \"that\" person who snuck out the door, but let me tell you... it was worth it.

My husband ordered El Gringo which comes with rice, beans, salad, enchelada, tacos, fajita beef with fresh flour tortilla.  Both of our meats were tasty and have a lot of flavors. The only thing negative I can say is that the fresh flour tortilla gets hard so fast and my husband says that his beef was a little dry other than that It was great. I recommend all of you to try it.

The service was great, waiters and waitresses were very friendly however the food left much to be desired. Coming from a Latino family I have high expectations for Mexican/Latino establishments and I would rate this place on the same level as Taco Bell. The refried beans definitely came from a can, had the consistency of cement and had no flavor whatsoever, not even any cheese and the rice was severely dry and under-seasoned. The dishes that were supposed to have cheese in them either had no cheese or were smothered velveeta, GROSS. All food the food was bland and to be quite honest, all 7 in attendance for dinner there last night feel sick afterwards. The prices are too high for what you actually get, all in all, super disappointed",

The service is okay, mainly because our second time there it seemed the server was super new and things did not come out as expected, but the manager jumped in and made it all good. They have a mariachi band that goes around. The first time we went we sat out of the glassed in patio. It was a really cool space.

The fajitas are tender, hot, and juicy just like I remember them.  The tortillas are hot, fluffy, and fresh.  The salsa is served hot, not cold like the typical restaurants in the desert.  The stuffed avocado is decadent!  The margaritas are the best into town!  Order a frozen with a Chambord shot...you won't be disappointed.   The management and staff are the best.   The manager, Jesus, makes you feel welcome like you're at a family gathering on Christmas holiday.  Bottom line, I've been dreaming that this day would come.  It finally has!  Give this place a try.

Our waiter Jose was spot on; food was timely and seating was timely.  ***UPDATE*** So I've gone back now for a third time and have had a different meal every time. They have all been fantastic!  I can not get enough of the food here, it's awesome. They also have a side of pickled carrots and jalapenos, I have to have them--they are a perfect fit with every meal--I crave them. We have never had a bad meal and the service is top notch. We've never waited more than 3 mins for a table and the wait staff is on time and courteous all the time. Even if you don't make this your regular place at least check it out once--you'll be back!",

The waiters are always so nice and have a smile and if they end up messing up on accident totally understandable they offer to remake the food and pay for it which is the kindest thing. In conclusion Los Cucos Mexican Cafe in my opinion is my favorite Mexican place to go to which says a lot.",

You get seated promptly and warm chips and 2 salsas are dropped at your table. They are amazing. Our favorite is the creamy avocado. The waiters are all excellent. The managers come to check on your table and it's nice to chat with them a few minutes. We always feel so at home here. The menu is large and there is something for everyone, even the kids menu is great! Our favorite is the Fish Cancun but the mixed chicken/steak fajita poblano is really good too!!  Dessert doesn't disappoint. Light scones dusted in cinnamon sugar and a bowl of ice cream to dip them in is the perfect ending. We will be here again and again! My advice to you is Just go..you won't regret it!!!",

We ordered the fajitas which the chicken and shrimp were tasty... but little disappointed with the number of tortillas... only 2 per person for the fajitas for 2. Sour cream should be a normal side for fajitas and when I ordered the sour cream... I was not informed that it was almost a $2 upcharge until I got the bill. So therefore, I probably would of been charged for the tortillas had I asked for them.  Service was fine except we weren't asked if we wanted more chips. Only had 1 basket.

My buddies who live there sit at the bar once a week and I've gone several times and things were fine. We went Thursday June 6 around 7pm and sat at the bar. There were 3 other ppl for the bartender to take care of but it took her 8-10 minutes to greet us and bring us chips & Salsa (which was hot) and take our drink order.     I ordered the El Gringo and told her NO RABBIT FOOD no lettuce or tomatoes anywhere on the plate. She didn't write our order down so I don't know if it was her or the kitchen but when she brought it it had lettuce and tomatoes all over.    I pointed it out and expected her to use her brain and just go get me a different taco but before I knew it she'd picked up my plate and was gone.   5 minutes later I get my plate back and my fajitas and enchiladas are now cold and the taco has been scraped of everything including the cheese which I wanted.  I asked her to bring me some chz and she acts like I asked for her kidney. She's the one incompetent at her job and now I'm getting attitude and crappy cold food.  I end up paying $63 for a horrible night out plus I left her a tip which I regret doing but I'm too nice. I was up all night sick as well but I don't know if it was the food or not. Needless to say I can't imagine going back to this place. If my friends rlly want to eat there I'll just eat prior and have a margarita which was the only decent part of the meal.   I don't recommend this place at all!!",

This kind makes me weary when a restaurant does that, but over all the food was decent. I ordered the grilled chicken quesadillas with black beans. The presentation was a little messy, but overall the taste was good. I also ordered the gold strawberry margarita, that was very good. Not to sweet and just the right amount of tequila.

The food was just okay this time but not as good as our other visits so I'm updating my review. Also since we had a child with us, he was served uncooked French fries with his quesadilla. This was not only gross and unacceptable, I was disturbed that a kitchen would send this out.  Also, since we went around lunch time and was a party of 5, we ended up sitting in a walkway near the kitchen. This makes the experience less enjoyable in my opinion. There were many other places we could have been seated.  I'm not sure when we will be taking the trip to try Los Cucos again after this experience or recommending it with all the other Mexican food options in Vegas.",

I then head to bar to get a drink; bartender talking to another employee as she sees me waiting. Walks over only after a waiter needs assistance; then after she helps him acknowledged me. Less than 5 mins so I'm thinking ok; maybe her CS skills aren't that great hopefully the food is better. They sit two more tables and takes their order before ours; assuming our table is waiting for another person since I was at the bar. Waiter argues saying we didn't say anything and thought we were waiting for one more person; instead of asking us. Ask to speak to manager and she says it was probably \"confusion\". Communication is key when dealing with the public. Why would you not acknowledge us and inquire instead of assuming and helping others who came in after. At first I thought the hosts and bartender may need a little CS training but it seems as if their entire staff needs CS training from host - bartender- waiter and manager; they seem to be confused and not the customers.  It's unfortunate because we only got to taste their chips which was ok so I can review their food. We walked out and it didn't seem as if they cared.",

We made it in time for happy hour, on taco Tuesday and the house margaritas were so cheap!  This time we ordered the stuffed avocado with shrimp as our appetizer, which was perfectly crisped. And the avocado on the inside wasn't warm (I dislike warm avocados). Once again we ordered the shrimp poblano and fajitas a la poblano as our enteee. Both so delicious! We both agreed that the shrimp poblano was better than the previous times.   The service was great! Our server, Antonio, made sure our waters were always full to the brim and never empty. Very attentive and helpful! The manager came out twice, making sure we were taken care of and making sure everything was good! Very much appreciated!!  Music is always on point here.   Highly recommended :)",

    "text": "I wanted somewhere to stop for dinner on the way home from UNLV and I chose Los Cucos from a search on Yelp.  The restaurant was busy, but I was seated promptly.  A server came and asked about drinks and I ordered my standard iced tea.   I was intrigued by their deep fried stuffed avocado and I decided to try that.  It's a large platter of food.  While waiting for dinner, I enjoyed the chips and salsas.  The tomato based salsa is warm when served and has a small tang to it.  The other is totally different.  It's sour cream, avocado, cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic.  It's quite different and it was good.    After a longer wait than I expected, my meal was brought.  The food was mostly lukewarm.  Since the tortilla soup--also lukewarm-- is served as part of the dinner platter, the food has more chance to lose temperature as you eat the soup.  I'd much rather have the soup served hot as a separate starter than have it lumped on a plate with my main meal.  The stuffed avocado was very good.  The chicken inside had a good flavor and the breading on the avocado was fairly light and crunchy.  The rest of the dish was below average.  The refried beans were very dry, and the fajita taco was covered with chile con queso that tasted like it was melted Cheez Whiz.    Service was lacking.  I asked my server for some sweetener.  He evidently forgot.  After trying to get his attention for about 5 minutes, I asked one of the bus people and I got the sweetener.  Another bus person refilled my iced tea the first time.  My server just walked by.  Later, he put a number of small napkins on the table.  I really have no reason for doing so as they have cloth napkins.  I'd rather have drink refills and sweetener than a number of cocktail sized napkins.  The best part of the meal was dessert.  The tres leches cake was excellent!  It's disheartening when you leave a restaurant thinking of just one course and dismissing the rest.  There will not be a return visit.",

They were very greasy. My husband had to ask for his drink twice, and it never got refilled. My daughter also accidentally spilled her drink. The server saw it, and walked away. I assumed for a rag/towel/mop/napkins, but no. He never even acknowledged it all. We cleaned it up the best we could with cloth napkins (which are nowhere near absorbent).  I will definitely go back, I love the food (except the queso) and I always have a great experience, but I'll make sure I don't have this server next time.",

What a mistake!  I ordered takeout chicken & beef fajitas for two.  As soon as i opened the box, i knew it was going in the garbage.  The chicken was cut into big chunky strips, looked like it was boiled and had zero flavor or color. Not to mention it was super dry.  The beef was ok, but definitely wouldn't order it again.  No peppers, only onions.   $40 later, myself & my 2 yr old twins ate the tortilla chips for dinner. My mom had a couple bites and my husband passed altogether.  If the rest of their food is this bad, i honestly don't know how they stay in business.  Big pass",

We weren't sure what to expect but were pleasantly surprised! Very clean, great service, and delicious food. It's a very diverse menu with things we had never heard of! The start by bringing 2 types of salsa, my favorite was the avocado salsa. Creamy and refreshing! We also got a chili cob queso appetizer that comes with warmed, fried pita chips. Delcious! 2 of us got the chicken stuffed avocado which was so different than anything we have had before! It comes with a small cup of chicken tortilla soup which was TO DIE FOR. The other two with us got chimichangas and liked those as well. Even the rice and beans that come with each meal were something special, not like the typical canned refried beans you get at most Mexican restaurants. Highly recommend!!!",

The bar service has been very poor the last two times I've come in. The previous time I sat on the right side of the bar on a week night and although the bar was not full, I was completely ignored and had to flag the bartender down several times to be helped. On my latest visit, I sat near the well hoping to get better service. I was acknowledged this time because my location demanded it but the service was still poor. I ordered from the menu for my to go ordered and had a margarita while I waited. About 25 minutes later, I was still waiting for my food so I asked for the bill so that I could leave as soon as my food was ready. I noticed one of the menu items on the bill was less expensive than it was on the menu so I mentioned it to the bartender. She was unaware of a menu item and proceeded to tell me they didn't have what I was asking for. I told her that I was sure they did because I had pointed to it when I ordered. I showed her on the menu and she told me they didn't have that so I said \"so is the menu wrong?\" She said she'd get a manager, another server came by and confirmed my suspicion, that they did in fact have what I ordered. He went to the kitchen to have it corrected. The bartender made no apologies. She could tell I was frustrated but just ran my card. I get it, servers/bartenders make mistakes, I've served myself so I understand. Apologize, smile and fix your mistake that's the best way to save the interaction. Better yet, be friendly and attentive to every customer and then if and when a mistake happens, your patrons will be more patient and understanding. I want to like this place because the food is good but I can't justify coming back if the service is disappointing.",

I have eaten at their Katy Tx. location several times and am a huge fan. For months I anxiously waited for them to open, telling all of my friends how amazing it was compared to all of the other Mexican places here. I have eaten there 4 times since they have opened, each time with a different person and every time they tell me how right I was.  On each occasion I've ordered different things and each time they come out fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned. The warm chips and red and green salsas are so delicious and truly addicting. The queso with beef fajita meat makes you want to lick the bowl. They have great lunch specials with huge portions and the stuffed avocado is sublime. They have a great chicken dish that is covered in a mushroom wine sauce that will make you dream about the next time you can get there to have it again. Everyone I bring here can't get over how awesome the fajita meat is. It's so tender and seasoned to perfection. I know some people are not fans of Tex- Mex and that's okay you can keep your Lindo and  Leticias, all of my friends and I will be at Los Cucos!",

The seafood cocktail sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce w/ a weird red oily sauce on top, not really feeling it.  The shrimp fajitas were ok but had too much of a spicy tomato based sauce going on, thank goodness for the side of guacamole to help mask the flavor.  The worst was the rice and beans that come w/ the fajitas, just terrible.  The rice literally tasted like instant rice, like Spanish Rice-a-Roni or Knorr.  The rice was too dry and the flavor just wasn't there for the rice or the beans.  My son ordered the cheeseburger on the kid's menu and part of his bun came out really hard, kinda like when you try & microwave a frozen piece of bread for too long.  I know its a Mexican restaurant so I should of known better than to order him a cheeseburger but he's 4 and was dead set on getting a burger.  Our bill was just under $80 (including drinks & tip).

Los Cucos is from Houston (I believe as they are all over town).  FINALLY I can get a real fajita in LV.  In Houston I would rate Los Cucos as a slightly above average Tex Mex but I am so happy to have it in LV and being it is the only one here I give it 5 stars!  THe service is excellent and the restaurant is exceptionally clean (it is brand new). They have a Sunday brunch that is pretty good. I love their chips and green salsa and the Fajitas are amazing. Don't go here looking for northern Mexican style food (Michoacan ) like u get everywhere else in town- THIS IS TRUE TEX MEX",

We both each had a margarita at half price and I will say the margarita was pretty good, not the greatest but very good. The food was excellent! I had the fajitas a la poblana and it was amazing. Incredible flavor, and the steak was awesome. It was cool to have some authentic mariachi music by their live band but it was pretty loud so it was hard to talk to people at the table. The service was excellent everyone checks up on you including the manager multiple times. My only complaint was when we got change for a bill that we paid for with cash, the server only gave me change to either give him a $2 tip or a $20 for a $50 bill. I don't mind giving 20 or even 25% tip but when you're trying to force me to give you a 40% tip, that doesn't fly too well with me. Lucky for him we were in a good mood so I got change from the bar to give him a good tip but do not try and force me to tip you nearly half the price of my bill unless you want me to only give you the $2 change that I had left. Other than that it would be a 5 star review.",

The hostess greeted us with a big simile and seated us at the patio, which is enclosed so it made it even better since it was a bit chilly outside. The restaurant had a clean and rustic Mexican theme decor and Obeisance to it. The waitress Adriana and Maria where both very sweet and additive to our table. The manager came over and introduced him self and asked if everything was good, of course it was and invited us to their grand opening on Friday Jan 6, 2017. I had the fish  tacos,it was absolutely delicious, with fresh Hand made tortillas and tomatillos cream sauce, and grill fish. It also came with fresh bean stew and white rice with some carrots and green onions in it. My husband had the rib eye steak dinner he really enjoyed his dish. Cooked perfect. The staff was all friendly and kind. Our water and soft drinks never went empty, top notch service.",

I couldn't help but to leave a awesome review on this place. Jesus the manager welcomed us in, and sat us as we were the first ones to arrive. The drinks he made us at the bar, wow  the best Michelada I've had here in Vegas. My girlfriend ordered a spicy Bloody Mary, and she was amazed on how well it came out. Being impressed by the quality drinks we have been served, it gets better the food we ordered. Words can't even explain the thought process, that was put into the food dishes we were served. The quality of food just amazing. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality food and great drinks. I am in the service industry myself, and I always say quality doesn't have a price tag. So if you're looking for a great experience, then this is the place you wanna be. After we paid our bill, Jesus checked on us as we were checking out. He then had mention, they were having a Sunday brunch that started at 9:30am. He invited us back to join them. We definitely will take them up on that invite and make sure to bring our family and friends back with us. Thanks for your awesome service Jesus and staff. Everyone was awesome  -Bill",

    "text": "My Yelp app said this place received  3.5 stars, so I was curious...    How it ever received 3.5 stars is beyond me...  This was my first time there and I will NEVER go back.  They were not horribly busy, so I went in and sat at the bar.  The bartender greeted me quickly and asked if id like a drink and a menu..  I ordered a drink, she brought it, then I ordered something off the lunch menu.  They brought the usual chips and salsa.  Warm Salsa????  I thought it was strange to have the salsa be warm, but I tried it anyway...it was somewhat tasteless, so I switched to the next dip.. this was better than the first but still lacked something.  I was only 5 chips in and scooped what looked like a hair out of the 2nd dip...  I looked around to see if the bartender would look at it but she completely disappeared. I told myself I could be wrong... I wanted to believe I was wrong...  My first mistake was not leaving right then and there.. After 20 minutes the bartender reappeared with my food.  She warned me the plate was hot, but what she should have said was the plate is hot but the food is NOT..  I ordered the lunch taco plate..  The menu read 1 flour tortilla taco, served with pico, etc..  a bowl of tortilla soup, rice & beans. (the beans had cheese on them in the picture)..  I tried to eat the soup, but quickly discovered I had to use my knife to cut the completely oversized, undone vegetables in the bowl. After 3 bites I gave up and slid that aside.  I moved on to the beans, which was cold, tasted sour and had no cheese on them it all. I slid that aside as well...At this point I'm famished, so instead of leaving, I proceeded to try the taco.. . I realized there was no pico or cheese on the little side plate they brought.  I ended up with lettuce and 2 slices of avocado. I look up to find again the bartender/waitress disappeared. I can't even ask for any.. I opened the tortilla to discover dried up steak...  That was it... I pushed that aside and waited for the bartender to get back...  so she comes back and ask if I needed anything else.. I looked down at the plate, then back up to her and said \"just a check\"   She looked at my plate turned around and proceeded to bring me the check and asked if I wanted a box..  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  In what world would someone not ask if there was a problem with the food, especially if you seen your customer barely touched the food.  That was my breaking point... I asked for the manager and low and behold he finally appears 10 minutes later...  I communicated what I experienced, explained the food was inedible, told him I was going to pay the check, leave and never return.  He half acted like he was concerned, offered to get the check only once, then proceeded to clear my plate and walked away.. He should have  insisted and tore the check up....  WOW..... the restaurant industry is so competitive, especially here. even more so with the ability to post.  The owner would be saving himself a lot of bad reviews if he took action right away.... If I owned that place, the cook, waitress and manager would be gone today.....     I've had better service and food from Del Taco.... UGH!!!",

    "text": "I ordered through Grubhub so I cannot say if that's the reason for my experience but I don't think so. I placed my order at 7:02 and my delivery window was 7:35-7:45. After hitting submit the delivery time changed to 8:11-8:22 which admittedly could have been because I was ordering for a family of 6. I watched my order the whole time and the delivery driver was on point, once the order said the food was ready for pickup the driver was there and headed to my house so I can only assume the reason for my experience was the restaurant.  I ordered 3 chicken taco meals and the chicken was in huge chunks, not what I was expecting. The taco \"shells\" were hardly shells when delivered and were so soggy  nothing would even stay in them to take a bite. My kids had to just toss the shells and eat the chunks of chicken by themselves.  We ordered 2 super burrito meals and they were just ok, nothing to write home about. I was pleasantly surprised they gave you bags of chips, salsa and guacamole with every meal but the chips were overcooked and not very good anyways. Overall for the $93 it cost to feed my family we will not be ordering from here again.",

Unfortunately the food was not the greatest. 30% of food ordered was good but consistency was not there. We were stoked to have handmade tortillas until most of them were still slightly raw.  Tacos had too much fat, if you like that then great. But not our cup of tea. Flan tasted more like cheesecake. Only thing that made our visit great was the fact that a lady who seemed to be the owner walked to all tables and wanted to hear customers feedback. She asked we told,  and she said usually because people want their food right away. We gave her our constructive feedback and said we would rather wait 5 more minutes to have better consistency and not something that seemed made in a rush without care.  She was so appreciative, thanked us and seemed to take it well.  Things we actually liked:  The red enchilada had great flavor though. The salsa for the chips were great, especially the avocado cream dip.",

For anyone looking for a genuine Mexican meal this is not the place to come. To tell you that they don't even offer aguas frescas. We waited 30 minutes for our appetizer to come and 50 minutes for our food!! There was a fan right above our table set on high speed. We asked our waitress if they can turn it down because it was blowing so hard even the signs on the tables were moving.  She said she had to ask the manager and it took them and hour to turn off the fan. The manager was  waking around making sure customers were happy with their service, but didn't even stop by our table to make sure we were. The food was bland. Not very tasty.

Los Cucos is so fresh, and some of the best chicken fajitas I have ever had! Service was good...I LOVE their warm red salsa and the green salsa. So delicious. The chicken fajitas are amazing and fresh. It's more like fresh tex-mex style cuisine, not really like California hearty Mexican food. I live in Henderson, but I definitely will be back when I am in the area!",

Here's how I see it... AMAZING!!   authentic to region  superbly prepared quality food  knowledgeable/fun wait staff  bright clean understated atmosphere  a bar that can keep you happy with your selection-- very happy prices are fair especially for what you get  management who cares a family business making it and expanding   In short - - My drink brought many smiles to my face. The chips were free and the salsas were addicting. The shrimp were huge and tasted like they had just been pulled out of the Gulf of Mexico.  I even loved the rice and I usually never touch it cuz to me it's wasted calories.  And, we could have afforded ice cream on the way home but we were too full!!

When we arrived we were greeted by traditional dressed lady who escorted us to our table. There is Selena Music playing the entire time! Omg, Selena is big and I'm very impressed how this restaurant embraces Selena music. Anyways, the food was amazing! You have to try the queso fundido, it's to die for, im coming back just for this. I ordered the healthy bowl and it was absolutely amazing and healthy. My sister ordered the fajitas style platter and it was tender meat with so many flavors. Try this place, it's a must and the first one in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Finally tried this place after waiting way too long. Living in the Southwest we have a few favorite Mexican eateries that we frequent: Juan's Flaming Fajitas, Pinches Tacos, Chile Verde and Frijoles & Frescas. But it was time to try a new place and I'm so glad I insisted we did! My husband is always hesitant to try a new place...we value consistency and those restaurants I listed always provide us with an excellent meal and excellent service. So it's hard to breakaway and try something new. I literally can not wait to go back Los Cucos!  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be good because the salsas they brought with the chips were delicious! And my margarita was perfect! My husband ordered a  combination plate, a three cheese enchilada, a chicken enchilada and 2 chicken taquitos. He loved his meal, would have preferred the chicken been shredded or pulled rather than in chunks but still thought it was excellent. I ordered a mixed plate called el sabroso with a beef taco al carbon...the most tender and melt in your mouth beef I've ever had! It also came with a three cheese enchilada and the most delicious carnitas that fell apart with the slightest touch of a fork served with tortillas and the most incredible tomatillo sauce that I added to everything on my plate because it was just that good. I loved it all!  And even though I want to try other items on the menu, I can't imagine not ordering this again!  Since this was our first time here, all I can hope for is consistency. I'd be so disappointed if our next visit was less than amazing.",

    "text": "I've only done the Sunday brunch so I haven't done their normal dinner or lunch. It is PHENOMENAL!  First, the employees running the food are dressed in traditional Mexican clothing. The girls wearing the big colorful skirts. So beautiful. The brunch is buffet style which at first made me kinda ehh as buffets tend to suck unless they're the top ones on the strip. I was entirely wrong.   The options are PLENTY but also not overwhelming. It feels like they would rather offer a decent choice of options and serve them up with quality and care instead of dumping 100 half asses options for the sake of saying they have 100 options.   You can find surprisingly fresh ceviches and aguachiles, I believe posole, a made to order taco stand, tamales, made to order chilaquiles (which is amazing as chilaquiles tend to get soggy so making them made to order is genius). Even for vegetarians this place is great and you'll find potato taquitos, cheese filled chile rellenos, nopales and other vegetarian options if that's what you seek.  They also offer regular soft drinks through the server or you can head over to the aguas naturales station. They had like 3 or 4 options when I went: watermelon, melon, and I forgot what else.   The dessert table is about equal Mexican desserts and regular American desserts. Conchas, pan dulce, Gansitos, then stuff like donuts, chocolate cakes, and a fondue station.   Service is amazing. Cleanliness is amazing. Food is amazing. I don't get how I hadn't heard of this place before. 5 stars well deserved!",

    "text": "4.5 stars, indeed!  It takes me a lot to admit things like this, but DIZZAMM! This place was off the HOOK; slamming, crackin', just the right type of food I needed--whatever you want to call it, it was GUD'! One of the many Mexican restaurants that I have eaten at and can say I honestly enjoyed my meal!  Be advised that the menu is extremely daunting, it would be a great idea to already have an idea of what you want beforehand.  Goodness, gracious!  During my recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I decided to go for Mexican food off the strip for dinner and I am SO excited we did. Los Cucos is known for their SEXY drinks, I mean, if I didn't know any better, I would have walked out of their a certified drunk!  Moving on, shall we...  Upon walking in, we were seated rather quickly. We were given menus and asked if we wanted to start with any drinks. I opted to order the sexy margarita as my friends ordered the sexy drinks that looked dangerous! :: Emoji Heart Eyes::  As I received my drink, our table also received complimentary chips and salsa which were delicious and tasty for a snack. If you get the salsa, make sure to order the green salsa as it was a nice compliment to the chips and was the BEST I've ever tasted in my 28 years of living; GOODNESS! With two young children and 3 adults, I must admit that our server did a wonderful job making sure we were well taken care of. Our table ordered a little bit of everything, I went for the Crab enchiladas with double rice. My food was everything I asked for and MORE; very flavorful and left me satisfied, indeed. Admittedly, the portions are very huge, enough for me to food to go for the next day. The waitstaff was very attentive and was readily available every time our water glasses got low.  They have a wonderful happy hour that is only eligible if you are sitting at the bar. Alas, we were not able to receive the happy hour as we had two young kids with us. I would have loved to see Happy Hour be available inside the whole restaurant no matter where you sit.  It would be truly a five-star restaurant if there was some music while we ate and have several drinks--just sayin'!  I love a server that uses the phrase, \"Is everything okay\" continuously when checking in. It shows that they care and want to make sure you have a good visit, and that's exactly what we did!  There is no doubt that I'll be back!",

I had high expectations for this place because my friends had hyped it up for me. Also there's a lack of good authentic Mexican food in the southwest Vegas area. So, I was excited and ready to try this spread of food.  The buffet met allll my expectations. They had freshly made carnitas, al pastor, and chicken tacos. I was told their barbacoa was the best but they didn't have it on the day. This only means that another trip here is in order. I am not mad bout that. They had all the basics of what you would expect at a Mexican buffet like enchiladas, sopes, menudo, chorizo & eggs, random meats etc. The ceviche was unexpected and for a buffet amazingly delicious! They had 3 different kinds -- shrimp, crab, and some sort of fish. I didn't expect it to be fresh but it sure was.  I really loved the champurrado, the Mexican coffee, and the strawberry milk. Such a good cap to my already delicious meal!!!   The whole meal with tax and tips were about $25. Good value, good quality food, good location. I will be back soon :)",

The food was amazing! Everything, including the salsas for the complimentary chips, had such great flavors!  My only issue was that on my \"healthy\" quesadilla, the menu indicated it was all vegetables and chicken with \"light cheese.\"  However, it came out with copious amounts of cheese. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cheese, and it was delicious! But I was trying to get a healthier option on this occasion, and it didn't quite hit the mark on that.

Everyone was so helpful and the service was top notch. You can tell they care for their guests.   I've had tacos here once before and I was in love. Delicious! The meats were so flavorful! This last visit, we went and grabbed a grill special. We ordered the Parrilla San Luis for two people. That was about $48. A lot of food! Came with shrimp, carnitas, chicken, chicken quesadilla, and jalapeno sausage. Came in sizzling!  All meats were tender and flavorful. Cooked to perfection. The sausage was def a but spicy but nothing I couldnt handle. We also got a plate each with rice, beans, greens, a bit of guacamole, pico de gallo and some tortillas. It was a great amount of food that we could not finish! No room for dessert.   We admit, we werent fans of the salsa. Seemed watered down and we had to ask for hotter salsa. Our waitress did not disappoint and came through with something hotter. So, we were really happy with that!   The restaurant was bright in color but still comfortable. Waitresses were all dressed up all gorgeous. There was a birthday going on in the other room and the staff went over and sang their hearts out. It was cute. lol.   Would definitely come back here for sure. Try something else next time. :D",

Compared to other Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, this is one of the worst that I have been to. The service was actually OK. We had no issues with that. The menu is chock-full of chicken. If you are a vegetarian, this is not a restaurant for you. There was only one clear vegetarian meal which was the spinach enchiladas in the whole wheat tortilla wraps with cheese. I ordered their ceviche and it is one of the worst I've ever had. What was really strange is that they had actual ceviche and then they had boiled shrimp next to it. It was very odd and the taste was just OK. Their refried beans tasted like it had a lot of cumin spice in it so it wasn't very good. The Margarita was OK but I've had way better. The prices are reasonable but the food is just mediocre at best. I would not come back here again. Total disappointment.",

We complained and the manager gave a Modelo bottle to pour in a glass and a new margarita after it was returned it still didn't taste like a margarita .. tasted more like flavored water. I don't think they even tried to make me a new one. So disappointed !! ...for that reason I will not go back. I was so happy to have a nearby Mexican restaurant we can go to and that served great drinks... but not anymore.  I felt so ripped off by this place on top of it all.",

HOWEVER Los Cucos surpassed my expectations! Coming from Los Angeles my first though driving to the restaurant was the longgggg wait we would encounter as ALL restaurants in LA you have a minimum of an hour wait on Sundays. This was not the case here; we arrived and got seated that same moment.  Food selection for the brunch was small but you had your variety. There is an egg and omelet station to the left of the food area for the brunch. Down the middle you have your Sea food, Fruit and Mexican dishes selection. And to the far end you have your taco station. They also have an Aguas Frescas station (natural fruit juice) they have a coffee station that includes champurrado (corn dough chocolate Mexican atole) and hot chocolate. You also have your dessert table with a variety of Mexican sweet bread and cakes. There is cereal and milk also included in the dessert table.  Food selection was great! There was Chiles Rellenos, Carne en su Jugo, Shrimp in pasta, Rice, Beans, enchiladas, sopes, quesadillas, menudo and so much more.   Food is good, service is good.  I would say definitely a place to try. I'm looking forward to visit my sisters again to have brunch here.",

    "text": "First, this is NOT a Mexican restaurant. Second, it is not Tex-Mex. It is their own version of what that means. Having had friends from Mexico (Chihuahua) who owned a Mexican restaurant, this food is not consistent with my normal experience with Mexican food in the USA or Mexico.  For example the red sauce has ground BEEF in it. If I order a Chicken product, I really do NOT want beef on it. They call this red sauce their 'gravy.' I asked for just a plain red sauce instead, expecting a red taco sauce, and what they put on the food was not a red chili sauce, it was more orange and not spicy or flavorful in anyway.  The chicken was not breast meat. It was the cheaper thigh and leg dark meat. They have Filet Minion on the menu, but they give you cheap chicken parts for the chicken meals.  You could order the shredded chicken. A fellow dinner did order that and it was just a plain shredded chicken breast. No spicing, no flavoring.  They do not have normal salsa. They give you a HEATED spicy/flavorful/red dipping sauce. As well they have a guacamole/green/creamy dipping sauce as well. It was tasty but not anything I had seen before.  If you object to garlic, beware. It is in EVERYTHING. I consider garlic a cheap flavor enhancer. Restaurants that rely on it for the flavor rate LOW in my opinion. With all the REAL spices and flavors, don't cheap out with garlic.  I was excited to see a new restaurant open in this location, but sadly, it is not my style. I wish I had known this before having my Birthday dinner there. It kind of ruined it for me.",

The complimentary chips and salsa is a plus but the thing that I enjoyed the most was actually the desserts! We ordered a tres leches cake and a cheesecake. To our surprise they also brought out another dessert, complimentary for his bday, called a sopapillas? Haven't had it before but it's pretty much another version of a churro except in a triangular donut form. It was soooooo good. Probably the best tres leches cake I've ever had. The staff was super friendly and very nice. I would definitely go back again with the rest of my family to try out.",

Ordered chimichanga & beef fajita stuffed avocado.  Chimichanga came smothered in what can best be described as watered down canned Campbell's nacho cheese soup. Refried beans also appeared to be canned as they turned white as they sat on the plate. Stuffed avocado was crunchy and hard with chewy cheese inside. Tortilla soup was basic vegetable soup with tortilla strips & covered with a thick layer of onion soup cheese. Bland seems to be the going word here. Even the asked for Tapatio bottled sauce was bland. No spices. No jalapenos. Nothing TexMex about this place. Honestly this is what I would picture TexMex food would be like at either an Iowa preschool or senior center (where people require bland diets). Listening to other tables we heard \"odd, strange and this is horrible\" by people describing their meals and drinks. Sorry, won't be back.",

I ordered no avocado on my tacos as my only request, and it came with it anyway.

First there was sticky food leftover on my wife's seat that hadn't been cleaned.The the service sucked, no straws no silverware, no napkins to start. Never refilled the waters, never returned so I could order a second beer. Food was garbage. My wife ordered a Chimichanga, the meat was sub-par and greasy. It was covered in Cheese that tasted like rotten milk. I ordered a combo plate, taco was very greasy, cheese enchilada was burnt, refried beans looked like they were dry and roasted under a heating lamp for 20 minutes.  The only bright spot was my wife's Pina Colada. Save your time this place is gross.",

First we walk in and I see the hostess and smile and my wife says 4 and she replies oh let me check we're very busy. I think she forgot how to say hello first since they were super busy as she put it, but they were not very busy, restaurant was half empty.   We get to our booth and about 5-6 minutes pass and finally the server comes by and ask has anyone been by, we replied no and she's like ok, are we ready to order? We say no we're not and how about some micheladas and a few sodas for the kids. She returns a few minutes later with the 2 coronas and what looks like lime juice, so I ask kindly, may we have a little bit of Clamato and a shot of olive juice. She says sorry we don't make it like other places, we replied it's ok. She then returns with the Clamato, and says what else did you ask for.  I shook my head like it's ok, and my wife said just a shot of olive juice please.   She returned pretty fast and said ready  to order and we said yes, I ordered the grilled fish from the healthy options, and it was good besides it being way over salted, still edible and I don't mind salt so I finished it, but I can see anyone who doesn't like salt sending it back.  My wife then had a few questions about her order she was asking about 2 different menu items sauces and the waitress reply was I don't know how to explain it, so I helped and explained the sauces. (Really just a cream sauce on one and the other was a garlic, oil, tomato, pepper sauce). So my wife ordered the grilled steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers and a cream sauce with melted cheese over it.  It was the best dish we ordered. My kids had items off the kids menu that were just ok.  While eating our food we were ask about 5 times if we needed boxes, and our reply was always were still eating. Finally we asked for a box for my wife's plate and she brings the check before the box. Pretty confusing as we wanted desert. Anyhow we spoke to a manger expressing our frustration and disappointment at the service and she was apologetic. We also mentioned the hostess greet at the beginning when we first arrived and her response was oh well she's not feeling well so I'm sending her home now.  So I said we'll not feeling well shouldn't stop you from a smile and saying hello.  She agreed.  Final sum is that we would never go back, service wasn't good, menu knowledge wasn't good and overall friendliness was non existent. The manger didn't say anything to win us back either.   If you're in SW/summerlin area and want good Mexican you should try Juan's Flaming Fajitas, to were food and service is always good.",

I didn't want to send back the plate because our server seemed  so inconvenienced by us.he brought us refills for our drinks just once and left the empty cups, chips and salsas on the table making the table cramped.

Their salmon was a large portion with great flavor. I took it home and ended up with 2 more meals. The staff was beyond nice and very helpful. My wife had to adjust to the Tex mex flavor, but they worked with her and she was very satisfied.

It's not very often that a restaurant ticks every box but these guys did that and then some.   You will not be disappointed! And it's also very reasonably priced.",

We didn't have place settings and the food took such a long time to come out. Our server apologized and it definitely wasn't his fault- but again, empty booths everywhere and we were told the kitchen was behind.  The food itself was okay. It was kind of weird- the fajita chicken had some sort of gravy on it and no bell peppers, just onions. Meat was over cooked and under salted. I'd get a better bang for my buck and authentic Mexican food elsewhere. It's just kind of generic... nothing with the flare that a typical Mexican restaurant provides. It honestly felt like I was at Applebee's! Maybe it's just because they are new and getting the hang of things...?",

Anything with lime had a super strong lime taste.   I had some chicken enchiladas. They were really delicious, and the plating looked amazing. Usually Mexican restaurants bring out food thrown on some colored plates, but these had some love and time put in to presentation.  They also give you warm chips with 2 sauces for free. One sauce is a warm smokey red sauce, and a cold green avocado type sauce. So yummy!   My main recommendation is these plates a huge, so if you don't eat much, share, or plan to take some home.",

We arrived on Sunday too late for the brunch, but it looked amazing. We will be back just to try it out. The buffet appeared to have dozens of hot and cold items including a dessert station that I must admit I helped myself to a sample. A delicious  brownie covered in crunchy nuts.

Upon arrival I gave my name and we were immediately seated, they took our orders right away and the food took about 15 mins to get to us. No complaints here. The food was good but nothing special. My complaint is that we told the waiter it was our sisters birthday and we wanted to sing her happy birthday. About 10 mins later some lady greeted us grabbed the microphone and was promoting the radio station that was there, in the middle of that she said \"happy birthday Jasmine\" and then continued promoting the radio station and they're food, then left. Some of us didn't even notice she even said a happy birthday. We waited around a little more in hopes that they would still do something else but that never happened. We paid for our food and left. I thought maybe they just don't do much for their customers celebrating birthdays but after reading other reviews I'm finding out others were surprised with cake, a sombrero and waiters get together to sing happy birthday. I guess they don't treat all they're customers the same? It wasn't even busy, they could have made a better effort. Very disappointed.",

I also ordered a side of flour tortillas because I love homemade flour tortillas.  Those were not fully cooked. My husband ordered the ranchero style burrito with red sauce on top. The sauce looked delicious so it took a piece of my half cooked tortilla and dipped it into the sauce. Boy I thought I was in for a real treat that was my reaction.  The sauce tasted like ragu meat sauce oh I was dumbfounded. Really spaghetti sauce??? I thought maybe it was just the sauce on my husband's burrito so I tried the sauce from my daughter's enchilada  same  sauce.   We asked about the sauce and we were told that it was Texas style hmmmm.  I am Mexican and from California not from Texas therefore I obviously prefer a different style of Mexican food.  Our waitress was great though and the service was good.  The manager did come and ask how we liked our food and my husband told him the sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce I then added it was just different from what we are used to.   Anyway even though I was excited to find out they had a Sunday brunch buffet but this is not somewhere I will be returning to.",

The food is not authentic. Feels very processed  like Taco Bell quality. Definitely not real Mexican. We sampled several dishes and didn't really like any of it. The menu is also confusing and not very well laid out.   Just overall no authenticity or brand. Too bad because we need a good Mexican restaurant on this side of town. Would rather have Mimi's Cafe back.   Also, no tecate at a Mexican restaurant? Bizarre",

    "text": "Stuffed avocados, enough said.   I have to admit, I walked in with pretty low expectations but they proved me wrong. Walked in on a Friday night famished! As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. A few moments later our waitress came over to drop off chips and salsa, both green/red and took our drink requests. Soon after that another employee approached us and asked if we wanted to order guacamole, we of course said yes, she walked away only to return with a cart..she proceeded to make the guacamole right in front of us, after she was done, she asked us to taste it to make sure we approved of it, definitely a major plus.   Looking through the menu, everything looked pretty tasty but what caught my attention was the stuffed avocados. I was curious and intrigued so I went right ahead and ordered one. Food came out pretty quick and right away my mouth started salivating, my plate came with tortilla soup, beans, rice, a fajita taco and my stuffed avocado, big portions so come hungry. The stuffed avocado was breaded on the outside, despite it being cooked, the avocado was firm and fresh and it was filled with cheddar cheese and steak, happy bells went off in my head as soon as I took that first bite. The only downside to my dish was the fajita taco, they put a layer of cheese on top of it and melted it but it tasted like a kraft slice, other than that my meal was perfect. On another note, I noticed that their rice tasted just like Pollo Loco's, not their current rice but the way they used to make it years ago before they changed their recipe. That made me an even bigger fan! I washed everything down with a peach margarita, it was pretty good and you have the option of choosing salt or sugar for the rim.   Overall, I really liked this restaurant and I'll definitely be stopping by again, service was quick, staff was super friendly and very attentive, our waitress was on top of it. Prices are similar to Lindo's, maybe just a few cents cheaper but totally worth it. You won't be disappointed.",

The chicken in the  fajitas tasted like it was meant for a Chinese dish with a strong taste of soy sauce on a bed of onions; Literally just onions and chicken. Sucked!  Tortillas could have been good if they were not served on a paper towel in a French fry basket. They got hard after about 2 minutes.   Service was subpar with the waiter not asking our preference of beans or tortillas.   Chips and salsa were okay. The avocado dip tasted like green sour cream.   At the end of the day, of you are looking for authentic Mexican food PLEASE don't go here. Go to Juans flaming fajitas, it puts this place to shame. That is all.",

The food is super fresh, I didn't expect it to come out so quickly. I order the mix fajitas beef and chicken. The beef was very tender and the chicken had a great taste and wasn't dry.

    "text": "This is one of those restaurants I completely forget about after looking at it as I pass by. I wonder how the food is and wonder why I never noticed this place before.  Recently I found myself heading here after reading some positive Yelp reviews. They seem to have a huge following and been here awhile. So we ordered take out. I understand dining in is a superior experience....but NOT with my one year old. We ordered the standard fare: chicken enchiladas, Chili relleno, rolled chicken tacos, and a carne asada chimichanga.   1. I was immensely impressed by the huge bags we picked up and the amount of food we received for the modest price we paid. This was a damn good deal! 2. They were super friendly!  3. They also gave us chips and salsa to go which I figure is a dine in only incentive. They were awesome.  4. The food was delicious!   The chimichanga was half the size of the fast food competitors chimichanga but was great. It could have been crispier. But this may have been due to the fact I waited 15 minutes to drive home and eat. The rolled tacos were tasty and massively topped with cheese, sour cream and guac. The chili relleno was average but worth ordering again. The rice I definitely recall being less bland and more tastier than other places. It was good.   We will definitely come back here to dine in person. If it is that good to take out, dining in must be great. It's nice to find a good restaurant in the area to satisfy your craving. Tonight it was Mexican.",

My husband had a steak chimichunga and the meat was tough and difficult to chew. The lettuce garnish on his plate looked like it had been microwaved. My carnitas were terrible. They had burned the outsides of the meat, and when I ate a bite it was not good quality meat.  Too fatty and it tasted old. I did not eat it.  The waitress offered something else when she noticed I had pushed it aside.",

And charged me for mine on top of it!!! What they should have done is voided both for my inconvenience!!! Do not come here. Their staff is in adequate. And then they had the nerve to stare as I was filling out the receipt! Like you think I'm going to tip for that?! My $11 lunch cost me $46! And while I'll get my money back the manager should have done the right thing and not charged since THEY messed up! Never coming here again! And the food is okay at best.",

The manager walks around to check up on customers often which is pretty cool. Waiter was nice. Quick, attentive and polite.   Food was just okay. The sauces served for chips are a bit odd. You get one semi creamy, maybe avocado sauce and a warm red salsa. They taste okay though. I ordered beef fajita. My friends ordered burrito and quesadilla. Nothing notable. Fajita came with a lot of grilled onions and 2 grilled whole spicy pepper.   Don't come her for the food but you'll experience great service",

I called them letting them know that and they were super understanding! Our servers name I believe was Salvador? He was awesome!!! Had a good time with us while we all joked around with him and was very helpful! Let me tell you, my family is a handful but he delivered everytime! He went out of his way to get us just strawberries and pineapple for my nephew, my aunt didn't like a piece of meat because it was mostly fat and he brought her another one with no hesitation. I leaned forward and accidentally poked my left eye with the straw and everyone cracked up including him. It didn't feel like he was just a server it felt like we knew him! Keep up the great work! Oh also, the food was flipping amazing like ALWAYS! I absolutely love this place!",

They have a breakfast buffet every Sunday (I forgot the time) but it includes everything from Chilaquiles to tacos to churros and sopa pillas, as well as different types of Agua Frescas! Unfortunately I got there too late and they were taking it down so I didn't get to try the breakfast foods.  For lunch I ordered Ceviche and it was amazing. A little too fishy for my liking but still great nonetheless. They have an Ceviche Aguachile that I inquired about and it's in a habanero sauce which is really really spiced. So I ordered that on the side and mixed it into the traditional ceviche so it wasn't too spicy. Their chips and salsa are good as well. I would recommend this place but it is pretty pricey. I spent $70 including tip, for 2 people. Definitely worth a try though!",

We started out with warm chips and two choices of fresh salsa. The red salsa was my favorite and I could instantly feel that warm feeling in my heart that the food was made with love. There was a lot to choose from on the menu, both with drinks and food! My man and I ordered the Parrillada San Luis and the Carne Margarita. Everything tasted so fresh..from the beans, rice, meats, shrimp...just everything was made so carefully and each bite was like having a foodgasm LOL we also had a House Margarita on the rocks. I was curious about trying either the Watermelon and Serrano Margarita or the Pineapple and Jalapeno margarita. Our waiter suggested the pineapple one and it was so delicious. It was a bountiful meal so we had leftovers to take with us. The manager came around checking with patrons and chatted with us and told us about the history of the restaurant. I really enjoyed the manager and his attentiveness towards our stay. We did not have room for dessert, but we will definitely be coming back to try more of the other dishes!! I saw at a couple of tables that folks were having tableside things being made. That was very kewl. Five stars",

    "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this place after visiting the first time last night.  Pros The food was fantastic! We ordered chili con Queso to start. It tasted like a good mix of nacho cheese with pice de gallo on it. As well very well at the complementary salsa. I also ordered the shrimp jalapenos. They were surprisingly better than we planned! The had great flavor and just enough heat. Highlight of the meal definitely has to be the fajitas though. We ordered the beef fajitas for one and split them, it was plenty of meat only thing we needed was extra tortillas. The carne asada was super flavorful and the veggies were grilled perfectly.   Cons We ordered the small chili con queso but got charged for a large one.  We ordered 2 shots of Correlejo rep at 9.95/per shot. The shots were no more than .75 ounces (pretty sure they were only .5 oz) when I mentioned something to our server about how much it would cost to get a bigger shot he told us those were 2 ounce shots. Me being a bartender for many many years knows the difference. He then brought us 2 more shots on the house. But I feel totally scammed. Had I not said anything they were charging me $20 for less than 2oz of tequila.  I then got the spicy pineapple margarita, which tasted as if it had no pineapple in it, so I asked for a small side of pineapple juice so sweeten it up a little. Get the bill and he charged us $1.50 for it.   When I go out I plan on spending money, and understand that you have to charge for things, but between getting charged for the wrong appetizer, getting shorted on the shots and getting charged for a small side of pineapple juice I don't know how to feel about this place, which sucks because the food is amazing!",

To start: the chips and salsa are mostly standard fair. The green salsa is cold and refreshing, chips taste fresh. They have an option for a 10oz draft Modelo. Perfect for me as I drink beer slowly. So cute too. One thing I had to ding a star for, service was slooooow. I mean, exceptionally slow for a Sunday afternoon with only a half full restaurant.  Regardless, I ordered the chicken garibaldi and my husband had the smothered beef burrito.  The food was fantastic. The tortillas are delicious.  Despite this experience I would confidently say I will happily go back and try more options.",

    "text": "I really really enjoyed the food and the employees are all very nice. I did NOT like the tortilla soup as there was no chicken and cheese. They have a good happy hour menu which I would like to try. It was PACKED on the weekend when I went. Lunch on the other hand is not as busy. They do take out ordering and everything was packed in a nice bag.   They have a mariachi band on the weekends in which was WAY too loud when you walk in. I could not even wait in the front lobby area cause I was getting my ear drums blown out. It was nice to listen to from far away from the front area is way to small to have a full blown band in the front. My kid started crying. TOO LOUD!  A few kinks, we sat at a table last time we were there and had ordered table side gauc. The lady could not come to our table because the cart would not fit. So, she was practically across the restaurant making our food, while kids from other tables were looking over it. Yea no thanks! She also served 3 other people at what looked like one of the band members tables before getting to us so our food was already out before getting our guacamole.   We also had come with a toddler and they did not offer a highchair or booster. It was very odd. I asked for one which they eventually brought. We gave in and ended up ordering a few margaritas cause that is what you do when you eat Mexican food. They ended up being $14 a piece. Pretty pricey for what it was. We spent a LOT of money just on drinks and the meat and fish platter (which was really good). It was too much money for us and will likely be going somewhere else on the weekend. Considering its proximity to where I at a lot it is nice to have the option for Mexican. I will probably stick to happy hour or to go options.",

    "text": "I'm really excited that a new sit down Mexican restaurant has opened on my side of town. This is a small chain from Texas and the food is good, if atypical, Southwestern style Mexican food. Los Cucos can't compete with Vegas local powerhouse Lindo Michoacan, but it still has pretty good eats and great service.   The interior is strange, a rag-tag looking atmosphere in what is (obviously) a space formerly inhabited by MiMi's Cafe. The Mardi Gras balcony is still there, but now there's some sparse, randomly placed Mexican decor lining the walls. The restaurant feels spacious, open and clean, and there's a particularly nice open bar area right inside the front door. The place lacks character, but it's a pleasant enough atmosphere.   I had to laugh at the menu because it's loaded with misspellings (\"crispi\" tacos, \"romain\" lettuce) and some of the descriptions are exactly the same for different items (check out the special fajitas on the menu). When I pointed this out to our server, she couldn't explain it nor tell me which item it was that was the correct description. I eventually got what I wanted, but the menu had the dish listed under two different names. You'd think for a chain restaurant, the menu would be consistent (and free of spelling errors).   As with most Mexican eateries, the house serves complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good enough but served cold; the salsas are DELICIOUS. Like seriously delicious. There's a spicy, smoky red salsa that's served warm and a fantastic avocado crema style cold salsa. Both of these were the highlight of my meal and I am still craving them (they'll make me return to the restaurant often).   We ordered the queso with shrimp as an appetizer. At $11.95, it's overpriced. The cheese wasn't that warm when it was served and the queso was loaded with red onions, mushrooms and other unnecessary stuff. The shrimp was seasoned well and quite delicious; however, I wouldn't order this again.   For lunch I ordered chicken fajitas and my husband ordered steak fajitas. The meat quality was top-notch. I LOVED the marinade on both of the meats, and we both agreed the meat was some of the best in town. The fajita vegetables were just okay -- onions and poblano peppers. I was disappointed in the overall fajitas, but I'd love to have just the meat served on its own. I had fajitas that came \"loaded\" with bacon and cheese, and it was an unusual and very tasty combo. The side plate was huge and had so/so beans, average rice, and very tasty guacamole and pico de gallo.   Fatty alert: they serve homemade flour tortillas, and they are delicious! I love Mexican restaurants that care enough to make legit tortillas, and I'm happy that Los Cucos does it right. I could've eaten two dozen of them! It's a bummer that they aren't served in tortilla warmers to keep them soft but instead are plopped on the table sandwiched between paper towels. This means the tortillas get hard very quickly. Best to gobble them up as soon as possible!  After our lunch, Jesus the manager came over to ask how we enjoyed everything. He was very eager to please and happy to listen to our suggestions. I was very impressed with this personal touch and the efficient, friendly service we received.   This isn't the best Mexican food in Vegas, but the kitchen uses very high quality ingredients, the prices on most menu items are fair, and the service is good. This is a great place to add to the dining rotation, especially if you live near Mountain's Edge and the Arroyo.",

The servers were nice as well but the food was horrible.  The chips that were severed tasted okay but were like chips from a bag.  The salsas were okay but had little flavor.  We ordered the Chile Con Queso $9.50 with ground beef.  The flour tortilla chips that came with it were good but the dip itself tasted like it came from a can - the big can of cheese.  We had a few bites but didn't each much of it.  We there ordered the Family Appetizer $16.99.  When it arrived it did not look appetizing at all.  The presentation was bad and what was on there was worse.  The stuff jalapenos looked good but they tasted like pickled jalapenos from a jar.  There were some chips with overcooked meat on them, flautas that were just okay and the chicken quesadilla didn't have much flavor.  The cheese sauce in the middle of the plate also tasted like cheese sauce right out of the can.  The only good thing was the hot salsa the server brought us and the margarita $11.99 which was very good.  Also there is no ambiance in the place.  The lights are too bright and felt like sitting in a fast food restaurant.  Super disappointed in the quality of the food.  There are so many good choices for Mexican food in Las Vegas, was so disappointed this wasn't one of them. I rated it 2 stars because the staff/servers were very nice and the margarita was very good.",

They have upped the game and improved.   ******************************************** MEH, I think that sums it up best.  The food is uninspiring and just run of the mill generic Americanized Mexican food.  The decor is tacky and uninteresting.  The service was ok, our waiter was not very friendly but he did take good care of us.     The food was plentiful but not very interesting.  I ordered chicken fajitas and the chicken came in these huge strips of meat.  You could tell that the chicken and the veggies were food separately.

They also had amazing Salsa and cilantro dip.  We had such a fun time talking to our server.  She was so nice and everyone was very attentive.  The food was big portions and excellent prices.  Our server was Luptia and she was the Best!!!!",

What was most irritating is the waitress who initially took our drink order never came back to tell us she was leaving.  Place is very disorganized.

Very satisfying experience us consistently now.",

I loved it.  Their carnitas were a little on the sour side, but nothing to lose stars over. Fresh homemade flour tortillas!!  Yummy",

You're going to fill up on chips (because the chips are super light and salty and crispy) and salsa (try the green stuff, it's delicious!) and then they'll bring you your shrimp-stuffed avocado with a fish taco on the side and you'll be like \"OOF\" and you'll hate yourself.  The fish taco heats up beautifully the next day, just FYI.  Service was slow but attentive.  I think it's because the kitchen was just busy.  The $5 house margarita is a solid, generous pour.",

We ordered the spicy  cucumber margarita which was amazing, comes with two glasses and a bottle.  When she brought it over, half of the bottle poured on the table and made its way to the floor splashing on to my shoe and pant.  She apologized but didn't offer to give us the 15.99 bottle half off, so we ordered another one to give her the opportunity, nope.  The next thing we noticed was extremely unprofessional.  The people next to us had a different waitress, they had already received their drinks and placed their orders.  They decided to move tables and I guess the new table they chose was now our waitresses.  As the other waitress brought out the food to the guests who were now at a different table, our waitress literally stood like two inches from her face saying they were her guests, she was so close to her, the other waitress couldn't even get around her to serve the guests.  She should have handled this in the back of house, not caused a scene in front of multiple guests.    I can't remember the waitresses name tother than the first letter of her name, S.  she also wore braces and a thin head band with white flowers on it.  We will definitely go back because of the food and ambience but will be requesting any server but her.",

So imagine my surprise when I saw a Los Cucos was not only opening in Vegas, but actually opening on our side of town! I literally thought I'd seen a mirage initially...... anyhow, the food has definitely reminded me of home and has been worth every penny we've spent on our half dozen trips there. I hope they are able to expand here, the whole Valley deserves authentic Tex-Mex cuisine. So far weve enjoyed their queso flameado, queso, and beef/chicken fajitas - but we can't wait to sample more of the menu. Keep up the great work Los Cucos, Vegas is lucky to have you!",

You are greeted promptly at the door upon arrival by smiling faces. All of the employees are friendly, smiling, and ready to help. The food was great and the Sangria's (a house recipe) and margaritas were magnifico! We had an opportunity to meet the Asst. Manager, Miguel (who is handsome AF), and the Manager, Jesus, both of whom were extremely helpful when we needed to talk business for our party. The restrooms were clean. The bar area is stunning. The location is great!! This is just a wonderful, family-owned restaurant of which I'll visit again and again.",
