    "text": "I recently just heard of this place and am blown away it's been open for 15 months and I just discovered it! I will say, I have heard of it, but in conversations, I thought people were talking about the other one with one T downtown. Oh boy are they different! Eatt is Amazing! I finally found it on Eater and glad I came! A good friend was visiting from out of town and she wanted something fresh and healthy. I wanted something new to me. So we came here and we're NOT disappointed. I honestly, have nothing negative to say. Together we had 6 dishes and then 2 desserts, sharing it all. The decor was clean and bright and I loved the feel inside. We decided on two of their baguette with toppings, the summer salad, and the octopus carpaccio. First of all, the octopus was amazing! Pickled veggies and citrus on top!!!! Something different and such a great combo. Then the summer salad with fruit and freeze dried balsamic. Beautiful and delicious. My favorite was the goat cheese baguette. Oh my word. Carmelo was dominos and warm goat cheese, candied pecans and freeze dried honey chips.... so much yes... Our other baguette was tipped with prosciutto and tomatoes and pesto... delicious as well.  We finished with the \"exotic\" dessert and the cream puffs. Both were great. Coconut, matcha, and passion fruit flavors really were a great way to end. And the hazelnut cream puffs... yup. I'll take more please. I will definitely return to try other menu items!",

    "text": "Delicate flavors,  such attention to detail.  I was attending a dinner party that was catered by Yury and Vincent.  They served these beautiful buffet style platters. They were pieces of art I had to photograph them before we devoured them.  The amuse bouche was a lovely chilled Asparagus soup,  it had a parmesan chip and Asparagus spear as garnish,  just lovely.   The main course  was slow cooked Chicken breast that was Oh so tender and juicy. The vegetarian main was Ratatouille, if your not familiar with this French dish it's all vegetarian, it's egg plant and zucchini, tomato, red bell pepper,  herb dish simply delicious. Many of our friend are vegetarian so this was a big hit.    Other of the dishes where a broccomoly, with corn chips.  This was just delicious and a great appetizer.  It was a smooth guacamole inspired broccomoly, it was made with broccoli. Someone actually asked \"it's not guacamole?\"   Then there was a reminder of a classic nicoise salad but with anchovies and surrounded by perfectly cut English Cucumber. The balance of savory and sweet was perfect. Quiet delicious.   Another lovely salad was a heirloom tomato and Mozzarella platter.  Made to be feasted on.  I could of ran away with it and enjoyed all by my self.  Sharing is overrated.   Yuri and Vincent,  you guys have a great thing going here.",

All of us got a meal but we could have just done the apps and dessert because the we didn't have room for dessert.   Service was awesome, very knowledgeable staff who was happy to answer questions.   Recommend the ceviche and tuna/salmon carpaccio for sure. It's nice that they have options for vegans as well. Very satisfying for all in the group. Will be back for sure.

I took my godmother to lunch here for her birthday for two very specific reasons- first, it was French, which of course she loves. Secondly, they boasted a decadent vegan menu complete with artisan cashew cheeses, a thoughtful move for a restaurant that serves bother omnivores and herbivores. The panini I enjoyed was the best panini of my life! Well seasoned vegan beef was sandwiched between two slices of perfectly crusty yet soft ciabatta, with a tangy smear of cashew cheese and finished with a sweet basil dressing that crept into every airy pocket of bread. The flavors were absolutely incredible, all well balanced and playing hopscotch with the textures. A truly magnificent dining experience and one I intend to repeat soon! Make your life better and go visit, its more than it boasts to be.",

We try the raviolis, pork shoulder, the cod, besides the quality of the food, is how fresh everything taste. To end our experience we have the cappuccino tartelette . After you have a good food, I have to mention the service, is Phenomenal, very attentive, knowledgeable. We love them, it feels part of the family's every time we go to EATT.",

Now, I could take every single word back. I've been to this restaurant many times, and the service is good, their menu is organized, their food looks impressive, and their desserts are my favorite part. Their cream puffs are super delicious if you want any recommendations. It's not an extremely formal place, so there's no need to dress up really fancy. Now that I'm done complimenting the place: The one thing I wouldn't recommend is their summer salad. (The one with watermelons and balsamic). It was a pain to eat in all honesty. The reason this still has a four is because their other dishes are really fresh and if I weren't so picky on which foods I liked (goat cheese, walnuts, etc), then I would probably give this place a five out of five. So keep in mind this is my personal preference. Hope this helped!",

    "text": "There are plenty of places in Vegas that make food that is pretty enough to be art. But those places are usually on the Strip, ridiculously priced, and likely just as bad for your waistline as your wallet. Enter Eatt: a French-run bistro-style lunch joint with a focus on healthy, fresh foods. I don't think I could have dreamed it up.  Over the past month, I've been by a handful of times and tried the majority of the menu. Favorites include the quiche (perfect for a late breakfast!), the salmon club (it even travels well!), and the ratatouille rolls (I grab them as a side for my protein at home). The broccoli-guacamole was an interesting app (and I'd love to see what they could do with a pea version!) but the desserts are where they shine.  The menu lists which desserts are healthier and which are more indulgent, which is helpful as they all look amazing. The strawberry-rhubarb macaron (healthy side) was a delight, but the Exotic Fruits (combining coconut, passion fruit, and matcha) recommended by the staff was even better, reminding me of Yonaka's desserts with the beautiful plating and Japanese flavor influence.   Staff provides excellent service, Nicolas in particular always looks genuinely happy to help each patron. The interior is a fun mix of modern furniture and garden decor accents, complete with miniature terrariums on the tables. So glad this spot opened in such a convenient location- now I can grab a great meal before or after the gym, without compromising on flavor or my goals!",

The summer salad was refreshing with an amazing collection of watermelon balls, olives, cantaloupe, greens and cheese with a nice balsamic dressing.   I had a very nicely done Cornish Hen where half came with crunchy skin while the breast   came with a velvety cream sauce.    As noted in other reviews the restaurant was strangely empty.  With food as good as this place serves it should have lines waiting to get in.  My guess is the decor takes away from the food to the point that people do not appreciate the food. It would be so simple to paint the ceiling black and replace all the prison lighting with small spot lights.  It would be transformed into a comfortable place to eat and the food would be the focus.",

The staff is usually so amazing and most of our lunch today that remained.  When I told our waitress at the end of the meal how amazing the food was, but told her I was so cold...she said...\"wow that is strange the temperature is always the same and we have had no complaints.\" Made us feel a bit silly.   I watched a couple cup their coffee to warm up and the bathroom was freezing.  I know we are experiencing colder weather for us this time of the year but the comment didn't sit well with both of us.  I don't disparage the waitress, except, all she had to say was..\" I am sorry and I will look into it.\"  That's  it. Not that we were wrong.",

We had the moussaka and desserts and some other things I can't remember but it was ALL delicious.    Now, True story: I planned a trip near Grand Canyon 2 weeks ago.  While our main trip was visiting Havasupai, I specifically set a one-night pit-stop in Vegas, with the sole purpose of going to Eatt.  (my bf can attest to this, I could not stop talking about it, for months).  Arrived in Vegas on Saturday night a bit tired, so we thought we'd save Eatt (literally my only reason to stop by Vegas) for Sunday.  The next morning, practically jumping out of the bed to go to Eatt, we found out it is CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!!!!!!!  completely ruined my day (again, boyfriend can attest to this.  I pouted for at least 2 hours).    So the moral of the story is REMEMBER THEYRE CLOSED ON SUNDAY!! Get your good Eatts fix Monday - Saturday!",

Leaving the restaurant thinking about how good the desserts were compared to the savory dishes is not the best way to remember a meal.  The savory dishes for the most part were lacking in seasoning.  The presentation is exceptionally good looking and make the food something you want to dig into.  When we got to the chicken, we both mentioned about it needing something even just plain salt.  It wasn't until later that I saw on a table where the artificial sweeteners were, there were also salt and pepper grinders.  Too late.  The chicken and later the angus beef were lacking in seasoning.  Moving past the savory dishes and moving to dessert showed where Eatt shines at the present time.  A favorite of mine was the tiramisu prepared and presented in quite a different manner.  The poached peach with a nougat center and sprinkled with some pistachio pieces and the praline puffs were very well executed and were quite good.  The restaurant has a lot of promise.  The chefs are trying different things and the plating is very successful.  The savories need work with seasoning.   The place is very bright and pleasant.  There are a lot of window space that gives the place a nice, lighted interior.",

The Beef melted in your mouth with a pre-cut serving and a small potato cake on the side. Each an every bite better than the last. The Squid was remarkable with a creamy froth sauce surrounding it.

The vegan and gluten free options are abundant and unique. Many of the dishes are available as grab and go items for convenience, but I had the opportunity to dine in and enjoy a few items served on nice plates. Service was excellent and the chef visited the dining area to greet the guests.  The ratatouille rolls resembled a tapas portion. This suited me just fine because I don't like being served large portions and I wanted to try a dessert, but I know many people think differently. The beautiful hibiscus poached pear decorated with toasted almonds was the first item to catch my eye in the display so I ordered that for dessert. It was glazed perfectly with the hibiscus reduction. I'd love this dessert even more if it was filled with almond cream or served with ice cream, so I took it home to add a scoop since they didn't have any at the restaurant.  Spend over $20 for a chance to spin the prize wheel. I was very lucky to win a free dessert on my next visit, so I will be back very soon. I'm looking forward to the burrata salad and trying more sweets designed by eatt's talented pastry chef.",

I'm guessing that most people who come in alone are only there to order or pickup takeout? Once seated though my waiter gave me such attentive service that I no longer felt odd. And another single diner came in as I was paying my bill. Honestly, the service here is impeccable. Towards the end of my meal another waiter came by to clear my plate and ask if I wanted dessert. When my waiter reappeared a couple of minutes later, he apologized profusely for making me wait.  I ordered the Impossible Burger which came upon recommendation from the waiter and was very yummy (although a bit too meat-like for this girl who really doesn't like red meat). The hashbrowns acting as buns was a nice to choice but made i the burger very hard to pick up. I ended up eating the entire meal with a fork and knife.  The price for the burger and cabbage salad was a bit steep at $18. Add that to my espresso, tax and tip, my quick Monday lunch cost over $25. But I'll always pay more for quality. Next time I'm going back just to try their onion soup.",

Very creative, but more importantly, VERY delicious. Definitely if you come here give it a try!  The minestrone soup was good too! It came topped with a tarragon foam. The whole meal was light and somehow filling at the same time! My stomach thanked me!  We would definitely recommend!!!   Extra points for gorgeous decor and friendly staff! :)",

I came here for the first time on Thursday, August 16, 2018 with a few coworkers as it was a place that was recommended to us to come during our lunch break. The decor of the place is decent and it wasn't that busy. Upon looking at the menu, nothing that wasn't an appetizer appeared to be under $15. Surprisingly, the cost wasn't too much of an issue until.. So remember when I said some work colleagues and I had come during our lunch. We had a helpful waiter who made recommendations. Sadly to say that there was a couple that sat at a table next to us who probably came in about 15mins after we did which both tables ordered within minutes of each other. The other table received their order while we never got our order and ended up having to take it to go when it came out as it was already over an hour. My colleague order the set plate deal that came with sandwich, soup, dessert, and drink for $25 and I order the Salmon which was $21, I paid for the table and we get back to the office to eat our lunches and I was very disappointed of the portion size that I received for $21. I'm from Houston, TX and for $21 you get at least half the Salmon. I don't usually leave poor reviews but the portion size for $21 is unacceptable- but take a look for yourself and let me know if I'm in the wrong for being upset with what I got for the price that I paid. I will never come back here to eat again.",

There were four of us for dinner, and we ordered 5 entrees, and a few appetizers, all to share. There wasn't a single thing that we wouldn't order again. The soups were outstanding the goat cheese appetizer was mouth watering, and the salmon was out of this world! There was a vegetarian entree that was also quite delicious, and the pasta dish was filling without being heavy. Dessert was a whole new level of mind blowing. The passion fruit squares LITERALLY brought tears to my eyes. The coconut chia parfait was good, but couldn't compete with the passion fruit dessert that I tried first. The cream puffs were also quite tasty but again, the passion fruit dessert won my heart and nothing could compare.   I WILL fly to Las Vegas just to eat dinner at Eatt. It is a hidden gem, off the strip, and not pretentious at all. What an incredible restaurant, with staff and owners that truly care about the food they are serving their customers. You will not be disappointed by choosing to dine here over any of the fancy fine dining spots on the strip. Do yourself a favor, and pay the extra uber fare to go to Eatt!",

This place has good potential considering it is a health conscious spot with quality ingredients and the presentations are on point. Unfortunately there were a few flaws within my meal. I started with the broccomole which is their take on guacamole but made with broccoli. It was really clean and delicious served with some semi stale tortilla chips. I got the tuna Nicoise salad which came with a very subtle tasting dijon dressing that was a bit too thick but it did pair well with the salad. All in all it was very good and I would order it again. For my entree I got the chicken with pea puree. The chicken was kinda bland but it's saving grace was the puree because it was delicious and gave it flavor. The sauce or reduction got hardened before it got to my table so it was disappointing that I couldn't really try it. There were also some pieces of pancetta on the plate and I don't remember seeing it in the description which sucks since I don't eat pork :/ I just set it aside. I love their concept on healthy, clean eating. The presentation looked great on everything I got and I can appreciate all the fresh ingredients but I had better expectations. I spent about 35 and tipped 5 and I feel like my meal wasn't worth  40 bucks with all the flaws. I'm sad I didn't spend it on ayce sushi lol.",

Starting with the raspberry lemonade...did not have much flavor of lemonade, let alone hardly any flavor or essence of raspberry.  The Chicken wrap was flavorless although a bit better than the Ham and Cheese on a french baguette.   This was totally flavorless, and the bread was not very good. I've tasted a lot of french baguettes over the years, but this was not good at all.  It tasted kind of like frozen bread from a grocery store.  No garnish on either plated sandwich.  The price came to $30 which was not worth it for a flavorless meal.   Definitely add a bit of salt.   It was nicely decorated and very clean.",

Throughout our dinner experience, Jose and Nicolas are so friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and accommodating, along with their chefs' genuine creativity, detailed thoughtfulness in the dishes they made, our degree of liking for this place grew from 'mild (skeptical)' to 'intense (loving it!!!!!!)' by the end of the night.   The presentation of every dish is exquisite, taste is light yet explosive in flavors.   Good to know that they do catering for special occasions on/offsite. Definitely worth giving them a try!!!  Eatt, keep doing what you are doing!!!",

What's impeccable about these dishes was that we can taste each ingredient all beautifully blended together. That's one superb chef! For dessert we had their raspberry macaron and exotic. Both were beautifully presented and super tasty. I seriously can't wait to visit eatt gourmet bistro again!",

The first thing you notice is this place is very clean and the interior is decorated in a sleek manor..pleasant. The menu is super limited. The service was attentive and pleasant. I'm just gonna say that I'm not a huge fan of she she French food..but with that said this place offers a nice selection of healthier choices then a lot of places. I ordered the chicken wrap. I'm sorry to say it was extremely bland and uninspiring. It was around 14 bucks and I felt it needed a lot more kick. It came on a plain plate with no garnish. I'm not sure if garnish is just not a French thing but it would be nice to get some sides to come with the sandwhich, that is customary in this country. Overall this place is not my cup of tea. I'm not going to tell them to change this or that apparently there are plenty of people enjoying their food. So I wish you success !",

The pot au feu's chicken bone broth with veggies really settled my irritable digestive system, and despite the small portions, my stomach was quite satisfied with the meal.  Of course, I couldn't resist sampling a few of the desserts too.  Omg, the apple-pie like macaron will now be the standard by which I base all others!  The citrus- topped, coconut tapioca pudding was also both rich and refreshing!  A huge thank you to my attentive and menu-knowledgeable server, Justin, who let me spin the wheel before I headed out.

Although I wish it was all vegan so I could have endless options, they have about 9 vegan menu items and they are phenomenal. We had the carrot cold soup (omg I died and went to heaven, i'm obsessed with kumquats so this just made my life complete), the leeks (my boyfriends favorite, he ordered a second one after our entree ), the Bolognaise Raviolis, and the coconut panna cotta. They KILLED it. I want to come back tomorrow and eat. And the next day and the next. So glad we finally tried it, and it's close to our house. Great job chefs! Now just veganize the whole menu",

The food along with its presentation was wonderful!!!!! Loved every single bite from appetizer to desert  Our waitress and here's where I embarrass myself because I'm usually a stickler for remembering names (I think it was Jess) she was Fantastic.. so thank you to her! Chef Yuri personally came out to greet us and asked how our meal was; which we made sure to let him it was fantastic!! Looking forward to going back very soon!!",

Likes: the service, the dinner entrees (duck breast, and I LOVED the ratatouille), the soups (butternut squash), and the passion fruit dessert (I love passion fruit and guava).  The atmosphere is a clean and simple white linen look, aside from the large wheel you spin if you buy a sandwich combo.  Dislikes:  their lunch time sandwiches.  I wouldn't recommend any of these.  I had the hot dog one and the lamb one, both of which were underwhelming in quantity and taste.    This would definitely be in my rotation to take family and friends after they've tried the iconic places",

The menu is not overly large and split into a few sections . There is a vegan section if you're into that as well . We had  2 small soups  . The butternut soup was very good and had a coffee foam and some very tasty mushrooms . The French onion soup was also very good in the classic French onion way .   We chose to order an app instead of an entree . We ordered the goat cheese baguette tartine . It was just ok and was a little on the sweet side for an appetizer for our taste , although if you're into the sweeter side of food I'm sure you would love it .   The service was attentive and the servers were very nice .   We were given a free chestnut puff dessert because it took a little while to bring our appetizer . Otherwise a pretty spot on place to dine .",

The 6 oz of meat was drowned (yes, completely smothered) in a mushroom puree sauce. Why so much sauce? There was more sauce than meat and the sauce was tasteless. The meat was accompanied by a small ramekin of potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were undercooked and again the dish was tasteless. I expected some flavor but nothing. And my dish overall looked horrible. A ton of bland brown sauce covering two lumps of meat and a side of bland potatoes. No garnish. Seriously, no vegetables or something to make the dish look appetizing? No way a Michelin star chef made this dish. It was an embarrassment. The portions were very small, too. The worst part is the dish cost $34, insanely expensive for a small steak and a small portion of potatoes. Since I didn't eat the potatoes I basically paid a ton for a piece of meat. I left feeling ripped off.  And, note to the owner, if your AC is not working could you at least put ice in the water? I cannot believe how hot it was and not one effort was made to make the guests more comfortable. Maybe offer a cool drink on the house? The heat made me so uncomfortable eating. Honestly, I wish I could get my money back.",

We usually order the steak, salmon and duck. All excellent to keep us coming back. However, the last time we were there in July, the salmon and the duck were both changed and the new recipes left us very disappointed. The service is generally fine (could use a bit more relaxed warmth) but inconsistent sometimes, especially when you get 2-3 different people serving you throughout an evening, something will be missing. I understand it's a small staff. Sometimes it still feels like an experimental pop-up. This can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for. I personally feels like since the set up is casual and healthy food, the atmosphere should be more lively. I kept wishing someday I will walk in there and it will be loud and fun. I still do.",

The decor is clean, comfortable, and modern. The service was spot on with beautiful explanations of the specials. We had the broccoli guac which was yummy and smooth with a little heat. We ordered one special, cold pineapple and pepper soup which included yellow beats, crispy basil, and vegan mozzarella. I'm not vegan but this sounded so interesting that we tried it. It was pretty,  flavorful, and had complex tastes that caused us to stop and savor it.  We also had the goat cheese on toasted bread with carmelized onions, sweet pecans, and freeze dried honey crisp and greens. This was SO good!! We also had the steak salad with a tasty light dressing that included lychee. The exotic dessert was possibly the best thing I've EVER eaten. This place was amazing. The flavors and textures and beautiful presentation were spectacular. We will be back!",

    "text": "Healthy and affordable lunch place revisited by Michelin-star French chefs... I went there for the grand opening, and the next day during normal operations. First of all, the restaurant is very conveniently located, on Sahara and Buffalo, in a busy area, and very visible from the street. They have an ample patio space in front that they might use in the future, but it is not used yet. Then, once you get in, the atmosphere and the design of the main room are very unique, bringing a very modern, contemporary European flavor that we don't get to see in Las Vegas. It is very nicely decorated, with great attention to details, and perfectly clean. It gives you this relaxing and comfortable feel, that I could describe in one word: \"zen\". The staff is courteous and efficient, very nice and, you can tell, very passionate and proud to be working in this new and unique restaurant. Finally, I kept the best part for the end: the food... After all, it is a restaurant, so it should be important. The menu shows a great variety of healthy meals and desserts. Eatt is mainly open for lunch (at least for now), and you have the option to eat on site or to go. I was lucky enough to get a taste of the whole menu during the grand opening event they had, and I was blown away. Both the food and the desserts are made by French chefs coming from Michelin-star restaurants in France. They bring to the menu a touch of originality and sophistication, without being arrogant or too complicated. They bring a symphony of flavors to very simple courses which could be otherwise boring, all of that at a very reasonable price. They use only high quality and healthy ingredients, so you won't find fat and greasy food there. Overall, the decor, the room, the staff and the food bring a very refreshing concept that was missing in Las Vegas, especially in the hot Summer! I wish them success, and I hope they open more restaurants in the future, so I always have one nearby!",

Don't be fooled: It looks vaguely like a juice bar/acai bowl-type place, but the refined flavors and presentation are on par with a very high-end restaurant. What a lovely surprise, then, to embark on a gustatory adventure when the setting (and prices) are so comfortably low-key. The food is not only good, it surprises and delights--the hallmark of an exceptional restaurant. Everything we tried was wonderful, from the classic ham & cheese baguette to an ambitious butternut squash soup that was topped with coffee foam, truffle oil, and sauteed mushrooms. Don't miss the superb tiramisu, enhanced from the standard offering by a crunchy chocolate topping. I think it's worth noting that our children, 9 and 11, had a wonderful time here and cleaned their plates. We are very grateful to the staff and chef for their dedication to their craft and sincere hospitality, and wish them every success.",

    "text": "This was my first time dining here and I was impressed by its inclusion on the Eater Essential 38 for Vegas.  In short, I was blown away and cannot do it justice in a review.   The cuisine was just outstanding in every way.  It was delicious, high quality food minimally processed, yet presented in a fashion reminiscent of a Michelin Star restaurant.   This is not surprising, considering the impressive background of the French chefs.  The cost of the meal was a third of what you'd pay for a similar experience in one of the gourmet rooms on the Strip, yet the food was just as good.   The concept of Eatt may be off-putting to some serious gourmands, as the \"healthy\" banner often means bland, uninteresting food.  These chefs clearly demonstrate you can have your cake and eat it too.  Speaking of pastry, the desserts reminded me of some I've had in high end patisseries in Paris.  Both of the chefs are on their way up and will be big names someday.  Get here sooner than later, and order the Chef's Tasting Menu for a great demonstration of what they can do.  I can't wait for my next visit!",

We shared an appetizer, pan con tomato, which was amazing--beautifully presented, jamon, tomato and pesto on a piece of toasted baguette, with a really interesting and delicious \"piece\" of freeze-dried balsamic vinegar. For main I had the beef special of the day, beautifully medium-rare strips of ribeye with a wine reduction, with pureed vegetable, morel mushrooms and peas--an excellent combination. For dessert we shared the cream puffs with praline pastry cream, quite delicious. We also had a glass of Cores du Rhone which was excellent and very reasonably priced. The restaurant subtitle is Healthy Food, and I found the freshness of the ingredients and the method of preparation to make good on that claim while also introducing new ideas and new ways of appreciating food.",

Promoting what the restaurant describes as \"healthy gourmet recipes adapted to your diet offered with seasonal ingredients,\" and doing a great diligence in detailing the menu with food allergies, sensitivities and exclusions for dairy, gluten, nuts plus meat, the first impression of Eatt is generated by the brilliant white and clean lines, a modern feel that seems sterile despite plants on walls as well tables while a television hangs awkwardly near the door as though every restaurant in town cannot afford to be without.  Greeted by all three members of the team throughout the stay, one female server assisting with plates, the meal began with a flaky housemade Croissant that rivals many in the city, though the butter-soaked bottom somewhat compromises the shell's integrity while the Chocolate version and Seasonal Danish advertised on the menu were both apparently sold-out.  Told by Nicolas that the restaurant typically offers a few off-menu specials, on this day a delicate Ravioli stuffed with finely diced Vegetables topped with poached Lobster in a Shellfish Bisque, dishes like this show the high degree of technical skill offered by Chef Szarzewski, though unfortunately several to follow would fall short by yielding to \"healthy\" constraints.  Told that the Salmon has quickly become the restaurant's best seller, the thin filet marinated before being placed atop a coil of Sprouts, Apples and Beets, plating at Eatt is unsurpassed at its pricepoint and although a sweeter apple plus some acid may have helped this dish better show the complexity of its flavors it was easily the best entree offered, the Chicken virtually flavorless even with the Bacon imbued Broth while the radiant Ratatouille helped to prop up tender strips of Angus that again had the table looking for a shaker of salt.  A bit disappointed at this point, but finding the vegetables to be highlights of each plate, it was with good fortune that the Mushroom Quiche and a side of \"Broccoli Guacamole\" was requested, the former making good use of the lightest amount of Truffle Oil to accent Shitakes and Leeks in a fluffy Egg Custard while the later was creamy, cool and vibrant on gently salted Crisps.  Appreciating the concept both as a physician and diner, the need for well-priced alternatives to \"quick-casual\" staples like Panera, Chipotle and others something the nation surely needs, it was here that Pastry Chef Pellerin took over the tasting, a poached Peach showcasing the season with a Nougat core and crushed Pistachios in light Syrup while the linear Brest, liquid-centered Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Pure Chocolate Cake were all individually portioned and full-flavored rivals to what several restaurants have to offer at an inflated price-point on the Strip.  *** Acknowledging that healthy means different things to different people, one person's Veganism or anti-GMO Politics irrelevant to a patient with Diabetes following a low-carb diet or the Hypertensive adhering to DASH Guidelines, there is a point where \"taste\" must be incorporated into every recipe, something that the EATT team will hopefully find a way to exemplify while still sticking to the concept they hope to promote.",

    "text": "I don't eat out that much anymore. Doctor-imposed dietary restrictions over the last year or so have found me eating a lot more at home. And when I do eat out, it's always tempting to eat the wrong thing (because it's there) or drive everyone nuts with questions about how food is prepared. Eatt (7865 W. Sahara, Las Vegas) appears to know me and others like me.   My first visit exceeded what I thought was possible of a healthy quickserv restaurant. From the crisp interior design and knowledgable staff, to the presentation and taste of the food, Eatt is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas food scene. And one doesn't have to battle traffic or out-of-towners to get there. Located on the west side of Las Vegas, it's convenient for anyone living in Summerlin or a 5-10-mile radius thereof.   As for the food, I started with the Broccoli Guacamole and gluten-free chips. In an inappropriately hyphenated word, out-of-this-world! Thinly sliced cherry tomatoes kept surfacing into my chips, and the taste of broccoli in every bite was pleasantly unexpected.   My sandwich -- on toasted gluten-free bread that did not flake or fall apart -- was marinated salmon, lettuce, mint, and a very thin layer of Greek yogurt infused with dill. Again, amazing!   For desert, I tried (okay, who are we kidding -- there was no \"tried\" -- only slowly devoured) the Macron... a gluten-free almond powdered biscuit topped with light vanilla cream, strawberry and rhubarb. Again, absolutely delightful looking and tasty.   Fronted by two chefs who last year were named Las Vegas' Best Personal Chefs (the two of them were), and a front-of-the-house manager with multiple business degrees and experience working with chefs across Europe, Eatt is a can't miss for anyone requiring or desiring clean food with flare at affordable prices.",

It's off strip but better quality dishes than MOST of the celebrity chef restaurants on the strip (and I've been to many!). The quality of the ingredients, attention to detail, and complexity of the menu are of the highest standard. Yet, the prices are completely reasonable. There is an excellent list of French wines all for $5/half glass or $10/glass. I had a lovely glass of Merlot but my boyfriend tried several half glasses of various reds and they were all delicious. For dinner, I had the sweet pea soup and eggplant entree. Both were vegan and both were amazing. My boyfriend had borscht, salmon pate choux, and cod confit. We were so full by the end of our meal but ordered dessert to go and the quality was of a French patisserie! The service was so friendly, attentive, and helpful. There was nothing but love and top notch food coming from the kitchen!  Eatt has something for everyone and for prices far more reasonable than on the strip. This restaurant is definitely worth the short Lyft or Uber ride out!",

We were excited to hear that the bottle of wine was half off on Wednesdays! Hence wine Wednesday!!! Our server was very kind. He knew the menu and understood modifications. One of us had a severe dairy allergies and the server spoke to the chef who knew there would be cross contamination with dairy so he made an entirely new dish to accommodate us.   We ordered tuna seared, salmon and tuna thinly sliced filet, beat salad, guacamole, 2 desserts 1 being their special with coconut milk and tapioca, and the other with cream both in martini glasses.   The service was phenomenal and more upscale. They sent out fresh plates for every course, ensured our glasses were always full, and were very elegant and knowledgeable about the ingredients. The staff on their team were quality and carried themselves representing the restaurant well.   Overall I love the entire experience from the service, to the food delivery, steps of service in between, and dessert omg. :)",

Nice ambience,  amazing food,  and great service.  The summer salad blew me away with the flavors and presentation. The green tea dessert is a must.  But my favorite was the ratatouille.  OMG good. Foods served on hot plates and wine service was spot on. Lots of parking and easy to find.   This place is a must try.  On a second dinner last night with foodie friends from Hawaii. Again amazing dinner. The Gazpacho is a must. Our server Jason really made the dinner fun and was so helpful with our friend with a dairy restriction.",

So much effort is put into presentation and taste here that you can't help but photoshoot everything and just admire it and eat it slowly as you continue your adoration for their lovely meals. The service matches this and is pleasant, polite and welcoming. They are a delight, and just opened another sister restaurant so be sure to ask about it and check that out too! I grew up in Vegas and am so happy that now when I visit my hometown I can dine at a place like this for a great price. French food is my top fave and they have Michelin star chefs trained in France in the kitchen making works of art with their meals and desserts. I look forward to being in town again and paying this place another visit.",

However, when we arrived, the restaurant looked more like a lunch place with its drop ceiling and in the corner of a strip mall and there was only ourselves and one other family there. I thought oh oh this is just going to be an average restaurant, but I'd stick in there and find out what it was all about.   Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, wines, and wine pairings. She informed us of the specials as well as other details on the menu such as a five-course dinner with wine pairings.   We ordered the salmon appetizer, my husband ordered the pork shoulder, and I ordered the duck. All were visually stunning and tasted just as good as they looked. The portion sizes were just right...not too big and not too small. They were all items that may be served in a five-star Las Vegas Strip Restaurant. For dessert, we split the pistachio cake.   Also, as our dinner went on for the evening, the tables throughout the restaurant filled in while we were there on a Saturday evening. There is also a chef themed  special  each evening.  For example, Monday is vegan night  and Saturday  is  seafood night. Definitely a place I would recommend.",

As far as the food, we shared so we could tried more. We had the vegan grilled lettuce salad and the salmon & tuna tartare. Then we tried 2 of their specials, a goat cheese & honey toast, and sea bass with Prosciutto ravioli. It's all very fresh, feels very healthy, and absolutely delicious!

I was greeted upon entrance by a friendly young man who was beyond knowledgeable and funny. He sat me at a comfortable table, handed me a menu, and poured me water in a spotless glass while I waited for a friend. I mentioned it was her birthday and that the vegan dessert at the end would be perfect.   When my friend arrived we ordered the broccoli guacamole, the beet salad, the carrots and peas, and the ratatouille (all vegan). We split everything and they actually prepared half portions of everything... beautifully.   My favorite dish was the peas and carrots. It was perfectly seasoned with added crunch in all the mushy perfected goodness.   We ordered was the vegan tapioca balls in coconut milk... graham cracker crumbled and fresh fruit and flower garnish for dessert. Best I've ever eaten!!! I would go back just for this... it was that delicious!   The service was impeccable. Every dish was explained eloquently and in detail upon ordering. All questions were answered and our glasses never went empty. It was probably the best service I've ever had in Vegas... good job guys!   If your looking for a good lunch meet up or a romantic and quiet dinner... definitely bookmark this spot and give it a try!",

    "text": "Everyone should eat healthy food.  Unfortunately,  most folks (like myself) enjoy eating unhealthy food.  Well, the last couple of years, we've been eating healthier more often.  So when my niece chose Eatt Gourmet Bistro to meet, my wife and I were quite excited.  You won't find this charming restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip so don't expect to walk here.  They are worth finding if you like healthy eating.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Food was on the pricey side.  Not a surprise because eating \"clean\" is not cheap.  So how did the food taste?  I liked the Salmon and Tuna Ceviche appetizer which came with gluten free tortilla chips.  For the price, I thought the portion was too small.  Both the Ham & Cheese sandwich and the Salmon sandwich tasted good.  Honestly, though, we make them better at home using healthy organic ingredients as well.    The desserts that we tried had the \"WOW\" factor which I was hoping for.  Make sure to save room for dessert!!  The Exotic was yummy.  The Macaron was divine!  The Cheesecake with Raspberry coulis was exceptional!!  I am guessing that the desserts are not too healthy, but they are the reason I am giving Eatt 4 stars instead of just 3 stars.",

Their staff is almost all entirely from France, or they speak multiple languages. Their courteous respectful and hyper knowledgeable about all their food. If you've ever watched chopped or any of the other incredible cooking shows out there and said yourself while I will never get a chance to eat that avoid it sure does look good... This is the place for you. I had the squash ravioli with a coffee foam and cream top to it. It was absolutely to die for. I could've eaten 10 helpings of that. It is very expensive so be prepared to pony up for the experience and for the food. They have cocktails winds and some beers. But no liquor. The interior is nice with a little outdoor seating with trestles and vines that make it feel very Tuscan. Whatever you do, make sure you ask questions if you don't know what something is on the menu ask the server about it and you'll get to know about the food it's origin and ingredients. Trust me, if you try to replicate some these recipes at home you will fail... Unless you are a top chef :-)",

He was hungrier than I but heaven knows I get my tastebuds involved & I'm in the game. We got the Savory pie appetizer, the Caprese salad, and the special, Lamb in puff pastry with zucchini puree.   Mama likey! Whoever is picking produce has a French fairy godmother at the helm. The heirloom tomatoes and stuffed red pepper make me hate the idea of vegan dinners a whole lot less.   I'm in a lamb phase, this is True. The cut was spectacular, just the right amount of pink. There's a Chinese 5-spice in the puree and au jus and now I want to try everything on the menu. It's those subtle hints that let a gastro gal know the chef likes to play.   We shall return and with appetite!",

    "text": "Easily, hands down one of my favorites restaurants in Vegas.  THE HIGHLIGHTS They were super flexible in adapting the 5 course tasting menu to my pescatarian diet and made sure we didn't have any other dietary restrictions.  The wine pairing went perfectly with the meal; we ended up getting three glasses of white wine, about 8 oz each.  The service was seriously impeccable. Our server was super friendly and warm, knowledgable about the menu, and incredibly attentive. They made sure we enjoyed every dish and slowed down the pace of our meal so we could enjoy our wine (which there was a lot of). I can't overstate how good the service is.  The quality of ingredients, the attention to detail, the presentation, and the flavors are all reasons that make the food amazing.  RECOMMENDATIONS Out of everything, my favorite appetizer was the octopus carpaccio. My favorite entree was the red snapper with zucchini and red pepper puree, and my favorite dessert was the raspberry macaron with lemon cream.  OVERALL The food was deliciously amazing. The wine pairings went perfectly with our meal, and the service only elevated the experience. I definitely, definitely, recommend this place, and I can't want to come back!  TIP: definitely don't skip out on dessert here. The dessert was seriously so good, after trying two, we ordered another to go!",

I am so glad \"Eatt healthy food\" exit and I can totally trust them. I felt like Sheff  Yuri made my dish not for a guest but for a family member. My friend and I shared the broccoli guacamole, which was a great idea. Then I had salmon with beet and sprouts- so delicious. Best housemaid strawberry lemonade I've ever try. And for dessert I picked the pistachio one. You must not leave without tasting it!  Affordable local new place, very modern design, great service and healthy, creative, tasty food. I would Eatt healthy again and again!",

I went to Eatt a few times since their opening, the chefs and the members of the staff are very friendly and always here to give you advices and recommendations about the menu. They also took a few times the initiative to pick an item on the menu like a dessert or a specialty of the chef to introduce me to new flavors. I've never been disappointed so far! The decor of the restaurant is as refreshing as the food Eatt offers. I've found out today they were cooking specials some days, I can't wait to discover them! A great place I've been lucky to find and where I'm always happy to go back!",

    "text": "Wow!  Eatt Gourmet Bistro just introduced a NEW menu with a VEGAN section!  We had the Organic Vegan Cheese house made ravioli (best flavor explosion I've ever tasted in a ravioli).  Also, we shared the Impossible patty, topped and bottomed with herbed hash browns, with candied red onions and avocado mayo!!! Hands down best burger we've had (better than the Beyond Meat burger for sure).  Then dessert - Vegan Chocolate Cake with mango and pineapple filling, with a puffy rice thin crust of sorts - I am generally not a \"mousse\" cake kinda person - but THIS was excellent in texture and taste.  TOP notch. Perfect Portions and superb service.  GET HERE - you will love it!!",

The ONLY mar of our experience is that it took a really long time to order, get food, and get the check, and I and a couple colleagues were having a \"power\" lunch, and had to leave to get back to our respective offices/appointments after approximately 75 minutes, but this was a strictly 90 minute lunch experience (or longer--the table to our left was partaking of something like 3 bottles of wine, lol).  The food is a dream.  My \"Scottish salmon\" was perfect, tender, cooked to a perfect medium, with a creamy cauliflower salad that was instagrammable.  They have interesting and healthful offerings, such as the hibiscus lemonade.  The service--aside from the languorously slow French pace--is superb.  We just need to get this down to a power lunch timeframe, and they WILL get that 5th star.  I will be back.",

    "text": "I sampled Eatt at the Veganfest in Vegas 2018.  They served me a Caprese salad on a french baguette.  They used a locally made vegan mozzarella called Virgin Cheese.  The cheese company was also a vendor there, and told me they make that mozzarella special for Eatt.  It was so creamy, & the perfect texture.  The baguette was the best piece of bread I think I've ever eaten.  I inquired about purchasing more, but they told me they have them imported from France and don't sell to the public.  What really kicked it up a notch though is they topped the whole thing with freeze dried balsamic vinegar.  It was a crispy, flavorful, and textural experience I had never had, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm excited to go back and try their full menu when I visit Vegas again.",

There is really not anything off the mark, except maybe the portion size for the price point. But- well, you save more space to try out their other incredible dishes! 3-4 appetizers/soups per person should be about right. They accommodate dietary restrictions and make some great suggestions to ensure that there are plenty of great vegetarian options to choose from. We ordered a ton of things -  Proencale savory pie, red pepper mousse, Salmon Blinis, which has buckwheat pancake with salmons etc. This place is one of my top picks for vegetarian friendly fine dine restaurants in the country and I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "I decided to take my mom out for thanksgiving the day before,  and I had been wanting to try this place for a while.  I also saw they offered lots of options for people who didn't eat meat,  so my Mom would not have a limited selection.   First impression is I was so glad the restaurant was spacious,  and the tables afforded you a certain level of personal space.  A lot of new trendy restaurants these days sardine you into close quarters, and it's not a comfortable experience.  Here they make a space for you that you can enjoy,  and matches the quality of food you are promised.   Now one fun thing about the menu here is it changes seasonally.  Often I'm not the biggest fan of fall or winter menus.   The items can be heavy, or to sweet, and I'm often searching for an acid to cut through the dish .  The artful way in which everything was prepared this night was balanced and thoughtful.   We began with soups.   We chose to get the smaller portion, which is half the size,  and half the price.  Then we could try two.  I had heard such good things already about their butternut squash soup,  and was highly intrigued by the parsnip,  coconut,  pear soup,  so we chose those from the 4 options.  These two soups told a story, they had a clear perspective, varied texture to keep it interesting on the palate,  and the chef built flavor in an impressive way, especially considering they were vegetarian.  My favorite of the two was the butternut squash,  it was one of the most amazing soups I have very had,  which is surprising because no one has ever made a butternut squash soup I even liked.   Normally they are bland,  yet to sweet,  and just one note in flavor.   This was very savory with its coffee foam,  sateed mushrooms,  robust truffle flavor,  and little buttery croutons that adorned the dish.    For our appetizer we essentially got a very fancy salad.  The beet roll has thinly sliced celery root, yogurt dotting the plate,  thin beets rolled in an artful way encasing tiny little chopped beets, and dressed with a dressing that held just enough acid to cut through the earthy and sweet notes.   It was a master class honestly in knife skills as well.  For our main dishes I got the salmon, while my mother chose the sole.  The salmon dish was so fascinating because it came with a buttered cabbage side.  Basically a very this softened cabbage leaf that held what appeared to be a cabbage mash.  Something I didn't even know could be achieved,  but allowed for the salmon not to weighed down.  The cranberry and Serrano pepper mentioned in the dish were only tasted as whispers on my tounge.   The voulet  they poured over the dish upon serving it mellowed those flavors and was the dominant factor of that dish.   They also crisped what I believe was cabbage in a nori like fashion which created a great salt component.  The fish was still delicate and flaky.   For dessert we could not decide, so we got both the hazelnut profiteroles,  and the vegan chocolate mouse cake with marmalade. Like all their dishes they were works of art.  While hazelnut can be heavy and overbearing,  their creme filling was so light yet rounded in flavor.  The candied hazelnut on top and tempered chocolate gave a great crunch to accompany the airy luscious profiteroles. The chocolate cake was rich and creamy, yet not overly dense.  One of the most impressive vegan desserts I've ever had.  You could taste coconut in place of cream and butter,  but it didn't distract from it like some vegan desserts.   Also the marmalade gave a lovely contrast,  and was not overly sweet. The base was a thin chocolate crust.    I honestly feel this place is one of my new favorite restaurants, and have been telling everyone about my exceptional experience. I'm so excited to return again at least for every seasonal menu change.  They also are open for lunch! Which not many fine dining places offer. I 100 percent feel the cost of the meal was more than worth the quality and skill I got to experience.  Add this spot to your bookmarks stat!",

Even though it was lunch it felt intimate and romantic. French music and quiet ambience even with Bistro half full. Once again, the food was amazing and expertly prepared.  Everything we have ordered here, from soups, salads, entrees and deserts all make you wonder how a place with such fantastic food is not in an overpriced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. The food easily measures up to anything you may find on the Strip. The menu selection made it difficult to choose. The service was great and the food selections came out with proper timing and we never felt rushed to complete a course before the next one. However, the time between courses was expertly timed. The selection of French wines allowed us to expand our wine palate since we are new to old world wines.  French wine only, but it pairs so well with the menu items. This is a can't miss Bistro.  Please give it a try and I'm fairly certain you too will become regulars after your first visit.",

    "text": "Open table reservation was so convenient. We drove down to this French Bistro from Park MGM to taste what they could offer.  It's a nice quiet place and you could say a little romantic for couple like us. Place was neat and inviting when we arrived. Our reservation was actually 7pm but we decided to change it to 5:45 since we have a show to catch up on. We were greeted by the man in front and glady seated us in a nice spot of the restau (we specifically ask via online about standard seating since it would also offer you high seating) and he gave us the menu right away, gave a little introduction on what you'll expect on their menu and they also give you a little highlight of their best foods.  Cons: Lamb wellington wasn't available though I've been planning to order it even few weeks before flying to Vegas. Lamb wellington was one of their best as per Yelp so I've read a lot of good comments about it. Sadly that's not listed under dinner menu.   Pros: Since lamb wasn't available, it gave us options to new tasting experience.  The server suggested the GOAT CHEESE TARTINE as appetizer and just boom!! It was a frenzy of everything in every bite you do. I'm really thankful i trusted him lol. Also the best thing about them is that they would let you know what kind of experience you'll have on your plate.  Entree for me was the DUCK BREAST. It was flavorful, juicy and mouthwatering! Husband had the BEEF HANGER STEAK and he actually said that that's one of his best meal in Vegas (been to Momofuku, Hell's Kitchen) I really also like the pommes dauphin on his BEEF HANGER STEAK it was actually new taste for me!  I also ordered the Hibiscuw tea and yep! Looooove it so much! I just added 3 sugars in it and it really made my throat freshen up.  You have to see my picture! These guys know what they're doing when you say PLATE PRESETATION.  We will surely coming back specially we didn't get to taste their desserts (we we're so full already)  Their serving is enough for you get a happy tummy haha!  Really love this place!",

    "text": "Finally made it to Eatt Bistro after being on the to do list for quite some time. The dining space is bright with colors and lots of light provided by the large windows. Seating is both high top and  regular height tables with the regular ones having very comfortable seat and back cushions.  An outdoor patio is also available. One entire wall is covered in wood and the shelving has a variety of interesting glass bottles. A very cleaver design aspect. The wait staff is friendly and they work as a team helping to clear dishes promptly. Beverage refills were offered without asking.  For lunch we had  Onion Soup, Minestrone Soup, Caprese Sandwich and Tiramisu. Beverages were Ice tea and  hot green tea. The Onion Soup is a traditional french onion with an excellent broth that was not salty. There were plenty of sweet onions and cheese. The bowl size was a large portion.   I chose the Spin the Wheel option with allows a choice of a cup of soup, sandwich, dessert and house made beverage. The Minestrone with a vegetable broth, diced vegetables and orzo pasta was delicious. The Caprese consisted of panini bread, ham, tomato, mozzarella and pesto. The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich was a great combination of flavors. The Tiramisu is served is a cup with layers of flavors and topped with crispy chocolate and coffee streusel. The Spin the Wheel is a great option. It was a full meal and a  good value.  Kudos to the kitchen for using quality products and providing a variety of choices.  Look forward to a return visit.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch. The restaurant is small but very nice and very clean, as well as very warm. The service is very friendly and very attentive. Both my friend and I decided to order entrees. She ordered the sole entree because it came with red rice which she likes. I ordered the salmon entree. Both were delicious. It is important to be aware that the portions are not large. I would say that my salmon was roughly about 3 to 4 ounces. The sides that came with it, which are combinations of ingredients, were all absolutely delicious. Prior to our receiving our entrees, we received a beautiful little appetizer compliments of the chef. It was fantastic. It was a puree of parsnip with a cream on top and it was absolutely fresh and delicious. As it was my friend's birthday, we did choose to order a dessert. We shared their hazelnut cream puffs. This is supposedly one of their signature dishes as per the staff. It comes with three cream puffs and it was delicious.  We also ordered hibiscus tea that was iced and it was delicious. I really like the fact that this is gourmet cooking taken to a higher level with a lot of very healthy options. There are also many vegan options and vegetarian options which all look delicious. I enjoyed my meal and enjoy the ambience and would definitely come back here again. Highly recommended. The prices are moderate.  Part two: I went back the next day with another friend. We went for lunch again. I ordered the parsnip puree soup. It is so incredibly yummy. For my entree, I ordered the squid which is stuffed with pork and on a bed of Farro risotto along with chorizo. It was outstanding! This is a lot heartier than the salmon entree I had the day before. Both entrees are delicious. The salmon entree is just a little less filling than the squid entree. For dessert, we ordered the praline hazelnut cream puffs again. This dessert is so incredibly delicious. One has to try it to understand. This is award-winning! My friend had the same meal that I did and found it just as good. She did order a blue moon beer and I ordered sparkling wine with hibiscus syrup. It was delicious. Another amazing meal. The total for the whole meal for two people with alcohol was $102, including tax. For what we got, this is incredibly reasonable. Once again, highly recommended! This place is great for anyone, yet continues to be outstanding for vegans and vegetarians. The bottom line is that the entree or meal that you order will also predict how full you will be. I mentioned that the portions are not large, but they are not small either. The salmon is a perfect portion for lunch. The squid was hearty and very filling. Unless you are used to massively large portions, the portions here are perfect.  This place is amazing. Hands down, some of the best food in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow! Excellent off-strip gem for delicious French inspired cuisine owned and operated by owners and Chef from France.   We had a delicious dinner here from start to finish! Highly recommend everything we ordered and we'll certainly be back to try other dishes.  We started with the artichoke & burrata and the beef carpaccio. Both were fantastic. The artichoke dish had a good sized portion of burrata which was a nice surprise. I order beef carpaccio or steak tartare every time it's on a menu so I'm equipped to tell you that this one was wonderful. The chef added little bits of smoked eel which I hadn't seen done before. If you didn't know it was eel, you wouldn't have noticed so don't let that detract you from ordering this delicious appetizer.  For entrees we had the Lamb Wellington which was cooked perfectly and was very yummy and the Salmon. The salmon was also cooked perfectly and was a high quality piece of fish. The nicest surprise on the plate was the spinach ravioli which I expected to be stuffed w/minced up spinach and cheese. Instead, it was stuffed with only fresh spinach! A delightful bite of fresh spinach and house made ravioli as an accompaniment to a beautiful piece of fish.  Sadly, we were too full for dessert. The service was good, quick and efficient.  We can't wait to return. They are also open for lunch which we'll certainly come back for as well.  Before you head to the Strip for a $300 plus French meal, check out this cozy little gem. You won't regret it.",

I feel like there's a preconceived notion that healthy food either doesn't taste good but looks good or vice verse, and Eatt has proven that you can have both.   This place is both lovely and relaxing an I have enjoyed coming in here after my workouts. I have not been disappointed or underwhelmed with the flavors. They know very well how to make something healthy but not make it taste like it, and I love that.   The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I feel like I'm underdressed every time I walk in. I understand it is a bistro. But they depict themselves as being casual. So when I come in after the gym I feel like I should be wearing my brunch clothes. However, they are super sweet to me and the main guy has been very hospitable  Honorable mention. I love their lemon ginger tea!   Happy Eating!",

    "text": "How often do we eat at well-established restaurants (expensive ones, usually) and after the meal agree that one dish shined above the rest?  We agree that while the appetizer was good, we may not order it again.    It is the rare restaurant where the entire experience leaves me saying at the end of the meal, \"Ya know if you put that proverbial gun to my head, I really couldn't tell you which dish I liked best.  They were all superb.\"    From my meal tonight:  Melon rolled around prosciutto with balsamic watermelon.  The melon not too sweet, the prosciutto not too salty, presented as a beautiful flower on my plate, easy to eat, and simply balanced.  Baguettes with goat cheese and caramelized onions.  The right heaviness of the bread, the right balance of sweetness of onions to the not too salty goat cheese.  A perfectly poached piece of king salmon surrounded with ravioli stuffed with spinach and cheese.  Ravioli cooked al dente in the right amount of salt water; cheese that accented but did not take away from the natural flavors of the spinach or pasta; and a delicate foam that added but didn't overpower the beautiful piece of fish.  Dessert:  As tasty as it was pretty -- Light as air pistachio mousse with raspberry fillings, fresh raspberries and a cookie with just the right amount of salt to contrast the simple sweeter flavors.    I often say that Vegas is a gambling and drinking town that only pretends to be a food town.  Not so with this gem off the strip.  It was a lovely experience, casual, unrushed dining, and sophisticated food that left me satisfied but not ridiculously full.  Wait staff professional, friendly and extremely helpful, too.  GO!",

Each of us chose the wild salmon entry that was marinated in miso and served with beets, apple and soy sprouts.  For dessert, we settled on classic creme brulees that proved to be larger than expected so we would likely share one next time.  This proved to be the best meal of our 14 day vacation in Las Vegas.",

The chocolate cake was also one of a kind.  But I won't ruin the surprise - you'll have to come and find out for yourself.    So be adventurous. Try something new. You'll be amazed by Eatt!",

Each side and entrees of the lunch menu look very good, but if you ask me to make a choice (what is very difficult) I will say that I prefer the Butternut soup and the chicken wrap  \"What about the dessert ?\" Amazing too but my favorite one is the Tapioca !  The dinner menu was crazy too, and I finally choosed the Gaspacho very fresh and sweet. And after the piece of Black Angus (and because I am a meat amator) there is no word to describe how tasty and perfect was the beef.   The red wine selection is perfect too.  This healthy and gourmet restaurant is a very nice place which diserve the five stars on Yelp. Thank you and congrats to all the team for this 3 exceptionnal moments. I think I m gonna make a new break to take a Lunch in this place.  Je recommande of course !",

    "text": "I am forever grateful for the incredible food I just had at EATT, seriously it is worth coming here! I have passed this place many times while I'm on Sahara and never really got to stop by until today. I honestly did not know what to expect and the only thing I can think of is I'm hungry.  On the corner of Buffalo and Sahara, you will find EATT near CVS pharmacy. It's actually in the Sahara Hart Plaza and parking is shared by other establishments. I came around dinner time and it wasn't hard to find parking because there is plenty available.  Inside it looks fancy and modern. I love how they include light furnishing, comfortable seating, soft color, clean and simple design, and earthy decor. When I see plants everywhere, it gives me the impression that this restaurant focus a lot more on healthy eating. Ryan who was the server, brought the menu and informed me of today's special. He asked if there was anything else I'd like to drink aside from water. By the way, their water is infused with lemon. They offer a wine list, alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks. They also have homemade beverages like hibiscus, strawberry lemonade, and when I saw Lemon Ginger Iced Tea ($3) that's what I went for. This drink has a light lemon and a subtle hint of ginger flavor, it really helps cool down the body and it taste refreshing.  They have an awesome selection for their Summer Menu and I ordered the Gazpacho Chilled Soup ($12), which is a delicious and flavorful creamy tomato soup, there's a nice crunch from the cucumber and red pepper, and it's served in a beautiful stone bowl. It comes with a side of crispy garlic stick bread that has a light spread and garnished with cherry tomatoes and celery. What's cool is they offer a little variety for everyone, so if you want a meat entree they have chicken, beef, pork, duck, cod, lobster and salmon. They also have a great menu option for Vegans.   For appetizer, I got the Summer Salad ($16) which is beautifully plated with vibrant color and mixture of fresh crisp kale & arugula, beets, grape tomatoes, thinly sliced apple, mung bean sprouts, avocado, citrus, sesame seeds & lychee dressing. Every ingredient in the Summer Salad taste amazing and it's all fresh! The light sweetness of lychee dressing complemented so perfectly with apple, avocado, and citrus. I can already imagine how this will taste great in a smoothie! I highly recommend getting the Summer Salad, it's definitely powered with vital nutrients and the flavor is remarkable.   After dinner I thought Ryan was going to bring a small menu for dessert. Instead he brought a huge black board to my table haha, with four dessert options. I opt for Chocolate Tart ($9). Ryan said that is an excellent choice and I absolutely agree! When you try this dessert, it will make you feel like falling in love. It's served as a crunchy chocolate cookie tart that's filled with creamy chocolate and chantilly cream and covered with a thin crisp chocolate candy and salted caramel sauce. It has a perfect blend of salt and sweetness and I probably could eat just half of this delicious treat. For sure it can be shared for two and it is a definite must-have for dessert. My tummy is so happy, I'm stuffed with the most amazing food! Thank you EATT for the wonderful hospitality, beautiful presentation, excellent flavor, and for your personable service. Great place for everyone to come and enjoy!",

I wish i would've order this as the lunch instead of going with the special (soup, sandwich, dessert). Caprese sandwich was really fatty and chewy (not in good way).  Deconstructed tiramisu was okay to pointless.  I'm not sure what you're trying to do here.  Drink.  Basic iced tea was flavorless and nearly colorless.  I had to ask for a new one that had you know, tea in it.  Overall.  If it was closer I would give it another try but this is really nothing special and not worth the even the short drive to investigate.  Disappointing since this is the same owners of Partage which if fabulous.",

I love that... to me that means I am getting the freshest food available!  This last visit I had a lobster salad that wasn't quite on the menu yet... we came just as the menu was changing.  That lobster salad was amazing!!! I hope they can keep that one for a while. Delicious!",

Due to unplanned traffic issued and the need to get to a performance that night we only had 45-mins.  The staff was very helpful and did a fantastic job of getting our order and then pacing the meal to accommodate.  We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (1/2-price bottles for $60 and over bottles on Wednesdays) Goat Cheese Tartine appetizer, and their two specials for the evening, Ribeye Steak and the Dover Sole.  Everything was artfully plated when it arrived and the taste was as good as it looked.  We will definitely return but this time not wait so long.",

I was in a party of three, started with the summer salad which was fresh and tasty.   Two of us got the Scottish king salmon with miso sauce, one of us got the Chicken Breast entree.   The salmon was a small cut, well seasoned and very good. Served on a bed of tabouleh. I've added photos.   I think because last night I had this same type of salmon at another place and it was absolute perfection, I need to be careful not to under-estimate the piece I had here.  My friend who had the chicken, reported it was spectacular.  We also bought two different dessert options to share, the lemon cake and the dark chocolate offering. WOW! So many textures, smooth, mousses, crunch, sauces, fresh fruit. So good!!! It's worth coming here for the desserts even if you didn't want dinner.  The place appears to be really clean, including the restroom. It's tastefully decorated in minimalist fashion which we liked.   Our waiter, Ryan, did a great job of providing information on the specials that weren't on the menu, being efficient about getting our order, and staying mindful of checking in with us from time to time without it being too much.   We really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back.",

There are daily specials and a wonderful menu that changes seasonally.  There are also a variety of gluten-free and vegan items, so there is something to please everyone.  The interior is clean and contemporary but does not feel cold or industrial thanks to the small and well thought out details.    Service was outstanding.  Justin and Jessica (or Jessa?) were welcoming, informative, and super friendly without being over the top. The food was exceptional. The menu is a testament to how eating healthy doesn't have to be without choices or flavor.   My party had the sea bass with locally sourced carrots and apricot puree, a small salad, and the lamb sandwich. Everything was cooked perfectly, the presentation was fantastic, and the flavors were divine.  We tried the Hibiscus Tea which was very flavorful.  I felt the prices were very good and absolutely more than competitive with other places considering the exceptional quality.    I can't wait to add Eatt on my rotation for my visitors and to return again soon for a delicious and healthy meal!",

I had a soup (Parsnip) that had a combination of sweet and salty it had perfect balance, I truly don't know how to be more descriptive about a soup, it was just so incredible, plus my boyfriend says their French onion is to die for.  I will say if you are worried about portion size because... well, America has spoiled us now hasn't it?

Our server was nice, attentive and although the decor is not as \"nice\" as Partage, the food imo was better.  We both got the tasting menu and we enjoyed every dish, but here were the stand-outs:    - Gazpacho! This was refreshing and bright and I normally don't like soup, but I would have this again and again.    -Crab salad. I am not a fan of salads, but crab meat salad....guess i'm a fan :) My coworkers fave dish was the crab salad.    - Duck...oh the duck. THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! It was cooked perfectly and the crust on the outside was perfect....writing this review is making me drool thinking back to the duck.    - Praline Cream Puff was a great way to end the meal. It was delish and I gobbled it all up.  The food you get for the price you pay is well worth it. It is fine dining food at a fraction of the cost. I would come back here the next time I am in Vegas.",

We sat on their comfortable dining chairs on the other side. There were 4 tables of couples seated when we were there. Surely it means on the pricier side LOL!  Actually I prefer quality over quantity, prices are little high but compared to the Strip and the quality of the food it's reasonable. Their food are healthy and they have vegan and gluten free options as well.  Their friendly, professional waiter sold us on one of the appetizer specials called Vol-au-vent. It's a small round case of puff pastry filled with a savory mixture, and shrimp in a delectable richly flavored sauce. I ordered Duck leg salad as my entree which was nice but we both loved Pork more, so simply delicious and flavorful. For deserts, we had Pistachio cake. Everything was light but with an explosion of flavors. The presentation of the meal were exquisite.  This restaurant was one the most amazing and impressive food and flavor I have had experienced in a very long time. The waitress who also waited on our table was  very sweet and helpful. I would recommend to anybody for a special occasion.",

One minor note is that the lighting could be a bit dimmer i.e it was a bit over-bright. But that's a minor thing.",

Definitely worth the short drive from the strip if you're visiting, and a must if you're a local. We got hooked on our first visit and kept going back. You can eat your way through the entire menu and love every single dish. From appetizers to entrees and desserts, their food is Michelin star-worthy without the Michelin star prices :) Every dish tells a story and you'll want to come back for more. Oh, and did I mention their specials!? They'll have at least one special waiting for you to try every day. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super nice and friendly. Nicolas is a sweetheart!

We decided to try the vegan options (Impossible burger and Moussaka). The Impossible burger was amazing! The Moussaka had delicate pieces in between that made the dish. They also have some handmade (non-alcohol) drinks that are quite tasty! The service was friendly and prompt. Personally, I'd rebrand it (atmosphere, logo, etc.) a bit and I'd think it could push more notoriety, word of mouth, and traffic. Nonetheless, if you want a fine dining meal quality at a good price and friendly smile, great place!",

The waiter told us the cheese plate was locally sourced which is always nice and very tasty even for my non vegan friends. It comes with plenty of bread and a nice balsamic glaze. The risotto was just okay wish it was better. It was nicely plated but overall bland taste. They also put a piece of vegan cheese on top....the sliced kind not grated which is what I expected. It reminded me of putting cheese slices on my spaghetti as a kid and not something I'd see in a restaurant. I didn't complain and ate it happily but I took off a star for taste. My friend had the Salmon and butternut squash soup. She loved it and I tried some of the soup which was good. Would I come back absolutely. I love trying new vegan restaurants and encourage everyone to give them a try. happy veganuary!!",

I was surprised at the price, but it sounded good so I ordered it. When I opened it to eat it after leaving I saw that I had ONE RAVIOLI in the soup?! Yes I knew it was a soup but she had talked up the ravioli and I never would have expected to only have one included. I am extremely upset bc I feel like I really wasted my money. Won't be a returning customer.",

The service was ok but we did not appreciate the fact that the waiter was trying to sell way more expensive wine when we already picked the wine from the menu. It was annoying, especially when we asked about the price for the wine that he suggested and he was avoiding to answer. The reason was the his wine was at least 2 times more expensive.",

Eatt was understated but comfortable and it's easy cafe nature conceals an incredible experience for any True 'foodie'. I have eaten in Michelin rated restaurants, met and dined with chef Rubuchon, and experienced every notable restaurant in vegas... that being said- Eatt was genuinely one of the most memorable and impressive meals I have encountered in a long time. The food has an amazing balance of texture and flavor for a trained palette or someone who just enjoys a simple good meal. I can't say enough about this restaurant except go as quickly as you can. I just came back home from NYC feeling sad about the lack of dining experiences here that really engage me but then I found Eatt and I have been telling everyone about it!!! I would give 10 stars if I could!",

I was looking for something healthy and interesting.  Just when I was about to give up on my search and head out to get a salad at Sweet Tomato, I hit \"browse more\" one more time and finally the perfect place appeared --- Eatt Healthy!!! I read a few reviews, grabbed my husband and we were off.  The food was awesome!  I had scallops and my husband had angus beef. The  scallops were served with a tender & flavorful ravioli and the the steak came with their signature ratatouille rolls. The presentation was colorful and interesting.  The service was a bit slow but it gave me time to visit with my husband and unwind from a stressful week.  I highly recommend \"Eatt Healthy\".  The portion sizes are adequate and you will have room for dessert -- which are delightful!!",

    "text": "Just WOW.  Came here at the suggestion of a (foodie) friend. The place is so unassuming and generic outside that we almost passed... what a mistake that would have been!  My daughter had the salmon blinis, and I had gazpacho to start; both beautifully presented and very nice flavours; both decent portion sizes.  She went on to have the filet special; I chose a tartine of goat cheese, pecans and caramelised onion with some magically puffed honey. Oh and the bread is flown in par baked from Paris and is the bomb! We ended with the macaron with apple, and chocolate cake.  I can honestly say that this was in the top five meals I've eaten in my fifty four years, and I have travelled to fifty states and been blessed to have eaten in many very chic and upscale restaurants.  Our server was lovely and prompt. The owner introduced himself and I wished him great success. This is a place you'll be glad to say you went to when it's impossible to get a reservation due to popularity in a few months!  The inside is charming and simple, almost a farmhouse vibe. Do not sit in the parking lot and wonder... get in and EATT!",

Then we all ordered the octopus, which came from Spain - very tender. It was the best octopus I had in several years; done properly with a mixture of vegetables that accompanied it exquisitely. Then of course, coffee and dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake and chestnut creme puff. It was heaven without it being overwhelmingly sweet. We were so happy with the food that we ordered sandwiches to go: the cured ham panini, a vegetable one and a tuna sandwich. The panini had a pesto sauce and mozzarella. Delicious! And the prices were very affordable for the quality of food. The chef even came out to check-in with everyone to see if the food was to their liking. Very professional, including the staff. The interior of the place is clean and modern. So don't let the unassuming exterior fool you - this place is a GEM in Las Vegas. Enjoy!",

The food is modern French and is bursting with flavor.  Whether a not so simple salad or a complete dinner the dish will have the real taste of the ingredients. I have had the beef and chicken dinners , quiche and salads. All excellent. The baguette is superb as are the creative pastries. I have also found the owners and staff to be very warm and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I highly recommend for lunch or dinner.",

They let you spin a wheel to win a prize (free coffee for a week, free drink, free dessert, etc for example) if your order over $20 I believe it is.  The only thing I felt sad about is the portion size... Although realistically that's just because I'm used to American portion sizes being more than what we should have.  I believe the chef and manager are French, so it makes sense why they use smaller portion sizes. I'm a 110 lb girl and the salmon entree was a perfect size for me to eat for lunch, but I don't think it'd fill up a man's appetite.",

We started with the butternut squash veloute with truffle oil, asian mushrooms & coffee foam.  It was creamy, earthy and delicious. Then we had the Tielle appetizer. It's a French pastry (pictured on the right) with vegetables, capers, olives, herbs, tomato sauce and a whole lot of yummy!  Along with that (pictured on the left) was the Pot Au Feu, a well rounded vegetable broth filled with stuffed cabbage, chickpea and beautiful tiny vegetables. I told the chef we were coming for my birthday a few days ago and he prepared a very special desert for me as you can see in the 2nd picture. It was the most amazing birthday dessert I've ever enjoyed and we devoured it!  It was a black currant poached pear filled with chocolate mouse, surrounded by dark chocolate rings, and a crunchy crumble dusted the plate to create a perfect bite every time.  You have to take your friends and loved ones here if you'd like to enjoy a Five Star neighborhood restaurant that treats each person like a part of the family. Go, Eatt, live!",

I am a BIG fan of everything FRENCH. French lover, French language and definitely French cooks/food.   They focus on glutin free items and dishes and have vegan options as well. Tastey, light and healthy well portioned dishes. Ohhhh and then to add love for your sweet tooth they have a lovely selection of deserts to finish off your meal.   The service is excellent and attentive as they take pride in their food and all over business and you can really see that.   Nice clean fresh feeling simplistic minimal designed space.   A++",

    "text": "10 stars! Thank you for bringing us a great experience and for bringing such a concept to Las Vegas - french fare with elegance and care in a casual atmosphere and friendly service!  Everything tasted so good and made with such love and care! We were wowed by all the exquisite presentations and different methods of cooking. Our butternut veloute had delicious coffee foam on top, the salmon was cooked medium rare to perfection with a variety of vegetables to complement, the duck breast was so tender and juicy and went really well with the sweet potato puree, and my goodness the desserts were bomb - cream puffs that tasted like Ferrero rocher and exotic coconut mousse green tea pastry with passion fruit coulis. The only lackluster dish was the cabbage stuffed chicken. We all tried it and agreed it was just alright. Their salmon and duck breast were amazing though so order the right stuff! Oh oh forgot to mention, their raw oysters were one of the best we've had! The manager said they're from Japan but we forgot to ask which kind. They made an excellent mignonette, just like how the French do it of course. (I wish they actually spell out this word on the menu so people learn this word instead of tabasco! I have respect for oysters.) on top of that they even made a mini pancake with whipped cream and dill on top to complement the oysters! That was amazing!!!  Service was very friendly. The manager and chef came to greet and talk to us, and our server gave food recommendations and knew exactly was in the food and where they came from. It's definitely a Michelin star experience without the Michelin price tag!  I cannot say enough how much all 4 of us loved this restaurant. When it gets busy, hope we can still make a reservation the next time we come in!!!   C'est delicieux! Merci beaucoup!",

The salmon was so tender and favorable. It was cooked perfectly for medium rare. It was the best salmon entree we ever had! The two desserts gave us a lasting sweet memory. Again they were the best we ever had!  My husband's lamb Wellington was cooked just right. Mine was cooked a bit more than I liked. It was a little gamey and the puff pastry was not as crispy as I would like it to be. However, we enjoyed the whole experience and the ambience!  The value we got from the food over its price was exceptional. The presentation and quality exceeded many high-end expensive restaurants.  Eatt will be a place we will come back when we are in town and will be highly recommended to our friends and families.",

The perfect Las Vegas menu combo would include a salmon sandwich, butternut squash soup, with tiramisu and raspberry lemonade.  The menu changes frequently and was told it would change again towards the end of April. I'm excited go come back to try the new menu in the future.  Definitely should try this place out if you are in the area.",

The beef carpaccio with caviar was stunning. Butternut squash soup was OMG-status. I got to try all of the entrees that were offered thanks to having 4 people in my party. Octopus was my favorite - perfectly tender with the right amount of flavor. And the desserts...which I also got to try 4 different ones. My favorite was the cream puff, which is what the chef is known for. But the passion fruit dessert comes in at a close second. I like lighter desserts and that one was a dream come True. The right balance of sweet and tart. What a great little find. Don't expect bells and whistles but that's exactly why I love this place. And my entire party agrees. MUST TRY!",

You expect just your run of the mill health spot with the name, but the meal is lavishly presented with great ingredients and tasty options. Prices are a $1 or $2 higher than its health counterparts, but it really is prepared to amaze with the colors and dish alignment   I can for a quick lunch during the week and was immediately seated as the restaurant was virtually empty before noon. I ordered the salmon sandwich and the butternut soup. The sandwich came with a few slices of thin salmon and built in veggies; very good but not immediately better than anywhere else in town. The butternut soup was excellent. A True yellow color with mushrooms and fantastic croutons on the inside.   My entire meal was about $15 after tax. You will be full with an order like this but might be a little small for a True lunch if ordering just one of the items mentioned above. I recommend EATT to anyone who wants an upscale experience and food preparation at very affordable prices.",

The prices are not even that expensive considering the quality they put into display and flavor of each plate. Our server was very amicable and was informative about the choices on the menu. We started off with Summer Salad which was basically artsy slices of cantaloupe inserted with few chunks of watermelon and topped with balsamic chips...BALSAMIC CHIPS!!! Seriously worth the try. And then the main course: I was pleased with my plate which was chicken breast with grilled ratatouille atop a zucchini puree. Yum!! May I say that those cubes of white meat were soft and tender for chicken breast! Our dessert was Macaron (light lemon cream and fresh raspberries) and Exotic (Matcha Tea Biscuit with coconut mousse and passion fruit caramel) ok this one was pleasantly light but was also packing with flavor I almost cried.   Overall I'm so happy I got to visit this restaurant. Very clean surroundings including the bathroom. Bright ambience. Light to digest foods. I left feeling healthy haha. Can't wait to be back!",

I immediately  brought me back to a small corner bistro in the middle of France that I haven't seen since my travels overseas. I had to force myself to stop at 3 plates  of small, well executed dishes.   The arugula  salad was fantastic! toasted pine nuts sent this dish over the edge! The beet salad...brilliant! loved the addition of bean sprouts, which i can say...I'll gladly be stealing for my beat salads at home!  finally...The Quiche Lorraine...great balance of flavors.

It's hard to eat out and eat healthy, but not when you come to Eatt Gourmet Bistro!  Let's talk about presentation. A++ here at Eatt Gourmet! They have some incredible menu items and specials that are always fresh and tasty and unique. Just look at the above pics! I love quiches for lunch, and that has been my go-to order here, and it's always served with a fresh little side salad and yummy light dressing.   Portion sizes run a little small, but you're paying for quality food :) Definitely recommend this place!   Decor is clean and modern. Service is super friendly and professional.

You can tell that everything here is prepared with love and care, and attention to detail is certainly here.   I came here on a Saturday morning with two friends, and the menu was explained in its entirety to us, and everything sounded so tasty. We definitely over-ordered, but everything we sampled was outstanding. We ordered two of the savory French toast topped with smoked salmon and a poached egg, followed by the chicken pot au feu, my duck with vegetables, the seafood pasta, and a steak. To finish the meal, we had the tapioca pudding, and the praline puffs. Everything was beyond what I would have thought from a place located in a small plaza.   I've been patiently waiting for a holiday or birthday to come up so I can bring all of my friends and family here. Easily will be my favorite restaurant in Vegas for 2017!",

For dessert I got the raspberry macaron (also amazing)! Here is the reason for the docked star. It was SO hot inside the restaurant , I asked them if the air was on and they said it was as low as they could get it . At the end of the meal I was dripping sweat because it was that hot . They need to fix their air or get a new unit because when it's 110 outside I don't want to sit in a restaurant that's 85 degrees .  Also the ceviche was served with tortilla chips from a bag  you could get from the grocery store, it wouldn't be tough to make them their own or make a plantain chip .  Overall I say GO here, but make sure the air is working .",

The menu was very limited, so if you're looking for options I wouldn't recommend it.    I ordered the salmon wrap and regretted it.  It is cured and the mayo used doesn't compliment the texture.  I did send it back and ordered the ham and cheese sandwich.  Warning: The ham and cheese sandwich is literally ham, cheese, and bread.  It is not warmed up, it is cold, and tastes like a 3rd grader made it.  The best part of this lunch experience was the tiramisu.    I'm writing this because it could be great, has potential, but they do need to add some things to the menu.  Possibly a new chef.  Love the concept, service was great, the food just needs some love! I'll be back!",

I got the pork tenderloin which was a fascinating mix of flavors and items mixed with one another from the mixture of a pea puree with the sweet onion-filled filo. I also got their take on a mini-cheesecake. Although I still prefer a regular cheesecake, it reminded me more of a very light and hollow cake filled with jelly once you open it up. Super creative and interesting.  +Also got the cocktail which was a homemade raspberry syrup mixed into champagne which was solid.  +One other food point about the food, the presentation is on point and thoughtful. Loved their take on the jelly-filled cheesecake where it oozed out upon breaking it open. +Personally think the pricing is not too pricey at around $15+ for the entree. With a drink and dessert, it came out to around $40.  Menu items seem to vary from appetizers to sandwiches/salads/entrees/desserts. There's also an interesting spin-the-wheel option that is like a combo deal of random items which was interesting. +Decor is super clean/modern.  +Not too busy at all on a Friday around noon. Was able to easily get a seat.  +Staff is super friendly and informative. The server (sorry, forgot your name!) was very helpful in choosing the right dishes.   +Parking seemed pretty plentiful if you drive. (I came by Lyft from the Vegas Strip which is about a 20-minute drive.)  All-in-all, would love to come back whenever I'm in town. :)",

First, I had to call and find out if they had TVs because my husband *had* to watch some football game (don't get me started). Jessica who answered the phone said they usually leave them off at night but that she would turn one on to the game for my high maintenance husband.   When we arrived, the game was indeed on and we got a table where the hubs could watch the Kansas City Chiefs crush the Chargers while sipping his Pinot Noir. Cool. Next up, our server Alex.  Alex is hilarious and a totally nice dude. He made great recommendations for us on the meal. I went with the vegan options and they were bomb dot com (nobody says that anymore but IDC). I regret not doing the five course tasting menu because the food was THAT good. I ordered the vegan dessert even though I was kind of \"meh\" about the idea of dark chocolate with mango and pineapple but it was SO delicious.   My husband had some seafood soup first - he loved it. Then the deconstructed veggie burger with potato hash bun - which was unreal good. We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas!!",

    "text": "I've been to this place about 10 times and all I have to say is I LOVE EATT ! I really enjoyed the Summer menu and I now like the Winter menu as well.  Former Michelin star chef Yuri and pastry chef Vincent from L'Oustau de Baumaniere in Les Baux de Provence, France opened this restaurant with Nicolas the funny manager who has been on TV ;)))) and now Aymeric, another French chef.  Every dish from the appetizers, entrees to the deserts is first of all a huge pleasure for the eyes and nose. The presentation is outstanding and the smell with the mixture of flavors and spices extremely invited to try and eat everything.  The lunch time offers quiches and salads too and all kind of light options that will fill you until dinner time. Grab and go available. They have homemade drinks like unsweetened raspberry lemonade and iced-teas.  For dinner my favorites are the butternut veloute soup with mushroom ravioli and coffee foam that had a rich nutty flavor.  They had for the summer a tartine with cherry tomatoes, burrata (creamy mozzarella cheese) and basil pesto that was so fresh and we could taste the best quality olive oil they use. Now the winter option is a roasted goat cheese with candied pecan nuts, onions and honey tartine. Delicious as well, honey and goat cheese are such a good combination !  They serve also chicken pot-au-feu, grilled salmon cooked to your taste, duck, all high standard ingredients that are just prepared to perfection. They also offer vegetarian and vegan options.  Deserts : you have to have'em all !!! The puff pastry that is called Paris-Brest in France, soft crunchy crust and creamy praline feeling, the exotic which combines coconut mousse with passion fruit caramel on a green tea biscuit, just to live for, and the traditional cheesecake. Be sure that you never had a real cheesecake before you tried this one. I prefer the one in the Summer with raspberry than the Winter one with tangerine but stil is very good.  Nice wine list to pair any of those dishes.  The portions are smaller than American standards but fits perfectly what you expect from that kind of high quality food and it's so filling that you couldn't eat more anyway. Just appreciate every bite.  Thank you Eatt for giving us the opportunity to get fine, exquisite, healthy and affordable French food off the Strip, just around the corner.",

Everyone working at this restaurant was very friendly and personable.  Flavors were spot on - we tried the broccoli guacamole, salmon club sandwich, chicken entree, and the beet salad. Each dish was creative and delicious. A bit too many sprouts in the beet salad, but still very good. We were not impressed that some items came out on china and others in to go containers - this took away from the overall seated dining experience. To go containers should only be used to go. My husband's meal in to go containers came out so far in advance of my meal (on plates), that he was finished before my food even arrived.   For desert, we tried the cheese cake and another desert (I'm not sure of the name) with coconut and a matcha biscuit on the bottom. So good! We loved the smaller bites - not really desert people, but these looked too good not to try and they did not disappoint. Delicious!! Can't say that word enough times!  As a new business, we are sure there are some kinks to be worked out, but over all we were very pleased and will definitely be back!",

If you're into eating clean , light and healthy inspired by French technique by a team that have come from Paris and south of France come here ,or best yet have them come to your home and use your kitchen . Either way the food is just perfect with a lots of flavors,  not salty , not oily , just fresh and clean eating   . Note: Try the chicken.",

I have not tried their pastries yet however, I have not forgotten what I saw.",

Unfortunately it ended up being a giant waste of money. It really was way too pricey for what it was. We ended up spending $70 for what was essentially deli food on an IKEA plate. The water had floaters in it. The coffee tasted like it came out of a keurig. It was just not worth it at all. 2 stars for the decor and overpriced tiramisu.",

I admit that I was ready to be disappointed. We ordered the salmon sandwich, ratatoille rolls, broccoli guac, and the zucchini. EVERYTHING. WAS. SO. GOOD.  I feel like you have to leave American expectations at the door with this place. No, its not quite what you're used to. And yes, that's a very good thing.

It's fabulous and the owners and staff are all very enthusiastic.  I've been twice by myself and then brought my husband, who loved it as well.  It's Euro portioning, which is just perfect for me since I can't shake that very unhealthy \"clean your plate\" mentality.  So if you're a big eater, like my husband, you might want to try a few things.  It's not expensive, so not a big deal that the portions aren't huge.  They did a great job with clean and casual decor.",

Lesson to self: never judge a book by its cover! Really cool place inside! Super modern and clean, wait staff was extremely gracious and helpful with the menu. Perfect spot for a date night! They have specials daily, offer cooking classes and have a jazz night with a prix fixe menu... Salmon blinis to start, a lamb special (amazing) and a steak with mashed potatoes/balsamic reduction. We also ordered a ceasar salad which was one of the BEST we've ever had. *Not really portioned for sharing*, but such amazing flavors!  They don't have a kid friendly menu, but chef completely accommodated ours by making chicken sliders! Just a caution though: if you're going in starving, you will be hungry when you leave!",

    "text": "Sometimes you go to a place and you feel so good about the experience that you want to go back ASAP and bring friends. Then, you go the second time and it is an unmitigated disaster. That was my experience with Eatt. My first stop was with my wife on July 6. We arrived at the opening, were seated by friendly staff with whom we were immediately able to establish a great rapport. We had a magnificent meal - I particularly loved the octopus carpaccio, my wife the gazpacho and the Tuna and salmon carpaccio. We both had a wonderful fish dinner - no dessert, the portions were sufficient, not too much not too little. The list of beers available is limited - none of which I'd rate superior, but in a pinch, I can drink a Stella. They have a few good, wines but the focus of the place is not the wine list - but the food and it was simply marvelous. I could say nothing but good things about it and started recommending it to everyone I spoke to. So ... we went back with friends on July 15. BIG difference in the quality of the food and atmosphere. We arrived at 6:30 instead of 5.00 PM. There was already a sizeable party seated and partaking in their dinner and drinks.  Let's say the table had 14 to 18 people. There were other tables already occupied. The wait staff was overwhelmed. Friendly, sure. But it seemed to me that there was the same number of waitstaff for about 30 people as there had been for half that number. And the service suffered for it. Additionally, the air-conditioning either was off completely, broken or so mal-functional that sweat was literally rolling off the top of my bald head. Yes, it is Las Vegas, and yes when you are seated in a place that has a large window facing West (even though covered) you expect it to be warmer than someplace else, but I don't enjoy going out for dinner and sweating. (Vegas restaurants are usually cold so I wear an undershirt as well as a shirt to make sure I am warm enough.) I ordered the octopus carpaccio, my wife again the gazpacho and the octopus carpaccio as a main. One of our friends ordered the octopus carpaccio as an appetizer. For the main, I ordered the filet of sea bass. I had two forkfulls of the octopus carpaccio and noticed - not the same. It wasn't the moist, fresh tasting appetizer of a few days before. My friend noticed as well that the fish was dry. I figured I'd be able to remedy the situation by getting some olive oil.  It took so long to get noticed (we were seated pretty much in the middle of the restaurant with four people trying to flag waitstaff) that everyone else had practically finished their appetizer by the time I managed to speak to a waiter. I was so agitated that the waiter suggested he bring it back to the kitchen. It finally arrived with the requested olive oil - and by the time everyone else was done with their first course. By now my wife wasn't looking forward to the carpaccio as the main. (My friend had finished his because he was not going to wait too long.) Restauranteurs - if you are going to have a table with a large number of guests, don't have the same number of waitstaff that you have for a normal evening. If you have three people working the tables, you cannot have two maintaining things for the larger party leaving one to rush for the others. My main arrived - and while not \"cold\" it certainly wasn't hot. The underlying mousse substance probably could have been tastier had it been warmer. My fish (surely not the 8 ounces I was expecting) seemed like it just came out from under a heat lamp. In short, my main was more or less tasteless. TASTELESS. Fortunately, they had brought some olive oil out for my wife's carpaccio - also dry, and I was able to put some on top of my fish - so my main did get some flavor, from the olive oil. (Which - was very good!) I wanted to leave, but my friends had their hearts set on macarons. We stayed. The description of the cheese cake sounded good, so I took that - and it was somewhat redeeming. But all and all - a tremendous disappointment. Since the place is three minutes by car from my home, I was looking forward to a place to just go to when we don't want to cook for ourselves. I am reevaluating my thinking. I still will gush over the first visit - which I would rate four stars - and will recant this episode as well to all who will listen. One thing is for sure - IF I ever walk through their doors again and there is a party table, I will turn right around and walk out. A shame really.",
