    "text": "I am currently a vegan and thought this place would be a great place to grab a healthy 'juice'. So I come here with my dad and he orders a parfait and I order a green 'juice' and the total comes to about $16 dollars with tip. I thought that was a tad on the expensive side but I know the prices of juice are very expensive because of the amount of vegetables and fruits that go into a juice (I worked at a juice bar for about two years so I understand juice pricing). So my 'juice' comes out and it's a smoothie? I do not know how they can call these smoothies juices?! It was frozen and it was really sweet for something that was considered a green juice. I was very disappointed and felt very mislead. My dad did not like his parfait either (too sugary). As a health nut and a biochemist I would not consider this place to be healthy at all. Albeit I have not tried any other items but i will assure you that I will not be coming back to try anything else. The only time that any one should go sugar load there is after a very High intensity work out. The only reason I have this place two stars is because the service was lovely.   A note for the greens and proteins owners:  I would recommend rewording the menu so it is not so misleading. I know you mean well and have a great idea but for people educated on health and wellness it is very misleading.",

Lol   I also really like the atmosphere since I am usually finishing a run or workout when I visit I don't always look my best. The staff is always friendly. And there's always others in workout clothes too. I don't feel out of place here. Also an okay place to visit solo",

    "text": "I had brunch at this location for the first time last week, using a Groupon before it expired.  I was supposed to meet Suzy H. and her son here, but due to a miscommunication, she went to the Eastern location instead.  No problem.  Intending to share my food, it just meant that I ate two breakfast items all by myself, the Granola Crusted Whole Wheat French toast and the Greek Scramble.  Sure, I could have taken leftovers to go, but I just kept eating until there was nothing left but the parsley.  I guess I was hungry from my earlier swim, but it was also because the food was really good.  I'd been to the Eastern location about two years ago and had a so-so experience for dinner, so much so that I've never been back there.  This brunch, though, has changed my mind about G&P.  I would certainly come back anytime for a morning meal.  I had excellent service throughout, and, contrary to my own belief, the cost for breakfast wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be, $13.94 for both dishes.  Of course, having my Groupon handy made it even cheaper, but still.  I look forward to returning by myself, or with Suzy H., or with anyone else who wants to have a healthier breakfast at a decent price.     P.S.:  Suzy H. and I ended up eating breakfast together after all, via cellphone.  That's what friends are for :)",

I have laryngitis otherwise I would have requested a do over in the store. The lady that took my order for a green ginger limeade was wearing plastic gloves that she handled my money with. I then witnessed her sweeping the floor with the same gloves on & then delivering a meal with the same gloves. That customer sent his meal back for more rice. She made my drink with the same gloves on & I think she was having a rough night as my drink was devoid of any ginger or lime & was watered down. Just as I got my drink another customer came back in to complain & have their green ginger limeade remade as it was waterey. Please have your employees change their gloves as the above is very unhygienic. I should have also asked for a redo on my drink.",

I also love how they have quite a few local business cards and promo materials at the pickup counter where you get your drinks- shows that they are involved in the local community, which I really like to see.  That being said, their smoothies and wraps are each around $8, which sounds about on par with other similar businesses- and for the smoothies I would say it's about right. But I was not impressed with my tofu/chorizo breakfast wrap- I asked for it in a spinach wrap, which I use frequently at home to make my own wraps, and this one was not particularly full. Most bites had more overlapping layers of tortilla than filling or veggies. On top of that, the menu lists the wrap as coming with \"a side of tofu homefries\"- this sounded really cool to me and I was excited to check it out. Imagine my surprise when I open my take out box in my car and realize that a \"side\" consists of exactly THREE crouton-sized pieces of tofu. They were tasty, but considering I spent $8 on my meal and my take out box was half empty, I'm not pleased. I genuinely don't know if someone was in a hurry and forgot my side, or if three pieces really constitutes a portion- it doesn't to me.  I might come back, but it won't be for food- which is really disappointing, because everything sounds great.  Side note: If you check in on Yelp, you get a dollar off of a juice or smoothie, which helps a bit with the pricing.",

I come here for the smoothies, not the food. I have always found the food here to be really bland and overpriced. The gluten-free bread is terrible. Don't bother freaking out over it. Their tofu fries are AMAZING. I love love love these. They are pretty much the only thing I will order as far as solid food goes. Buffalo sauce is very tasty as well and they have a nice vegan alternative that comes with these if you ask.  I really do love the smoothies. I've been coming here for a few years now, and their smoothies never get old. They are super refreshing, healthy, and I really do think it's a reasonable price compared to Whole Foods (not to mention they taste way better).   This location does have a nice outside seating area (complete with umbrellas), which I do enjoy in the summer.",

It took forever for the cashier to acknowledge me because she and another staff member were texting and talking on their cell phones.  Very unprofessional, poor customer service, unfriendly.

So my friend talked me into ordering the Bison Cheese Steak which honestly was good but for sure not worth $10.99 I got a pinch on cheese steak with ALL that bread and some light mozzarella..

The tofu fries are very tasty and amazingly seasoned, however the menu states they are BAKED when they are actually FRIED, they automatically lose two stars for the False advertisement (which I've complained to management several times and STILL haven't changed on their menu).  There are about 5 or 6 different fresh juices on their menu and they do taste good, but they could use a little more variety.  Nearly all of their juices contain grapes and agave nectar.  Their Wellness Drink, which contains spinach and kale, also adds too much pineapple, orange and agave, making this fresh juice overly sweet.  They are located across the LVAC so there are a lot of people coming from the gym seeking a healthy meal.  But don't be fooled!! A lot of their menu IS healthy however things like sauces, cheeses, dough, batter etc. almost defeat the purpose here.  If you're truly seeking wholesome order the plainest rawest things on their menu.  I go to greens & proteins for the convenience and taste, but think there are better similar establishments.  Also a little pricey but have a large menu to choose from.",

I was told I had to make sure I spent at least $12 for the Groupon deal so I went ahead and ordered an Acai Smoothie which wasn't amazing compared to other Acai smoothies I've ordered but still drink worthy. For a meal I ordered the Turkey Burger with Jicama Fries as I've never had Jicama before and well, the turkey burger was excellent but Jicama, I am NOT a fan of you and should have gone with the Tofu instead. There was a little bit of a wait especially in between my smoothie and meal, like I literally was almost done with my smoothie by the time my food was ready but all staff members had a smile on their face, very friendly and even with some slow service I still got in and out of there in a decent amount of time during the lunch hour. I'll definitely be back to try more especially as they serve healthy menu items for a fair price compared to others!",

Then that is not considered a juice! That is a blended vegetable drink. If I wasn't with my coworkers I would have asked for a full refund because I was not even able to drink it. I am on a strict juice diet and cannot have much fiber and that was definitely not in the description. Plus you would think being a healthy alternative restaurant they would know that blending vegetables ruins the nutrient value.   You would think when somebody advertises juices that it would be juice not blended and chunky ( gross)   Waste of my time and money! Ended up skipping lunch that day because I couldn't finish the \"juice\" without gagging and didn't have time to go anywhere else.   I am giving it a two star because inside was clean, nice, and customer service was great! Everybody who got food there said it was a bit overpriced, which I agree.

Unfortunately our most recent experiences have not met our expectations. Last week my food was so terrible that I saved it until I got off work and gave it to my dog. Today my Lady and I ordered a couple of wraps and once again they were terrible. The food is not what drove me to give this place 1 star, it was after speaking to the manager that I decided this place will no longer get our business. I explained to the manager that my Cajun Angus Wrap was nothing more than ground beef with a few pieces of cabbage, not slaw. She then goes on to tell me that that's how the wraps are made and then proceeded to tell me the ingredients. Wait.. I tell you the quality that I'm use to receiving from your establishment, then I tell you the quality has not been met and you tell me that's how it should be? At that point I just cut her off and once again let her know that I have ordered this more than 20 times and I know what to expect. At this point she proceeded to tell me how she was going to rectify the issue but by then I had tuned her out and was in a rush to get off of the phone. I figured with the hundreds of dollars we've spent at this established we definitely deserved better. So our search begins for the next healthy spot with good food.",

If you order their drinks, grab the epoxy app so you can get their virtual stamp card. Cashier told me their Wellness Drink was the most popular. It's pretty good - if you like grapes.   My favorite has got to be their tofu fries! I always try to get an extra order to go :0).   I've been here a few times and there are times where the food is bleh (depending on what you order) and other times they're decent. Aside from the tofu fries, nothing else has stood out to me so just give yourself a few visits to try various stuff.  The turkey club sandwich also wasn't too shabby. But it's definitely better than eating at Sweet Tomatoes every time I want something healthy.",

This is my second time at g&p but my first at this location. Its super hip and it's also a great place for your lunch break or catch up on work.   I ordered their bison cheese steak on a spinach wrap which is about 600+ calories for $10.99. It also comes with their yummy tofu fries and dipping sauce! The cheese steak is delish and the bison is super lean. Bison is just naturally full in flavor so if you're looking for a good manly meat that's lean but tastes like cow (mmoooo) go bison! I also ordered their white chocolate veggiechino which is 500+ calories for $6.99. I chose the almond milk (you can choose the option of soy or Almond milk) it was pretty delish with grains of grinded up coffee bean. If you're looking for a big caffeine kick I would not bet that the veggiechino will be a good pick me up especially if you're a coffee drinker. But as a sweet milky treat. I think it's a good choice.   My meal summed up to $20 for myself. It is a bit pricey but if it's just one of those clean eating going out to lunch days I say go for it but I would only drop in occasionally if I'm in the mood. I just think their price does equal the value in portion for me.",

I'm ok with paying for good quality if the ingredients are healthy, just can't come here too often. I appreciate them showing the calorie count!!",

    "text": "While this place is fine and technically proficient, I was not wowed or amazed by my meal, and for the price, I would not come back here again.  I did the make your own meal where you pick a protein, a \"green\", a \"grain\" and a sauce.  The chicken was done well and was juicy, the quinoa was a bit on the al dente side for me, but again was fine, and avocado is avocado.  What I did not care for was how they served it.  It was on a large plate, with everything separate and not touching.  I felt like someone who had OCD fixed the plate.  I would've preferred a bowl where I could mix the things together with the sauce, since quinoa isn't exactly easy to get on a fork with chicken and avocado already on it.  Quinoa is also rather bland by itself.  I also got the Thai Ginger soup, which was more like a thick yellow curry with nothing in it.  I love ginger, and couldn't really taste it in this soup, which was disappointing to me, as it's the reason I ordered it.  I would honestly give this place 2.5 stars, more on the lines of \"meh\" than A-ok, and that's mainly because the service here was decent and the people working behind the counter were nice and helpful.  I would honestly rather go to the Sweet Tomatoes down the street as it's about the same cost depending on what you order.",

It's in a cool area with lots of fitness/health type shops, and it was positively buzzing with the weekday lunch crowd; obviously a fave for the health conscious professionals.  The HCG menu is simple; choose a protein & a veggie, they do the rest.  No measuring or worrying about how to prepare while sticking to the diet plan, they have it all figured out for me.  I ordered mine to go, shrimp & asparagus; it took about 15 minutes, and a guy brought it to my table. I had to take a peek once I made it to the car; wow!  Jumbo shrimp & skinny asparagus, both tender & perfectly cooked, served in a reusable plastic container with a side of dijon mustard.  Delicious!  What a treat to get to have a meal out & know it's structured around my diet; LOVED IT!!",

I'll be back, let's break it down  Atmosphere: Clean, well lighted,,, I felt healthy walking in. Smells fresh.  Basic seating set up.  I went at 11:30 Saturday and it was not too crowded,, people there but not too much.  Food: That's what you're here for right? The best description again is,,, clean.  Seems to me that it's all natural organic type food.  I've had burgers, Avocado/Crab cups, and some of the drinks.  Burgers are surprisingly juicy, and I'm looking to try some of the salads next time.  Drink: Note the smoothies are like a meal so you probably don't want that AND a full meal unless you are splitting.   The juices are all very nice and clean.  Favourite is the Wellness drink.  Price: For what it is,,  a little expensive,, a juice and any meal will be twenty.  One of the other Yelpers claimed it was the Whole Foods of restaurants and I think its a great comparison.  Miscellaneous: One of the few places I can think of that put calorie counts.",

    "text": "I saw this on my way into Zabbas last week and mentally bookmarked this place.  I am always down to try a new place that is supposedly healthy.   Wow, was I surprised.  In the first 48 hours I had eaten here for lunch, dinner and lunch again!  Walking into the place was a little daunting.  This place was so busy that there was literally a line out the door.  All the tables were filled and we were worried we'd have nowhere to sit.  This place is very hectic loud like a high school cafeteria!   The floors are nicely tiled, the tables are high end wood, as are the chairs.  There are booths along a window that, if one can grab, are pretty comfortable to sit at.  The menu consists of Breakfast items (until 11am), Soups, Salads, Pizzas, BURGERS and Wraps/Sandwiches.  Calorie Counts are next to their popular items!  To drink, there is your standard coke fountain with a dedicated dispenser for WATER.  :)  The place is very busy, but still manages to be clean.  There are no trashcans in sight, you just leave your table and the staff quickly cleans up after you.  The first time out I ordered the Ostrich Burger with Swiss Cheese and Tofu Fries.  Despite the cost of being over $15 for my order, it was delicious and I felt it was well worth it.  The burger was a tiny bit dry, but delicious nonetheless.  Burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato and onion.  The tofu fries were unique.  I wasn't impressed at first but I later realized it was because the fries weren't cooked all the way and it was still squishy in the middle.  This meal I would rate a 8 out of 10.  Later that night I came back again and the place seemed to be less busy.  This time I ordered the Turkey Wrap with bacon and a spinach tortilla and Jicama fries (it's like eating a raw apple sliced up like fries).  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I loved it - I was very impressed.  On to my next meal here at lunch:  This time I ordered the Bison Burger Swiss cheese, medium rare with Jicama Fries.  The burger was just the right amount of juicy absolutely incredible.   Where else can you eat a burger like this guilt free?  I also ordered a Green Leaf Berry Blast shake with almond milk.  It was very good and satisfied my cravings for fresh fruit.  Be warned, however.  Buying a shake with one of their meals is like eating two meals in one.  I was completely stuffed by the end of my visit.  Today for lunch I ordered the Turkey Burger with Swiss and half Jicama fries, half tofu fries.  To drink I got the Apple Pie Smoothie with Almond milk.  I was impressed with the burger.  Very juicy and tasty.  The Jicama fries are spot on.  Just like eating an apple again and served raw with paprika.  The Tofu fries this time however was even better than I remembered.  This is because they were actually cooked all the way through.  If I can get tofu fries prepared like this again, I think Jicama is in trouble!  On the other hand, the Apple Pie Smoothie left more to be desired. I am not a fan of this.  I am sure to visit again to try the Bison Wrap with Spinach tortilla.  My friends have all been getting it, but before I settle into my \"norm\" i wanted to try as much as possible here.  If my norm is the bison wrap, so be it. :)   This place has definitely earned a solid top entry for my work lunch rotation.  I am only giving four stars for a simple reason: the guy that took my order at the register the past two times doesn't seem very friendly at all. Not a smile; not even a forced smile - it's like I'm bothering him when ordered.  On top of that, I don't EVER get a receipt from him or even offered a water cup.  The other guy, who appears to be either a manager or owner is very friendly and helpful.  Other suggestions to the owners if you are reading: You need more tables and seating - It appears the suite next to you is empty, consider expanding. :)",

BOTH locations are super clean, great seatin in&outside 2.  Breakfast options at all good, healthy but not boring 3. Lunch options are just as awesome, the quality of their products shines through in all their dishes. Very unique!  4.  Lastly is the star of the show... The JUICES!! OMG! Seriously, I'm not even a juice guy, but they make them so different and enjoyable, you don't even know it's healthy.  The wellness that everyone raves about is all that.... 7 or 8 diff green fruits & leafy's with a touch of agave and your Good to go!  Way to go G&P!  You hit the nail on the head.  Keep it up!",

I ordered an order of the chicken satay and had managed to snag a few bites of my man's teriyaki chicken wrap. I wanted to try their smoothies or juices, but I convinced myself to settle with their complimentary cucumber water to drink. Frankly, I couldn't justify paying more for juice than I paid for my entree. (Huge cheapo moment).   I enjoyed my satay as it was a good amount of skewers and actually tasted like I had ordered them from a Thai restaurant. The wrap was okay... lacked a little flavor as I couldn't taste any sauce, but it wasn't bad. I liked the tofu fries I ordered along with it.   One of the best parts was seeing all the pre/post workout LVAC members who entered and exited as we ate. This not only gave me more motivation to get my booty in the gym, but also showed that this business was thriving and providing great, healthy options for those in town. I love seeing a place with active \"regulars.\"   On my next visit, I hope not to be too cheap to not try the juices and smoothies. :)",

I visited their Green Valley location and found the food to be a healthy alternative, but a little on the pricey side compared to other restaurants that offer similar fare (Rachel's Kitchen, Daily Wellness, etc).  About a week later I decided to give the Greens and Proteins location at Flamingo and the 215 a try and I was greatly disappointed.  The service was very slow and when I brought the issue to the manager's attention his reaction was trite and condescending.  He did nothing to rectify the situation and told me I had no reason to complain.  When I went to eat my to-go order, an ostrich burger lettuce wrap, I found it was topped with a rotten avocado and it was missing the turkey bacon I ordered.    For the price point (my meal was $18) I found the service and quality to be lacking.  On the upside, after reading another negative Yelp! review of this establishment, I found a great nearby \"healthy alternative\" restaurant that I will be returning to for sure.",

The serving here is smaller than usual and is pricey.   My bf and I ordered a bison burger (very dry even though my bf mentioned that he wanted it cooked medium), crab wrap and a BBQ chicken pizza. For 3 items, it was almost $40. The crab wrap was not bad. You can see some crab pieces in it. The pizza was okay. Nothing special.   One thing I liked here is their free cucumber lemon water. Very refreshing!   Not sure if we will be back.",

I ordered a new item, the Ahi Protein Salad, and the chef stopped by my table to get feedback on it. Because it was new. LOVE THAT. My previous favorite was the Summer Berry Salad. Now I have a sweet option and a savory option. I feel like the restaurant is run professionally, they clean up tables the moment people get up, the food is yummy and healthy. What more could you want?",

    "text": "Vegan, gf & raw! So excited!  THOSE WITH CELIAC'S/GLUTEN INTOLERANCE BE CAREFUL: see below  I was very excited to discover this chain had opened up on the southwest part of town. They are ingeniously located near LVAC, making it easy to get a healthy recovery meal after your workout. We ordered: Pumpkin spice chai latte, veggie garden burger, and bison burger. Total after tip= $38.10 (we took our food to go). A little on the high end $$$. Our food came out pretty quickly, but our smoothie took longer than expected. I was hoping to get that first and sip on that as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I don't know if they forgot about our smoothie or was just slow on making it. I did notice however, people after me get their drink before me, they also knew him on a first name basis and gave him the extra out of the blender in a separate cup. They should treat everyone as if they are a regular. Talk about not making me feel special.   ~Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte; Chai Tea, Pumpkin, Green Cabbage, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Flax Seeds, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts, Agave Nectar. This was really good and very filling. Although the cabbage was pronounced, the smoothie was well balanced and tasted raw (the way I like it).  ~Bison burger w/ jicama fries; choice of swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce tomato and onion on a whole grain bun. He wished he got it with cheddar rather than swiss. \"Jicama fries\" are just sliced jicama lightly seasoned with what looks/tastes paprika.   *Veggie garden burger; I was extremely excited because I'm a sucker for alfalfa sprouts. I asked the cashier if the veggie patty was gluten free, as I have had a difficult time finding a veggie patty that does not use \"wheat gluten\" as a binder. He asked someone on the cooking line, who I assume was a manager, and he said \"yes, it's gf, the patty is soy based protein\" I took their word for it and gambled the risk. Sure enough I think the veggie patty is glutenous so BEWARE to those with celiac's/gluten intolerance. I got sick, as I do from eating or cross-contaminating with gluten/wheat. I have yet to bring my concern to the attention of the staff. Moving forward, the burger was eh-okay. My gluten free bun was hard (it's difficult to get a soft, buoyant bun using gluten free flour, especially if you're taking your item to go. In the future I will dine in. I ordered my burger with tofu fries. I was told that they dust the tofu blocks with rice flour and fry it in corn oil, so the oil should not be a point of cross contamination, as there isn't anything else with regular flour going into the oil. My burger came with the sprouts, bibb lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I also added vegan cheese, it's shredded.  We also added avocado to our sandwiches ($0.75/burger) for a quarter of an avocado (rip off). I don't mind paying extra for modifications, but make it worth my while and not be so skimpy! At least give me a half an avocado for that price, so that I can have it in every bite as opposed to just half my burger. I was charged extra for vegan cheese, again this would be fine, but there was less than a teaspoon sprinkled on my burger, with a $1.00 up-charge.  Although the food is pricey, it's raw, healthy, and typically quick, right up my alley. I will be back because there is not many others around like this and to inform them of my gf veggie patty concerns. There are just a few \"tweeks\" they need to adjust before they get the 5th star from me.I hope they properly label their menu on their website and physical menu so gluten free & vegan items are clearly marked. Just remember they do not operate out of a certified gluten free kitchen, but it seems that for the most part they handle issues like cross contamination okay.  Service was exceptional. There was a constant line (with one cashier) at 3:00pm. He was very nice and patient with me since I had a lot of questions.",

The place was almost empty and after ordering my Greek Scramble and coffee, I took a seat at a table under the section near the entrance that has a roof overhead.  The young lady who took my order, gave me a post with a number so she'd know where the food was to be delivered.  She soon brought my coffee which was very hot and enjoyable.  The Greek scramble consisted of scrambled egg whites with feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil, green peppers, onions, and was accompanied by tofu home fries.  Their information lists this at 309 calories.  I wasn't concerned so much about that as I was taste.  The taste was quite good.  The olives brought out the flavor of the feta and the tofu home fries were a treat.  There were some pieces of toasted pita to accompany the scramble.  I will stop in again and try something else.  The price was very reasonable and the patio dining was perfect before the hot days set in.  One note for those who ride a bicycle--few I know--there is a garbage can on the east side of the building and you can lock your bike to that with your cable.",

The first time I ordered a grilled chicken teriyaki wrap and the chicken was practically burnt and there was no teriyaki sauce. I had to ask for extra to put it on myself. This time I ordered the summer berry salad with chicken and it was drowning in dressing and had like 5 berries with undercooked chewy chicken. My fountain drink was good though. This place is overrated BIG TIME.!!",

I then asked about the Salads and then portion size. I made sizes with my hands. Again a blank stare. It was pulling teeth to get anything out of her.

He was nice and was able to make my order vegan. He was also kind enough to sub out a non vegan sauce for one I would like.   I ordered a veggie burger without the bun since the bun wasn't vegan and a gluten free vegan bun was $3 more. After consuming the burger, the bun wouldn't have made a difference. It was bland and...well bland. The tofu fries on the other hand were amazing! Add the BBQ sauce and wow!   Service was a lot better from my first visit last year. I was asked if I needed anything else after my food was delivered and I asked if silverware was in a specific area. The gentleman then offered to grab them for me instead. The staff seemed more cheerful than what I experienced last year. However I can see why they would be Debbie downers. They have people coming in asking for sparkling water in a different language. Just say sparkling water!   Overall, this visit was better than the first. And to the lady who was asked to leave because your dog wasn't a service dog, there's still no sign saying service dogs only.  Remember, it's a food establishment...with an open juice bar. I'm sure most people would like their juices without animal hair.",

The shopping center that its located in is practically dead. the only thing opened next to G & P is a tanning salon and a zabas, everything is closed or empty.   Upon entering you can see the inside is actually really nice. I think it actually looks better than the one on eastern. The menu is pretty clear and precise. It ranges from green juices, green smoothies and then your food items. All the food items i would say are healthy, you can even get gluten free items or protein style for your burgers if you want.  I ordered from the create your own menu. Basically you pick a protein, 1 side and a grain and your choice of sauce. I picked bison patty for my protein and sauteed spinach, and grilled onions for my sides instead of getting a grain. I also ordered a wellness drink.  The bison patty was cooked as ordered it didn't strike me as anything amazing. It was kind of bland and dry. I'm assuming it was bland because it was healthier. The spinach and the onions tasted exactly as they should nothing special but was expected. The wellness drink was actually my favorite of all the items ordered it tasted really good for all the green vegetables in it. It was actually really sweet so i think they probably put more juice in it to mask the vegetable taste.  Overall place isn't bad but nothing special. One thing I must warn you about is, it is extremely overpriced! Looking at the prices i was surprised they charged so much for vegetables you can buy and make a whole weeks worth for the price the same price.   Side note: there are also a lot of jacked up guys and girls in yoga pants that stop in because the LVAC is right next to it. So if you want to sit in and people watch it is a good place to do that.",

It's possible I ordered entirely the wrong thing, but it also took forever to come out (20 minutes), and then one of the containers exploded (opened) in the car and spilled salad all over the floor.   The bison burger, which I ordered medium, was way way way overdone. Well done in fact. It was flavorless, and the toppings were soggy even though they were separate from the burger. It came with jicama or tofu fries. I got the jicama fries. They were covered in chili powder. I'm not a fan of chili powder. I love jicama. I also got a caesar salad, which was itself actually good minus the exploding container. The little tub of dressing would not have been enough had I not lost half of the salad to the car floorboards, so that was a blessing in disguise. Burger and salad cost $11+5, fountain drink was $2 or $3. They also offer fancy healthy shakes/smoothies for $6-7.   Menu not offered in a format other than 10 feet above the registers or glued to the counter at the register. Made it hard to figure out what to order since I couldn't read the options. :/",

The atmosphere is bright and inviting. It just looks healthy. Almost like a Jamba Juice, but in restaurant form. The menus are clear and displayed nicely above the registers on a few flat screens.  I ordered the bison cheese steak on a wheat wrap. It comes with a side of tofu fries or jicama fries. I went with the tofu. The wrap wasn't bad. It tasted like a ground beef wrap. The tofu fries were surprisingly good. However, I'm a tofu fan, so take that with a grain of salt. My coworker on the other hand hates the tofu fries.  I wish there was an option to order something unhealthy here. Just because I want a healthy entree doesn't necessarily mean I want a healthy side too. I should be able to get artery clogging potato french fries with my healthy ostrich burger. I shouldn't be limited to an all or nothing healthy meal.  My coworkers love this place, so inevitably I'll be here again. I would never come here on my own though. I don't like paying a premium for anything, even if it is organic and healthy.

They offer a good variety of meals for people who are watching their diet. They offer salads, burgers, sandwiches, bowls, smoothies, and juices.    I came here for dinner with my girlfriend today and was pleased at how clean it still is after being around for couple years. The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had regarding the menu. I ordered the bison burger and my girlfriend ordered the bison cheesesteak. Definitely not the healthiest things, but we were hungry... GAINZ. One thing I love about them is that they always have the cucumber water and it tastes so refreshing! We sat outside because the weather was nice and our meals did not take too long to make as well. The server brought it out to us and made sure we had everything that we needed. The bison burger was amazing! I got it medium rare and glad I did because you can feel the juices with every bite! They cooked it perfectly and it definitely tasted a lot cleaner than your usual burger. My girlfriend enjoyed her cheesesteak and took half of it home because the other half got her full. We got tofu fries as our side and I suggest anyone to get it! It's so good! The price range for the two items is around $10-$12 each I believe. Couldn't remember the exact price. Overall I prefer this over protein source as they have better tasting food! Price is about the same.",

I was greeted by a bunch of smiling, happy associates. Props to the manager because everyone had a great attitude. The young guy Alex at the register had great recommendations and I told him to \"take the wheel\" and order something he thought I would enjoy.. and boy did I! He set me up with a Bison Wrap and some sweet potato fries. It was delish, mad props to Alex for the hook-up. Ambiance is nice; lots of people on work breaks or fresh out of the gym, chatting happily over their meals.  I will definitely be back soon!",

Honestly this place rocks. Breakfast served all day and the caloric value of each item is stated on the menu.

I stopped by on my lunch because I wanted a smoothie to sip on throughout the afternoon at work.  When I walked in, I immediately liked the environment.  Everything was open and clean.  There was only one person in front of me, who was finishing paying.  She and the man behind the register were having a friendly conversation... that continued for quite some time and in to the time where she was waiting for her food.  I was only slightly annoyed since I was on a time constraint.  I ended up ordering the Green Leaf Berry Blast with soy because it sounded both delicious and tasty.  Upon receiving it, I was surprised at its brownish color (which later understandably turned green due to the veggies in it).   My first sip was a shocker... I was not a fan.  I drink soy milk all the time in replacement of regular milk.  There was just a taste that reminded me of liquid Maalox.  I honestly think that my choice on the menu was just a poor one and I would have been better off with a juice.  Next time, I will definitely opt for one of those.  I feel bad that I wasted over $8, but I've definitely learned my lesson!",

The burrito had the right amount of heat but not too overwhelming. I also ordered a strawberry watermelon shake, it was so refreshing. They also offer complimentary cucumber lemon water, we couldn't get enough!  They offer a breakfast and lunch menu. They also have different types of proteins, such as bison and ostrich meat. Another reason to come here is their juices and shakes!   A must try!",

My soup came out thick as I like it, but the tofu fries were way thinner than the Eastern location and one of them was half the length. See the pic I posted.   There was also a customer who seemed to be a regular harassing all the women who walked in. Then, the customer walked into the kitchen and just started talking to the kitchen staff. He had no hairnet on so it's possible his hair was falling off into the food, then he just grabbed his own food from the kitchen.",

The seasoning was good on them but I definitely wouldn't recommend them for takeout unless you are eating them immediately. (Duh)   Got the bison burger because I read multiple reviews. I got mine with cheddar, turkey bacon, and avocado. So SO good!!! The flavor of this burger was amazing. Over a week after eating it and I'm drooling on the keyboard over this review. I didn't think I would get a burger of all things here but I am so happy I did!   I love juices so I tried the green ginger juice (don't remember the exact name) it was probably the best juice I've ever purchased. I love ginger and this juice was just too good.

    "text": "I have to agree with some of the other posters about the bland food.  Decided to check this place out for the first time with a friend and unfortunately, can't see myself returning.  I ordered a rough cut roma tomato salad and the tortilla soup.  My friend ordered what looked like a mix of steamed veggies and rice (steamed broccoli, kale, mixed squash/zucchini).   The salad they brought out for me was mainly radicchio and frisee (the red/purple lettuce and the light green \"fuzzy\" lettuce just in case you're not sure what that is); two of the most bitter greens that I'm least fond of.  The dressing was a bitter vinaigrette with lemon, I believe.  The tomato slices appeared to have been sitting out for a while; not fresh at all.  There were some spinach leaves thrown in along with some cucumber.  I took a bite and was hit with bland bitterness.  At first, I thought there just wasn't dressing but the guy explained that there was dressing on it.  The tortilla soup came out and did not look like soup - it appeared very thick, almost like orange hummus.  I dipped in and it tasted very sweet, like pumpkin, without any type of \"mexican/tortilla\" flavor.  I couldn't force myself to eat it although I was starving.  I told my friend she should try the soup to see if it was just me.  She seemed very hesitant by the look of it.  She took a dip and stated, \"There is no flavor....it's just...sweet?\"  I didn't quite understand what I had ordered.  Her meal came out; just steamed veggies and brown rice.  I tried some and it was fine but I can't fathom paying the $13 for this when it is one of the easiest things to make at home....steamed veggies and rice.  I lost out on $12 myself.  I couldn't eat my food and soon pushed it to the side so I could just focus on hang time and not the hunger pangs in my stomach.  When I left, I came home and made an amazing organic salad, topped with LOTS of avocado.  They should hire me to improve their salad menu. :)",

I'm really big in to health and fitness, and this place definitely meets the needs of health freaks, while also giving some more indulgent options as well. No matter what I always order the Wellness Drink every time I go. SO AMAZING and packed with fresh delicious ingredients. If you're a green juice person, this is the drink for you! I also usually always order their barbecue chicken pizza. The crust is amazing, the thin crust and the gluten free, I've had both, and the sauce and flavor is just incredible and the pizza only has 320 cals! How awesome. I have also had one of their wraps, forget the name but it's packed with a ton of vegetables and comes with tofu fries. So delicious, except I would say that the asparagus in the wrap was just a little too crunchy for me and kind of threw off the texture of the rest of it. I also have been to the Henderson location many times, and I must say this location just does it was better! The shape of their pizza is better and the taste of their smoothie was amazing.. but overall.. LOVEEE greens and proteins! definitely go if you have the chance! you won't regret it!!",

I don't remember them doing this before. The drink was watery with chunks of ice left in. The person taking our orders totally blew it with one ... leaving out the peanuts and honey. I'll go back, but be more careful about ordering.  Review 11/4/17: We've tried a few more times since my last review (which somehow never got posted). They've changed menus several times (with price increases accordingly). Today we ordered 2 more smoothies specifying \"no ice\" and \"no honey\". They were both so sicky-sweet we had to trash them after a few sips. Apparently (and confirmed by the server), the sugar comes from the \"chocolate chips). Really? They used to include Stevia, honey, and the banana as the sugar sources. My conclusion is they switched to a cheaper sweetened chocolate. Sigh! Another establishment starts up with ideals and slips into mediocrity as economic reality sets in (I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that profit margins are not the drivers here).",

They do really try to have the answers to their food. I kind of stumped them today but it doesn't take away at all from how I feel about this establishment. The only thing they didn't know was whether or not there soy products are organic. I think as a health restaurant that should be something that should be known. But other than that people were great. The food came out hot for the hot food and cold for the cold food. It was cooked to the right temperature. The food does taste fresh. The food is always good. The restaurant is clean. Even the bathroom is clean. I kind of use the bathroom as a way to make sure the entire place is clean. If they keep their bathroom clean they for damn sure will keep their restaurant clean. The only reason I don't give them a five star is because they aren't the best food I have ever had. But damn it they are good! I would recommend this place to everyone. Specifically the one on Grand Canyon and Flamingo. That's the only one I've been to. Keep up the good work Greens and Proteins! You always satisfy me!",

I've gotten the oatmeal with bananas, cinnamon, raisins. The mulitgrain protein pancakes and granola french toast have to be my favorites. I loved the turkey sausage and egg whites. The portions are pretty big, which I like because I can share with someone or take the rest home. I love the Berry Blast smoothie which is nice when I'm on the go and can't sit down to eat. I can stop in and just grab a smoothie. I have been here quite a few times and I notice that sometimes the food can take about 15-20 minutes to come out, even when I only have one entree for myself. Other than that, the staff is very nice, the place is clean, and the food is tasty!",

I was skeptical because healthy food tends to be poor in taste but this is not the case at G&P. The chocolate and peanut butter shake was excellent and I had no clue there were vegetables mixed in. Then the meal came out and wow the whole wheat French toast was scrumptious ! This place has completely changed my mind about health food tasting like cardboard that's for sure. The owner himself even came out to greet me and ask how my meal was. I give five stars for the original recipe, the cleanliness of the establishment and the fact that the owner has direct involvement in the operation. This is always indicates that someone takes pride in what they do and wants the best quality products/services for their customers. I'll be back soon.",

This place is an anomoly in Vegas, where the level of obesity rivals any in America.  It is full of Vegan hipsters,granola munching anti-gluteners, and fitness junkies.  I felt like I had been transported to Santa Cruz or Berkeley!  I ordered a chicken parmagian from their daily specials - it was created with a leaning towards Paleo: spaghetti squash topped with chicken breast and covered in a marinara and (this parts not Paleo) cheeses.   It came with a side dish of cooked fresh spinach, which I topped with a basalmic reduction.  The spaghetti squash was well drained and cooked perfectly - when I make it at home, it's squishy and unevenly cooked!  The marinara had a nice fresh flavor and the cheeses were melted in goey goodness.  The spinach was plain so I requested a vinegar to top it with - the friendly and creative 'waiter' suggested the basalmic.  The service was friendly and helpful - I'm definitely coming back when I am in Las Vegas.",

Now the bison wrap, not bad, not great nothing special. The bison was again no flavor but noted this is a health food spot so understandable some sauce they provided made the wrap taste better and i ate it just fine. Now my main problem the \"TOFU FRIES\"; if you like this you might as well eat cardboard probably taste better and better for you, this was horrible the texture and flavor was like processed plastic?! ive had similar tofu fries before and they were way better than this, def recommend trying the napkins. Overall i get where this place is going and not being a health nut i cant really complain i just wont eat here and let my gf enjoy it.",

I got the Buffalo Spinach Wrap and was pretty disappointed. It was pretty bland and mushy and all I could really taste was the wrap itself, which is pretty damn disappointing when you were paying for Bison meat. The Jicama fries were nice, but cold; didn't realize they'd be raw. Silly me. I actually didn't finish my meal, and at $14, that was a pricey \"ugh,\".   One of my other co-workers had a smoothie that looked absolutely wonderful, and another had a little pizza thing that looked lovely. Not a place I would normally choose to go for lunch, and I think my inexperience may have done me wrong here.   I am pretty generally of the opinion that Vegans, Raw Foodists, and their Health Food Prophets care more about how well their food follows certain rules than how it tastes.   Greens and Proteins kind of tastes like compromise. Mmmmm...compromise.  Yeah. No. I'll probably be back in the future; the Smoothies look great, and I hope I just ate the wrongest thing. I'll give this place another try in the hopes that something else I order is enjoyable. Otherwise, I just felt like I was paying triple price for grocery store deli food in order to say \"I'm healthy! I eat raw vegan carrots!.\"",

It would be a favorite among anyone that tries it, and a favorite among customers. You can make your own meal, so you can try many different combinations of food and try things here that you wouldn't have otherwise. The only downside to m is the pricetag, it can be a little pricy, but this hits a specific niche of people that will spend the money to eat at a place like this.

I ordered my normal breakfast to be picked up on my way into the office this morning. Well...that pickup turned into a cancel because I drove right by the exit, yup I didn't even think about exiting (I guess my autopilot kicked in ha!)   I went ahead and called over to give them the courtesy call that I would not be able to make it and they can do what they please with the food. Becca (I believe her name was) answered the phone and had her supervisor jump on the line.   Priscilla assured me that it was alright and that they would re-make it when I could come by later in the day, all I needed was to give them a 10-15 minute window. Sure enough, when I called Priscilla answered and she knew right away and said it was no problem and that they would have it ready. I was elated!  I know this a bit lengthy, but I would like to express my gratitude to G&P staff! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Superb customer service and always delicious food!",

They were kind and kept apologizing but it really was our fault for not reading all of the ingredients closely to see one was an allergen.   The prices are pretty high but this is a health menu restaurant. The indoor sitting area seemed uncomfortable and multiple two seated tables. The outdoors seating was beautiful and welcoming. It was a beautiful day so that just added to the attraction.  The plates arrived with a large serving of food and the dishes were tasty. It was not a place for a wow factor but great service. I enjoyed the Chicken Quinoa salad and my friend had the Fresh Fruit salad.",

Me and a friend both ordered the bison burger in a lettuce wrap with tofu fries and I also ordered a Green Ginger limeaid.  The green drink showed up quick and was sooooo good!  A+ and about 10ish minutes later our food arrived....The burgers had the bun on them instead of the lettuce wrap but the waiter was really great and brought the lettuce out promptly!  The burger was delicious!  There was some sort of yummy sauce that came with it too.  The tofu fries were ok...they weren't hot :(  probably would have been great if they were hot, but I ate them anyways bc they were still good.  Next time I will order the jicama fries.  Cant wait to come back to G & P and try everything else out!",

Now I'm used to cooking and making my own healthy greens and protein foods, so I have a bit higher standard for places like this. First of all, they are relatively expensive but this is understandable considering the healthy ingredients which tend to be natural or organic.   My friend ordered one of the actual meals while I ordered one of the green drinks, I believe it was the one with chocolate flavor. Anyways, my drink tasted horrible. Maybe it was too healthy but I couldn't swallow it. If you are into this type of thing, maybe its for you. My friend ordered something I believe with the eggs and it was ok.  The environment is very nice. When we went the place was booming so I have no complaints there. The staff is friendly and it gives off a healthy, clean, fitness vibe. I think you just have to be into this type of food. It's a different taste which I don't like but many health buffs will like. Maybe I will try a different food so I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I will update this review once I try something different and will take pictures of what I ordered.",

The restaurant has a great, clean interior space and is an awesome place to swing by for lunch.   **Biggest perk is their menu provides macros for all their items!! I don't know how accurate it is, but it beats me having to ballpark all my food items when I add it into MyFitnessPal app :)  - I ordered the albacore tuna salad (2/5) which was basically a whole lot of lettuce and tuna. Very dry and uninteresting. I wish I opted for the ahi tuna salad instead. - He ordered the bison burger (5/5) with sweet potato french fries (4/5) (doesn't come with it so make sure you add for $1.99) He's not much of a health nut as I am, but he loved the burger! Said he would order again. - I also ordered the acai sorbet bowl (5/5) for a little dessert. This was a simple acai with the usual fruits and granola, but the sorbet was so delicious!! I would imagine it perfect on a hot, summer day. I'd ordered again.  I knocked off a star because for casual/informal dining, I think they're pretty pricey. Some of the burgers are $14.99, which is pricing for restaurants that actually include fries with their burger.",

We order pancakes and the breakfast burrito every time we visit LV, we are from LA. It never ever fails! The dish taste exactly the same every time, and this has been a long journey starting from 2016!   Their staff is very friendly and the place is always clean, I love fitness and in order to acquire a good healthy physique you need discipline and consistency. This place takes their discipline and consistency to the next level!  The chocolate veggiechino is my all time favorite, I've also tried their build your own plate and it's delicious as well.   All their smoothies are delicious in my opinion.  I'll always and forever be a loyal customer!",

I was afraid the chocolate smoothie would be too dense and heavy but how wrong I was. It was light, moreish and delicious!! It was actually my partners drink but I tried to claim it for myself. All the flavours were distinguishable and it was a great little caffeine booster after a hard gym class. I also loved the coffee bean/ chocolate bits in there. The green shake was also really tasty, however I thought it'd be more fruity than leafy. They are quite pricey but competitive when you think about other places and a good size. Plus it's pretty much a meal as it keeps you full for ages and $6-7 for a meal is not bad at all!  Customer service was great and the ladies were chatty and friendly. Will definitely return for my new favourite smoothie!",

The employee who helped me was really informative. I built my own plate: bison patty with avocado and brown rice. What makes it so tasty are the sauces. I got their teriyaki sauce for my patty and the lemon sauce for my avocado. I asked for medium rare and it came out perfectly pink. The area was clean as well and they blast their AC. The reason I took off one star was because the food did take awhile, I waited 10-15 min and I feel like the food is a little overpriced for what you get. A bison burger was a few dollars less than my plate and I would have gotten more. All together I spent a little over $15 for the plate. All in all, it was great and I would definitely come again.",

I had just had my teeth professionally whitened and was told I could not eat any foods or beverages with color, what so ever. Only white or clear foods would be allowed for the next 48 hours. I expressed this \"odd situation\" when it was my turn to order. Next thing I knew Mark (the cashier at the time) and I had concocted an egg white with feta cheese omelet and a side of straight up, plain Jane jicama fries. Though it may not have been the most delicious culinary outtake you have ever heard of, it was a creative and accommodating dish that served up well in my time of need. And it tasted pretty good in the big scheme of things. Thank you again for the great attitude and customer service experience it required to solve my colorless food dilemma.",

I saw other people enjoying their meals. I would say nothing was wrong with the food at all. It was made fresh and with good looking ingredients. I just think as of now, I'm more on a juicing/smoothie kick. The open plan of the kitchen was nice to be able to see your food being made in front of you.

I had briefly looked over their menu and was interested in trying a juice and the Acai bowl. Once I got there I realized that I was more hungry than I thought so I decided to order their breakfast burrito, the Acai bowl and the watermelon and strawberry juice smoothie. The total was like 18 bucks, damn! Anyway, the juice was fine. The burrito had no flavor whatsoever. They give you a little salsa on the side to spice it up, but even that was not sufficient. Eggs just need butter and salt, and this contained none of that. The acai bowl was good, and I have been back about three times to order it again. Others the that, it really is expensive and not as flavorful as I would have liked.",

The meat was seasoned perfectly and everything about it was delicious.  I realized that it takes time to prepare good quality delicious food. I will be going back, and I don't care how long my food takes, because it is well worth the wait. And what a friendly staff!!",

Fortunately for me things have improved and I do realize that each location varies.   I've been to this particular location twice now on a Saturday and Monday and I'm very pleased so far. I've been ordering their egg white scramble turkey breakfast and a green chia seed smoothie with added protein and I must say that it's pretty darn amazing.  I love eating at a place where I am aware of the ingredients are in my food and where they give a precise calories count of each dish. It definitely makes life easier for me.  I also love that this healthy place doesn't cost an arm and a leg for super delicious and fresh food. This has become my favorite place to eat breakfast and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to eat healthy.  Way to go G&P!!!",

I recently started going there for breakfast as well.  I usually get a Green Shake and its pretty effing delicious.  HIGHLY recommended and some eggs with turkey sausage.  I stand by my next comment, very strongly. BY FAR THE BEST SAUSAGE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!  Also, huge bonus, they have chalula packets to go...really makes life easier.",

I ended up ordering a regular medium cooked angus burger with avocado and fries. My friend had ordered the build your own chicken bowl. His order had come out within 7-8 minutes while mine was 22 minutes (only know because I checked in when I sat down). Being a good friend he waited for me but after 10 minutes I told him go ahead and eat.  He finished his entire meal before I received my lunch. On top go receiving my lunch, the burger was cooked over well and had lost a great deal of moisture. Which was disappointing considering I was extremely hungry and there was only us in the establishment. The sweet potato fries were excellent  Will definitely give this place another try after leaving a sour taste in my mouth the first time",

Just as my pescatarian palette has both expanded and been fine tuned over the years, I could say the same for the menu at Greens & Proteins.  It too has expanded and been fine tuned to peak my interest and I like it.   From a great non-salty bowl of hot, fresh lentil soup for cheap and an Impossible Burger (that was OK, but not quite as juicy as others I have had out there on the planet), I was glad I chose to revisit this healthy eatery.  Caleb's Kola on their soda self serve soda gun made my husband happy too (I like it when he eats better but barely knows it at places like this where the food is just that good).   Some outdoor casual seating, great options across their menu for me to try on future visits, bright & airy atmosphere, this is a great healthy meal spot near my hood.  I am glad I returned after all these years.",

I ordered breakfast Turkey broccoli frittata and my boyfriend had their angus beef burger cooked Medium.  Well I guess the lady wasn't having a good day and she asked if my boyfriend wanted a fried egg on his burger too??  He's declined. I guess he took it as a negative attitude.  There were no clean tables and the floor was sticky by my feet. I couldn't believe there wasn't someone cleaning the lobby the way it was.  We picked the least filthiest table with a few crumbs and it was fine.  Food came out popping hot and looked delicious!  His burger smelled amazing and I fell in love with the frittata.  It was very filling and I loved the spinach salad on the side it was definitely more than I expected on a plate.  The prices were reasonable for the freshness.  My boyfriend however was a little upset his food was over cooked and said it was like chewing leather. He wanted his medium and it was cooked well done.  He was hungry so he ate it. He said the sweet potatoes fries were heavy and uncooked (raw). He prefers a delightful crunch and he said they were wet.",

    "text": "Overrated, overpriced, and a complete waste of money. I ordered the veggie wrap on a spinach tortilla and added feta cheese to it, with the side being tofu fries. Tofu fries were ok, they appeared to have some sort of seasoning on them but still didn't have much flavor. They are served with some kind of sauce that was ok, but had a very light flavor, so it didn't really add much to the \"fries\". The wrap is supposed to have lettuce, artichoke hearts, squash, zucchini, portobello mushrooms, pesto, asparagus, some sort of puree, and pesto. It was mainly lettuce. Literally on one very END of the wrap was one half slice of zucchini and one half slice of squash, with no other in the rest of the wrap. In one half of the wrap were random tomatoes. No pesto to speak of and no bean puree, completely dry. I was charged a whole DOLLAR to add feta cheese and there was BARELY any throughout the whole thing. The asparagus bits were so hard and undercooked I nearly broke a tooth biting into it. It appeared they took one tiny slice of the smallest portobello mushroom imaginable and cut it into micro-bites and sprinkled it on only on half of the wrap. It was thrown together like they were in a hurry, yet there was only one other table in the place and they were already eating. I took the majority of it to go, but apparently when they either steamed or sauteed the bit of squash and zucchini, they didn't drain it because there was water all over the bottom of the container when I got home, which made the wrap incredibly soggy and fell apart trying to hold it. Seriously, a 6 year old could have done a better job with this food, all for the bargain price of $11 (after adding cheese). If you feel the urge to order this, make your life easier and take $11, go to Walmart and buy the most wilted head of lettuce you can find, and burn the rest of the money left over.",

I'm never disappointed, the food is always fresh, delicious, and the same quality no matter the location!   If your looking for clean healthy food, this is one of the best places in town! They have a great create your own menu, as well as a wide array of meals to suite all your needs, whether you have dietary restrictions, or your simply just trying to watch what you eat, you will be sure to feel great about your food choices, yet enjoy a delicious, health conscious meal.   It's a great place to bring a vegan friend because they have a whole vegan and raw menu, aside from all their proteins for meat lovers to indulge in as well. The pizza are also amazing, I love the veggie pizza with the vegan  mozzarella ( not in not vegan) but it's super tasty , topped with their balsamic reduction! The ahi tacos are delicious as well!  Today I went with one of my favorites, the lean bison cheesesteak wrap, with low fat mozzarella, a great post work out meal! I always sub my Jicama fries for sauteed kale! It's truly satisfying every time!   The energy and vibe is just as amazing as the food, friendly staff and a clean environment! Can't make it in? Don't worry they are on post mates as well! Thank me later!",

    "text": "They never once said \"sorry.\"  I usually order through door dash delivery, but this time I was on my way home from work so I decided to pick up instead... Boy do I regret that decision, never again will I approach this place unless it's delivery, why? Horrible customer service ran by a bunch of untrained, inexperienced staff. After ordering from door dash for PICK UP, I arrive at 5:45 PM to pick up my five items. The gentlemen greeted me, and I told him I was picking up for Door Dash. He looked at the pile of to-go container bags, chose one, and handed me the bag but there was a problem, there was only one item. I asked where the other items were... He glanced at the door dash app on the wall and realized he didn't punch in the other 4 items. Without saying anything (no wait, he mumbled something under his breath), he touches the buttons on the Point of Sale terminal, turns leaves towards the kitchen. I stood there waiting alone for a good 15 seconds and said \"So I guess I'll wait then?\" I really wasn't sure what to do because I was told or explained anything. Literally only two words got exchanged. After I spoke, a female employee walks up to the counter and asks what I would like. The dark haired employee shouts \"I got him,\" and the woman says nothing. Stares at me. I smile back and said, \"I'll uh go wait over there.\" It was so awkward, it just felt like I did something wrong. Sorry I ruined your day for coming in.  So I wait there from 5:45 until 6:12, after already inputting my order in almost an hour ago. The dark haired employee handed me the food. Never said sorry, but said, \"Here.\" I look into the bag, and there was still missing an item. Before I said anything and before leaving, the female employee walks towards and hands me the last item. After that I leave, frustrated. The food was still decent. No complaints there. I love their cheese burger wrap!  I would frequent here a lot because of the healthy options that this place has especially after being diagnosed with cancer, so I can't really travel to this restaurant and use door dash delivery. But with the delivery option, there is almost no issues but like I said I regret that I decided to deal with their staff directly. I think the problem is, the employees at Greens and Proteins thought I was a Door Dash employee but not a regular customer. This needs to change. I probably will not order here again and tell my family not to come here either. More and more other healthy options have been coming out and I would rather take my money elsewhere because their staff certainly doesn't care about spending mine at Greens and Proteins.",

    "text": "I came here last night for dinner, and I also have come here dozens of times before and am always satisfied. I often order take out, and they are always quick to answer the phone and prepare my order. This is a great place to eat in as well since there are always open tables (inside and outside on the patio), and I do really like their complementary cucumber water for eating in.   I come here when I am looking for a macro-friendly healthy and delicious meal. I love the Bison Burger, Chicken Sausage Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and Chicken Cheese Steak (with lettuce wrap) since these are all filling, healthy (lower calorie), and tasty options. For their sides, I love their tofu fries and their buffalo chicken strips. I also love to get steamed broccoli or asparagus with their reduced balsamic vinaigrette (so yummy!)  For dessert, I'd recommend the granola crusted whole wheat french toast since it's tasty, relatively healthy and not overly sweet.   Sometimes, the menu can be confusing with macro/calorie counting especially with the different options for wraps/burgers, etc (lettuce wrap, whole wheat bun, etc.) I would also like if they showed the macros for the sides as well such as for the jicama fries, sweet potato fries. I haven't had their smoothies, but watch out since they tend to be on the more caloric side.   This place is great and a \"go to\" if you are looking for a healthy, guilt-free meal that still hits the spot.",

    "text": "Before I placed my order, I asked the girl at the register what Greens and Proteins specialties are and she said make your own plate, and the BBQ chicken pizza. I decided on the pizza.   My order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a \"traditional\" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.  Towards the end of my meal, I called over the manager to give him some feedback. While I appreciated him sitting down with me and having an open conversation, I did not like the fact that he said normally I would offer a refund but in this case I don't think we did anything wrong. I wasn't asking for a refund just offering my honest feedback.   Overall, I like the concept of the restaurant and I am willing to come back to try more items on the menu.",

Next the Margherita Pizza (about 10\" across / enough for 2 people to eat) was just like any other you can get and the Thai Chicken Peanut Satays sounded appealing.

    "text": "Came here one day for lunch with a friend (actually come to think of it, it was before the Brooklyn Bowl event) XD   Margherita Pizza (Low-fat mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and basil) - To my surprise, i didn't know there was roasted garlic in this. If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X  Bison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....) Im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it, i didnt feel so healthy. LOL    Overall, nice place. A bit on the pricey side. These two items added up to i believe around $24? I guess a price to pay for fresh/organic? ingredients. May try other things next time since i think i picked the fattiest item on the menu.",

    "text": "Had to stop into a place that holds two of my most prominent diet words in it's name. I really wish I had more time to try more of the menu, but, very limited amount of time in Vegas.  That said, the breakfast that was served to the table next to me looked amazing and I can't wait to try it.  This go around though, hammered down on the \"build my own\" with ostrich (check another animal off my \"got ya bitch\" list of animals consumed!), sketti squash and some mashed sweet taters. Also got an antioxidant blast smoothie (berry mix).  So, the chow. Ostrich - very lean, and decent. Tried it without the citrus bbq sauce first, and it was ok. Was hoping for a bit of seasoning or something, but, it was just cooked meat and no seasoning help. With the citrus bbq, not bad at all and solid chunk of meat. Texture was and cooked temp were not bad either. All in all, a solid slab of lean meat.  Sketti squash - tasteless and didn't seem to be cooked enough. Was very disappointed in this one. I'm usually a huge fan of this and make it my own quite a bit (gives me something to do when my madre delivers 12 giant squashes from her garden). But, a little citrus bbq made it tolerable to wolf down like a desert coyote.  Mashed sweet taters - very good. Was really happy to see this on the menu as a carb option. I hadn't had them in a while, and was pleasantly surprised to have a solid plate of mashed sweets. Perfectly fluffy, not stringy (which sweet taters can be when mashed thanks to the fibers), and solid flavor. Only thing missing was a chance to throw some cinnamon on them. If you've  never done that before, give it a go. Fantastic. I promise.  Antioxidant smoothie - Great flavor, miss on the texture. I knew it'd be a bit think and chunky thanks to the apples (without an amazing juicer, apples are a prick to deal with). But, was hoping this place would have a juicer that'd take that away. Not so.   In any event, smoothie and food rang up over $24. Considering the ingredients and if I were to order something similar elsewhere, I'm sure it'd be close to that too. So, not overly fussy with the price.",

The food is delicious and doesn't seem overly salty like so many restaurants. The nutrition and macronutrient info is on the menu by each item which makes it super helpful for those of us who keep track of that stuff! The only odd thing that I noticed was they didn't have any natural sweeteners (like honey or stevia), only white sugar and artificial stuff. A place that prides itself on health should probably start offering better options! But, it didn't affect me that day or anything so not holding it against them. The servers were friendly and the menu is quite extensive. I'd love to come back and try the smoothies and some of their other items!",

Maybe I need to go here more than once...but with the prices..maybe not. =/  Anyways...my boyfriend and I wanted to start eating healthier. We're not health freaks but we don't want to become obese one day either. He heard about this place through his co workers. The thought of \"making your own meal\" intrigued him so we were willing to give it a try. We walked in knowing their prices were on the higher end side.  We both decided to get the \"make your own meal\" plate. To sum it up, PORTIONS ARE SMALL. It was actually perfect for me because I get full easily anyways but for all you \"big eaters\"...be warned. This MAY NOT fill you up. Yes, it IS a healthy restaurant afterall. Yes, the whole point in small portions is because it is healthy for you. But I'm just saying....  It may fill me up but PERSONALLY, it still left something for me to desire.  We also got two drinks. He got that green drink (sorry forgot the name of it but I've seen a lot of Yelpers get it) and I got the berry antioxidant smoothie. They tasted different...but a good different. Man....after drinking this, it puts Jamba Juice and Tropical Smoothie to shame. Greens and Proteins smoothie drinks tasted natural and healthy. You can tell it has natural ingredients and fresh fruits and veggies...unlike all the other sugar and crap that maybe be in Jamba and Tropical.  So why 3 stars and not a higher rating?  -2 stars for the price. It seriously pays to be healthy. =/ I think with 2 drinks and 2 meals ran our bill to $30+ ....for that price, we could have went to Cheesecake Factory lol   Will we be back? Ehh....maybe...",

I ordered a tuna salad to go and it was less than a cup of made salad and probably less than 2oz of tuna within the salad. The rest of the salad consisted of extra large diced vegetables.  I was very disappointed with the cost and portion size for mediocre food.",

    "text": "You come here for a reason...lifestyle food that is not available at most places.  It is no coincidence that it is located next to LVAC.  Greens and Proteins has lots of high protein meats, low-fat options, vegetarian options, vegan options, good grains, and gluten free options to fit several lifestyle diets.  I am a fan of their buffalo meat steak & cheese wrap and their green shake specifically, but if you're looking for the types of food offered here it is easy to find something on the menu.  They also provide caloric and fat content info on their menu.  Don't come here if you are not into lifestyle food.  It will most likely disappoint.  There are plenty of tasty items for all types of eater, but you're paying a little more here because of the type of food.  Also, several of the healthy options are a bit bland...ie jicama fries.  It is still a solid place that is filling a niche and doing it pretty well.",

I had the bison burger and it's by far my all time favorite burger!! Everything is fresh and the meat is just perfect. I also enjoy the wellness green juice. Every now and then I call and schedule it to pick up. The guy that's usually there is a young man named Raul that always takes good care of us and makes sure that our food and juices are top notch. Excellent customer service by him and the rest of the greens and proteins team. By the way get the sweet potatoes fries!!!! You go g&p!",

    "text": "It was a boring Sunday, as I had nothing to do and no mood to go somewhere to hang out. I decided to cook something for breakfast and \"BANG\" absolutely no ideas. Then I called my friend for advice and to chat a little. After analyzing all the recipes my friend had another \"BANG\" idea and that was Greens and Proteins. She told me \"just go there\". We decided to go there together, as if I wouldn`t like that place then the whole responsibility will lay on her and she'd have to feed me and cheer me up.   Finally we got there. SURPRISE! Healthy food!  You shouldn't count calories anymore as these guys had made it for you. You can even remove calorie calculator from your phone. Our order was greek scramble, BBQ chicken pizza on lavash, spinach with tofu fries and two watermelon and strawberry smoothies. While food was being prepared, I went to the internet to find out what lavash is. It is a very thin bread widely spread in Caucasus and motherland is Armenia. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLavash&s=4a182c8e471171b4b1745fd8fdd67246390ecbb74c9c8787bbf819ae5064d90d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La...</a> , they don't use yeast to make it and this is good. We got our food after about 15 minutes. All I can say about it is that it's great. Smoothie was very refreshing. You feel how you just did something good for yourself, have a lot of energy and could go for a run at the gym. These guys really need to add a couple of treadmills.   Service was good as well. Guys were attentive and helpful with wide smiles on their faces. Overall good place with good food, service and perfect as hell smoothies.  Will definitely come back and try all of their smoothies.   What an artistic review, I think I have revealed some writer skills in me.",

You can also see them cutting up fresh fruit and veggies in between orders. I have yet to venture out into their other drinks, but I did recently try their Breakfast Burrito that definitely fueled me post-workout. I know a lot of people say this place is over-priced, but healthy ingredients are generally pricier and what you are really paying for is the convenience and knowing/seeing your food is freshly prepared. And......they have packets of Cholula for to-go!",

The execution can be a bit spotty and the food, while decent, won't make you forget about all the unhealthy (and more delicious) alternatives around town. The BBQ pizza was ok, but the crust was too soft and doughey. The bison cheesesteak wrap was good but I couldn't help but fantasize about biting into a real Philly cheesesteak while eating it. The girl behind the counter raved about the tofu fries but I wasn't a fan. I've never been much of a tofu fan and the fries failed to convert me.  My favorite part of their menu is the \"Build your own custom meal\" where you pick a protein, grain, green, and sauce of your choosing. It's perfect for when you want a quick meal, don't feel like cooking, and aren't in the mood for traditional fast food. The pork tenderloin with the balsamic reduction was good, but the portabello mushroom was overcooked. Portion sizes are on the small side so don't expect to walk away full.   There may be some drawbacks to this place, but it's still a good option for a quick meal.",

I ordered the angus burger with lettuce pocket (instead of bun) with tofu fries.  Angus burger was fine, not salty which is good.  The tofu fries were salty because of the seasoning.  So healthwise, its kind of a wash with the tofu fries lol.  My wife ordered the build your own with angus patty, kale, and sweet potato mash.  She seemed to enjoy it because the kale was steamed and not sodium bombed.  She also ordered a ginger limeade which was too sweet for her taste.  The price was surprisingly high as all the above came out to 35 bucks (with tip).  So although we feel the food is relatively healthy, the price and distance from our home is a small obstacle for consistent repeat business..",

My husband is EXTREMELY gluten sensitive  (it's not a fad, but a really big deal, like an allergy) and when trying to explain this to the guy at the counter he became impatient and huffy. I am not sure if he was the manager or what, but regardless of how busy you are, you need to maintain a certain level of professionalism and care about people, especially food allergies. He was dismissive and after we ordered, I was sure they didn't prepare his food correctly. I ordered an albacore salad and it was just \"okay\". My husband had requested just a bed of rice with bison and veggies, I believe it may have been a custom order. He really liked his, and didn't have a reaction to any of the food, which is a thumbs up. I hate to leave negative reviews but I just wasn't feeling after the guy was a little abrasive. I WILL go back again because I know people have good and bad days and life happens. The smoothie I had was great however. It was a pretty busy place so I look forward to trying it again. Will update review then.",

The Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito caught my eye; the idea sounded interesting, and so did its description: scrambled tofu and soy chorizo, tomatoes, cilantro, and Anaheim chilies, wrapped in a spinach tortilla. A side of tofu home fries originally comes with this, but you can replace that with another side listed on their menu. Also, you can choose to sub the tortilla with lettuce. With that being said, the burrito only looks good on paper. In this case, I would've preferred actual meat than the tofu because of the spices and ingredients.   One cool thing to mention about this place is that the calories for each of the menu items -- excluding breakfast -- are listed. Prices for foods seem reasonable, much more reasonable than other \"healthy\" eateries by my gym. They do make smoothies and juices here, but I think $7.50 for a smoothie is too much, even with a Yelp check-in for $1.00 off.",

    "text": "I'm super disappointed with my experience with this business. I placed an online order using this app a few days ago when I visited Vegas. First of all, they called me and told me that the soup I ordered was not available due to a broken blender and politely offered a turkey chili, which seemed fine, until he said it would cost me an additional $2. No thank you, I kindly responded. He offered to deliver the parfaits I ordered and claimed he would give me a credit for the soup, which seemed great. Until I checked my bank account. At first, I figured maybe the double charge was accidentally, until it fully posted to my bank account. I contacted the bank and they claim they are both legitimate charges. So let me break it down for everyone- my first charge (soup included) was 23.58, the second was for 17.62. I literally was charged $41 for two little parfaits.",

I had an allergic reaction to the pecans which I would have avoided had I known the allergen information. I didn't bother mentioning anything to employees since we needed to leave to deal with my reaction before it got worse. What kind of food provider doesn't list allergen information?   Otherwise, the food tasted reasonably ok. We would have perhaps returned as we're trying to create healthier eating habits and also enjoy trying new things. The service was mediocre and the beverage selection was oddly limited. We obviously won't return due to the allergy issue.",

My bf and I go eat brunch maybe once a week usually the same place, but were trying to be healthier so this seemed cool however far from our house.     The staff is incredible. Polite over achievers, really happy smiling bunch. Giving us samples as we waiting for the previous family decide their order.   Green ginger lime juice was delicious. And a huge size compared to other similar joints. I got the turkey burger on wheat. Huge fresh patty grilled bun vegan cheese heirloom tomato not your average turkey burger. Tofu fries are very seasoned looking but not overwhelmingly spicy. Quite mild Could stand to bump up the heat a little even. Comes on a triangle plate which was fun.   Bf got the chicken satay. Delicious good size portion excellent plating. Complimentary cucumber water probably was the highlight of it all for me. Id come back just for that. Stiff uninviting tables when you dine in but they're surpringly comfortable.",

I like coming here when I'm craving for burgers because they have Bison meat which tastes great! I've also had their Philly Cheesesteak as well which is equally delicious. The last time I was here I had their flatbread pizza it was pretty tasty.   I do love this concept but I wish they would give you a choice of a side salad instead of Jicama strips. I only like Jicama with hot sauce and vinegar. I also wish they would blend their drinks a little better. I ordered a green drink and a peeling or something got stuck in my throat.  It wasn't pleasant but before that the drink was good! I'm sure this was just a freak accident.",

I tried the Margherita pizza and the Green Leaf Berry Blast.   The Margherita pizza was simple but delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella cheese and slices of tomato with bits of basil garnishing. I wish I had gotten the gluten free version though! - I really love how they have the gluten free option. The portion was probably good for sharing with one other person.   The smoothie was alright. The taste was leaning more towards the spinach and kale which I wasn't really fond of. I do love kale though but it was probably the spinach that was giving it a weird flavor. I'd give it a 3/5.   There was also complimentary cucumber water which was a refreshing touch. The place itself is pretty spacious and busy but the service was fast and the workers were very nice. I'm glad that this place is close by my neighborhood. I will definitely stop by again to try the other foods. They also have an ostrich burger which I don't think I'll be trying anytime soon lol.",

I've had this place bookmarked forever and wanted to give it a go.. The only thing is I'm doing a detox which means no food so I just went with him to watch him eat and take big whiffs of his food LOL It is located right by LVAC on Flamingo/215 which is the perfect location for it. Everyone eating at G&P looks like either they just worked out, are about to work out or like they love working out.. Very healthy, clean and fresh feel to the place. You order at the counter and someone brings your food out to you. Everything on the menu looks so good and I love how they have the calorie count for everything.   My man ordered:  _The build your own protein plate with chicken breast ($9.99,) broccoli, cous cous and bbq sauce- I thought it was going to be a small portion but it was more than enough and it looked delicious~ _Hummus plate ($5.99) - comes with plain hummus and roasted pepper hummus, served with soft pita and crunchy lavosh~ _Green Shake Smoothie ($7.50) - I love how they don't add sugar to their smoothies... This smoothie in particular is over 600 calories though!!! But it is loaded with all the good stuff. I had some sips of this.. It's very rich & creamy and definitely would a great meal replacement!   My bf said everything was very tasty and he had plenty left over..The prices are actually very reasonable compared to other \"healthy\" places and they cater to vegan, raw, gluten free and HCG diets! The service was great here too! Especially the guy who brought the food out.. Even though the silverware is self-serve by the fountain drinks he offered to go get them for my boyfriend and checked up on us a couple times~   I can't wait to actually eat here!!! aghhhhhh",

    "text": "I have been meaning too get this off my bookmark tonight finally did. I always heard about the location on the opposite end of world for me. Once learned about there newest location excited about chance too get my Greens and Proteins on. I no means hardcore comes too healthy eating but generally try all my meals healthy. Truly is no place better in Vegas comes too healthy menu. Literally they breakdown the calories on just about every menu item. Offer Build Your Own Custom Meal pick your proteins, greens, grains, and sauces. Again they have everything broken down too calories. It was my first time daunting too pick choose as my first taste. I kind of in the mood of burger so went with the Ostrich Burger and try so got the 7 Vegetable Broccoli Cheese Soup.   The soup was good. It nothing Wow factor but overall solid soup. It nice creamy base soup but had nice thickness and full body with the cheese (assume cheddar they use. The color really nice. Times order any vegetable soup not have that vibrant or look like vegetable. Soup was right on. Nice HOT!!  The Ostrich Burger was delicious. I believe one first times having it. It lean meat. So thinking might be dried out but still moist and had nice flavor. The garnishes of lettuce and tomatoes really fresh looking added too my burger. The sides lot too choose from but went with the fried tofu. I scared at first. I enjoy tofu but not seasoned right just bland. The fried tofu was hit for me. It had nice seasonings on the outside and enjoy the aioli dipping sauce for them. They also offer Bison as protein. I see that in my future...  They cook everything too order so takes time but very much worth the wait. The only thing not fan of is the interior is REALLY boring. I understand still relatively new but plain white walls all around and not much of vibe inside. It loses appeal waiting but once you get your food more then MAKES up for it. It kind of pricey menu. Still not going too hold me back try more of the menu.",

    "text": "Wow...A new location and all reviews are 5 Stars.  Albeit only 3 reviews, this is a new location on the Westside (i.e. the best side, throwing up the W!!).  If you read my review of the Eastern location, I too gave them 5 stars.  However, it's easy to dismiss these posts as biased ones since there is so little reviews.  I had to investigate because that's what I do.     I am a fan of Greens & Proteins and one complaint about them is price.  Most of the items on the menu are pricey and to be honest, don't have much taste either.  Keep in mind, G&P is healthy and that includes you to have an healthy wallet. I'm not a baller by any means, but will splurge when quality proteins is what my body needs.  I also use to have food delivered to my home via \"Eat to Grow\".  This was pricey too and taste is only for the desirable.  I made my biggest gains on these meals and G&P is no different.   I've tried their Salmon and Ostrich Burgers in the past.  At this location, I opted to try their Turkey.  You get 8 oz of clean protein and less fat with their Turkey Burger.  This meal is also served with their Jicama fries.  The turkey was pretty good, but the fries is something that made it into the basura with the quickness. After Lent, I will definitely come back for their Filet Mignon.    I gave the other location 5 stars, but had to drop this location to 4 stars.  This G&P is more spacious, but missing that ambiance that the Eastern location has. Great people watching at the Eastern location.  Because this location is new, the staff is also new.  Knowledge is power and a newbie staff can mean weakness.  When I order at places like this, I like to know how much the servings are like protein count, total ounces, etc.  The staff actually had to go to the back and ask.  They also didn't know if they served fat-free ranch.  I know, I'm just getting picky but these are the things most health driven restaurants would know.  I'm sure by the next visit, they'll be more prepared. Thus, I will probably up their rating back to 5 stars.   Still a fan of Greens and Protein.  Don't be surprised if you see multiple check in's from me at this joint.  This is a new and more spacious location.  I'm sure within the next couple of months, the word will be out and the ambiance will mimic what the Eastern location provides.",

The place was one of the healthiest \"fast food\" restaurants I've seen, and the prices were pretty damn affordable for what you get. I decided to skip the juice and get a pick your own meal with ahi tuna, sauted kale, and brown rice, with a spicy peanut sauce. It was all delicious and felt really healthily prepared.  Even better, the guy taking my order was super friendly and took my Yelp checkin offer. He ended up getting tipped, so it probably cost me more to use it lol. All in, the meal was around $13-$14 and was well worth it. I hope this place adds more locations, because I'm rarely that far away from the strip.",

I asked if he could make me a peanut butter banana instead. He came back with a better tasting concoction. Way to do service recovery. Thumbs up to Kevin (the worker who saved the night.)  Update: All I drank after the gym was the shakes. I ended up tasting them again...Something in those drinks just didn't agree with me. My girlfriend has the chorizo wrap and didn't have any issues.

They look and taste like something that cook at home, and let me tell you I'm not a great cook. I guess if you need gluten free items or if you are vegan this place offers an extended menu. However, you are also going to need to pay a bit more for it!  I ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap with tofu fries and they were just so chewy! And let me just add that I love tofu, but they really dropped the ball on that one",

    "text": "Plastic is a great material, but I would rather not have it in my smoothie.  While visiting this location yesterday, I purchased a berry smoothie for my five year old and a Green Ginger Limeade smoothie for myself.   While drinking my smoothie I felt an odd texture in my mouth, thinking it was a piece of a hard leaf of some sort , I chewed it only to find that it did not break up into smaller pieces as expected. When I pulled it out of my mouth it was a small piece of plastic that was the equivalent of laying 3 grains of rice end to end. I showed it to the very kind young lady who rang me up earlier and she said she was sorry and that she would share my finding with the manager.   Thinking that this was just a fluke, I continued to sip my drink, only to find another piece of plastic about one fourth the size of the first. I went to the counter and asked to speak with a manager. The woman I was addressing informed me that she was the manager. I then explained that this was the second piece of plastic I had sucked through my straw. And she said that the night before, she had seen a piece of plastic in the grapes while they were removing the grapes from their packaging. She made a circle with her hand to show me the approximate size of said plastic piece,(approximately the size of a quarter), then went on to state that since it was clear, that made it very difficult to sort out of the grapes.   I have visited this location in the past and had no issues. The employees and the manager were very pleasant and friendly during this visit. My problem is with the fact that the manager stated that she saw the plastic in the grapes, yet she did not take the time to stop the process of cleaning them in order to fish out the piece of plastic.  I can only think about the many health conscious patrons who come here expecting to have a healthy treat as I did.  In fact, her own baby ( that looked to be approximately 4 to 5 months old) was enjoying a smoothie and I just hate to think that someone else's child could have choked on that piece of plastic.   In the future, I would suggest fishing the plastic out and training the employees to also keep a watchful eye for things that should not be present among the fruits and vegetables they juice. This whole thing could have been avoided by a very simple precaution.",

    "text": "So, I have eaten here quite a few times and have pretty much been happy with the food.  There has been one exception; in which I had ordered tuna tartar and the taste was questionable, I found it very stringy and fishy.  This time, my husband stopped in and asked if I wanted him to bring me, something home.  I ordered the Tofu fries; which are my favorite thing on the menu and the chicken satay.  Fail and fail.  The tofu fries were overcooked and they neglected to send the dipping sauce which is half the taste.  I had the same feeling about the chicken satay.  Way over cooked.  It was not grilled but pan fried. Not sure if it was double cooked or reheated but definitely disappointing.  Food here is not on the cheap side at all and it just sucks that you pay a premium for bad food.  They used to be one of the few clean, healthy places to eat but since others have opened up, I think I will look for a new place.",

I'll preface with our experience the one time we came in about 30 min before closing... we try not to do this because we understand we \"hate\" the customers that come in right before closing. On that visit, we understood why our food might of seemed rushed (wrap was wrapped loosely, pizza was not as yummy, etc).   Today, we came in around 5pm. Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and a wrap. I'm not exaggerating... it seemed like they forgot the BBQ on the \"BBQ chicken pizza!!!\" There were only BBQ on 2 of the 8 slices!!! I don't quite understand how that can happen.  Next, We ordered \"add avocado\" on the wrap.  I'm not sh!tting you... a small single slice was added to one side/corner of the \"cut in half\" wrap.  Last, the wrap was not properly wrapped as it just fell apart.  As a reminder... we go to the location on rainbow often and order the same items. We are definitely going to stop going to this location as every visit is disappointing.  I haven't checked if they are franchised/independently owned between these 2 locations but hopefully they can have more consistency. Until then I'll go elsewhere when around the Flamingo location.",

They are a food and smoothie shop with an open kitchen, but do not have enclosed blenders, so there is a huge amount of noise. Also, they do not appear to have run cycles on the blenders, so someone will turn one on, and walk away to do something else, and leave it running. One was left going for 5 minutes non stop.   The food: to say that it was worth it would be an overstatement. One entree was the shrimp, cous cous and asparagus. For 13 dollars, there were literally 5 shrimp. My cheese steak was greasy to a level that was borderline inedible (It's a cheese steak, so that's par for the course.) The jicama fries tasted like nothing and overall everything was bland and boring.  The food had all of the outward appearances of a place that isn't trying all that hard.    You can get some veggies and protein there that's about as interesting as a subway salad.",

I do have yet to try any of the food, so when I do get around to doing that, I will update my review.    I want to give it more stars, because I have really enjoyed both of the drinks I've purchased at this place.     First time, I had the \"Green Leaf Berry Blast\".   A nice mix of berries and leafy greens.  It came out a sort of purplish-brown color but it really tasted great and filled me up.  The second time, I had the 'Wellness Drink', which is a mixture of green grapes, apples, limes, some other fruits and then a bunch of leafy greens.    The taste was fresh and fantastic, and it really hit the spot after my workout.    So yummy and it has all that good stuff in it.    Customer service was fine both visits.   My drinks were ready in a snap.   The atmosphere of the place is inviting and comfortable and it works with their health-conscious atmosphere.   I could see myself eating here.  So why 3 stars?   I'm deducting one star because at 8 bucks a pop, well it seems a bit pricey for a cup of juice.  But that doesn't keep me away.   The other star I am deducting for 2 reasons.   Lack of nutritional info and the use of agave nectar in every drink offering.   I track everything I take in, and I would think a place that serves up healthy food could offer more than a simple calorie count.  How much sugar is in these drinks?    Macros are important to my lifestyle.   I would like to see a more comprehensive breakdown.  And the agave is extra sweetener that is just unnecessary and really not a healthy choice IMO.  I am eager to try some of the food offerings.    I will update or offer up a better review at that time.",

They have recently revamped their menu making it easier to find the ingredients to their savory menu items. The staff always has a friendly smile on their face and are always willing to help you with anything, no matter if you are a first timer to a veteran. My wife and I hold the green ginger limeade as a staple here. It's a perfect blend of ginger, limeade, and the vegetables a rancher would scoff at. Their food is always seasoned to a T. The grilled vegetable wrap is an awesome choice for those time meat does not not sound appealing, but for those that want to get their meat on, the bison burger will definitely full the void. My personal favorite is the California grille chicken wrap. Don't forget to get your tofu fries! I know that sounds weird to be screaming out loud, but trust me, their sauce definitely will make you a believer.  The place screams come here and study or chill if you feel like it. I definitely will be coming back.",

When I asked if they had any organic produce, the gentleman stated \"some of it\" but couldn't tell me what was, therefore leading me to believe none of it is organic. Call me a food snob all you want, but if you're going to proclaim yourself as a healthy alternative then sell non-gmo, organic foods.",

I have a ridiculous amount of food allergies to watch for, and they're always willing to check labels for me or answer any questions. I like the build your own meal option, but it can be a little pricey depending on what you order. Usually, I order the Angus burger wrapped in lettuce with vegan cheese. Comes out to about $12 with tax, which is reasonable considering the quality of the beef. Also, I love being able to use those substitutes!! The only bummer is the sides they have to choose from ..no soy allowed, so I can't  have tofu fries, and the jicama fries taste like raw potato to me.  Only other option is a vegetable, but honestly? Broccoli with a burger isn't the best. Still giving them a good rating because of the staff, though. Keep it up guys!!",

I called from the parking lot, using my bluetooth, to place a to-go order, I was at the Lifetime fitness on Charleston and just finished my workout (11:45 am). Immediately I was asked if it was okay to put me on a brief hold. I was on hold for over 10 minutes, and by the time they picked up again I was standing right in front of the cashier. She seem annoyed at ME, which is ridiculous because it should be the other way around, and she said, \"our phones are not working properly.\" I placed my tuna salad and chicken quinoa salad and the cashier said in a condescending tone, \"well at least you do not have to wait long for your order because you are ordering salads.\" $19.00 + dollars and on top of it I tipped them 2.00 (which I should have not had I known what other crap I had to endure). Had it not been for the Seven magazine I was reading to occupy my time, I realized 15 minutes had passed and those who ordered after me were already eating or have left. I looked into the kitchen and the two cashiers were talking and \"looking busy.\" I see my salad order just sitting on the counter in the kitchen. I loudly say, \"Is that my salad order I have been waiting for?\" They looked at me as if I am the one being rude and look at the order like it appeared there magically. Since my husband had already had lunch he said he would eat the quinoa salad for dinner. I just got a call from him at 7:30 pm and he said there was GLASS in his salad. I called to inform this location what we had been through. Of course it is not the evening shifts fault and Priscilla, the supervisor I spoke to apologized and offered to buy us new meals but that is not what I want because I am NEVER going to this place again. The Greens and Proteins on Rainbow is closer to me and I usually go there. This was my second and LAST time going to the Flamingo location. If you decide to patronize this venue, be aware and cautious.",

I've tried a few different juices and a few different food items, and it's all been great. I'd eat here all the time if it wasn't so expensive (for me, personally). To get a fancy drink and a meal will cost you about $12-15, which is middle-ground pricing around the city, but I consider coming here more of a splurge.
