    "text": "There are more Vietnamese Restaurants in Las Vegas than in Hollywood or Silverlake, California.   I looked at the Yelp reviews and became determined to sample at least one before leaving.  I chose Lemongrass Cafe because it had the highest amount of reviews than any other in town.   Also, found that some reviewers chose to explain that their new Vietnamese restaurant is even better than this place.   I had to try it.    I arrived about 4 pm on Feb 19th.  There was only one other table being served in the whole restaurant - perfect.  I'm not scared.     The servers barely speak English - another good sign.   I did not like the size of the menu.  Come on,  make a few incredible dishes and leave the books for the library.   I became overwhelmed with choices.  I had to pull out my Vons $10.00 magnifying glasses to read.  The lighting could improve but I'm not so concerned about interior design.  Although the 1950s malt shop/dinner takes away from the rich Vietnamese scents and cultural paraphernalia.    I ordered the vegetarian Pho with tofu #59 - Large $8.95   Also dared to ask for \"make your own shrimp and vegetable rice paper wraps\"  off the menu. I figured he understood that it was for me, but since I did not explain, he brough a huge order for way more than one person and hit me with a $19.70 charge.   Ouch !    My friend Meese ordered the number 39 Pho Tai / Rare Beef Pho - Large 7.95 and a coke.    The off the menu wraps were the best I've ever had.   The noodles were perfectly cooked.  The vegetables, crisp, bright and very fresh.   Plenty of herbs, flowering basil, mint, cilantro, sliced cucumbers, (Boston?) lettuce, and about 20 pieces of perfectly cooked grilled shrimp.   The table had a home made spicy chili - a great compliment for spiciness.   I polished that plate like Homer Simpson eating a box of doughnuts.   The Pho surprisingly was not as hot as I'm used to having it, however, I had no problem with it.  Normally, Pho upon arrival has to be carefully sipped at the beginning, otherwise you end up with charring of your tongue and mouth.   I was able to dive in free from danger and just inhale it RTC Navy style.    I should have asked for the cost of any off menu items.  When the server handed the check to me, there was a little bit of hesitation  and a concerned look in his eyes as if that (*&^%$# ) pulls that stuff all the time.    It is still my fault for not asking the price.   When I return to Vegas, I will definitely explore all the well rated Vietnamese restaurants.",

    "text": "Although I proclaim Vietnamese food is one of my all time favorites, if not the favorite, I can never get myself to go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Growing up with a chef for a dad, and a mom that can rival him in this cuisine, makes me never want to pay for something that they can cook better. Anytime pho is mentioned, I find eight friends lining up at the front door.  Finally giving in and taking the advice of various friends, I came to this converted 50's diner. When you walk in, you are greeted by the conflicting smell of Vietnamese food and the shell of the western world. Not much has changed in aesthetics besides the few scattered Asian trinkets and framed artwork.  The food is a little pricier than you will find in Chinatown, but I do not have to drink a gallon of water to subdue the side effects of MSG overload. I am not saying that they don't use any, it just isn't as noticeable. My group had ordered spring rolls. They were on the small side, but the flavors were all there. I swear I tasted mint in there and that is an ingredient that some places neglect to include and it is a shame. I had ordered the lotus salad. This was exactly what I was craving. Light, flavorful, cool and not greasy. The perfect meal for the summer months. The salad consists of lotus stems, jicama, mint, onions, shrimp, and pork served with a tamarind sauce and shrimp crackers. If you like the Vietnamese version of papaya salad, you would probably like this as well. When it is the middle of July, you will not be in the mood for a big bowl of pho, but know there are still options.",

Smells like the pho joints at home (I grew up in Asia town in SoCal)!   I'm thinking, \"I like this place already.\" I ordered a small Pho Thai and it fed me really well.  There were lots of noodles and onions (which I LOVE) and the broth was clear and had a subtle flavor that I'm normally accustomed to, but it was still yummy, nonetheless.  You can't really f*ck up pho, and  for around $7 it's one of the cheapest places you can get pho in the Vegas area.  My group ordered the chicken spring rolls and they were delicious as well.  The peanut sauce complemented the spring rolls nicely, while the fried, crunchy  egg roll skin inside the spring roll itself added a great contrast in texture.   Their menu is relatively large and has the Vietnamese classics like goi cuon (spring rolls), banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake/omelette), and che ba mau (three-color dessert).    I will return. :)",

Coming from san jose, we usually eat pho at least once or twice a week. Here I haven't eaten pho since i left san jose. But I think i found a new place that is close by and the service is great.

    "text": "I'd like to reiterate everything I've said in the previous review.  This place is nice, well-lit, has soft music, is clean and fairly classy (not hole-in-the-wall-ish), has very very delicious food, friendly and non-overbearing staff, and so forth.  In my last review I mentioned that it was disappointing that they didn't have Vietnamese style sandwiches (banh mi).    But now they do!  And they're actually very good!  The bread is fresh and tasty, and they're pretty liberal with the meat filling, generous with the herbs and spices, and not overwhelming with the pickled daikon and carrots.  The taste is a little different than at Pho Thanh Huong, but the difference will be choosing between Coke and Pepsi instead of choosing between Coke and Crap.  Both are good in their own way, and preference will be simply a matter of taste, and not a matter of quality.  They are $3.75 each, $0.75 more than Pho Thanh Huong.  A few more specific recommendations:    The Pho of course is excellent, and I find it to be the best in Vegas so far.  At $7 for two people, can't beat the price (though other pho places are comparable, of course).  The Lime Soda is to die for!  Lots of sugar, and certainly not something to drink every day, but a must-have once a month or so!  My favorite appetizer is the Vietnamese Crepe, full of pork and shrimp and many other deliciousnesses, but it's a tad pricey at $8.  It's good for the table, though.  Second favorite appetizer is the regular Spring Rolls.  It has a nice crunch, it has both shrimp and pork, lots of vegetables, and of course they have the *best* peanut dipping sauce in any Vietnamese place I've tried yet.  These are only $6.  Go go go to Lemongrass!  I go there often, especially since it's about 9 minutes from my house.",

If I got another banh mi, I would try the fried egg one mmm!",

    "text": "My mom and her friend wanted to try a Vietnamese place, so I found this one. Man, people weren't kidding when they said this was an old-style diner. It screams retro, except a lot of the interior decor is Vietnamese (not including the maneki neko).  I went with a large bowl of pho chin nam. I thought it was a 4/5. Pretty clean broth, nice noodles, but the meat for some reason lacked the depth of flavor that I'm accustomed to in California. Still, it's better than the pho at Pho Kim Long, which is supposed to be the go-to spot in the Vegas area. Also, the utensils - wooden chopsticks and somewhat light plastic - didn't have the solid feel of the tools that I'd wanna use at a pho place.  My mom and her friend had, respectively, a rice noodle dish with pork, shrimp, and egg rolls, and a hu tieu (noodle soup somewhat similar to pho). They didn't find it up to their standards really, maybe a 3/5. In addition, it was kinda annoying that it took pho and hu tieu longer than the noodles to come out. Pho definitely should not take that long to get ready if they have a broth going, which you'd think they would have at lunch hour (12:30).  I decided that the tiebreaker between 3 and 4 stars would be the com bo luc lac (shaking beef), which I often order at Vietnamese restaurants. I took one to-go and (my fault for waiting) the rice was kinda dry by the time I got around to eating dinner, However, I could tell that the rice was good when it was fresh, and the well-seasoned meat and the sauteed veggies were pretty darn good and still had great texture (tender and crunchy, respectively). I'll give it a 4.25/5, taking into account the time elapsed in the to-go box. Maybe it'd be closer to a 5 if It had been fresh, but I can't make that judgment  Locals may wanna note that management changed some time in Dec 2011, so if you didn't like it the last time, you might wanna try it again. This is probably about what you can expect out of a Vietnamese place not in California.",

    "text": "Vegan/Vegetarian friendly!!!!  My family and I go here every week (2-3 times) for their vegetarian pho with vege and tofu (actually vegan because they use vege broth, fresh broccolis, carrots, onions, celery, tofu). You CAN ask for extra veggie and/or tofu for an extra charge. I sometimes do that n get no noddles if I want to eat really light.   I have to warn you, the vege phos usually take a little longer because they actually have to make the broth when you order but it is so worth the wait. It is so light but satisfying for us (note that I am not vegetarian and I order that everytime now). I actually brought some friends (meat eaters and vefetarians) and they enjoyed the vegetarian pho as well!   When i want to endulge myself a bit, I order their vegetarian spring rolls. I love to have them cut the rolls so that I can easily dunk em in the sauce and wrap the little pieces in the lettuce they provide. Well, I ask for extra lettuce, too.  Seriously love this place. I think I have been coming here ever since they opened. I used to have thier meat phos, seafood pho with egg noodles/glass noodles, rice dishes, etc. I recommend this place 100%.",

    "text": "Just, no.    I got food here when I was in town for the weekend with some friends and we stayed at a house nearby.  I got: crispy egg rolls, grilled chicken banh mi, and a side of pho broth.  Egg rolls: Good, fresh, and I like that they were served with the lettuce and fresh mint leaves and cilantro.  Best way to eat them is to wrap them in the lettuce with the herbs and dip into the lemongrass sauce. Yum.  Banh mi: It was the SMALLEST banh mi I have ever seen, AND they charged $6.75 for it.  I've been a regular at various Vietnamese restaurants, both east coast and west coast for years - banh mi's are at least 30-40% bigger than theirs and cost around $4-$5.  Also, the grilled chicken inside was weirdly chopped up and not good quality.   Pho broth: This was the coup de grace of any good impression this restaurant could have made.  The broth tasted just like the CANNED beef broth you get at Asian supermakets with maybe some star anise added in - there was no depth or richness of flavor that comes from hours of simmering beef bones.  I will bet anyone $100 that this place doesn't make its stock the legit way.   It gets 2 stars because the service was friendly and because it inhabits what obviously used to be a Silver Diner - their food is definitely still better than whatever Silver Diner had.",

So I walk in...it's pretty empty. I never like empty restaurants, it tells me what's going to come, normally a very bad time. No one was there to greet, so I decided to sit at the bar since I was dining alone that night. There was about ten customers total in this place. Took a while for someone to give me a menu, even though the waitresses passed me multiple times. After finally looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try their spring rolls, and I really wanted a sandwich. Wanted to try the veggie Bahn Mi. After she brings me the rolls, she informs me that they are out of avocado. That's basically the main ingredient in the sandwich. I didn't really want much meat, so I agreed to basically a sandwich with some greenery in it.   Spring rolls with just shrimp were very good...although on the small side. The peanut sauce was very tasty as well. When my sandwich came...I noticed that it too was on the small side. Bread was good, just wish I had the full power of the veggie sandwich with all the ingredients.   So basically I left there hungry. Food was cheap tho...I might give them another shot.",

So don't let looks deceive you, this place was pretty good. Probably my second choice for pho in Vegas. First being Pho Saigon 8 on spring mountain. It's called Lemongrass Cafe but it should be appropriately named Lemongrass Diner. A fellow Yelper described it as \"Vietnamese Pulp Fiction\"...my thoughts exactly honey bunny!! Now back to the food. I ordered pho tai, a small bowl as usual. Flavorful broth, not overly salty. I barely had to add any hot sauce to it, didn't need it. Took longer to arrive at my table than I'm used to but I didn't mind so much. 5 minutes isn't a big deal. All in all, pleasantly surprised. Great pho, I'll definitely be back again when I'm on that side of town. Thanks fellow Yelpers for this find. ; )",

    "text": "It's always surprising to find edible Pho places outside of Chinatown, for that I have to give Lemongrass Cafe credit for. This place resides in the former 5 & Dine Cafe and it's pretty interesting how they turned a once upon a time great diner into a Vietnamese cafe. Some of the decor is still leftover from the previous owner plus a touch of Asian decor.   I really enjoyed their Gi Xoai (Green Mango Salad). It was light & refreshing and the tamarind sauce balanced out the flavors wonderfully. This salad consisted of shredded green mango, shrimp, pork, roasted peanuts and fresh herbs. I recommend this salad for those who don't mind the different taste and don't want something too heavy.   Of course you can't have Vietnamese without ordering some pho, spring rolls and eggrolls. I thought both the spring rolls and eggrolls were good. The spring rolls could have used a little more flavor but the sauce made up for what the roll was missing.  I do think it's interesting that they do give you a couple options for different types of spring rolls and eggrolls.  Last but not least, I decided to try the seafood clear noodle soup rather than the pho. I must say, this was the most interesting thing I had ever eaten. Those clear noodles were sticking to the back of my throat that I was trying not to choke on them. I've had these noodles in Korean dishes but for some reason they were really hard to swallow. The best way to describe this feelign is just picture taking a sticky hand and slapping it on the wall. The broth was ok but I probably wouldn't order this dish again.   I would go to this place again to try their pho, banh mi and Kem Xoai Trai Vi (mango ice cream)! Prices were reasonable and for 2 people who were pretty hungry, we paid around $40. Oh before I forget complimentary ice/hot jasmine tea is always a wonderful thing and the staff wasn't too bad. So if you don't want to take a trip to Chinatown, just take a quick trip to Eastern & 215 and you can have the same experience.",

On a cold Vegas day (and there seem to be many of these lately... not complaining, though...I love me some cute boots!!), there is nothing better than pho to warm your belly up. What Lemongrass may have on some of its other competitors (yes, Pho Saigon 8, I'm talking to you!) is that they have both veggie and meat broth options so that the non-meat eaters in the group (MOI, of course!) can also enjoy Vietnam's delish version of clear soup.   While Lemongrass' pho is indeed fantastic (shout out to the veggie-based pho with seafood), another menu star is their chao tom (shrimp and sugar cane rice paper rolls.... SALIVATION time!! The secret ingredient: red shiso. SLURP).   Lunch time here is a bit hectic so, if you go, be prepared to wait a little bit. That said, the wait is absolutely worth it!",

Their Vietnamese egg rolls are hot, crisp, thin, lightly fried in fresh oil, and served with a handful of mint. The mint is used to erase guilt you might feel by eating fried food when the menu offers many other healthy options.   The Vietnamese Crepe fascinates me. We ordered the one with shrimp. It's huge and yellow, like an omelet. It's crispy with lots of holes. See Cayenne's instructions on how to properly eat a Vietnamese Crepe. The hot jasmine tea is complimentary; the sweet, rice flavors set it off.  Lots of my buddies are yelping about the Pho. The Pho's good, but I'm no expert. I only eat brothy soups if I'm trying to lose weight.   I would not order the Lotus Salad again because I didn't like the flavor and smell of the pork. The chicken spring rolls are less fabulous than the egg rolls, so I wouldn't waste stomach space on those either.   Service is fantastic. One of the owners helped me choose delicious menu items our first time in. The decor is an odd mix of framed Asian poster prints, beige booths, purple walls and red neon.   Definitely a new favorite.",

The good news: yes, they have vegan-friendly pho-type soups.  You will not be afraid that they might have accidentally given you meat broth.  The bad news: it tastes like veggie broth, not pho broth. It wasn't spiced in the pho way, to clarify (I already said it doesn't taste like meat!).  No hint of cinnamon, anise, fennel, ginger.  That was disappointing.  The resolution: once I added Sriracha and hoisin and a bunch of lime, it was really tasty.  I very much enjoyed my faux, which had a ton of noodles, nice pieces of lightly fried tofu, and came with nice accoutrements (finely shredded red cabbage, basil, sprouts and hot peppers).  I also tried my friend's lemongrass tofu.  It was very tasty (listed as spicy, but was not spicy spicy.  It was whitepeople spicy at best.)  The veggie soup options are not listed on their dine-in menus, but ARE on the take-out menu, FYI.   The iced tea (just plain iced tea) is really good too, and the servers kept my glass full!  One note: my meatavore friend ordered the bun bo hue', which says pigs feet and blood upon request.  He did not request and still got them, so if you're not into that, double check.  Very reasonably priced, good portion sizes, and very tasty.  Will be back to try the sandwiches soon!",

    "text": "It may be called Lemongrass Cafe but the outside looks like Mel's Diner.    Seemed like a lot of people in the office were craving pho and I mentioned the 10% off via Yelp and that helped seal the deal for lunch.   The clock outside the restaurant said 9:00 but the place was pretty busy at 2 in the afternoon. I like coming here because the staff is always really friendly, and the pho comes out quick before your done wiping down the soup spoon.  I don't like the short wooden chopsticks they give you, but just my only personal pet peeve.    The Bun Bo Hue here is my favorite and the broth consistently has great flavor. *slurp*.  Pho Dac Biet and Bun Thit Nuong get honorable mention also.    Quick and satisfying.  Pho sho!",

We ordered 2 orders of bun bo hue (spicy noodle soup), yes I get it, it's supposed to be spicy.  I can handle the spice, but my fiance cannot, lol ... of course the noodles arrive and as soon as I tasted it I knew he couldn't handle it... The spice level must have been at least an 8! So when the server comes over and asked if it was OK,  I told her it was too spicy for him, and if they  could remake another bowl for him since he only took two bites. Her reply was that we should have told the server how spicy we wanted it. Umm yea obviously I would have, but the server who took the order did not ask. Mind you my fiance is Vietnamese and his mom makes this dish for us all the time, not to mention we've ordered this many times,  many different restaurants and it's never came out this spicy! So long story short,  the server refuses to remake the bowl and tells us we will be charged double, I told her that makes NO SENSE!  But whatever. ... There are way too many restaurants in Vegas to trip over this one restaurant,  so BYE FELICIA!!!!",

Fresh cut Basil stalks and crispy bean sprouts accompanied a huge bowl of delicious noodles and veggies. It was so incredibly good. I've had fun noodle at Whole Foods and was happy, but for the same price I got twice as much noodles and 3 times the veggies. I'm stuffed eating vegetarian and will be back to try the veggie crepes and veggie curry. Great food in a surprising diner building. Glad I discovered this. Makes it easy to eat healthy veggies and feel full. Maybe I'll lose more weight??",

I've driven down Eastern several times in the past few weeks and never would have guessed that 50's diner was a Vietnamese reastuarant plus it's also alittle hidden. If you're not looking for it, you wouldn't even know it's there.Thank you Yelp!  I definitely got my fix on Pho, Bahn Mi and spring rolls. I'm such a piglet, however, I didn't eat everything there. I took the Bahn Mi and srping rolls home for dinner. Yum! And to top that....the place was really clean and the service was excellent. Add to that, the server was the most polite and courteous. She even came back to see how my meal was and as I left she thanked me very much for coming.Could I ask for more? yes....5 minutes from my new home (I just moved here from Seattle last month) and it beats driving into Chinatown.  Thanks for delicious meal Lemongrass Cafe. See you next week!",

I would have never in a million years given this place a try if it wasn't for my fellow yelpers, just from the outside aesthetics, I would have passed it up.  Ordered the spring rolls for starters, and then ordered the shrimp pho, the broth was so perfect, not salty and it had great flavor. All the veggies were fresh, the bowl was large and I'm not ashamed to say I ate/drank the entire thing. What's even better is it was super cheap! I believe our bill was $25 for 2 teas, 2 pho's and an app. Even in 110 degree heat I'm still dreaming of this lunch I had and I can't wait to go back!",

It was really tasty, krispy, and great.  I could not eat meat as it was the last Friday of Lent, so I went with the Shrimp Cheyote.  The waiter looked at me and said \"Spicy?\"  I said yes.  Then I got worried.  I wondered if it would be too much for me to handle. But, when it came out it was great.  It had a good punch of heat, but I like that.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly!  The bf had the one of the beef Pho dishes, though I cannot remember which.  He really like it.  I did try the broth and it was super flavorful.  This is definitely an unexpected treat!  I would go back in a heartbeat.  Though next time, I am getting meat!",

There's something about southern Asian ingredients that I find to be so exciting, fresh and particularly pleasing to my pallet.  When done right there are few people in the nation eating as good as you, and in Las Vegas the Lemongrass Cafe is home to \"done right\" Vietnamese cuisine.    The Pho here is the best I've had in Las Vegas.  The rare steak is so flavorful and tender, the noodles are cooked perfectly, just firm enough to taste and feel the texture of every single noodle. The broth is so clean and refreshing just add sprouts, chili paste and hoisin sauce to taste and dig in. Now lets get to the Bahn Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich) WOW PEOPLE, I possibly couldn't think of a better flavor combination than what the hell is going down in one of these bad boys.  The textures and flavors our out of this world. Crunchy baguette, pickled veggies, nicely seasoned pork, and a little bit of heat. This sandwich brings it home with three out of the five food groups in the Leo flavor spectrum ( Crunchy, Pickled, & Porky )",

Although the decor throws you off a bit as it is a converted 50's diner, the food allows you to look past that.  Yesterday I had the seafood Pho (small) and my husband had the raw meat Pho.  I have to admit my husband is a big fan of this place as well.  My seafood Pho was great...tons of noodles (kinda wished there was more seafood though).  It had crab, fish balls, squid, and shrimp and about 2 of each.  My husband also loved his Pho...he always asks for extra basil on his.  The service was average, our waiter was nice and friendly towards our 4 year old son.  When they first opened they used to give my son a small bowl of noodles with broth; but I guess they don't do that anymore so he had the grilled chicken and steamed rice place which he liked.  The chicken was sliced thin, marinated in a sweet tangy sauce and then grilled.",

I been going here at least once every week until one incident and I stopped. Every time I dine I order the same thing. Older lady I believe ewner recognises me and knows my order. I took a couple of friends highly recommending this restaurant as my favourite. I ordered the same Bun Bo Hue. When the noodles came it was the wrong noodles it was egg noodle instead of the thicker rice noodles. I told the lady sorry these noodles are not the noodles I wanted. She gave me such an attitude saying that's what you ordered I'm not changing it so if you want new noodles I'll charge you. It's not even the noodles or the price at this point. I have been a loyal guest and maybe I made the mistake or she heard wrong but to speak to me in such a way was outright poor customer service. She said you ordered the wrong noodles not my fault. Wow! Is all I'm going to say. No matter how good this restaurant is I will never go back. Service has always been bad water given is slammed on the tables. No smiles not friendly. I go there to try to relax and enjoy the food and friends not to be treated like some homeless person.",

The service has been fast and friendly and if I don't have time to wait a little I can always call ahead for pick up. I love their pho dac biet ( special pho ). The broth is always flavorful, well seasoned, and never greasy. They always provide generous helpings of fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, a wedge of lime and jalepeno even in the to go orders, so I feel like I have the dining portion at home. Winning! I ordered some egg rolls this time around and a side of fresh romaine lettuce, sprigs of mint and fresh dipping sauce came with it. I thought to myself, \"What do I do with all this veggie stuff?\" Then I realized you use the romaine lettuce leaf to wrap around the egg roll so that your hands don't get oily. Brilliant! And if you like, you can add the mint in the lettuce wrap for extra brightness in flavor. The dipping sauce was fish sauce with some chili and lime. It was a perfect compliment to the egg roll lettuce wrap. I didn't notice till later that they cut extra ventilation holes in the to-go box for the freshly made egg rolls so that it wouldn't get soggy. Little details like that says they take pride in their food tasting the way it should be. Fresh and made with love. Highly recommend!",

I ordered #42 Pho Chin Nam (well done brisket and flank) and they packaged everything beautifully for me to take home and assemble at home.  So the meat and all the condiments were packaged separately from the broth, and it was a breeze to put together and reheat a little on the stove top.  Divine flavors from everything!  Today I had lunch with my son, and we ordered three different banh mi sandwiches.  They have several choices of meat.  I had the grilled pork, my son had the pork sausage and also the fried egg.  Excellent! Their prices are inexpensive and all the ingredients are very fresh.  I will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Who would've thought an establishment specializing in Vietnamese cuisine could be actually found inside what appears to be an old school 50s diner?  Glad to have given it a shot as it's become one of my go-to spots in this side of the valley for years.  This restaurant, not only offers dishes on the menu that others don't, but also has food that's far tastier than its competitors.  Too bad that's the only good part left since everything else in this place has certainly gone downhill from my first time dining here.  I have to say, my last visit was rather upsetting.  My group and I were seated by a server who'd rather be doing anything else but her job as we were greeted with a frown and expressed little-to-no concern of how we're doing.  We then decided to move around twice due to this horrid stench coming from each tabletop; must've been that old dish rag used multiple times without being replaced.  I also noticed how the menus are terribly out of date with either marked up prices written all over or random items crossed off.  Overall, Lemongrass is definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in the valley.  However, it's current state left me questioning if it's still even safe to eat here since the place is just dirty.  I know some may attribute this to authenticity as some places in Vietnam where one can get amazing meals aren't in the greatest shape, but this is a different country and everybody in the food industry should be held responsible to a higher level of expectation.  I'd start looking for an alternative if I were you.",

    "text": "I had just got off the plane to sin city and had a hankering for some pho. Nothing fancy, no buffet or big juicy steak, just some pho. I used my yelp app and found this place just a few miles from the airport. While driving there I almost missed it because my gps seemed off ( pointing to the other side of the street). We figured it was on the OTHER side of the street and when going into the shopping center almost missing it because the physical location was in HHS form of Silver Diner. I mean one doesn't expect to see a Vietnamese joint in the form of an old 50's style diner. At least put a guy in a rice hat squatting out front cooking some fish over a some charcoal to make it more obvious.   I'm just kidding about that....he should be squatting and smoking a cigarette.  I was wondering if Alice or Flo were gonna take our order and then we'd see Mel throw a couple of bowls of pho in the kitchen window and (DING!) yell \"PICKUP!\". If you didn't get that reference you're too dam young or you didn't grow up here.  Moving on. The inside does have the look and feel of an old diner. It almost feels like its a double wide trailer. I like it. We were seated right away at a table by the window with  comfy chairs. They have a big menu. With lots of choices. Noodle(vermicelli) dishes with BBQ pork, chicken or cat. Just kidding, dog. Haha! Beef dammit. There's something about the way Vietnamese prepare their meat, it tastes fresh, sweet and has that nice char.  A good selection of appetizers like spring rolls ( made with rice paper and not fried), but also some fried rolls. They had some banh mi, those sanwhiches on a baguette with pork, cilantro, pickled carrots and radish. Plenty of rices dishes, if you didn't care for noodles.  And of course, what I came for, pho. Which I ordered with rare beef flank, tendons and tripe. That's right, give me that pink and nasty gushy stuff. I also ordered some homemade pork sausage spring rolls. Which were pretty frickin awesome. The sausage was grilled so it had a crispy outside and then thinly sliced. There was an element that I never had in a fresh spring roll as well, they put a stick of fried won ton wrapper inside, that gave it that extra crunch when biting into it. It was like eating a fried roll....but not. I washed that down with a glass of freshly squeezed limeade. Served in a tall fountain glass with extra long spoon.   Then they brought the pho out. (I like how they waited for us to finish the appetizer first). The broth was good, but I needed to add some chilli sauce for that extra kick. Threw in the fresh basil off the twig, sprouts and jalepenos and BOOM I was very satisfied. After slurping on it like I was eating some late night macaroni and cheese, I reached the bottom of the bowl. All done. Take my money I'm out.   The service was good and I feel like they had some kind of edge serving out of that diner.",

Im not a huge consumer of pho, but the broth here is pretty tasty.   I order a 39, i believe which is the rare meat, and it was very tender. We ordered a combination bah mi sandwich,  150, homemade sausage, an order of spring rolls...and a few other bowls of non pho.   The older couple that seems to be the owners were very kind. Never had to hunt anyone down for water, or forks or anything like that.   I dont understand  why they only seat in one part of the restaurant. ..and i do agree  that the tables filled with mail, paper and god only  knows what is a little off putting.",

We ordered the Beef Pho, Nem Nuong Spring Rolls, Banh Xeo and Beef Fried Rice. All were below average, I would not eat here again ever! I'd rather take the extra time to drive to Chinatown for better food and better prices. The Beef Pho was barely warm, the broth tasted sour and the meat was clearly frozen. The Nem Nuong Spring Rolls were sad and disgusting, I mean, the meat looked like it was from years ago, the coloring was way off and it did not taste or look right. The Banh Xeo was a joke, it came out looking greasy and it had a weird sour taste to it. The only thing that was kind of average was the beef fried rice and that was it, only because it's rice! The beef was ok as it had flavor and was a little tender. This is not the right standard for Vietnamese food and I don't trust that their food is fresh. Never Again!",

    "text": "I have experienced the deliciousness of Lemongrass Cafe many times and I never  walk away disappointed. Although it's located inside a 50's diner, that should not deter you from enjoying the incredible food. The smell of the food being cooked when you first walk in, is enough to convince you that this place does it right.  I first heard about Lemongrass in a review in the Las Vegas Weekly magazine and instantly wanted to try it. Ever since my trip to Germany last year, I've wanted to find a place here that has amazing Pho. What is funny is that out of the many times I have eaten at Lemongrass, I have only had their Pho once. It's not to say that their Pho isn't good, it's I have found their Bun Cha Gio Chay to be absolutely amazing. This dish is my dish whenever I come here, which can be a bad thing since I so torn between it and trying something new. They must put something amazing in those vegetarian eggrolls because you will be wanting more just after one bite.   Their menu is quite extensive and I sure even the pickiest eater can find something to eat. Whether you are a carnivore to vegetarian there is something for everyone here. One other wonderful thing about Lemongrass is the complimentary hot or iced Jasmine tea. Although most might not enjoy the unsweetened taste of jasmine tea, I always order this to go along with food. Very few restaurants offer tea for free so this automatic gold stars in my book.  Food:   Bun Cha Gio Chay is a rice vermicelli noodle dish with shredded lettuce, basil, cucumber, bean sprouts, peanuts, and a garlic sauce with shredded carrots. You can order this dish any number of ways with or without meat as well as with or without eggrolls. I always order the one with the vegetarian eggrolls and you would never know that this is absolutely no meat in these. It is a simple dish that was a little deceptive at first. My very first bite I thought it was just ok but as you continue to eat it gets better and better until you are hooked.  Pho Ga is their chicken pho and this dish I have only tried as take out. The broth was fragrant and not heavy at all. When adding the sides of bean sprouts, lime, basil, jalapenos, and other herbs, it all balanced well with the beef broth. They do not skimp on the added condiments of the soup(had enough left over it actual make a dish but had no clue as to what to make), but as far as the chicken I was a little disappointed on the amount given. The Pho was wonderful and I will definitely order it when I am not taking it as take out.   Vegetarian Eggrolls are magical! This was a side order to the Pho as take out and they were no different than if I was sitting in the restaurant. These fried, crispy   pieces of goodness are filled with tofu, clear noodles, taro, jicama, carrot, white onion, black mushrooms, and served with garlic soy sauce. I have to have these every time I go to Lemongrass. They are a must and are the best eggrolls I have ever had.",

Something about this place rubs me the wrong way, don't get me the wrong the 60s diner feel is kinda funky, actually kind a cool. What bothers me about this place the most is the constant foul smell of sewage coming from god knows where (I'm guessing the kitchen). This has been the third time that the whole dining area has a strong smell of garbage.   Today was the icing on the cake. I went here with some coworkers for lunch, upon ordering the server gave my two Asian friends chopsticks and my friend and I forks...seriously?! I think I just got racially profiled. :/ It is a pet peeve of mine when servers give non-Asians (btw, I'm happa) forks in a Asian restaurant. You can see why it hit a little close to home for me.   The food is meh, the service is nothing to write home about. You are better off going across the street to Saigon 8 any day.   I just don't get it...",

It was a cute diner and setting but definitely weird because I had eaten at the old place before it become lemongrass. But I was definitely satisfied with the layout.  My soup was just okay. I think what made it good was the tons if sauce I had to put in it. The main thing I was unsatisfied with was the service. We were greeted very rudely and never got checked up on. The restaurant only had maybe a couple more people in it and we had to wave down a waitress two times before finally getting refills.  Another thing I want to add was that my boyfriends dish tasted like shrimp when it was definitely a chicken dish. It was just very not appeasing to know that the same pans are used to cook different meats.  And the last thing that bothered me was a homeless women walked straight in to the restaurant and went to each table asking for money. I feel like the owners did nothing to stop this and I was just unhappy with my service overall. I don't think I'd go back here anytime soon. Next time I'll have to go down to Chinatown.",

But I'm glad Lemongrass proved me wrong. They serve a number of delicious dishes. With over 100 items on the menu, here are a few of my favorite items on the menu:  -the Vietnamese coffee: a perfect blend of bitter and sweet. Once it's finished filtering into a cup with condensed milk, pour it over ice and enjoy. -Vermicelli with lemongrass beef and egg rolls: I love the combination of noodles, beef and crunchy egg rolls. Of course, you can't forget the flavorful fish sauce to pour over the bowl and/or dip your egg rolls. -the combination fried rice  Surprisingly, I don't usually get pho. As much as I've been here, I've probably ordered pho 10% of the time. This isn't any indication of their pho (it's actually pretty good), but instead it just shows how much I enjoy the other items on the menu. The owner is great, always friendly and accommodating. So don't let the diner exterior fool you. This place has the goods to satisfy your Vietnamese cravings",

Staff was somewhat rude and unwelcoming. Never coming back. Pho Saigon by LVAC from now on.",

One of my favorite soups is their Bun Bo Hue / Spicy Beef Soup Hue-style.  If you like it red hot and flavorful, this is the bowl to challenge.  It always made me sweat. However, one of my all times favorite Vietnamese dishes is Bo Nhung Dam / Beef with Vinegar Broth.  It's rarely served in most Vietnamese restaurants and I used to always go with my family to share that dish.  Upon my last visit in June, they no longer served the original dipping sauce for that dish.  Big faux pas.  My disappointment brought on disgraceful service from the staff, so I don't think I'm welcome there anymore, lol.",

The pho exceeded our expectations and the lemongrass chili tofu was possibly one of the best Vietnamese dishes I've ever eaten.  Go there immediately!

Definitely not their strong suit. Servers are rushed, sort of pushy, the place seems to be run in a bit of a chaotic fashion. I ordered an iced tea. Never got it. Fine.  The food is pretty decent. It will definitely hit your Vietnamese craving, but it is not going to blow you out of the water. Bun was ok and a decent size, but lacking in flavor. Pho was a nice portion and had good flavor, but the veggie side could have been bigger and some of the meat was a bit questionable.   Overall a passable place that will suit a craving, but not amazing. Negative points for weird service and an even stranger ambiance in an old 50's diner.",

At first, we thought it was an oversight, but as weekly customers, we see this shorting every visit. We shouldn't have to ask for a full bowl every visit.  The menus are terribly out of date with many items crossed off or new prices penned in.  And the restaurant is just...dirty. There are stains and fingerprint everywhere, and the outside desperately needs basic landscaping maintenance.   This restaurant earned \"Best of Vegas\" in the past, but given the trend they're following, I think their days are numbered. Start looking for a new place for your pho fix.",

It is light and tasty with great textures of noodles, veggies, meat and crispy egg rolls. The wifey got her typical veggie pho and loved it. We also ordered their veggie spring rolls. It was fresh and delicious. The Vietnamese iced coffee was too sweet. The whipped cream on top was regrettable. Great prices and service. A solid 4 stars.",

It's a good change of atmosphere since most Pho places are expected to kind of have the same look and feel all the time.  I do love love love their pho broth here. Something about it just has so much flavor in it! While I do have the tendency to get horrible service at most pho places, this place kind of went up and beyond. So up and beyond, that the service was a little too into my personal space. Our server did very little with the small talk, and did on the positive side check on our table often, but when he did come to our table to drop of our food he did take it upon himself to move my clutch purse himself to across the table. He also took the liberty of moving my soup spoon from one plate to the plate that I was eating in as I was eating. So I felt a little uncomfortable because it reminded me of my grandmother when she'd be all up in my personal space while I eat. Smothering me. Protecting me. Choking me. Oh..childhood flashbacks...  They give you a good amount of the helpings and meat in your pho for a really good price. I think pho prices run about $7.00 to $9.00. 'd also suggest to try their Vietnamese ice coffee too! It's super delish and full of flavor.",

Even the tables are arranged in a diner style. Super adorable.  When we went it there, it was dead empty. I guess we went in after lunch time. I was a bit skeptical about it but we were too hungry to care. We ordered pork sandwich, pho, and their lemongrass chicken with rice.   Sandwich :  bf says it used to be bigger. The taste was really good regardless. The bread was crunchy and soft, the relishes were tasty too. Nothing to complain there.  Pho: I mean...it's pho, it's alwaysdelicious. It wasn't like OH. MY. GOSH. SO GOOD, but it was good enough. Rare beef wasn't really pinky rare tho for my taste.  Lemongrass Chicken : HOT DAMN that thing is amazing. I loved the seasoning and spices of it. I can actually taste the freshly cooked lemongrass. Although I live no where near Las Vegas, next time I visit, I would go back for them chickenss.  How was the service?  it was satisfying. :D",

    "text": "One of the few Vietnamese restaurants I have come across in Vegas and I have to say it is decent enough for me to come back multiple times. I was thinking about giving this place 4 stars, but I have been spoiled with cheaper and tastier Vietnamese dishes back in Orange County.  My favorite dish would have to be the lemongrass beef rice plate with the egg cake and shredded pork that comes with rice and vegetables. Don't get the lemongrass beef dish that only comes with the meat and veggies because it is the same price, but you don't get a variety of items. I tried both and you don't get much more beef so just be aware of that. A few things I didn't like was the lack of pickled carrots and daikon that normally come with broken rice dishes and the weak tasting fish sauce. I literally had to use the whole bowl they gave to me to flavor my rice and it still wasn't enough. If you don't like fish sauce, then it shouldn't be a problem haha.  You can expect typical Asian service which means the workers don't have the best customer service. I was literally seated and handed a menu and the guy comes over less than a minute later asking me if I was ready to order when I was clearly still checking the stuff out. Then he never came back to check on my friend and I so I had to go to the front and ask for service. They don't really check up on you if you need a refill on your drink or when you are ready to pay the bill. If normally let these things slide since the food usually makes up for it. In this case however, I am desperate for Vietnamese food so I guess I'll lee coming back until I find a better place.  Oh yeah, don't get confused by the place if you are going to try it out for the first time. It literally looks like an American diner from the 60's. They should probably change it up a bit unless that's the look they are going for...",

This place used to be a '50s diner, so the ambience doesn't quite match the venue...All the more reason to check this place out! You will definitely be happy with this place. I drive across town just to go here, and it's always worth it. Now that it's soup season, my family and i will be frequenting Lemongrass even more.",

I ordered an additional item as I was waiting for my food to be prepared and because I didn't have cash and the additional order came to about $4.00, she decided she would not process the order. The reason why they only take cash unless it's over $10.00 is due to merchant fees. It's simply the cost of doing business. There are tons of better restaurants than this one. I will not be back here again. Mind you, I was the ONLY customer there. Very disappointed.",

But the reason I'm not going to give 5 or even 4 stars is because they make the same mistake every single time. I literally ask for my mae go ren noodles with no meat, and no extra veggies. Just what it comes with on the menu itself which is (egg, tofu, potatoes, and I think asparagus). EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. they either don't add egg, forget potatoes or usually add a bunch of veggies that I don't want. Is it that hard to just make it with the simple ingredients listed on the menu. This wasn't once, not twice. Its every time. usually they end up remaking it for me. You might wonder why I go back.. it's because when the noodles are right they are some of the best noodles I've had. The sweet and sour chicken is incredible and Thai tea as well. However, not sure if its the server or the kitchen.. but just learn to listen to the guest and follow simple direction/requests.",

I rate the food 4 1/2 to 5 stars. The pricing is good and the quality of the food is good. Their broth is really good and tasty and their fried rice is just amazing! Just for fried rice- amazing!! Also the exterior and interior looks like a diner! Doesn't look a pho place at all :) it looks different!   I take customer service into consideration and it's very important when rating the restaurant thoroughly. However, if there is lack of good customer service when the food is absolutely outstanding along with the price, I MIGHT disregard the bad customer service.   In this case, I've been going here for a long time and before they had staff that are now gone. The staff before were nice and polite. I would say the staff here is lousy and not attentive to the customers. They could improve by greeting the customer with a smile and not seem upset to be working when talking to the customers. There have been a few times when they didn't check up on us and it took a while for the waters to get to our table. Most of the time we have to go up to their front desk ourselves if we needed something.   Other than a 3 rating for their customer service, they have really good food for a decent price and the ambience makes it relaxing and chill to have lunch or dinner.",

I browsed the menu while boyfriend was in the bathroom washing his hands. I decided to browse and maybe try a noodle bowl with grilled meat but they wouldn't let me substitute beef for pork instead of pork with pork sausage. I went for my usual pho tai. Nothing outstanding about this pho. Meat was tender and the portion was standard. I remember the pho tasting better. As for service it's been so long I can't tell but the server here was absolutely rude. I wouldn't return. It's sad there's less than a handful of pho places on this side of town and most of them have hit or miss service and subpar pho.",

We were hoping for a 45 minute dinner at 7 to make a movie at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night. We didn't make the originally planned movie. It was our fault for not planning enough cushion. The restaurant is understaffed to handle dinner rushes on the weekend and everything was just backed up. The staff was not standing around twiddling their thumbs. In fact, they were working quite hard and they did well to get us in and out in an hour. But we only got two bowls of soup. They had two servers to cover about 20+ tables and to host. There was one food runner and one busser. 5 minute wait to get seated, 5 minute wait for greet, 35 minute ticket time. They just couldn't handle the volume. We did make it to another movie at 8:15 in the Colannade.  I would recommend for the pho. Unless you have no time constraints for your meal, I would not recommend going during peak meal times.",

This place has a very interesting theme. Like all the other reviewers mentioned, this place looks like a diner straight out of the 70's. The first time I went there, I had Vermicelli with Chicken and my friend had rare beef Pho and we had shrimp&pork spring rolls for appetizers. The spring rolls were okay, one unique thing about their spring rolls is that they have some kind of crispy chips? in them. Vermicelli with chicken was not bad, but nothing special. What I like about their Pho is that the portion is huge, but I thought it should be a bit hotter when it's served. Pho So 1 or Pho Kim Long serve their Pho super hot, but Lemongrass Cafe is just hot, going towards warm.   Second time arounds we had the same appetizers, well-done flank Pho, and Shrimp stir fry noodle. Again, I don't know why, but Pho was almost just warm! Maybe I should let them know to make it super hot when I order. Also, the noodles were a bit overcooked this time. Shrimp stir fry noodle wasn't that good. It had a very good flavor, but the noodles were a bit too sticky.  All the staffs are very nice and friendly. I didn't have any problem with their service. I think I'm going to give this place one more shot and decide whether or not to become a regular.",

Maybe a few months passed and they changed the recipe.  Maybe I was just really hungry.  Whatever the reason is all I know is that was some of the best pho tai I've had in a very long time.  The service has also improved quite a bit.  They have good from friendly to extremely friendly and attentive.  I'm not going to act like I am a pho expert and that my knowledge of pho is more than everyone else, but I've had my fair share of bowls across Cali and Vegas.  This last one had some of the best both I've had in a while.  A lot of places that I've eaten out here at seem watery, the basil isn't fresh, or i'm thinking \"where's the beef\" (showing my age there).  This one has it all working for it.  I cleared the large bowl, had some egg rolls, and mango ice cream.  The large bowl is large... I just have a healthy appetite.  So much so that the waitress asked if I worked out all the time because she didn't see where all the food was going.   Most of all, this place made me home sick.   Awww... Westminster and your tasty eateries I miss you.  Lol!",

    "text": "While in Vegas last week, I got a sudden urge for some Banh Mi and Chicken Pho and of course, almighty Yelp led us to Lemongrass Cafe.  Yeah, yeah, the outside looks like a 50's diner, actually now that I think of it, it kind of resembled an oversized Streamline trailer.  But hey, who cares, you're there for the food, not to play Architectural Digest trivia.  Their menu was quite extensive as it had your basic Vietnamese and Thai offerings along with, Banh Mi...yay!  Talk about a perfect trifecta of Asian food!  So, I order my Chicken Pho and I shared the Combo Banh Mi with the s/o.  Pricing was a little bit on the high side compared to the Bay Area, my Pho was pushing $7 and the Banh Mi was $3.75.  Our Banh Mi took awhile to make, not sure why but when it came out, I was slightly disappointed.  It's thickness was mostly the bread's doing but it was also short but oh well.  I took a bite into it and the sandwich redeemed itself, it was quite delicious for such a small thing.  The bread was tasty, not sure if they bake it on site but it sure tasted like they did.  But, still disappointed about how small it was.  When it comes to Banh Mi, size certainly matters, the longer the better, right? ;)  My Chicken Pho was good, pretty basic, can't really mess it up.  However, my bowl had a lot of chicken.  Usually, my general complaint on most food I eat is how skimpy the meat is, well, not my bowl of Chicken Pho, it was loaded!  The staff was really friendly.  This one girl who was our server, whoa, talk about stewardess in the making!  She exerted such overwhelming friendliness, courtesy and hospitality.  Overall, Lemongrass Cafe was a decent place to eat and worth going to get your Viet/Thai/Banh Mi fix on!",

I get even more excited when the tofu is prepared and flavored well.   Finding this place must be fate because my craving for some vermicelli noodle dishes pushed me to pursue my quest for the \"perfect\" Vietnamese dishes. I'm glad I listened to my gut because this place definitely satisfied my cravings.   My Fiance and I order for take out. Here are the items we ordered-- 1.) Shrimp and Pork spring rolls: Nothing out of the ordinary. Packed really dense, looks small. Peanut sauce tastes the same as other places.   2.) Rare steak and meatball pho: my fiance likes it, but the broth slightly lacked flavor and there wasn't as much meat as he wanted or has had from other restaurants.   3.) Tofu Vermicelli: YUM! The carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, peanuts, mint and noodles were very well balanced. I like having more vegetables in my vermicelli dishes so this definitely caught my eye. And the sauce that accompanied it, so light and not overwhelmingly fishy tasting. My only complaint was the tofu was somewhat more oily than I am accustomed; However, the mouthwatering, lemongrass flavor of it outweighed it's oilyness. :P   And thank goodness this place is close to where I live. Lemongrass Cafe gives me even more reason not to move too far away from the southeast.",

I had the chicken pho, add a bit of hots and was good to go.   We also had 2 apps, the veggie spring rolls and the chicken satay. The satay was a bit over done, but the owner popped by the table to tell us that and that she would take that off of the bill without us even saying anything.   I will be dining here again!",

I dragged the husband to this place (we drove around for about 20 mins cos my GPS was taking me to weird places) and finally come to it. It's a Vietnamese place that is in one of those old school diner structures. Intrigued? Yes I was. I galloped into the restaurant.   Service was good. The waitress was very sweet and made recommendations for us. We had the following  Vietnamese Crepe (Vegetarian) - This is probably why I'm giving the place 3 stars and not 2. Tasted amazing and was HUGE. Note to self: Vietnamese Crepes are only starters when there are 5 people at the table. The expectations grew higher after the stellar crepe  Veggie Pho with Tofu and Veggies - Have to give it to them. Portion sizes are generous. The Pho was not flavorful. It was like vegetable stock. Quite disappointing. I could microwave something in 2 minutes that could have tasted similar  Lemongrass Tofu - Eh.....I've had better. The tofu by itself was quite overpowering and had a pretty weird smell but with the rice, I was able to eat a few bites.   They did honor the 10% discount on the menu when I mentioned \"Yelp.\" The total bill with the discount was around $30.   I'll probably not be back. I think the Pho at Veggie Delight tastes superior.",

Ok, no. Then I got a Vietnamese pork sandwich.  The only thing in there was some kind of lunch meat looking thing, shredded carrots (mind you, it wasn't even pickled), and sliced cucumbers. No cilantro. No taste. Nothing special about the Thai tea.. Last, the guy who rang up the bill handed me a paper with numbers and my total and said, \" is everything right here?\" Umm how would I know what those numbers mean? Won't be coming back if I'm ever craving pho. Sorry not sorry.",

My gripe about Lemongrass Cafe is the service. It's been pretty iffy all the times that I've come here and that's for both dine in AND take out. For dining in, it took way too long for someone to come up to us, greet and seat us then even longer to get water and have our orders taken. For take out, I had called in my order and came a little later than what the host had told me it would take. And then waited another 10 minutes on top of that..

    "text": "Vegas.  My home away from home for the past 5 6 years.  Food is good in general on the vegas strip and pricey but I wouldn't quite categorize it as great for what you pay.  As I would always say, the nice fancy restaurants always dish out \"technically\" good food.  I mean, how many ways can you really make sushi or cook a piece of nice steak.  6 ways I guess... Rare, black n blue, medium rare, medium, medium well, n well done.... Done \"technically\" well, plate it nicely, and BOOM price marked up the ying yang.  Too much eating on the strip does sometimes make \"charming\" food lose its magic.  You can call it boring to be precise.  That's why I'm always looking for food away from the strip especially during the lunch hours.  After a long hard fought night through the clubs n drinks n the masses, it's always a pleasant feeling to sit down to a nice bowl of pho.  In this case, it was a Bun Bo Hue; a traditional spicy beef and pork noodle soup with the fragrant aroma of lemongrass and shrimp paste along with other herbs that originated from central Vietnam.  It's really hard to find a great BBH but when you do find one, you can guarantee to be loyal.  It's like having a GF or a wife.  Why would you look elsewhere when you already have the best?  For BBH though, if it's above average, I suggest you stick with it and stop looking around because you'll be disappointed when you finally realize that even an above average one is harder to come by than a SF home with A/C.  The one I had today was a keeper.  I normally would play it safe n just pick up a Pho Dac Biet aka combination beef pho aka  at any pho restaurant while itching to satisfy my curiosity of the BBH if available.  Saw it on the menu so I just had to ask... He said he'd order the BBH over the PDB.  I was sold.    I subbed the usual thicker denser chewier rice noodle for the pho noodle.  It was a good choice.  Very aromatic and flavorful.  Soup came out very hot which any noodle soup lover would surely know to appreciate.  It came with fancy pork, cuts of beef w tendon, and pork skin n collagen that were nice n tender.  I wish they had the cubes of pig's blood though.  Overall, it was a good BBH experience which is nice since it's just a few mins down from where I stay out here.  It's located in an old vintage american diner setting that you can't miss.  Service feels slow here but you'll be satisfied.  And if you are still battling a hangover, be sure to hydrate and restore your electrolytes with some young coconut juice.  You'll feel alive when you walk out of there.",

    "text": "So far this has been the best Vietnamese food outside of China town. Most places in Vegas are terrible. We've tried maybe a dozen of them and have not left satisfied. Portions and taste was good. Ordered the Com Bi Suong Cha and Bun Thit Nuong Nam and Chai Gio. Rice plate and cold noodles. For the appetizer we had Nam Nuong spring rolls. We liked the spring roll as the pork patty is home made. Not the store bought kind. Peanut sauce is legit. For the rice and vermicelli plates the meat are seasoned well with a hint of lemongrass which most places lack to be authentic. Their fish sauce is also good. As any Vietnamese person would know if the sauce is terrible your dish will be terrible. -1 Star was due to service. Food took 25 mins to come out on a very slow day. 2 parties came after us by 5 mins or so got their food first and they didn't order noodles. Everything was made to order which is nice. Meats are not partially cooked and re heated on the grill. All in all good food in a dive location. 50's diner ambiance.",

    "text": "I'm a shameless regular at Lemongrass Cafe. Although business has increased steadily since I first started coming here, the quality of service and food has not declined, which is PHENOMENAL. It might even be safe to say that the staff and food here have gotten even better with 'age'!  Now on to the pho...  The pho. Oh my god, the pho. It hits the spot. And when I say the spot--I mean THE spot. Amazing with a hangover, even better sober. It's better than sex, and I can say my mind's been blown once or twice so I know what I'm talking about.  Lemongrass Cafe is BETTER THAN SEX. When you're full, you wish you weren't cuz the food is so goddamn good. You just can't get enough.  I've had pho in different parts of the USA including Hawaii, and Lemongrass Cafe has the BEST pho I've had EVER. The broth is savory and delicious--it doesn't need any addtional condiment although you could add whatever you want obviously. It's flavorful and fresh... I get all hot just thinking about it.  Now the staff. The people taking your order and refilling your water and fulfilling your every need. They are wonderful, beautiful humans and you will love them. Every single one of them. They're always smiling, and their smiles are genuine--they don't fake it and that makes the climax of this experience indescribable.  Now the food might take a little longer than other pho spots to come but it's because it's FRESH, people. It's worth the wait. This restaurant is about QUALITY, and you get more than you pay for. If I'm not mistaken, Lemongrass Cafe is more affordable than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The fresh spring (?) rolls are Amazing, and the peanut sauce that goes along with it is orgasmic. I rarely use that word cuz I rarely orgasm, so believe me when I say it'll make your eyes roll back.   In fact, everything I've had here is delicious!! Even their iced coffee!  Overall, Lemongrass Cafe is the best. And trust me, I'll have nothing but THE BEST.",

I love that I can get my vegetable pho with more vegetables instead of tofu, too. They have a $10 minimum for credit cards, so watch out for that, but I recommend this place to anyone looking for some yummy Vietnamese food.",

    "text": "I've seen this little stainless steel diner cart a few times since we've moved to Vegas and had always wondered what it was. Well, today I finally found out when the hubby and I decided to try it.  I have never had Vietnamese food in my life, so I was a bit apprehensive, but I love trying new things. It looked exactly how you would think a Vietnamese restaurant in a diner cart would look and I absolutely loved it! We started off with the tofu spring rolls that came with peanut sauce and they were delicious. They had a nice crunch to them and the tofu was cooked perfectly.   Hubby ordered the Vegetarian Pho and it was fantastic! Beautiful-looking and tasty, the broth was very flavourful, and tons of crunchy veggies with rice noodles that were not overcooked like they can normally be. I ordered the Vermicelli with Tofu. Once again, the tofu was cooked perfectly and had very good flavour! The vermicelli were very well cooked too and I loved the Thai basil in this dish especially.   All in all, a very good experience! Our waitress was very attentive without going overboard with it and she was extremely polite. Very comfortable atmosphere and will be recommending this little gem to others.",

You could taste the beef bones used to make the broth. It was rich with beef flavor and had a little fatty richness to it.   If ur not that risky and want a safe dish. You could order #80 which is an excellent tender beef dish with onions and bell peppers.   The wait staff during lunches are really helpful and informative. The male&female staff work the floor and seem to know all the patrons on a first name basis.   I was impressed when the female server asked me if I wanted my grilled chicken spring roll. I met her only once before (3 weeks earlier) and asked if there wS an alternative to the shrimp and pork option.   I wS impressed when she mentioned it was too hot to eat soup and asked if I'd still be ordering soup . Which is what I ordered once before.  \"she's good\"  I thought for a moment wow I'm that memorable, \"pause for reflection\" nope she's just that good.. Lol..   I will come here again just to order something different to throw her off. Hehehe.",

I've made pho before and basically all you do is boil noodles and add slices of beef and the broth that was pre-made in a larger pot, but it took my boyfriend and I at least 20 minutes to get our food. We saw bowls coming out and none of them were ours... We thought they may have forgotten about us haha.   I have to say though, the broth is much more flavorful compared to other pho restaurants here in vegas. However, the bottom of my boyfriends bowl had remnants of dried food... Not the best at washing dishes.   But since my boyfriend was starving and it was only dirty on the outside, he ate it anyway haha. Still... It wasn't appetizing knowing that he was eating out of a bowl that was dirty on the outside and was filled with a dark soup base not being able to see what was inside.",

Service was horrid (half an hour before we got asked for our drink orders), but that isn't the dominant reason for the low rating.  The broth was just salty with little actual flavor.  Portions were small and the price was much higher than that of REAL Viet places.  I can certainly see the draw of this place --it's close to Green Valley and suburbs of Las Vegas. Go here if you must, but if you've been to the Little Saigons, the Little Vietnams, or a Vietnamese grandma's kitchen, you'll leave unsatisfied.  Go to Pho So 1 on Decatur and Spring Mountain -- little grimier, but loads better.",

We're not locals and coming from Los Angeles we know all of our PHO spots.  So who do we turn to, our handy dany yelp.  so this place pretty much was the first to pop up, read reviews, and said why not.  So we pull up and it looks like a 50's diner which was pretty off for being a PHO place, but don't let the looks decieve you.  We enter, we sit down look at the menu and ordered our soup.  Although most of the PHO places i've gone to is really quick and fast it took kind of long to get our soups, i won't lie i was getting frustrated already.  i would say it was a good 20mins wait, for PHO i know right.  well anyways we holler at the waitress to ask what's up with our soup and she said they were waiting for our egg rolls to cook, so i think okay they just want all of our stuff we ordered to come out at the same time.  So food comes, and wow!! The broth was super good! It was very rich in flavor, it was really good, i really enjoyed it.  So this frustrated person became a happy person.  We are for sure coming back to get our PHO fix and i would totally recommend this place.",

    "text": "The family was hungry and craving Pho today, so we headed to Lemongrass Cafe. When we first walked in we were hit with that familiar delicious aroma. As we stepped in towards the dining area, though, we ran into sewer smell. We hesitated, sniffing, and the owner noticed. She gave an apologetic smile and nodded that yes, there was a problem. We know back-ups can happen and it wasn't overpowering, so we opted to stay.  The food was spot on delicious. 5 star for sure. The waitress was cold, but stiffly polite. A couple things we asked for didn't come, but we rolled with it and chalked it up to language barrier...no big deal. We raved about the iced tea. It was very good, mild with a subtle hint of vanilla. When it was time to go, my daughters asked if they could have to-go cups for their tea (we had demolished all our food) and were each given one.  While waiting for the chech and credit card to come back I decided I wanted to take my unfinished tea with me as well. I asked for a cup. None ever came. We were ready to leave and I asked again...thinking she hadn't heard me. The owner told me that they normally charge for cups because the tea (which is not gratis) is to be drunk in the restaurant. She further informed me that she had to buy said cups, completely de-bunking the assumption I had when I fell off of the turnip truck, that they arrived free from the cup fairy. I asked how much, she said 25, and I gave her the last dollar my family will ever spend there.  These are tough times, and we all work too hard for our money to spend it somewhere that obviously does not want our business. We've been repeat customers because of the food, putting up with surly servers, but today was it. Our final order, and it was delicious: Banh Xeo Chay / Vegetarian Crepe 7.95  Goi Sen / Lotus Salad 8.95 Pho Tai / Rare Beef Pho - Small 6.95 Pho Bo Vien / Beef Meatball Pho - Small 6.95  Banh Mi (we got the Vietnamese sausage one, but i can't find it on the online menu)$3.95 I think... 4 ice teas (reg, not Thai) @ $1.50 ea plus tax and 20% tip came to about $53 bucks or so... not bad for lunch for 4.  Anybody have a Pho place to recommend? Pho Mailan (sp) is where we thought we'd try next.",

You know... the ones where the tables are sticky, you have to use a napkin to wipe all the chopsticks and tea cups, where the service sucks, the waiters look like they would mug you in a dark alley, and they stick their thumb when carrying the giant delicious bowl of goodness. Who cares about these minor deficiencies if the food is good, right?!?!  Well lemongrass gets pretty dang close to that quality, while being an extremely CLEAN and CIVILIZED restaurant. The pho was off the hook. A bit smaller than the hole-in-the-wall places, and the meat was leaner. Price was a bit higher too. But I guess I can pay the extra dollar so the waiter doesn't dip his thumb in my soup.",

Broth was almost tasteless and what you could taste was too sweet.  Noodles were clumped together, and the menu is just too big to have anything of real quality in my opinion.  I understand that most were the same with small variations, if that's the case have the variations as toppings.  Condense something. Atmosphere is really weird, as this used to be a diner, and the seating is pretty cramped. I can't recommend this place, but again, my experience with vietnamese food is limited.

    "text": "My favorite Vietnamese restaurant on my side of town! At some point this place changed business owners and there were some inconsistencies such as a noticeable change in their pho broth, hence the lower rating.   - Spring Rolls: Love their version! They add a crunchy element in the middle and it is yummy! Add sriracha to the peanut sauce for an extra kick.  - Pho: I used to really like their pho broth.  It is not as flavorful anymore.  The pho tai (rare beef), seafood, and vegetarian pho are all good.   - Vermicelli bowls:  Flavor bomb and great noodles. Their noodles are thin and soft, while other places have hard, thicker noodles.  My go to is the charbroiled pork with egg rolls.  I highly recommend the beef lemongrass vermicelli bowl if you're not afraid of flavor!  The sweet, vinegar, fish sauce that comes with the bowls is yummy...pour it all in the bowl and mix everything up. I love the freshness of the veggies and all the different textures going on.  - Beef crispy egg noodles: I really like this dish, but they are a bit stingy with the \"gravy.\"  I like the center to be slightly softened by the brown sauce, with outer edges still crunchy.  They tend to serve this dish with not enough sauce, with a center that is still very crunchy.  Service isn't the best, but food usually comes out in a timely manner.  Pay for your meal at the counter after you're done eating.",

    "text": "Gosh if there was ever a 0 star rating on YELP it would definitely be for this place. I've been a regular here with my roommate for a few weeks now and last night we walked in to an empty restaurant with no patrons. I've been suffering from a cold the past few days and thought a nice bowl of hot soup would do me some good. I sat in my usual booth but the ceiling fans were turned on full blast so I asked if we could move to another booth which is reasonable especially if you have allergies and a cold.   Here's what really shocked me besides the soggy noodles and rancid tasting wontons: The male cook in the back. He was loud and boisterous and spoke Vietnamese clearly within range of an earshot and talks very badly about customers that dine here. After the lady took my order, he proceeded to talk about me and my roommate bashing us and saying we are bad customers. He also said a bunch of nasty things that were very shocking. He called us lousy customers cause one time my roommate asked for extra napkins and also extra veggies with our chicken pho which we happily paid for.   I can't believe how rude this chef was. The thing is, I speak fluent Vietnamese and understood everything he was saying. He probably thought I did not understand or speak his language but regardless here's the deal: If you work in the restaurant industry and bash your regular customers by talking smack about them while they are dining in your restaurant, you have no business working in this field. I was very shocked, we could barely finish our meal and needless to say we will never support this restaurant again. There are much better places in the area especially the Pho place down the street by LVAC that will treat you will kindness and respect. From the lack of customers this place definitely is on it's way downhill. They definitely lost a loyal customer for life.  If you ask for anything extra or order extra sides, just know this CHEF will talk badly behind you back or perhaps even spit in your food. ( Seriously he is THAT kind of person ) I noticed reviews here that have stated the service is beyond rude and and it's totally True, it's lousy and disrespectful especially when customers are paying out of their pockets to help keep you in business. Not sure where these people learned hospitality but it really shows that they are lacking in that department severely. BEWARE when you eat here. Horrible experience all all around.",

The food comes hot and quick. This place looks like an old 50s diner that they turned into a Vietnamese restaurant. It's not decorated to nice but it's clean. The restrooms are always very clean. When you want some Vietnamese food at a reasonable cost with no frills this is a great place",

The building is unassuming in an old diner's location.  I started with iced tea. It was very sweet and I liked it once I got past it not being the typical tea. For my lunch I chose the chicken noodle bowl which reminded me of a deconstructed Pho. Everything in the bowl was very tasty and very fresh. It came with a carrot sauce on the side for dipping. All other sauces were served on the side to add as you please as well. I liked being able to choose my own flavors.  Pricing was very reasonable. The waitress that served us was very sweet and took good care of us during our visit.",

Broth - great.  Noodles - Great.  Thai Ice Tea - Nice yet expensive.  5.  Price - Not too shabby except too many Thai Ice Tea!!!

Outside, it still has the appearance of the previous Diner that used to occupy this location. Despite its appearance on the outside, I was willing to give it a try. After all, sometimes the best places are those \"hole in the wall\" spots.   Walking in, I was encouraged by all the people dining in the restaurant.  Once I received a menu from a distracted employee, I was really hopeful that this was going to be my new favorite place.  The menu offered so many wonderful choices that sounded amazing in print. Problem is- the dishes we chose did not live up to our expectations.  I chose the lemongrass chicken chili -since we were at a lemongrass cafe. The dish consisted of pieces of chicken that were cooked with white onions and spices. Not gross, but not good. The sauce was too thick and was more like a paste. My wife opted for the lemongrass beef with noodles. The dish was cold and not what she was hoping for.    The service was horrible. The guy came to the table and says \"you ready\"?  I asked him a question on the two dishes that I was debating on. His response was that everything on the menu was good. Ok pal, that didn't help at all. Our drinks were not refilled until we were done with dinner-which bugs me.   Perhaps we didn't choose the best dinners off the menu, but I have to imagine that the service will still suck-\"if\" we do come back.",

They close at 10 and are telling people at 9:45 they will have to get the food to go(they went somewhere else....go figure). As far as the food it's just OK. I have eaten in Pho places all over and some are a little better than others but they are all pretty much the same. Just give me a large portion with pleanty of vegg on the side and I'll be happy. Pho 8 opening across the street is gonna put a serious crimp in thier numbers. Or maybe it already has they were basicly empty when we were there?!?",

It was nice to find such great food in an old Denny's Diner",

My son always gets chicken spring rolls and #41 Pho with nothing green!  They are so go to make every dish exactly as you wish, down to the noodle and extra vegtables.    The friendly atmosphere adds to the dining experience where the owner is on the floor and doesn't hesitate to pull up a chair or join you in your booth.    Lemongrass is always the restaurant of choice when we eat out!  Thank you for bringing vietnamese food to my family!",

We had the most wonderful experience. It was our first time at a vietnamese restaurant and our server , Lisa was super helpful! We ordered the shrimp toast as an appetizer. When it came out it also had gorgeous fresh herbs and lettuce on the plate.Lisa explained to us that you wrap the shrimp toast in the lettuce with the fresh herbs and use the dipping sauce. I never would have known what to do!! Let me tell you, IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! The bread it was on was fantastic !  We decided to try the pho, my first time! It was a warm bowl of goodness! Once again, Lisa was super helpful and so friendly and told us we might want to put some cirracha (sp?) hot sauce in our pho...this just added another yummy dimension. We also met the owner, Tansy, she was a lovely woman also. Let me say that our adventure was awesome! I cant wait to go again!!!",

We had the spring rolls with peanut sauce, a large bowl of chicken pho, and the vermicelli with grilled pork and pork meatballs.  Everything was very good quality and the wait staff and owner were very friendly.  The pork meatballs in the vermicelli were particularly good - lean, good texture and flavorful.  In fact, all of the ingredients were fresh, of good quality and the meats were all very lean.  Nice mixed crowd of all types here as well - families, couples, etc...  Recommended for a good quality neighborhood restaurant, and something very different (in a very good way) from typical suburban Las Vegas restaurants.   Seemed to be a reasonable value as well for the quality.  This appears to be a good quality local small business that is important to support to have a diversity of choice and to support small businesses in Henderson.",

    "text": "The greatest thing about Lemongrass is its location.  Being the first Vietnamese place in Henderson to my knowledge, it's great to save the 20 minutes going to Chinatown.  I had the grilled pork and eggrolls on vermicelli.  The dish itself was probably a 7 out of 10, but definitely tasty, fresh, and reasonable ($9).  The same dish is $6 or 7 at Pho So No 1, my favorite Viet cafe in town.  The service was decent.  We had to get the waitress' attention a couple of times for water/napkins, but it wasn't a big deal.  She was very attentive once we got her attention.  When I must have Vietnamese, I will go to Pho So No 1.  However, if I want the food and experience without the driving, Lemongrass is a grea substitute.    Also, the diner building is kind of weird with the club lighting inside, but it's cool.  Way to be green and take over an existing space instead of building more and more and adding to the vacant space in the Valley.",

He will never return until 20 minutes later when the soup comes out. I am pretty sure they dont have to make this to order. Soak the noodles, add the broth and rare beef and serve. It can come out in 5 minutes. While I waited I began to notice the mini-blinds were so dirty and then I started wondering what else was dirty. When the large bowl of pho I ordered to share with my youngest arrived, it had like 4 slices of beef. I asked the owner if this was right since I ordered a large. He says that is normal. No attempts to fix it. Well I won't be returning and the food is just meh!",

The design of the building reminds me of a 50s diner from New Jersey, but it's decorate inside to change the exterior look. The menu has a nice selection. You get a huge portion for the price. The food is good. It's nothing awesome to rave about, but it's not so-so either. I would definitely return. It's a good place for a person on a budget.",

The soup and the sauce they put on the noodles are very salty and the meat, seafood and veggies are not fresh. The seafood taste like frozen food. After the food was served, nobody even came to our table to ask us how's the food or if we need anything else and there were only 6 customers (including us) in there so they can't say they are busy.  Maybe they knew their food is bad and they don't want to hear it from us. Pricey too.  Would not recommend this place and will never go back here. Pho Saigon 8 which is less than a mile away from this restaurant is alot better or go to Spring Mountain...lots of choices.",

The broth has a savory meaty flavor which is very important to me and just as equally (or actually more) important, they don't skimp on the meat!~ ^_^ It's also nice that you get a generous amount of extras, jalepenos, mint, bean sprouts, hoisin sauce, etc. to add in whether you ask for it or not.   I'm not sure how people are thinking the broth is too greasy/salty, all good broth is to a point, since that's where some of your flavor comes from and a bland soup broth is a big no-no. The only non-praise I have for this place is that you have to spend $10 to use a credit card and I also wasn't impressed with the spring rolls, too subtle of a flavor for me even with the sauce.  P.S : I wish they would stay open later! 11pm sounds perfect!~",

While taking pics of my food, for Yelp, I dropped my phone in the Pho!! Fortunately, it survived to take a few more before I had to shut it off to let it dry out ;)   I've ordered the same thing both times. Small Chicken Pho & BBQ Pork Banh Mi!  They offer plenty of Thai Basil, lime, sprouts & chili's. Sometimes even a bug or two hiding in them. Oh well, at least they don't charge for the extra protein ;)   They have a very extensive menu! Someday I hope to try their other offerings, but I just can't get away from those 2 delicious items I love so much :D   I definitely dig the 50's Diner look it has going on the outside ;) The service is a little sketchy, but overall they are pretty friendly. Regardless, they deserve everyone of my 5 stars & more!",

Ordered pho and fried, crispy tofu with nuoc mum sauce and got tea. It took forever so we finished our tea and asked for more, which never came until I reminded the senior lady that she took our pot and never returned. The tofu was way too soft and they gave us peanut sauce instead of the nuoc mum that we already had a discussion about. While seating there eating my pho, I watched the waiter put a straw in his mouth to pull the paper off and then put the straw in a drink and take it to a customer. That's pretty disgusting!

My only qualms are that the fish sauce is not strong enough and they don't allow debit transactions under $10...I even offered to add a tip to the total to make it reach beyond $10 and they said no. I know credit card companies charge the business for each transaction...but many people don't carry cash and it's a convenience factor to be able to pay with my card.

Only because the setting inside and outside reminds me of one of those retro diner spots where someone comes out with roller blades or something.. ?  anyways, i was digging it.. walking in.. it was very quiet.. now it started to feel like one of the mid-west saloons.. to my left there was a bar and to my right is where a few people were sitting and eating..   we were seated by our host.. who then became our waiter.. and started us off with something to drink..   i got the combination special.. i also liked how there's an option for the size- regular or large.. so if you're really hungry.. go for the large or order two regulars i guess.. noodle broth ratio was really good.. the taste is as simple as pho can be.. and the meat was nice and tender.. vegetables and mint was fresh!  waiter seemed to be just about business.. because he was straight to the point.. and didn't really engage in a conversation.. could be a good or bad thing.. i didn't mind it..  everything went well until i found out that they don't accept a credit/debit card if the order was $10 or less... which was weird.. ill take the extra charge.. but to completely deny my card?.. not a fan of that.. so i ended up paying for one my co-worker's meal because he too did not have any cash.. with that said.. this place is a good cheap spot for pho..  enjoy!",

The Pho is tasty, the price point is right on, they give you a plate of different goodies to add to your bowl. (Jalapeno, bean sprouts, lemon etc) The restaurant itself is an old converted 50's diner.  It could be a little cleaner, which is my major hiccup and complaint here. They were fairly busy though, so it doesn't appear to be a deterrent.  Overall, I think I'd give it another shot myself, but only if in the area.",

Then you realize that you're in a Vietnamese restaurant. Oh and the pho is good too.  On this particular trip, I ordered my usual. Steak and lean brisket pho, large size. The broth is very tasty and the meat is plentiful. Also, I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls which were not what I expected. I expected that the spring rolls would be deep fried but were actually wrapped like a summer roll. SO make sure you double check before ordering.  Lemongrass Cafe has a variety of Vietnamese options along with vegetarian dishes. Its a very complete menu that would satisfy everyone's palate. My go to spot on cold Vegas nights.",

Good vegetarian options, but be sure to say \"Vegetarian\" or you may get the \"vegetable\" option (which might have meat broth).  The vegetarian Pho is delicious! I like the tofu- vegetables option. They are generous with the add-ins - basil, sprouts, peppers, etc.  Also very good is the Lemongrass Tofu - which is like a thick curry - not too spicy, but enticingly pungent, and redolent of lemongrass. I order it just so I can legitimately say \"redolent\".  This cute place needs a little updating. Some booths are held together with duct tape (literally).  Really 3.5 stars - slightly better than \"A-OK\" - rounded up for delicious Vegetarian Pho on a cold drippy day.",

    "text": "It's been quite a while since I've eaten here so time to bring a newbie and check it out. The first thing I noticed was how many new businesses are in this jumble of strip centers. My friend drove herself and she had a difficult time just finding the restaurant since she's not been here before. I'll start by saying that in the past at 12:30 the place was jammin with a healthy lunch crowd comprised of what was typically a largely Asian crowd. This Monday we found the place literally empty other than the two of us. I heard the phone ringing a lot with orders to be picked up for takeout. This was definitely what was keeping the woman in charge busy as well as the guy helping her. I'd ordered two appetizers which arrived as my friend did and she sat down and we began to eat but she had no setup of silverware, napkin or drink and my iced tea was empty. We waited until finally flagging the woman down to the table and asked for a drink and a fork. She returned to her spot by the register and took up her task at hand and we waited until I finally got up and asked her for a fork. My friend commented perhaps this was why the place was empty. Service was not at all attentive and felt almost begrudging. I realized she and the guy both seemed preoccupied, likely from the prep of the takeout. You ask why I give 4 stars in spite of the service and I can honestly say I did not feel the woman was being rude, just very preoccupied plus the food was solidly good. We shared a vegetable crepe full of succulent mushrooms and sprouts, veggie egg rolls and some chicken/veggie fried rice. It was all delicious. So, I will come back for the food not warm friendly service which incidentally I've received from this very woman in the past. When she saw my empty iced tea she refilled it with water?! At one time there was a cool & friendly guy waiting tables here who I mentioned in my last review. Too bad he's gone but the good food is still here!",

You could miss it if it you aren't on top of your directions game.   Entering the restaurant we were greeted courteously and seated right away. I was surprised by how large their menu is. This is much more than just a Pho shop.  I had #68 vermicelli noodles with fried egg rolls, fried pork and sausage. The most pleasant thing about my dish was the lemongrass taste in the sausage. The eggroll and the pork were good standards in the big bowl.  Everyone in our group were very happy with the amount and quality of the food. The service was fast and the waiters were on point keeping drinks filled and clearing dishes.   The tab for three people, three huge bowls of food and one ice tea was under $29.00. This restaurant is a great choice when you can't or don't want to venture out of Henderson good Vietnamese food.",

    "text": "Let me start my review with mentioning the location as it is a bit odd. Lemongrass is located in the same shopping center as the Regal Cinemas. It's in an old style diner building. Really upon first glance you wouldn't realize it's not a diner.   On to the review....  One of the main reasons I chose Lemongrass was because they have vegetarian options and I was really really craving pho.   Service was pretty straight forward. The servers don't really chat you up and aren't very outgoing, but they get the job done. The server who seated us quickly came over to take drink orders and then food orders. It was very straight to the point, sorta let's get your orders and move on, which I was fine with.   I ordered the vegetarian pho. The vegetarian option is made from vegetarian broth. I ordered it with tofu and mixed vegetables, which I recommend. The food came out rather quickly. The broth wasn't overpowering. I have been to other restaurants where the broth is too salty and/or too oily. This was not the case at Lemongrass. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and crisp. You could tell that they were fresh. It wad severed with all the trimmings, fresh bean sprouts, basil, etc.   On my newly adopted vegetarian lifestyle I was very happy to learn that there was still a place where I could get my long time favorite dish, pho.   Tip:  When I visited, the jasmine iced tea was complimentary. I highly recommend this if you enjoy jasmine tea. Hopefully they keep it complimentary.   This will serve as my go to spot when I am craving pho.",

They have a kid working there who was so rude to my family and I,  If I didn't know any better I would slap the shit out of him every time I see him. But I understand he is just a kid.  I hope he grows up soon because his behavior and attitude is not good for his family business.    Taste:  4 stars   From the items I have tried in total from here they were all pretty tasty.  Although I have only tried about 7-8 items on their menu.  I can't speak for the entire menu.  But they seem to be pretty consistent as far as the dishes being tasty but nothing to really boast about to tell people it's a must.  Price:  5 stars  Very affordable.  Cheaper or about the same with most pho places around town.  My only compliant is  the price of the egg rolls.  It's about $7 for 4 small pieces.  Definitely not worth it for the price.    Portion size:  4 stars  Some of the appetizers are a bit over priced for the portion size.  All the main entrees I have tried from The pho to the pork chops and Hong Kong style noodles were all good potions and enough to fill you up.    Overall: 3.5  Place offers a wide selection of Vietnamese dishes to chose from.  Decently priced and affordable with the exception of a few appetizer items.  Tasty meals with more than enough portions to satisfy. Unfortunately the worst service I've ever experienced and on several occasions.  So bad that I've decided to never step foot in this place again and should I decide to order from here it'll more than likely be take out.  But the chances of that happening for very slim.",

If you ask for more of something or have a special request, oh you'll see they're not thrilled. They talk poorly about other customers in front of people. It's really sad.

Who would have guessed that the diner I drove past as I entered the vast parking area of the Colonade Square Strip Mall would be the site of the Vietnamese Pho restaurant.  The interior of the restaurant still bares the unmistakable look and feel of a classic diner, with touches of Vietnamese art works decorating the walls of the restaurant.  It definitely has a different feel compared to the typical pho restaurants in Vegas and California.  I think that is good.  Their menu is pretty typical of other Vietnamese restaurants that serve pho, bun (vermicelli noodles) and rice dishes.  It also has the standard appetizer, drink and dessert menu.  I ordered their pho and thought it was pretty good.  Someone else ordered their bun with fish cake and that looks good as well.  As a group, we each enjoyed what we ordered.  But we were all most pleasantly pleased with the service provided on this visit, in spite of some less than positive comments on Yelp.  Our server was very organized in taking our orders, asking for our initials to note down next to our orders, which was tremendously helpful when it comes to settling our individual tabs at the end of the meal.  I can only assume the waiter was very used to requests for separate checks and have developed a very effective system for it.  Bravo!  Decor:  4/5  You will definitely remember the time when you had pho served in a diner :)  Food:  3/5  A-OK!  Service:  5/5  Food served promptly, drinks frequently refilled, settling our individual bills was hassle-free.  Parking:  5/5  Capacity was not an issue here.  4 stars overall.",

    "text": "I really don't have much new praise to add to the already heaping amount. I've been here a handful of times and I've never been disappointed. My regular at Vietnamese is Bun Tom Nuong (Vermicelli noodles with shrimp and fish sauce) and I tried their fatty beef pho once. Everything is so good - and plenty of leaves, sprouts, lime, jalapenos to adjust the flavor to your liking. I always get the spring rolls and they are always delicious. This is my go-to pho when I'm on this side of town and want a cheap meal. Oh, and sometimes there is room left for dessert (only when I order a small, though - which is still so filling). Their mango/lychee dessert is to DIE for! All the flavors come together so well, and the fruit actually tastes fresh and sweet. Oooh, I'm craving some just writing about it! Make sure you order it!!  Someone else wrote here that management may have changed recently, and over the course of a year or two of coming here, I noticed the service did get slightly better. It was never bad, but I noticed how attentive they were the last time I went. I've never had a problem with getting seated quickly or having prompt service, however. Oh, and I love how Lemongrass is right next to the movie theatre!  I would definitely recommend this place to those who wants to sooth a sore throat to those who want to expand their tastebuds (not that us Yelpers need that). I love Pho!!",

It didn't leave you smelling like pho. You all know what I'm talking about... That broth seeps out of your pores all day, but this place didn't leave me feelin' like that.

Reasonable pricing and food was good. Family and I got #53 (seafood pho), spring rolls, a beef and broccoli plate, and an egg banh mi. The banh mi is small, barely a foot. I was imagining the baguette would be longer. However, the other food had a satisfying portions. I could come back if it was a last resort.

Since we can speak Viet so there was no difficulty ordering food. They actually speak English well so there was no problem for the service.  My recommendation is not to drink the water if you are from other states. Reason? LV water tastes different and unpleasant. You should bring your own water to satisfy your thirsty.  One minus for their food is the vermicelli. Its like they use the frozen ones and put them into microwave to make it soft and hot. Not the fresh one.  Their deserts including ice cream, flan, sweet desert are too sweet and contain lots of glucose. Stay away if your on diet plan.  Stick with traditional Pho, not the other things if you don't want to get disappointed.",

The atmosphere was like oil and water.  But I will say this, there was a sweet older lady that did give us the comfort of \"family\". With that said, knowing that this was a family business, i give them credit for striving like they do.  Just wasn't too keen with the Asian welcome wagon.

We were craving some Vietnamese food and this place happened to be open on 4th of July and had decent reviews so we decided to check it out.   I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and honestly, I've had better. It was missing the pork blood and a truly authentic bowl of Bun Bo Hue will have pork blood. I really liked the sauce though. It was spicier than how other restaurants have but I'm not complaining. I love spicy foods.   Overall, it was decent. I like how they have the traditional dishes on their menu like Bun Cha and Banh Xeo. Most Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to usually just have the noodle soups and rice plates. So I thought it was pretty cool that they offered these dishes. If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely come back to try those dishes.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place after hearing mixed reviews from several different people. Upon arrival, it looks like a 50's diner with signs that it is a vietnamese joint selling pho. The interior seem like it was still the same as when it used to be a diner. The furnitures were old and some seats were ripped but you can hear Vietnamese music playing in the background. The interior decorated with plants and walls covered in Vietnamese paintings.  There was one other group eating and we were seated quickly.   Food:  - Nem nuong cuon (spring rolls with homemade pork sausage) with peanut dipping sauce (2/10)- it came out smaller than more places but u get three rolls (each cut in half). The nem tasted old and dried, as if they precook the nem and reheat it when you order this. The veggies were old and you can tell it has been sitting around for awhile and wasn't fresh. The peanut sauce was OK, it helped with forcing the spring rolls down our throats.    - Pho Dac biet (3/10) -I typically like to try the soup before adding condiments to it. The broth was lacking in flavor and definitely didn't have the rich and bold beef flavor that you normally get from a home cook meal. The meat was mediocre at best in teen of quality. The veggies that came with it was also old and not fresh.   - Bun bo hue (2/10) - I have been on the hunt to find a place that makes this delicious spicy beef noodle soup and still haven't come across a place that calls my name to come back. This soup was very oily and had a weird after taste. I don't know what it is but that distinct taste overpowered the whole dish.    - Bun thit nuong, nem nuong, cha gio (6/10) - one dish that it's hard to get wrong but once again the homemade nem nuong was dried and tasted old. The thit nuong was decent and had a nice char flavor that made the dish more bearable to eat. Cha gio had no flavor and needed more seasoning in the filling. The veggies once again was old.   - Thai tea did not taste like Thai tea   Overall, I would not recommend nor come back here to try anything else. I will continue my hunt to find a place for bun bo hue. I gave them an extra star because we had no issue with service. The staff and owner were very friendly and nice.",

Here's the thing, if you normally eat Banh Mi's then you feel my pain, when you see the size of these Vietnamese Sandwiches served here... if you peep my picture you see the size compared to my small hand. Although the size is on the smaller side the actual sandwich stuffing is quite delicious.   The people that own the restaurant are sweet, so because of the customer service and flavorful (small) sandwiches they offer here, I may consider coming back.   The location of this restaurant is a little tricky. The easiest thing I can say is that it's directly across my favorite Hawaiian food spot, Island Flavor (off of Eastern Ave, just off the 215) in the same shopping center. It's the silver building that looks like an old school diner.",

But they were so rude about us ordering a small soup to go, I'm just done with this place.  Too bad, since we come here at least 3-4 times a month.

    "text": "In the southeast side of Las Vegas this is my go to pho place. It's a Vietnamese restaurant in a dinner space. I've always had really good service. The food comes out quick, the food comes out hot, and the food comes out tasty.  Their spring rolls are really tasty. I prefer the shrimp over the nem nuong pork patty ones here. Their peanut sauce is a little runnier but flavor is there. They give you four for $7/$8 bucks which is great.  The pho always has a lot of meat which trumps the china town spots. They also offer smaller bowls.  They have all the Vietnamese staples like ban xeoh and even ban mih sandwiches.  I think the space has an off putting smell which I have no idea if they have any control over but this is to help them improve.  Also the pho is definitely not the best in town in flavor but it's still solid and overall good. I think it could use some salt but hey I can add my own.  The older grandma lady is my favorite as she seems very proud to serve the food here. She does the hostessing and takes payments.",

You ever been served pho and you stick your chopsticks in the bowl and find yourself having to separate the noodles because they're all stuck together?? I can deal with that, but I don't necessarily like to.  Other than pho, egg rolls and spring rolls; we've had the combination banh sandwich which comes with jalapenos so be careful, and the fried pork. My kids love the fried pork! Thai tea is always a winner too! I have yet to try a dessert, I've always been too full to add a dessert to my meal.

    "text": "Wow...I am so amazed by how a Vietnamese spot can f'ed up banh mi so badly.  I to-go 5 Vietnamese sandwiches.  3 Combination (pork, ham and pork roll), 1 grilled beef, and 1 house made pork sausage.    Cons 1. Bun - more on a big hot dog bun than a French baguette.  So compared to all the other Vietnamese places that sells Banh mi, Lemongrass Cafe has the tiniest baguette ever.  It wasn't even toasted. 2. Meat - skimpy and totally not worth it to consume.  The house made pork sausage was thin and flavorless.  I make the nem so much better than this restaurant.  The grilled beef looks more like sauteed bits of beef.  The cold cut tasted like Asian store brought.  Supposedly there is pate...I didn't see any, didn't taste any. 3. Herbs/veggies - there was no cilantro in any of our banh mi.  The carrots must be pickled in just water and sugar because it was not sour at all.  I question whether they know how to pickle or definition of pickling. 4. Mayo - or lack of.  What the heck is going on?  Can't even spread some mayo?   5. Soy Sauce - I opened up the banh mi and did not see soy sauce.  Pros Not a damn thing I can say here.  I grew up eating banh mi (Houston, Westminster, etc.), so I know what banh mi should be.  The banh mi here is a effin disgrace.  They are the worst banh mi I ever had.  Everything was wrong, no redeeming quality.  Because there are not many banh mi places in Hendo, I decided to give this place a try.    I will NEVER return.  Lee Sandwiches is still better than this place.  Too bad China Town is quite a distance from where I live.  Also, as I was waiting to pay for the worst banh mis ever, there was a funky smell at the front register area.  Eew.",

We ordered the spring rolls, which were delicious- fresh with crunchy rice noodles inside. I was eager to try my entree, the Pork Chili Lemongrass. When my order came out, it was a little smaller than I expected. Usually when I go out for dinner, I eat half and save half for lunch the next day. Oh well, I figured I had just worked out and it probably just looked small in my hungry state of mind. I sampled a piece. Hmm.. very chewy. The flavor was great- perfectly spiced and the onions had a great texture; maybe it was just a bad piece. But my entire dish was like that. As small as the serving was, my jaws started to get tired from chewing through it. I don't think I had a single piece that was good. Wait, yes I did- the piece I sampled from my boyfriend's dish. His turned out fine. This place gets 2 stars instead of  because the service was great- 2 people kept our water glasses full the entire time. Plus, my boyfriend thought his Vermicelli with Pork, Pork Sausage, and Egg roll was tasty (and it was). He doesn't blame still being hungry afterwards on the portion size, even though we ended up going to the Havana Grill (same parking lot) right after to get something else. I'll give it another chance, someday. Maybe the dish I ordered just happened to be the worst thing on the menu.",

They were out of the shrimp spring rolls which sounded the best out of all the appetizers, so we ended up ordering each of beef and chicken satay.  Folks, I recommend the beef satay-it had curry taste to it, but the chicken tasted like nothing.  The dipping sauce was delicious too!  The little dish of cucumbers were a bonus. We ordered: Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, Pad See Woo, Rib eye steak, and few other dishes I cant remember the names of- one was a shrimp dish, chicken with cashews, and something else.  MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM IF YOU DON'T WANT SPICY AND MAKE SURE THEY MAKE IT CLEAR ON THE TICKET! We ordered everything on a scale of 0-10, a 0 and all the food ended up coming out regular. We had someone who gets a bad reaction if they ate anything remotely spicy. Well, he took a bite of it and had a really bad reaction.  We called the manager over and told him and the manager didn't seem happy that we complained. The manager was able to cook something up within minutes, but the food and the appetizers took forever FYI.   Overall the food was good, but not much different than your neighborhood Thai/Asian cuisine places.  The portions were TINY... I mean I can probably eat a whole plate in 3 bites and I'm a girl.  Not worth the $$ for regular food, but if you are craving Thai, the Pad Thai was really good. 3 star because the service was slow, portions were TINY, and price was too high!",

My nail guy said the BBQ pork was pretty good, so I headed there with my daughter to check it out.  I ordered the Bun thit ( BBQ Pork) over vermicelli noodles, eggrolls and nuoc mam...it was alright, definitely not like mommas but was better than driving all the way to Chinatown to get decent Vietnamese food.  My daughter had her usual, Pho with no meat or veggies ( she's only 10 and hates onions). I did taste her pho, the broth wasn't bad ( again not like mom's!).  We also ordered the shrimp wrapped sugarcane- which actually came out with no sugarcane but was again no bad. It came with the lettuce, mint, basil and a few other herbs that most Americans won't eat and I don't know how to say in English.  Overall, I am just SO happy there is a Vietnamese place in Henderson.  I would definitely recommend to anyone that has never had Vietnamese before, it's so healthy and delicious!",

I also had suon bo nuong, grilled beef shortribs with white rice. so yummy! they are the same as kal bi & quite good. the rice was perfect nice & sticky, not dried out. the hostess came up to me & asked if the beef was too salty but i told her that this was what i was hoping for, i love kal bi & would be back again to order this entree. not to mention they have coca cola products which is rare for restaurants in las vegas. the server was nice & attentive. i hope this restaurant does well because the food is awesome.",

Lemongrass Cafe is not in the upper tier of good vietnamese cuisine but is consistently decent. The broth of the Pho wasn't fatty and had a nice taste to it but the flavor of the broth wasn't deep. It didn't have the rich beef flavor i personally enjoy. I was very dissapointed by the vietnamese crepes here, they didn't have much flavor at all probably because the shrimp, pork and veggies were thrown into the middle of the cooked crepe instead of slowly cooked with the batter. The vermicelli dishes were good and consistent with most vietnamese restaurants. The staff was very kind, accomodating and i would have gone back but Pho Saigon 8 just opened up across the street.",

Everything was very clean (I can get turned off by dirty washrooms - no problem here).  My husband went under protest and said he would TRY to find something he could eat. After inhaling the very fresh egg rolls (he pronounced them the best ever), he moved on to a combination sandwich and a \"small\" beef broth soup (not pho).  He ate everything, even though that was the largest \"small soup\" we have ever seen.  I had the pork with vermicelli.  My only complaint is everything was so good there was no room for dessert.  Service was excellent.  The owner came and chatted with us a few minutes afterward.  Very nice people.  Dinner for two with drinks under $30 - cannot be beat.",

It might not be quite as good or cheap as some of the places in/near Chinatown, but Lemongrass Cafe is much closer to where I live and it's nice to have good Vietnamese food without the drive.  And actually, it seems like the quality of the pho has improved over the last few months.  The only other things I have had on the menu were the egg rolls (good) and the bun with lemongrass beef (very good).  I keep wanting to try some of the stir-fried items, but I usually only decide to eat here when I am craving pho.  This is a good place for people who want to have Vietnamese food without driving across the city, and it also would be a good place for people wanting to try Vietnamese food for the first time.",

My biggest complaint was the pho, they claim shrimp, squid, crab and fishballs. What was placed in front of me contained fishballs, FAKE crab (which is fish), and shrimp....so basically, I got fish and shrimp pho...not a piece of squid or crab in site. It was good, but hey, don't bullshit me on what you are putting in the dish. The spring rolls were OK the wrapping was starting to dry out, been sitting out a little too long--the filling was tasty (though a bit bland) and fresh. The Gi Xoai/Green Mango Salad rocked the house. I'm not sure how to describe it, I ordered it based on another yelpers recommendation, it was the shining star out of everything we had. The pork sausage sandwich was good but damn, throw a little mo' pig between that bread, just a little. Oh, and the ice tea, a little different and delish. Service was good. In a land overridden with homogenized chain restaurants, I can see why this place is well loved by those that live close by, but I would not drive out of my way for a return visit. Lemongrass... it doesn't suck, it doesnt kick ass.",

It was empty at the moment and we discovered that they opened 11 days before we went in.  We ordered Bun Boe Hue and wasn't really wowwed by the Soup, but the other ingredients were fine.  The Soda Chanh and Vietnamese Coffee were excellent.  The place is family owned and operated and the service is top notch compared to other asian establishments.  The waiters, Bryan and Ching are especially helpful.  The owners (a caucasian male and his vietnamese wife) are very customer oriented and try to please customers from all types of backgrounds.    On subsequent visits, the food got better (They must've changed the chef) and we tried spring rolls, the mango salad, the Pho, the beef stew, etc.  Everything is better than average for Vegas.  It's not little Saigon, but I'll take it rather than have food thrown at us.    I'd give them 5 stars when I'd pick this over any restaurant in Little Saigon.",

    "text": "You never forget your first love or your first.....time. This is where I nervously had my Pho cherry popped a while ago so it has always been special to me. Let's just say my first time was A-MAZING and I fell in love with Pho and Lemongrass Cafe on that day.  - It's always hot and spicy  - Cures hangovers and helps with head colds  - No noodle and all white meat action works with my low carb lifestyle  - While it travels from my pallet to my belly the warmth brings me peace and calm......a Culinary Nirvana.  - Using chopsticks makes me happy (it's the small things in life)   After being to several other Vietnamese spots Lemongrass is my go to for Chicken Pho. All white meat, fresh veggies, and a small that I cannot finish is $6.95. I usually get mine without the noodles and extra side of peppers and load it up with hoisin and chili sauce, etc. They never skimp on the amount of meat or it's quality. It's quite simply, Pho done right. I would also like to live a little and try a fried egg Banh Mi here eventually.   The service is consistantly attentive, friendly, and quick. The owner always greets me with a smile and welcomes me. I especially enjoy this when I am here by myself in sweaty gym clothes which is frequent. (Yes, I am the sweaty white girl in the corner. Don't hate. My Pho is spicier than yours.) The restaurant is always very clean down to the ladle spoons and ramekins for the sauce if you are a dipper;)   I would gladly give Lemongrass 5 stars, but my one issue is that the temperature never seems right in here. I purposely keep a sweatshirt in my car just for Lemongrass in the event it's freezing. I've been there a few times where I hadn't been to the gym before, but the temperature was so \"off\" I had a fancy boob sweat line when I was done eating. I know, sexy.   Now that it's not Africa hot outside I imagine I will be craving Pho more than my average twice a week. TRUST I will be at Lemongrass Cafe fo' sho' fo ' a hot bowl of Vietnamese goodness to soothe my soul and take me back to that happy place.....",

    "text": "I'm surprised this place isn't called the Lemongrass Diner, considering it is situated inside ones of those 50s style diners with the silver metallic exterior complete with diner countertop and barstools inside.  The only thing missing were portable jukeboxes at each booth that allowed one to play cheesy asian lounge music.    Don't let the juxtaposition fool you, since the food here is 100% authentic.  A friend and I ordered up the crispy spring rolls (cha gio) and a large bowl of the combination pho (meatballs, tripe, tendon, flank steak).   Here is the breakdown of our meal:  Crispy spring rolls (4.5 stars) These were definitely the highlight of the meal.  Aside from being perfectly fried, the filling contained taro, jicama, and black mushrooms to accompany the ground pork/shrimp.  My tastebuds were doing somersaults since there was so much flavor and texture in addition to the savory meat component.  The velvety creaminess from the taro, the light crunch from the jicama, and the chewy mushrooms all came through.  Wrapping each roll in a fresh lettuce leaf and a few sprigs of fresh mint and then dunking it in some house-made fish sauce, we were both pretty much on cloud umami.    Combination pho (3.5 stars) Definitely a noticeable upgrade from the pho offered across the street at Pho Saigon 8, which I had termed \"pho-gettable\".  The broth has a richer depth of flavor, but is a tad bit on the oily side.  Noodles were adequate but the beef components were a bit tough in regards to the tripe and there were pieces of meat that were overly intertwined with strands of fat, likely contributing to the greasy broth.  Definitely will hit the spot if you just need a nice bowl of pho on a cold evening if you're in the neighborhood, but not necessarily a destination spot worth making a long drive bypassing options in Spring Mountain.    Service/Ambience (4 stars) I actually kind of liked the surrealism of the diner vibe.  It was as though my friend and I were hatching a scheme over pho in some Asian remake of Pulp Fiction.  The owners were very friendly and hospitable as well.  My only regret was not having enough room in my belly to sample their vietnamese coffee or their mango ice cream topped with fresh asian fruits.     Definitely a solid option for pho if you're a Henderson resident taking into account the other options available, although the crispy spring rolls just may be worth the trip if you are stumbling in from elsewhere across town.",

Many of their dishes can be adjusted, with tofu subbed in for meat. I'm not afraid to get the vegetarian pho and a vegetarian sandwich and then proceed to dip the sandwich into the pho, French-dip style.  This place used to be a '50s themed diner which has had some Vietnamese stuff put around the room and on the walls, so the overall ambience and decor is a bit strange: Viet-American-Retro. The service is hit or miss. Some servers are on top of things and fast, others, not so much.  What keeps me coming back is the food and the willingness to accommodate a picky vegan customer. A lot of Vietnamese places wouldn't even try; this one not only tries, but succeeds.  By the way, they have excellent Vietnamese coffee for vegetarians, though I think they used real condensed milk, so it's not an option for vegans. Ask and find out; things like this are always in flux.",

In Las Vegas?  Yes, why not.  It was NOT close by. 15 minutes or so. It was inside a strip mall and it looked like a diner from the outside.  ORDERED:  *SPRING ROLLS - Not as good as Pho Kim Long's, but tasty regardless. Good portions.  *BUN THIT NUONG - Need more greens, but the meats and noodles were solid.  *SODA CHANH (lemon soda) - HIt the spot. Fresh and fizzy.  I tasted my friend's soup and the broth was amazing. Next time, the soup for me.  Dinner for 2 was $30.  Friendly staff (they spoke Vietnamese) and clean dining interior.  RECOMMEND for your Vietnamese food cravings in Sin City.",

Told them we were a party of 6 including my one year old . Then we asked them for a highchair the guy said oh I thought you had 6 I gave you booth for 6. Okay so we waited 15mins to put our order in. That was okay.  When we walked in there was a couple who had been waiting for their food . Then it was my party . Two girls who walked in 20 mins after us and then 30 mins a elderly woman. We waited about another 30 mins for our appetizers of egg rolls and spring rolls and the table of two girls got there appetizers the same as us.  The couple who was in there first ordered pho. My party ordered pho. The two girls and elderly woman ordered pho. They brought out the two girls first then 15 mins later brought out the first couples order  . They were already super pissed so said they will not eat and left . So the waiter took there food and placed it on our table . We understand they did not touch it but you don't show people that we get somebody's rejected food.we left and will not be returning to here ever again. Never went to a pho place and got served really long. Their broth should already be done in the first place!!!!",

The first time the broth was greasy, I picked up the food right before they were closing so I attibuted it to maybe it being the last of the broth or something.  The second time I picked it up right after work and it was the same, if not worse.  I only ate half and put the other half in the fridge and the next day, all the fat had formed a thick layer on top, which has NEVER happened before with my left over pho.  I was so grossed out.  I want to give them one more chance and maybe tell them, just because I loved this place, but I'm not sure.  I'll go on a pho-break and think about it.",

    "text": "This is the only pho spot that I know of that caters to vegetarians, so for that reason alone, I am a huge fan of Lemongrass Cafe! You have to request the vegetarian broth because it's not on the menu. The broth is very flavorful and I barely have to add any lime to it! I always get the tofu pho with veggie broth. You can either have them add the extra veggies to it, or just leave it plain with just the onion and cilantro. Just make sure you specify.   When I used to eat meat, I remember squeezing tons of lime in my pho broth to give it flavor. So for this veggie broth to be delicious enough without a bowl of lime, I think that speaks for itself.  I also like the lemongrass tofu vermicelli dish. If you're a veggie, ask for a side of the special soy sauce blend instead of the fish sauce. The tofu texture is perfect and tasty - not mushy in the least bit. I request it without bean sprouts because they get in the way.   The mango ice cream is yummy too. The portion is quite generous, so you can split it with one or two of your friends.   I love this restaurant - I can probably eat here every other day if I had the funds! For veggies who want a tasty soup or a delicious noodle dish, give this place a try. I got my other veggie friends to like it. If you see me, make sure to say wassup!!   Tofu pho is the truth, I'm just sayin'.",

You can tell their baguette is freshly made too.  Service is always excellent (compared to pho saigon 8 right across the street). The woman (who I think is the owner) is so sweet! I like that they offer fried tofu pho, although I get rare beef, tendon and I ask them if they can add tofu as well, which they did.   I have ordered take out pho from them several times. The first time, I asked if they could keeep the noodles and broth seperate and they said they already always do that. (Had to make sure, you never know and I don't want soggy noodles) They keep the broth in a styrafoam container along with raw meats, green onion/shallot/cilantro mixture and the noodles in a styrofoam plate on the side, and a small baggie with bean sprouts and basil. They give a little container of hoisin and sriracha all ready to be consumed!",

It was so horrible I don't even know how to begin to describe it.  The meat was cold and was barely there: You know I opened it up and thought \"where's the meat?\", \"where's the vegetables?\", and \"where's the mayo?\".  Now looking back i wish I had taken a picture.  I complained to the waiter, who proceeded to ask me if I had been to Lee's sandwiches and how he worked at Lee's and that Lee's was just like their sandwiches.  I proceeded to tell him how I grew up near and ate often in restaurants in Little Saigon in Garden Grove and I know what a good bahn mi is.

They don't pile a load of mint leaves and sprouts just to make it look like you're getting a deal they give you enough to fill your bowl without wasting. Their fried egg rolls were very crispy and the sauce to dip it in wasn't sweet and thick it was palatable. The iced tea had a touch of the culture which gives it a nice complimentary taste to the meal. It was a little confusing finding the place because there aren't signs on the marquees and it is the old diner lol. All you need is a big conspicuous sign on top of the restaurant with bold colors. I read someone else's review and naming it Vietnamese diner is appropriate and cute idea! The only complaint is to air out the place it feels stuffy and stale.",

Also, the waitstaff was really dismissive.  And my order took forever to come out.  There were only two other tables of patrons so it wasn't as though the place was packed.  Save yourself the trouble and drive out to one of the pho restaurants on spring mountain.",

I wish I could look pass that but I simply can't.  And the service was NOT there...the man we had as a server was literally dragging/scuffing (you could hear him approaching) his feet on the ground, he stood about 10-15 feet away from us just staring (there were only 2 tables in the place) and when he wasn't staring he was on his cell phone...not talking just texting or something.  I joined my party late and the very second I sat down he asked me if I was ready to order, no hello.  Which was fine I guess maybe I was in a hurry...but come to find out he had done the same to the other two in my party before I arrived.  I tried to smile at him and evoke something but nothing, not even a fake I'm trying to live off tips sort of interaction.  Zilch.  I've eaten here before...it's OK.  I had hoped for more flavor in the broth of the pho but I'm not exactly a pho expert...maybe it's suppose to be fairly bland?    My rating would have 2 stars but I'd been really craving pho so I gave it 3 stars...next time I'll try Pho Saigon 8 down the street...regardless of its mixed reviews.",

The night I went it was absolutely empty, so getting a seat wasn't a problem. The menu has all the typical Vietnamese dishes you would see in any other Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas, and the prices are *slightly* higher than other ones (I've noticed the Spring Rolls were about $6, compared to other places where they ranged from $4-$5).  I had the tofu and vegetable mix which comes with the addition of rice, and the place is filling enough to where it's a little hard to finish the whole meal in entirety! My server was helpful with pointing out some new stuff to try on the menu, and worked at the pace I was eating. The only downfall I experienced was the A/C in there, which was FREEZING! Besides that, Lemongrass is a pretty mediocre Vietnamese restaurant on the east side of town.",

    "text": "Buddy and I from work decided to go for a Pho Phix at lunch. We decided to forego our usual place close by to give Lemongrass a try due to their higher  average by the Yelpies.  Upon arrival we were concerned if the place was still open. The landscape is overgrown with weeds and the advertisement banners are in disrepair and faded. However the interior was well kept.  We sat at the counter for the comfort of sitting with room due to the fact that all the tables are booths (this really isn't a big deal to the general public unless you're over 6'3\" and 200lbs+). The stainless steel preparation area behind the counter seemed to have been cleaned with play-dough as there was a milky haze from previous cleaning attempts. I understand Stainless Steel is difficult to keep clean, but it is necessary.   We ordered some rolls as we waited for our Pho. The rolls were really good but the condiments and veggie plate needed a little more love. Our pho was ok, broth was not as rich as I'm used to and lacked a good portion of noodles.  Our rare beef was well done.  Our regular Pho place down the street has a lower rating but on this day they were leaps and bounds better Then Lemongrass Cafe. I can see how this place might have been good at one time but their lack of attention to detail recently has caused them to receive a low rating.",

This place was really disappointing for me, and I believe the food quality was really sub-par. My fiance and I started off the meal with some egg rolls. Hard to mess up, right? Wrong. The inside of the egg rolls were really mushy with no real flavor profile. It was just a jumble of mush (which I suspect was under cooked) with barely any seasoning. I tried soaking the egg rolls in their fish sauce which also lacked flavor and spice.   We also ordered their rice plate with grilled pork (Com Thit Nuong) which was mediocre. The meat didn't have that great grilled flavor and again the fish sauce didn't help at all. I nearly poured the whole bowl of fish sauce on my plate and it didn't help at all.  We didn't try their Pho which might be delicious, but that is a gamble in Vegas that I'm not willing to make. You'll see me dining at Pho Saigon 8 across the street which is so much better by far.",

I ordered plain pho without meat and my better half went with chicken pho and a chicken banh mi. We both had smalls which was more then enough.  I didn't try much of the chicken pho because he went a little bonkers with the chili sauce... to the point that he had broken out into a sweat and was crying from the heat. I am a baby when it comes to that! I did have a couple bites of the banh mi, the bread was nice and crunchy yet still soft, the chicken was seasoned deliciously and the veggies they put on it were so good. My pho was tasty, as other reviewers have mentioned the brother is nice and hot... but my noodles were a bit clumpy.   Service was a touch spotty. I didn't get a refill on my iced tea until I was done eating, and we ended up walking up to the cashier to pay because our check was not brought out to us. But the price was good, $21 for our food, my tea and a beer.   Overall I would rate Lemongrass Cafe a 3.5, but I am going to round down for the time being as I do plan on going back again in the future.",

    "text": "I've never expected great decor from Vietnamese eateries, but a Viet restaurant inside in 50's style diner is something I've never thought I'd see.  It's strange but understandable after the economic crash and restaurants closing over night causing property owners to rent out space quickly and cheaply.  Lemongrass is the exact place where you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  It serves up some of the most authentic everyday Vietnamese dishes, there are even a couple of specialties I've never seen anywhere else in Vegas.  There are the standard Pho noodle soups, vermicelli noodle salads, and Banh Mi sandwiches, which allow me to never have to drive to Chinatown if I have a craving for the usual fare.  But if you're a non-Vietnamese and have never had something besides the dishes listed above, let me draw your attention to a few Viet offerings that are less-known but just as delicious:  1. Stuffed Calamari: fresh squid stuffed with minced glass noodle, shrimp, and ground pork and then deep fried.  This dish is time-consuming to make and doesn't yield too much profit (which explains why I've mainly had it home-made) but completely yummy.  2.  Tuna in Tomato Sauce: a peasant favorite that stands the test of time; it brings me back to the days of when my grandma used to cook this for me.  It sounds simple and it is: tuna filets are fried and then topped with crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil.  Simplicity in peasant food is usually what makes it so emotional.  3.  Lotus Salad: usually seen at parties, a rare exception (we don't have too many salads) in Vietnamese cuisine that works.  Thin pieces of lotus stems are mixed with jicama, pork, shrimp, and mint, then topped with roasted peanuts and served with tamarind fish sauce.  A healthy alternative as an appetizer or main entree.",

The broth they use for their pho is absolutely addicting, the vegetables are always fresh and clean, and the appetizers are all so awesome, my eyes get bigger than my stomach. They also have a special satay sauce that's their own recipe, if you like garlic and spice, this sauce is meant for you.  I'm home 10 days a month, and I'd eat here everyday, if I could. It's a fairly new establishment and the staff there are all so very nice.  Good Luck & Enjoy",

The smell of cleaner upon entering was so strong, i asked to sit at another table.   We didn't recognize the staff so I'm not certain if they're under new management, but the server was incredibly rude during our time there. My boyfriend came to join us and the server hardly gave him any time to order, and tried to take the menu away from him.  It took forever to even get our appetizer, and we noticed that people who sat well after us were served their food before us. The lemongrass beef was one of my favorite dishes, that time, it was charred and not up to the quality that I expected it to be.   When we went up to pay, we had asked for the cash to be applied first with the remainder to be paid on the card. He ignored us and pointed to the minimum ten dollar credit sign, which wouldn't have been an issue but he was very rude about it so rather than putting some cash towards our bill first and dealing with the attitude, I just put it all on the card. It is an absolute shame to see the quality in service go down so drastically from where it used to be, and I will never go back.",

The dish is almost like eating pho -- minus the broth and beef!",

Dragon Ball Z Style, Viet food in a Johnny Rocket's atmosphere. HAHA - Smaller portions and higher-priced than what I'm used to when it comes to Viet food.  - The crepe seemed a bit expensive at a glance so we were hesitant to get it since at the Asian Garden Mall, Westminster, sells it for so much cheaper, and My GF's mom makes so many at a time...so we had to pass unfortunately. But maybe next time.  - Tiny fried egg rolls!! Although, I must note, it came out super fresh and crispy.  - Vermicelli was average. Fresh vegetables, but nothing remarkable for Vermicelli eaters.  - Seafood soup was delicious. Get it.  - Nice service! The Filipino server was able to relate to my Filipino parents. Haha.  - Good place for Viet food-newbs that don't want to deal with a language barrier.",

    "text": "The first time I came here, I thought, \"an old school diner that serves pho?\"  Don't let their appearance fool you, they serve great food here!  If you come with a big group, you'll have to split up into different booths.  They have booths that fit 4-6 people.  But other than having to split up, everything is else is spot on!  The servers are really nice, they bring out food in a timely manner, and don't have a problem splitting checks whenever I come with large groups of people.   I don't venture out too much when it comes to Vietnamese food, I tend to stick to Pho Dac Biet since it comes with everything. Thanks to my friends, I have recently discovered a new favorite, Banh Xeo.  It's what my friends described as a \"Vietnamese taco.\"  It is sooo much more than a taco.  It's like a crispy crepe filled with bean sprouts and shrimp that's folded into a taco.  You cut pieces of it, wrap it in lettuce with some of the other fresh herbs inside, and dip it into the sauce.  The mixture of fresh greens, the crispiness of the banh xeo, and sweetness of the fish sauce goes so well together.  It was love at first bite.  Another tasty way to eat this (although a bit more time consuming) is asking for rice paper to wrap it in like a spring roll.  I may like it more as a spring roll rather than being wrapped in lettuce.  If you're going to try banh xeo, it's a must to try it here!  I've ordered it at several other Vietnamese restaurants and sometimes the inside is soggy and anti-climactic.  I also enjoy the pho here, the broth has a nice flavor and there is a good amount of meat  They provide a lot of basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime with your pho.  My friends also enjoy the bun bo hue here.  Its very aromatic and packs a punch.  It's the perfect soup to soothe your throat when you're sick!    As expected with large groups, it's so hard to pick a place everyone's happy with, but Lemongrass Cafe has been a place we all can agree with and keep coming back to.",

Shrimp paste spring rolls are best in town as well. They do lag slightly for them to prepare them..  I am not a fan of their chicken in the chicken pho it is dry but so is every other place I've been to... the chicken broth is solid tho.

To me it is all about the broth and the broth here serves as a good baseline for when I make my own pho. The broth should be clear, have a balance of salt with a hint of sweet, and present an essence of the herbs used during simmering - and at Lemongrass - the broth succeeds in providing these baselines for me.   For the newbie get pho tai (a plain pho with rare beef), for the one that wants to try everything get pho dac biet (pho special with everything).",

This restaurant had character leaving some of the \"diner\" decor behind. Our server took our order right away. He was very attentive.

While their soup base is lacking a bit of flavor and the meat isn't top quality we appreciate the freshness. Plus, this is a great place for vegetarian options and the staff ensure that you are not eating something you shouldn't be. Try the vegetarian egg rolls! Really good! Not a 5 star place but we will continue to come back.",

    "text": "This was my first place to pop my pho cherry and will be my last because it is an all-around pleasure to eat at when I get that perpetual itch for Asian cuisine.  What I love the most is the atmosphere. It may look tacky and strange outside once being a diner, but inside is a gorgeous purple interior with eastern paintings to emphasize its cultural integrity.   I love their seafood pho here, it's pretty much what I get every time. Other places has added their own unique assortment of the seafood ingredient part but I've always found Lemongrass to be way simpler and always cooked to perfection in the type of fish they put in there, and they hold the boiled eggs thankfully.  I love love love springs rolls! While theirs is a bit on the small side, they give you three that are cut in half which seem to last much longer than rival pho restaurants who only serve two huge ones intact. Because for such a tasty appetizer to cost around $5, it better feel like it never ends!   Their peanut sauce for the spring rolls is more on the watery side, but they make up for it in so many other ways. Not only is their Jasmine Tea DIVINE, but it's complementary with your meal! I'm somewhat of an iced tea connoisseur and their tea is like liquid candy crack to me.  On top of it all, their staff is very friendly and patient, making the overall experience relaxed and fulfilling. Emphasis on filling.   And so relaxed that even though the cashier woman checking me out had to charge my card twice because she undercharged it the first time, it was absolutely no big deal. Though I must say my face got a little Kermit when she suddenly hissed \"Shit!\" after swiping my card the first time. But that definitely won't be the last time my card is swiped here because it's definitely my new regular spot!",

Went here for the second time since my first experience was a good one except this time the experience was not good and I do not think I will return here or even refer any of my friends and family to go here.  Went with my boyfriend and ordered our usual egg rolls, beef with rice and BBQ pork chops with rice.  Appetizers were served first, boyfriend ordered the pork eggrolls and I had the vegetarian egg rolls. His egg rolls came out first whereas I had to wait 10 more minutes for mine, usually the veggie egg rolls would come out first at other vietnamese restaurants since pork takes longer to cook. Whatever no big deal. As I was half way done with my appetizer, the entree came out...I mean since my appetizer was late, i didnt get to even finish it before my entree came out....whatever, I stop eating the app and go on to my entree BBQ pork and rice. It was good as usual taste wise, as I'm eating my second bite I noticed there's a strand of white hair grilled on there.  Disgusted, I showed it to the server, which what he replied with \" that's not a hair, that's part of the lemongrass\"...with which i replied \"I didn't order lemongrass pork I ordered BBQ pork\"....he insisted that all the BBQ has lemongrass.  I am Asian and I can differentiate between a hair strand and a lemongrass strand.  He walks away without offering me any alternatives to the problem.  I lost my appetite and left it there.   My bf finishes and I ask for the check....the server asks if I want a box for the hair contaminated BBQ pork, and I said \"no I'm not going to eat that since there's hair in it,\" he then gives me the dirtiest look then goes back to get the check.  He still charges me for the BBQ pork, at that time I was frustrated and upset because of the look he gave me. I asked for the manager.  He asks what's wrong n I said I need this off my bill since there was a hair in it, the server then reply to the manager with \" I already told this lady its not a hair but she doesn't believe me and ask to speak to you\" loudly in front of the whole restaurant.  Well just great now everyone in the restaurant knows how unsanitary the establishment is. ...first of all the server could have simply ask if I wanted something else or if they can send it back and have the cook remake it instead of saying, \" its not a hair\" then jus leave.  second, server did not have to loudly put the customer down saying its not his fault and that he already explained that's its not a hair, he could have talked to the manager first, back of the house, before the manager came over so that the manager is aware of the problem.  Even if it is not a hair, the potential that it is is fairly high.  A paying customers satisfaction should be top priority in the food establishment... In the end I left unhappy and will not be returning to this place.  Goodluck with your business treating customers that way and in ur way of solving problems.",

Otherwise, I definitely will be returning!",

Delicious!  The pho was hearty, just enough for a soup and sandwich combo.  Nice side veggies to dump in, some Thai basil, sliced jalapenos, bean sprouts.  I hadn't been here since the Five and Diner closed.  But I certainly will return for this one.  Terrific food!  Service could be a little better.",

I always see this place when I go to the asian grocery in the same shopping center. It looks like a diner (and being from NY that's an appeal in itself)  I had the spring rolls and the chicken pho. The Spring rolls had this little crunch to it. It seems like they put the fried  wrapper to the inside which gave it a pleasant surprise.The Pho broth was more flavorful. I'm really not a fan of too much cinnamon in my broth but if that's what you like you'll love this. To me you cant really have bad pho.. at least i haven't had any that was horrible... yet.  The place was pretty empty which kinda scared me a little but over all a good experience. I'd come here again to try other things.",

My husband still claims that it is me that is too sensitive to eggs, and not the restaurant, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  I am going to admit that I am not a huge huge fan of pho due to a flavor in the broth that I just have never gotten used to.  It's kind of like a tangy flavor that a vietnamese food newb like me cannot identify.  However, noodle soup sounded good today so I got some, and it was huge.  I could barely eat a quarter of it, with that tangy flavor I'm not crazy about preventing me from getting into the soup.  I also got a banh mi since I never had them before to try and eat later.  I ended up eating the whole thing instead of the soup, and I really liked it.  However, it was god awful small with very little meat, but nice veggies.    I would go here again for takeout (which is what I did this time) but that eggy smell will never have me go there to sit down and eat.  I would like to explore other places for more reasonably priced banh mi sandwiches as well.",

The service was good, consider they were short on staff.  Hai our server definitely was on top of everything. The greatest part is they were all Vietnamese and spoke the language. (sorry don't like walking into a Vietnamese restaurant and the people working do not speak a lick of the language).  I don't know if it was hang over food (but I wasn't hangover) or if it was because we had a long weekend of partying and lack of sleep but the food was DELISH!!!  I ordered the Vegetarian Ban Xeo (vietnamese crepes), Bun Bo Hue (Spicy beef Noodle) and tried the Pho as well as Goi Ga (Chicken Salad).. it was all very delicious....

PROS:  * 10 % discount for overall bill when you mention you were referred by Yelp!\"Whoo hoo! *Very Clean. *Great customer Service. * A variety of Vietnamese foods to choose from. * Pho Tai was good. Light broth. Pho was good (4 star.) I enjoy authentic Vietnamese food and homemade broth.  (Be careful of DARK broths. I have had some bad experiences elsewhere and believe it may be \"Instant or canned beef broth\" versus homemade or restaurant made.)  Suggestions: If ordering Pho and you like the beef. Tips on the following. I like the rare beef \"Pho Tai\" * Ask for the tai on the side \"raw/rare\" - add it in your HOT soup as soon as it is served to you. Then flip the meat under the noodles to cook the way you prefer it. Don't be intimidated by doing this. This avoids it being over cooked. I made the mistake of ordering where the kitchen has it already cooked for you and was well done beyond my preference. * Use the standard veggie garnishments: bean sprouts, mint leaves and I like to get extra lemon to squeeze in my broth.  * Condiments: Siracha (hot sauce) and Hoison sauce are added by you to your preference. A little goes a long way then, gradually add extra if needed. (These TIPS are good for Pho, especially for those who are new to eating Pho.)  My only regret is wishing I had more time to try their other items on their menu. However, I don't have that big of an appetite and I was only passing through. (Ban Xeo, Bun Bo Hue - has been highly recommended by other Yelpers, Bahn Mi (although related their french bread is not the traditional harder crisp outside, they have fresh bread.)  Enjoy! I recommend this great place. They have a lot of private parking. The thing that tripped me out was the outside decor/architect. It's a diner! But, when you walk inside it has the Vietnamese flare!",

    "text": "I give this place 1 star, but that's just my opinion. I've had my share of Pho' and so this is only from MY taste buds. We ordered spring rolls, house sandwich, and seafood pho'. My opinion in taste, is that it wasn't authentic. I prefer Pho' so 1 or Kim Long and for the sandwich I would go to Hue Thai. The bread seemed like it was just a hoagie roll rather than a French baguette. This place is only good for getting your quick fix but to be satisfied I would drive the distance to china town area.  Service was fast and friendly and gave me 10% off bill for mentioning Yelp. So i'm bumping up a star.",

    "text": "It's a 3.5 rounded up to a 4. This is an unassuming little place located on eastern avenue that looks like a 50's style diner from the outside. However, your experience inside will be anything but that.  The food is good, the service is not. Prepare for the most apathetic waiter you have ever met in your life-- I don't think this guy knows what the word smile even means. But don't let that sour your experience-- there is plenty to be had here. On a day when I was feeling really congested and stuffy, I had a terrible craving for pho which was cured by this place. Their pho is rich and flavorful and has all the typical tasty tree trimmings that come with it. I went with the rare steak and brisket combination and I was certainly not short on meat or noodles. It was considerably better than the stuff you can find at nearby Pho-saigon 8 but not quite as good as Pho-So-1 which is closer to the strip. My girlfriend choose to try the beef and noodles which came with a salad and tasty side of fish sauce  garnished with shredded carrots dipping. It was delicious and was served in authentic vietnamese style. Obviously, services is not the strong suit here but I'm a purist so I say the food makes this place worth the trip--especially if you want to expand your horizons and try some of the other vietnamese dishes out there.",

    "text": "Just okay. Located in an old 70s diner. Hubs and I came for lunch. I got the small seafood pho, he got the large beef pho. We also order the fresh spring rolls. Service was quick. We got our food right away. We got basil(a lot) when I asked for more.  Food was ok. Spring rolls were not fresh. I think they were pre made as it was pretty hard. No non msg version of the broth. In my seafood pho there were shrimp, fake crab and squid. Hubs beef pho had brisket, tendon etc.   Not bad but not mind-blowing either.",
