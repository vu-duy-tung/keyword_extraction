    "text": "Sometimes you just know it's going to be one of those days. Third trip to Metro. Last checkin was the first sit down. Took wifey with me for one of those evening out things.  Deena was our server and she was terrific. Problem was, she wasn't supposed to be our server.  She was doing the emergency cover for the person whose section we were sitting in.  Never found out who that wayward soul was. Got seated and then got forgotten. Wow! When was the last time that happened? It's been a while.    The food was top shelf as always and it was all you can eat pasta night. Happy about the food, a little salty about the service.   Once is an oops, twice is a trend. Going to give it one more shot just to check.  I'll let you know.    Should give this a one star for being forgotten. Three stars because the food was on point and Deena went the extra yard to make up for the nameless laggard who apparently forgot that if people sit in your section you might want to find out why they are there. Who knows, they could actually be customers looking to order food.",

First me and my best friend came in first and ate around 7pm we had a calzone and garlic knots and wine service and food great. My sister and brother in law had not eat dinner yet and I told them how good the food was so they asked me to join the so we all came at 915pm ready to eat more good food, the service was good and great food again but this time when we go up to leave several male employees in the bar area where fat shaming us by barking and mooing at us we looked at each other is disbelief and when we looked back they where pointing at us. Bottom line this is disrespectful and we will not be back and I have enjoyed metro pizza for over 30 plus years!",

The worse part was that they tried to hide them below some wax paper so no one would see until it was to late! We also ordered regular wings that had no sauce on them!

Hostesses were very pleasant.  There was a 15-20 minute wait so I ordered a beer at the bar.  The bartender was so rude.  No smile.  No greeting.  Nothing.  Wow... welcome to Metro Pizza.  The server was slightly better.  Somebody brought bread to our table so we asked for utensils.  5 minutes later, we asked somebody else for utensils.  We were starving so we opened the little butter packets and dipped the bread into the butter.  Lol.    5 minutes later, we got our server's attention so we asked him for utensils.  He looks over to the kitchen and says \"they're coming soon.\"  5 minutes later...  no utensils.  Server comes to take our order, and when we're done he says \"Okay I'll get your utensils.\"   Haha.    Salad comes out.  Pretty good.    Pizzas come out.  Delicious.    My son's kids Mac & Cheese hasn't come out yet....  10 minutes later....  15 minutes later.... it comes to the table cold and flavorless.    My son takes a bite and says it's terrible.  I take a bite and confirm that it's awful.    I tell our server to take it off the bill.  No sincere apology.  He agrees that he'll take off our bill.   We've been to the older Metros and they're awesome.  This location is either managed by the idiot cousin... or it's so far from the other locations that there is no quality control on service.     We won't be back.  Way too many good pizza joints in the city to waste our money here.",

When the pizza was served it was cut but NOT served onto our plates.  Usually, when we go to pizza restaurants the first piece is always served.  The food was not bad, but the service was pretty slow.  Throughout our meal dirty dishes continued to stack up on the table.  Then after we finished eating the dirty dishes remained on our table for another 20-30 mins while we waited and ate dessert.  I don't think I will return to eat there again.

    "text": "What I miss about my New York heritage is the food that I grew up with. Especially the egg plant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. Metro Pizza has reunited me with the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. The majority of the time that I dine in Metro Pizza this is what I order.     This location is the newest Metro Pizza to open in  Las Vegas. Ever since we drove back from the Spring Mountains this previous summer, I have been anticipating the opening of the restaurant.     In a way, this Metro Pizza is roadside architecture. It stands at the northeast corner of US 95 and the 215, where the spaghetti bowl of the northwest valley will probably be built. At the time that I write this, the motorist has to maneuver through a maze of roadways to access the parking lot from US 95. Once in the parking lot, you are looking at the back of the building. You have to walk around the building to get inside. When you get to the front of the building, there are two entrances. One is a take out entrance in a room that sells gelatos  and other foods. The second entrance is for dining in.    The dining room is large, and I feel nicely themed. To the right is a bar with flags of colleges hanging above. Toward the back is a mural of popular pizza families. To the back left is the open kitchen. And to the left is the take out room slash bakery. Throughout the restaurant is sufficient seating.     Before entering Metro Pizza my mind was decided on ordering the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. At a cost of around $10, it is worth the money. Especially when it includes french fries. For the most part, I was happy with the hero. I do have a tiny weenie complaint. The hero could of been warmer.    In general the service was good. Yeah, there was a wait for the food. I expected that on a Friday night. Our waitress was on top of the complimentary dinner roll refills. By the way, I ended up filling up on them. Toward the end of the meal, the waitress probably had a brain fart. This would be one of the strangest moments I experienced dining out. It was material for a Sinfeld episode. When the meal ended, my brother and I ordered coffee. A few minutes later, our waitress returns to the table. She goes up to my brother and says this is the last of the coffee and we are brewing more. I am thinking, \"Excuse me. Am I invisible? Could you have asked if one of us wanted the coffee, or let us know that more coffee was coming on the way?\" Feeling like the ghost of Metro Pizza, I sat there watching my brother sip coffee for what seemed like a good five minutes. When I returned to being a physical being again, the waitress presented me with coffee served in an Izzy cup. I was under the impression that they brewed their own coffee. They serve Izzy coffee. My taste buds regard it as decent. If I had brought it in a coffee shop I would of added a flavored syrup to it.     I will return to Metro Pizza. Their egg plant Parmesan hero is a product that keeps me coming back.  ........This is review 68 of my 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge......",

It took the waitress 10 min to \"find the silverware\" while other waiters were walking around willy nilly with hoards of silverware like they won the friggen lottery. then she brought bread and 3 plates for 4 people... I ordered garlic knot meatball sliders, when the food came out 50 min later, it came out as 2 sides of meatballs ( who the hell orders 2 sides of meatballs for an Entree?) my fathers eggplant Parmesan came out cold; like arctic cold. And that's all that came out after 50 min... they failed to realize that we did indeed order a large pizza but forgot to input the order ( which the clueless waitress admitted to eventually).. so we had 4 of us huddled around a frozen piece of eggplant Parm like cave people waiting for the meatball sliders and pizza to eventually come out.. the pizza was horribly undercooked. Yes we did bring this all to her attention by the way... we still received a full bill. No compensation. **update- after they charged our card for the full bill they decided to take care of some of it... well that took another 25 mins for her to figure out how to refund it. Let's see what I truly end up getting charged for!",

I've only had one semi bad experience where we ordered a chicken parm sandwich and it was cold. Sometimes the wait is just a little too long for the food but they make the food right then and all the other times it's piping hot.  Small pizza was enough for me to share with hubby while he ate fingers. The chicken fingers were salty to me and I didn't prefer their fries but it wasn't bad. Pizzas here are so good! I'm a ranch connoisseur and their ranch was up yo par. Their stuffed pizzas are interesting. It's like a giant calzone pizza. Salads are good, knots are good. The only thing we haven't tried are their calzones and pastas. It is a little pricey in my opinion, but if you want yummy hot pizza check it out here.",

When I presented it to the waitress, she seemed annoyed. First off, I work In the service industry, so I planned on tipping her on the total amount of the bill. She told us that she had to get manager approval for the discount coupon that I had. Screw that. She was only worried about her tip, Not knowing that I would tip in the normal amount. I'm a regular here. After tonight, no more. I use Yelp all the time but rarely post. Tonight was very frustrating.  DO NOT OFFER DISCOUNTS IF YOU DO NOT HONOR THEM. A",

Green  Valley pizza is comprised of the following toppings:  cherry  tomatoes; zucchini; black olives; onions; and mushroom.   On a busy day,  the Friday after Thanksgiving, the person taking the tel. order was patient and friendly. The delivery driver was polite. The pizza was at doorstep in about 40 minutes.

Completely disregarded our need for drink refills, brought our food out half warm. NEVER checked on us the whole time after we finally got our food- 1 item came out first then the other item came out 10 minutes later. It really sucks when the other people are eating in front of you and by the time you get your food- they are nearly done. I couldn't wait to pay the bill and get out of there. Why were we neglected you ask? Maybe Brian should stop trying to impress the sexy young waitresses and laughing with him and do his damn job- taking care of customers like me. Every time I looked for him for help-that's what he was doing- are you kidding me??? I have been going to metro Pizza for well over 25 years- when John and Sam made the pizza on Decatur. Yeah- I'm a regular. I'll never go back the sky point spot. Thanks for ruining for our family pizza nite out Brian!",

The wait staff has a way about them that is efficient and thorough. They get the job done.  I love the spaciousness of the restaurant. The decor helps promote the Italian feel.  The food was just ok for me. I've had pizza, garlic fries, salad, and canolis. I would say that it is good food, just not wow or amazing.

We order a large pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and onion well done with a side of sliced pepperoncinis - which I pay extra for. This is what arrives - an overloaded green pepper pizza so soggy that it wasn't cooked in the middle and couldn't be placed in my oven to crisp up because it just falls through the grates! This pizza was 30 bucks and by the way no pepperoncinis! I could have ordered 4 mediums from dominos, paid less and had my dinner tonight! This has happened to us in the past with Metro so we decided to chalk it up to a busy night in the restaurant, off night for the cook- whatever but now the past couple orders have mirrored tonight's.

While the dinner was fine and our waiter (who was also tending bar) was excellent our experience was ruined by the to go area of the restaurant.  My wife is the Store Manager of a national chain retail store and frequently treats her staff to lunch. On many occasions she has ordered a total of 6 pizzas to be delivered to the store the next day and it has never been an issue. Unfortunately tonight was different.  She asked the girl behind the counter for an order to be delivered tomorrow to the store but was told \"wouldn't you rather order tomorrow so it would be fresh?\". I am not sure if she thought we wanted it cooked tonight and delivered tomorrow but that was not the real problem. She went to the back to ask the Manager on Duty - Paul if they could deliver tomorrow and was told no. Since my wife has done it many times before she asked to speak with the manager. Paul came out and began to make excuses like I don't know how many delivery guys I have tomorrow, the other store may take some of my delivery guys, I already know I have one order,etc. If you already have an order than apparently you do what we were asking.  Since this is the age of reality shows, and Metro was actually on one, don't you think that customer service should be crucial to a manager's duties? Paul made an issue out of a normal request. We than left Metro without placing the order and proceeded to another pizzeria and placed the order with them, no issues and no excuses.  I doubt my wife will ever place an order with Metro again.",

    "text": "Last night decided to get pizza for a little get together so we thought Metro would be good for larger pizzas.  The people were very nice, but the pizza was not impressive AT ALL!  We ordered two pizzas and some chicken fingers, totaled $65. for a pizza costing $25, I expected a lot more flavor! Anything. Ok, we ordered the Honolulu - ham, pineapple, bacon, onion, green peppers, we asked that half the pizza had jalapeno instead of green peppers. And it was marginal. The green pepers were in chunks and dried out, the sauce blah, the bacon bits were in a nice row across the pizza so you only had a few bites, or were completely doused, depending on which piece you got.  The second pizza is what I use to judge pizza by as I always have this style. It was a large Mott Street: sausage, peppers and onions. Ok, first off this is a $27 pizza, for WHAT! That price is absurd. The crust was soft and doughy, and didn't add much flavor. The sauce was tasteless, as was the sausage. Peppers were dried out and the onions were barely there. I was extremely disappointed. Now, I'm Italian, and lived in CT where we get our sausage from the little Italian ladies down at the corner shop, and have eaten at the Wooster Street pizza joints in New Haven. This was just plain bad pizza. If this won best pizza for nine years in LAs Vegas, people here don't know what good pizza is. I'm sorry. I would much rather go to Blaze pizza and enjoy a less expensive pizza that has a tasty sauce, with a flavorful sausage. It is so bad, I don't want to eat the leftovers, but I also don't want to throw out the pizza that I paid so dearly for. What a mess! Sorry Metro, never again.",

The reason I have to give it 2 stars is for the bad customer service. When I went, there were ONLY about 3 other guests and yet service seemed to be frustratingly slow, despite there being about 4 waiters walking around.  It took quite a while for anyone to realize the hostess had seated us. When we did get seated, there was water spilled on our seats. I thought it was probably just a minor oversight, but when I looked around, there were also a lot of tables that hadn't been bussed/cleaned and had all the dishes laid out and piled up. I would not have cared, but after seeing the slow service and the many waiters, it was hard not to notice the lack of effort being put in. When we left the place, the tables were still never cleaned, despite the multiple waiters constantly walking by the tables, looking at them, and then walking away... From getting seated to getting our check, it was all slow.",

Tasted a tad too bland, but fortunately not greasy. Wanted a Ceasar salad instead of a green one, and our server said it was a $1.50 up charge. I said \"for a plate of lettuce?\", and he said it was because of the Ceasar dressing. I said no thanks. He asked what type of dressing would I like on my house salad. I said Ceasar. No up charge. Huh?? Anyway, the meatball sub was quite tasty, so was the complimentary bread and butter.",

    "text": "Haven't been to Metro in years even though it's just blocks from the house.  We remembered the food being really good. Decided last night to grab dinner there.  First thing that hit us was all the Hawaiian decor and music.  No one ever explained what was going on, but people at several other tables were going to spin a wheel for prizes so we figured it must have been a marketing promo.  The bar menu is awful.  Bud no Bud Light.  Coors Light no Coors.  Craft beers.  I ended up ordering a glass of white Sangria that came in a wine glass the size of a tea cup with ice and a slice of lemon hanging on it.  For $5.95!?  The fresh bread that came was really good but came with the single serve plastic cups of butter you get in a McDonald's breakfast tray.  We ordered calamari (which was greasy) and fried mozzarella which had so much breading and seasoning it ruined it.  My husband's meatball sub was good he said.   Unfortunately my eggplant parmesan was made with a thick layer of ricotta cheese!  Ricotta on eggplant parmesan?  No thank you.  The sauce on my pasta had separated to a big lump of tomato paste and a pool of liquid on my plate.   Took 3 bites and was done.   The service was awful and the marinara \"blah\".  It was a Friday night at 6pm in an area of town with limited dining choices. There should have been a line out the front.  Instead, half the tables were empty.  They need to get rid of the goofy marketing promos and focus on fixing the food.",

It is a little pricey but this isn't your typical take home or have delivered type of pizza.  You get what you pay for IMO.  My daughters macaroni and cheese was delicious too.

When I was in college it was pretty damn good and one of the better pizzas around, at least I thought so.  Now it's just average.  I am a fan of the nuke fries and garlic knots though.  Those withstood the post college taste test.  The pizza on the other hand is just okay.",

The teamwork was very evident as servers from other stations are constantly helping each other and paying attention to the whole restaurant instead of just their tables.  The quality of the food is very high and even though the owners were not personally walking around or even at the restaurant the customer feels like they are right there because of the family feel and the importance they have showed to detail in the overall organization of the restaurant.  It feels like one of \"those\" neighborhood secret pizza parlors but in fact they are a local chain with numerous locations.  Thank you Metro Pizza!  We will be back frequently.

Our order was nuclear fries, and 2 small pizzas.  Our friend's order was garlic knots and 2 small pizzas.  We ordered at the same time, from the same waitress.   We also ordered another round of drinks with the food.  2 beers and a wine - same beer that had been ordered for the 90 minutes we had already been there.  The beers arrived and were a different color - the waitress said they were what we ordered.  No, they also tasted different so two new one were brought to the table, they were the right color and flavor.  The waitress tells us that she put in our order correct.  Hmmm.  The nuclear fries show up -stick with pizza, not fries.  They were literally frozen fries with some cayenne dried spice sloppily sprinkled on top.  Another order of fries show up, we said we have our, waiting for garlic knots.  Our waitress brings the garlic knots and extra fry order, tells us she put in the order correct, not sure what happened.  Okay, humm.  Our friend's 2 pizzas show up.  We wait...conversation with our waitress after 20 minutes is that our pizzas should be out shortly, not sure what is taking so long because she put our orders in at the same time.  10 more minutes, the manager comes over, our pizzas are going in now, friend's pizzas are now cold because they were waiting for ours.  He was totally professional, took back their pizzas, made fresh ones so all 4 could be served together.  More beer is ordered while we wait.  Just before 10pm the 4 pizzas arrive.  Our waitress asks if everything is okay, and doesn't know what happened because she put in our order correctly.  Enough already!  Still waiting for beer now.    We all taste a slice or two of our pizzas but now it's late, we're tired (we're in our 30s so we can't stay out late like we used to) and we want to go.  Because I was so hungry and didn't get food until so late, it was all a blur and all I can really remember is how our waitress had no idea what was going on because she did everything correct.    Whatever, it is what it is.  Of course we'll go back because we purchased the 2 for 1 gift certificates they had on special last week.",

I have never had a Caesar salad made with iceberg lettuce.  We did send everything back and they brought out new items.    By the time we had our appetizers, the restaurant was emptied.  Our pizza was ready but it sat on the counter for 15 minutes before the waiter showed up and brought it over.    By the time the pizza got to us, it was luke warm.   Very disappointing.",

Maddie: Pizza  [Stockyard] was amazing, over the top and out of this world. Service was too good to be described.  Porter: How many stars for Metro Pizza? Rachel: Five [5] Porter: Why? Rachel: I had the Gothem which was Awesome, delicious and messy fun because of extra sauce that I asked for.  I have personally been to Metro Pizza three times now. Three locations too.   The East Side / UNLV location was busy after a show at The Thomas And Mack Center. Great professionalism by the staff. I had the Stockyard and friends were shocked by the serving size.  The WEST Side location reminds me of Miami Vice with its fun decor.   The Northwest location is slower business wise, but the kids love the place as you can read. The Northwest location changes decor every now and then which helps create a reason to return. As if the food wasn't cause enough.   Special thanks to my daughters, Maddie and Rachel for helping create this review.",

It does not matter if you call in an order for pickup or delivery, or if you come inside to sit down the service is bad and takes forever. I recently brought family from out of town here for dinner on a Wednesday Evening, and it literally took 3.5 people (3 adults, 1 child) over 2 hours to receive their food, and we honestly didn't even order anything crazy. It took us 45 minutes just to get some water and we never even received the beers we had ordered from the bar. You should have seen how long it took for someone just to even acknowledge that fact that we were standing at the front desk BEFORE we sat down... I have always loved Metro Pizza for years in this town, however the Skypointe location has by far the worst customer service and the longest wait times. I have honestly not been back since our last horrible experience with family in town at the end of December, which is sad because Metro Pizza is closer to my house than literally any other business or restaurant.",

    "text": "This was my first visit. I parked in the front (so I thought) but it was actually the back. I think that this signage must be weird. The area I parked was for a business in the same building but it was closed. I walked around the building to the \"front\" and found the door labeled \"metro pizza pick-up only\". I was confused! I stood there (looking dumb) and a man walked up. He explained the ACTUAL entrance was around the corner but that I could cut through the \"pick-up only\" area to reach the full-service restaurant. How utterly confusing! I think that they need a lot better signage!  I was joining a geocaching group for a meet & greet so I found a table with 2 people (the entire group encompassed about 8 tables). The people at my table had finished eating already and their dirty plates were sitting at the end of the table (ready to be picked up by staff). No one brought me a menu so I went to an adjacent table where there were extra. A waitperson came and took my order and picked up one of the pile of dirty dishes (1 of 2). The calzone came out and the lady started to walk away. I flagged her down and asked for silverware.  I had the CHICKEN HERB CALZONE and it was very good. I enjoyed everything about it! On the down-side, I felt the accompanying marinara sauce was watery and bland.  Additional comments: Pro: pleasant atmosphere, good for groups, reasonably priced, good portion sizes, tasty food. Neutral: customer service was a little sketchy but I get the feeling that it was b/c it was a group event with people arriving at different times. Con: the second pile of dishes never got cleared even though waitstaff walked past our table repeatedly. Finally, I was never served bread even though some tables had 2 plates of bread. I didn't request any b/c I knew the calzone would be adequate but they really should have provided the bread since EVERYONE else was given it.  I recommend this place even though I only gave it 3 stars (\"a-ok\").",

Tonight i brought my family, a party of 6 and Ed was our server and he was fantastic on totally on it. Nobody in my party had ever been here before and its fair to say they are serious pizza lovers ( or snobs, take your pick! ) We ordered a 89th street Sicilian which is perfection. A nice light fluffy bready pizza with melted cheese, pepperoni, and its probably the best pizza i ever had. I literally have to exercise restraint and not overstuff myself. The other pizza was a thin crust pepperoni & cheese. As you can imagine, i was really anxious to know thier thoughts. The vote was unanimous... the best pizza hands down! That means more miles on the odometer but its totally worth it. Thanks again Ed for making our experience a great one!",

A bit pricey on the menu, for my cheap bastard standards, I waited for a sale.  yep - it was a dream come True:  They support homeless water drives, and had a 12\" cheese pizza in exchange for a 24pk of bottled water.    Albertsons had a coupon for 1.99 24pk of bottle water, so I dropped off three packs - got three cheese pizzas that barely made it out and into my truck I chomped them down.   As it was for the month, I probably had a dozen pizzas, supporting the water drive.    Buuut, my veteran monthly group opted to eat there, and so I was able to try the menu.  NY style pizza - avoid it.  LOTS of bread, not much sauce.   Stick with the standards - meat lovers, pepperoni, etc.    Always good service, but I miss the 2-4-1 slice or 2-4-1 large pizza specials that Koval has.",

Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal! If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation.  My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries! My experience with Metro is solely based on take out.

    "text": "We went on a busy Friday night. Even though I was told a 30 minute wait, 15 minutes passed before my family of 4 were seated, which was nice. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, it is really family friendly. If you planned on having a quiet dinner, this place is not for you. The restaurant is in an open area, so having a conversation means you have to raise your voice a few decibels to be heard. The ovens are in the same area too, so you get the delicious smells from the food, but also the chatter that is going on. They have kid options for food as well as family portions. My son had a mini cheese pizza to himself and my daughter had Mac and cheese, which was surprisingly good. My wife and I split a large specialty pizza, the \"Memphis\". It was a barbecue chicken pizza, which was delicious. Even the crust was good. We are a \"ranch with pizza\" kind of family, and we judge the ranches restaurants serve strictly, but the ranch they gave us was delicious also. The only complaint I have is that the prices are kind of high. Most pizzas are fairly priced, $15 - $20ish for regular pizzas but the specialty pizza was $29! Good lord! Even though I loved the pizza, I probably won't get a specialty pizza again based off the price. To conclude, come here if you are looking for a local family friendly restaurant that serves good pizza. I will definitely bring my family and visiting family here again.",

Get home NOT extra cheese! Call and they are so rude! Solution come back in 10 minutes and we will give you a new one. Honestly they should have deliver at no charge!

    "text": "Wow...these guys really built one classy pizza joint out in the northwest boonies! And I mean CLASSY.  Beautiful free-standing building.  Inside spacious, bright, with large tables and comfortable booths. A large, inviting looking bar took up most of one wall, and the open tile kitchen with the visible ovens is another touch of class.    To call this place a pizza joint isn't really accurate because they have a fairly extensive menu.  But of couse, it all comes down to the food and service.  The day I was there, both were very good. My wife and I ordered a house salad and large saugage pizza. I'm a pizza minimalist...to me a pizza is New York style, topped with sausage or pepperoni, plenty of cheese and sauce, and thin and chewey crust.  And that's what I got.  Its almost as good as the pizza in Metro's Decateur location, though it was slightly sweeter and less spicy.  I'm sure it'll all even out in time.  Service was fine even though our server announced he was \"In training\". All in all, a delightful dining experience and I'm sure they'll be seeing more of me.",

She is a wonderful waitress, attentive, funny, helpful - she certainly should be working somewhere else.  She is way over qualified and too professional for this place!  We liked the pizza when it first opened and therefore kept coming back.  But in the last 3 months it has just gotten to be terrible... portion sizes have gotten smaller... food quality is virtually non-existent and the only thing consistent about this place is that it is inconsistent.  Our bread came to the table raw inside... all 4 loaves... I mean, come on people, this is a pizza place with a bakery next door.  You should know how to cook bread!  French fries were soggy. And the pizza - barely edible.  Now, I have to tell you, we order NY thin crust cheese pizza.  If you load your pizza with a bunch of meat/veggies, you probably won't notice a change.  But we did... sauce was tasteless!  I had to request garlic and oregano and still it tasted like dishwater on bread.  The response?  Well, it must be a new cook. Hmmm.... bad answer from the kitchen.  Manager never bothered to come over to the table to address the issue.  Next day - two people in our party had the gurgly stomachs, etc....  It's too bad - the place has a nice feel - well decorated and good location.  But that doesn't make up at all for the lousy food and lack of concern from the owner/manager.  Restaurants don't run themselves....    Fortunately they aren't the only place in town - in a city this big with the vast array of options the owners should care.  But it's evident they do not.  Just like a former reviewer said, they change things and do not notify people and they just don't care about their customers.  Spend your $$ someplace else.",

And it's quite the haul to our house so the pizza was always somewhat cold. We didn't mind though. The pizza was always perfect. When they opened the sky pointe store we were very excited because we would have hot pizza. The last several weeks, however, the pizza  has been awful. The sauce seems watered down, the outer crust is so flaky it crumbles with every bite and the center of the pizza has been soggy.  Another wonderful pizza place trying to be a chain and seems to be failing.",

Crust was toasted correctly but lacked significant flavor. Sauce was just \"OK\" but lacked presence and there was too much sauce to the point the cheese was falling away from crust when folded like good N.Y pizza should be.. Lots of good cheese that tasted \"OK\". Lots of pepperoni that was \"OK\". We ordered the FRESH GARLIC AND PEPPERONI N.Y style, thin crust. The \"FRESH GARLIC\" was a joke... just like the  Metro Pizza location on Decatur and Flamingo served us some 6 months or so ago...... Then we got the bill..... $28 for a large pizza with pepperoni and fresh garlic........ NOW THAT'S A JOKE! Also...... N.Y pizza should be delivered on aluminum pie trays, not some plastic POS tray. I will say that my friends meatball pizza looked very good..... looked like real meatball slices. Once again I regretted not going to New York Pizza and Pasta..... It's only location is at North East corner of Sahara and Jones. BRIAN MAKES THE BEST NEW YORK THIN CRUST FRESH GARLIC,PEPPERONI PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS, Wednesday thru Saturdays.....do not confuse this place with \"MARK RICH'S NEW YORK PIZZA AND PASTA\" which is IMHO not good pizza and has 2 locations in LV.",

I had booked the party through the catering manager.  The manager never came over to see how the refired food was or how our party was going. I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years. As a manager I always touched every table to make sure things were good and made a point of checking back several times on tables that had problems. The manager never checked to see how things were nor did the catering manager check back to see how things were. I guess spending $200 at a pizza place doesn't rate a call or followup. I will never go back. We tried to fix the pizza at home and we couldn't get the dough cooked. The server was great and tried to flux the problem, but the management, kitchen and catering staff failed. I will never recommend metro pizza and have told my friends who are also in the business about my experience and they won't go either. I like little small places but not this one. Way over priced  and the food was horrible. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! We should have gone to Rosati's, its much better.",

There was no one at the hostess desk....we stood for a minute or so and a waiter, who we later learned was named Ernest asked if we'd been helped.  He finished with his table, grabbed some menus and took us to a booth.  He said he'd be back with silverware.  Sure enough, he came rushing by and gave us the silverware and said he might as well take our order since he was there.  Great.....at least he is paying attention to us.  Next server to come by asks if we need drinks/order and we tell her we've been taken care of.  We ask who is the guy helping us and this is when we learn his name is Ernest.  She asks if something is wrong....saying she is one of the managers....We told her that if it weren't for Ernest, we'd still be standing by the hostess stand, that no one was there, and he took it upon himself to take care of us.  She then starts to give excuses as to why no one is around to help....a couple of large groups, needed to set up.........don't care.....You don't leave the floor empty to cater to a couple of groups and you certainly don't give that as an excuse.  Food was good....and if it weren't for Ernest, we might not return to this location.  Looking at our receipt, I see the server who got credit for waiting on us was NOT Ernest, but Jen J......I certainly hope they pool tips, because Ernest deserved the tip more than Jen.",

Normally going in the first week a place is open you kind of have to expect slow service as they work out the kinks and get in a rhythm. This was definitely not the case here. The hostess was very nice and seated us within the wait she quoted. I can't say enough about our waitress, I wish I had gotten her name but she was amazing from start to finish! The pizzas and salads came out and they were cooked perfectly. We ordered a white pizza and a pepperoni. We will definitely be back very soon as this is only a 5 minute drive from our house.",

We ordered a \"meat\" pizza also... very bland. No flavor at all. The tea tasted like it was sitting too long. As for the restaurant itself, that was very clean and our waitress was really good.

I know it wasn't metro's fault but we were parked in their handicap parking {we're both handicapped and hung our sign up} trouble with this metro  their parking lot is way off to the side and far from the restaurants entrance so yeah makes easy target to vandalize patrons cars.called police filed complaint and talked to metro's manager on duty.advised him to maybe put camera out in parking lot and for him to call police so they can watch parking lot when cruising the area. told me he will have owner give me a call. of course that never happened! yesterday evening ended up making this the most expensive pizza we ever had.typical owner could give a damn about trouble we had outside his restaurant!!! we will never set foot in metro pizza ever again.just a warning to all the public be wary of eating in this establishment cause your vehicles will be at risk when you park in metro's parking lot.",

So fresh bread is served at the table and it is easy but don't fill up. We ordered two order of the garlic knots since they are 6 per order and we had 9 people. Tasty and huge and why does this place have the best ranch I've ever tasted?!? Omg!!! We ordered the Honolulu, the Pantheon, and the Meat Lovers (large). Seriously, the crust is not thick or thin, it's just right! The flavor of the dough was amazing! I've eaten so many pizzas in my life and this is the BEST!!! I loved the Pantheon because it had a garlic cream sauce and the thick mozzarella cheese and feta and spinach with the chicken on top literally make you just want to melt into it! I sadly could only eat one piece because it is so filling but I tasted the toppings on the other pizzas and they are huge pieces of everything. The waitress told me it's because they use all real and fresh ingredients. I'm craving this pizza again!! I know pizza is so fatty but I need it again soon!!! This is my new pizza spot. Now I hope they deliver to my house because this is my UFC and Oscar night must have! Though each large pizza is about $29 each, big and filling and the taste makes it so worth it!",

Most bartenders are not very friendly and keep to themselves. The bar is never busy but the restaurant and especially the takeout do get very busy. Only once had I got a burnt pizza, once they forgot to make my order, and today I was put on hold when ordering for 14:12 with no apology from Jennifer but typically the pizza is excellent.

    "text": "I was very excited to try metro pizza as I had heard great things. I viewed their menu and saw they offered a stuffed pizza. Being from Chicago, Giordano's stuffed pizza is literally my absolute favorite pizza. When I called I asked if the pizza was similar to the stuffed pizza from Chicago, the person answered that they actually have a \"Chicago\" stuffed pizza (I did see it listed on the menu and it was a spinach stuffed pizza) not answering the real question of what the pizza was like...so I figured she had never had the real deal and I would go for it.  I asked about the sizes, it was to feed two of us, and she said well the small Only has 4 pieces. 4 pieces sounded so small and we unfortunately opted for the large. I definitely should have realized a large stuffed pizza is very very big BUT it was early in the day and I was hung over so I though leftovers wouldn't be the worse thing. Unfortunately if you are looking for a Chicago style stuffed pizza (giordanos, Lou malnattis, unos...) this is not the same. We ordered a cheese and there is a definite crust completely covering the cheese with all of the marinara on the side. A True stuffed pizza does indeed have a very very thin crust topping the luscious cheese in the middle But the marinara costs the top and is baked with the pizza. The crust is deep and crispy and I always use it as a breadstick. This crust was much more reminiscent of a typical deep dish pizza and didn't have the crispy texture or thickness. Super super super disappointed and unfortunately the rest of the pizza went to waste after the first 2 slices.   Seems like I probably ordered the wrong type of pizza and my expectations of a Chicago stuffed pizza were out of line with reality. Now that a giordanos exists on the strip in Bally's if I am to spend $30+ dollars on a pizza I've learned a valuable lesson of where to order.",

The dough to me makes or breaks a pizza and this dough is perfection!  Food is amazing but service is lacking.  The hostess was so unfriendly and seemed unhappy with everyone walking in.  The servers always seemed too busy to refill drinks and are always look frazzled.  When you need something they may not be found but then you see them run by frantically 15 minutes later.  We rarely tip less than 20% because my husband and I have both been servers and we get it but we had so little interaction with our grumpy server that we actually tipped him less.  We may come back for take out next time.",

Tony was our server and I couldn't have asked for anyone better! He told us all about the restaurant and the menu.  They give you this amazing bread at the beginning which the pizza crust is made of. Then we ordered Garlic Romano Fries as our app. For our entree we had Italian sausage spaghetti and a large Abbondanza pizza with garlic. AMAZING!  Not to mention our drinks stayed filled the whole time. Tony was so awesome and talked history of the place and we talked hockey forever. Such a cool guy with local knowledge. I'll definitely be back for the great food and best service.",

I showed up at 5:45pm and paid. They told me about 2 more minutes. 15 minutes later I asked where my food was. The girl went back to check and came back with my food. It took 40 minutes for 1 sub sandwich. Very frustrating! Not to mention the food was also disappointing. The chicken on the sub was over cooked and barely any sauce on the sandwich making it very dry. The bread wasn't very fresh either. And the girls at the pick up counter were not very friendly.  Needless to say I don't need to rush back there any time soon.",

Luckily they weren't busy at all when we stopped in. My husband got a small stockyard stuffed pizza and he said it was great and the sausage was very flavorful. I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was pretty good as well. We also shared the chocolate cake and couldn't even finish it. That's definitely a family size dessert! Our drinks were never empty and the restaurant was kept very clean. I don't know why we hadn't been to Metro Pizza before last night, but we'll definitely be back!",

They have always arrived with the center of the pizza being completely soggy, as if it was undone completely (doughy). But it is the method for which the pizza is placed in the box and steam to death I guess. Out of all the pizzas I have ordered all over this country, this was a new one for me. I had spoke with a manager (Chris) there before and he was rude as all can be about it and very challenging. As a customer, if I pay you good money for quality and you fall short, then stand behind your product and make things right the next time. Leave out the confrontation or ridiculous compromises. Do as you say, deliver as you promise.   I don't think I will keep my business with Metro going forward. Too many pizza options in Vegas to deal with bad attitudes.",

Well we ordered some sausage overload pizza OMG soooooo good..   Next our waitress.. After asking three times for plates I finally got up and stole it from a table. Not to mention her lack of personality and poor attitude.   The food... Calamari came with two different sauces no one would've guessed that if I hadn't said something. Aren't you supposed to explain to a guest what you're dropping off at the table?! My parents ordered a meat lovers pizza with thin crust... Except they brought a Hawaiian that wasn't even close to thin and the waitress argued that was the thinnest even though mine was incredibly thin. Waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for the new pizza and SHOCKER they rushed it so hard that it was undercooked and doughy. Waitress continues to argue with us and it takes a manager a good 10 minutes to come to our table to resolve this.  Long story short.. The pizza was taken off, the waitress forgot about a box for the pizza after asking multiple times and got herself a well earned tip.",

Ordered the Eggplant Parma and salads with garlic knots. The eggplant was cold???  So were the garlic knots???  Asked for a manager and was told he was busy and if we waited he might find time to talk to us.  When we tried to find our waiter, hardly ever came by the table, to let him know of the issues, we had to grab a bus boy to go find him. Told waiter to box it up so we could go home and microwave it.  Our water glass remained empty as well. Sad day for Italian.  Ok, things got a little better,  as we were leaving I saw a man whom I believed was a manager. I asked him and he was.  I relayed my above review and he was surprised that staff told me he was to busy. He wanted to refund my check and I told him I just wanted him to know.  It was frustrating to have poor service but at least I felt he cared!  We give them another chance and post the outcome.",

The last three times we have been Chris was our waiter and no offense this guys sucks at his job. Horrible waiter. I got an app before my water came. He kept standing at the computer for over 15 min every time and couldn't take more than one order at a time. I went over to him and asked if he could come and take some orders and the family next to us literally had nothing and seemed upset so I told him to take their order first. After he took their order he took off and I said where are you going and he started to argue with me that he can't take more than one order at a time. I asked for a manager and simply said the waiter seemed overwhelmed and I just wanted to place an order but that it would be best if Chris didn't return to our table if possible. Ed was very nice and took the order. Other than this one waiter, this place is awesome. I honestly don't want anything for free or any special treatment, just want the order taken. I'll definitely return for sure and hope the service gets better.",

We had to constantly flag down our waitress for everything. Then comes the check I handed the waitress our card with out looking at the bill big mistake, when i went to sign I noticed the bill was not ours, informed the waitress who took the bill went to the back them came back let us know we had paid less so she would run our card for the remainder.

The sauce at Metro is simply put, excellent, authentic Italian. We love Metro and will continue patronize often. The delivery unless fixed, probably not so much.

The pizza and house salad are the favorites for us. Both are large enough to share among a few people.  They have several promotions going on daily to save money which is always a plus. When we were there it was Disney weekend. If you had on Disney attire or dressed as a character, you received 25% off your bill. You can also get a free spin on the wheel of prizes for every large pizza you order. We didn't win anything there, but the kids thought it was fun. Would definitely recommend going to Metro Pizza.",

Metro Pizza always has amazing service I am rating this in regards to my take out order on 05/25/18 we ordered a pizza with a few salads along with wings and the garlic fries!  It was about a 30 minute wait or so for all the food to be completed and avalible for pickup. After the time had passed we went to go pickup the food and the cashier at the register was polite and very nice handed my food in exchange for my money and I then proceeded to head back home. I didn't even think to check and make sure the order was correct as I assumed they would get it on the first try.   After arriving at home we started to go through all the items and noticed that the garlic fries were not inside the bag. I then immediately called the business and let  Them now that they forgot the garlic fries at which time she asked me if it's with the wings I looked in the Box of wings and could not locate any garlic fries. I then let me know the were not and I'll be back enroute to pick them up.  I went back grabbed the fries as they were made fresh and she advised me that when she talked with the cook he didn't see them on the list although they were and she was sorry for that.  I let her know that it was ok and I picked up my items and left.   The parking situation where I was at was pretty small although it does look like there is extra parking nearby the restaurant itself appeared clean and the employees are really  polite and nice!",

    "text": "Voted Best Pizza in Las Vegas by the Review Journal 9 times and I can see why.  They have all well know regional styles of pizza, like NY, Chicago deep dish, along with other great food offerings.   We had the Pantheon, a white garlic cream sauce pizza topped with spinach, artichokes, and grilled chicken. The thin crispy crust was delicious with this ingredient combo. We also had the Triple play, and thin crust triple portion of sausage pizza cut into squares. Yummo!  Sausage could have had more of a spicy kick but I guess that's why they make crushed red pepper.  From the pizzas I've tried here, they are one of the best in the valley. They always have great specials on a monthly calander the prepare in the restaurant. They change the theme of restaurant weekly, daily and monthly which adds some fun to the dining experience.  Check the back of your Smith's grocery store receipts for 25% off your dine in check over $25. Deals can be had here if you are a smart consumer.   ENJOY!",

It was a slow Sunday night when I walked in and everything seemed disorganized from the hostess to the wait staff, although my order and tab was correct. I sat down and placed a beer order, then waited, received the beer and proceeded to order food: meatball sliders. Then I sat around for 10-15 min just playing on my phone, starving and wondering why they hadn't brought over a bread basket. Eventually the bread arrived before I asked about it, but I barely had a couple bites when my food arrived. The sliders were good overall but the buns seemed over toasted and were super hard. 1 of the top buns even looked charred and burnt...this is not how I remember it from previous experience. The buns were so hard that I had to be very careful eating it, worrying that my teeth or brackets would bust off trying to finish my meal. I'm hoping it was just an off night here because I used to be a big fan of Metro. Maybe next time I'll stick with the pizza.",

I went once for their one slice for charity and didn't like it, but I thought I would give them another try, for reals this time.  I wasn't surprised by the still mediocre food give to us. First off, the cheapest large pizza this place has is 17$. That's just for a cheese pizza, and it goes up to nearly 30$ for specialty ones. Luckily we came here during their half off time- which is nearly everyday at a certain time. It should be a warning when a place has  half off their food nearly everyday;  it is ridiculous to pay full price for this food.  It's very bland, in my opinion. The sauce tastes like glorified ketchup, and the cheese is tasteless. The garlic knots were only good because of the cheesy powder they are covered with, but again, the sauce that comes with them is not very good. I hear a lot about the crust, but I don't see what people crave about it.   Service was alright, there were only a few tables occupied (which is strange since this place is so big and SO popular) and we waited a long time to be seated and served.   Overall this place is ok, if you pay half price (8$) for their cheapest pie, but other than that, you won't see me here.",

(why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce.   I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.  The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo).   I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic.   For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden.",

It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off, so some friends and I decided to have lunch here. We ordered a large salad and a large pizza, half Honolulu and half Sunspot. They also brought warm bread and butter to the table. It was more than enough food for 3 people. The pizza was good, but sadly it was a little watery and soggy. The Honolulu comes with ham, pineapple, bacon and green pepper, and the Sunspot had chicken, artichoke, tomatoes, basil and garlic. You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done. Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery. I enjoyed the pizza, but it's not the best I have ever had, and the only time I would probably come back here is for happy hour.",

    "text": "I have been going to Metro Pizza since I was a wee young foodie, and I have always loved the food and the service.  There is no question why their pizza wins Best of Las Vegas  nearly every year.  Having said that, the family and I went to try the newest edition located in the northwest off the 95 between the 215 exit and Durango.  The experience was less than stellar overall.    The ambiance and the appearance of the new Metro is wonderful.  It is very open and inviting, and the seating is well spaced.  The decor is great, with a mix of old-world Italy and sports banners hanging in the bar area.  After being seated, we were greeted in a fairly good amount of time (within about 5 minutes) and the server started out on point.  That is where the point became a jagged line.  After our drink orders were in, we asked for a kid's cup for our son, and never saw it (after asking two additional times for it).  The lack of attention continued for us throughout the meal.  I did run to the restroom to verify that I was, in fact, still visible to the human eye just in case there was an anomaly, but alas I was not transparent.  The orders were finally taken and the food did arrive to the table in a more than reasonable timeframe.   The food is still exceptional, and even though this is a new location the quality is still very much the same as I would expect from Metro.  The service, on the other hand, continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate.  After receiving our food.  We did not see our server again until nearly 20 minutes later.  We had to ask another server for a refill of our beverages, and there was never a follow-up from our server until that 20 minute mark.  When she did finally show up, my wife asked for to-go containers and a slice of their carrot cake for our son.  The boxes did show up, but we never saw the carrot cake, or even the check for that matter!  20 more minutes passed and the server was seen checking on other tables and completely ignored us.    This was the final straw.  We called the manager over to express our frustration and concern over the missing cake that our son was now asking every 3 seconds for (never keep a 5-year-old away from his dessert).  The manager was very courteous and did state that he had noticed the poor service (which is the first concern I have.  If he is aware of the poor service, why wasn't he out there to begin with?) and wanted to make sure that we were taken care of.  This was a very disappointing trip and one that I will have to think hard about returning to this location for.   This restaurant's only saving grace is the food is fantastic and well worth a normal wait.  I hope that they are able to correct their poor service issues.",

The first time my Mom and I went was awful which was about around the time when the sky pointe location first opened. We had a lot of questions about the food and our server knew nothing about the menu. We ordered a pizza that was nothing as she described. It was really nasty. We took one bite and sent it back. The Manager refused to take it off of our bill even though we sent it back. The service sucked that day and they weren't even busy. We decided we were never coming back.                                              Well, yesterday on July 4th after going to a movie with my Mom and Son and getting ready to pass Metro Pizza on the way home, we started talking about giving them a second chance. We were seated right away with a very friendly young lady. Our server was Scotty. We asked a lot of questions about the menu and he answered every one of them. He knows the menu. We decided on the Lg. Gotham Pizza. It was fabulous. Scotty said it was one of their popular pizza's. Everything had a perfect balance. The al dente red peppers to the cooked fresh mushrooms to the just right sauce and perfect meat combo was so good.  Scotty is an asset to your company and we will definitely be coming back. I would also like to say that yes the food is pricey but they have specials throughout every month which if you go on those days then it is affordable to go a little more often as most other pizza places have coupons too to accommodate their prices too.",

I was so hungry and too pissed to go back when I got home. Extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location.",

She started be wanting to sit us next to a group of 20 right next to the small kids side of the group. I asked to sit elsewhere as the place was not busy. The next group of 2 she did seat next to the kids, they looked upset. Next pizza was coming out to tables that were after us and the group of 20 even got their food after several groups that came in well after them. We just sat and watched how everyone was working. This location compared to the Tropicana and Henderson location needs some serious help. If you like Metro Pizza as we do stay away from the centennial location, go to the other locations.",

I'm gonna try this place one more time and try other items on the menu... Maybe I'm missing something, after all they did win best of Las Vegas for a reason.",

We each paid around $15.00 with tip. The waitress took at least 20 minutes to bring us our check. The next day I checked my back account and noticed I was charged twice two different amounts. I called and spoke with Chris(manager) who told me it might have been because the waitress pressed the wrong number and tried to cancel the transaction and it should be reversed by Friday. I called Friday to tell him the charge was not reversed. He looked into it and told me the waitress charged we wrong because she forgot to take off the free cannoli for our birthday.  So she charged my card again after removing the the cannoli.  Before I could get my money back j had to prove to him that my friend paid(thanks corporate), which she did.  So after a week in a half since my original visit I finally got my money back.   Chris did a wonderful job handling this situation. He stayed in contact with me for every step and was sincerely apologetic. He's the only reason this store didn't get one star.",

But really for the quality they should be. I'm having trouble figuring out if they deliver. If they did, I would be in more trouble. We have tried a variety of items- fried mozzarella appetizer, yummy but crunchy, the marinara is great with it. We tried the seafood Fra Diavolo pizza- also awesome but not the best for reheating because the calamari gets a little weird. My kids have destroyed the kids menu options and they are happy with them. We had the Old New York and the Spring Street as well. Man the sausage on the pizza is killer! My one disappointment would be the cannoli. A little more delicate, larger and with more filling and I could really wreck myself!",

It's very close to my house and the kids really like it so I've been here a few times. We ordered the ravioli on our most recent visit and good googly moogly it was HUGE. The whole plate was one giant ravioli, not several individual ones. The marinara sauce isn't overly acidic or bold. It's actually a very mild understated sauce, which i like. The ravioli had very thin delicate pasta surrounding the ricotta cheese middle and it worked wonderfully with the sauce. I've had the stuffed cheese pizza with sauce served in the side and that's delicious as well. The gelatto is creamy perfection, coming in flavors like salted caramel and banana with chocolate chip. My only disappointment was the garlic rolls. They are too much dry dough, not enough butter and garlic. Plus they're too big for the butter to penetrate. They're dry and not as good as the complimentary bread served when you sit down.",

Decent pizza, $20 for a large thin crust pepperoni at a local neighborhood is on the extreme high side of prices so I only go about once per month, otherwise I'd be there 2-3 times per week ordering. Free bread at the table while you wait and crayons for the kids is great to keep everyone calm. Chicken fingers with fries are pricey, but cooked to perfection. I've ordered these several times with my pizzas and every time they serve them, they fail over and over again at bringing ketchup. Even when you ask the server you'll be usually having to ask a second time because they forgot. What's the deal with not bringing the $2 bottle of ketchup with the fries or include it in a small cup in the basket?. They act like it's fine bottle of wine and don't want you to have it. Also AVOID sitting at the booths near the bar, otherwise you get little to no service because the bartender that makes all the drinks for the whole place also has to wait on you.",

We only got to glimpse the inside of the restaurant while we waited a few moments to get our order and pay.  It was large and spacious, kid friendly, and full of warm-colored Italian decor.  It looked very welcoming and I wouldn't mind if we ended up eating here some time.    The food was pretty tasty.  I split the Tuscan salad and the Milano pizza with a friend.  The pizza was pretty good, although I imagine it would taste better if it was straight out of the oven and not reheated by the time we got home.  The salad was also good.  I'm knocking off a few stars because they messed up quite a few parts of our order.  We ordered bleu cheese on the side for a number of our salads and they didn't get that right.  And I remember my friend stating that twice while ordering on the phone.  They also handed me a box covered in what I will assume was chocolate frosting.  Just a bit weird.  Then they gave me the weirdest looks when I asked for a napkin to wipe it off my hands.    They also have gelato here and we got the stracciatella to go.  Delicious!",

    "text": "I come here often with a work colleague for lunch. Its pretty chill with a low amount of people that come in the restaurant during lunch. The parking is spacious. The restaurant is not located in the easiest location to get to. Its a few blocks from the 215 and located in pretty much a residential area. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. The service is a little lacking during lunch, hence my 3 star review. My colleague and I waited a long time to get served drinks and food. We ended up waiting a good 15 minutes after our check was provided and ended up paying cash since I had a work meeting to go to. The waiter never showed up within those 15 minutes. The food is good. I typically get a milano pizza. Super scrumptious!",

The pizza was so flavorful and you can tell the ingredients are fresh we will definitely be back! Also Lynn's service was AMAZING! 5 stars!",

We loved the complimentary bread, it's as addictive as ever, and our 3 salads were more than enough for everyone... in fact, we boxed one for leftovers.  We got 2 large pizzas, the Gotham and the Hawaiian, and still had 3 pieces left at the end. The pizzas were excellent, even the leftovers.  Hint: if you have an air fryer, try reheating a slice at 350 for 5 minutes. It comes out almost as good as new!  Despite the large amount of pizza restaurants in Las Vegas, few are actually excellent. Metro Pizza is one of the rare few.",

As soon as Tiffany put our pizza down we knew it was going to be good. It had that oooey gooey oily cheesy look to it like a nice Greek place back east. We were not disappointed. The crust is very good and holds up the sauce and topping. Wasn't flopping all around. tasted just like a pizza from back east. We ordered the large cheese with extra cheese and I plowed through half the pizza in no time. We also ordered a Stromboli and it was just ok. Kind of soggy, and many bites all I got was ham. We also got a small loaf of bread before the food and it was really good. Service good, pizza great, Stromboli meh.",

My friend also got their lunch special with garlic fries and chicken parm sliders which was very tasty. I think I will order that next time.   Every time I order take out I get the spring street which is my absolute favorite. I prefer a crispier crust so I always ask for it to be over-baked which they gladly do.   I'm very happy I decided to give them another try. It's delicious and has actually become one of my favorite pizza places. The service is much better and their to go order people are awesome!",

While everyone was nice, no one was particularly personable or super friendly.  A regular cheese pizza after tax was just under 19.00, it was decent but nothing special.  I was wishing I had gone to Verrazanos . I probably will give metro another try but only because I have loved them for so long so it's hard to break up. I would not order a cheese pizza again as it's overpriced. Sorry metro but if you don't step it up I'm gonna hafta dump you.",

The Caesar salad looked unhealthy.  Our server Taylor was really amazing but I don't think will come back here again.  Not sure if it's under new management but you should take a note from the original owners and you have the recipe for customer service and the sea body to make a really amazing place is just not like that here anymore.",

She was nice but the service was really slow for a night not that busy. Food took a while to come out about 30 minutes after we had ordered. Bread was cold too. Don't know why food took so long if there were at least 4 servers standing around talking, not doing their job. Food probably sat up there and servers were too busy chit chatting instead of taking the food out. Why have so many servers working at the same time if the food isn't being taken to the tables and you can CLEARLY see them standing around just talking. Management needs to do something about this. Food was ok but so not worth coming back for slow service and subpar pizza. We've came in several times and have been seated with Lynn and the service she gives is OUSTANDING but don't think she was working that night.",

To summarize: 35 minutes to get our appetizer (calamari and chicken wings), 1 hour (for pizza) and 1 hour 10 minutes (for a kids macaroni and cheese).

It really is like eating two pizzas. Plus, the bread you receive before your pizza is to die for!  The joint is always very clean with kind and intelligent employees and is nicely decorated on the inside. They offer takeout and delivery and have a gelato case.  Tips:  -- Between 2 and 4 PM Monday through Thursday, pizzas are half price for dine-in customers. We always order a large and take the rest home. Slices freeze well when wrapped individually in saran wrap.  -- At 7 AM on Black Friday, the store opens to sell gift cards at 50% off. There is always a long line so be sure to arrive early. Each person can buy up to $250 in gift cards (an $800 value). When they sell out, they sell out and the rest of the line goes home disappointed.   So, if you get the 50% off gift cards and go between two and four Tuesday through Thursday, you're getting a gigantic pizza at only 25% of the price.",

I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce; the spaghetti came with marinara (no meat) and was so bland I felt like I was back to eating the Chef Boyardee of my childhood. I didn't send it back because it took a while for the food to arrive and I didn't feel like waiting for something else. A good portion of the plate was left and definitely wasn't worth taking home for leftovers. When the bill came, I saw I was charged extra for meat sauce. I pointed this out to the server, who told me that's how much the meat sauce costs. When I informed him that I was served marinara, he told me that I did get meat sauce - that's just how their meat sauce comes. Uh, with no meat?  He fixed the bill, but was still saying that their marinara is very runny and my sauce was chunky. AGAIN, I reiterated that there was NO MEAT in the sauce. So, bland food and mediocre service.  I gave it an extra star because my husband's cheesesteak sandwich was all right - at least, better than the spaghetti.",

If you can't make it right, don't make it at all. Wouldn't take that much effort to make it so much better. The main event, pizza, was much better. Good crust, not thick, but not too thin either. Very good sauce and generous toppings. I still like Rosati's better, but Metro's was good enough to visit again.",

This location has had service issues from the get go. I kept hoping it would improve but no luck.  Took my wife and son for dinner this week and as usual my son ordered a chocolate shake. We noticed he wasn't drinking it and we asked why. He said it wasn't the same as always.  Upon tasting it it was odd tasting and had dark chocolate chips in it. We asked the waiter and he said they were out of ice cream and used gelato instead.  We voiced our displeasure and he said sorry but didn't offer a refund or substitute item.  How about having some integrity and letting us know you are out of ice cream when we ordered it. Then when we voice our displeasure how about taking it off the bill. Since neither happened its time to take Metro off my regular rotation. Too bad cause I couldn't wait for this location to open. Got to big to control quality.",

    "text": "Hmmm, reading through some of the recent reviews, I wonder why some people would give this place 3 stars or under. I feel, if you're going to rate somewhere and it be a deterrent to others to visit, you should have better reasoning other than the petty reasons people are listing. Just because you're having a bad day isn't a good enough reason to give a shitty review. Base it off of the food, service, cleanliness, etc. If you're in a bad mood, I'm pretty sure you're going to try to find the shittiness in everything - even though you shouldn't.   I liked this place a lot. The service was fast and friendly and the food was very good.  I would say that the prices are a little above my liking and that's the only reason I won't go here as often. But, I will pay extra when I want good pizza. I hate most American chains and I don't ever order from them. I don't care that it's cheaper.  We had -   Milano Pizza - it's their version of a white pizza. It was probably the best I've had in town. Very garlicy but they always are, and I dig me some garlic. Highly recommended if you like garlic too.  Half pepperoni/half sausage and olives. It was very good. Sauce was perfect, crust perfect and toppings were very good. The only thing is there was a hell of a lot more olives than sausage, but I'm not picky. I love both.  Hot wings - very delicious. Their buffalo sauce is very good here and it had the perfect amount of spice. They fried them perfectly. It wasn't too thick of breading, it was light and crispy.  I would highly recommend if you're in the area or if you tire of the normal pizza joints.  Overall, it's an awesome pizza place and sometimes, it's just worth paying extra money for better pizza.",

    "text": "If I could give the Decatur store in NW Vegas a negative number, I would. We used Door Dash to deliver a pizza. The order stated a gluten-free requirement. According to Metro, it was not mentioned when Door Dash placed the order with Metro. Maybe yes, maybe no...not my fault. The person that answered the phone at Metro was clearly concerned and tried to help. The managers (heard one in the background and got transferred to someone entirely different) said it wasn't their fault and there was nothing they WOULD do about it. What's a pizza really cost to make...a few bucks? How much would it mean to a hungry customer that often went to Metro Pizzas in the Vegas area and took others as well? Apparently a small gluten-free pizza and driving it to my home 2.5 miles away costs more than me never going again and steering neighbors and friends away from that location from now on. What ever happened to taking care of inexpensive problems that reflect badly on your brand?",

You are able to do half and half so we got half Patheon and half Piggy. Patheon was decent ingredients it was slightly bland and maybe needed seasoning on the toppings. Piggy was the opposite and was very flavorful with bbq sauce and pickles on it. Their crust was crispy, but is airier than.usual.   Service was decent. We were checked on and drinks refilled.   Overall, it was decent at the half off price, but not a spot I would seek or frequent.",

They have individual pizzas ans larger ones and if you are ordering an appetizer then try the meatball sliders they are really good and the garlic knots they use for them are made fresh to order. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. Check the website or ask your server for a monthly calendar to see what specials are going on it's something different each day. inside there is a good sized dining area with tables, booths and there is a bar also. There is a door for the restaurant and for pick up orders but you can go in either one depending on what side of the building you park. If you do order garlic knots keep in mind they are best eaten fresh from the oven at the restaurant because the couple of times I ordered them to go they didn't taste the same when I got home. The pizza on the other hand tastes good even left over for lunch the next day.",

    "text": "Although Metro Pizza has its own Social Media handle, (mis)managed by an \"influencer\" like so many others, those looking for Sin City's most innovative Pies know to follow @everythingbutanchovies, the personal account of Pizzaiolo Chris Decker who can frequently be found showing off his fresh new ideas at the Sky Pointe location.  Acting as the flagship of John Arena and Sam Facchini's family of pizzerias since November of 2012, an expansive footprint including Lulu's Bread & Breakfast allowing for lengthy fermentation of Metro's beautiful Crust, it is upon entry that guests will find themselves greeted by charming hostesses, a number of seating options offered including booths and tables.  Self-appointed \"America's Neighborhood Pizzeria\" since the early eighties, though even today so much more, once seated with a menu the most arduous part of a visit comes down to deciding which direction to venture, a collection of Appetizers competing with Pasta and Salad, though complimentary housemade Bread served piping hot with Butter may be enough for those who prefer save room for an extra Slice or two.  Brought north on this particular day by a pair of pictures from Chef Decker, the first an oft-requested special dubbed \"Meatbella,\" it is in embrace of #instagram that this oversized Pie fuses a traditional Brooklyn Round with the lesser known \"Stella,\" a star-shaped edge in this case folded around tender Meatballs with a medium-thin middle capable of standing up to a fold despite plenty of Pepperoni, Mozzarella and Tomatoes.  Moving next to Detroit's Red Top, the style currently experiencing a renaissance from coast-to-coast, it may come as a surprise to many that something thick and loaded with Cheese eats so light and fluffy, but be that as it may the combination of long leavening and good ingredients yields four exquisite slices, each with great diversity of texture thanks to its caramelized lattice.     Not about to forgo Metro's world-class Sicilian, the \"86th Street Square Pie\" now offered in halves, it remains as True today as ever that there is no better example of the genre within five-hundred miles (or more) and eating nearly light as the Red Top there will still be plenty of room to try something as unique as Chris' bounty from Desert Bloom Eco Farm, this week featuring two types of Potatoes plus Peas, their Tendrils and housemade Pesto.  Saving a bit of space for Dessert, Coconut and Peanut Butter Gelato both creamy and not overly sweet, it was leaving Carrot Cake for another day that Chocolate Fudge instead showed off its extra-moist Crumb and layers of Frosting, the addition of a Hot Fudge drizzle as plated further gilding the proverbial lily.",

Metro always serves bread and butter before you get your pizza or  pasta.  These are freshly made and always excellent.  Next came a calzone filled with great whipped ricotta, diced ham, and mozzarella.  Next came an interesting and tasty pie made with mascarpone cream, grape tomatoes, basil, and parmesan cheese.  This was followed by a pie with crispy kale, house sausage, provolone, and two kinds of pepper.  Last was my favorite, the 86th Street Sicilian style pizza, half plain, half pepperoni, all great!  At the end of our meal, we were pleased to have master bread man and pizza maker, Chris Decker, come to our table and talk about some of the different things he's tried with the pies.

I recommend the meatball sliders from the appetizer menu.  They are available for a reduced price, as they have happy hour with many of their popular appetizers as well as beer.  I think the happy hour is between 4 and 6 pm Sun. through Thur., but check with the location for confirmation.  The happy hour prices are available in the dining room as well as the bar area.    There are also plenty of TVs for sporting events in the bar area, so this is a good place to catch a game too.    None of us in our party had the pizza, but it is apparently the most popular menu item given the name of the restaurant and we saw pizza being ordered constantly at other tables.   If you don't order a pizza you can go with the chicken parmigiana, as it was cooked perfectly and was enough to take home for leftovers.   The dinner entrees come with a salad and bread is served at the outset for the whole party.",

Bread arrived at the table but the was not a utensil to had.  A request....was requested for utensils...I did not think this was unusual.  I mean...should I spread butter butter with my finger?  This request had to be made an additional time.  Service was all in all lacking.  Had we not been there with my nephew, I would have walked out.  Not busy....more than enough staff hanging out, this should have been a 5 star dining experience, but it was left wanting.  But why the 3 stars?  Well, that's because the chow (pizza) is pretty good.  If your patient, which at times...I am not, and willing to deal with the possibility of subpar service...give it a shot!",

The service was good very good we had around 15 people in this graduation party and we were short five chairs.the waiter immediately requested the help of another server and they produced five of the chairs they were on top of their game. I gave this place for stars due to the service that they gave me they were always efficient and very very customer service orientated. I would recommend this place if you are looking for the typical pizzeria and bar style food even though this is not a bar. The price is a little hi for what you order. If I had to say one thing stood out to me it would be the chicken fingers with the buffalo sauce that was pretty awesome.",

The food is typcially consistent, pizza is pretty stinkin' good - an east coast style which I really enjoy. Lately the mozerella triangles have been overcooked, but the garlic knots are always on point - they're huge!  Something we really enjoy is that they'll tell you it will arrive in 45 mins to an hour, but they always deliver at right around 30 minutes. I'm a big fan of WOWing your customer, and Metro Pizza is pretty good at doing just that.",

So I asked the waiter how it was made and he just agreed to how I was asking the question like is it just toppings on a plate with a bed of cheese \"yup\" he said. So I took a gamble and sure enough I got sauce, cheese and toppings served in a bowl for 13.95. I was very disappointed they could have loaded it up for me but got a slop. I asked if there was a discount considering the dough I didn't use which makes a pizza filling wasn't used he said \"nope\" sorry and walked away. My husband wasnt all to impressed either. We ended up stopping at McDs for a burger no bun for $3 that had more substance then that place. Never going back.",

It's a pepperoni pizza with meatballs in the crust with garlic butter and park cheese on the crust. It's like a meatball slider attached to a pepperoni slice of pizza. Total yum!

    "text": "This time around, despite knowing that ample stomach room was needed to address a large pizza to come, fresh Pizza Dough Bread slathered with butter just could not be completely resisted.  At least I limited myself to just 2 slices!  A bean-studded Small Minestrone Soup differed somewhat in ingredients from previous versions but was still packed with fresh mixed vegetables & pasta.  And a Small Dinner Salad graced with Metro Pizza's own formula for a zesty, tomato-based Italian Dressing was another great starter, along with a cheesy Mozzarella Stick.  But, as usual, top-notch saucy and cheesy New York style pizzas were justifiably placed squarely in the spotlight.  A Large Ham Pizza with Extra Cheese greatly pleased Diane; a Small New York Pepperoni Pizza satisfied my two dining companion friends; and I was quite happy with my order of a Large The Gotham Pizza with added cooked sliced Tomatoes, which was already studded with a whopping six included toppings: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, crunchy Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions, and featured a perfectly executed supple crust.  If I were to order this pizza again, I would have reduced or eliminated the Onions, which were just more dominant than I prefer.  But this is more of a quibble than any real complaint.  Seating at two joined tables was comfortable; the casual Italian ambiance authentic for a pizza parlor; and waitstaff service swift, accurate, and commendable.          Another five-star-level pizza eating outing at this Metro Pizza location!",

    "text": "Yay!!!! So glad this location is finally open!!!!! Being from Vegas I grew up eating at Metro Pizza. Who from here didn't?!?!  The pizza is so darn good that we would drive across town to the Flamingo or Trop location because it tasted that good. So, to have one after all these years right in the neighborhood is just such a bonus!  I will say this. The parking is odd. They have 2 separate doors. One is for take out orders and the other is for being seated inside the restaurant to eat. It isn't well marked so either door could look like either door. We parked near the take out and were eating inside. We needed a handicapped spot. The curb you step onto from the parking lot to go inside is very high. Please be careful of this anybody could easily trip and fall. I believe it could be meant to be a ramp for wheelchairs but when walking you have no choice but to step over it and it could easily be missed if your talking or looking around.  The inside is huge! There were tons of staff hustling around inside. They have a bar so you can just pop in for a drink or even have a drink before being seated or waiting on someone. There is a hostess stand where you wait to be seated and we were greeted and seated right away. A moment later a bread basket was dropped off at the table. Yum! The server came to take our drink orders and she was very friendly, nice and took great care of us.   We ordered some \"Garlic Knots\". Delish!  They have meatball sliders that I have had in the past and they use the garlic knots for the bread you should give those a try!  I had the \"South Side\". It is a stuffed pizza and SO good! It has 3 cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, romano) and came with a side of sauce. I love their sauce! I ordered the individual size but let me tell you it is so stuffed with cheese that this is a sharable or a take home for another meal kind of a pizza!   The inside is very clean. The moment after someone leaves they are wiping down the tables and everything on it.   They have a monthly calendar that has daily specials. You can get one inside any restaurant or directly from there website. You can also follow them on facebook.  We were very pleased and will for sure be back!",

Ordered a large pepperoni with pineapples and extra sauce, along with garlic knots. The pizza dough nor the garlic knots were cooked all the way. And some how there was a miscommunication. Instead of extra sauce, there was extra cheese - enough to choke a horse! For the price, we were expecting better quality or better attention to the results. Undercooked food is unpleasant.",

    "text": "Very rude and nasty little cashier/hostess named \"Brit\"; also subpar pizza  OK, so I'm a fan of the Ellis Island location. so I figured why not try out this location as well.  I love the buy one get one large pizza deal they have at Ellis (Sundays) so I confirmed with the person taking the order on the phone that yes, they have the same deal as Ellis Island buy one get one.  So, I arrive and go into the takeout entrance to pick up the pizza.  When I go to pay, \"Brit\" tells me the total is $31 and some change.  I said, \"hold on, you told me it was buy one get one when I ordered on the phone so total should be around $21\".   She starts to argue with me and says, \"I never told you that, our deal is buy 1 get one half-off\".  So I said, \"I would have never ordered if that was the case because you said it was the same deal as Ellis buy one get one\".   We go back and forth a few times.  Obviously, she doesn't know what buy one get one means.  Then, I couldn't believe this, Brit, snatches the pizza boxes off the counter and acts like she is gonna put them away back in the kitchen.  With major attitude, she snaps, \"Well do you want them or not\"!?  I should have asked for a manager by now, but instead pay the $31 cause I'm starving and figure I'll speak with manager from home.  The 2 large pizzas were not up to normal standards for Metro. Just soggy, salty, and just plain sad. Nasty!!   So I call back 2x and am put on hold for almost 10 minutes, then she says our manager will call you back in a little while. Ok fine.  Receive call back from manager Jen who was actually helpful and apologetic. I explained the situation and told her that if an employee of mine acted like Brit, she should be fired on the spot.  So I got a $10 credit for my next trip.  But don't think I'll ever return.  Best off that I stick with Ellis Island Metro Pizza.",

    "text": "Pizza is far from my favorite type of food but I just can't get enough of Metro! We waited anxiously for this location to open and since opening day, we've been there quite a few times. While I love Metro, I have to give them only 4 stars, mainly for consistency issues...  Let me talk about the food first though. By far, my wife and I's favorite pizza here is the buffalo chicken. It is just flat out good. The chicken and blue cheesed mixed with onions are celery are a perfect combination. And the buffalo sauce they use is great, super good buffalo taste and its not too spicy but not too mild either. There other pizzas are really good too. From the not so usual seafood pizza to your standard pepperoni, they just make good pizza!   Appetizers are mostly good too. We can't talk about Metro without bringing up the bread. When you get it hot and fresh, it's hard not to get yourself nearly full on the bread. The garlic knots are a must try! I also really like the meatball sliders which they use garlic knots as the bun for. If you're in the mood for wings, Metro has decent wings also. The only thing I don't like too much are the fries. They use a great spice on the nuclear fries but the fries themselves just aren't quite there.   Like I mentioned, Metro has some consistency issues. We went opening night and I can tell you it's gotten way better since then, but they still have some kinks to work out. We've had some not so great service and sometimes the pizza doesn't come out like it did the last time. Less toppings or sauce, whatever it may be. The other thing that bothers me is the bread inconsistency. Since we love the bread so much, it's disappointing getting a burnt loaf or one that's cold.  Metro is a must try in my opinion. They are a little on the expensive side but the monthly calendar with daily deals are great. And if you can make it during a weekday for the 50% off deal, its a perfect way to try it for the first time.",

I've ordered delivery a few times now. Delivery has been timely, although the delivery fee for delivery within 3 miles is a little steep, it's not horrendous. My biggest complaint is that the pizza is soggy. I pay 28 dollars for a pizza (not including tip) I do expect it not to be soggy. It's hot and mostly delicious, and crisp until about halfway to the center of the pizza when crust becomes soggy! I first thought it was a one time thing, but no, this has been the third time ordering delivery with soggy pizza.   That being said, this has never been an issue dining in.",

The place is very roomy and open inside.  It has a welcome family feeling to the atmosphere here.  I have been there twice and the service has been good.  Also, they have specials everyday.  They had a special for the Rebel game, and in this town that has little support for the basketball program, this deserves a high five!  The garlic knots were really good.  The bread they bring out to the table tastes great too, I would buy a loaf to take home.  This time we ordered a spring street pizza with regular crust.  Meatballs, ricotta, red peppers, green peppers and topped with fresh basil.  The basil was a nice touch because the aroma gets the taste buds going right away.  The sauce is tasty - not too sweet but a nice fresh tomato taste.  The crust on their regular pizza is somewhat thin but still holds up well to the heap of toppings.  The crust had a nice crunch to it too.  They have a thick crust option and stuffed pizzas too.  The prices are reasonable especially if you consider one pie could fill up 3-4 regular eaters.  I was stuffed on 2 pieces.  This place just does what a restaurant is supposed to do: good service, they take pride in their food offerings, clean and welcoming atmosphere and fair prices.  It makes it obvious why some places are busy and some places close down...",

We got there at 2:30 right when happy hour started not many people inside my daughter ordered a kids meal individual cheese pizza with light sauce. Me and my son ordered a large Bleecker Street which came out in about 20 minutes before my kids pizza. Myself and my son finished our slices, and my kids pizza will still not out.   Our waitress came up with a crazy excuse of the pizza cook did not time it well. So me and my son were already finished with our slices of a large pizza and my little eight-year-old still waiting for her kids meal. When the kids meal pizza came out it had extra sauce on it, so we told the waitress and then had to make her another one. This is where they should've comped The kids meal and a manager should've come over and apologize for the mishap. They didn't do anything, and it was a really weird experience. Not the type of Service I expect at Metro Pizza. I frequent this place often, and this is the first time that something like this happened. The pizza is amazing. I believe the waitress forgot to turn in her order, or the the pizza chef just forgot to make it and she came up with some stupid excuse about his timing being off. I mean how can a large pizza come out 25 minutes before an individual child's pizza? And then when it comes out it has extra sauce instead of light sauce?? Today it seems like a lot of people who are working in the kitchen or just constantly talking and not paying much attention. We got there at 2:30 and there was really no one there, so truly no excuses   .",

ALL the chicken sandwhiches after taking a bite were completely RAW.  I called the manager over and she PROFUSELY appogized and informed us that when she saw our large group enter she asked the kitchen manager to stay and help, they REFUSED!! And essentially left her to hang out to dry. Metro Pizza you should find this UNACCEPTABLE and hold your kitchen manager accountable. The female manager on duty should be applauded for the way she handled it. RAW chicken can KILL people. You can call me at 661-742-9465 and we can discuss it if you want. Because of the way it was handled I'll give 3 stars.",

I waited 20 minutes for an order of nuke fies which was not evenly distributed, meaning it seems like they threw the fries in a container and dropped a handful of their spice and bagged it. The only thing I can say that stands out is the bread for the meatball sliders and the choice of tap beer.",

It took about 15 minutes for drinks, another 5 for bread, 15 minutes to take orders, and then 45 minutes to actually receive our food!!! First the most part the food is great, but they forget to mention that their thin crust is just thick crust just not as thick as the \"metro\" way. You have to ask for extra thin crust for something nice and crunchy...they will not offer it to you. Also one entre of meatball sliders came out with cold centered meatballs. You could tell our waitress was annoyed, which was uncomfortable...but I couldn't blame her...no one should have to handle huge parties by themselves. Based on other reviews, they either need stronger more experienced waiters, or they need to have more working.",

Before he could finish she curtly said \"No\". He politely finished his sentence, explaining that our 7 year was diabetic and we needed the information to calculate her insulin.  She then said, just as rudely \"still no, do you want to place your drink orders?\" We did stay, but only because we brought people and we felt bad.  The service did not improve and it took a very long time to receive our food even though the restaurant was not busy.  I'm sorry, I don't care how good your food is.  It does not make up for poor customer service.",

The pizza's and food items are not the best in town, except for the mac-n-cheese, I think it is the best! I used to work in a pizza joint in So Ca and I know the amount of work that goes into making fresh dough, sauce and prep. However the prices here are still too high. If you have access to the metro guys calendar then go on the special days and make sure you mention the special and you will definitely get a bang for your buck!",

We ordered our pizza and due to my wife having allergies the pie was asked to only have sauce on one side. When the pizza arrived it was not to order. We asked for a personal size pizza to be made so she could eat. By the time her pizza arrived I was done earthing and had to have the smaller pizza boxed and saved for later. Although the the small pie was comped we go out to eat as a couple. The pizza was runny and not worth the money. It was comparable to Dominoes except for the price. I don't believe we will be going back to this wanna be pizzeria.",

The calamari is very good, it is a different breading than I am used to but is makes an incredible difference. Nice and tender not over cooked not undercooked and there is a lot of it there.   We ordered the pantheon pizza. I am not usually a fan of white sauce pizzas but let me tell you this one is extremely good! I would have it again, and I was hesitant to order it at first. The crust is light and crispy without being over cooked. The sauce is just right and the toppings are spot on.   The service was excellent as well",

I asked to speak to one of the owners to tell them how impressed we were and how nice it was for them to be so generous with their discount but neither owner was in.

We did not have the highest of expectations. Unfortunately, it still fell short.   The staff was nice enough but there was nothing memorable about them at all. The furniture was fairly beat up and the food was sub-standard. My wife had eaten at another Metro Pizza years ago and remembered that they had delicious garlic knots. This time however, they were not good. They were very dry. My wife and I both ordered the stromboli, and the kids shared a small cheese pizza. All of it was extremely greasy and unappetizing. The stromboli looked more like a panini. The kids barely ate one slice a piece of their pizza. If you are looking for a nice pizza place to take the family, you can do much better than Metro Pizza. Not terrible but definitely below average.",

If we're in the mood for pizza it's usually one spot at the top of the list.   I called them to place an order and to my surprise the lady stated they delivered as well. I gave her my cross streets and she stated it was an additional $5 so I placed my order and loved the fact that I didn't have to pick it up.   Our total was $140, for 4 large pizzas, 40 pieces of wings and 2 orders of their Romano fries. As usually we took great care of our delivery man.   .......... Sadly, our pizza was cold and over baked. Our fries were stale and drenched in oil. The center of our wings weren't cooked throughout. Hence, we had company I decided to work with what we had. The dining experience is worthy of 4-5 the delivery service is awful. I'm definitely steering away from ever ordering out again.",

What was most impressive was that he reached out to me and was proactive about taking care of me and my family and making sure we were satisfied with Metro Pizza.

    "text": "The hardest part about ordering from Metro Pizza was deciding which of the amazing-sounding dishes to order. While I was tempted by the pizza and pasta, I ultimately chose the Ranch Chicken Salad because 1) I had a heavy lunch already and 2) I read another review that raved about their ranch dressing. I'm known to be selective about my ranch so reading the review that claimed that their ranch is nothing like Hidden Valley (because that is NOT ranch...bleh!) sealed the deal. The salad was huge and plenty for two meals, if not three, for me. It's topped with chicken fingers, tomatoes, mozzarella, cucumbers and croutons and comes with a hunk of (sourdough?) bread on the side. I asked for an extra side of ranch and was so happy I did as soon as I discovered the absolute wonderfulness of the ranch. Definitely one of the better ranch dressings that I've ever tasted and I'm very thankful for the other reviewer for describing it in such a perfect way. This is True restaurant quality ranch.   My only slight complaint is that in addition to the lettuce, which is stated on the menu, the salad also included spinach. I can't stand spinach and had to created a reject pile on the side of my plate as I uncovered spinach leaves. Also, I'm not a fan of cucumbers but thought I could easily pick off the slices so I didn't make any special requests. Of course, though, in this case the cucumbers were finely diced and more difficult to remove.  Although we ordered our food to go, the restaurant looks like a charming place to eat and I'd be happy to make this a regular stop if I lived in the area.",

Our waitress only had three tables and got our order wrong, and instead of correcting it she asked if we were ok with the different order. She took forever to get us our check. I never tip bad, but I did tonight. My husband actually took the kids to the car while I just waited for another 15 min to pay.  Then my friend wanted gelato and they were out of vanilla, chocolate, and cookies and cream. Maybe they should stock up on the popular gelato.  I might order food from them, but their wait staff sucks big time.  Hesitant about giving them any more chances.",

One was a spaghetti with meat sauce and the other one was a rigatoni with sausage and onion and pepper, and it was decent but nothing special. Also tried the grotto pizza and it was alright. When we went there, there's no silverwares and they dropped the bread down, no knifes for the butter, after that they dropped down the pasta and salad and we still didn't have any silverwares, like really? I had to look for the server to get some simple utensil. Also, they never ask if we needed any red pepper or Parmesan. There are some tables that have different condiments but not on every table. They also never really check in on you, just drop the food off and go. I'll probably never come back, at least not this location.",

    "text": "We ate a late lunch here. After finding a way to enter this pizza place (it was a bit confusing navigating the entrance of this place), we were rewarded with an awesome dining experience. Our waiter, Ed, introduced himself to us. He was friendly and very helpful with suggestions, since this was our first time eating here. We decided on Garlic Romano fries & Nuclear fries for appetizers, both of them were very good. The Nuclear fries had a nice heat to it, and went nicely with the ranch dressing dipping sauce (that came with both fries). We also got the Steinbrenner calzone which was very delicious. The eggplant parmigiana in it was perfectly done. Along with a large Skyline stuffed pizza, which was both tasty and very substantial, the meat sauce on it was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet, while the crust was very good. Sauce and crust are the most important things on a pizza and they nailed them both. For desert, we had the Spumoni pie and Cannoli. Again both were very good, but we were so full by then that we had to take it to go. We highly recommend this place and waiter Ed for a great dining experience. I forgot to mention about the bread that they serve before we started to eat. It's baked on site and is delicious, but don't get carried away eating it or you're not going be able eat the rest of your food.",

A young girl (not our waiter) dropped off our pizza to the table and before we could ask for plates she ran off. We sat there for a couple minutes trying to get the attention of someone who worked there. Finally we flagged down the hostess and asked for plates and a serving knife since it didn't have one and the pizza was really hot. Finally after about 10 mins we finally were able to start eating. Mid meal the waiter picks up my boyfriends drink I assumed to refill and after about 10 mins we look around and the waiter is behind the counter chatting with all of his co workers, completely forgot to bring back our drink. Again, we had to ask a busser near by to help us. On our way out we decided to get some dessert in the to go area. We ordered a piece of cake and a scoop of ice cream. After the girl took our money she said \"ok have a great day!\" I looked at her confused and said \" can I have my dessert?\" She laughed and gave my my cake and gave me a blank stare. My boyfriend had ordered a scoop of gelato and i said \"I ordered and paid for gelato also\" which threw me off because she had been the one to take the order. Overall bizarre and frustrating experience. These kids obviously don't really care for their jobs.",

We also ordered fried mozzarella, and wings. The wings were fantastic. The fried mozzarella normally comes in sticks, but here it comes in large triangular pieces with an amazing breading. The cannoli's are delicious too! We did takeout, but after going and seeing how nice this place is set up, we will be dining in next time! By the way the staff I interacted with just for pick were amazing. They even offered my girls free samples of the gelato, which by the way again AMAZING!!!",

We were there on a Saturday afternoon and seated in the bar area, which really isn't that separated from the rest of the dining room.  Our server, also the bartender Tony greeted us quickly and was great at suggesting some pizza choices.  We went with the Gotham.  Cooked perfect.  Loved getting some bread to start out the meal  My beer was cold, Tony shared some good jokes, great family atmosphere.  Thanks to Tony we will be back for sure!.",

    "text": "This is a review for their food and delivery service.  I ordered their stuffed pasta pizza. Everything in it was spot on. It was not greasy, which is really common when it comes to pizza and especially with stuffed pies. It's a really thick crust that had a bit of sweet to it, something that I love in pizza. It reminds me of pizza from Northern NJ and New York City, where I'm originally from. Now as for the chicken wings. They are among the best I've had. Again, it's not greasy even with the sauce on. The wings are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had the mild sauce and it was pretty spot on, just enough kick to it.  Metro is a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum but you see it in the quality of the food you get. The delivery fee to my area was $3, which is average compared to all other delivery places. Really good service, had extra sauces for everything included.  I have to say that Metro is worth the extra money for the quality of food you get.",

This weekend I decided to try it out for the first time and took the family out for pizza.  The waitress that served us was great! Friendly attitude, quick service, very knowledgable of the menu, and was even great with my kids (we all know they are the True test)  We went with her recommendation and had a Stuffed Pizza.  The pizza was amazing!  I have nothing negative to say, all my expectations were exceeded!  We will definitely will be coming back!",

EVERYONE I know for a FACT who lives in Centennial was waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this place to open because after all the other locations are AMAZING!

I bet people who like this place have not tried the other locations. They should, then they would see that this location SUCKS!! Guess I will continue driving all the way to Tropicana!",

After an hour of waiting for our food (1 hour and 20 minutes to be exact) and calling to get a status, our food arrived cold, soggy and worse than a frozen pizza that was leftover and reheated. Unfortunately we will not be ordering from them again, take out, dine in or delivery.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this location and others around town for over 15 years. Metro is my go to pizzeria when I have relatives and friends in town. I have taken the pizza class with my meet up group 3 times. My experience yesterday may warrant a change in Pizzerias. I ordered 1 large cheese and mushroom and 1 large cheese, sausage and bell pepper for carry-out. They brought my pizzas out and he had me check them. This must have been the skimpiest pizza from metro I've ever had. When you order a pizza with just one or a few toppings shouldn't it cover the pizza just as much as if I ordered a pizza with lots of different toppings like a combination? A large has 8 slices. I could have taken all the mushrooms off the pizza and it wouldn't have covered  2 slices.  The same for the sausage and bell pepper. Okay, I get it...sausage is more expensive and may not give  them a higher profit margin in their food cost but seriously, mushrooms and bell pepper? It crossed my mind at that moment to not pay for them and express my dissatisfaction but I actually had out-of-state relatives waiting for me at home. If their \"buy 1 get 2nd half off large pizzas\" are at this subpar quality would I have received a pizza that had generous toppings if I paid full price? No thanks, I'd prefer the latter. With embarrassment, I served the pizzas to my guests. I'm sure they were thinking, \"this is what she was raving about?\"",

We've been coming here since 2002, we've been to all locations, and we have never had a bad meal or bad service. When family comes into town from San Diego, they usually meet us here...as in they don't even want to come to our house to drop their luggage off. Lately, this has us wondering, are they here to see us or are they here for the Metro Pizza?? They demand we eat here at least 2x per visit. Just the other day, my husband used the Pasta Pie (a must try) as a fantasy football trade incentive. The pizza is that powerful. The latest pizza we ordered--with the always perfect, thick metro crust, had to be the best ever. The crust was so perfect; thick but airy, crisp yet soft. After a decade of enjoying this pizza, you don't think it can actually get better. But it does. Each pizza is a masterpiece...and that's exactly how they treat it.",
