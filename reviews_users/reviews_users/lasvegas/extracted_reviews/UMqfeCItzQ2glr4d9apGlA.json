Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I used to consider myself a regular here; getting coffee 2 -3 times per week usually. I've increasingly noticed over the past few months the service and quality of coffee has taken a nose dive. Possibly from a new staff.  My guests and I have encountered frequent attitude problems, laziness and order 'mess ups' from the staff almost every time we've gone here the past few months. I'm sick of it.  The quality of the espresso seems increasingly inconsistent too which is a bummer. I usually don't care enough to write a bad review on a place but it's been so unpleasant every time I've been here recently I've decided to switch my go to coffeehouse to another business. Sorry Sunrise.",

    "text": "One thing that I love about good coffee places is that it's not too loud and it's a perfect place to meet a friend or to study. Sunrise Coffee has it! The atmosphere is very relaxing, and the outdoor seating area is charming.   The barista behind the counter was very nice and helpful. She recommended to us the Nutella and Creme Brulee lattes. We got them iced and delivered to us while we sat at a couple of old brown chairs. The chairs were pretty worn out and had rips all over them, but that was the least of my worries. I came to Sunrise because I heard they had good coffee and I was excited for my Nonfat Creme Brulee Iced Latte! We paid a little under $10 total.  So it began! Tasted, pause for the aftertaste, tasted again. Tasted my boyfriend's Nutella latte, pause, tasted again... unfortunately... they were alright. =(   Yummy, but didn't have that extra oomph I enjoy so much in Grouchy John's, Sambalatte's or Starbucks' lattes. I get nonfat milk all the time so I'm sure that wasn't it. Also, the Creme Brulee had a very VERY extremely light brulee taste, and I had to search hard for its notes. The Nutella had so little Nutella in there as well. If I wasn't in a rush, I might've asked for just a teeny little more Nutella. I felt like the only Nutella that was in there was drizzled on the sides of the cup to make it look pretty. Overall, not impressed. But a plus for the service and atmosphere.",

Sunrise Coffee is nestled in a small, unassuming complex right near a small Thai restaurant (note to self: try sometime! their menu looks awesome!). There are several different styles of booths and tables inside, and even though it's busy, Sunrise Coffee is still a place where you can talk comfortably with a friend or nestle in to get some work done.  The four stars are completely for the staff. The three gentlemen behind the counter were very polite, friendly, and hilarious (when I asked for a spicy chai, one of the baristas joked that he could add chili powder for an extra kick). My latte was ready in what seemed like only 30 seconds and off I went.  Unfortunately, the chai tea latte was NOT what I expected. I'm not deducting stars for this because maybe I underestimated exactly what a \"dirty\" latte is. It seemed very bitter and grainy to me, not at all like the normal sweet and spicy lattes that I enjoy. I choked it down because I spent over $4 for the cup, but I definitely would not order it again.   I will go again but order something different!",

I've only been here three times (so far), but the atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly, and the coffee and food are delicious. It gets pretty busy in there during the afternoon, but I never have to wait too long after I've ordered to get my coffee and food. That's especially helpful since I come in during my lunch break. There's a decent amount of seating indoors, and you also have the option of sitting outside.   My only qualms would be with the parking. The parking in front is pretty limited since it's shared with neighboring stores. There's plenty of parking behind the shop as you go further into the plaza, but you just have to be cautious of cars going through the drive-thru.   Overall, I definitely enjoy coming here.",

This little piece of heaven is not only locally owned but its an all organic coffeehouse! That in and of itself is reason enough to check it out..but its soo much more! Various couches, chairs and tables are strewn about in the perfect manner. The walls are lined with amazing artwork from, what I assume, are local artists. The far left wall is filled with books, giving it that \"Yeah, I'm cool but I'm smart too\" vibe. If you prefer to enjoy your coffee/ lunch alfresco, I suggest hitting Sunset Park (which is 2 mins away) since the 'patio' is somewhat lacking.   DRINKS: I gather that they have amazing espresso (nutella, really?), but I am more of a tea girl myself. The Chai is AMAZING! I do a half sweet, 1/2 pump SFV, soy Chai with light ice and never receive the \"She thinks she's a diva\" dirty looks from any of the wonderful staff members. (The Starbucks staff always roll their eyes when i order my drink, bastards) It always tastes of PERFECTION.   FOOD: And if that wasn't enough they bring us THE ALIEN BURRITO! ALIEN BURRITO= Spinach wrap filled with lettuce, tomatoes, hummus, beans, avocado, couscous, cheese and sour cream. Sounds so simple but SO good.  I'm going back for lunch today! Maybe I'll see you there ;)",

    "text": "Sunrise Coffee will make you WISH you were a vegetarian.   I have thought about it for a while and decided that the only way to describe the Alien Burrito is YUM-MAZING. I had to make up a word to describe its tastiness. It is so good that I actually can't eat any more Alien Burritos for a while because I ate one every day for like 3 weeks and over dosed because that is the kind of YUM-addict I am. My inside fat kid never quits.  Let me explain how I love coffee: I drink coffee black. I think cream and sugar is for people who hate coffee. I won't drink Folgers unless it is an emergency. Like the kind of emergency where someone died. I am a coffee snob. So it BLEW MY MIND when I realized that Sunrise roasts their coffee beans in house. Are you kidding me, who does that? I'm in love.   I don't drink lattes and other coffee drinks but I'm sure they are fantastic, too. It is difficult for me to imagine that anything at Sunrise is anything short of amazing. I'm sure they use real espresso machines and not those automated ones Starbucks switched over to.   I'll admit I was a little bit freaked out that they had the iPads for ordering because that is so cool I'm probably too old to be in there. However, the service is super friendly and the hipster vibe is not uncomfortable.  I really think this is what Starbucks aspires to be and maybe what it was in its youth. You really owe it to yourself to check out Sunrise if you want to have a real coffee shop experience. I am also going to bring this up at the next vegetarian meeting because I think the Alien Burrito is the holy grail of vegetarian food.",

Needless to say as a San Franciscan I was skeptical but Sunrise uses bold flavored beans in their espresso drinks and the finished product is quite tasty.

The interior has nice wood tones, plenty of seating and large windows, although it can feel a bit cramped when it's a packed house. But the outside patio is large and has lots of seating too, which is especially nice when the weather permits. The coffee is good and varies day to day, but it's a bit weird that they don't have a dark roast. The employees are all very nice and the vibe is very hipster, but not in what can be an exclusionary way. They always greet customers when they walk in. They also keep the shop VERY clean, always wiping down the tables and perpetually mopping and sweeping the floor. The pastries and baked goods are very good and varied; I haven't had any of their wraps so I can't comment on those.   The only drawbacks, if there are any, is that the shop is relatively small and can be very loud when it's bustling. Also, the employees usually have to yell over the crowd when their drinks are ready, so that can be quite loud as well.   All in all, I enjoy the ambiance, the nice employees, the coffee, and the awesome nineties mixes that will periodically play over the shop's speakers. If you're interested in good coffee and a nice place to meet up with friends or study, I would give Sunrise a chance.",

Maybe it's the organic health factor or the vegan aspect, but I'm just something I'm not use to.  I ordered a regular Iced Cafe Latte and the wife went with the Iced Mint Frappi. Both of them tasted a bit earthly and bitter. Other than that, the place is clean and the staff is friendly.   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italia n Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",

They have a drive-thru if you're on the go-but don't have their pourover coffee available through the drive-thru, which makes sense, but it's so worth waiting and putting a little effort in for a pourover. They have a variety of single source coffees to choose from, from what I believe is their own roaster, \"Mothership\". I was recommended and really enjoyed the Guatemalan roast. The croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, spinach and avocado was excellent. The staff was super friendly and made great recommendations and you can tell take pride in what they do. I'd definitely come back.",

Outside seating is also available but it was a bit hot and humid out this day.   The coffee is organic and is roasted in house and tastes wonderful.  I love the idea that they are environmentally conscious and offer their coffee in a mug if you are not taking it to go!  However the blended drinks come in a plastic cup but even that is made from recyclable material and is compostable.    My friend ordered the Mint Mocha Coffee and I ordered the Caramel Frappe both with non-fat milk, of course!.  My friend said that her coffee was the perfect blend of mint, mocha and coffee and she was really impressed!  I loved the Caramel Frappe!  Perfectly blended to a great consistency that did melt super fast!  The drink had just the right amount of sweetness and quenched my caramel hankering.    There was a sign stating that there was going to be music here that evening.  I'm guessing that this is a common occurrence here.    They also have a nice collection of books if you would like to sit and read.    We were here for about 2.5 hours and with the amount of people that were here the entire time I truly believe that this place either needs to expand or open another location.  It was also hot in there or they were having AC issues or maybe a tactic to keep people from staying to long.  :)    Overall I will be back and normally do stop by when I am in the area!",

WHY we didn't drive, is beyond me... we walk in and there is no menu board.. let's just say my friends almost gang jumped me out of pure frustration that we just cabbed it for a cup of coffee. We all immediately walk out to re-group... while they are outside steaming, I walk back in to scope the scene because I KNOW they have food. AH-HA! I found the paper menus on the counter. I head out side and hand my friends the menu, truly relieved that we didn't just cab it for coffee.   The coffee I ordered was spot on, so good. I ordered the infamous Alien burrito and it was amazing. Everyone was super satisfied with breakfast (THANKFULLY - or I would have never heard the end of it)...The only problem is how far it is from the strip...but I'm pretty sure the cabby took the LONG route.",

There's a little nook in the corner with some couches and a coffee table, a high-top community table , another bigger table, and then a ton of two tops around.  There's some counter-top seating along the west wall too.  Outside that west wall, there's a nice looking pergola that's got another dozen or so two-tops/benches.  It's a little split brained - the outside seating has these organic looking chairs, while inside they've got a lot of metal and light wood in a kind of standard, modern coffee shop feel.  Looks like they use Mothership Roasting.  I hadn't heard of them, and a quick Google search turns up a super hipster looking website for this Vegas based roaster - copper Hario V60s and Buono kettles with subway tiles in the background.  The drip coffee I had was solid.  The one negative would be that there's not a ton of outlets . . . definitely not a deal breaker, but just something to plan around.",

    "text": "Such a fantastic little gem in a subpar location. Although my office is nearby, endless construction along Sunset causes it to be quite difficult to make it here in a reasonable amount of time. Initially, I decided to give Sunrise a try after a friend let me know that they offer several vegan and gluten-free options. I was quite excited to see what the offerings were since Las Vegas is not the most veg-friendly/gluten-free friendly city. Unfortunately, although Sunrise does offer some vegan options and some gluten free options, their gluten free granola/one daily muffin selection are the only options that are vegan as well. I was rather disappointed after my first visit since I was informed they were out of the granola and muffins I would normally be able to have. Because I was really hungry, I opted for a banana and a side of cashew butter and a fancy coffee.  The latte I received was beautifully presented, and I love that they serve drinks in mugs rather than wasting paper and/or plastic. I was also really impressed with the overall customer service. Since they were out of the granola that day, the barista was kind enough to give me a card for two free food items my next visit. Even more impressive, he apparently found some granola after I sat down and brought it to me with almond milk, on the house (so awesome!). I should probably also add that I could honestly care less that the only options for me are the granola and/or muffins (if available) because they are incredibly good.  I highly recommend trying out this locally owned, independent coffee shop. They use biodegradable cutlery and plastic cups; offer organic, fair trade coffee; and high quality, organic loose leaf teas. The only thing missing are a few different vegan AND 100% gluten-free pastries.",

    "text": "Sunrise is the spirit of Sunset. Situated off of Sunset Road between Eastern Avenue and Pecos Road six lanes across from Sunset Park and under the flight path, Sunrise creates an agreeable community environment in a disagreeable world. Over the years, I have driven to Sunset to experience the spirit of Sunrise.      In a city where casinos close overnight and Vegas history is instantly erased for so-called progress; Sunrise Coffee is a small business success story. It is a success story that goes back to 2008 when the owners Josh Walter and Juanny Romero opened Sunrise Coffee and turbocharged the independent Las Vegas coffee scene faster than a grande shot of expresso. Sunrise Coffee has won accolades and high ratings for their coffee and coffee house environment. Sunrise is considered by many to be the longest opened independent coffee shop in Las Vegas.     This award winning coffee shop is a spot that I have spent hours in. Today on National Frappe Day, I celebrated the beverage here. To be to the point their Frape is not their strong point. I paid $5.50 for a drink that was slushy and lacked the flavor of competing Frappes. It was nothing like the Truffle berry flame that I enjoyed a year ago. Nothing is perfect. However their coffee that I drank at least 40 times is close to perfect.     I am a fan of the drip coffee. It is a drip coffee that Sunrise blends themselves under their Mothership banner. The coffee is flavorful and strong. When you add in my Mothership visits (their sister shop) I have enjoyed their coffee at least 70 times. The coffee comes out to $2.70 for a medium. Additionally their chocolate chip cookie is the bomb.      The inner space of Sunrise is a contradiction to the outer space of Sunset. Across from the open grass of Sunset Park, the inside space of Sunrise is crowded. Their reputation speaks in an often nearly full house of coffee drinkers ranging from hipsters to independent people like me. From the corner couch to the bar seats and east wall booths; Sunrise is a happening scene from sunrise to sunset. It is a happening scene that extends to the outside patio. On a cooler day, the outside patio offers an unusual coffee house activity, which is watching the low flying airplanes above about to land at McCarren Airport a couple miles to the west. My favorite activity takes place indoors when I connect my laptop or phone to the outlet and go online watching YouTube while enjoying a cup of coffee.      Another thing that is not bitter is customer service. The employees have always been professional and attentive to the details of my caffeineated beverage.     Sunrise Coffee is one of the Many coffee house that I appreciate. I don't take living near Sunrise Coffee for granted. Just like the sun is guaranteed to return to sunset I am guaranteed to return to Sunrise.",

    "text": "I love sunrise coffee. I really do. My go to food is either the alien burrito or the egg on croissant breakfast sandwich. Delicious.  My issue is with the drive-through window. And, this is not the first time I've had this issue.  Am I wrong to expect at the drive-through will be priority service? Isn't the assumption that I'm driving through because I'm going somewhere? And therefore that I'm kind of in a hurry? If I have time to hang out, I would've come inside and eat delicious food off a real plate instead of out of a cardboard box. I'd be drinking my coffee out of a real mug, instead of out of a paper cup.  I pulled up to the window and ordered at 10:04. I pulled forward and waited. The guy came and took my payment. I waited some more. He came back a couple minutes later and gave me my coffee. I waited some more. And waited. And waited. And finally a different guy showed up and handed me my sandwich. No, \"Sorry it took so long,\" no \"I apologize for the wait.\" Just \"Waiting for your food? Here.\"  That was at 10:22. 18 minutes. During the normal course of my day, 18 minutes is no big deal. But sitting my car with the air conditioner on and the engine running and wasting gas, 18 minutes was enough to throw off the rest of my schedule before I had to be at my final destination.  Sunrise is cool, indeed. But perhaps, they should consider closing the drive-through window. They're certainly not meeting the expectations of what I think a drive-through window should be for. If you're going through provide drive-through service, than make it good. Otherwise you are just reduc by what should be a five star teview.   Update June 7: last two times through, Sunrise has redeemed themselves. There is a very nice young lady working the window who is exceedingly efficient and very polite. This morning, my time through the process was three minutes and part of that was the girl asking how my day was going so far. This is a HUGE difference and what I consider an ideal way to deliver great customer service. Thanks Sunrise. You box says \"Sunrise loves you.\" I'm beginning to feel it again!",

I did, and I was happy.    We also picked up a pound of their roasted coffee and we enjoyed our first pot of it at home this morning.

Personally, I head into this spot for a cool locale to open my laptop and grab a bite. I reside on planet earth, but my favorite grub is their Alien Burrito. A tortilla stuffed with hummus, quinoa, beans, avocado and all the goodness. It's fresh and filling. Totally hits the spot. I'd love the option to add bacon, but this is a vegetarian spot. I can deal.   The staff here is always super nice and full of energy. That's just what the caffeine doctor ordered when you're heading to a coffee spot.",

And I got, very very sick.  I kept blaming other things, thinking the other restaurants I was choosing were making me sick.  I was wrong.  I came in to eat today. They once again confirmed everything was dairy free.  I sat waiting to eat and when a women named Adriana came out and said \"sorry, the gluten free bread and the egg are cooked with dairy\".  I sat stunned. She gave me my money back, but she didn't even give me apology, just an excuse about how baristas don't know about the menu. She was visibly annoyed with me and apathetic to what I was trying to say. It was insulting in the highest degree.  This is a restaurant that advertises for people like me to eat there. Each time someone walked into the kitchen and confirmed,  I was safe to eat.  I don't like giving bad reviews, but I feel obligated to let others know who have food allergies like me that what they advertise is a lie. This kind of mistake is inexcusable.  Whatever dietary restrictions you have, whether you are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free, etc, It is not safe to eat here. Your preference will be disrespected. Your allergy ignored . Like me you could become very sick.  Quite simply Sunrise Coffee doesn't care about you. Go just about anywhere else.",

It was kind of out of the way, but I was happy we came here. There's an outside seating area with shade, which is a plus in the Vegas heat. Once we walked in, there was a long bar with coffee machines and offerings. The menu was definitely diverse, but I settled on a s'more iced latte. It wasn't too sweet and I really enjoyed it. I liked how they had different flavors for lattes because most places have the same ones over and over.  There is a lot of seating available inside and it didn't feel crowded at all. Three of us sat at a long, tall table in the center and people watched. The table itself had flowers on it and I thought that was a nice touch. It was interesting to see all kinds of different people float on through for their coffee or treat. Their one bathroom was clean and legit, which is always nice. One thing I noticed is how many people were behind the bar. Normally I see up to three maaaaybe four people, but I swear there were like six or seven people on top of each other and talking to each other. It looked a bit much and the person taking our order was distracted and didn't make any effort to connect with us. Other than that, I loved it!",

    "text": "Wow. I guess it's been a few years since I've visited Sunrise Coffee. I like what they've done with the place. Much more seating inside and a large covered patio outside.  I stopped by because I had run out of coffee beans. When I visited Colorado River Coffee Roasters a couple of years ago, they told me that Sunrise was no longer their customer because they started roasting their own beans. As it turns out, Sunrise will soon open up a separate location for their Mothership Coffee Roasters brand. But for now, you can buy the beans at Sunrise.  As I walk in, I see that they have four varieties available, but nothing specifically marked as an espresso blend. So I ask the guy for a recommendation. Long story short, I went with the Guatemala Cafe Femenino. It's organic, fair trade, and all women farmers? Interesting. Anyway, the latte I made this morning was absolutely delicious. Good job women farmers!  A nice touch was that my cup of cold brew coffee was on the house thanks to my purchase of beans. To top it off, their cold brew was perfectly tasty and refreshing.  It's definitely nice to have a quality local spot to grab freshly roasted beans. Sunrise Coffee and the upcoming Mothership Coffee Roasters just might be my new go to spots.",

I've explored lots of coffee shops around town and its hard for me to find a shop that has great coffee and provides quality food.   They have an interesting coffee selection, the pumpkin spice is better than most. I'm a Harry Potter fan, so I was delighted they make Butter Beer, I think it's only great cold, I would not recommend getting it as a hot latte. The Creme Brulee you just have to taste it to believe it.  The NomNom Burrito and the Chili with Three Beans burrito are both vegan friendly.  They taste delicious and I'm not even Vegan, but I enjoy it anyway.  The atmosphere is wonderful, it can get crowded inside, but never too busy that I couldn't find a place to sit. In general, it's an awesome place to do some work and/or socialize with your friends.  Highly recommend!!",

I usually get the croissant breakfast sandwich to go along with my morning coffee, and while it tastes amazing, it's a little messy. That's my only gripe with the sandwich. I look like a heathen eating this thing while there's crumbs and chunks of avocado falling all over me. If anything, I should just get this sandwich to-go so I can enjoy it without other people looking at me like I'm an animal or something.   Since I live nearby, I usually frequent Sunrise Coffee on the weekends to get some work done. It does get a little busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings with people just hanging out, getting some work done, or just enjoying some good coffee. If you decide to come here on weekend mornings, just be aware of that.  The workers are really great and enthusiastic. The best part about this cafe is the baristas that work there. Every time I go, I get great service, and everyone is really nice to me. It's what keeps me coming back time after time.  Overall: great coffee & great service",

All furniture is designed and made by the owner, talk about impressive and really caring for your business.  I am the type of person that can hang in relaxing space like this order a few drinks and snacks and handle my school and work biz so to find this gem is amazing.  The drinks are unmatched as far as flavor and attention to detail.  They really give a damn about each cup going out.  My favorite is always changing but recently I let May (very cute, fun and friendly barista working the espresso machine) hook me up with her own creation.  I hate sweet drinks however she put together a hazelnut marshmellow latte concogtion (special order, not on the menu) and it was PERFECT for a rainy day.  As far as food goes my favorite has to be the alien burrito (a sunrise classic) or the peanut butter banana granola crunch sandwhich- not your average peanut butter sandwhich let me tell you (not the official name, but you get it).  If you havent been slap yourself and then hurry up and get there ...like now!",

We went to Vegas with my family-- and we knew that there weren't very many vegan options in there, but did a little bit of research and found Sunrise Coffee. We had breakfast there and had a lovely experience.  The staff was super friendly--they seemed they were happy at their work place-- and the atmosphere was so chill, healthy and Eco-conscious! I had the \"Tofurky (vegan) 'which\" and my husband had the \"Granola Happy for my Tummy\". Mmmm!!! I was in love.   Because I am trying to get my parents to eat healthier, I took them each a vegan \"Nom Nom Burrito\" and \"Tofurky 'Which\". They absolutely loved it and the next day we all went there to eat breakfast again. My parents were so happy to eat healthy and fresh after being out in the casinos for 2 nights in a row.  I love how Sunrise Coffee has VEGAN options, sells fair trade coffee, and has Eco-conscious messages and plates, forks, napkins and cups. As I mentioned, the staff is so friendly and give lost of smiles. What a great place to eat and hang out! Next time we  go to Vegas we will be stopping by there for breakfast again!",

Las Vegas.  (Miss you, Sunrise!)",

Another two minutes later, my burrito was done and I went to sit outside. They didn't call a name with it, but I just took it and assumed it was for me since no one else claimed it.   About 15-20 minutes later, I was 75% done with my burrito when an employee comes out and calls my name. I ignore it, thinking that the burrito can't be for me since I already grabbed mine from the front counter. Five minutes later, she comes out and calls my name AGAIN. So I finally tell her, \"Um, I already grabbed this one 20 minutes ago and I thought it was for me. There wasn't a name so I just took it.\" She gave me a WTF look and went back inside.  Really? Why would you put a name to a Nom Nom burrito and not the other one? I even heard her say to another customer, \"We put all the customer's names in Sriracha on their plate!\" I would've been waiting 20 minutes for a small, overpriced burrito that was ACTUALLY mine. They need to ask for EVERY customer's name from now on so confusions like this don't happen.",

I like the feel of this coffee joint because the people are friendly the drinks are great and it's not corporate like other coffee shops.  I ordered a half soy/rice latte that came out better than I expected and I'll definitely come back for another one of those. It was refreshing to find another milk alternative beside the normal alternative which is usually soy.  The coffee itself was smooth and not bitter and my drink ended up being almost $4 which isn't that bad considering a Starbucks latte usually cost about the same.  I would have tried their green tea but everything green they had on the menu no longer existed so I opted for a latte. Whenever I'm back in town I'll be giving this little gem of a coffee joint another try.  Hooray for SC!!!",

Hanging out in a coffee shop is a requirement for anyone living in Seattle, so I've grown to appreciate the art of spending a few hours relaxing in a local shop. I should immediately confess that I am not a coffee drinker, but I can appreciate a good cup of tea. Upon entering Sunrise it was immediately apparent that it could easily be located in Seattle. It is very inviting, there are couches, a bar, a patio, and a bookcase. There are delicious looking pastries and lunch options as well. All of the coffee drinkers that I have visited with really loved their drinks, particularly the Nutella latte. I appreciate their tea selection and also the caffeine free menu (I was very recently pregnant and needed some caffeine free options). My favorite caffeine free option is the homemade horchata, who would have thought?   The staff is always really friendly and patient. I also love the tip jar, there are usually two choices and you put your two cents (hopefully more) in the jar that you most identify with - for example - Star Wars vs. Star Trek. So creative and definitely encourages tipping!   If you are looking for some yummy treats and a relaxing coffee shop environment, this should be your go-to Vegas coffee shop!",

I ordered a quiche & a Nutella iced Latte. For those who know me, I'm very particular about my Nutella iced lattes. When I received my drink it tasted like hazelnut and chocolate, which, I found out, was exactly what it was. I didn't like it and was able to swap it out for a Mexican Iced Latte. This was a little better, but again, I guess I have higher expectations for how my drinks taste.   I also noticed that many other customers received their drinks in a jar, but I received mine in a plastic cup. I don't mind too much, but I'd much rather have mine in a drinking mug or mason jar to avoid using plastic.   The quiche was yummy, but cold; the girl I ordered from mentioned she would microwave it, but it came to me still cold. No big deal, it was still edible :)   I loved sitting outside though! There is a really nice shaded area with plants and it's a super cute spot to take pictures at also! Plus the fresh air felt great!",

    "text": "Sunrise was just as I imagined it to be. Hipster & cute at it's finest. The indoor space seemed bigger online than it did in person but nonetheless there was a fair amount of seating inside and outside. It had a nice aesthetic inside, simple, clean, and sleek. Easy on the eyes and inviting! Their menu was simple yet still hard to choose from. I debated between the Hot Mess bowl and the Nom Nom breakfast burrito and the Hot Mess bowl won. The Hot Mess bowl consisted of potatoes, eggs, bell peppers, sour cream, spinach, eggs, tomato, and cholula sauce with a slice of toast. It was flavorful and filling. The potatoes were nicely cooked and seasoned. It was definitely something that I could whip up myself, but for $8 I will gladly pay for convenience sake. I washed my meal down with their Strawberry Jasmine lemonade. Clearly, based on my picture's caption I didn't know what I was drinking LOL but that's beside the point. IT WAS DELISH! It was so refreshing and light. I feel like the Jasmine tea helped calm the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the strawberry, making a beautiful menage trois of flavors in your mouth.   Considering that this wonderful discovery of mine is on the complete opposite side of town from me, I would be more than happy to take the journey back just to have a taste of their other food and drink items. The staff was accommodating and the service was fairly fast. The day I went there was a sign up that food order would take 15 minutes or so to be made but I didn't even notice the time. I highly recommend this little coffee/breakfast shop, it is worth the try! Enjoy :)",

The latte's are creamy and go perfectly well with the pistachio \"whooping pie.\" I also love bringing out my inner kid with their PB&J and Banana sandwich.  This is definitely the spot to go if you need to get some work done, or to just have a chat with some friends. I love that they have a nice covered outdoor patio area that feels surprisingly comfortable despite being in a strip mall. Sunset Park is across the street, so the outdoor patio almost has a park-like feel to it.",

They use their sister stores beans (Mothership) which are responsibly sourced and roasted locally which is a definite plus. I like to bring colleagues here for work meetings and they all end up loving it! They have a great patio to sit and sip your coffee and chat with friends. They are under the flight path so if you're sitting outside the occasional plane likes to jet over and make sure the coffee is doing its job waking you up, but aside from that it's an awesome spot! Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!",

The food is always on point, the coffee isn't bitter, and it's a great place to get some work done. There can sometimes be a line, but it moves fast.   My most recent visit to Sunrise included an Alien Burrito. This coffeehouse favorites' full name is, \"ALIENS LEFT A BURRITO IN THE MIDDLE EAST\" according to their website. Not only is that a mouthful, but also is a delicious vegetarian delight. Which is filled with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell pepper, ranch, and wrapped up in a tomato tortilla. Out-of-this-world good., too much?   I've tried a few other things here like; the Multigrain Egg Which, the Breakfast Croissant sandwich, and the PBJ Nutella concoction which is orgasmic. There are all fantastic! Like I said, this place is constantly good and always puts a food fueled smile on my face.   This being a coffee based spot, of course I've tried their caffeinated beverages and they are beyond the normal range of coffee perfection. My go to is still the Iced Americano, but I like no frills or sugar in my coffee. K.I.S.S baby!   PRO TIP: In a rush? Avoid the beanie-wearing hipsters, who are on a cliche filled road to hell, and hit up the drive-thru.",

    "text": "I've been by here numerous times but never stopped in. I finally decided to check it out on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. The parking lot is always full here. There's the coffee shop, a tattoo place, and Table Thai restaurant.  The outside windows are heavily painted, so you can't really see inside. When I walked in I was surprised to see the place about 80% full with people and their laptops. Its much bigger inside than I imagined, as well as having an outdoor patio. Now I know why the parking lot is always full....I always thought it was people going across the street to Sunset Park.   The staff was friendly and patient with me because I'm not a coffee snob, and I just wanted a iced coffee, preferably a mocha. The lady explained a couple of my options and I went with the cold brewed version with a little bit of cream and white mocha flavor. The coffee was smooth, no bitterness, and needed no additional adds. Delicious!!!!  This is definitely Hipster central. Almost every guy in here was sporting a beard, checkered shirt, and jeans...even on a hot afternoon. Most looked like they had never seen the sun. I don't know about you, but when the temperature is above 80, you will find me only in shorts, flip flops, and a nice comfortable lightweight shirt. It wasn't like the coffee shop was A/C'd down to 70. I just find this a bit....strange. Almost like \"Hey lets go to the coffeeshop\" \"OK, I'll get my hipster wardrobe on and we can go\" LOL. Now don't get all offended, this is just a simple observation. I only saw one other guy wearing shorts out of 20.   Another observation is that other than their own group or partner, no one even looks at anyone else. They are either buried in their laptop or other device. No smiles, no human interaction. Its the exact opposite of a bar/saloon atmosphere.  The coffee is good. They feature some Mothership Roaster blends as well. They have a drive thru. Prices didn't seem too bad, my small iced coffee came out to $2.32.",

    "text": "A few friends and I decided to head here to grab a coffee, maybe some food, and talk for a bit because they love this joint. So, being a lover of trying new spots, I agreed!  The location has a fairly decent amount of parking in front and around the building, which is great for when you want to meet people for a coffee.   Walking into the building it's what I expected a coffee shop to look like. Dark rich walls, lots of different sized tables to accommodate 2 people and a few for larger parties or studying and a lounge-y area near the front for more comfortable group seating. There is also a small patio to the side which is where we sat. Provides more room for bigger parties and extra seating for days when it's a bit packed (such as today). What I love about the patio is that it's somewhat covered with a vine like wall on one side shielding some sunlight, but also let's in small patches through the vine and the sides. It's pretty open which makes the place seem bigger than it may appear I be outside.   As for the service, the lady at the counter was very welcoming and provided great suggestions for types of drinks, and the food they serve. (They do have Vegan options and their menu seems pretty healthy without lacking flavor which I enjoy). I had even started with ordering a latte first (in which there are a BUNCH of flavors) and then went back to order food after seeing other tables around us with good food and bakery items in front of them.   A plus in which most people come for is the latte art that they do on top of their hot lattes and sometimes on other hot drinks as well. Each latte art is different so expect a something unique each time :) mine happened to be a cute kitty face, while my friend's was a sweet dinosaur looking thing (once again...it was unique. It could've been a snail. I don't know LOL)  while earlier another friend got a flower.   Overall, good atmosphere, friendly service, and the lattes, bakery items, and cafe foods are delicious. I recommend coming in and trying a couple things with friends!",

The treats they sell are all vegan, but taste sooo good! One of my favorite things to get there is the croissant egg sandwich! It's a croissant with this vegan mayo, spinach, tomato, avocado, cheese, and eggs! Delicious!!!",

I love this place a-latte ;) My go to drinks are the French vanilla lattes, hazelnut lattes, & sometimes I take a little spin on the wild side and order some tea. You can't go wrong with either going inside or going to drive through. The baristas are great either way and my drink always comes out perfect! The coffee isn't overwhelmingly sweet neither is it too light on coffee. Their little cubed crunchy ice adds the perfect touch to an iced lattes. Refreshing guys! Come get your coffee here!",

    "text": "So the trouble I am having with writing this review today is that the actual behind the counter staff here is fantastic, and the food/coffee is pretty high quality as well. Today, apparently the management / owners are here conducting some kind of business, and the back kitchen is having an orientation. I was sitting at one of the larger tables along with a few other people who had wandered in alone to study or whatnot. The rest of the people had left when one of the managers walked past my table and dropped her bag on top of it loudly, as if to claim her space. I didn't know what she was doing because she walked away but a few minutes later called over her orientees and told them to sit down. Having them sit down at the table meant that I needed to move all of my stuff. She made no acknowledgement that I was sitting there nor did she ask if I minded or anything of the sort, which is something I would expect of someone in management at their establishment. (just as a quick background I have worked many years in the service industry) Never would any establishment I have worked in push customers out of their way to conduct an orientation; and if absolutely necessary would not do so without acknowledgment or accommodation. After 20 minutes of my trying to study for an exam and her speaking loudly over me, I decided to get up and move. Again...no acknowledgment. There is one other larger table in the middle of the restaurant where the \"owners\" I believe are sitting. Their energy is horrible, and I keep seeing the blonde owner get frustrated, and it keeps sounding like they argue about money. Look, none of that is my concern. What I am concerned about is that I chose today to take my daughters to preschool and pay the $50 for school, and than to come and spend $20 on coffee because I was committing myself to today to study as hard as i could for my nursing boards next week. It doesn't matter that it was close to my last $20, all they care about is that the seats are full and that we are spending our money to keep their establishment up and running. Again, my apologies to the baristas and front staff they are wonderful; but if this truly is the ownership/management of this establishment, they won't be getting any more of my money.",

They're conveniently located next to Enterprise where I dropped off my rental and so I definitely didn't have an excuse to not visit them. Tea latte's are perfect for chilly nights, so I ordered myself a large jasmine tea latte -- DELICIOUS!   I'm pretty bummed that I visited them around the evening time, as they don't really serve dinner specials, but definitely visiting again for lunch... because Alien Burrito.   The ambiance of the place is great! Place has good seating, they don't blast out their music, and you can actually hear what people are saying to you! Aside from the great atmosphere and the tea latte I ordered, their staff is great and I'll definitely come back here!   Oh right, I forgot... I also ordered their blueberry muffin and it was divine.   /cozy feeling/",

It was delicious and really filling with a lot of fresh tasting ingredients. The avocado was green, the lettuce was crunchy. I know that sounds silly but I hate consuming food that tastes like it has been there a while. Coffee was delicious, and tasted very strong and very fresh.   3. The atmosphere was really relaxing and there was plenty of seating outside- under a shade. I got a very California vibe from this place, very laidback and chill.

The ambiance it very much more old school and local coffee shop, giving you the option to drink out of actual coffee mugs instead if to go cups.  This is very much a touch that makes all the difference when everyone is always in a rush to get their coffee fix.  Sunrise gives you and opportunity to just enjoy your beverage and relax.

Their staff was super friendly and nice too.  Too bad the coffee didn't live up to expectations. The latte I got was OK, but nothing better than what Starbucks could have whipped up.  The sugar free chai latte was watery and bland. It tasted like ice coffee that has been left out for a few hours.  That being said, the coffee shop wasn't that bad.

I have never had a cup of coffee, tea, chai (yeah I know it's tea), water, or anything else here that wasn't top notch. If I were in Las Vegas more I would be here more... when I provide gifts to co-workers it's usually a gift card for these guys.

They have great coffee and a nice selection of breakfast and lunch options (including vegan). The inside is really clean and inviting and the staff are super friendly, helpful, and cool. Plus they make a great latte. I chatted a bit and then enjoyed my breakfast and latte while reading. There are plenty of tables and comfortable chairs to relax in.

In a town awash with Starbucks (isn't every town now?) it is such a relief to find somewhere different.   Had a perfectly good black coffee and a really good vegan nom-nom breakfast burrito. Happy to see somewhere that not only has vegan options (great for those of us with dairy issues), but has really interesting options as well. All the pastries looked really good, too. The staff is definitely rocking the indie coffeehouse vibe, but they are surprisingly friendly and fast. I am clearly jaded from my years of living in Portland.  The main issue I see with this place is that it appears to be too successful for its own britches. The interior is pretty small and although they have made the most of the space with tables, chairs and a communal seating area, it just isn't enough. When I was there the place was packed both inside and on the outdoor patio, with no free seating anywhere. So many people in one small space made it feel a bit claustrophobic and you could hear everyones conversations. If the space issue could somehow be remedied without losing the charm of the place this would be the ideal study spot.",

In terms of quality of ingredients, this is probably the number one coffee shop in town.   This is the perfect place for vegans, organic food eaters and all around liberal/ super accepting folks. The establishment is very particular about using fair trade and organic items and most of their food items are vegan based. The staff is very friendly and more then willing to explain the preparation, origin, or flavor of any item on the menu.  It's also a great place the study. The music is excellent and most of the stuff they play is mellow. You're bound to see at least one person on a macbook studying intently in the corner.

They have vegetarian And Vegan options if that makes a difference for you.  They also have vegan pastries available.  From 5pm to 8pm they sell it for $1.   People raved about the alien burrito so I had ordered that and couldn't resist having a frappe mint mocha.  As I wait for my food order the nice cashier came to my table to deliver my frappe .    I nearly drank all my mint mocha, it was delightful on this hot day.  Alien Burritto when I finally had it when I brought it to the office, it did not disappoint! Beans, quinoa, cheese, red bell peppers, lots of rolled lettuce. It was very flavorful without any meat!  Very cozy atmosphere, it's the artsy coffee shop you usually would find in LA.  Sunset coffee you will see me again :)",

You'll bump into your typical coffeehouse crowd: hipsters, intellectuals, and people-trying-to-look-busy-on-their-macbooks.  The young lady who took our order was a sweetie pie and the rest of the staff was efficient :)  I indulged in a Mexican Mocha and my partner had a White Chocolate Latte and both were delicious! Latte Art is standard with all their drinks and ours looked like shit but we weren't trippin' about it. I would've taken a picture but I don't think a lot of people would find abstract, nonrepresentational art appealing on their latte.  If I was a local, I'd come here regularly!",

My only complaint is that they play the music a little loud sometimes. It is good music typically though. Also, they need a bigger shop. Apparently others feel like I do because the place is always packed. Every time I am here their regulars come in and talk to the employees for a long time.

Got the Yelp special mocha frappe (vegan, with soy).  Awesomeness points - they don't charge extra for soy (or rice) milk! (You can also get almond milk for a bit extra.)  Ordered the tofurkey sandwich (veganized - tofurkey, vegan cheez, tomato, spinach, red bell pepper, hummus on whole grain bread) and my friend got the An Alien Left a Burrito in the Middle East (hehehe), veganized - spinach tortilla w/ beans, vegan cheese, hummus, couscous, and veggies.  I had a bite and it was nummers! I'm gonna get that next time for sure.   They also have a black bean sandwich (not veganizable) and breakfast items (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito!).  Reasonably priced coffee drinks, lots of teas (including a very tasty local organic \"Summer Orchard\").  Very friendly staff, and we got our food and drinks really quickly.  Was surprised at how inexpensive it was, bonus!   Looks like it would be a fun place to hang out with a few friends on one of the sofas (they had several board games).   The only disappointment was the vegan brownie; not bad -- just tasted too \"healthy.\"  Guessing it was sweetened with dates? Which is cool if you're looking for natural sugar, but I like my vegan desserts to taste like junk food. :)  Will be coming here on the regular from now on!",

    "text": "I recently moved to Las Vegas from Orange County, CA. Having lived there my whole life, I had grown accustomed to fine coffee mini-chains like Peet's Coffee & Tea, Deidrich Coffee, and more recently, Kean Coffee.  The aforementioned establishments go out of their way to deliver a competitive product to consumers without insulting the tradition of coffee. Every other national chain I've ever been to utterly fails to do so.  Thus, when I moved to Las Vegas and was deprived of the local coffee shops I had come to love, I quickly set about trying to find something to replace them. Las Vegas, having the reputation that it does for fine dining, would surely have dozens of high-end coffee shops that employed a skilled barista or two... or so I thought.  I've lived here for about 6 months at the time of this writing, and Sunrise Coffee is the *only* place in this town where I can get decent coffee. On top of that, they use Klatch Coffee, roasted by a family from Southern California whose reputation I know well.  Their staff is friendly, their baristas' skills are competition-grade, and they play excellent music. Free Wi-Fi and plenty of seating and power outlets make this place a great hang-out as well.  If there's one thing I could suggest to the proud owner of Sunrise Coffee, it would be this:  Please open a store in the northwest-ish part of town! Driving 25 miles for your coffee is worth it, but getting to be quite expensive!",

Based on other reviews, this was about the only place that seemed like they might have a decent brew available. Lo and behold, they did! I've had better, sure, but this is a MUCH better option than the corporate giants. As per my usual order, I just got a coffee with room and added my own cream. Considering I was actually able to pick out real flavors from the coffee, I'd call this a win. The only bad part was having to wait for them to actually brew it, but considering they offerred me a free drink card for waiting, all I got from that experience is that they actually care about making customers happy.  The only reason this is a 4/5 review instead of a perfect score is that the coffee was good but not great; that's pretty much the whole reason. Anyway, next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely come back here for my brew.",

    "text": "After reading raving reviews about this coffee shop I decided to give it a try.   First off I have to admit that I DON'T like coffee. With that being said I was taking a risk, and possibly opting for a smoothie or tea once I arrived. I went with my younger sister, and although she is only 10 years old, she loves coffee.  As soon as I walked in I noticed all the tables and chairs were taken except for one. That meant it was a to-go order for me! Everyone was busy doing something, reminded me of an actual coffee shop, like the ones you see in movies. I really liked it.   I felt like such a newbie! I ordered a Creme Brulee Latte and my sister order a Caramel Vanilla latte iced. We also ordered the Alien burrito. Out of my excitement to try this coffee I forgot to order it with soy milk instead of regular, being I am lactose intolerant. Luckily I had my pills with me!  Hurray! The food and coffee was ready in minutes. As soon as I took a sip of coffee I realized how much I now loved coffee... well, at least from Sunrise Coffee! My sister's latte was just as delicious! Ah I can't explain the amazing-ness.   The burrito was where I was a bit stunned. I had read raving reviews, but when I tasted it... it felt like it was missing something. Like salt or meat? I am not a vegetarian or vegan therefore I usually like meat. It was still worth a try. As soon as I got home I added extra avocado, salt, more vegetables. I didn't like the fact I had to fix it up a bit myself, but the taste itself was much better afterwards. I love vegetables maybe I can ask for more if I ever decide to order it again, but I most likely won't. On the plus side, might I mention how healthy and guilt-free I felt afterwards?!   I will definitely be back for the coffee and possibly try some newfood items on the menu.",

You have to wait at least 5 minutes for them to prepare the food since it's made fresh and it costs about $6.50, but it's definitely well worth the wait.

I'm vegan, and I am a regular customer as I usually stop by a couple times a week on my way to class in the morning to get my coffee and bagel fix. I'll start by saying that their coffee, tea, and vegan food/pastries are delicious. They have the most amazing pumpkin spice latte, which is what I get almost every time, along with an everything bagel (all of their bagel flavors are awesome) with vegan cream cheese, and sometimes one of their vegan pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. I am never disappointed with my order.  Also, more importantly, the service at Sunrise Coffee is phenomenal. Every single employee there works hard, always has a smile on their face, and they are all some of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a food establishment before. In fact, I stopped by today on my way to class, and drive-thru service is always very quick and efficient, but today it took a just a little bit longer than usual (which was TOTALLY okay with me, it was no problem at all). I already had my coffee and pastry, I was just waiting on my bagel, and as soon as the kind woman working the drive-thru opened the window, she immediately apologized for the wait (which was not even long), and proceeded to hand me a free drink coupon for next time. That was totally not necessary for them to do as they did not inconvenience me in any way, but it was so generous and sweet of them to do that for me. I've never seen an employee express a genuine concern towards a customer at a Starbucks or any other coffee shop like I did today at Sunrise Coffee.  Thanks to Sunrise Coffee for all the great service and food! More people need to know about them. Check them out, you won't regret it. Especially all the vegans and vegetarians.",

I moved to Vegas from San Francisco and was so disappointed that there was nowhere to go for coffee besides Starbucks and Coffee Bean.. and It's a Grind, but I can't do their prices or location.  Sunrise is the bomb. I've had black coffee, lattes, and smoothies. All were awesome. I highly recommend the Caramel Latte.  Their customer service is also fantastic. One time they took a little long to make my drink and they gave me a coupon for a free drink the next time I came. And it was ANY drink free, not just a small coffee or something.   Super clean facility and friendly staff, not snobby or stuck up at all. There are always tons of people reading, chillin' on their laptops, and knitting.   I love this place and would recommend it to anyone.   Sunrise is by far my favorite coffee shop in Vegas!",

    "text": "Going from chain to chain of coffee joints became tiresome for me. Thus, I was looking for a more local place to head out to. Lo and behold, word of mouth led me to Sunrise Coffee.  I can hardly call myself a coffee or tea connoisseur. I drink this stuff for the caffeine. Even if it tends to taste terrible (e.g. Starbucks coffee), I still down it like it I need it to live. If it happens to taste good, then props to the drink. My brain and taste buds both become happy.   Upon walking in, I happened to notice signs indicating they sell products that are of free trade and organic.These aren't absolutely necessary qualities for me when looking for a beverage, but I appreciate that it's what I'm getting. It was a blistering hot day outside, so I went with a simple iced peach tea, unsweetened. It was very refreshing, with a light hint of that peach flavor. The medium size tends to run a bit small for my tastes. Luckily, their prices aren't too bad. Getting a large wouldn't hurt for the next time I drop by.    The coffee shop itself is a nice place to be in. It keeps itself subtle and music choices are very easy to listen to. I primarily went here to study, so the music is easy to tune out when my face is in my book. The couch they have there is incredibly comfortable. I could sit my buns on this thing for hours, essentially great for a study grind. There are plenty of outlets available, with free wifi as well. t's a pleasant place to be.   I wouldn't drive long distances to get to this place, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely drop by.",

Much better than Starbucks I am sure, but after going here twice I was disappointed and yearned to go home even more. The first latte the beans were burned and the barista pulled the shot with water that was to cold (bc it was sour) and the second latte the beans were roasted far to long. They do have all compostable materials and roast onsite, which saves on environmental costs (a breathe of fresh air for Las Vegas) but they only get two stars from me in coffee- what should be their shining star of delight.",

I had already had my morning coffee so I opted for an almond milk chai (thank you for carrying more nondairy alternatives than just soy) and a poppy seed muffin.  No complaints about the wifi.

The coffee is always of the highest quality, probably because the co-owner is a bit o.c.d. about the quality of his drinks.

Sorry for the caps, I just love this place that much. It's a bummer, I don't live close by.   First of all, I love that they are strong supporters/advocates of fair trade. Second of all, I'm not sure if it's always like this but when I first stepped in, it was DEAD QUIET. Luckily, I loved it since I had some studying to do! A great place to chat but a even greater place to get work done! The ambience is intimate with a hint of hipster. (:   I ordered the creme brulee latte with stevia, almond milk, and sugar-free syrups. DELICIOUS! It tasted like a good ol' creme brulee latte with a deeper taste of almond milk (my fave). As I sat to get work done, I later got hungry & thirstier and ordered the vegan alien burrito with the veganaise (vegan mayonnaise) on the side. It was perfect: fresh, clean, AVOCADO-EY, crispy, delicious! The iced peach tea I got was also a great way to cool off in the suffocatingly horrible Vegas weather!   I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone. The only thing that I would have preferred is for them to expand the space a little! When I entered, there was almost nowhere to sit down! Will definitely frequent this place as much as possible before going back to school!",

I wanted a macaron, but he wasn't sure what all the flavors were, and we were both only knew that the green ones were definitely pistachio, so that's what I ordered. When I got to the window, the girl handed me three macarons and my coffee. The man from the speaker came to the window and apologized for not knowing what the rest of the macarons were. They were both super nice and helpful. Awesome, awesome customer service here (and great coffee too)!",

Although I would do a major overhaul on the signage outside and the interior. Make it look more inviting.  Vegan muffin was great! Moist & rich with blueberry deliciousness. Had a breakfast wrap with extra spinach and was quite satisfied. Great coffee too... YAY ALMOND MILK!   Overall YAY! But really---- she's clean, but if you want people to hang out for a bit... make it a bit more cozy.",

    "text": "This place is definitely the type of coffee shop that I prefer.  I'm kind of a tea snob, and it's the first thing I like to look at when going to new coffee/tea places. I was happy to see that they served loose leaf tea. I like to 'test' places when they serve loose leaf tea, by ordering one of their selections of green tea or white tea. They have my favorite tea, Genmaicha [green tea with toasted rice], so I ordered that. When I received it, I was happy to find that they had not burnt it or over steeped it. Yay. The only thing that bothered me was their black tea. It simply states 'black tea.' That's definitely one of my biggest pet peeves in any establishment. I want to know what type of tea I'm drinking, not simply if it's black,green, white, etc.  I also ordered their breakfast burrito. They way they described it to me sounded super delicious. Eggs,beans,tomatoes,spinach,potatoes, and probably a couple other items that are escaping my mind right now. It was an alright burrito. It was pretty big which was nice. The thing I didn't like about it was that none of the ingredients were really incorporated with one another. As I said, the burrito was pretty big - so every time I went to take a bite of it it was either just all potato, or all spinach, or all beans. There was also very little egg in the burrito, which was disappointing because when I think of breakfast burritos, I picture the main thing in it as egg.  I haven't tried any of their coffee drinks, but my friend did and loved their latte with french vanilla and hazelnut in it. I probably wouldn't make the 20 minute drive to that side of town just to go to this place. But, it's definitely somewhere I'll return to when I am in the area. Service was great, and the shop is cute, just a little too far for me [especially with gas prices now. =p]",

I'm kind of picky about the coffeeshops I work in--but this definitely hit all the requirements for a great work spot. Plenty of outlets, free wifi, breakfast sandwich offerings, mellow music, big windows for natural lighting, ample table space, bookshelves to stimulate the brain, and of course, delicious coffee.  The hazelnut latte I ordered was divine. Not too sweet, not too nutty and topped with the perfect amount of foam. I hung out there for hours with a friend. Ended up staying right up til closing, when they offered us free pumpkin chocolate muffins and croissants. Magical!",

To start off, the food is good (see excited remarks above) and the drinks are yumz.  I usually opt for a nice latte to go with my alien/nom burrito and usually stick around for a little bit to people watch/read/hangout.  The staff seems to be a bit smug at times but I do go out of my way to converse so I don't really mind much.  Also, they have vegan treats available and it's a nice change of pace in comparison to all the other eats in the area.  Definitely one of my favorite coffee places and I'm pretty sure I'll be continuing to frequent this joint if I'm in the relative area.  BEWARE!! Sundays are super busy so expect to wait for a chair/sofa to open up if you plan to cruise by on this day!",

Located along Sunset between Eastern and Pecos you'll find Sunrise Coffee. A coffee shop sporting a 4.5 star rating and nearly 600 reviews. When you enter you'll see that it's a nice functional coffee shop, indoor seating, outdoor seating, nice place for study sessions or enjoy the morning newspaper.  I hear people raving about their food they sure do look good but so far I haven't tried them. I've only been here for their drinks. As it goes for the drinks they have a good selection of styles and flavors however, of those I've tried, they weren't at good as the coffee shop I use to go. They're decent somewhat lacking the flavor I was expecting. I've had a few of their lattes Mexican mocha, pumpkin spice, nutella, and a few frappes green tea and caramel. Nothing really stood out.  Customer service was ok nothing bad or great about it. Prices weren't to bad seemed cheaper than the other place. Cool place to checkout. I'll try their food soon. Drinks occasionally.",

Lots of times coffee joints use an ingredient for menu sounding sake and then you get a wimpy dose of it!  Not this place- its legit!    The place is large with lots of indoor & outdoor seating!

They have some vegan options on their menu which is something I can really appreciate (wraps and salads). They also have vegan muffins, smore bites, brownies, and other pastries. Their coffee drinks are pretty delicious. My favorite is the hot Mexican mocha (don't order this blended... It's way too sweet). And my favorite blended is just 3 shots of espresso with sugar free vanilla and almond milk. The orange mocha is also pretty awesome hot. Their chocolate is vegan and it is so great! They have an excellent patio that's always looks pretty busy. It's a great place to study or just meet up with friends. Over all it's one of my favorite coffee houses in Vegas!",

Even more excitingly, their baked goods also had several vegan options among them, and I chose the vanilla cardamom muffin, which was so sweet and delicious! The cashier was very helpful and pleasant while helping me determine which baked goods I could get.  I also got a London Fog (they have tea lattes!), and it was incredible! Even at 7 AM on a Saturday morning, there was a decently long line, so that should say something about their ability to draw a crowd, as well.  I can't believe I didn't know about this sooner, as I'm so excited to return and try more things off their menu! They also have plenty of seating for those who want to take advantage of the coffee shop atmosphere for studying, and even with the bustle, the noise level doesn't exceed the sound of drinks being prepared.  The decor is cute and professional, so it's a cozy place to settle in for a couple hours! So glad I was brought here!",

    "text": "Had a short-wait before an appointment near this intersection, so finally had a chance to check out this venue.  The atmosphere here is \"alternative, intellectual, independent.\" A young man sat down on one side of me and opened his bookmarked copy of Plato's Republic. The entire vibe was as if this shop was just down the street from the Cal Berkley campus. What it's doin' just down the street from McCarran Runway 26Left is anyone's guess. Point being if you wanna feel cool, go to Starbucks. If you ARE cool, go here.  Customer service was downright bubbly-friendly. Once I coughed up my first name for the order, you'd thought I was a every-day drop-in. Everyone shouted \"bye\" to me, by name, when I went out the door. Even though the place was packed.  The seating is tight. I felt as if I was on a menage-a-trois date with the two attractive young women sitting on the other side of me, me buried deep in their conversation. Alas, they were probably on a date of their own. There's some outdoor patio seating; it was also packed. If you are down for a shot of coffee-stranger-mingling with your shot of espresso at 9am on a weekday, this is your spot.  I ordered what they called a nom-nom breakfast burrito. It was huge, it was only $8 and it had avocado and sour cream ... so I guess the rest of the ingredients don't even matter. To make matters ever better, I was told it was their tenth anniversary so coffee and desert was on the house. Cha-ching! The desert was a sample-nibble of their blueberry scone. Yum! All the food I saw traveling about looked just as tasty.  No reason not to recommend this coffee shop ... so long as this is the kind of java-vibe you are looking for. Their sibling shop, Mothership, is a bit closer to home, so even though I drive by THIS shop on an almost daily basis, I'll have to land the Mothership to discover what kind of karma-aura it throws.",

One of my favorite summer drinks from Starbucks is a matcha frap with no whip or syrup and a shot of espresso. Being that it was snowing back home and 80 in Vegas, I felt this would be perfect and ordered the iced matcha latte with espresso. Unfortunately I think it was sans the espresso and a little to sweet and creamy for my taste.   While I was waiting for my friend to order, I browsed the coffee bags for purchase. I was disappointed to find that they didn't have a single bag of anything dark roasted.   Side note, I thought it was interesting that they had a photo of Michelle Obama visiting their shop. It was very off the beaten path and not that exciting that I wouldn't expect a First Lady to stop there.",

Im all about presentation and taste and I ordered an Iced vanilla bean latte, which form their yelp photos, they usually come in glass. However, I received a plastic cup with straws, which i was trying to avoid as well. They even asked me if it was for there or to go.   It was extremely sweet and creamy so i went back up and asked for an extra shot in it, willing to pay, but they charged me for an expresso (2.75) instead of a simple add shot (0.65). Drink basically came out to almost 7$ for a small latte.   The indoor environment is super cute and the staff is nice. Lots of seating and great for getting work done. Access to plugs as well. The outdoor seating is extremely beautiful and full of greenery! Excellent vibes. Friendly staff as well.",

You must ask the items to be made vegan and the menu clearly marks which options they allow it for. The staff is always friendly and the coffee is seriously yummy.   They have a cute small covered patio that is also dog friendly so bring your fur friends. Last time I visited I was grabbing food and coffee to go.

Mushroom tartlette with balsamic vinegar, lemon blueberry scone, and more.

They had specialty coffee drinks with fun flavors and delicious food!

    "text": "I seriously love this place. Like I wish it were a person so I could date the ish out it and then propse and marry it.  Five very big stars. My husband and I came across this place on our way to an early movie at Galaxy Green Valley last Saturday. We did our due diligence and scoped the place out on yelp and their website.  I knew immediately that I wanted to try their Candy Cane Latte being that I am a big fan of anything minty. I usually just like drip coffee but I was feeling fancy. The coffee shop itself was just marvelous. I loved the empty frames hanging from the wall. I was a big fan of the varied seating options available: comfy chairs, tables, pub style- tables and stools. Plus the cool enclosed patio outside and the eclectic collection of books to read on the shelf. My husband ordered the Mexican mocha and when we both received our drinks, a little bit of magic happened. Every sip was just awesome. I loved and appreciated the latte art. I loved the perfect ratio of foam and steamed milk. I loved the perfect hint of mint. I loved the mug that the latte was in. I loved every single thing about my drink. My husband wanted me to try his (he loved it too), but I would have to share some of mine and I wasn't willing to do that so I told him I'd just take him at his word. :)  20 oz later, I decided, I'm going to order ANOTHER drink. This time I tried the Nutella latte. The husband also decided to get another drink and he picked a hazelnut latte. Again, it was another 20 oz of loveliness. It had this great bite to it - it was different but perfect.  So, 40 ounces later, I was feeling quite content with myself. I would have loved to try the wraps or a pastry, and I will next time - but I had a lunch date planned so I stuck to just 2 LARGE mugs of wonderful.  For any coffee aficionado, for all latte lovers city-wide, I must say that Sunrise Coffee is as charming as they come. The staff was super friendly, the place was spotless, but most importantly, their was a piece of pride made in every mug there.  Highly recommend times infinity.",

Even though I've only had the nutella espresso, I can almost guarantee everything else is just as good. First off, this isn't your watered down weak coffee, it is strong and concentrated coffee which is how it is supposed to be. The nutella topped off the espresso just right. I love how they offer different flavors and also how you can choose your own milk. The selection is endless! I would have to compare this place to Sambalatte except its a little cheaper and less crowded. If you're in the neighborhood, give Sunrise a try! You won't ever go back to Starbucks ever again!",

This place is a great place to hang out, have lunch or just work on your computer.  Atmosphere 5/5: I just love how cozyness of this place. I visited a lot of different coffee place in the Valley and they all look the same. Most of the coffee places are boring and without any originality. Sunrise is one of those Coffee place that reminds me Portland and I just feel like I am not in Las Vegas when I am there. The place is quiet, the music level is perfect and the lighting is great. Food 3/5: Food is good and it's definitely a great place to have a quick lunch. I tried the Alien's Burrito which looks like a Super-Size Burrito. It was good and that was a great idea to add Couscous in the Burrito! Nice one! Service 4/5: Service is good and fast. They make sure to help you out if you don't know what to order. And they are nice and geniune person working there!  Definitely a good place to hang out if you want to escape from the craziness of Vegas.",

Their coffee is organic, and there are tons of yummy, vegan and vegetarian options. Best latte I've had since moving to Las Vegas!  I had the Alien burrito, which was super original and delicious.

I ordered the Hazelnut Latte and the Alien Burrito.  The Hazelnut Latte was fantastic, and one of the better lattes i've drank. The coffee and the hazelnut don't overpower each other. You don't taste the bitterness of the coffee and you don't taste too much of the hazelnut, just a hint of it.   The Alien Burrito is a vegetarian option. It has cous cous, refried beans, hummus, tomato, red bell pepper, and lettuce in a spinach tortilla wrap. I used to think that being a vegetarian would be the worst thing ever because i'm always thinking, \"what the hell do I eat?\". But if there more vegetarian options like this, it wouldn't be too bad. Good brunch burrito. I felt clean after eating it.",

It feels like I'm hanging out with friends who just happen to make coffee and suck money out of my credit card while doing so - Every drink I have tasted is either good or really good, which is rare since I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee - Seating and outlets! - Outdoor seating for nicer weather; also dog-friendly - Organized and visually appealing menu - Prices affordable especially for the quality you get - Drive-thru available for those in a rush but I'm sure that can't be fun for employees  DISLIKES - The horrible traffic due to construction - It can get crowded aka lack of seating aka don't come in a huge group (a testament to their popularity) - Closes early (not a surprise for a coffee shop of course, but it's nice to study at midnight sometimes)  My personal favorite: Truffle berry latte less sweet! Harmonious blend of raspberry and chocolate.  Who needs proper sentences anyway?

Their business hours have changed so now they're open from 6 am till 11 pm. They used to stay open till 9, but with the intense popularity that this local coffee shop has gained, it only makes sense! They cater to a variety of people, whether you are vegan or vegetarian since they have a vegan food menu and alternative milks for drinks.

I find it difficult to find a good independently owned coffee shops that has a pretty cool and relaxed ambiance and that serves good freshly roasted coffee. This place has all of that. Even mason jars for your drinks if you're eating in!! The store itself has a modern and hipster feel with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.    There's a big variety of drinks on their menu, including some of their specialty drinks. Keep in mind they also have a small sign near the register that shows their other \"seasonal\" drinks. The reason that word is in quotations is because their \"seasonal\" drinks are available all year round!! Having a craving for a peppermint mocha in the middle of July?? Yeah, they have it here!!   The coffee itself is amazing and since they have a roaster in the back, you know that it hasn't been sitting in some bag for months. I've tried some of their specialty drinks and they're not bad. I love how it's not too sweet and even when some of the flavors sound like they won't mix, the mix of coffee and flavors come out just right. My personal favorite is the Creme Brulee. It's my boyfriend's favorite too and he hasn't ordered anything else since.   I haven't had a chance to try out their food but I'm reading good things about the Alien Burrito. Can't wait to come back and try it!!",

The lights outside weren't on yet because it wasn't dark when I left but my friend and I made a mental note to come back after dark next time.   I saw some people studying, some writing papers and others just hanging out enjoying some coffee.   Their menu offers a wide variety of items but what stood out to me was the truffleberry, Nutella and creme brulee. I asked the guy at the register what was in the truffleberry and he said chocolate and berries (might have been raspberries). My friend and I decided to go with hot Nutella latte and a creme brulee latte. A medium and a large came out to be around $9, which isn't bad considering Starbucks prices have gone up within the past year.  We got our drinks within 5 minutes, maybe less. I like my drinks on the stronger side and forgot to tell them less sugar... It was very sweet. Still drinkable but sweet. I also didn't get a hazelnutty taste. I had my friend try it and she couldn't put her finger on the taste either. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away. My friend enjoyed her creme brulee, saying it had a burnt sugar aftertaste. I tried it and it was ok. I think next time if I order a latte I'll ask for less sugar or stick to their classics or pour over coffee.   I really like the chill atmosphere, not sure how it'll be during busy hours and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get any studying done here but it's a nice place to catch up with friends. Can't wait to come back to try something else!",

I heard they have an extensive food menu, but none of it is listed on their menu outside so, with cars behind me, I quickly ordered a bagel, toasted with cream cheese and a London Fog. What I received was a fairly burned bagel with so much cream cheese on it, it was as if they put the entire tub on there. I was also very disappointed to find that my London Fog was nothing but a plain, black tea.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Strawberry Corriander Muffin Banana Walnut Muffin Pineapple Cinnamon Roll Drip Coffee  Visited occasionally in the past for coffee en route to the office, but overlooked for pastries as items were previously outsourced, a return visit to Sunrise Coffee was planned the moment rumor was heard that all muffins, cookies, and confections were now crafted by the team at sister-shop Mothership; plans to meet owner Juanny Romero at 9:00am just a mile down the street prompting an early stop that showed the brew as bold as ever while the relaxed vibe and free WiFi offered impetus to stick around and enjoy a trio of pastries crafted with top tier ingredients and balance bolstered by creativity as well as skill.  A icon of the local coffee culture since 2008, and as such a veritable forefather to the current scene slowly creeping towards the Strip and Western Suburbs, Sunrise Coffee has long featured the locally roasted Mothership brand of beans and with fanciful lattes, espressos, cappuccinos, pour-overs, and presses available it was instead in a medium cup of drip that I invested, the effect of light roasting readily apparent even in the simplest option as fig and caramel tones coated the tongue,  Moving on to pastries, each item individually plated by one of four friendly youngsters tasked with everything from barrista duties to crafting sandwiches from organic produce sourced from a farm in California, the glass case at Sunrise is a bit more straightforward than the counter of Mothership, but with some similarities and a focus on balanced flavors the only question becomes where best to invest one's appetite, the seasonal cinnamon roll a good first choice as caramelized pineapple finds balance in light yeast with the sort of frosting that never seems cloying, but rather a semi-sweet delivery mechanism for the cinnamon and butter tones beneath.  Passing on a scone that had previously wowed on Green Valley Parkway, instead choosing to focus on muffins exclusive to Sunrise, it was with bites of the strawberry and  corriander iteration that the tasting progressed, and with a supple crumb and flavors that bridged savory to natural sweetness the follow-up was no less remarkable, the bitterness of dark walnuts proving an admirable foil to overripe bananas as  homey autumnal notes rang through with aplomb.  Now perhaps best judged as the casual sibling of brainy sister Mothership, Sunrise Coffee Roasters continues to turn out some of the city's best brews, and for those looking to sit, sip, savor, and perhaps enjoy a sandwich there are few better places to do so in town.",

Toasted bread with gooey peanut butter with sliced bananas, granola, almonds and dried cranberries were delicious!

    "text": "A cute coffee shop that's EXTREMELY vegan friendly?!? Yesssss!  It's my first time here, but certainly not my last. The cafe itself is very cute. You can choose to sit on couches, at a table, or on the high chairs. It's very crowded today so it is a bit loud, but put on some headphones and the atmosphere becomes very conducive to getting work done on a laptop.   Today, I tried the chai latte with almond milk & the vegan nom nom burrito. My latte came out at the perfect temperature...hot without burning my tongue when I took a sip immediately after it came out. It also wasn't too spicy as some chai lattes can be (Starbucks chai is the worst!) Although I'm not a huge fan of soy replacing non-vegan items in vegan food, I did enjoy my burrito. It stayed True to it's name as I \"nom nom'd\" every last bite of this tasty wrap. The veggies inside were fresh & crisp, and the combination of the flavors would satisfy even a non-vegan (which I am).   Everything came out in a timely manner, and the customer service is great! They also have free Wifi, which is a must for every real coffee spot. I found my new breakfast place of choice! I look forward to trying ALL of the menu items, and I will update accordingly.   * 2nd visit: I tried the Vegan Alien Burrito...I think I like this one even better than the Nom Nom Burrito. The cous cous with beans is something I would have never imagined to put together but it works so well!! I also just realized that they have a drive thru...super convenient for when you're in a rush but still want their yummy grub.",

    "text": "Stopped in real quick to pick up a few coffees on my way to pick my husband up from work and my first impressions were pretty good for this place.   It was mid-morning, so there were quite a few people here both indoors and out on their little-covered patio area. There were a few people ahead of me, but the girl at the register seemed quick and knew the menu well so I didn't have to wait long.   I was in a rush, so I just ordered what I normally order, a Mocha and an Iced coffee for the hubby. Prices do seem higher here than other locations I've been to in the area, so keep that in mind if you're trying to get something cheap. However, their coffees are delicious! My Mocha was smooth and rich tasting. I'd come back just for that.   The coffee shop was clean and seemed organized, however, there are too many tables and chairs in the inside for the space. People can practically touch elbows with the people at the other table if they aren't careful.   Other than coffee, they also serve breakfast and lunch items. I can't wait to come back and try out some of their baked goods and wraps. Everything looked delicious.",

Best of all is the location, which is near me!   I like the vegan Nom Nom burrito or the three bean chili burrito.   Buy a bag of beans and support your local coffee beanery!   At peak hours it can be tough to get a seat, but most of the time there's a table or two still available, or you can sit at the raised bar or on the patio. The patio has gotten progressively nicer over the years.   Yay for local, veg friendly, independent coffee shops. Free wifi works well.",

Their coffee is the best.  The butterbeer and truffleberry lattes are my favorite.  I get iced lattes and they serve them in mason jars which is adorable.  Not overly pricey either.  They play great music!  They have a drive through which is also convenient.    They have a jug of water set out and glasses next to it, somewhat of a rare find in coffee shops.  I bought coffee beans from them and that coffee was really good as well.  One last thing, they have my favorite workers of all the coffee shops in Vegas!  Their employees are exactly what you'd want and expect from a cute little coffee shop.  Super friendly and always happy.  Being a college student that loves coffee I tend to frequent coffee shops, and this is by far my favorite one.  It's pretty far from where I live but I'm willing to make the drive.",

I went through the drive-thru, which was easy and quick. The prices were more than I thought, but reasonable if you're buying something that has the words \"Nutella\" and \"Mocha\" in it. I also added a croissant to that order.  The truck in front of me had a dog which looked like it was getting bajiggity with excitement and when they pulled up to the window, the girl at the window gave this pretty lab-looking dog a treat! You gotta love dog-friendly places.  From my car, the outside area looked full for a weekday late morning, which you always like to see. I will have to update if I get a chance to go in and spend some time one day.  Either way - the coffee is tasty, the drive-thru is quick, the menu is a reasonable size and the people are friendly!",

Also not hipster.... Just their own. The guy at the front counter had a smile on his face and ALSO a style all his own. I hate coffee houses that make employees where uniform. So I was glad to see him as an individual, with an apron. :) I ordered the s'mores latte iced. I liked it....  I did. I really did, but I'm a coffee geek AND HATE not tasting THE BEAN in my drink.  I guess every True test is to order an iced black coffee or hot black .... Seeing as how I did neither I will table this review as I intend to revisit! Any recommendations are welcome!!!",

I'm from out of town and when I work in vegas I have to have my morning coffee, and this place really is a treat.  They have two La Marzocco espresso machines, which really make a difference on how your coffee comes out and the foam. Hey, some people care about this stuff...  I had the breakfast burrito and it was good! Maybe a little heavy on the potato, but it was pretty tasty.  Why not 5 stars? If 5 stars was PERFECT, then 4 is really good. If I'm being really picky, the coffee flavor could be a little stronger, maybe a darker roast? Also, the food wasn't out of this world (as far as what I've tried) but overall, for the price, it's a great local coffee shop. I will be going back there whenever I come back to Vegas.",

The legendary hot chocolate (off-menu item) is, well, legendary.  It's basically a caramel hot chocolate, but it's pretty damn good.    The herbal teas here are excellent.  Great selection and their brewing techniques are meticulous.  They do sell the loose leaf tea for take home as well.   Unfortunately, I haven't been able to replicate the results at home but I'm also too cheap to get good water.  I tried a latte once as well, and it was pretty good.  Very smooth and not bitter.  I did want to try the food before writing a review.  I got to try the elf bread with whipped honey at a Yelp event and that was very good.  It's supposed to give you all the nutritional requirements of a full meal.  Recently, I got a breakfast burrito to start my day.  Unfortunately, I got overwhelmed at work, couldn't eat it until 1 hour later, and can't really chew anyway right now (long story).  But the egg, beans, potato, and salsa I picked out with my fork was still pretty good, even cold.  There's a lot of fresh, but dry, spinach in the breakfast burrito, so you may want to pick something else if you don't like spinach.  Although this coffee shop is not close or convenient for me, I enjoy stopping by whenever I have the time and like the consistency of their products.",

It's my only \"go to\" coffee shop from here on out, I don't care that it's across town, it's more than worth it. It's so perfect, reminds me of the great coffee houses of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, but on a smaller scale.

They know their regulars, and welcome new people as if they are old friends. This kind of service is why you look for local coffee shops in the first place.   I always go for a simple drink when going to a new spot, almond milk latte, and they rocked it! I'll be back for sure, thank you so much!!!",

It looks like sunrise coffee used to be a starbucks store.  They had a large variety of lattes and coffee on the menu.  I had went for the nutella latte is was pretty good..  It is close to the air port in an industrial area, so I may not get there again.. but I did enjoy it.",

    "text": "I have been going to sunrise coffee for about 2 or 3 years now. The longer I come here and the more things I try, the more I like this establishment.  They roast their coffee and espresso in house; sometimes when you go in you can smell the coffee being roasted and it adds even more to the experience. I know they're using freshly roasted espresso which comes through in their drink quality. I typically get a macchiato or black coffee because their beans are the strength of their drinks and I can't get it any where else keep this .            In Vegas there is a debate, samba latte or sunrise?  The espresso and drip coffee quality at sunrise is no doubt superior. Not to mention the baristas at sunrise are far more pleasant and unpretentious; unlike this review. So give sunrise a a visit, try it a couple times before you make a decision and find out what you like there.",

    "text": "I discovered this place years ago while working down the street from them - the staff in our office would ONLY buy coffee from Sunrise. All of their products are fair trade and they have tons of vegan, gluten free, and protein-packed options, as well as regular treats. The quality/taste of pretty much everything from this place is exceptional, and they have a lot of unique offerings. Their staff is always on-point. The vibe is great and they are therefore, always extremely busy - Michelle Obama even visited once. Price wise, they're kind of average, considering the offerings. I do wish their large was a little bigger. I now live and work fairly far from this place, but whenever I am even remotely close to this part of town, I stop in. It's my favorite in all of Vegas.   P.S. They also do coffee art! :)",

After about 5 visits, I am hooked and would be happy coming here daily.  The first thing I noticed unique about this place, the flavors of lattes they offer. Mexican mocha, creme brulee, truffle berry, and nutella. Of course they have classic coffees and americanos too, but I was sold on all these options.  The service is fast and on point. If I come inside they always ask me, \"for here or to go\" even if I only order a drink.  The one time I did stay in, I ordered a cinnamon roll that they offered to heat up for me and it literally was the best one I have ever had.  There is a drive-thru for those who stay in their pjs. Just an all around good coffee joint, with even better people serving you.",

Not in the way of how it looks or the popularity or the customer service... But in the way of the taste and the quality of the coffee. Ever since they switched their coffee provider from Klatch Coffee to Mothership Coffee Roasters, the taste of the coffee has suffered drastically.  Sorry Sunrise, you just aren't the same as you used to be. My friend also got an Ethiopian French Press that tasted like dirt.  The only redeeming quality of this place is the food, the alien burrito is still delicious.  Please return to using good roasters for your coffee provider.",

My boyfriend and I come to Vegas often to just get away from real life and every time we are in Vegas we always tend to try out new things for our taste buds (we are foody people) anyway, we came across Sunrise on Yelp because I wanted A coffee since I am a addict and wanted a cappuccino lol well when when first stepped in, it's pretty small in the inside, there was a lot of people (I'm thinking students since they all had computers and notebooks out) and so we know that this was a popular place for them but there was more seating outside so it was no biggie. Well I ordered my cappuccino and my boyfriend ordered a chai latte with a cookie (did I mention they have vegan items? The cookie and Capp were vegan so yay! Pointers for sunrise!) and the staff were suuuuuuuper friendly. We tried our coffees out and man oh man were they bomb diggity! Including the cookie! We were very pleased at this coffee shop and ever since having their Capps, we have been going there everyday because they are THAT GOOD! No joke! So if you are around town wanting some good coffee, desserts and food I'd definitely recommend this place 100%!   Oh and another thing....they are green friendly! So I am one happy Vegan! Yay!  :D",

It gave the coffee shop more of an earthy vibe. Then I walked in, and saw all of the UNLV students sitting at coffee tables taking care of projects/ homework. It is definitely a place for students to study, since a cup of espresso goes with any book!   I ordered the creme brulee medium coffee, which to my surprise, they upgraded it to large for free since they didn't have any medium cups at the time. My husband ordered a French vanilla coffee. We both enjoyed the coffee due to the fact it wasn't Starbucks. Then we sat and had the NOM NOM burritto, and for it being a vegan burrito wasn't bad at all! Overall, the coffee shop was nice, quaint, quiet enough for an intimate conversation and just a slow change of pace from the Las Vegas traffic and chaos. Hope this helps.",

However, the last few visits have been \"ok\" at best.. my latte this morning was as weak as could be.  If I hadn't already driven all the way to my office, I would have come back for a remake/refund.  The drive-thru seems to be forgotten about lately, also.  I waited 10mins at the window before having to remind the guy that eventually came what my order was.  It was comped, which was appreciated, but still.  The SAME thing happened to my husband not even a week later. Only nobody ever came to the window and he left.  Still, normally, I love the coffee and the people... Just please, step it back up!",

I randomly came here since I had to wait a couple hours before the class started and I was quite surprised at how wonderful of a place it is.   The baristas are so friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks. They play great music, display nice artwork, and have a bookshelf full of books (some appear not to be the greatest selection, but that's okay) and the clientele that come in regularly are all artsy and studious type of individuals so it's a nice crowd to be around.   The drinks I've had were fantastic. I've had their caramel frappe, white mocha frappe, and butterscotch beer frappe. When you sit in they serve their drinks in the cutest little mason jars! That made me really happy for some reason. It was just a unique touch.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the size of the shop and due the to popularity of it, it can be hard to find seats and you may feel a little squished when you're sitting there on a busy day. The outdoor patio seating area is really cute, but still not enough space especially if the weather doesn't permit outdoor seating. Other than that, I love this little gem of a coffee shop. Great place!",

Oh, and everything is practically organic so two thumbs up in my book!  I took home some Hakunamatata loose tea (2 oz. = $4) and it's quite delish!

It's difficult to pick out favorites from Sunrise, because everything I've ever tried has been delicious. I'm not a huge coffee drinker (usually their peach iced tea, sweetened with agave is my order), but I adore their coffee. The beans are roasted in the shop and are top quality. Their lattes are to die for, especially the caramel vanilla and Nutella. Their pastries are phenomenal, including the vegan and gluten-free options. But their food, oh my stars... I crave their multigrain egg sandwich and nom-nom burrito all the time. So delicious, great quality ingredients, and healthy!  The service is always great, too. They employ some of the nicest people around :) And it's such a cute little shop! Love the outdoor seating.",

    "text": "I've been going to this place for a few years now.  I will say that it is the best cafe place in Vegas if you also want to grab some food with your drinks.  Not a huge coffee drinker, but their Mexican Mocha is probably the best drink on the menu...however I am a bit of a London Fog lush.  The Nom Nom Burrito and the Alien Burrito are the highlights of the food menu.  As noted in other reviews this place sells only vegan/vegetarian food items from what I've seen.  However, if you're an omnivore like me, you can definitely get stuffed and get your grub on pretty easy here.  The place is constantly updating it's furniture, art work, music list (which is actually quite eclectic for a place that has a total hipster vibe to it).  Their sweets also seem to be changing constantly.  Which can be a bummer.  I used to love snacking on their banana walnut muffins...which they used to make all the time.  Now I haven't seen those in like a year and I hardly get any of their sweets anymore.  The staff for the most part are fairly approachable and friendly.  Some actually make an attempt to remember my name (which goes a long way for me!) and will start up a conversation with me.  You can tell a lot of them at least give off the vibe they really like working there...quite a few have been there for years.  Negatives:  The consistency on the food can be off.  It's amazing how I can get a pretty tasty Nom Nom Burrito one day and a very bland one another day.  Same thing with the drinks, though drink issues I would say are at a much lower occurrence.  It shouldn't be a horrible reflection on this place.  They represent Vegas well for a city that is not known for it's coffee/cafe scene.  But consistency issues have stopped me from being a weekly customer.",

When it gets warmer, Sunrise has an adorable patio for those who don't mind basking in the sounds of the city.   It is the perfect little meeting spot for old friends who both have stories to catch up on!  Sunrise coffee also has a bunch of vegan/vegetarian and gluten free options, which I love (my family has gone gluten free). Be warned, it can get really busy, so definitely be prepared to wait if you plan to order hot food. I have ordered the matcha latte, hot mess bowl, and the alien burrito--all three are tastiness and perfection from this cafe.  I love Sunrise.

We actually went to two other places before but both weren't exactly our \"cup of coffee\" haha, so we were relieved we found this place.  Its a 3rd Wave coffee house and they serve pour overs and the usual coffee drinks. We were deciding between the Guatemalan and the Ethiopian roasts that was being presented. The Guatemalan bean was $3.95 and the Ethiopian was $4.95. My buddy got the Guatemalan and I selected the Ethiopian. I shared we were from out of town and first time visitors so I was able to convince the friendly barista to just charge me $3.95 and he agreed. Good guy!  Well, it was the right choice because the notes of the coffee was really enjoyable and light, very nutty and fruity. I would definitely order this again if I were ever to return which I probably would go out of my way to come here for good coffee whenever I'm in town again.  Nice environment, friendly staff and patrons. Started conversations with some peeps who were locals who were giving us the low down on a few places in town we might enjoy.

The coffee shop is absolutely adorable - great indoor seating with lots of outlets (and AC) to enjoy a hot cup of coffee OR a cute patio outdoor area if you want to sit out in the extreme desert heat with some shade to enjoy a cold iced coffee... lots of choices here and a great place to get work done or catch up with friends! Highly recommended",

The place is absolutely bonkers on weekends at least with students, people working on laptops, and friends getting together. I love the patio space and it's nice when the weather permits to get away from the craziness inside. The last time I was in I ordered a chai tea latte but it was spiced in a way I've never tasted before. Maybe that means it's actually fresh? It was unexpected but definitely powerful. They have a drive through for anyone in a hurry. It's definitely a bit of a yuppie crowd but how many gourmet coffee shops aren't. It's a cute spot, recommend for first dates or as a place to study if you can grab a spot. Otherwise take your coffee to go on a stroll through Sunset Park",

Baristas guess at what the temperature of the water is. Too hot makes bitter coffee - too cold doesn't make a rich cup. Drip brew just tasted bad, as if there is detergent residue that isn't properly rinsed from the holding tanks.   On the other hand, beans that I brew myself in the French press: A+.  Also noteworthy: the Do-gooder bagel is so delicious. Whoever was in the kitchen yesterday around noon was on point. Perfect toast makes life sweet!  5 stars for beans and bagels.  -2 for bummer drinks in the store.",

I love the fact that they have vegan options, I would love it even more if they had more vegan options! But, they do have a few items and they are really good.  I love the vegan cream cheese with avocado added to a bagel. That with a decaf with soy is a great breakfast, which I enjoyed eating sitting in the outside seating area on a nice day earlier this week.  On other trips to sunrise I have usually ordered the Tofurkey sandwich which is also really delicious.  There's also a yummy veggie wrap on the menu that I've had a few times.  The drink choices are good, and I really like their decaf coffee here.  It's a small, unassuming place with a crunchy granola vibe to it.  Wish it was closer to home and I'd go way more often!",

The girl who helped me was friendly and knowledgeable when it came to the drinks I had questions about. I have tried both hot and iced coffees and they were tasty. One drink I recommend is the Orange Mocha it was very good and a drink I'd totally get again. When it came to the White Chocolate Mocha I thought it was good, but not great. I don't live near this location, far from it actually, but when in the area I'll be utilizing the drive-thru for more of that tasty orange mocha and they have other flavors I'd like to try. I had a croissant and it was big, flaky and tasty.   They offer vegetarian, vegan and gluten free food. Some of the menu items are things like pastries, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, wraps, burritos and granola.",

What I was expecting was a vanilla flavored latte with a bruleed froth top.  What I received was a latte with raw sugar generously sprinkled over the froth.  This was fine for me since I like my lattes this way.  Crunching raw sugar in between sips of coffee is a satisfying feeling. Still, I can't help but wonder how amazing the drink would have been with blowtorched sugar crystals. The boyfriend ordered a cold brew.  It was strong, smooth and refreshing on that hot September day.  In addition to our drinks, I picked out a lemon strawberry muffin.  The flavor combination sounded intriguing.  The muffin wasn't as moist as expected, but still a pleasing texture.  (I personally prefer a drier pastry with my coffee)  It was a good size, perfect for splitting, and wasn't overly sweet.  The muffin itself was lemon flavored and had strawberry jam swirled inside.    This charming, off-strip cafe would be my regular coffee spot if I lived in Vegas.",

The second time it happened, I was the only person in the coffee shop and they just never made my drink.

    "text": "It's been over 5 years since my last review and fate would find me down in this neck of the woods today.  I was in need of rocket fuel to help propel me back up to NW side of town, so I stopped by.  When I used to work on this side of town, Sunrise was often visited.  The owners, staff, food, and coffee were TOP SHELF....PERIOD.  Who the hell would want to visit a corporate....and I hate saying it......\"coffee shop,\" when you are within a quick drive to this Las Vegas GEM?  I pulled into the drive-thru, and noticed the vehicle in front of me was waved to the window.  I skipped the inoperable squawk box and waited for lead to retrieve their order and punch out.  I reflected on previous experiences and smiled.  When I pulled up, I was met with smiles and ordered up a coup of iced, double dirty chai from a friendly gent.  When the window opened again...I was handed my beverage, by another smiling and friendly gent.  I immediately smelt the strong oder of espresso emanating from my drink.  My olfactory senses were confused.  This never happens at the \"other\" place.  I am a consumer slave and sap for convenance.  There is NO Sunrise Coffee on the other side of valley.  The multiple, multiple dirties I have consumed from \"you know who,\" don't illicit this type of physical response.  Sunrise.....How I have missed you!  With purchase in hand, I pulled forward longing for that first sip.  When it happened...I marveled at the precision and craftsmanship of my muddy chai.  Not the \"Sloppy Joe\" of flavors from \"place with the mermaid as it's logo,\" but crisp, clean, and surgical.  The sort of CRISP, CLEAN, and SURGICAL flavor one would get off of sucking on the bosom of glacier... after tasting tap water your whole life.  The buzz from these two shots cannot be equaled by four \"big business\" shots.  Those shots are the same kind one would get after drinking 6 cups of Folgers.  It's a mechanical and industrial sort of feeling.  The Sunrise espresso high is different.  It's colorful.  It's warm and earthy.  I was in a happy and productive state for at least two hours.  Thank you Sunrise Coffee!  Five years and still solid.  A solid FIVE stars, and perhaps my most favorite coffee shop in Vegas or elsewhere.",

    "text": "They make great lattes. As far as lattes go, this is the 2nd best latte in Vegas. It's really personal preference for one place that has a creamier finer foam.   As far as overall taste, ambiance, selection, and customer service, this is the best coffee house in Vegas. I love supporting local coffee places and am so glad this one is only a hop away.   It has a typical hipster vibe but isn't pretentious. It's very clean. There's comfy chairs and tables with plenty of outlets. I wish the space was bigger with more seating because it can fill fast. There's a nice pet friendly patio.  Service is usually fast and friendly. I usually get a warm and what seems like genuine greeting. They use compostable eco friendly cups. I don't mind paying a bit more for my coffee knowing the business practices utilized.   They have a good assortment of coffee and tea. My nephews love vanilla milk/vanilla steamers. The latte art is beautiful, and part of the reason it's best to sit inside and slowly sip and savor the latte. I'm a fan of the brimstone and they have seasonal lattes year round. I tried the pistachio white mocha, pistachio flavor was weak. I prefer a bit more than a hint of flavor, but that's personal preference and I'll just ask for more next time. They, or rather sister company,mothership coffee, provides the beans. Don't forget to get a stamp card.  They have a convenient drive through. Still got great service. The gentleman offered water as we waited for our drinks to be made.  They have delicious food offerings that can be vegan friendly.  Definitely worth a stop.",

My favorite part is they have the real crunchy ice like Sonic.    For the price I think I'd rather have Starbucks but you can't beat the ambiance of this place.  I feel like everyone in here is either studying for their surgical finals or writing the script for the next blockbuster movie.  Michelle Obama gets her coffee here (la-ti-daaaa).    If you are afraid of birds I suggest you stay inside because the patio is filled with them, and they ain't shy!  I saw a few fly right onto tables that people were sitting at.",

I was planning on trying a few places, but once I went here I literally couldn't go anywhere else!   The first day I asked the barista to just make me a surprise drink. And DAMN she came through!! She gave me the almond amoretto mocha. It was incredible. She also told me about the vegan chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. I was in coffeeland heaven.   Day two I decided to try something different. I went with the nutella blended drink. Gahhhh sooooo goooooood. I also got a croissant to eat and that was awesome too. Just all so so so so delicious.   The last day (today) I asked the barista again what she recommends. She told me to go with the S'more latte that has toasted marshmallow, dark chocolate, and brown sugar. WOW what a party in my mouth! And I got the cookie butter muffin.   Go here. Live here. If I lived here I would be rocking this place allll the time. Plus the outside is SUPER instagramable. Which is always a plus. Plus the drinks are delicious AND beautiful! Have your beauty and brains here my friends. And they have drive thru! What an incredible place. I will be back again when I come back to Vegas. This is a magical coffee shop filled with great people and great things.",

    "text": "After reading so many positive Yelp reviews about Sunrise Coffee I decided to give it a try as a mid afternoon caffeine pick-me-up was calling. I was surprised how crowded it was for a Wednesday at 3pm. As I made my way up to the counter I was promptly greeted by a smiling coffee barista. Since I'm limited on my daily carbs I figured it was safe to stick to basic hot coffee.    The sign said ask about the flavor of the day. It was Papua New Guinea and it was awesome. Not too bold but just the right smoothness with no bitter finish. Since there wasn't anywhere to sit I decided to get my coffee to go. Definitely a younger, more hipster crowd. I think I may have been the oldest person in there at 37 years old. The food and goodies looked yummy (yeah I'm looking at you Alien burrito!) but will save that for another day. I must remember to wear my beanie next time too!",

    "text": "Sunrise has been my go-to coffee spot for about 3 years now, a 5 minute walk from my work. I was enamored with the place when I first discovered it, but it's been going downhill for the last year or so, in my opinion. I loved coming in here, the service was great and the food was just as good. I would always order the veganized alien burrito and it was always perfect. It didn't matter what time of day or what day of the week, the food, coffee, and service always left me feeling good.   I don't know what changed, but I really don't vibe with this place anymore. I went in this morning, and no one was smiling. The girl who passed my drink order off to me just called my name and handed me the drink without any thank you, eye-contact, or acknowledgment of any kind. I ordered an iced Americano with an extra shot and extra extra ice, since I'm walking and it's hot af in Vegas, but the drink I had just had a few ice cubes floating at the top. I tried to grab the barista's attention, but she was behind the espresso machines talking to the cashier, do I need to wave my arms and shout to get the staff's attention after they've already been rude? I just left, drinking my water-coffee, shaking my head.  How's the food? I've stopped ordering off the menu, since they can't seem to get the Alien burrito figured out. Every time I've ordered it recently, it's been different. Cheese? That's a fun one to find when you pay extra to veganize your order and take it to go! Will it have a just a few thin slivers of bell pepper, or will it have 30? Is that... ranch dressing? I guess I'm not vegan today.. Oh good, at least they remembered avocado this time!  Maybe my standards have gone up, maybe theirs have gone down, I don't know, but all in all, for me, it's a so-so spot that used to be great.",

Their caramel vanilla iced latte is on point without being overwhelmingly sweet and their americanos are seriously to die for.     A new favorite of mine to switch up the pace and in an attempt to lessen my daily coffee intake: I've taken to asking for their mint matcha green tea, iced and with enough milk to essentially make it a latte. The result? A light, creamy peppermint patty like concoction with just a hint of green tea. Nom! :3   As for the atmosphere and the aesthetics of the place? I can not rave of this place enough.  Like a good cup of coffee (lol), the shop is saturated in consistent, cohesive and understated little details that don't necessarily slap you in your face upon first glance but are appreciated nonetheless when brought to light.  Extension cords, outlets are a plenty and are strategically hidden under a couple of their banquet style study/dining tables, their community board is usually packed with interesting local clientele ads, events  and offerings, fresh flowers are hidden in a corner or two, there's a gorgeous whimsical Amy Sol (for Audrey Kawasaki lovers, she's definitely an artist to check out) painting,  and my favorite?: tip jars whose signs change every other week that's bound to plant an amused smirk or smile on your face. The varied music selection that's played is also a plus. Overall if you haven't already, make the trek down here. It's well worth the try.",

There's a big variety of coffee drinks to choose from, your favorite cafe latte or chai (brewed here, no powder). They offer all the regular milks, and also almond and rice milk. They suggested a new tea for me, Cherry Jubilee, which wasn't on the menu. Very fruitful, but tasty. I love that they provide Truvia sweetener. Big bonus point.  I also got a cinnamon raisin bagel, and their spreads... You can choose regular butter or cream cheese, however, they also offer vegan cream cheese, almond butter, organic strawberry jelly and peanut butter. I am one who very much enjoys these options!

A variety of milk alternatives (rice, almond, etc.) are available, contrasted with many places which offer only soy milk.  The house coffee blend (what you get when you order, say, an ice coffee) is one of the best coffees I've ever had.  Given that this is just their house blend, their specialty coffees are something really special indeed.  For food I ate their tofurkey 'wich, which was pretty good.  Definitely a tasty lunch snack.  Their 'NomNom' burrito was the best breakfast burrito my girlfriend had ever eaten.  For avocado lovers out there, when they say there is avo on something, they do Not skimp.  On top of their great food and drink, the help is knowledgeable and friendly.  We sat and had fun conversations and felt really welcomed by Mike.  The decor of the shop is modern but not cold, and the atmosphere is very calm, low key.  Whether you're in a rush and need to just pick up a great tasting coffee, or want to lounge for a while and sip, Sunrise Coffee is an excellent choice even if you have to head a bit out of the way.",

I recommend them and Grouchy Johns to all of my friends and clients. Starbucks doesn't stand a chance! You also HAVE to try their Alien Burrito! It's amazing. Thumbs up!",

    "text": "Sunrise Coffee is perfect for those wanting an alternative to the chain coffee shops who sell overpriced, sometimes questionable in quality drinks. At Sunrise Coffee, they make delicious, organic drinks that are very reasonable in price. What I especially like about this coffee shop is the care and love they take in making each drink. The little details, like the latte art on each cappuccino, are much appreciated. They also have special deals, usually in the form of free drinks, found on their Yelp page.   After looking over the drink menu board, I settled on a large Iced Peach Tea. The worker suggested adding a pump of peach syrup to give my tea a stronger peach flavor and a little sweetness, to which I obliged. Thank goodness I took her advice because my tea was delicious. Refreshing, slightly sweet and peachy without being too peachy. It was perfect.   This coffee shop gets another star for free wifi, friendly service and knowledgeable staff. They also have puzzles and books available for customers to pass the time with while sipping on their drinks.    I definitely want to go back and try their other drinks and maybe even some of their vegan fare. In conclusion, instead of another green mermaid, we need more cafes like Sunrise Coffee around Vegas.",

Even an antique-looking gong by the door if you need some om in your day.  Best thing about this place.  It isn't trying too hard.  Its Vegas.

Once we were done with our drinks (about 20 mins after we got them) we went inside to see what was up with the food order. I noticed what I thought was our order sitting on the counter & asked if it was ours.. \"Oh yeah, we've been calling for it for a while\" was their response. I inquired as to why it didn't get brought outside like the drinks were & they said something about the tag or receipt not saying \"outside\". Really? Our order was all on the same tab & somehow the drinks made it outside to us but not the food? I don't know how long it had been sitting there while other people came up to get their orders & possibly coughed &/or sneezed on our food. Ick.  I might return again but maybe just for the coffee & that's a BIG might.",

I must have passed this dozens of times over the years but never knew it was there.  It doesn't really look like much from the outside, but the inside is a different story: modern with wood accents and a patio that I didn't notice when I drove up.  And, it has a drive-thru window.  Suzy and I both ordered the matcha green tea, but she got hers hot and I got mine iced.  We sat out on the patio, which is nice, but the place is right in the flight path of the airport, so there are planes flying over head every few minutes, which makes it hard to hear when you're deep in conversation.  The tea was great and so was the service.  I'll be back to try the famous Alien Burrito when I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "Feeling a little under the weather, I decided to suck it up and meet one of my dearest friends at the coffee shop to have a latte and get some work done.  I've heard so many great things about this place and thought this was the perfect opportunity!    It's located on north side of Sunset Rd after Pecos, if you're driving west bound.  It's in a small building, detached to a strip mall, like everything else in Las Vegas.  When you walk in, you're greeted by the beautiful aroma of espresso and a very warm staff.  They are fun, vibrant and ready to help.  Also, the place wasn't busy when I arrive, but man!  It's filled up quickly!  People sitting around the tables and couches, great conversations, working on their laptops.  Such an amazing coffee shop feel!    For my drink, I got the large hazelnut latte, hot and in a mug for $4.05.  When they called my name, I picked up my drink, only to find out that they beautifully decorated the froth into a leaf.  WOW!! I've heard of some coffee shops doing that but to see it in person was an amazing thing!  What was better than that, the latte was actually THE BEST latte I've ever tasted!  So creamy, lightly hinted with the taste of hazelnut and warm, but not too hot.  This drink was AH-MAZE-ING and completely on point.    I also got the peanut butter, jelly and banana sandwich for $3.45.  Omg, it reminded me of my younger days as a small kid.  The peanut butter wasn't chunky, however, so creamy and flavorful.  Btw, it's organic!  Huge plus.  Then add the strawberry jam and sliced bananas in a couple of multigrain toasted bread and you got heaven in a sammy.  Highly recommended for those who want to get in touch with their inner child.   Listen folks, I will definitely rave about this place for time to come.  In fact, I will get my happy butt here on the weekends to do some work from now on.  With the free wifi, why wouldn't you?  This place has got to be my top favorite coffee joints in Las Vegas.  Btw, from 5pm-8pm everyday, they have happy hour.  $1 hot or iced small coffee, $2 hot or iced small plain lattes and $1 pastries.  Hello reason to come back!  Thanks guys, for making this experience amazing!",

The building is a pretty good size, there is one long tall table, a pretty large low table with comfortable couch chairs and the rest of the area is tiny small tables. What I do not like too much about this coffee place are the tiny tables, especially if you come there to study. I can only fit my small laptop on the table and that's about. There is also an outside shaded portion, but is pretty hot in the summertime. It is an overall great place to come for coffee!",

    "text": "Oh Sunrise, you are definitely the only place with a legit latte in LV in a legit atmosphere. If you could get your service act together like it seems you should, it would be an easy five stars every time.  I first visited here on a Vegas trip 2 years ago and couldn't imagine going anywhere else for much needed caffeine. Came back this weekend on three separate occasions (twice in one day in fact). Yep, it's good like that.   Each time however, we had some sort of issue.   Visit 1: Four drinks - 2 soy lattes, 2 vanilla soy lattes. For some reason, one of the soy lattes didn't show up. Informed staff, obtained drink. More or less easy enough.   Visit 2: 1 soy latte, 2 soy vanilla lattes, 1 regular latte, 3 vegan burritos and some granola. One burrito shows up not vegan - informed and they made a new one but we were waiting while starving for quite some time. We are also given two soy lattes (that's what the girl told us they were - turns out they were the two vanilla soy lattes) which means that I ended up with the vanilla when I didn't want it but felt bad about having a drink thrown away so just drank it. Bro had to go obtain the other vanilla soy latte.   Visit 3: you guessed it, the soy latte went missing again! I watched the guy enter in the order details into the ipad, so I honestly don't know what happened. What I thought was the easiest drink (and of course mine, so I was a little more sad) just didn't show up.   Something in that process needs to be tweaked so all of the drinks are made. Other than that, everyone that works there has a stellar attitude. There's lots o milk choices (soy is gratis!!) and there's lots o vegetarian/vegan food options. I don't usually go out for coffee unless I'm away from home or it's an outing but if I lived anywhere in LV, I would definitely hit up Sunrise <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fevery.single.day&s=e5e78f800d6386cd9da8f8b1f5207e783931954e1b716eb320d05484d0bd4afe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">every.single.day</a> because their prices don't break the bank either.   So here's the breakdown: Local Roasters. Milk Options. Veg Food. Perfect Prices. Almost perfect service.   Definitely bookmark for your LV trip if you're a caffeine addict and require legit coffee.",

We were unaware that they closed so early. It would have been fine if they had announced a 10 minutes till closing or something of the like, but he locked the doors and announced we're locking up you have to go. I would understand locking the doors and not taking new orders but you simply do not throw out customers in the middle of their drink. That's just poor business practice. After the initial shock wore off I have concluded that it was one of the poorest customer service experiences I have encountered in quite some time. Good luck sunrise you won't sell me or my circle another cup of coffee.",

The freshly made muffins (banana nut is to die for) & cookies are great.  For me, being British but having lived in the PNW for many years, Sunrise reminds me of Portland, OR.. in a very very good way.  Really looking forward to the new shop on Sunset & GVP.",

    "text": "I have been on the hunt for a perfect coffee spot. I work from home, and love mixing it up scenery. Let's hit the basics:  1. The location is right off the main drag making it a pretty straight shot to get to.   2. Convenience Factor: There is a drive-thru which is perfect if you are on the go. If you are here to stay, there is ample parking!  3. Ambiance: There is the cutest outdoor seating area that makes you forget that you are essentially surrounded by a parking lot. This is a \"Don't Judge a Book by its Cover\" kind of shop. What I mean by that is from the outside, you are not sure it is going to be anything special, especially if you don't see the outdoor seating. When you walk in, you immediately feel at home. It is spacious and offers plenty of seating. The lighting is dim and relaxing and the music is not played so loud that you cannot hear yourself think. It is the perfect spot to work, study, or just meet a friend. Don't believe, go check it out and you can see people doing all of the above!  4. The good stuff: I was excited to hear that all of the coffee was organic! They only roast a medium blend which at first was off-putting but it was a delightful cup of coffee! The barista was extremely friendly and helpful. Since I was there to stay, my coffee was served in a nice ceramic mug. I did not try the food this trip, but their pastries look delicious and their vegan options are impressive!  My final thought is about the climate! If you spend several hours in a coffee shop like I do, temperature is important! Some cafe's seem to freeze people out or some get too hot - since you don't control the temperature, this is important! The temperature was great all day. Not too hot, not cold. It was honestly just right.   I will definitely be coming back!",

There just sandwiches but something about them makes them so tasty.  Must be the fresh ingredients and again maybe special mayo :)  Cool place, yummy food and great coffee!",

The staff was veeerrryyyyy friendly and I had regretted eating just before because I saw a wrap that looked amazing! I've found a few small coffee jems that I love but this is the first one that also serves food that looks amazing AND won't kill my diet like all the other pastries. Don't get me wrong they have pastries but it's nice to find a place that has it all; nice lunch, great atmosphere outdoors and indoors, amazing coffee (with the foam designs) and friendly staff.",

The shop is very chill with a nice cafe and urban interior. They have shelves filled with books to read if you'd like to sit and read a book or two. They offered nutella, creme brulee, and raspberry truffle lattes. I chose the creme brulee latte. Boy was it devine! It's very sweet, but it's such a delicious flavor. It tastes just like a creme brulee. The espresso in it really gives you a big wake up call, and is very rich.   I also loved that they have vegan food as well. I dried their croissant breakfast sandwich which was vegan. It was so good, and I'd definitely recommend you try it as well. Thankfully, it's made to order so you know it's fresh! They even had stamp cards for you if you choose to become a regular. Thanks to the Olympics they offered TWO stamps if you got their Olympic trivia right which I thought was fun.",

It is a breath of fresh air from the army of Starbucks that litter every block of a major metropolitan city.  Although the space is on the small size, the decor is warm and comes with really cool antique style leather seating. They have an impressive selection of mixed coffee drinks, and the Truffle Berry mocha that I got was quite tasty!    I also appreciate the fact that they offer breakfast menu items all day (burrito, egg sandwhich). I ordered an egg sandwich, which came with spinach, cheese, scrambled egg, tofurkey, avocado, and mayo on a whole wheat bread. The sandwich was pretty good. They also have some vegetarian fare on their menu.  I came in there around 10 AM and was a bit disappointed by their limited selection of sweet pastries. There was one cinnamon roll left and a couple of things that don't seem that memorable. I got a white chocolate and macadamia nut cookie, which was just so-so. It was a little on the dry side and wasn't very chewy.   I would definitely come back for their coffee and maybe try some of the sandwiches but I will pass on the pastries.",

Although there were times that it took more than 20 minutes to prepare my drink, many of the staff are nice (based on the Vegas standard).  However, once they got popularity as a kind of \"hip\" coffee place, their music became always loud, which not only bothered me to get my work done but also made me (and other customers) to raise voice to have a conversation. As a consequence, the noise level is pretty high. I don't want night-club atmosphere at a coffee shop, nor do I want to yell at my friends to have a conversation or use ear plugs.   I may still use the drive-thru, but I am staying away from this loud coffee shop.",

Pastrys: The peanut butter cookie is like no other. One day they offered to serve it warm. I thought...oh ok thats nice of them. But then it arrived with a small amount of peanut butter spread on top. WOW is all I can say. I didn't want to leave, and it took all of my will power not to order another, then another, then another :) . It doesnt stop there, I just tried the Sunrise Muffin. Its like a bran muffin with cranberries and raisins. Again unbelievable.   Beverages: Besides the fact that its all organic, its just plain delicious. I had the organic tea recently and I must admit it was quite refreshing. This is my new Sunrise Coffee summer drink. In the winter its as simple as cashiers chose. I walk in say \" what do you recommend today\" and they deliver absolute perfection in a glass. Sunrise stands up to the big boys coffee club all on its on.   Service: Everyone here seems to be in a good mood. Not a hello i'm forced to smile at you because its my job kind of mood, but genuinely happy. I think they actually enjoy working here...Weird i know.  They are knowledgeable and will explain all the ins and outs of whatever you order. I've said it before and ill say it again, HOSPITALITY earned Sunrise Coffee 5 stars. Everything else was great but that one point put them over the top.",

The baristas wear smiles and appear clean and professional. I was pleased to see assurances of organic products and fair-trade practices. I'd probably rate a three or four if I hadn't ordered a drink.  I asked the barista a few questions (e.g. \"What's the difference between the espresso and traditional menus?\") but she had difficulty answering any of them. Moreover, she seemed to resent my curiosity. (My friend had a similar experience a few days earlier when he called to ask about brew methods.) Still, I ordered a mocha and paid a fair price.  My drink came out after only a short time, but such timeliness hardly helped me appreciate the barista's handiwork. The mocha was overwhelmingly sweet (they use chocolate syrup, sauce, AND powder) and I've yet to detect the flavor of espresso.  I've explored some of Seattle's and Southern California's best coffee shops, and Sunrise comes nowhere close to the worst of these. I'll choose Starbucks over Sunrise anyday.",

    "text": "So i write this review from the couch in the corner looking over a relatively busy coffee shop in the middle of a Thursday afternoon. Seems like the go to spot for a cup of Joe, conversation with a friend, and a little place to sit and get some work done on the laptop (thats why im here).   Upon first entry you can tell this is a a regular spot for quite a few people as many seem to have their little places picked out, with their laptop cords ran all over and the comfort of knowing the employees as casual conversation flows all around. I find a spot first at the comfy deep seat chairs in the middle of the room and order my cup of coffee with a little flavor (white chocolate) in it to try and replicate my usual order from CBTL... my mistake as i should have just stuck with what was on the menu as it was too sweet. My next order was my lunch as i have been sitting here for the last couple of hours and i have been staring at photos of the wraps on their website so i asked them to make me their favorite. I have no clue what it was but it had beans in it and was certainly tasty as well as very healthy and really hit the spot. The service from the entire staff has been a pleasure with smiles and a solid attitude that makes you feel welcome. I think my next order to finish out my day will be the Americano which based on reviews will be nothing short of fabulous.   Overall i give Sunrise high marks for the atmosphere, service, and product they offer and the prices are not bad either at $6 for my lunch. I certainly will keep it on my stop for places to drop in for a little work or a casual conversation over a cup.",

The vegan bagels and hemp butter are as good as previous reviews stated and the coffee is excellent.   All coffees served are fair trade, organic and shade grown.  Try getting that anywhere else in town!  My wife Shawn and I visited twice in 2 days and the second day I was able to talk to the owner, Josh.  He's a great guy and extremely passionate and knowledgeable about coffee and running a sustainable business.  He also said that they are planning on adding an oven and will expand the vegan selections when they do.  I hope the people of Las Vegas will support Sunrise Coffee.  I know it took nerve and guts to start this business in a fairly hostile environment and it deserves to succeed.",

We've had a few things from this menu;  Alien burrito: Beans, hummus, cous cous, tomato, cheese, spinach bell peppers on a spinach tortilla. The flavor was good, though the balance was of ingredients was off..i;e there was an overload of spinach and not much else but that definitely depends on who's making the food.   Nom No,m burrito; I wasn't wowed by it. The flavor was lacking...I'd definitely give it 3 out of 5 alone. The idea is great but it just needs more seasoning.   This morning I had an everything bagel with vegan cream cheese.. I really love the fact that they have uncommon vegan breakfast options cream cheese. Their conscious effort alone gets them points in my book.   Fiancee had a tofurky sandwich on an everything bagel loaded with all kinds of goodies like vegan cheese and cream cheese, tofurky,,tomato, spinach and avocado. She really enjoyed it...it was loaded and had great flavor.   I can't say much about their lattes and hot coffee but I must say the ice coffee and frapps had good flavor but were inconsistent over the course of the weekend.  Overall I really love this place for the cute seating, chill ambiance and awesome friendly staff but I just think they need to step up the flavor game as well as making their food/drink taste more consistent.",

After the person in front of me was helped, it was at least one minute before anyone acknowledged that I was standing there. It's understandable if additional tasks need to be done before taking my order, but say to your customer, \"I'll be with you in just a moment.\" By not doing so, the customer feels awkward and you miss an opportunity to show you want their business.   No one introduced themselves. As a result, there was another missed opportunity to make a connection. A simple, \"Welcome to Sunrise Coffee. My name's ________, and you are?\" can go a long way toward making a loyal customer.   There was no conversation made. This is another missed an opportunity to build rapport with your customer. As a result, there was no relationship started. Try, \"How's your morning going so far?\" or \"Is this your first time here?\"  Overall, I was satisfied, but I have no compelling reason to make this a regular spot. If it's convenient, I'll go, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

Without being overly hipsterly annoying. The staff is very friendly, and willing to offer suggestions.  I have gotten the Nutella Coffee, half the sweetness and Almond milk- Sweet and chocolaty MMMmm!!  I'm only sad I moved. Whenever I visit it will surely be a place to stop!",

    "text": "Hands down the best coffee shop in town - the people who work there are super nice and really make you want to go back.   The drinks are delicious and a lot of thought went into them, especially ones like their S'mores milkshake (and yes, they can make that vegan). You can get classics like vanilla lattes or caramel fraps but there's a bunch of cool options on their menu like horchatas, tropical smoothies, or Nutella flavored beverages. My husband and I have been coming here for 3 years now. We've tried about half of their menu and there are so many good drinks that we're always ordering different favorites.  The food is super yummy and their food menu also breaks the traditional coffee shop mold. There are a ton of vegan and gluten free options. I'm a huge fan of the vegan versions of the Saucy Wench and Nom Nom Burritos. My husband likes the egg croissant sandwiches and the Morning Crumbles. The more run of the mill coffee shop treats like muffins are always moist and high quality. If you can get around to trying the vegan coffee cake, cinna rolls, or blueberry muffins I highly recommend it! They are the BEST if you ask them to warm it up for you. They also have vegan butter to go with it.   We go there often enough to recognize the different baristas but since they don't wear name tags I've never known who to name to leave a compliment for. I finally got around to asking some of them what their name was (and hopefully didn't sound too creepy!) - Michelle and May are consistently friendly, sincere and helpful. The two of them and the manager who does their woodwork, provide some of the best customer service experiences this city has to offer. The three of them are all really great and super nice. They really do make the experience.  Definitely try this place if you have a chance, the atmosphere is way better than a Starbucks and there's a 99% chance your drink will taste better! (:",

They remodeled and added tables for one, because to many folks are here solo with laptops. However, many people take up bigger tables even though they are alone. I kind of wish there was a sign politely asking the solo diners to try to use the smaller solo tables.  A small criticism, as this place is otherwise excellent.",

But - I'm passionate and just really love a good cup of joe.  Mae and crew are incredibly knowledgeable, service oriented, and just awesome. Whether you want a ristretto shot pulled properly, or a sweetened/flavored cup of comfort, this is the place to go. The shop is well designed and seems like a great place to hang out.

Equally welcome is the Hario V-60 as their chosen pour over device, it is just better than a Bonmac or similar device with a slow flow rate.  That said this is a scant four stars. The roasting and bean selection still has room to improve. This reviewer would like to see more brightness and fruit notes. The drinks are huge too, a Piccolo will net you a full 8 ounces of milk plus espresso. I was also slightly insulted when i asked about a Gibraltar or Cortado style drink that was not on the menu but the did have the proper glassware. I would have accepted \"no, sorry\" but i was told that because of the style of shots the do that their machines would have to be recalibrated to do that. Having worked in a coffee shop before i can tell you that's False.  Don't get me wrong, i do recommend Sunrise, the pastries are better and more affordable than say Sambalatte.

I am not a coffee drinker, but I frequent the Chi Tea Latte (both cold and hot) which is alway great. They have a good selection of classic teas as well. Many of my friends are big into fancy coffee drinks and they all love this place.   The Non Non Burrito is a really good lunch choice. It doesn't come with anything on the side, but the burrito itself is enough to fill you up.   The only negative I have to say about this place is that their vegan cookies are not entirely desirable. I'm not a vegan, but I couldn't get past how dry and crumbly they were. Many of their sweets options are very good, but then sometimes you run into a cookie like that.",

The coffee and tea menu is extensive and we chose a couple of lattes, I the spiced mocha, and the wife had the orange mocha. Both were expertly and efficiently made and tasted great. The wife also got a vegan carrot cashew muffin. It tasted alright to me, but she really liked it. I joked to her that you can barely taste the vegan that they put in the muffin, but I don't think that she got the joke.

It's nice that they use real coffee mugs and glasses. I also like the food (nom nom burrito, croissants with butter and jam, pumpkin muffin thingy). They have vegetarian and vegan options if you're into that. And I think they use free-trade, organic stuff, roast their own beans and use eco-friendly paper products.   They have a lot of seating and power outlets (plus free wifi!) for a small coffee shop but it does get crowded by mid afternoon. The outdoor patio area is nice with just enough shade and they have bowls for water and treats for my dogs.   The drive through is convenient, never slow, and they always give my dogs treats.   Yes there have been times when my order has come out slow or they forgot something but they've always made it right by giving me a free drink and owning up and apologizing. Get a stamp card too!",

Their pour-over menu isn't always the same, but I've been here more than handful of times. So far, my favorites are their Sumatra and Rwanda. I haven't tried any of their food, but it always looks really delicious. I've tried a few of their espresso drinks as well--I liked their Mexican mocha. Not too sweet and good flavor and creamy!  I like to come here to study, but it gets pretty crowded on the weekends sometimes, so it can be difficult to get a seat at those times. But there's usually at last some outdoor seating if you'd like to enjoy a cup of coffee and/or a meal with some nice weather. Inside, the environment is what you would expect and want from your typical coffee shop. Ample seating, good lighting, soft music playing in the background.",

    "text": "So, even though I've sworn off caffeine for the foreseeable future, I get talked into visiting a local coffee place by my girlfriend and my housemate. The girlfriend just wants to go because she's seized by a sudden need for a pastry, and my housemate wants to go because he is harboring entrepreneurial aspirations and wants to scout out the local market.  So, okay, I go. Never mind that this is like asking a newly-recovering alcoholic to take a tour of a winery. I go.  Sunrise Coffee Company sits just west of Pecos on Sunset Road and looks like your run-of-the-grinder Starbucks knock-off, except that their selection of snacks is even more limited. (So the Princess had to settle for a muffin!) But there's a BIG DIFFERENCE: they really know how to serve a beverage. They focus on quality ingredients to make drinks that would put the average green-aproned barista to shame.  Because I'm on the caffeine wagon, I order a peppermint tea, which irks me, because I just can't see paying a coffee price for something that's essentially made by dunking a bag of leaves into a cup of hot water. So, while the Princess raves about her mocha and my housemate raves about his latte, I get stuck with aromatic broth.  Then I take a sip....  Wow. The tea is pungent with mint and yet somehow manages to avoid the bitterness that often is the aftertaste of such herbal strength.  Which is to say I'm happy that I went to Sunrise Coffee Company and I hope they have continued success in their uphill battle against both the economy and Big Green. I plan to keep coming back.",

Ya, I'll even go as low to drink Maxwell House if it's sitting in a cup in front of me. That's where my \"addict\" part comes to play.   I am on the other hand a coffee snob. I distinctly know the difference between a decent, pure cup of coffee, and a bad cup of coffee. Good coffee has a robust taste, it is not exactly watery, nor is it creamy, it is a good in-between. Good coffee can be drunk without cream and sugar because the taste of the coffee is neither really bitter, biting, nor is it totally flat. The best coffee in my opinion comes fair-trade, organic, and brewed very well.   Sunrise Coffee has this kind of coffee. I was somewhat skeptical as to whether or not it would please me, even with the multiple Yelp reviews that say it is fantastic. But I confess, it was held up to all expectations and then some. I only ran in to grab a cup of coffee to go (I suppose I could have gone through the drive-thru, but I wanted to see the inside), but it is some of the best coffee I have ever, ever had. I have only had better coffee at a few coffee shops in Portland, Oregon.  I wish Sunrise was not so far away from me. I ran by there because I happened to be in the Henderson area. If it were closer to me I would absolutely be there many times a week. The inside is laid back with nice music, and a very inviting staff. And there is free WiFi! Woo hoo!  The only reason it does not get 5 Stars is because of the poor location. Not just because it is far from me, but because of the strip-mall location. I wish the owners might consider purchasing a building that is not in a strip-mall because this coffee shop begs to have its own building, set apart from other places.",

After 5  years, I picked up a Terry Pratchett and started leafing through it. The laid back vibe and the friendly surroundings make it so unique in a city like Las Vegas.  The decor is modern and every couch/table set was different...I spotted a couple of Ikea pieces (I'm an Ikea junkie like that) and there were some accent chairs...everything looked so cosy and comfortable and most importantly LOCALLY UNIQUE.  I ordered a small hazelnut latte...yummilicious...I didn't have to add anything to it...the waitress hand-delivered it to me. To eat, I ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich sans egg. It came with spinach leaves, avocado, cream cheese, slice of what seemed like provolone and tomatoes. Just the right, clean food for a good start to the day. It was delicious (never thought that such simple food would give me so much joy). The coffee and tea menu here is extensive and everything seems so well-thought of. They have a few burritos/sandwiches (all of which could be customized). I think I may hang here everyday.   The staff was hilarious...they whipped up my drink and food, served it to me at my table and they were so sweet. While I was eating, I heard their conversation behind the counter. Man, were they HILARIOUS....I can't really repeat what they were talking about due to the whole PC thing but let's say they had some very interesting and funny things to say. I loved these guys. Apparently, they have a drive through to...but I'm gonna stick with coming in since I love this place so much.   Honestly, they could have served me a dog biscuit and I would have still been in love with the place just because it's such a local gem. I wish they were open late...imagine having poetry nights, guitar players, wannabe Justin Biebers all getting their act on here.  Great coffee + Good Clean Food + The most laid back, relaxing backdrop makes this such a precious find in Las Vegas.",

Creme brulee latte-delish! I'm a coffee drinker, so I love how they have big mugs. Atmosphere is calm and relaxed, so not really a great place to have a full conversation with someone, unless you don't mind others listening in. Great art on the wall is a nice touch.

    "text": "In asking my brother where I should go for a light lunch, he suggested Sunrise. Thank you David, and thank you Yelp.  Coming from Seattle, I'd like to think I have some taste in coffee, yet my inability to handle coffee seems to contradict this. But iced nutella latte? I am in! Living the past year in Seattle, this place definitely makes me feel at home in a city that couldn't be any more different. Quaint, intimate, and welcoming - not to mention, the music selection! Indie music is always okay with me, especially when they play my favorites (they did).  Meeting up with a friend, we both ordered the Alien Burrito. Hers was regularly prepared, I ordered mine Vegan with vegan cream cheese and mayo. A few minutes later, a spinach tortilla wrap with refried beans, copious amounts of spinach, red pepper, hummus, and vegan condiments came out. A few moments after that, it was half-devoured, and I was already stuffed. It was delicious! The fare was reminiscent of Seattle - good food, fresh ingredients with a conscious state of mind.   My friend and I spent the next four hours just conversing, eating, and drinking. But what I enjoy the most is the friendliness of the staff. Never once did I feel uncomfortable or pressured to leave once I was done. They were polite in taking away our dishes, and left us to our own agendas. Quite frankly, the music had my won over from the first few minutes. With the food and staff in consideration, I may never leave.",

    "text": "THIS.   This is what coffee shops are supposed to look like (at least in my opinion!)  I've never walked into a coffee shop until Sunrise, and there's shelves of books to read at your pleasure. Books of all kind, non-fiction, fiction, do it yourself, educational. Coffee shops have a staple for being the place to go to become \"enlightened\", \"informed\", \"nerdy\". I was immediately fascinated by this when I was waiting for my nutella frapuccino. Wait, *nutella* frapuccino? Oh, yes. Might I add this is a genius coffee with the best of both worlds?  I don't believe every single item is of an organic and vegan quality (obviously creamers and milk aren't of vegan quality), but I love their outlook on presenting the best cup of coffee or tea in the most sustainable manner possible. I guess when you're already a tree hugger, you might get giddy about that. But seriously, it was more so the allure of the shop itself, with its shelves of alluring books, that drew me in more than the taste (and this isn't saying the taste was bad, it was really delicious!)  The tastes of coffee and teas here will appeal to your taste buds different, because yes, they use quality ingredients that aren't processed or haven't been loaded down with other preservatives or extra sugars (like some other yelpers noted). It's important to keep an open mind when crossing over from your local Starbucks into an organic, vegan certified coffee shop.",

I'm a morning coffee guy, so I've only gotten pastries, but I hear great things about the sandwiches.    On top of the great product offerings, the staff is tremendous.   They are super friendly and knowledgeable.  If you're looking to try something new or aren't very well versed on coffee drinks and the variety available, they are there to help.  I urge anyone and everyone looking for a new place to get coffee to try Sunrise.  You'll get a great product and great service while supporting a local business owner.",

For one: moisture (not counting in your armpits).  Another: good coffee.  No, no, no - GREAT coffee.  Well, that's not entirely True.  In Las Vegas, there are lakes, Italian villas, pyramids, all kinds of things that aren't supposed to be there.  Sunrise Coffee fits right into that category.  From its hand-lettered signs and its pretty cappuccino designs to it's quirky local art for sale and hand-doodled paper cups on display, Sunrise is a needle Starbucks-soaked haystack of corporatism.  It is sure to be appreciated by the more-than-average coffee lover, tattoos and all.  Free wifi, discount pastries in the afternoon, a variety of seating options make self-proclaimed snobs like me feel right at home.  Since all I had was a what I refer to as a \"frosty-blendy drink\" (of which there are many on the menu) and BF had a cappuccino, I can't give out the five star just yet.  Everything was great, but a standard cuppa drip taste test is in order.    Oh well, just another reason to go back to Vegas.",

Sunrise Coffee is on the opposite side of town for me, so to make the trip was questionable since I haven't been to this side of town for awhile.   After reading many great reviews and a friend recommending this place, I thought since I have the day off, why not explore. Great find!   I had the tofurkey sandwich and a matcha tea. The sandwich was good, and full! Avocado, nice thick slices of tomato, nice handful of spinach. I'm not a fan of siriacha in sandwiches, but instead cooked into a dish. Surprisingly I loved it as a sauce for the sandwich.  The tea was good, with no additional sugars. Just iced was perfect for a hot summer day in Las Vegas.   Everyone here is productive and not the typical gossip team behind the counter. When there were no orders, they were either cleaning up or checking up on customers.   It has a very hipster vibe from the customers themselves. But still a great place to dine in or eat out.   I'll come back when I'm in the area or have friends visiting.   Specify if you want vegan, vegetarian or gluten free. Most of the items are vegetarian, just request vegan if you are. There are vegan dessert options too...none stood out to me, so I decided to opt out the sweets for now.   Enjoy!!!",

For example today they told us that happy hour doesn't apply to drive through orders. Today is the first time I've heard that. I've been here many times before and ordered happy hour drinks through the drive through and never been told this. When we told the girl that helped us today this, she said that we were probably helped by people that didn't know that policy. Well it wasn't one or two occasions. It's been at least 30 occasions that I've gone through the drive through for happy hour and never been told this. Also, the girl that helped us today wasn't to happy. Maybe she was annoyed that we asked a lot of questions.    On one occasion the person helping me told me that lattes were not part of happy hour.   Also, you have to order a \"latte with vanilla\" instead of a \"vanilla latte\" to get a happy hour vanilla latte. Is it just me or isn't that sort of ridiculous?   Additionally the person helping us is different every single time. I think I've only seen the same person twice.   Sunrise coffee is almost a 20 minute drive from me, which I'm happy to make but not if service like this continues. I've been visiting less frequently in the last few months and I stopped recommending it to people because I'm not sure what kind of service they'll turn out for friends and family I send, especially since most people I know are coffee aficionados.",

Outlets are limited here (so pick your table wisely) & there's free self serving iced water. You will find many vegan & gluten free breakfast options. Once your are done with your drink & food, you can return both cups and plates at the pick up counter (you'll see a tray).  ***  Alien Burrito (tomato basil tortilla with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell peppers and ranch dressing, $6.75): Not sure whether I actually like tomato tortilla (pretty rough texture). Pretty good for veggie burrito - I could taste both sour cream and avocado. The portion was fairly big too.  Nutella Latte (hot, small 12 oz $3.70): Oh wow ... sometimes it only takes that one sip to determine how great the coffee is and this latte belongs to THAT category. Oh such a glorious drink - aroma, sweet, and creaminess were in perfect balance. Normally you would think Nutella is really sweet - well not with this cup of latte!  ***  Only few LA coffee shops can brew this amazing cup latte and it is worth a drive here just to try their hot Nutella Latte.",

When I walked in the door they had Very friendly staff ! I asked a lot of coffee questions (origin, pour overs they use, where they roast their coffee which is their other coffee roaster that belongs to them). I looked at the pastries and was astonished because most places have \"traditional\" pastries. They had traditional, but unique and nicely created presentation on pastors. Everything looked good and I like that they offered vegan items!! And so many! They nailed it 100% on the pastry selection for sure.   When i drank the coffee I ordered, black lightest roast, it had a lot of fruit notes in it. I loved that about it.! The croissant was.. wow... so perfect and delicious and fresh!!!!  They have free wifi and everything is set up for 2 tops and some larger tables. I love that! I cannot wait to come back!!!",

Inside of the coffee shop there is always great music playing. I've noticed that quite a few college students hang out here to work on assignments. It's also a great place to step away from all the hustle and bustle of this world. Outside of the coffee shop is a nice sitting area and they have plenty of chairs and benches. The best part is that you're shaded by beautiful plants. They also have outlets outside.  I would definitely recommend this shop.",

My favorite drink on the menu is the lavender matcha latte. It's so so good! I've tried many of their lattes & it's a little too sweet for my taste so I ask that they lessen the pumps they put in mine. My favorite food item is the croissant sandwich. I substitute veganaise for cream cheese. IDK why but there's just something about veganaise that I don't like lol. People rave about the nom nom burrito but I haven't tried it. I'm usually here in the morning so I don't really feel like having a burrito in the morning. Will definitely try though if I ever come here for lunch.   The workers are always very nice & sweet. Sometimes the food items take a little longer than expected but they're really nice about it. I'm glad this place is near my work!",

We both got hot Lattes which we're both perfect (I wish I can remember the names *slaps forehead*) and I got a cereal with lots of granola, dried fruits, nuts and seeds, and topped with fresh fruit. It was very good it felt very hearty but there were too many peanuts for my personal taste. If we go next time I might ask for no peanuts because then I can totally see me becoming addicted.

I was initially skeptical, because they are vegetarian, but they won this meat-lover over, the food was great! The staff were also very friendly and full of energy, a wonderful start to the morning!   I ordered the Shibuya Latte and Nom Nom Breakfast Burrito. The Shibuya Latte was excellent, the matcha flavor was strong and had an earthly flavor without any bitterness. This is exactly how a Matcha Latte should be made. The Nom Nom Breakfast Burrito was also so delicious, it was cut into two big slices, I managed to save the other slice for a snack on the car ride back home. The ingredients were fresh and good quality tasting.  My coffee connoisseur cousins enjoyed their coffee orders and even bought coffee bean bags for home bound, so it must have been that good. Overall, a great stop for coffee and breakfast before an early trip back home. I would definitely recommend and give them another visit.",

Overall, they have good coffee, a good amount of seating, and friendly staff.   My first time visiting, I ordered the butterbeer latte--  half sweet, with almond milk. SO GOOD! I also got avocado toast. I felt like the avocado toast was wayyy too salty that I could barely finish it.   This time around, I just ordered a regular coffee and their Hot Mess Bowl. Again, food was WAY TOO SALTY. Like there was a lot of salt and seasoning going on that my mouth couldn't handle it lol. I ended up just tossing it.   Aside from the food, everything else has been enjoyable. It's moderately loud in here. Nothing like Starbucks. They also have outdoor seating, which is cute. I also noticed that there's a flower stand going on right in front of the shop today (Saturday).",

It's a rough time of year but the food, the drinks, the staff have always been SUPER AMAZING.  Today I got my normal Black Tea Latte with Almond Milk, I like it hot but you can also get it cold.  I also ordered an Alien Burrito which for some reason I just really enjoy.  They told me it would take a good 10 to 15 minutes for the food because they were really crowded and only had one person working the kitchen at the time which was fine with me.  I was not in my seat for more then a minute and my tea came out and like two to three minutes later my food came out which was a great surprise.  The staff have always been friendly and welcoming and this is my favorite place for coffee/tea and this time of year they have a special drink menu with some amazing sounding drinks so I will be back before the next meetup to try one of those.   I highly recommend this place, it's great for free internet as well as the food, drink and staff....",

The flavor and quality of the coffee is great im glad that it didnt taste like just sweetened coffee. You could actually taste what they named the drink this time it was the smores latte hot which was just warm. It was very delicious but not as strong as I had hoped for. I got to also try out the Alabama latte which was also just at delicious and it was a weaker flavor compared to the Smores.    For the price and size its good I will be going again to give another them a try but it's gonna be about a month or two before I go again.",

I got a Shibuya latte and bagel with the works (forgot the name but it had an herb cream cheese and avocado). This was the perfect way to start the day early. The matcha latte had plenty of earthy flavor and creaminess without any bitter notes. The bagel was perfectly toasted and despite being in the smaller side, it was enough for breakfast. I would definitely return.  Pro tip: buy a bag of beans ($12+/less than a lb) and get a free coffee.",

They are the sister shop to mothership coffee so you already know that it's good.  We didn't know that walking in but were obviously pleasantly surprised.  This location is very cool with the sleek decorated inside and they've got an outdoor seating area with vines covering the walls, very cool.  As far as the coffee, drink and snacks to eat, they've got you covered.  My boyfriend opted for a latte where I ordered the matcha dipped croissant.  The coffee was great made by people who care and the croissant was very good as well.  It wasn't too sweet and was nice and flaky.  We also took some fresh roasted beans to go.  The girl helping us out at the counter was so nice and friendly, helping us choose the beans that we wanted.  As far as other food in the case, they did have some very good looking vegan items which next time we plan to try.  It looked like a cinnamon roll with strawberry frosting among other things.  Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Just wow!  Sunrise Coffee came up on my list of places to review and I was shocked I hadn't expressed my love for one of the best coffee shops around town yet!  This spot has something for everyone and I mean that in every sense of the word.  Whether you're looking to fuel up with a specialty latte (of which there are many delicious choices!) with your laptop in the shade or you'd like to sit in their little garden space with a double espresso, they've got you covered... or uncovered!  Speaking of garden space, Sunrise Coffee has one of the prettiest little outside areas I've seen in the valley. It is many an IG user's dream and doesn't surprise me that it's always popular, even in the hotter months!  So let's talk about the most important thing about a coffee shop.. the coffee. Did I say 'wow' already?! Their coffee is phenomenal in any form and every time I grab a cup here, I wonder why I don't come here more often.  I haven't tried many of the food items yet, but I can vouch for the fact that their turkey sub is amazing! To be honest, it was my partner's sandwich as I didn't think I even liked turkey, but Sunrise was quick to prove me wrong. Delish!  What a great little spot! With friendly staff, many food & drink options and an inspiring space, it's definitely worth your while if you're in the area!",

It is a fairly small team, I enjoy every single employee there, as well as seeing familiar faces each time I go.  Most if not all food items can be made vegan. The tofurky sandwich, croissant egg sandwich, hot mess bowl and beautiful bowl are my favorite things to eat.  The coffee is also great, and so are the tea lattes (must try: London fog latte). Sunrise will always have a very special place in my heart!   (I have combined pictures that I have taken throughout the years)",

Another girl standing near me had waited 30 minutes by time I left. You'd think since this place is surrounded by hundreds of business offices they'd get their hustle on so customers can get to work.  As for the burrito. Regularly comes with tomato basil tortilla, eggs, beans, potatoes, cheese, spinach, tomatoes, avocados, cream cheese and sour cream. Sounds great. If you request it to be made vegan, they sub the egg for tofurkey?? Not even close to a match, no longer even a breakfast burrito, and should be mentioned upon ordering.

I got it over ice with oat milk and light pistachio syrup, since I hate overly sweet drinks. It was perfect! The earthiness from the matcha, creaminess from the oat, and the nutty sweetness from the pistachio was sooo good. I also got an iced lavender latte with oat milk, and that was tasty as well. The lavender syrup was a bit bitter, but the coffee flavor still shined through. Yum.   When I went in at 2 pm on a Tuesday, there were tons of people inside working with their laptops and meeting with friends. I can definitely imagine this place getting crowded during the weekends. If I lived in Vegas, this I could see this being my go to coffee place because of the creative coffee/tea drinks, free WiFi,  nice service, and ample indoor and outdoor seating.",

    "text": "I walked into Sunrise and knew I had come to the right place. Great decorations, baristas were friendly and hip. I felt much better here than on the strip.   Me and a bunch of my buddies were headed through Vegas to hit up some National Parks (Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce). We needed some fuel (both for the car and ourselves) before hitting the road and Sunrise hit the spot. I had an orange iced mocha, my friends had nutella latte frappe thing - Stop. Re-read.   Yes I wrote Nutella Latte. You didn't misread that. And yes, that is amazing. Nutella is the lifeblood of all things great in this world, and to add it to coffee, the mere idea of it is enough to bring a grown man to tears. Simply put, the drink was good.  We also had some breakfast burrito's that were pretty solid, they could have been more spicy but hey, it was pretty damn good.   It was a bit pricey (maybe the norm for Vegas?), but the atmosphere and interesting drinks sold me on the place.   Truthfully, this place is 4 stars in my mind, but really I felt like it was a special place in Las Vegas, and I suggest making the trek.",

Since we've been customers for so long this review comes after not once, twice, or even three times of our order being messed up - this is coming after #4. The three biggest errors have been giving me dairy on my vegan bagels/burritos, and with 5 years of ordering food dairy free I know these haven't been my mistakes. The most enraging experience was when regular cream cheese came on my bagel, I took a bite, and spent the rest of the day with cramps and bubble guts (Yep, from one bite).  So, cool, they can't get an order right anymore, but the service is terrible lately too minus a few familiar faces from OG baristas. It's one thing to make a poor excuse for an iced hazelnut latte (literally making drinks is your job?) but a whole other thing to be super rude when all I wanted to do was exchange it for something drinkable.   I did stop ordering anything besides pre-made diary free pastries and tried to switch to cold brew to prevent further drink errors but somehow was charged $5.90 for a medium cold brew in my own cup & won't be going that route anymore. So in short, if you care about service and receiving the food you actually ordered steer clear. There are other, much better coffee shops not too far.",

Unlike Sambalatte at Boca Park, this place is larger, less clutter, and more room to walk around without bumping into other tables!  There's also more variety for this specialty coffee shop.  The days of Starbucks are pretty much done for me, unless I'm in Seattle at the original Starbucks.    The beverage minimum is simple but unique, the food menu display a nice variety for everyone, from vegetarian to meat eaters.  My favorite by far is the Butterbeer latte, ice and hot, but mainly ice...I'm an icy person!  As for food, now I'm not a vegetarian by any means because I LOVE my meat but their Nom Nom Burrito is filling and delicious to any carnivore, it has tortillas, eggs, vegetarian beans, potatoes, cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, avocados, sour cream and a bit of cream cheese.    This place definitely is the best and every time I know I am going to be in that area, I route my day around it so I can make a pit stop there for some Butterbeer latte!  I just wish they open a second one closer to my mansion home!",

Every time I'm in town, it's become mandatory to make a stop here.   FOOD(drinks): Every latte concoction I've tried here has been excellent. My favorite is the Creme Brulee.. perfectly sweetened, but not over doing it, with a strong espresso taste. The best when iced! I've also tried the Nutella, Butter Beer, & Mexican Mocha. All tasty drinks and definitely worth a try. They offer all different milk types including Soy, which is free, and Almond Milk! I haven't tried any of their food or snacks but they have a pretty decent selection and I see people eating in all the time so it must be good.  AMBIANCE: Great coffee shop feel without being Hipster dirty. Always busy with people reading, working, or socializing.  SERVICE: Genuine, friendly employees. All very personable and welcoming. It's awesome how some of them remember you even if you're not a local. If they ever make a mistake, they're really cool about it and will fix whatever they messed up on.   TIPS: Iced Soy Creme Brulee Latte is my favorite. Don't be afraid to try any of their other drinks. They're all really good!",

Now, maybe that place helps me tap into my inner hipster...I don't know, but I like it.   The food, beverages and service aren't bad either(hehe). The people who work there are always so friendly. My Ben loves coffee - more than me and I'm okay with it as long as it's from Sunrise. His favorite drink there is an iced vanilla, hazelnut, soy latte. I enjoy my soy chai latte. Of course, they have vegan food options. Ben is a huge fan of the veganized Alien Burrito. The Nom Nom is quite delicious as well. If we make it there in the morning, I'll order their \"everything\" bagel with tofutti. If we're running a little late, their tofurky sandwich is usually my first choice.   My experience is magical each and every time I visit. There's no better place in Southern Nevada to get your independent coffee house groove on than at Sunrise Coffee.",

It is a bit of a drive from my home, but it is absolutely worth it! I always get the London Fog with almond milk, and their egg croissant sandwich is to die for! Everything is fresh and free from being microwaved. Keep up the amazing work!!",

I did like the water station with lemon water in a nice self service bar.  Nice touch, especially for someone that doesn't drink anything other than water more than not.  I ordered a breakfast croissant.  The croissant was nice and flaky and all ingredients were fresh.  The sandwich was a little on the high side for a breakfast sandwich, but it was a good size and filling.  I would meet a friend here again when I need to have \"coffee\" with someone.    I wouldn't normally leave a yelp, since I am not really a coffee drinker, but was surprised and happy to see such a thriving little spot on the east side.",

The coffee is beautifully roasted, not oily or heavy or burnt. The staff were all very generous with me as a first timer, even though it was busy, they took the time to explain anything i asked of them. The food here is delicious, healthy and priced right! Not to mention beautiful to look at. The photos on Yelp are True to life, everything looks and tastes that beautiful! You will not be disappointed.   The atmosphere was great and i loved the outdoor seating area with it's quirky wooden chairs and generous shade. I also loved that this place is located right across from a park, it's be great for moms with kids to pop in before taking the kids to play.   Totally in love with this place and will be back soon.",

    "text": "WHERE SHOULD I START?! I remember seeing this place for at least three or four years and praying that they'd stay open being that it's a local coffee place in a deserted strip mall. Don't know why I never went in till this past winter and HOW I REGRET NOT GOING IN SOONER! I go too much now! (Even had to make a Mint budget for this place- I'm that bad lol!)  LOVE all their gourmet coffees.  Favs: Mexican Mocha, Creme Brulee. (The only one I don't care for is the Truffle Berry one. But it's my boyfriends favorite!)  Really diggin their iced teas, favs: Orchard tea... went in yesterday though and I guess it's changed to the south western or something? Forgot the replacement's name. Their Passion tea as well.  Their Green Tea Iced Latte is really delicious too!  Some picky pros: they offer almond and rice milk for the coffees (I don't like cow's milk much). I also like their different options of sweetener for the teas as well; raw for me. They have some glasses with a water dispenser that you can help yourself to at any time. They have a drive-thru!!! Praise the Lord for this on the days that I'm running late to class/work!  Their happy hour is wonderful- starts at 5pm- dollar reg. coffees and pastries! Love getting their vegan coffee cake, blueberry scones, chocolate chip pumpkin muffin.  The atmosphere is cool, great place to study when it isn't too busy. The weekends can get a little crazy but it's worth it. The sweet owners lurk around and hang out there. I do miss the loveseat-like couch they had in one corner but the new L-shaped bench definitely accommodates more people. The outside patio is really cute. They make the furniture, neat-o.  Lastly, their staff is just lovely. Everyone is very nice and outgoing!! It's just got a very warm feeling every time I go in there. That's what I can appreciate about a place: when you make a customer having a bad day peel a smile on their face. Service!  *I do wish they had a way to look up their nutritional info/ingredients, etc. pleeease? ;)",

The espresso is fantastic with plenty of \"crema\" on top. I don't know how they do it, but the finished product appears almost caramelised . Take it from someone who has lived in Italy and knows good espresso , etc.. This coffee is fantastico ! Oh, and I must give kudos to the coffee roaster and baristas .. The best !!",

I ordered a small Nutella Latte, Cinnamon bagel with cream cheese, 2 chocolate milks for the kids, and another cinnamon bagel with strawberry jam for my daughter and croissant for my son. I was greeted with a warm smile and great way to start the day. I like that they make their chocolate milk for the kids because my son and daughter's  eyes opened wide with excitement since it looked like a fancy big kid drink opposed to the tiny boxed milk. Overall. Great Service, Delicious Drinks and Food, and Affordable. Will definitely be coming back more often.",

    "text": "Situated just a few miles away from UNLV lies Sunrise Coffee, the third of  The Rebel Yell's independent coffee shop explorations. Located across the street from Sunset Park, just down Sunset Road. You can visit Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.  From an initial glance just driving by, the spot might not look like much -- but then I suppose what coffee shops do? A closer inspection reveals a wholesome little abode with a quaint little patio containing oddly awesome tables, and a sticker on the door proudly proclaiming its fair trade coffee usage.  The coffee house is populated with various art pieces, comfortable chairs (especially important for long study sessions), a couch and a bookcase full of reading material.  An initial glance at the menu left me in quite a conundrum -- did I want the Nutella or creme brulee latte? A tropical frappe or peach iced tea? The \"Candy Cane\" holiday espresso looked great too. With all these decisions, I decided to ask the barista, and ended up with the Nutella latte, iced, and also decided to give the \"Alien Burrito\" a try.  The Nutella latte was absolute deliciousness -- a blend of indulgent decadence,  perfectly balanced with the espresso. My only regret was not getting a larger size. Fortunately, while Sunrise strives for wholesome, organic food and coffee, their prices are still very reasonable, with a large 20 ounce gourmet latte only running $4.45, and the same size frappes only going for $4.85. Why do I ever go to Starbucks?  Next up was the \"Alien Burrito\" (full title: \"Aliens Left a Burrito in the Middle East\"),  made up of couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell pepper, cilantro and ranch, all housed within a spinach tortilla. Most know me as a bit of a carnivore, but despite a lack of meat, this burrito was delicious. And if you look at the ingredients, you can see why. The best part? It runs about the same price as a burrito at Chipotle or a sandwich at Subway.  I don't know why I ever had the whole \"Oh, organic? It'll probably be overpriced\" misconception, but Sunrise Coffee has quickly changed that. And it's not just because of their prices, but the atmosphere, the excellent coffee and food as well.

Aside from the fact that it's one of those rare-in-Vegas artsy-farsty bohemian hangout-type coffee shops, with bookshelves full o'crappy old paperbacks and lots of comfy seating...it also serves A*M*A*Z*I*N*G food! I had the \"Aliens Kidnapped a Burrito From the Middle East\" and it was nothing short of jaw-dropping! Crammed full of healthy shit like fresh spinach leaves, avocado, couscous and hummus...very hard to find quick, healthy eats like that, and it was only $5.99.  I will DEFINITELY be spending more time here. It's become a destination thing for me -- if I ever happen to be in that part of town, I will make a point to go there. It was that good!! I can't say enough fabulous things about this place!!",

The service here was good - friendly staff who are efficient in taking your order.  I got my Nutella latte right away and it really tasted like the name implies.  Delicious!  My Alien burrito took a little while to make and I'm not sure if it usually is like that, but it was worth the wait.  For an all vegetarian item, it really filled me up.  Maybe a little too much because I had to have dinner with my friend an hour later, but I'm not complaining.    If I lived in Las Vegas, I would be at Sunrise a lot.  Check them out!",

We had ordered a kids hot chocolate and it was a little too hot and they remade one for us without even asking. We had also asked for extra plates and an employee brought them right to our table. An employee also walked by our table and offered us all a glass of water! Amazing coffee and amazing service! I will be back!",

Upon arriving, we weren't greeted very warmly compared to other customers who appeared to be regulars. A seedy dive bar server would have been nicer. I ended up ordering a small jasmine tea latte with almond milk and a croissant egg sandwich. My friend ordered the same drink with a vegan alien burrito.  The lattes we ordered weren't anything to rave about, but it may be because of the almond milk itself. When our food was brought out to us, the server was kind enough and the portions were very big. I guess the food is supposed to be cold, even for a breakfast croissant, but it was good. I like the fact that they use veganaise instead of regular mayo. My friend, on the other hand, was struggling to enjoy her burrito (mostly because she's a paranoid vegan). It was assembled unevenly, so she freaked out when she came across the beans at the bottom.   Overall the service and drinks are subpar, but the atmosphere and food made up for it.",

Todays coffee is single-bean, sustainably-sourced from Guatemala. I am not a coffee nut, but they were so proud to tell me about the coffee, so I listened. And now, I think I care a little but more.   Food, atmosphere and people are all vegan-friendly, but not in that judgemental, over-bearing way. They're just happy. The music is happy. The tip jar is happy, and unsurprisingly overflowing.   Food is good (3.5 stars) but the atmosphere is overpowering positive. I'm 5 stars even before I took a sip or a bite.",

I prefer chilling and sipping on their personal collection of different roasts to offer. My favorite snack to grab is the Peanut Butter jelly & banana time sandwich.  Background Music changes daily and/or possibly depending on the time of day. Sometimes it's golden oldies, pop music or classic rock.  Only one bathroom but it is always clean.

Their sign/logo is very simple & plain. But when you walk inside, it's a very earthy/chill looking coffee shop.  They have a lot of options to choose from, so I asked the barista what their bestsellers are for someone who likes sweet drinks. She recommended 3 Lattes: Nutella, Creme Brulee, and Butterbeer. I chose Butterbeer.  Having a super sweet tooth, this wasn't too sweet for me.. and I wish I asked for an extra pump of sweetness or something. Caramel/butterscotch was good, Cinnamon was very pungent, which could be a pro or con.  Overall, my beverage was good. Now I'm keen to try their Creme Brulee & Nutella.  I came here during lunch time, so majority of the tables were taken by people on their laptops/studying. They have a cute little seating area outside, but that's where all the smokers sit.  I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in the area to try their other lattes, and their infamous Alien Burrito.",

It's vegan and stuffed with lots of fresh ingredients (like avocado, spinach, and tomato), quinoa, hummus, beans, and vegan mayo. It's my favorite burrito of all time. For a drink, we got lavender lemonade which was more floral than lemonade - not my thing.  Drake (non-vegan): I was pretty impressed - it was a good burrito! The lemonade was alright.   The only issue was that we waited too long for one burrito (we split one because Ally can't finish one by herself, it's too big). If we could, we would rate it 3.5 stars.",

Their pastries are delicious and they only offer them till they're gone, so you know you're always getting something fresh!  They have a cute patio that is shaded, so it's ideal for the hot Vegas summers if you're like me and still want to sit out on a patio to enjoy your morning or afternoon coffee. It also helps that it's super cute and perf for to brag on social media about where you're currently at.   Unlike most local coffee shops, they even have a drive through, which my coworker and I used to frequent on our way to and from the office. Superb if you're in a hurry! I've never waited more than 5 or 6 minutes in the drive through.",

I ordered their Pistachio latte and was incredibly happy with that decision. I've had different varieties of Nut lattes before but there's something quite unique about using a Pistachio syrup as it generally falls in line with what I like in a latte - it's a sweet and creamy nut as opposed to something like a Hazelnut which tends to be a little more 'Earthy'.",

Almond raspberry scone, a variety of quiches, vegan fare, vegetarian friendly and very nice staff and patrons.   It's always busy with plenty of indoor and patio seating.   Support you local small businesses, especially this one.   Peace!",

A great atmosphere to study and hangout. Prices were amazing!! My whole purchase totaled to $13. And thats the price I basically spend on starbucks.

I first heard about Sunrise Coffee when I asked my coworkers, \"Where can I get coffee off Sunset that isn't Starbucks?\" Another suggested \"Sunrise Coffee.\" Then another replied \"Oh, that hipster hangout?\"   Yes, this spot does indeed attract the local hipster crowd - more so than other spots away from downtown. What is it that brings them here? Is it the good coffee and free wi-fi? Is the college study crowd serving coffeehouse seating arrangement? Perhaps the nearby park where you can play frisbee golf...?  I typically get an almond milk latte with an extra shot to tide me through that 2 o'clock feeling and it doesn't disappoint.

    "text": "I am rarely on the SE side of Las Vegas, thus rarely gets to visit or review any businesses in the area.  But Aug 17, 2010 was one of those rare days when I get to explore the SE side of Las Vegas.   After ramen at Yokohama Kaigenro, then a brief stop at Seafood City, we eventually ended up here at Sunrise Coffee. From the outside it didn't look very impressive. However, that changed immediately after opening the door and stepping into this coffee house with a warm and inviting aura.  The lady behind the counter was patient and cheerful in helping answer questions for us first timers.  I ended up ordering their Superfruit Antiox ($4.45), and it was simply tasty and very refreshing. It definitely hit the spot on another 100+F day in Vegas. If you Yelp or check out Yelp reviews, you will undoubtedly also see their promotion for a free traditional cappuccino (2 oz. espresso, 2 oz. milk, 2 oz. foam, but their version is larger and served in an 8 oz cup), as long as you show them your UNLV student ID. This promotion is for Aug 2010, and I am sure they will have something else for each month of the year.  If you are into latte art, they do that too, even on the free cup of cappuccino.  The decoration is cheerful, and some of the walls are adorned with art works from local artists, just like at many coffee houses across the country.  They also have a bookshelf full of books (ranging from techie books, aka A+ Study Guide, to various genres of novels), perfect for relaxing with some light reading material while enjoying a cup of joe or other tasty beverages.  They also serve sweets, like danishes and cookies, which are $1 after 4pm (if I remember it correctly). But usually by that time of day, their selections are rather scarce (because their is only 1 cookie and 1 danish left when we arrived).  While I was here with another Yelper, there was a decent group of ladies of varying ages + 1 man, who was part of a knitting club.  It was cool to see that groups like that have a nice neighborhood hangout to meet at and enjoy their activities, and shooting the breeze.  I give this cool coffee house a 4 stars for the friendly service, cool inviting ambiance, tasty beverages.  I too wish they can xerox themself to another location in the SW, so I don't have to make quite the  pilgrimage to enjoy the atmosphere and refreshing beverage.",

I was very hesitant about the Tofurky but it tastes pretty much like turkey!  The sandwich tasted very fresh which is why I give it 5 stars!  I also had to try out the Hakuna Tea Latte, since I have seen a few reviews on how amazing it was. I substituted for Almond Milk and it was to die for. I was close to getting another one! It was that addicting!  It was quite busy during the time we went but not too busy to the point where we had to wait for a table to be cleared. I'm surprised it's doing well only because the location that they are currently at seems dead. The shopping center I guess you can say doesn't have much foot traffic compared to the actually coffee shop but that's okay, it won't stop me from coming back again!   I definitely recommend trying it out! Especially the Hakuna Tea Latte!",

My impression was that the team behind Sunrise Coffee cares very much about creating an experience that their customers will love, and that was certainly how it was for me. Looking forward to going back!",

Also love the fact that they are food conscious (organic, local, fresh, vegan, gf, sustainable) Just had my first sammich from there, gf multigrain w/egg!!! Holy faaaack was that tasty! I've been gluten free for about 10 yrs and never had gf bread that crazy good before. Ever!   Just wanted to shout it out about the raddest coffee shop in the nation! Thanks for feeding my cravings and then some!   (Plus I should add, that the entire staff is always super friendly!

A gift.  I was speechless. I swear it just doesn't get any better than this.  Blue Bottle or Philz in San Francisco are the creme of the crop and Sunrise Coffee is right up there with them. Royalty.  I have been to Mothership Roaster's, I know it's the sister or momma company, the place is beautiful but there is just something really stupendous about Sunrise. The Vibe, The staff, the fairy dust maybe?  I dunno.  Just get your fanny down there to try it out for yourself  Id give you more Stars if I could!! (Insert Heart Emoji Here)",

They peppy and enthusiastic and before long I had my tea ((chamomile, peppermint, and one other thing I can't recall)), and it did just the trick!  First of all, it was delicious. Second, my anxiety melted away, to a point where I pulled out my sketchbook and doodled without worry. Third, it worked SO WELL that I was straight up falling asleep when my friend drove me home.  Expect another visit from me, soon. I need to know what was in that tea. Such magic.   Kiki",

It's a quaint little hipster joint in the middle of nowhere on Sunset but it's well worth the trek cause let's be honest, no one lives around where it's located.  The menu offers plenty of options for coffee beverages and foods. They are able to make most items regular, vegetarian, or vegan. So everybody wins!  The alien burrito is seriously addicting. Coming from a meat and rice girl, I love this dish and am fully satisfied with everything in it. It's just deliciousness wrapped up in a red or green tortilla.  This place has spoiled me though. Because their lattes are so good, it's hard to order a latte elsewhere now because you know it just won't be as good as the Sunrise lattes.  So if you're in the area and want some yummy coffee or food, or even if you aren't, Sunrise Coffee won't disappoint.",

We grabbed a couple of seats at the long table by the front door and started chatting with our table mates; this is something that other coffee places in Vegas don't have or encourage IMO.    My latte was lovely, creamy, and smooth while hubby's espresso was \"better than Sambalatte's.\"  We wanted to buy a pound of espresso beans, but were told that they wouldn't have any to sell until 9am the next morning.  \"That's too bad,\" we bemoaned, \"as we live on the complete other side of town.\"  To our complete delight, Mikey said he'd bag a pound for us right then and there.  And he did!  And we bought!  And now we're at home ready to indulge once again.   Thank you for going out of your way for us, Sunrise.  See you soon!",

I had a bite off their cookie as I was splitting it in half - OMG...that cookie was SO GOOD. The kind of good that gets described with profanities. F@king YUM!!!!  Brownie was pretty damn good too, and while I'm at it - so was my chai tea. I'm going to be making more visits to this place as there are many more things I'd like to try. What is this alien burrito/wrap thing I keep reading about???  I must find out.   Sunrise Coffee, we're about to become BFF's.",

So don't be fooled by it's cover, inside is modern and extremely well kept with a gorgeous outdoor seating area. It completely takes you out of the area and the fact that you are essentially sitting in a parking lot. Doesn't feel like it at all. AND the coffee is great!!! No complaints at all, can't wait to go back. Especially since it's so conveniently located across from Sunset Park, where I take my dog all the time.",

After becoming a coffee snob while living in Europe, I returned to Vegas hoping to find a really good cup of coffee that came close. There coffee here surpassed my coffee in Europe and is served with a smile, which I didn't get in Europe.  I highly recommend their latte, hot or cold, Dirty Chai (where Chai tea meets the amazing espresso) or their fantastic cappuccino. Really you can't go wrong. The coffee is wonderful, the staff is friendly and you'll be really happy that you gave this place a try.",

    "text": "Pretty Freaking disappointed. An establishment can have the BEST food and drinks in the world, but if the service isn't up to par, then customers will either never get to experience the phenomenal food/drinks or never return and this is exactly what happened to us. My mother and I stopped in this coffee shop curious as to the options. I've been here before but when they very first opened, what seems like many years ago. Anyways, we haven't been so it felt like an entirely new experience with new drinks and foods etc. We approached the counter and asked a few questions. My mother asked if they carried any Organic dairy free milk? the guy answered that none were organic except for one the soy. My mom said oh man, okay let me think. He kept saying to get soy or dairy, but my mom can't have soy or dairy due to an allergy. She then said \" would it be okay if I tried the rice and almond before I pick?\" and the guy goes \" well whats the magic word?\" and my mom said \"what?\" and he said \" PLEASE! please is the magic word. you have to be nice if you want it, we normally don't do it.\" First of all, my mom was EXTREMELY kind, just asked a questions and 2nd she's a 50 something year old woman not a child. Who does this guy think he is? This slender tattooed man had the nerve to be a smart ass ( excuse my french)  and condescending while dealing with an older and new customer. He goes to pour the rice milk and GUESS WHAT!? the RICE MILK IS ORGANIC! so my mom goes \" I thought you said only soy was organic thats organic too.\" He looked at it and just goes \" Oh , i dont read the labels.\" Really? you work at a food place and you don't read the food labels or know about that food? What a joke.   we left the cup he gave us and walked out.   We definitely wont be back, and wont be recommending this place to our friends in the area. Unfortunately, an establishment can be wonderful but customer service is what makes a business thrive in the long run.",

We've been searching all over Vegas for a great roaster because we needed to purchase a couple of pounds for our Aeropress at home. We decided to taste test two different variations of their \"Mothership\" coffee by trying one French Press and one drip coffee. The coffee taste was a huge disappointment. It tasted like diner coffee ( Yuban came to mind). Even though their coffee bean taste was incompatible with our palettes.... We Did Like the Staff, the interior layout of coffee shop (but not the ripped up couches), and we liked their muffins and cookies.  We will try this place again to see if their coffee bean flavor improves...or order a flavored drink that mask the sour coffee bean taste.",

I have to agree that their food options are superb. I love the alien burrito and the nom nom burrito-it is so hard to find a cafe that has good vegetarian options, but here they have many! Their coffee isn't so great in my opinion (bitter/acidic), but their teas are awesome and their new cold brew coffee is actually really good.  I love the atmosphere here because it has that local Portland-esque coffee shop vibe. They also have an awesome patio and are right across the street from Sunset Park.  The only frustrating thing about this place is that you can never find anywhere to sit if you don't get there early enough (before 10am). Time to expand!",

There's tons of seating because the tables are extremely tiny, but the place is so busy that you might not find a seat anyways (we went around 1-2 pm, which i guess is lunch hour, and we took the last two seats).

I initially decided to give it a try after a friend let me know they have vegan and gluten free options. I was really excited to see what kind of options they have for me since Las Vegas is not very veg-friendly. Unfortunately, they offer some vegan options and some gluten free options, but only their gluten free granola is vegan as well. I was pretty bummed my first visit because I was informed they were out of the granola I could have. Because I was really hungry, I opted for a banana and a side of cashew butter and a fancy coffee.  The latte I received was beautifully presented, and I love that they serve drinks in mugs rather than wasting paper and plastic. I was really impressed by their customer service. Since they were out of the granola that day, the cashier was kind enough to give me a card for two free food items my next visit. Even more impressive, he apparently found some granola after I sat down and brought it to me with almond milk; on the house. So amazing! I honestly could care less that the only option for me is the granola because it's incredibly good. Furthermore, their employees are so great I would go just for that reason.  I highly recommend trying out this locally owned, independent coffee shop. They use biodegradable cutlery and plastic cups, offer organic, fair trade coffee, and high quality, organic loose leaf teas. The only thing missing are a few different vegan AND gluten free pastries, hint hint ;)  Thanks Sunrise, you ROCK!!",

    "text": "As Norah Jones famously sang, \"Sunrise, sunrise/looks like mornin' in your eyes...\" Yes. I have morning in my eyes with a drink and a wrap from Sunrise Coffee.  I've always heard amazing things about this place. I've also seen tantalizing pictures of beautiful coffee creations. I was really excited that I had some time to stop by and see what the commotion was about.  I was starving and decided to get a wrap. My friends advised me to get the Alien Burrito. It's a perfect blend of beans, lettuce, tomato, quinoa and red bell peppers in a tomato-tortilla wrap.  I'm not sure what they used to flavor the quinoa and the beans, but it's absolutely delicious. They don't skimp out on the size of the wrap either. I ate half before my workout and the other half post-workout. The most perfect vegetarian wrap I've ever had!  I didn't get to try any their coffee drinks, but my friend just had just ordered a cup. It's really a work of art. The designs they get on their creations are really pretty. So pretty in fact that I wouldn't want to drink it! But I ended up getting their Italian soda flavored with raspberry and passion fruit. This was only $2. Light and refreshing. Not too sweet. Perfect compliment to my Alien burrito.   Ambiance is great. A quaint and little shop with good seating. They even have a little bookshelf full of books. Not noisy like your typical coffee shop - you can actually hear what people are saying to you! There were a handful of people studying here as well. I wish I had known about this place during my undergrad days. I wouldn't have been studying there too!  While I was standing in line, I saw that there was a little sign. Something about how they have Happy Hour from 5-8 PM which their small coffee is $1. Win! Whether I get their $1 coffee or pretty latte in the near future, I know I'll be happily sipping with a smile on my face.",

They are located on Sunset under the arrival path to 25L at McCarran. (Thankfully during my one drive-thru LAS was landing north!). The iced coffee is good and strong. The Nutella latte is very sweet. My favorites were the cappuccinos that I had in house. More than one barista here can pull a great shot. And skill at latte art is appreciated by me. There is a nicely decorated outdoor seating area, especially thoughtful considering its strip mall parking lot view. They've created a very pleasant space. The inside is spacious and well-lit, with eclectic art and good seating. I hung out here twice enjoying my beverage, and I can tell you it's very comfy. So glad they are here. I'll be back next time I'm in town with a car!!",

I've enjoyed Mothership Coffee Roasters coffee before (that's what Sunrise Coffee House serves), although this cup wasn't as tasty as the one I had at The Beat Coffeehouse & Records. Either the bean was different (I had the Peruvian bean), or it was brewed differently.  The coffee shop itself is vibrant and lively, and the patrons and staff were helpful. I'll come back to Sunrise Coffee House for another cup the next time I'm in Vegas. I have a feeling a repeat performance might result in a more rewarding experience.

The tortilla is really good and I even learned how to make it at home (because I craved it so often and it's easy to make) So I recommend getting that.   Their coffee is also amazing. They have different seasonal lattes and mochas so things never get boring and they always top it off with beautiful latte art.  I recommend getting the spicy mocha it has a hint of cayenne pepper. I've also had their spring jasmine iced tea in the summer and with a hint of honey or agave it is delish!   The music isn't too loud and there aren't blenders going off every five seconds. It's nice to go to read a book or study.   I definitely go back for the overall atmosphere and the quality of the coffee/eats.",

Ample and easy parking, came here straight from my red eye flight from McCarran airport, I ordered their drip coffee and vegan nom nom burrito. Ambiance is adorable and there is patio seating outside with a living wall. Sat down and waited about 10min for my order, I was a excited about my burrito. When I ate it, it was ok. Nothing exciting, no really flavorful components, just ingredients wrapped up in a tomato tortilla and served cold. I've had vegan burritos everywhere so maybe a harsher critic, but it just didn't do it for me flavor wise. The vegan mayo spread was a little thick so overpowered any of the freshness I wanted in a plant based burrito. I'll come back to try other dishes, really enjoyed the atmosphere but didn't care too much for the burrito",

Everyone respectful of each other to the point a single guy was sitting at a 4 person table, and put up a sign that invited others to sit there with him, so as not to tie up 4 seats by one guy.   I'm pretty happy with this experience.  Sticky bun was awesome.   I will come back when I'm the area for sure.",

I ordered an ice truffleberry latte. It's a very mild flavor and smooth. My husband ordered a Mexican Mocha latte. Not bad. I'm use to a heavier coffee flavor so I thought they were both very mild.

When we visit a new restaurant as a family (that is meant for kids to visit), I am critical on how my children are treated. The staff did not disappoint. They were busy but were working hard on getting orders out. The latte was yummy and my girls loved the pastries. At one point one off girls spilled her drink on accident and the staff was so kind. They helped clean it up and brought her a new drink. That act right there won me over and we will be back. The young man who helped clean up chatted away with us as he mopped it up and reassured my daughter that it happens often and not to worry. I am also a huge fan of the vegan options. The drinks can be made with almond or rice milk. Hurray! We use both often at home instead of cow milk. My younger daughter was super happy to be able to order a chocolate milk with rice milk. We don't find that too often around here. I look forward to making more trips to Sunrise Coffee.",

At first I was like wow $5 fro a breakfast sandwich and the moment I took my first bite I was like oh sh*t, this egg sandwich is hella good.    The croissant was soft enough that it just melts in your mouth,  Egg was scrambled just right.  It came with avocados and tomato and something that I have never had or seen before in a sandwich. It wasn't lettuce but instead leaves.  Yes, like leaves on trees.  Anyone that has been here before know what these green leaves are?  Reason I'm asking is I'm going to attempt to see if i can make a sandwich similar to this at home.  And oh, they serve coffee as well, haha.  Free WiFi too along with good music in the background because any place that plays nightmare on wax is a def' thumbs up in my book. They do spoken words (open mic poetry session) I believe every monday night from what I know of before, but I don't know if it still goes on as of now.  Aight ya'll, back to studying.",

    "text": "This quaint little coffee shop offers everything that Las Vegas lacked for so long. Overran by Starbucks, there was a minute chance that an independent place could thrive. Unlike the other stores that have come and gone, Sunrise has everything it takes to withstand the pressure from the big corporations. The coffee is fair trade, the tea is loose leaf, the food is better than most restaurants, everything can be vegetarian or veganized, the atmosphere is relaxed, the staff are helpful, and they have live bands that play on occasions. With all of these ups, I cannot think of a negative comment.   Upon checking in for checking in for the first time, you get an offer for a free iced coffee. I decided to save it for another day as an incentive and reminder to come back. I had ordered the Alien Burrito even though I abhor most of the ingredients with a passion. I know very few people who hate cream cheese, refried  beans, ranch, or mayo as much as I do and a combination of these items would usually have me gagging. When I had ordered, I asked for no cream cheese and ranch. The person taking my order asked if I would like to get the vegan version, subbing a vegan cream cheese and mayo instead. While hesitating and cringing, she assured me that it was a better alternative and fewer calories. Not wanting to be one of those people who refuses to give certain foods another try, I trusted her, and caved. Before she started making it, she gave me the option of having Sriracha sauce. If you love Vietnamese food, the spicy red sauce makes pho even better than it already is. As advertised, it makes everything better. I won't go overboard and say I will be layering all of my foods in mayo or cream cheese, but I won't be averse to getting this burrito again.",

It's a great place to meet someone for a 1st date or to study or hang out. It can get busy, though, so a seat isn't always a guarantee.",

I did not realize that the whole menu was vegetarian/vegan, but the chili burrito totally exceeded my expectations. I had a white chocolate mocha and a hot chocolate (I was there awhile). Both were very good.   I give this location 4 stars because while it totally satisfied my desires for a unique coffee shop that reminded me of the northwest, the artwork was a bit risque. It was good, but I would not take children there. Otherwise, it was a fabulous atmosphere.",

Sure, there are a lot of Starbucks, but I mean a place that has coffee that doesn't taste like water.  This lack of coffee houses is especially True near where I live in east Vegas.  There are a couple, but none that really have the feel I want.    But alas!  I have found a place.  The coffee was very good, the cappuccinos are great, they offer the option of a french press, and even their iced coffee was great!  The coffee was from Klatch Coffee, a small family roaster in Southern California, and you could tell they took the extra effort to find a great roaster.    I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but after endless terrible cappuccinos I thought that maybe I'd never find a great cappuccino in Las Vegas.  But when I got my first sip of the cappuccino at Sunrise Coffee, it was more than just a sip, it was a renewed faith in Las Vegas coffee.  The coffee was flavorful, yet smooth, and when combined with perfect froth it created a great cappuccino.    I will be coming back often!",

When I first ordered this, I wasn't sure what to expect - I thought I would be just getting fried eggs on a croissant, which is fine, I love eggs. Their croissant wich has egg, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and a bit of mayo. So good!  I love their lemon poppy seed muffin, and having tried their banana nut muffin, just as yummy. The top of the muffin has that crispy right from the oven texture. A total perk is that my pup gets a doggy treat sometimes! Love that they are vegetarian and vegan friendly and are also animal lovers!",

PHENOMENAL! Something about the crunchiness of the spinach with the creaminess of the hummus makes it all go together. I've had their caramel frappe twice and their Dark Caramel (caramel hot choc) once and both times they were on point. They are comparable to Starbucks in pricing but I don't care for Starbucks. I'd rather a local organic coffeehouse any day. They will make your drink sugar free and with any milk you desire, just ask.

The food is far superior to the coffee. Specifically, the alien burrito is really amazing!! Also, their cups are compostable! That's an added bonus, but I'm so bummed on my coffee.",

I love that they have big, tasty, VEGAN entrees (vegan only upon request) that are reasonably priced. The free, crisp cold water is also a big plus. And the patio is nice. What I don't love is their cold beverage selection, because it's so EXPENSIVE yet has such little content that permits such a cost. In other words, their blended drinks are a total ripoff. I go here solely for the vegan burrito. However, last time I came here, it made me feel sick and nauseous. Not sure what caused that.",

I was so excited to take my mom and sister to a \"cool\" coffee shop that offered gluten free, vegan options as well as almond milk coffee. We actually got lost and it took longer than expected to get to this joint so the anticipation was rising as we finally find the place.  When we head in, the place is already filled with hipsters reading or on their laptop. I'm thinking, \"Cool.  This HAS to be a great spot.\" I order the nom nom burrito and the almond milk green tea latte. They tell us that the burrito will be a 15 minute wait.  So we have a seat and we notice that the place is quite dirty - empty plates, napkins, and wrappers are on the floor and on tables.  We finally get our drinks and the flavor was good. I'm not sure if I would drive out of the way to get their coffee.  We finally get the burrito and once I bit into it, I was not happy - it was bland, cold, and unfulfilling.  I actually couldn't eat the whole thing - of which, I felt so bad to leave a half eaten burrito on my plate.  My sister and mom felt the same way and I felt even worse that I am the reason why we went to this spot in the first place.  I'm sorry, Yelpers - Not a 4.5 star review for me.",

While Sunrise doesn't roast their own beans, they do get it from a source I have never heard of before. Klatch Coffee, I believe. That was certainly not the reason for our visit to Sunrise. Nope, the Vegan pastry options lured us in.   We arrived rather late in the day, so it's understandable that many of their items were sold out. We got a muffin, which we ate the next day. It was pretty darn scrumptious. Moist, soft and just sweet enough. If it's that good \"day old\", I'm sure it is even better when eaten the same day.  We got a latte from the hipster baristas. They were all smiles, which should be the norm, yet sadly isn't always. They did put it in a paper cup even though we wanted to drink it inside. No big deal, yet I always prefer my drinks in ceramic if I'm not traveling with it.   Despite several Yelp photos, latte art isn't their specialty, yet the latte came out smooth and balanced. The best coffee I had in Vegas, although that isn't saying much.  Maybe with all the desert heat, Vegas doesn't necessarily specialize in brewing coffee, yet here is Sunrise churning out java that's nearly as good as you'll find in the best coffee brewing locales, such as San Francisco Bay Area. With several sweet and savory Vegan options, excellent coffee, and a unique atmosphere, Sunrise was completely worth the short drive from The Strip to check it out.",

It has everything I love in a coffee shop, excellent coffee, yummy food, good music, and interesting people to watch. I ordered a sugar free caramel vanilla latte and a   croissant sandwich. I was super jazzed that they have several sugar free options. My coffee came out with a beautiful design in the foam. It was so pretty and tasted just as good as it looked. Next my sandwich came out. The croissant was flakey and buttery. It was filled with egg, avocado, tomato, lettuce and Veggie mayo. They even spelled out smile with a design of a kitty on my plate in veggie mayo. I enjoyed the sandwich and would totally try all the other items on the menu.   If you find worn chairs and tables endearing like I do you won't be put off by the comfy chairs. They have places for you to plug in your lap top or just to charge your phone. I noticed they also have outdoor seating. All the baristas were friendly and chatty. Plus, they have some seriously cool art on display.  I've been craving their coffee ever since and I can't wait to go back for more. Yay!!",

I kind of feel like Las Vegas doesn't have a lot of independent coffee shops, and was really happy a friend brought me here one evening.  We got Mexican mochas with coffee.  Nice rich chocolate flavor with cinnamon.  There are always pretty designs in the foam.  There are also pastries behind the glass case but I haven't tried them yet.  I really like the outside seating when the weather is nice and a little overcast.  Overall the establishment is pretty chill.",

    "text": "Amazing customer service!!! The food was great as well. They have a lot of vegan options and tons of amazing lattes to choose from. For non-dairy options they have almond, rice, soy and coconut creamer. The barista was very helpful, I let him choose my non dairy option to best compliment my creme brulee latte. 5 stars for the creme brulee latte, he also made a very cute art work on it. My sister had the orange mocha latte with rice milk and OMG it's was delicious 10stars!! For food I had the tofurkey sandwich 4/5 stars, there's some ingredients that I could have gone with out. My sister had the nom nom burrito \"the eggs didn't taste like real eggs, the beans tasted like caned refried beans and it was cold, I was hoping it would be hot because there was eggs and potatoes in it. 2/5 stars.\" Finally, we decided to share the hummus and pita chips 2/5 stars. The presentation was not there, the hummus was in a little to go container and the pita chips where in the bag. Very cute spot, very hipster. Although the food needs a little work the drinks where out of this world. Now Customer service is everything to me and this place definitely has it going on!! All of the employees were so kind and helpful and for that reason they deserve 5 stars!",

    "text": "If there was a way to give this place negative stars, I would. Ridiculously, lousy customer service, over priced and doesn't care for the customer one bit. Let me tell you about my first and last visit.   First visit, I came through the drive thru. I ordered drinks and 2 breakfast sandwiches. I was told the sandwiches would take 10 mins. I was willing to wait since it was first time trying the place. I pulled the car up in front of the store to wait. After 20 minutes no sandwiches and iced drinks melting. I make my way to the door and the employee walks out and says I couldn't find you. I was 1 of 4 cars in the parking lot! How the hell couldn't she find me!? My coffee sucked by the time I got home and sandwiches were ok.   Wanting to give them a second chance to redeem themselves, I decided to give them a chance this morning.  Now for today...in the drive thru again. I order the same thing. This time, my sandwich quote time is 15 minutes. I ask for the coffee to be made after the sandwiches so they wouldn't melt. Guess what the drive thru girl said?! \"NO, I am running a cue here.\" I respond with, \"So you would rather me wait with my drinks melting as opposed to giving me my whole order fresh?\" She responds, \"That is how we do it, I have to.\" I think it's needless to say I drove through the drive thru without making a purchase.   So moral of the story...NEVER VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THIS POOR OF SERVICE AND LACK OF CARE FOR A CUSTOMER'S REQUEST. ANY PLACE THAT WOULD RATHER GIVE UP YOUR BUSINESS THAN ACCOMMODATE YOUR SIMPLE REQUESTS DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!   NEGATIVE 50 STARS!",

Not only do they have awesome coffee roasted in house but the atmosphere and baristas are amazing:)   They have a variety of coffees and many delicious coffee creation.  My first love has always been the Mexican mocha and Nutella !  If your not in the mood for a sweet drink the French press and standard drip are great!  If Mike is there he will give you the run down on what he has been roasting.  Not to mention he is a genuinely nice guy who cares about what he is doing and the coffee he is roasting.   But for me what pushes Sunrise to a perfect 5 are the barista!  If you are a morning person you will get to interact with Amanda and Becky.   Two ladies who are always willing to shoot you a smile, talk with you about your day and suggest some great drinks (Amanda introduced me to the green tea latte).   If you are there at night (like me) you get to hang with Mae, Jet and Michelle!  Whether you are; exchanging witty banter with Jet while chatting about life, putting your faith in Mae with her many creations accompanied by talks about the adventures of the day or having Michelle convince you to try a matcha shot with a chaser or good conversation, you will always feel welcomed when coming in the door.    You can get a good cup of coffee many places but if you want a great cup of coffee served with a side of awesome baristas then sunrise is the place for you :)",

The real reason I keep coming back however is the coffee. I'm an unapologetic snob from an unapologetically snobby city -- yep, New York -- and I was appalled at the coffee scene when I first moved here (sorry, The Beat). But Sunrise changed that. Not only do they actually know what a pour-over coffee is, they make a damn good one. The Mexican is my fave. The house brew, iced, and other varieties are also fantastic.",

I had no idea it was right around the corner for me. 4 weeks into going Vegan and I was starting to feel like my only option at any restaurant or cafe was lettuce topped with veggies. Not so at Sunrise Coffee! I'm finding lots of other places offer items as well, but menus need to be asked for. The coffee was delicious, and just as beautiful to boot! The food was great. I had the Alien Burrito, and my boyfriend had the nomnom burrito. Both made vegan. No complaints from either of us! Prices are fair. The staff is adorable and friendly!  Support local, and keep this place alive!!",

I've never had anything to eat other than a cookie and a muffin, but I want to try the more savory fares.

And with the lack of cold and wet comes a lack of inviting public (indoor) spaces to sit and talk, sit and read, or sit and work--otherwise known as the local coffee shop.  Which is the part of the reason that I am such a huge cheerleader for Sunrise Coffee and tell everyone that they should drive to Sunrise no matter what side of town they live on.    Sunrise is one of the only independent coffee shops in Vegas.  And they've done a great job making a caffeinated space to inspire creativity, wakefulness, conversation, and community.  It's a space that's rare in Vegas.  But it's also an inviting space with the options of comfy chairs, tables, outlets to plug in a laptop, and at least one larger table for a group meeting.  Beyond the space, Sunrise offers great coffee (organic, fair trade, and well-roasted), delicious steamed milk coffee drinks (one of the few places in town offering a cafe au lait and Mexican hot chocolate).  And if you want a healthier breakfast option or vegan food options, they've got you covered.    Bottom line: I'm in love with Sunrise.  It's proof that we can have the sun and outdoors of the desert and not give up the cozy nooks and tasty warm drinks of the colder cities.",

I have done the drive though and counter service many times. Unfortunately both are extremely slow. I was very upset this morning after waiting in the drive through for 3 minutes just to order my coffee. Then when I got to the window and handed him my debit card he handed me my coffee and went to charge me. After waiting 5 minutes I heard him say to the other woman \"Why is she still here?\" He walked over to the window and asked what I wanted to which I exclaimed \"My debit card!\" He said, \"Oops oh yeah hold on.\" He went to the register and couldn't find it walks back to the window where he had it sitting on the ledge. He hands it to me with NO apology. I am truly disgusted by the lack of customer service or accountability with my money! The only reason I even go back is because its the only coffee spot on my way to work. But trust me I don't enjoy having to deal with any of the people that work there or the WAIT. The only saving grace is a young woman named May. She has always been delightful, I wish her co-workers would take some tips from her. A simple apology for my time wasted and him misplacing my debit card might of gotten them a higher scoring. I really don't recommend this place they are too inconsistent with their products and the customer service is greatly lacking.",

I think I must have tried everything on their menu and my favorites are definitely the alien burrito with a regular vegan cappuccino. The coffee itself is delicious and it isnt watered down or bitter. I find the quality to be way better then what you would get at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks and as soon you take a sip you'll be able to tell the difference. The staff is usually really friendly although I have ran into some attitude in the past over pettiness like asking if they had almond miik, or someone forgetting that my order was not to go which was not very pleasant but the new staff is just lovely and tend to go out of their way to make sure you are being treated well. I also love that Sunrise has so many vegan options, this is why this place keeps me going back, I love sitting outside on their patio on a nice cool day or chillin inside during the summer sippin on their delicious teas. I love this place I am giving it 5 stars",

Sunrise is SUCH a sweet local place for getting work done, enjoying good coffee & coincidentally, going on dates! Long story shortened: my sister and her fiance met at Sunrise Coffee. Since it's such a special place for them, when he was ready to propose, he enlisted myself and other sister to help with the details of the night. We asked the staff if we could rent out the patio and they would not accept any money, but were so excited and helpful that they strung bulb lights just for the occasion. They also let us come early and decorate the patio with rose petals and candles, as we packed it full of 40 people. They stayed open an hour later than normal and even made a special playlist of love songs for the night. My sister was completely caught off guard and we celebrated the engagement with the happy, friendly staff of Sunrise, drinking hot cocoas and eating their delicious baked goods & chocolate.   I could not be more impressed and thankful for this adorable, neighborhood cafe and it's sweet staff.   P.S. They sell their yummy Mothership coffee (it's fair trade and absolutely AMAZING)!! Happy coffee dates :]",

The coffee is extraordinary and priced reasonable (read: as much as I'm willing to pay for coffee- which is not much!) it was earthy and flavorful.  The Mint Mocha Frappe was a delightful combination of two delicious flavors. You can taste the dark flavors of the mocha with the freshness of the mint - without either overpowering the other.   I ordered a vegan nom nom burrito, a breakfast burrito, vegan style. It was delicious. It had flavors and texture so often missing from vegan food and was truly one of the best I've ever had. It was a refreshing change and paired nicely with the black tea latte I also ordered.   The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely wanted to make sure we enjoyed our food and our stay. I'll definitely be returning to Sunrise Coffee as I continue to visit Vegas.",

When I entered the store it was clean and every looked and smelled amazing. I talked to a staff member and discussed how I thought they would have something with egg as a meal item. I was informed by associate that a couple blocks down was the roaster and they were open with a great deal of items.  I jumped in my car and drove the 5-7 minutes down the block. As I was looking for the store I was having an issue finding it. I called talked to an employee who told me where it was. I told them great I would be there in seconds. They responded great!  Moments later I arrived. The store was locked up and closed. I was shocked considering two employees never mentioned they open in over an Hour from the time we talked. As I walked back to my car I saw what I thought was a customer pull up. I mentioned that they where closed thinking they also where given mis information. The individual states he was the manager. I informed Him what happened and he seemed as if he did not care. I jumped in my car drove back to the first location. I ran into the same employee and again no apologies just a shrug.   The food and coffee where amazing however the customer service was terrible. It took what should have been 5 minutes more like 30-40. I felt it was important to give you a heads up since you make incredible coffee and bake goods I would hate to have poor customer service ruin your name / business.  If you have questions please feel free to contact me.",

I usually go to mothership because it's around the corner and much quieter then sunrise but I was craving some flavor. As soon as I got to the counter the cashier wasn't there and walks up to the counter with food in his mouth not really showing any customer care towards me no enthusiasm. I get it but what really pushed my to the edge is that it took me almost 40 Minutes to get my 2 Lattes very simple to make one was iced one was a mocha I asked politely if I could get them soon that was after a 20 minute wait another 20 standing there. I get it you guys were clearly busy but get a SYSTEM down please your coffee is awesome but the service not so much",

Today was a fluke; it was 1:30 p.m., on my way to a 2p appointment just a block away from Sunrise (3min away).  I figured I can sneak in a quick cold brew and a PB&J. Well that was a mistake. I placed my order at 1:33 and at 1:53 I was starting to get concerned that someone dropped the ball because a PB&J probably takes all of 5min even if it were your first day on the job and, they weren't even busy.    Finally someone on staff noticed and was aware enough to see that a customer was clearly at angst about sonething. They made it and brought it out in under 2min. See, it can be done.  In the end, I had all of 2 minutes to scarf down that sandwich. They were sincerely apologetic and acknowledged that it was not communicated to the kitchen.  I'll accept that albeit does not change the domino effect it caused the rest of my day.  My world runs on 30-minute increments; all it takes is one to screw up the flow. Go to Sunrise when you're relaxed, have your computer to do work or just hang out but, if you're  a go-getter where you need the people in your day to have a sense of urgency, you'd be better off elsewhere.",

For atmosphere, I give it a 5 star, but it's a 3 star due to the disappointing coffee and that's what I came here for. The pastries were decent but it's not something I would come back for.   Hot pumpkin spiced latte: the presentation was beautiful since I got it in a mug, but the drink didn't have nearly enough flavor in it for my liking. It just tasted like a normal latte.  Nutella frappuccino: no hint of Nutella in it whatsoever and the taste was like a watered down \"I want to be bitter, but not quite there yet\".  Maybe I didn't try what they were known for but after those two drinks that lacked so much flavor, I probably won't be coming back.",

    "text": "I still think you guys seriously need a second restroom. Theres enough space from the outside seating area where you can expand enough to make a second one. If you just take up small inches from the seats closest to the windows/doors you could make a second restroom by splitting the current one into two. It would be enough space to use it and walk out. If you take the same amount of space that you have from the corners of the building by the entrance you can have that space for a second restroom.  It's just very inconvenient, still, to have people waiting to use it, even though the lock says \"in use\". It was a good idea to put it that way, however it does not solve the bigger issue. All that renovating you make in the year, could have been spent on a second restroom. Iv'e notice that you do these small projects two or three times a year in the coffee shop. You get the same amount of people in regardless if you switch it up. Why not add something that will bring more people in? I mean a restroom is not a \"highlight\" of the place, but it can ease tension of some people having to use the restroom.  Heres the thing about why it would be in your benefit to do it. First, you can reduce the waiting time for people waiting by the restroom and make those sitting at the seats less uncomfortable with people behind them and they having to squeeze forward to make room for people waiting behind. Second, it would make people want to sit there because the line with a second restroom would diminish. Third, you would ease the tension customers feel when having to go to the restroom. In my experience, I get rather lazy to go to the coffee shop because I may not find a seat depending on the hour, but even worse that is I do, I know that I wont be able to use the restroom as quickly as I can, or get there and then have someone outside losing their mind because they can't hold it. Fourth, you have children that reeaalllyy cant hold it and if theres someone in there or just went in, then it can really cause a mess. Last, for your staff, iv'e noticed that your staff gets a little stressful when having to clean. They clean once, and then they find themselves having to return because some people make a mess in there.",

    "text": "They have a lot of decent stuff, the workers are friendly. It's always busy here. But there are some things on the menu I think they should fix. The main thing is anything with chai. I don't think the owner knows what Chai really is? It is not just adding nutmeg to tea and giving it a stir. What I get is little pieces of spice in my mouth, and not the taste of chai. just nutmeg. They should prep a chai tea like other places do. If the owner reads this, my advice is go try Bad Owls chai tea. Theirs are prepped and stored in advance, and they add the concentrated chai to the drinks that require chai. The other piece of advice would be their Matcha ice lattes. I believe the matcha is added to a cold drink. Matcha needs to be added to a small amount of hot water, and whisked. Then ice and milk is added. Doing this will give it more flavor and no more clumps of matcha tea floating around.",

I walked up to the counter and ordered a pour over coffee along with a Nom Nom Burrito. Coffee was delicious. I'm pretty simple, I prefer black coffee. The burrito was good, I didn't really fancy the cream cheese in the burrito, it was kinda odd so I'll do without it next time. The only thing I can think of that I didn't like or wasn't convenient were the extremely teeny tiny mini tables for solo eaters. There was only room for a plate and drink or just my laptop. I had to set my laptop aside while I ate. But other than that, I would come back again.",

I also ordered one of their bagels called the Do Gooder; an everything bagel with herb cream cheese, avocado, tomato, and salt and pepper.  It sounds simple but it was absolutely delicious. We went on a Sunday around noon so it was a little busy but they were handling it very well.  They even had a sign up that said all food orders would take about 15 minutes.  Though that sounds reasonable, my bagel took between 5 and 10 while my friend's granola took closer to 15.   It was full but we had no trouble finding a table outside in the sun.  Staff was friendly and they have a great atmosphere as well.  There is a dog park right across the street so many people had their dogs outside with them.  We were thrilled but if you aren't a dog fan, be aware.",

I don't live that close to it so I tend to go out of my way to visit instead of going to my local Starbucks/Coffee Bean/etc (barf), and it's always well worth the trip. It's probably a mixture of the drinks, atmosphere, and people that keep me coming back.   The menu is filled with a variety of drink choices, flavors, and mixes along with an array of milk alternatives and options for hot/cold, caffeinated/decaf, and seasonal choices that I don't usually see around town. I don't like my drinks too sweet so I don't get too crazy, and I'm usually happy with a simple latte or coffee here, but I love having options. The price of drinks are very fair, especially with how much other places around town are charging (looking at you, S@mb@). I haven't tried many of their food choices but my favorite has to be the vegan Alien Burrito. Most of their items are cafe-type items good with coffee like pastries or breakfast foods.  Sunrise is also well known for their totes adorbs outdoor seating that gets very popular when weather is pleasant. They really optimized their indoor seating with the space they have, yeah you might have to put your sweet butt in peoples face to pass by when it's busy but overall it works and there is a range of table sizes available so you can read a book, chat with friends, work on your Harry Potter erotic fan fiction, meet up with your Tinder date (I somehow always manage to sit right next to these), or for your next pyramid scheme business meeting.    For me, Sunrise has some of the best baristas I've come across, they almost always play amazing music, they keep the place super clean, and they always make sure I'm happy with my drinks. Even the regulars I come across seem friendly & polite.. there's beard guy who I think I see at my gym, older guy with the laptop who sneezes once every hour, girl who sits in the corner planning mischievous things, super knowledgeable dude who stands up at the front, buff bag guy who brings his smelly food to eat with him almost every time, the young group of people with accents that I'm sure are mostly runway models, and Erik with a k who always orders when I do to make sure we get confused on whose order is ready. I know I missed a few others, please say hello if you want part of my honorable mentions or if you want out!",

The staff is amazing, the food is amazing (Alien Burrito is my favorite), and the coffee and drinks are the best in Las Vegas. I especially love their cold brew and their orange mocha. I'm no longer in Vegas but whenever I visit I try to stop by.",

Ok maybe reading and people watching is more like what I mean.  I enjoy everything about this place from food, drinks, atmosphere to the perfect level on the tunes that are usually making sweet sounds. I also really admire that the owner has designed every aspect of this place and they've used their own hands, labor and creativity to bring beautiful uniqueness to their establishment.    Stop in and support a damn fine LOCAL establishment.",

It's filled with scrambled egg, a nice amount of spinach, cheese, tomato, and avocado (for no additional charge).  At many places, croissants often seem pre-packaged, flat, and have just been sitting inside the window the entire day. The croissant here seems fuller, buttery, slightly flaky.. (don't mean to exaggerate) but it's comparable to the ones I've had in Paris as well. The fact they freshly bake everything here makes the biggest difference compared to other coffee houses that opt to outsource their food items.   The service and atmosphere also do not disappoint whether you're looking for a nice study spot or a place to meet clients over some coffee.",

However their outside sitting area is really beautiful, it's for the most part shady and has a wall of intertwining vines/plants. This is where I chose to sit.   I ordered a \"mint iced mocha with a blueberry muffin,\" and the girl rung me up but she didn't give me my muffin even though I clearly asked for one. It may have been my fault, but oh well it was too busy to correct her after our transaction so I let it slide. They were kind to deliver our drinks outside where we were sitting and the presentation was appetizing. I have to say that I didn't enjoy the coffee all that much. It was too minty than anything so I didn't end up finishing it. I'm probably not going to go back since the experience wasn't as good as ones I have had at other coffee shops near by.",

Whenever I'm in the city it's a ritual to visit this place...it's not just because I love coffee but it's more about how they roast and brew their coffees. Their exquisite handmade lattes with freshly brewed roasted coffee beans are rich and taste apart from other cafes.  Without saying much about this place once should go and try it to understand the True taste of roasted brewed coffee.",

I got a regular latte and bagel with cream cheese. It was nice that the bagel and cream cheese were both vegan, suiting my dietary needs. However, my latte was maybe lukewarm at best and my bagel came out slightly burnt.   I honestly felt like they were just trying to get food and drinks out as fast as they could without any attention to quality. At Mothership, I felt that they poured all their love into crafting my beverage.   The wifi is also incredibly spotty. I wasn't even trying to load intense videos. It would just take minutes to load a page.   In short, go to Mothership where the wifi and coffee is better.",

They have a cute outdoors patio that is cute for pictures. As well as inside is also super cute, and a perfect place to just come sit and do Any work.

What makes them different is the quality of their coffee beans and flavor options. For lattes, my favorite syrups are the creme brulee, orange mocha, and truffle berry with either rice milk or almond milk. For herbal teas, I like the south pacific iced because it's fruity and perfect for the summer!   FOOD: Vegan and gluten free options are available! Sunrise Coffee serves fresh pastries every morning (muffins, scones, croissant, and cookies). Their muffins are huge and my favorites are the banana nut muffin and strawberry lemon muffin. Lastly, they have a great breakfast/lunch menu --I recommend the alien burrito because of the tomato basil tortilla and unique mixture of couscous, hummus, and various vegetables.   OVERALL: Aesthetically pleasing decor with both indoor and outdoor seating. It's generally 2/3 packed (with people) inside, but there is never a line when I go in so that's a plus.",

I don't like writing negative reviews BUT this was literally the WORST coffee and espresso I have ever had.  Gas station coffee and hotel coffee is better (for real!!) The espresso was beyond bitter (yea - I know it generally has some to it - I order these all the time).  I struggled to even finish it.  Now for the coffee - I took like 3 sips and just finished pouring the rest out.  What a waste.  Horrible, bitter, weak - undrinkable. Which is hard to come by for me as I can tolerate an average or sub-par coffee when I am needing a pick-me-up. Won't be returning here for coffee ever again.  On a positive note, I watched some food pass by that did look really good and I overheard some positive comments so it might be worth coming back to try the food but I would suggest staying away from the coffee. Maybe the specialty drinks are better...",

The aesthetics of the whole place just makes you want to take trendy pictures for your Instagram  \\_()_/  (I am a victim of this, and I regret nothing.)  The coffee/espresso drinks: so far in my past visits, I've had their drip coffee, orange mocha latte over ice and a creme brulee latte. All the drinks i've tried are superb! Especially the orang mocha latte. If you are familiar with the orange flavored chocolate slices they have during Christmas time, the one wrapped in a blue foil, this latte taste EXACTLY the same---DELICIOUS. What's pretty cool too, is that they have a hemp milk substitute~~~   The food: two words---- Alien. Burrito. BEST VEGAN WRAP EVER. I always add mine with tofurkey, and spice it up with sirracha. It has couscous, hummus, bell peppers and spinach. Good food that is GOOD for YOU.   Definitely a local staple, if you're a coffee junky!  If you are ever in a need to be in an aesthetically pleasing environment to write your screenplay, Sunrise is the place for you.",

We made our way inside and it had the typical coffee house feel.  A little worn down, (tile was becoming discolored, plate that our food was served on was chipped) but all in all it was clean.  The seating inside is a little to cramped for my taste. Outside had more room, but if was very cold on this days adventure so we sat inside at the high bar.  The menu overhead does not list the wraps / food they offer,  just the drinks.  That menu is in paper form found by the register.  We went with two vanilla latte's, the Alien and Nom Nom wraps.  The coffee was very good and exactly what I was looking for.  The wraps were both average, and nothing out of this world.   All in all this is an above average coffee shop. Some minor tweaks, IE updating the interior and plate wear, while spacing out the seating would definitely up the rating.  Although I could not see my self dinning in again, I will defiantly swing through the drive through for a nice cup of java. Three and half stars would be my rating, but I will round up to four as a result of the nice cup of java and friendly staff.",

They are annoyed if you take too long to order and when you ask what is good, it's always a generic answer such as \"oh yeah I like that one.\" Or \"yeah it's okay.\" They sell coffee but have no knowledge about coffee, and every time I order a tea SWEET, they NEVER EVER EVER give it to me sweet.

Sunrise Coffee also serves up a lot of delicious food and pastries. My favorite is the ALIEN burrito. It is out of this world! Our kids love the PB&J sandwiches. I'm also a sucker for the pumpkin muffin.   The cafe itself has a very cozy interior and friendly staff. There is also a nice outdoor seating area.

The space is a little tight inside as many folks come with laptops or to read. There are couches, comfy chairs, low and high tables. They do have outdoor seating, which works now that the weather agrees. They also have a reading selection.  All in all, a great place for breakfast or lunch for the coffee aficionado or health nut. Seating can get cramped during peak times, but otherwise is comfy. Food quality is high and great vegan options. Great place for a quick grab or relax.",

Being a college student that just came back from Cali for Winter Break it's a little pricey, but once in a while it's a great treat.   The environment is relaxing. The music was unique and a bookshelf with a variety of random books, ranging from textbooks (I think) to video game strategy-guide books. It's really very quiet besides the occasional customer that comes in to talk. The owners/baristas are very friendly and knowledgeable. He remembered I came in a couple days earlier and I had lost my card that day, so he gave me two stamps.   I got a soy-chai latte with a shot of espresso (Dirty Chai). It was spicy and flavorful. At first thought they might have added too much...but after the initial taste, it was amazing. I took my vegan friends and one got some kind of burrito, they called it the alien burrito, that looked delicious.   Coffee kin rejoice. A quaint, stylish coffee shop that in the future I would love to bring friends to. Good job and thanks for the extra stamp!",

The place has free wi fi and has a cool vibe during weekends. I often go on sundays just to unwind while reading a good magazine/book.  edit: after more than 4 years and lots of coffee, I still think Sunrise Coffee is the best coffee shop in all of east LV. I also buy whole bean bags from the in-house roaster \"The Mothership\". The expresso blend is quite good and a great option for getting the freshest roasted coffee in the city (besides Colorado River Coffee Roasters, located in Boulder City, which takes 2-3 days to deliver by mail).",

The service is friendly, I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. They even have a little \"community\" bulletin  board.

I ordered a Nutella latte and my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino. The cashier was extremely friendly and helped us with our order since it was our first time. The Nutella latte was good - it wasn't overly sweet like other ones I've tried. The cappuccino wasn't so bad either.  My only negative review is that it closes at 8pm (6pm on Sundays). It's not much of a negative but I wish it stayed open longer!! It would be a great place to study. Other than that, it's a wonderful local business that everyone should visit!",

They have many vegetarian options on their menu (not so sure about vegan as I'm not a vegan).  Great value and a great place.  I will continue to make them my coffee stope as long as I am traveling to Vegas every week. The interior is fun and eclectic and the local artwork is a lot of fun to browse while waiting.

Bitter after taste isn't exactly our cup of tea.   My previous review, which I deleted for some odd reason, was pegged by the manager as narcissistic and I was labeled as a mean person hiding behind the internet. To that I will say that I understand the manager of a business wants to support her staff and that's fantastic. More power to you. I see that this business has 4.5 stars so it shouldn't be too difficult to accept that not everyone loves your product. I didnt have a good experience and I am certain that I am allowed to express my opinion because after all, Yelp is an application that is all about sharing. Don't get too upset about that and please read some of my reviews. When I like a business, I gush and give great reviews.

I like to venture out and experience what else is out there besides my usual Starbucks.  Arrived around 5:10pm on a Thursday evening. 5-8pm is happy hour. $1 small hot/iced coffee, $2 hot/iced latte, and $1 pastries.  UMM WHAT?! Seriously!? Happy hour coffee version!? Yes please. This is better than freakin alcoholic beverages for happy hour. Sorry....but I much rather choose iced coffees over alcohol ANY DAY. ANY FREAKIN DAY.  This place have a bunch of syrups to add to your coffee/beverage. They got your usual vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, sugar free. And then you got your orange, coconut, almond, marshmallow, peppermint, raspberry, strawberry...etc. It's an extra 45 cents to add flavoring. I probably sound like such a newbie for getting all excited over the wide varieties of syrups they have. Are all private coffee joints like this?? Sorry...I was so used to just Starbucks before moving here to Vegas lol.  So I got a small iced coconut latte with nonfat milk. Total cost: $2.45. Can't freakin beat that. $2 for an iced coffee at a coffee joint?!?!? That's heaven for me. My boyfriend got a 16oz iced mocha frap. That cost $4 with some change. Too bad this place is pretty far from where I live otherwise I'd be here wayyyyyyy moreeee often. Like everyday.",

They have a fun menu with things like an orange mocha and lavender matcha tea latte. Today I ordered a hazelnut latte with soy milk. Yum! The only qualm I have with sunrise is that their drinks are heavily flavored. I don't like my coffee to be too sweet but every time I've gotten something here it's a bit thick on the flavoring.

The coffee is very good quality and they have a lot of tea options as well. Another plus is all the vegan food options that they have. If you're in a hurry, I would not recommend ordering food in the drive thru because they do make it to order and there is a bit of a wait. Sunrise does not like to keep guests waiting, i have even received a few free coffees for waiting. Their customer service is very friendly as well. Overall I definitely recommend you give it a try.",

    "text": "Sunrise Coffee is a golden ray of blissful warmth to get you moving in the right direction!  Sunrise is a local coffee house that excels at customer service while offering a nice selection of quality options.  They are probably best known for their Mothership Roasters Coffee, but they also have several good loose leaf teas that are sure to please. I also look forward to enjoying one of their tasty wraps. The Alien (Left a Burrito in the Midwest) is my go-to option.  It's a vegetarian option that leaves me satisfied and never missing meat. The Alien consists of a tortilla wrap with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, and red bell pepper. If I'm not eating eating the Alien I am probably enjoying the similar Nomnom Breakfast Burrito featuring a tortilla, eggs, vegetarian beans, potatoes, cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, avocados, sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. Other items are also great, but I keep returning for the Alien.  Sunrise Coffee is located on Sunset in a typical Vegas strip mall that does nothing on its own to entice you to its businesses, but once you make it in the door, Sunrise offers a clean and comfortable environment to meet a friend or get some work done. Needless to say it is one of my favorite coffee shops around.",

    "text": "When a person leaves a review that is less than favorable for a business, the owners have two choices. 1.  They can lash out, and post awful things in response, which I've seen a number of businesses do. 2.  They can reach out privately to the customer, and sincerely apologize, (also stating that they will be having a meeting to correct the behavior...)  This is how I found myself back at Sunrise Coffee so soon after my visit a couple of weeks ago.  I was less than impressed then, but the day after I posted my review, I was contacted by the owner.   He apologized profusely and sincerely, and stated that there would be a meeting to address what I had referred to as \"snarky attitudes.\" That impressed me.  For an owner to reach out on a personal level, well...that scores big points with me.    Well.  Whether it was the meeting, or I just happened to be there on an off day last time, today's visit was night and day.   I walked in, and the vibe was better. The shop was packed, but employees were smiling...even the girl who was dealing with a rather difficult sounding customer was super sweet.  Service was polite.  Friendly...everything I had expected!  The coffee, again, was delicious.  Today I tried the Truffleberry, and wowza, is THAT delicious! I also tried a carrot cake muffin, which to me was a little dry, but had an all around good flavor.    Sunrise, you've 100% redeemed yourself.  I intend fully to visit again, and maybe even sit with a good book or my knitting some weekend.",

I was able to order a basic drip coffee simply without having to learn a new coffee language, which I appreciate. The only decision was whether it was going to be to go or to drink there and whether I wanted room left for adding cream. I wish I had had the time to stay. The shop is kind of hipster, artsy and has a really good vibe.  Bottom line: Great place to get a coffee if you are into simple without all the unnecessary language involved when you order at that other coffee shop and if you place value on excellent customer service.",

Plus it couldn't have tasted any better!   My daughter and her friends ordered hot cocoa that was a perfect temp for the little ones and we were able to sit outside and enjoy our Sunday morning in our beautiful Las Vegas weather.

The alien wrap is a meat free wrap that fills you up and just makes you feel good afterward! Definitely recommend this place and the mint mocha as well! Excellent staff, quaint space with a cute patio. Perfect for easy Sunday mornings or any morning for that matter!",

I have known about the shop for quite some time, knowing that they have an abundance of vegan coffee options as well as breakfast foods. However, I have never made it over to the shop because the menu online, while offering a number of vegan breakfast options, never really hooked me.  Well I finally went and... WOW! The staff was super friendly and helpful, offering up their ideas for what coffee I should get as my first. I went with a simple almond milk French vanilla iced latte and got my bf a regular iced caramel vanilla latte. Their fresh baked goods display hooked me, and I couldn't walk out without a chocolate coconut muffin (gluten free AND vegan!). They had an amazing array of vegan baked goods and their menu is even more extensive than shown online. I cannot wait to go back and enjoy another delicious iced latte such as the smores or Nutella flavor, and try a gluten free/vegan bagel. Mmm.",

And they employ lots of hipsters so I can't help but feel a little hipster myself when I spend a little time slinging some code on my Macbook Pro.  Just speaking to my experience, I always find about 1 out of every 4 employees that provide decent customer service.  This morning's visit did it in for me.  I ordered a blueberry muffin which looked great but tasted like cardboard.  Maybe I don't have a vegan palette or something but I'm a big eater and to find things I can't stomach are very few and far between.  Also, I had to wait 15 minutes for a bottled water.  A bottled water!  I'm a black iced coffee drinker, so this place serves just as good black iced coffee as any place.  In closing, place looks great, staffed with cool looking people, and with good wi-fi but lacking in good food and good service.",

Quite frankly, I don't care about the fair trade, all vegan stuff but I do like the expansive and varied collection of books they keep around.  The only real gripe I have is that they only have two people working during peak time handling both the inside service and the drive through so it takes a while to get your order taken and then to get your  order made.  Not a bad thing when you plan to hang out there, but it is annoying when you're on your way somewhere.  Edit: They've upped their staffing so long wait times are no longer an issue.",

I should have known not to judge a book by its cover! My girl and I decided to hit this place up after a crazy work out this weekend and were floored! The decor is the perfect little coffee shop -- the delish smell of freshly ground rounds hits you just as you walk in; display art from (I think) local artists decorates the walls; the furniture is slightly kitch but super comfortable; and, if you need it, there are both books to read and board games to play.  LOVE IT! I had the (60 CALORIES, people!!) Almond Frappe -- made with agave nector and almond milk -- YUM -- and the Middle East Burrito (check out Lisa L's review for the yummy fixins in this sucker!) - DELISH!! My girl had their chocolate frappe and one of their omlette 'wiches -- HEAVENLY (I sampled!)  And, the folks that work here totally rock!! They are v. knowledgable about the products they use and are too excited to tell you that they cater to every type of diet (Vegans/Veggies/Lactose Intolerant Folks -- you guys will love this place -- in addition to everything else, they've got soy milk; rice milk and almond milk.  They also have several veggie 'wich options including a tofurkey 'wich!) After Sunrise, I'm thinking I need to give the place with the Gorilla guy down the street a try!!",

Their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily.  They have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options (vegan friendly).  They have a good breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, beans, cheese, fresh avocado and lots of spinach.  There are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books, however they are only open till 8pm.  Awesome eclectic staff, super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees.  I wish they had a larger/better pastry selection and were open later.  We need a place in Vegas that is comparable to the living room in SD, and this is the closest I have found so far!  I so wish they'd open one in the Summerlin-ish area!!",

When I first starting going to Sunrise Coffee it wasn't nearly as busy as it is now.  I would sit there for three or four hours and see no more than 20 people come and go.  But I think with all these wonderful reviews they are accumulating a much larger fan base! This is the exact opposite of drive-thru coffee, so it takes more than 30 seconds to prepare a drink, but it is always worth the wait.  Some people stand right by the bar and stare at the barista while drumming their fingers waiting for their drink.  Which really irks me because it distracts from the laid-back environment where it is almost impossible to NOT sit down, relax, and stay awhile.  The employees are friendly, personable, and seems like they get along well with each other and enjoy their job.  It would be cool if they opened a new location, or could expand their current location because sometimes it gets a little cozy in there :)",
