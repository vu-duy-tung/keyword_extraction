The sangria was a perfect starter and everyone in the party loved their wines. The selection of appetizers and sides was stunning and creative, we had a vegetarian in the group, who was delighted the the choices. Please keep up the great work!!!!!",

I've been to many of the famous steakhouses across the US, including Charlie's in Orlando and Gibson's in Chicago.  The Ribeye Cap was spectacular!  So flavorful and bursting with melt in your mouth tenderness.  What a unique cut of meat.  Everyone at our table had something great.  We stared with Caesar salad and the Fried Spinach salads. Then had the Ribeye Cap, the traditional Ribeye and the Sea Bass.  We finished general with an incredible turtle sundae.  The whole experience was 5-star!  The ambiance was great the service was exceptional and the food was incredible.  The manager came to great us at our table and stopped by a few times which was impressive.  The wait staff constantly made sure we were taken care of.  At one point we had 5 wait staff  at our table taking care of a party of four.  We cants wait to be back!!  (Oh, and for those who like a little extra flair, don't miss a trip to the restrooms to use the salt scrub!)",

    "text": "Las Vegas is full of fabulous chefs. I conducted a breakfast interview with a famous chef at MGM Resorts who asked to meet me for breakfast at Cafe Leone in Tivoli Village. The time was early. As soon as Echo & Rig opened up across the street from Cafe Leone, the chef jumped up saying, \"Come with me.\" They took me inside Echo & Rig. They said, \"It is the best!\" The best chefs and bakers in Las Vegas enjoy eating at Echo & Rig. Yesterday the professionals on Dancing with the Stars opened their new dance studio named Dance with Me Summerlin across the street. All the people went to eat dinner at Echo & Rigs. The place was so packed that they had to put out tables and chairs for people to sit on as they waited. Each diner beamed with a smile. The place is gorgeous. The food delicious. Tivoli Village is masterful. Dining in Tivoli Village gives each bite the impression on the brain that you are dining in Europe. Combine the atmosphere with the taste at Echo & Rig and your experience is similar to traveling outside of Las Vegas for a weekend vacation in an exotic city separated from the gambling gaming town full of casinos.",

    "text": "To clarify the hours, the restaurant upstairs is open until 11. There is a bar downstairs with only a few late night  food specials that is open until 1am.  This place is carnivore heaven. With an in-house butcher shop supplying the restaurant, you can get pretty much any cut of meat you want.  I appreciate that Echo & Rig proudly displays what farm their meat comes from. This is huge, I wish all restaurants had this level of transparency.  Echo seems to source meat from smaller organic or all natural farms, something I am very happy to see and happy to pay a premium for.  On my first visit here I opted to share a massive 48oz porterhouse with my friend. When it came out pre-sliced I was worried, but all was good when I took a bite. It was properly rested before cutting, and so much easier to eat that way. I'm now a fan of this style.  The steak was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and good enough that it has brought me back to Echo & Rig many times.  This is now the place I crave after too many visits to Veggie House or when I need a little more (ok, a lot more) protein in my diet.   All the main dishes I have tried here have been excellent, I have not been disappointed with a single one. Notable highlights include the Lamb Porterhouse Chops, Summertime Steak Salad, Horseradish Crusted Butterfish, and of course all the steaks. You can't go wrong with any piece of meat here, but the Spencer Steak takes the crown - it's lean but very tender and always cooks to an even, perfect medium rare.  One minor complaint, the potato chips and stuffed mushroom that come with the steaks seem more like lunch items. These sides are not fit for dinner steaks and certainly don't add anything to the amazing steaks they are served with. I would prefer a choice of vegetable, roast or mashed potatoes, or even fries instead of the dry underwhelming chips.  Some of my favorite sides are the Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli, Grilled Octopus, Charcuterie Platter, Fried Spinach Salad (perfect to share, ask for it to be split in half), and roast potatoes.  The no corkage policy is awesome, I hope it is here to stay.",

We couldn't help but notice every other table received much more attentive service and the standard bone-in meat display choices to which we were not privy to. Could it be that 2 women out to dinner couldn't possible eat a large cut of beef? Or was there a passive discrimination towards 2 women who are a couple who dared to dine at this Snobberlin locale? We just couldn't figure it out. But on the merits of food alone, we would not return to Echo & Rig. Steak Tartare - Good and enjoyed caper berries. Tuna steak frites - Meh seared tuna swimming in a sea of sauce. Garlic mash was good. Jumping Beef - Beef tips in a stew-like sauce dubbed as Peruvian Demi-glass...it was ok but nothing to rave about. The only Echo we'll be dealing with is our Amazon Echo.",

Tivoli has had its fair share of unique eateries that have all had some sort of cool new age fusion or a gimmick thats tried to separate itself from the rest and failed. Echo & Rig has also gone down this path but has succeeded.  The layout is a bar and butchery with a outside seating area downstairs. Upstairs has your dining area.  There are plenty of reviews of echo & rig so I won't spend all day writing a review telling you the ins and outs but you must know this.  1) It's a steakhouse with a butchery, this means the cuts of meat are pretty decent.   2) The service is 9.5 out of 10  And   3) Its kinda of an upscale kinda place, dress nicely. It isn't a flip flops and singlet kinda of place.  Ok yelp said it was a $$, but it's a nice steakhouse, I'd probably say it's a $$$ And not the $$ given.",

Jackson probably could be a butcher himself with the extent of knowledge he possessed with the cuts and textures. Very friendly and always offered an opinion on the best choices to make.   I should also add the I drink a large amount of water. Most places have a hard time keeping up with my refills. Echo & Rig appeared to have a dedicated busser/drink runner that never disappointed.   Not kidding when I say the service and good was top notch.   For the food, we had a rib eye cap (8oz), portabella fries, bone marrow asada. All of which were exquisite.

    "text": "So, I have to say my expectations were pretty high following the hype about this place from my husband.    When we arrived, I felt like the restaurant was HEAVILY occupied my males. Which I get, being a steak house. I guess.   I thought the menu was a little odd in that the sides you order with your meat come out before the meat, as an appetizer. Maybe we were doing it wrong and nobody explained it differently to us.  Aside from not fully understanding that, the food was top notch. Seriously could not complain about any of the sides (we had the portobello fries, cauliflower, and sweet potato), and my filet, which I ordered well done, was cooked perfectly without them having to butterfly it.  Overall, I'd say this is a very masculine driver establishment. Great for a guys night, business meeting, or bachelor hang, but not so much a date night or place for the ladies. Atleast that was my experience.",

    "text": "Finally stopped had lunch at this place after many failed attempts to go. I really wanted to try their HH but everytime I would try it was a fail but I decided to just not worry about that and just come for lunch. And btw HH is everyday from 3-6pm. $1.99 steak and eggs I hear it's really tiny about 2 oz of steak but hey you can get 8oz steak for $8 if you think about it.   My favorites were the calamari and the fried cauliflower. Omg I never thought I would die over cauliflower but it is just so addicting. It has a great crunch with a nice little kick to it. So freaking good. The Calamari was cooked very well and not at all chewy and it had a great spice to it.   The MAC and cheese was also delicious. It wasn't too cheesy and they used the perfect macaroni size.    We also got the grass fed filet mignon. I loved how they explain how their meats are grass fed, no preservatives, no steroids, all natural meats! It was cooked to absolute perfection and was cut for us when it came out. It came out with a awesome sauce.   The staff are incredibly helpful and really know their menu. The bartender even hooked it up with a shot! Awesome fella.   I will be returning for that happy hour tho! I just can't wait.",

    "text": "Wow, rather unreal that at any given moment at dinner time you have at least 3 managers on the floor...probably necessary to please all the Yelpers... still that is always the case at Echo & Rig. Today we had Derek and Xavier visit us, along with their team featuring our server Nicholas and Master Oyster shucker Leone.  While we prefer Other Mama for oysters...having a great bottle of wine without corkage fee, it was a rational choice for us to dine at Echo & Rig tonight and as fortune would have it, it was one of the best among my dining experiences here. Good thing for no corkage fee, right?   Our table wasn't immediately ready, so we waited a little in front of the oyster raw bar area on the first floor where we got to talk to Leone...the French gentleman who knows everything about the Oysters that Echo & Rig have to offer. Kushi being sold out for the night, he kindly explained to us the rest of the evenings offerings...he was very fun and informative...say hello to him if you get the chance...after all, he is directly across from all those beautiful and friendly hostesses.  We ordered a dozen of oysters, Cauliflower, Arugula Salad, Hawaiian Tuna Poke and Maryland Lump Crab Cake.  Most of Items we regularly order since they are always on point for flavor. The Crab Cake was new to us...sometime you have to keep poking to look for the actual Crab Meat, but not at Echo & Rig...it was meaty, juicy...yummy.  Not having to pay extra for your favorite bottle of wine for two is nice, but receiving excellent service from the aforementioned staff is a very good thing...especially when Leone goes beyond merely shucking our oysters and paused to educate me...a very good thing indeed.  Echo & Rig can get crowded and a little loud on the weekends...you may prefer to come during the week or early/late on the weekend...but even during their rush you'll find it's well worth the time and money.",

I feel the exact opposite about this place. If I could get the char on my steak the way they do on theirs, I would only eat red meat.   We took my mom here when she visited and had the most pleasant time treating her to a fun, nice meal. Loved the servers, food was incredible, sides were amazing and reasonably priced, cocktails were fantastic. Just trying to figure out more reasons to go...",

    "text": "Oh, Echo & Rig - how I love you.  What can I say? It was just that good. I must admit, I was a little thrown off in the beginning with the hanging cow head that was on display from the outside. You know, the little things that make you regret being a carnivore inside?   I dined here with my family of four for my mother's birthday dinner. Let me start off by saying that every employee we had the opportunity to interact with was beyond amazing. From the hostess at the front to the manager who personally wished my mom a happy birthday. Hugo was our server; and he was incredible!  Appetizers started out with the bone marrow carne asada and maryland lump crab cake. Let me tell you, that bone marrow was amazing; it made that hanging cow head a little less depressing. For our main course we were a little sad to hear that the restaurant was out of rib-eye cap. However, we opted for the family style tomahawk steak. Cooked to medium-rare perfection and served with house-made garlic chips & mushroom Rockefeller.  The mushroom was not the greatest part of the meal, but eh whatever. It was served with all of the specialty sauces; some of which were not all that great. If you have to choose one - definitely take the brandied mushroom! Along with our main course, we opted for garlic mashed potatoes and a caesar salad. Both delicious, but lets be honest...how do you mess those up?  Following the main course, we shared a caramel turtle sundae. It was so yummy I almost cried. Seriously! I'm not really a sundae type of lady but I'll be back for that little guy again!",

Located in the beautiful Tivoli Village it has a great vibe at the bar. Here's what we got.  4 buck premium vodka cocktails, Hanger 1, yes!  2 buck, steak and egg app. The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender. A bit over cooked for my taste but made me want to return and try the full size version rare. The egg was perfect cooked as well. Really solid app.   2 buck shrimp cocktail app. Tiny little cutie shrimps tossed in cocktail sauce. I prefer my sauce a bit more spiced with horseradish but it was good. It came on a little bed of good quality salad greens. Over all this was good but I'd probably skip it next time.  1 buck hot dog with in house made sauerkraut. Man, I love me some meat, always skip the bun and this was good. Nice and charred with classic wiener flavor, takes me right back to pigtails and the park. The kraut was solid and the spicy mustard right on the money. I'd order this again for sure.     Echo and Rig, I'll be back.",

Nicholas and his crew made our visit one that left a great impression on my wife and I, one that out-beats most, if not all, steakhouses that we've been to on the west coast from L.A. to Vegas to the Northern California Bay Area, which includes SF's Bob's Steakhouse. i ordered the Porterhouse Lamb and my wife had the Filet Mignon, both cooked to perfection and accompanied by some awesome sauces. Not only did our server, Shane, know the menu like the back of his hand, he made some changes to the dishes to accommodate our unique requests, making our dishes the best that we've tasted. He also brought out a presentation tray of the cuts of meat, which you may want to ask for if you are filling brave enough to tackle one of these giant sized portions on. The busboy was also very courteous and polite and we didn't even know he was there until we needed something, which wasn't often as Shane had our needs meet promptly and precise. We can't say enough about this place, but only that we will be back on Friday to finish out our Vegas trip with another great dinner. PS, order the Portobello Mushroom Fries, delicious!",

For the appetizer we had the Portobello Fries and the Bone Marrow Carne Asada. The Portobello Fries was SO GOOD!! It comes with the perfect sauce, the herb aioli. This is definitely a must try!  For our main course, we decided to share the 35oz Tomahawk steak. It comes with potato chips and the Mushroom Rockefeller and 4 different types of sauces. The Steak was done just as we wanted, it was really good and having different sauces to try it with is a nice experience.  Overall, we had a nice time and we enjoyed the food at Echo and Rig!

    "text": "Was craving steaks for dinner last night-So went on yelp to find a local place in Summerlin .( My husband and I are new to Las Vegas. Go Knights!)  Food- the only great dish we found was the avocado toast with fresh burata and cherry tomatoes. The rib eye was cold and under cooked. I ordered medium rare and it came out mooing. Had to send it back.  The night start off with 1/2 hr delay for our reserved table. We had reservation for 7:45 , didn't get seated until 8:15. Can't read the menu cause it's like number 2 font and in very dim light . Many customers have to use their flashlight on their phones to read. Our waiter , Oscar was horrible. He hovered over the table and talk to us. I was afraid he would spit into our food on the table. When my steak needed to sent back to be recooked, my husband flagged him over . He approached our table, he beelined for the table next to us to answer a question then we had to flag him down for our request again. When we finished with our dinner, Oscar approached us for dessert , my husband said yes! We sat for 10 minutes waiting for the dessert menu. I just looked at our waiter to see if he's typing up the dessert menu. He went to the kitchen, then head to the computer station to put in an order, came over to 2 tables to get their orders, then went back to put their orders in.  Get the check for the table next door.. realized he had forgotten about us.  We didn't even look at the dessert. Was given him another chance to see if he will come over to ask about dessert, waited another 3-4 minutes.. nope no Oscar. I flagged down the manager and request for our check. It's disappointing that we won't be coming back.  Had much better food and service at Oscar's steakhouse, Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, heck even Outback Steakhouse have better quality service!",

    "text": "Decided to have dinner with my gf at the restaurant. We got seated etc. It took our server to take our order 30mins only for him to tell us he was trying to get an off menu list of food they had but didn't have it to begin then on him for him to show us. Soon after taking our order we'd expected to receive our main course after receiving our appetizers which were the oysters we ordered. Only for us to wait a full hour for our main course to arrive. Which also I may add we were ahead of another couple that which we got seated before them. As I paid attention closely they received their appetizers and then main course. Finished their food, paid, and then left. Which in this entire time we still have yet to receive our food. We then had to resort to speaking to another server and letting him know that it took our server appointed to us from the beginning to take our order 30mins and we were well within an hour to receive our main dish we ordered. Figuring out later  our main server had disappeared on us then for a totally different server to come with our food. Soon as our main dish arrived that's when suddenly our main server appeared out of nowhere. I'm not one to really complain about poor service but having to wait a full 30mins just too have our order taken and then another full hour for our main dish to be taken to our table is rather ridiculous. Which left a bad taste in my mouth and left me with no longer an appetite to eat and enjoy the food I ordered. Therefore I will not be returning to this place. Sadly I had high hopes for it seeing how it was indeed a very nice restaurant but I honestly won't be returning and would not recommend this restaurant too anyone who seeks to dine there in their quest to find a nice place to eat. Unless, you are willing to wait about an hour and a half to have your order taken then received..",

BOttomless mimosas Sundays till 3pm for $16 ! They generously  keep your glass full, offering different mixers such as white cranberry,orange juice, and grapefruit. Portobello fries are my favorite and you can't go wrong with the Blue crab cakes. The Crab cakes are nice and chunky pieces of crab. The aioli sauce is a bit heavy and i would prefer it on the side, but has a nice siracha kick to it. The steaks are amazing just ask what special cuts they have in, enough to split with another person. Ryan and Josh at the bar downstairs are on point with their service, consistently refilling our drinks, while juggling 10 plus customers at the bar and having genuine conversations with everyone.",

    "text": "Was invited here for a birthday dinner. We had a large party and to my surprise we were seated outside. It was a tad chilly outside, but they had heat lamps so it wasn't too bad. Not too fancy and big menu selection with decent prices. (Small salads: $9.30 & $11.40, soups $5.90, sandwiches $12.40, seafood dishes $21.70, entrees $19.60, side dishes $5.90/8.20/9.80, and various steak prices from $25.70-34.80)   Started out with the first thing that caught our eye on the menu: PORTABELLO FRIES & HERB AIOLI. So incredibly delicious! Deep fried giant slices of mushrooms that were to die! If they weren't about 10$ an order, I think we would have gladly ordered 5 of those alone!   FOR HIM: He ordered the COLORADO LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS that came with peewee potatoes, dried apricots and violet mustard. Well cooked and flavored, okay size for a $20 steak. He asked if there was a way to get a side of rice and they said no... even though I swear I saw rice included with a few of the entrees. But he devoured the whole thing easily and was overall satisified.  FOR HER: I ordered the JUMPING BEEF which were filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes and peruvian demi-glace. Very flavorful I must say, but was a little disappointed with only 4 little pieces of meat and the \"crispy potatoes\" it was topped with were french fries. I did enjoy the roasted tomatoes! Luckily I wasn't too hungry from already eating the portobello fries and bread with butter, otherwise I don't think this meal would have filled me up ordinarily.   Overall, a good dining experience. Wasn't too happy about being outdoors in the cold weather (and I would complain about that more if I wasn't dressed warmly that day with a long sleeve sweater & thigh high boots) and would have loved to dine inside, but the service was excellent and food was flavorful! Wouldn't say it's a place I would want to eat at often, but definitely nothing negative to say either. Definitely a place to try if you are a steak enthusiast!",

    "text": "Hubby and I came to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary. I chose Echo & Rig as our anniversary dinner based on Yelpers reviews. It was super easy to make a reservation, the woman on the phone was very nice. Other than that, I have to say I am very disappointed.  First, the restaurant was VERY loud. I understand it was VD and the restaurant was crowded, but the restaurant is all hard surfaces - glass and tile. The noise echoed throughout, making it very hard to have a conversation. Additionally, there was what sounded like dance or some sort of techno music playing (in the bar area directly below us, I presume. The bar area appeared to be small too, not for dancing) which made it even louder. I love me some techno, but in a restaurant where the main focus is a nice steak dinner? Not so much.  Second, the service was slow. In spite of what appeared to be 3 employees for every table, it seemed like everyone was moving at a snail's pace. Especially our server. Man, she was incredibly slow. She even spoke slowly. \"I'll let you...relax...and then I'll guide you...through the menu.\" Cue her meandering away.  Third, the steak was just slightly better than ok. I've had much much better steak at many other places, even right here in Portland. I was so looking forward to this, since they cut all the steaks in-house, but while that may sound special, it didn't seem to make any difference.  Fourth, the sides. They were either mediocre (mashed potatoes I am looking at you) or they were bad. The brussel sprouts were burned in places. We could have sent them back I guess, but at this point we had been there so long all I wanted was to get out of that noisy place.  Over all, I cannot recommend this place at all.  For the money, there are lots of other (presumably better) options. (And NOT those on the Strip.)",

    "text": "I was looking for a nice restaurant to go to with my family because we haven't been together in almost two years. So, about a month in advance, I sent an e-mail to ask some general questions and ended up being able to reserve a table for 4 a month in advance! Felicia, their Office Manager, was wonderful to work with.  When we checked in for our reservation, we were seated within minutes, even though we did arrive a little late (I was worried we'd lost our reservation!). I even took a few pictures downstairs because I thought their meat fridge had a funny quote on it (\"To Beef or Not To Beef?\"). Once we were seated, they came by with a huge tray of their meats. We ultimately decided on the 43oz Tomahawk steak because I had read reviews about how it was a must-try. To go with that, we ordered small dishes only: Butternut Squash, Pepitas, Strachatella & Honey ($6.40), Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce ($8.60), Pork Belly & Spicy Slaw ($9.80), Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli ($9.80), Grilled Thick-Cut Bacon & Barbecue Sauce ($8.60), and Mac & Cheese ($8.60).  Our server recommended we get the Tomahawk steak medium even though we as a family usually eat our steak medium rare. We trusted him on that one and we're glad we did! That was one of the best steaks I've had in my life. The outside was crispy and the inside was juicy and it had the perfect doneness for our taste. I even picked up the bone and started eating around it, it was that good. The small dishes were all good as well. Our favorite was definitely the Portobello Fries, followed by the Butter Squash and Mac & Cheese. The Lamb Cigars, Pork Belly Slaw, and Thick-Cut Bacon we probably could've skipped.  Service was excellent. Like I said, our server recommended that we get the medium even though we told him we usually like medium rare, but he was right on the money. They cleaned our table and set it up between the small plates and the steak. They also brought us all seven steak sauces so we didn't have to choose! I loved that. And they also came by to refill our drinks frequently and to check and see how we were doing. Between bites of food, I think we might have uttered out a \"great, thank you.\"  Super pleasant experience from even a month in advance to getting the check. I would love to bring my family back here next time we're all together.",

When I asked about the \"Wagyu\" beef selection, the famous waiter seemed foreign about it and expressed a little arrogance. Check out my pic of the spelling on their showcase of meats and it explains why. The matre'd Xavier  was awesome in delivering great service. This place is too loud on the inside so I would suggest outside balcony seating for a more enjoyable visit. We started out with a napa cab recommended by Xavier then with my steak I ordered a different blend. Both were good and pricey at $22/glass. I couldn't enjoy it as I didn't feel I was in a fine dining experience. We ordered the portabello fries which was complemented with a delicious pesto sauce. This was excellent!  We also ordered the onion soup which was okay.  The southern fried chicken salad was so tasty and yet it was light. We ordered a burger and a rib eye cap for our entree selection.  Both were excellent in taste and quality. I didn't like the dessert menu because there was no variety except for ice cream sundaes.",

The shrimp and artichoke was superb. Drinks delicious! I loved the dining upstairs, bar downstairs. Plus you can buy meat there and cook at home if you want. Restrooms clean. Prices decent for the quality of food.  Parking not so good..only had 2 parking spaces in front of the restaurant. But all else was great.",

The Yelp reviews had me wanting to eat here since May 2017 when we moved here from San Diego. We had a party of 13 for Doug's Birthday. Doug chose a Tomahawk Ribeye  41 oz. steak, chopped salad & Mac and cheese for our dining pleasure. Absolutely Delicious & On point. Our wait staff Beth was remarkable throughout the evening. She explained the farm to table menu, and answered all of our questions. She hustled and delivered the best service I have ever witnessed. This is also True for the entire staff AMAZING TEAM! David the manager greeted us early on as we were seating. He asked for feedback from 2 of our guests on issues with their entrees and made it right on their separate checks. As if this isn't enough, happy hour M-F  best deal and excellent staff to embibe as your guests arrive. Wonderful 1st Time here for all of us and from the entry station with friendly welcoming staff to the salt rub in the lavatory ... I am your tallest Fan! Thank you again BETH for a much needed night of enjoyment with our family.  Echo & Rig is my #1 steakhouse! Thank you David, you run a good ship! Excellent Staff! Deliciousness .",

My beef--we came here Saturday night for a lovely dinner with friends. It was SO HOT. Seriously. I'm always cold. I'm running a heater on my legs as we speak, and the temp in my building at work is set at 74 degrees. It's cold to me. And it's 104 outside. That's how ridiculous I am. But when we came here Saturday, I think their air broke or something. It was nicer on the patio with their misters.  We asked the waiter about it a few times, and he just kept telling us it was because they wouldn't shut the door. Honestly, we were here so long that I went to the bathroom 3 times and each time, a breeze would come in from the outside patio. It had to be over 80 degrees in there. Maybe even over 85. Even our wine was really warm. It made it not so pleasant to drink.   Our waiter was good. He was really slow to come around and take our orders. But once we placed the order, he was very attentive. We got there at 7:30 and we didn't leave until after 10pm. There was only 4 of us. I think he was very overwhellemed at first, and they seemed short staffed. He did bring us some icecream because he knew we were really hot, and fanning ourselves most of the night. It was nice of him...and because I'm sure he didn't want us to complain any further. ;)  The food was amazing, as always though. I had the Bavette cut, which was insaney better than I was expecting. Crazy tender and so flavorful. I LOVE a really well prepared and cooked steak.   I really do love this place, and I highly recommend when it's not crazy hot in there. But it was pretty shitty that we spent a good amount of money on being miserably hot, and drinking hot wine with our dinner.",

We had watched a movie at the Regal theatre (with the luxury loungers) and wanted to grab a late dinner. Echo and Rig was a wonderful surprise. Their butcher shop is on the main floor and the restaurant is one flight up. Great vibe. Service was as stellar as the food. Every dish was well thought out. We started with the fried spinach salad (ask for the dressing on the side) that was like a good intro to other awesome things to come. The mushroom fries was delightful. We decided to split our entrees. He got the steak with homemade chips while I got the shrimp with artichoke hearts and together, they made for an excellent surf and turf dish! Everything about our dinner was just perfect! I even enjoyed using the salt scrub in the ladies room on my hands! The only negative was having to listen to the manager flirt with female customers in the next table, it was kinda off-putting we decided to skip dessert. But overall, a really great find and would recommend this place to anyone!",

Especially since our waiter (who was otherwise amazing!) was not quite up to date on what they had or didn't have so he had to return to the table twice with bad news. They have a host who is comes to the table and is a little socially uncomfortable and the staff is incredibly rehearsed when chatting about the menu sounding forced.

The salad was very bland and was missing vegetables or something...anything. Wish we just went across the street to Brio or Cheesecake Factory where they have amazing salads. My friend had the quinoa salad and she had to add salt, pepper and lemon on her salad because it had no flavor.   What we did enjoy were the French fries and portobello fries. Those were both great.

    "text": "Yes, we went there at lunch time on a Saturday, but I still expect the establishment to have enough staff on, to do a good job for the customers.  I'm celiac and should have walked out as soon as I looked at the menu but we were close to a half hour before even seeing a menu and we just wanted to eat!  Almost everything was something I couldn't eat.  For the price one pays, it seems like places could keep gluten free bread in the freezer so that everyone could enjoy the menu.  We waited between 20 & 25 minutes for a table and as it was finally our turn to go upstairs to eat, we were told there was one table available for us right in the middle of the place.  No rugs so it was VERY noisy.  At around 100 degrees, but overcast and with a slight breeze, we opted to sit outside.  Got our tea within a few minutes along with the menu, and then waited another 20 minutes for a waiter.  We were just about to walk out when the waiter came back.  He said \"how are you\" and I said \"Hangry.\"  No apology or concern for the time we spent waiting since we got there.  45 minutes to finally have our order put in.  The food was fine, but mine was quite limited as I couldn't eat much on the menu.  I don't write many reviews, and I admit we were older than most of the patrons there, but can't help wondering if that's how they keep out us older folks who expect good service and food from the place.  And, no matter what, I always leave a healthy tip.  If I want to go get something from a limited menu with loud ambience again, I'll stop in at McDonalds for some fries.  And I'll get served faster too.  By the way, I worked several years as a chef in different high end restaurants, and when things worked well, it was because there was enough staff to do the job effectively.",

    "text": "Came here for my Birthday.  Was looking forward to \"picking\" my cut of meat. After all, it's a butchery.    I asked for a nice New York, 26oz or so.  The Waiter came back saying they only had a 20 - 21oz.  OK, I guess. Turns out they make cuts ahead of time, bring them around on platters, and you pick from that.   My Wife ordered the Rib Eye Cap.  Waiter comes back 5 minutes later saying they ran out of Caps.  Ordered a Tomahawk Rib eye (much more than she wanted) to get the cap from that.  Wow, so far 0-2, and it was only 6PM. Made me wonder what the choices would be available at 8PM.  Onward.  Drinks come, Appetizers come, Wine comes, all very good.  Then....  My New York Steak.   Impossible to cut with the supplied steak knife.  The reason? Gristle.  1/3 of the steak was inedible gristle and fat.  When the waiter came by to check on our status, I pointed that out, he apologized, but that was that.  No manager to come by and at least check the plate of Gristle and perhaps replace the steak.  Her Tomahawk Rib Eye. Cooked to perfection.  She enjoyed the cap part and gave me the rest since my steak was all but unedible.  Being local, and living in the area we like trying different restaurants available to us.  We expect to pay premium prices for \"high end\" restaurants.  We never mind spending $$$$ when we get the value.   The waiter was good, bus service good.  But really, if you're a butchery, the steaks should be flawless, you should be able to pick the size cut you want.  This one clearly was not, nor did I have much of a choice.  Will never go here again.  Too bad really.",

    "text": "Visiting the area and staying at the JW Marriott, we were seeking a unique place to enjoy a birthday dinner. On a suggestion, we decided on Echo & Rig and so very glad we did!   Conveniently located with valet service, this butcher shop/restaurant was an instant hit when we walked in the door. An open concept with a trendy feel, the immediate impression from the receptionists were warm and welcoming!  We sat at the bar for pre dinner drinks and enjoyed a sampling of the homemade beef jerky! It was fantastic!   We requested a balcony table because the inside seating was rather loud. We hoped to hear each other throughout the dining experience and it would be a challenge inside.  Because we asked for balcony, we had to wait a bit longer but we didn't care. The bar drinks, jerky and conversation were keeping a smile on all of our faces. Nevertheless, the manager approached us to apologize and presented us with complementary appetizers - tuna poke and watermelon & cucumber salad. Both were so light, fresh, and awesome!   Now I was even more excited about dinner!  We sat down and our waiters were attentive, funny, and professional - we could tell things were only going to get better.   Then, the waiter did it. He brought a wooden tray that held the massive cuts of beef available for purchase and boy, were they pretty!  The menu was loaded with so many tasty looking things we decided to make a buffer between the 4 of us.   We ordered a 40oz steak which arrived on the bone and was cooked perfectly! Our table also held all of the following: bone marrow, risotto, grilled cheese, crab cake, Brussels sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, grilled corn, and bottles of wine. Everything was fantastic!  I would definitely return! What a fun dining experience with a great view and table setting. Awesome service from everyone we met as soon as we walked in the door.  Only downfall - noise level inside, but that won't keep me away if we are in the area again. That grilled cheese with braised short ribs is calling my name!!",

    "text": "Unless you're sleeping under a rock, you know that Echo & Rig is one of THE best places on the west side. Let's start with their cocktails - every single one I've had (most recently the Cucumber Cooler & the Tequiling Me Softly) is well-balanced and shockingly NOT overpriced.   On to the food.  While there are many reasons to come here for brunch (the bottomless mimosas, the excellent selection, the quality of the food, etc), there is ONE reason that beats them all and that, my friends, is the bacon. Order a side of their thick-cut bacon and then, moments later, order another. Trust me on this.  Their dinner menu is out of this world as well. They have a huge selection of small plates that are excellent for sharing. Last night we had the steak tartare (TBH this was my least favorite item though - was a little bland), the bone marrow carne asada (inventive!), the octopus (tender), and a few other things. We also ordered the bacon (twice), obviously.  I'll be back, I'm sure, and SOON.  PS On a scale of 1-10 for ease of eating keto here, it's an 8.8 - the menu doesn't list what has gluten and what doesn't and there are many mystery sauces, but it's super easy to modify.",

What a beautiful restaurant! We were seated and sparkling water was offered. Bread came out. We were celebrating my friend who was newly engaged so it was nice that they brought out free portobello fries for us to try. OH BOY- they were heavenly.   We all ordered the Spencer steak with horse radish cream. I got the medium rare. We each got a side. We had kennebec salt/pepper fries, brussell sprouts, creamed kale and a beef tartare.   Everything came out so perfectly delicious. The spencer steak was about 8oz and it was plenty big. It came out with chips with the steak.   We all tried various creams and sauces. I enjoyed the horseradish cream and the bbq one. But to be honest, they were all delicious. The service was perfect. The staff was friendly, very informative and then provided us with a delicious dessert at the end to share. It was absolutely perfect. I was told you could also bring your own bottle of wine to the restaurant. So I will definitely have to do that next time. Also, I will need to try their brunch!",

Ive been 3 times and every single time was excellent nothing short. The Tomahawks that they present are almost perfectly done (I say almost because it wasnt sousvide and I make my own Wagu Tomahawks at home sousvide and of course mine are the best). The porkchop is so good id rather have that.  Ive taken a bunch of different friends and they all loved the place.

    "text": "Overall: It was ok.   This came highly recommended from friends and family so perhaps they had a better experience than tonight. So highly recommended that we drove from the strip all the way to Tivoli Village (30 min drive approx).  The ambiance is very nice, we received a very warm greeting upon arrival and were seated promptly on a busy night without a reservation. Upon being seated we were greeted by the manager and addressed by name.  We sat on the patio which overlooks a beautifully lit water fountain, enclosed by soft lighting and warm architecture. Chairs were very comfortable and the patio was nice and warm, even though it was a little on the chilly side outdoors.  The service overall was decent but not the top-notch attentiveness that we noticed other guests receiving (perhaps they're regulars, who knows).   I wasn't expecting a Michelin level of service, however, friends and family raved about how awesome this place was so I had high hopes. The prices are very reasonable, $25-36 for a steak and wine options starting about $40/ bottle.  Upon ordering, we were promptly served fresh bread, smooth butter & sparkling water. We placed our orders, and management sent us a tomato watermelon plate in advance as their apologies for the delay in the arrival of our food (I wasn't bothered by the wait, it felt like an acceptable length of time.)   After receiving our food, the level of service we were receiving faded.   We didn't have a large appetite so we went with tapas and sandwiches. Neither the burger nor steak chimichurri arugula sandwich met our hopes but the mac n cheese was absolutely DELICIOUS. The steak on the sandwich was (medium) was burned, maybe cooked in a hurry, but burned. I didn't want to look like an ass going to a steakhouse and asking for a sauce to drown it in. The burger wasn't bad but far from amazing... let's compromise with \"ok\".   As the night continued, refills were promptly refilled by the attendants, just the overall level of service from our actual waiter fell flat as he gave nearly all of his attention to the party next to us.   I was very pleased with the presentation and plating that they received, I especially loved the part where they brought out their steak cuts prior to cooking and then brought out delicious juicy steaks. I wish we could've had whatever experience they received because everything seemed to be delightful at that table.  Perhaps our problem was going the wrong night, with the wrong appetites, ordering the wrong thing.   We ate 1/2 of our food, still left a reasonable tip, and just called it a night.  The waiter offered to give a comp, but we value your efforts (not those people who complain just to get free stuff) and what it takes to run a restaurant.   Nevertheless, I really really wanted to love it, but unfortunately, the best steak I've eaten in this town wasn't served here.",

    "text": "Very bad experience the past 2 times here. Was a few Sundays ago.  1st time received raw chicken oysters. They didn't separate it well enough before frying. fries where undercooked as well and not hot- like they came from the fry bowl set on the side  2nd time I came here, salad had soo much sand, they didn't wash their greens before serving. Also my rib eye was overcooked. I give up. I don't even see a chef watching what comes out of the kitchen. Food like this should never hit a table.   Our whole table ordered a drinks as well. My girl never received her wine. She was the first to order. They forgot.  We came here right after lunch before dinner.   Menu is great if executed correctly. Fast food places are more consistent. Group of 5- spent about $250 including tip. $50 check average for a nice ambiance. Would just buy a steak downstairs and grill it at home",

    "text": "I am not sure how this place has such good reviews... unless we just came on a bad day. We had reservations for our group of about 12-16 people for our friend's bday on a Saturday for brunch.   So where do we start....  1. They were trying to seat us at 2 different tables where 3 of us would be at a separate table. They decided to put tables together so we can sit at one table but then half the group sitting on the booth side weren't able to get out..  2. We had several different workers come to the table getting the birthday girl wrong when we already told them who the birthday girl was.   3. Some of us sitting on the other side of the table had sun in their eyes from the window and I believe it was the manager who decided to get a large napkin type thing with scotch tape to cover it up. Asked one of us in the booth to move so the waiter can stand up on it to put it up. Classy...  4. After ordering, we were told that some of us would get our entrees before others and we asked that we get it all at once... Half of our table got their orders about 40 mins before the other half. They said that some orders take longer than others but some of us had ordered the same exact thing but still received our food at almost an hour apart.... so half the table were already done eating when the other half just began.   5. Also, when they brought out the food, they were handing it to the wrong person. Everyone at the table were switching their dishes and drinks. Smh.  6. Mimosas are a ratio of Champagne and juice, they kept pouring our glasses all the way to the top with Champagne and kept forgetting to bring out the juice.  7. They brought out 3 different sundaes for what they thought were 3 people's bday lol. And then a few moments later, another waitress brought out 3 more sundaes... and ended up just giving it to us. Not complaining about that but for the fact they they are so unorganized and confused.   I can keep on going but i'll leave it at that. We had so many different people waiting our table and I'm not sure if this was training day for the workers or what but every single worker looked confused or like it was their first day of work. It was a busy afternoon but I'd think they'd have some better service and should be used to busy days since they are considered a fancy steakhouse.  Although their food was really great and maybe they were just having a bad day, I'm not sure I will ever come back...",

We had a early dinner so probably don't need reservation unless you go for dinner at peak hour. We were greeted right away and escorted to stairs to go to our dinner table. I feel that hostess  should of asked us if we were able to walk up stairs and offer alternative as a courtesy even if can't see physical ailment  ( I have a knee issue). Seemed more of casual atmosphere which I wasn't expecting due to moderate price of menu. Tables were all together and not much privacy. The music piped in seemed more like we were at party then nice dinner. I We were greeted by server Luke who was friendly and knowledgeable about menu, he spoke a little fast though. I had skirt steak and potato chips came with it, which I would encourage chef to change that item  offered with steak( chips) The steak was tasty with red wine Demi sauce. I usually have mine MR but server recommended Medium which I did enjoy. I had kale salad with tasty citrus dressing. I prefer no stems on the kale. My husband ordered the lamb chop which he rated fair \"too chewy\". The manager ( I think, he didn't introduce himself) did come around and ask us how was Everything. Appreciated The spanish waiter who brought us ice cream with toppings with candle and had a BEAUTIFUL voice!",

He took our order for drinks. Drinks came, and all of us looking at the menu. A few minutes later, he asked what the kids are going to be eating. We ordered the kids food. Half an hour later, the kids food came and then he showed us the types of meat and cut that they're serving. He asked the bday boy what kind of meat he likes to eat. Our friend ordered his food. An hour later, our server still hasn't taken ALL of our order. We started getting annoyed cause he was catering to the tables around us (4 tables to be exact. 2 ea. On 3 and our party of 8). We had to asked another person if they can take our order, he eventually came and took all our order.  Our 645 reservation, our food didn't arrive until almost 9pm.  We weren't really sure if our server was having a bad day but the way we were treated, I'm for sure not coming back to this establishment.",

We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving, just in time to get a drink at the bar. We came for my husbands birthday. I subtly mentioned this to the hostess because she asked what brought us in.   She must've told the manager because they made sure our whole dining experience was phenomenal! The manager checked in on us a few times making sure we were satisfied etc. All while being super friendly and getting to know us a bit. Our waiter was also friendly and very prompt with water refills because my husband drinks A LOT of water with meals ha.   We chose to sit in the outdoor patio. Absolutely loved the ambience and it was more than warm enough with the heaters as well.   I had the scallops and my husband had the NY strip. Both were amazing!! They surprised my husband with the caramel turtle dessert. Which was superb and very thoughtful!   Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and I'd say it's an absolute must try when in LV.",

    "text": "It was my first visit here today and I can't even explain how great it was. It's such an excellent place for brunch!   First, the food. I ordered the steakhouse scramble. I believe it consisted of filet mignon, potatoes, egg scramble, bell peppers, onion, etc.. it was so delicious, light and filling! I ordered coffee on as well and it was so good (I had 4 cups). We also ordered the bacon and avocado which was also amazing. To finish off, we ordered the dark chocolate cherry sundae and the berry sundae which were both so good. My cherry sundae consisted of chocolate ice cream, cherries, walnuts, and some type of cherry candy. I can't say enough good things about the food, you must go and try it yourself!!  Second, the service was amazing. The waiters were constantly checking up on us and they were very attentive. I wish I got their names but they were in the bar area. Another thing is that we walked in there (around 11ish) and they said that the next available table would be at 1:00. However, the bar area is first come first serve so luckily we got a little spot over there. I would recommend making reservations ahead of time.   Overall, it was such a great experience. The waiters were so friendly and the food was so good. I really would like to come back for dinner one day. And also, on the price range list I'd say it's in between $$-$$$. Can't wait to come back one of these days!  P.S. they offer Yelp cash back!!  **also just wanted to add that the restrooms were immaculate and so boujee. They had a complimentary hand scrub which was a must.",

    "text": "Been here a few times and usually for a celebration.  Service can be a hit or miss type of deal. However, food is always excellent (except for the desserts which I'll get to later).   So why 3 stars? It was my friend's birthday and she had a reservation for 8:30pm for a group of 20. Tell me why we didn't get seated until 9:20pm? I understand it's a large group but don't promise us a reservation for a certain time if you can't accommodate. I consider myself a pretty patient person but even I was getting hangry having to wait that long. That knocked off 1 star for me. Onto the food.  Appetizer: Mussels with shoestring frites in lobster broth - Mussels on the smaller size but they were sweet and perfectly cooked. You get a good size portion for the price. I thought the shoestring frites were actual fries but they're more like the ones you ate as a kid from the yellow can, except these were fresh.   I also had some of my friend's portobello fries and they were fried perfectly and texture was perfect.   Entree: Flat iron steak sandwich: this was so good! The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was so tender. It came with a side or crispy potato chips.   I tried my friend's grilled cheese with short rib and that was bomb! I would get that next time. The Drunken Goat is another great option if you're going for meat-free.   I knocked down another star because of the dessert. I was so disappointed! My friends and I ordered the apple pie and berry shortcake. I could've made these at home. The \"apple pie\" was literally 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, 2 sugar cookies, and topped with cold apples with cinnamon. How the heck is this apple pie? Same for the berry shortcake (2 scoops vanilla topped with berry mixture and shortcake cubes). No effort at all into the dessert. I was still mad about the \"Apple pie\" when I got home that night.",

Being a chef I obviously asked alot of questions about there menu and the waiter and manager answered all my questions with exact and knowledgeable responses. I had inquired about the pork belly but did not order it and the manager saw that on our ticket and brought it over for us to try and also brought us a couple different sauces to try and everything was spectacular! they also brought me a completely hand made desert they're ice cream all made in house along with the candied peanuts house made carmel and shaved chocolate was absolutly delicious I can not even begin to express how perfect that was. They also have a salt scrub in the bathroom to leave ur hands feeling brand new! The drinks were perfect as well we asked for an off the menu drink and it was made to perfection along with they're wine selection being quite delicious! All around a perfect dining and entertaining experience! They are very apriciated!",

We were bombarded with people the minute we walked in and had a hard time finding a nice atmosphere due to the blinding lighting (it was 7 pm) and it looked like broad daylight. We got our starter within 10 minutes but after 45 minutes and watching other, newer bar mates receive their food we asked about ours.The bartender said \"do you want me to check on it?\"... That should have been the first warning. He came back and waited  on other guests and we finally got his attention to ask if he found out about our food and he said yes, 10 more minutes, when we said it it had a long time so he said the kitchen was backed up ( there were 2 others at the bar and 2 other 2 tops in site). We then waited more than 10 with no word or apology so we asked for the check (twice). We couldn't pay until the bartender got his manager and he came over saying our food was coming but we were literally trying to leave at this point. I am most sad that I wanted so badly to eat here, the food looked great and other than the horrible lighting in an otherwise nice atmosphere the restaurant was just a compete miss, we won't be back and really hope they can get it together so others can enjoy a potentially great restaurant. Shame, shame. Summerlin needs a good restaurant that can stick around. Unfortunately, I don't think they can cut the mustard. This is bad for all of us.",

    "text": "My Wife and I are self professed foodies and frequently dine out in this incredible culinary Mecca of Las Vegas.  After all the rave reviews about Echo & Rig, we were looking forward to another Sin City delight. We had our chance last night and first impressions did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is airy and the host staff was courteous and polished.  After seating, the Manager personally greeted us and welcomed us as first timers and introduced his waiter who gave us a splendid review of the menu and the trimmings.  After the menu introduction, he brought an up sell meat board to our table to present large share steaks.  When asked if all steaks presented were prime cut quality, we were told that some were Japanese wagyu and others from a prestigious cattle ranch.  Game on!  We ordered the 44 oz tomahawk rib eye with garlic cheddar mashed potatoes, fried egg asparagus and a crab cake appetizer.  The bus staff was efficient close to the point of annoyance but a welcome reprieve from being ignored in some reputable eateries.  From this point forward things turned around a bit.  The waiter told us ahead of time that our large rib eye would take a bit longer to cook and would be served to us medium.  We fully understand the extended wait time and eagerly waited for the monster Dino bone to arrive.  The steak arrived sliced tight on the bone by one of the support staff along with our side dishes all looking fabulous.  The waiter very briefly glanced by the table to ask about satisfaction before being given the opportunity to inspect.  A quick okay and on his way. We separated the steak and found most of the expensive meat to be nearly raw.  A bite of the end piece was chewy and not the superior quality we expected.  The potatoes were cold and pasty and the fried egg asparagus was little more than a cold fried egg on overly al dente asparagus.  We waited for some time for the waiter to respond to us for a satisfaction check without luck.  The efficient bus crew arrived at the table before being able to speak with the waiter to ask if we were saving the meal.  At that point we decided to box up the uneaten steak to slice up for sandwiches later.  After sitting for some time with our carry out back at our side, the waiter finally stopped by for the glowing review and was shocked to learn of our dissatisfaction.  He asked if we would like to speak with the manager which felt like a bit of an insult.  An establishment with a glowing reputation would send the manager without question for resolution. To further the insult, the waiter whisked away and reviewed  our signed bill while we were gathering our belongings at the table presumably to make sure his gratuity had been added. At this point, we felt our review and the loss of our future business would be most appropriate.  On to the next adventure.",

    "text": "This steakhouse was okay-good.  Not great, not spectacular, just okay-good.  The martinis are amazing and the portobello mushroom fries are spectacular.  But the service is ok.  We had a manager come over and greet us after we had sat for about 12 minutes.  He was the same manager we had just seen at the bar finishing off a half glass of wine.  Pretty unprofessional if you ask me.  The waiter we had was again ok.  Nice guy but really had no sense of urgency.  I will say the water guy and bus guy was on it.  Made sure we had full glasses of water at all times.  Really the only people working hard.  Everyone else in suits just walked from one side of the restaurant to the other trying to look important but did very little the improve the experience.  The waiters follow suit.  Steak was good but nothing spectacular especially for the price.  This is one of those places that sides do not come with a steak.  Mac and cheese was terrible and dry.  Stuffed mushroom was gross and dry.  And you can't order a salad without ordering it like a meal at $13.  I will probably never return.",

First, this place is beautiful but classy with a sweeping staircase taking you from the large and well provisioned bar to the dining room upstairs. Having heard the volume can be somewhat loud and wanting a more intimate experience, we asked for the terrace. Even though it is outside, the heaters were great! It was the perfect balance of being able to look over the beautiful Tivoli and feel warm too. On to the service; it was perfect. We were given the \"spiel\" and the wine we brought was opened (with no corkage fee!!) and poured like we had just gotten the most expensive wine on the menu. After we ordered, it was like the water and wine fairy just kept our glasses filled without us even noticing. The food was also stellar, especially the pork belly and grits, the bacon and the brussels sprouts. We each had a different steak and they were all cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor which was just enhanced by the little sauces they serve on the side. Overall, a great experience and I will be stopping by every time I am in Vegas from now on.",

We finally went to eat there tonight since we got a sitter. The place looked amazing. The hostess takes you passed the butcher area up the stairs to the restaurant. When we got there she sat us in the corner which I thought was nice since I was on a date with my wife. We were greeted right away by someone offering us our choice of sparkling or still water. After that it went down hill. The server took about 15 minutes to come over to even talk to us. Then he gave me a hard time when I asked about the menu. He said he was going to get us bread and would be right back. He didn't show up until after our small plate of garlic shrimp showed up...which by the way is not what it sounds like. It's shrimp chunks and a crouton. Then he disappeared for another 20 minutes until they were serving the steaks. When dropping the entree off he asked if we would like anything else. I asked for the drink menu... He forgot the menu.  Then he didn't show up until we were almost done with our food and I asked again. He leaves right away and comes back. I ordered a beer and it didn't come until we were done. Then we realized he never brought the Mac and cheese we ordered that we saw such great reviews about. He did at least apologize and told is he failed us. The only saving grace was how perfectly cooked the steak was. Also the mushroom stuffed with bacon and garlic chips were good. The chimichurri was straight up oil... But the horseradish sauce was delicious. I wish this experience would of been better, the location and potential for this place is great. I honestly would give this a worse review based on the service if I didn't like the steak so much.",

He sat another group after us, took their orders before us, and of course they got their food before us. Anyway, the second time around was ridiculous. We had reservations at 8:30pm for a friend's birthday dinner. Tell me why we didn't get seated until about 9:20pm!! Everyone was already there waiting so it's not like they were waiting for everyone to arrive. I'm pretty sure if we showed up 50 min. late we would have lost our reservations. Definitely 1 star down for that!  As for the food it was pretty good. I ordered the Maryland lump crab cake for an appetizer and it was yummy!! Lots of crabmeat!!! My friends ordered the portobello fries and the mussels with shoestring fries for appetizers. The portobello fries were really good especially with the aioli sauce. The mussels were okay in my book. For the main course I ordered the grilled cheese with short ribs. It was amazing!! I ordered that the first time I went also and I think this time around it was even better! One of my friends ordered the drunken goat sandwich, that was actually pretty good also.  But let's talk about the dessert, I was totally disappointed in their desserts!!! We ordered the apple pie & berry shortcake sundaes. They were both just sad, sad desserts. The apple pie was just a scoop of ice cream with dry ass apples & a sugar cookie stuck in it. They lost another star for these crappy desserts. They need to redo their dessert menu!!! I probably won't be back for awhile unless someone decides to come here for a special occasion.",

Tivoli Village is a great atmosphere to begin with, and the ambiance of the restaurant helps keep that feeling of luxury and style afloat without being pretentious or stifling.   It was by chance that my family first found Echo & Rig and we were sooo happily surprised by what we  found. The servers are well versed in the menus and can tell you all about the origins of the kitchens ingredients.  They have a good list of  bone-out steak options in the 8 to 12 oz portions, but what steaks the show are the a la cart bone-in cuts!  Ask your server to see the bone-in steaks and out comes a tray with monster cuts of beef. New York, T-bone, or tomahawk ribeye, the quality of the meat is visible from the other side of the table! And cut to feed the table, 39 oz tomahawk is nothing but jaw dropping.  Served with a variety of different sauces to please your palate, as well as a host of small plate appetizer/sides to choose from, Echo and Rig the dining experience fun and full of tasty morsels.  I highly recommend coming in and experiencing the fancy food in a casual and contemporary dining atmosphere. It's not cheap, but for the quality you find on your plate, the price is quite reasonable.",

Everyone asks multiple times if you are OK.   But after we left we thought about what we were actually there for and realized the massive service roll out masks the fact that this place is terrible at the basics.  We had to wait 35 minutes for our reserved table. One of the side dishes to our mains came to the table 20 minutes before all other dishes and got cold in isolation. The medium steak had to be sent back. We are not fussy but it was so rare it was cold. The steaks were not anything special.  I will not go back. It was exhausting having a dozen different people ask how you are when the failure to deliver the basics shows they dont really care.",

Out of all of my visits, I remember Lauren and Oscar also- they are amazing servers. I highly recommend their brunch: Short Rib Hash, Breakfast Sandwich, bottomless mimosas (and you get to pour the amount of champagne vs orange juice which I loooove!)  For dinner, the lasagna is really good, Portobello Mushroom fries are a must, all the steaks are incredible and you can grab your own cuts of meat to cook at home  at the butcher shop on the 1st floor. I also enjoy the corn and Mac & cheese for sides.   All of the cocktails are yummy but I'm personally a fan of their Bourbon Cassowary cocktail- it's very booze forward.

    "text": "FOOD RECOMMENDATION: YOU CANT COME HERE AND NOT TRY THE PORTOBELLO FRIES! The aioli dipping sauce is amazing!   EXPERIENCE:  I've come here several times for brunch and loved it. I often sit on the patio when the weather is nice. Service has always been great. Except once. I came for my birthday with my mom and wanted to order a glass of wine from the HH menu. My server told me I would need to go downstairs and order it from the bar myself as they couldn't honor happy hour prices anywhere but the bar. Went to order my drink and the bartender was a jerk. I mentioned I wanted Chardonnay and he named off all brands that they had, never mentioning that it was happy hour and they had a Chardonnay on there (which was actually very good). The person next to me at the bar actually passed me their happy hour menu.  The bartender seemed bothered that I wanted to order from that menu instead. It just sucks b/c you choose a place to celebrate a special event/day then you're treated poorly. ANNOYING! I didn't let his dry attitude didn't ruin my birthday dinner.   My server was amazing and brought a birthday dessert and a sang HBD! Food was amazing. No complaint on my meal or my mom's. I will be back for sure. I just know not to go for happy hour when I have to deal with the crummy bartender. Will probably only come for brunch.",

We ordered the Short Rib Hash based on the recommendation of the super friendly butcher downstairs before being seated. We also ordered the Farmer's Market Breakfast and the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes  In order, I'd rank them #1 Farmer's Market Breakfast, #2 (tie) Short Rib Hash, #2 (tie) Blueberry Buttermilk Pankcakes. The problem with the hash was that it was bland. The potatoes were cooked to perfection, they just weren't very flavorful. I also wish there was a bit more meat in the dish. I really liked the vegetables in the Farmer's breakfast. The pancakes were good, and I appreciated the real maple syrup.  Our server was attentive, if a bit matter-of-fact. The water server was nice, but unfortunately had just started and hadn't yet tried any of the menu to give any recommendations. I'd recommend to management that they allow all employees to sample the menu so they can offer recommendations to guests.  If I lived in the area, I'd come back to sample the dinner menu, but not sure I'd make the trip out from the strip again.",

This was our first visit, we tend to like T-Bones, SW Steakhouse, Prime....but since we recently moved into One Queensridge, we decided to support our neighbors. Well what a disaster! We were led upstairs and sat at the most embarrassing \"bistro\" type table that was not only unstable but was meant for either children or the smallest humans on earth. I can't imagine spending several hundred dollars on a bottle of wine and at least that much on dinner just to sit at a pathetic cafeteria style tin table. For such a pricey restaurant one would think they would invest in better seating for their high paying customers. Needless to say, we declined to stay, told them no thank you and we wouldn't be back. We had better service and were very comfortable at Brio. Don't waste your money here, drive up the street to the awesome T-Bones...you'll thank me!",

First incident was a dinner with my parents a few months ago. I chose not to do a review and maybe try to see if this was a exceptionally bad moment for them and that they can resurrect it. I probably shouldn't have as I completely forgot that the reason why dinner with friends was exceptional and we had some comped items was because they messed something up on the groups check the week prior they dined without me.  Anyways back to dinner with my parents The wait was 90 minutes, but then the food service was so slow and full of mistakes we were stuck there another 2 hours. I will spare the details but basically it was long wait to order something...appetizers came eventually...i was told that they didn't have what I ordered so I changed my entree....waiting...waiting...waiting....then we had to send back food multiple times. I am one of those people who don't send back small errors... We dine out a lot and asked for a refire twice this entire year, one of them being this. All of my vegetables were raw, my fish not cooked right. My fiance's steak was sent back THREE times because medium rare wasn't a possibility. A ribeye shouldn't be half a inch thin to where they can't get a steak to anything but well done. I have not been to a place where the staff knew how bad it was and comped the entire meal and gave me a card and asked to let them know when I will be back for dinner so they can ensure it went well. Unfortunately, it was the 1 day my parents were in town and did not bode well for me as a host. I'm now stuck to chain restaurants because I am not trusted to take them to small businesses now. They rather go to PF Changs.  I havent dined for dinner since and tried instead to do cocktails and snacks to ease into this place again.   I went with drinks with friends and it was just OK in terms of food and drink. We sat in the tiny tables downstairs against the snack station which wasn't comfy and feels more suited to being used as seating for those waiting to dine in, than any sort of service. Service wasn't attentive.   Went with friends most recently and I was just done with the long waits for a place to sit and not being able to handle the crunch with a backed up kitchen again. Good thing I overheard people complaining and some frustrated looking tables so that I got a headsup. I didn't want to sit for hours so I decided to opt out of getting food at all. Got a drink and left.   This place will keep being busy because of location alone. There's few places worth the wait and this is not it.",

The portabella mushroom fries were to die for and the green sauce was super good. The pork belly and beef sausage were the best the table had ever had. Then the real meal. I had the spencer and it came out perfectly cooked. Their homemade chips were tasty and a great accent to the dish. We also got Brussel sprouts with the meal. Normally brussels are super bitter, but these ones were amazing! Super good and will come back",

The drinks were on point (I had a \"seascape\" with Kettle One and a glass of house Cabernet with the main course.) and the menu selection had a nice range. The fried spinach salad was probably one of the best salads I've ever had. Period. The mac n cheese was cheesy and delicious. The chips that were served with the steak were flavorful and crispy and the mushroom cap was a nice touch to the plate. The wait staff were awesome. They were close by and made sure the table was always cleared and the water was topped off. The fresh cut lemons on the table were a nice touch as well. The steaks were cooked to perfection. I had the Spenser Cut and Mrs C had the Rib Eye Cap. Trust me. You want to try all of the sauces and they will let you. We recommend the blue cheese and the horseradish sauces the most but all were great. Unbelievably they comped us dessert (which we didn't ask for but it was exactly what we were going to order anyway)! It was the Caramel Turtle and it was seriously ridiculously good. I asked my wife what the name of the dessert was and she said \"wait a second while I finish having sex with this ice cream in my mouth\". Enough said. Eat here. You will be happy you did.",

    "text": "OMG!  This is the place to go if you are a local here!  Located in Tivoli Village, recently open (meaning less than a year old), this place is amazing!  I was first introduce to this place because my fiance heard about this place being raved about by his colleagues.  We came here for lunch and received the best service for a fine dining experience.  Usually when you go to a fine dining establishment during their \"non-busy\" hours, service has a tendency to be lacking but not this place!  Our server, Alex I believe was wonderful!  And everything he recommended was excellent.  He checked up on us when needed and wasn't to overbearing on attention.  It was just right.  The first thing he suggested was the Portobello Fries with Herb Aioli; it was battered lightly and when you take your first bite, you crunch and then you chew.  The mushroom is just soft and tender.  As our main course, we ordered the Hanger: Herb Marinade, grass fed and Skirt Steak: Hawaiian Cowboy, Wyoming Wagyu.  My entree was the Skirt steak, marinaded in a sweet soy sauce with a bit of a kick in spice.  So it was sweet & spicy.  The steak was tender and melted in your mouth.  As for the Hanger, wow, the flavor was just right!  The herbs that marinaded the steak was smokey and tantalizing in your mouth.  You can taste the smoke wood that the steak was grilled on with hints of simply seasoning of salt & pepper and herbs.  For the side we ordered the bloomsdale spinach, unlike regular spinach that wilt & shrink when cooked, they were crisp and mouth full!  The taste was sweetly bitter that you want to keep eating!  Unfortunately by the time we where done with our meal, we didn't have room for dessert.  So this would mean that we would go back and repeat the same thing again.  Now before I finish this review, I forgot the most uniquely important thing about this place...it's the butcher shop, the deli, smoothie counter and the bar!  When you first enter, you see a nicely set-up freezer that house all the meat you can possibly dream of!  From steak, to pork, to lamb...sausage...your mouth will drool!  To the deli station where if you are on the go, they make your sandwiches there while you watch.  With cured ham and all the deli meats that are \"hangable\" to lust after.  It also shares it's space with a smoothie counter where they literally take real fruit and make your smoothie or fruit juices in front of you.  You see all that goes into your healthy beverage!  Now if you are in the mood to be a little bit of an adult, the bar is conveniently located downstairs.  So while you wait for your table, you have ample space to sit at the bar or the lounge and enjoy a cocktail.  Overall the ambiance of the place is magnificent and greatly needed on this side of town!  I know where I will be going to get my meat when I am making pot roast or steak dinner.  I know where to go hang out with the girls for a low-key girls night out and enjoy gossiping!  This is definitely the place to be and so happy to have something like this on my side of town!  Better than Town Square!",

Beautiful restaurant with excellent service. We went around 1pm and on a Thursday afternoon there was plenty of seating. The only thing that I would do is revalidate the cook on your steaks with the server. Our server/cook may have mixed ours up but in the end it didn't matter because the food was excellent and our server was helpful and kind. I asked for my ribeye to be medium rare and for my wife's Spencer steak to be medium, they accidentally swapped that up. Still 5 from me and we will be back hopefully 20 times or more.",

We had a tapas style meal and ordered the spinach salad, portobellos fries, cauliflower, garlic mash, broccoli, skirt steak and jumping beef. Everything was devoured.  Service was excellent but I have to give credit to Aaron. He works at the butcher section downstairs and the guy is skilled, passionate and dedicated to his job. He makes time to give you a lesson on something every time I go in. Definitely sad to see him leave soon but I wish him the best on his new adventure.  He's the reason we kept going every week but I can see us eating there a lot more frequently now. Once again, absolutely fantastic and cheers Aaron.",

Forget the 40+ ounces of meat. Bye bye lover. I can tell you that the Bevette was spectacular to the last bite. Veggies are so delish. Farm to table is the way to go.

The upstairs features an indoor dining room as well as a large balcony area with plenty of seating - and heaters when it's cool. The staff is so friendly and helpful and always going above and beyond for the guests.   We have gone to Echo and Rig with kids before, but it's not really a restaurant that is too kid friendly. The atmosphere is laid back and quiet and kids usually get bored pretty quickly with no tvs to distract them or other activities going on. Echo and Rig is a great steakhouse for a date night or a family brunch.",

If you don't feel like cooking the best steaks you can buy, go upstairs to the restaurant and have a great job.    Definitely order the Portobello Fries... those are awesome.  Could be a trendsetter.  Any of their sandwiches are fantastic... The BLT and Porchetta sandwich are my favorites The crown jewel of the brunch menu is the short rib hash.   The real specialty of Echo & Rig is the butcher shop.  Not cheap, but by far, the best quality meat you can buy in Las Vegas. Makes the BB or VM&W look like Walmart's meat case by comparison.    They also make their own pate, sausage and other charcuterie which changes daily. Always something new or unusual you don't see anywhere else.  Butchers will cut to order just about anything for you as long as they have it in stock.  If you want super thin sliced shabu-shabu style, or a 50oz (4-5 inch thick) bone in ribeye... they will cut it for you.  When I ordered pork chops, the butcher went back and brought out a whole side of pork, then broke it down by hand and hand carved some 1.5in thick rib chops, rind off, but fat ring still on.  Just incredible when grilled over oak charcoal.  The fat from the Niman ranch pigs is so rich and flavorful and is very soft to the bite. Whereas supermarket pork chop fat ring can be tough and hard and usually have to cut it off at the plate.  Definitely buy their hamburger patties... because it is ground from their prime steak trimmings after cutting the steaks for the restaurant.  Usually always available.",

Oh my gosh. I was blown away with how scrumptious both were considering it was take-out and I was eating it presumably 3 hours after it had been prepared. The steak sandwich surprisingly had a generous amount of steak, which was also cooked to perfection. The chiles in the sandwich were soft and flavorful and really elevated the sandwich. By the time I had the calamari, they were no longer crispy, yet every morsel was still an explosion of flavor. The sauces make the dish even better (try the green stuff!). Overall, I would definitely like to come and try this place in person, with fresh food.",

    "text": "We're frequent visitors to LV who were coming back for the rib cap...  So we'd been here for lunch on a Monday before.  We came in for Saturday this time and found out it was brunch.  We wanted the bone marrow and steaks which aren't on the brunch menu.  The server and manager went to see what they had.  Turns out, any steak we wanted, from the Tomahawk to the ribeye cap to the Wagyu were available.  But not the bone marrow.  :(  We also got mac and cheese off the steak sides menu.  And portobello fries from the brunch menu.  Plus we were looking at the burger in the butcher fridge downstairs, so we split that 3 ways for an appetizer.  Fresh chips for everyone!  Did I say we enjoyed it all?  We did.  Great meat, great cuts.  My ribeye cap was medium rare as ordered throughout except for a little rare bit in the center.  The smoke from the red oak grill flavored the steaks and burger.  And the sides were fantastic.  Bearnaise, chimichurri, and horseradish cream sauce for the table.  I think places like Echo and Rig are why we get the car rental when we are in Vegas.  So we can get out and about to Summerlin and Chinatown, and In 'n' Out.  Big ups to Avis on upgrading my full size to a Cadillac ATS for the weekend.",

    "text": "I made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday - dinner for us. They have contact information to make reservations ahead of time on their website, but I wanted to try my new app, and it worked successfully! The restaurant had our reservation with no hiccups.  We had gotten there about 15 minutes earlier than the reservation time 'cause I figured there'd still be a night crowd on a Sunday, and I had read previous Yelp reviews about patrons still having to wait even though reservations were made. Anyway... We get there, and I was right. There were 2 large groups and a few couples already waiting at the hostess' podium. I think I overheard someone say that she was helping another group settle in, but no biggie. She was nice and chatted it up with us when showing us to our table, and it only took us about 10 minutes to get to our table after checking in. In that time frame, the boyfriend got to look around the butcher shop which he found cool and unique for a Vegas restaurant.  Shortly after being seated, the manager, Lisa, introduced herself and wished my boyfriend a \"happy birthday.\" That was quite thoughtful of her. Also noticed that she checked on other patrons throughout the night as well. Now that was impressive for a manager 'cause I rarely see that. Our server Ramon and his assistant was just as friendly and helpful/knowledgeable when it came to answering my boyfriend's questions about the menu. They checked on us repeatedly throughout the meal, making sure we were happy with the food and drinks, etc. I didn't think they'd do anything else beside wishing him a \"happy birthday,\" but they brought us ice cream with a birthday candle to share. LOL. No wonder Ramon's assistant conveniently forgot to bring us a dessert menu. Thank goodness they don't sing to their patrons! That would've been mortifying! XD Onto actual food and drinks...  We had ordered the Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce that is extremely yummy, especially with the sauce, but really potent when you mix in the pickled onions(?). Then comes the Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli -  breading gives it enough crunch to match the texture of the Portobello and the sauce pairs so well! He couldn't stop eating those, and he was hesitant at first. There was also Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar - wanted more of that, but the boyfriend limited what he shared with me. We both ordered the Rib-eye, cooked differently, and the chefs had made 'em right! Love the char on it, but I love how tender the meat was overall. I didn't really have to struggle cutting through it (that night or as leftovers). Oh my gah... The Salted Caramel Ice Cream they brought out with a candle was amazing! It wasn't overly sweet, and I love the candied peanuts it was topped with. I'm not really a fan of caramel, but that was an impressive find!  After dinner, they didn't rush us to leave or make us feel guilty for taking our time talking more, which I like and appreciate. The cool ending was that the manager wished us a good night and hoped to see us for another celebration. Not gonna lie, but I'm seriously contemplating it for sooner rather than later. Food and service is worth going back here.",

I ordered the carne asada bone marrow, fried spinach salad, and Portobello fries for starters. They were all quite delicious and highly recommend them!   For the entree I ordered their ribeye. I had it cooked medium and it was perfect! You cant beat a 8-10z ribeye steak for about $35 bucks. This is definitely a hidden gem and I suggest everyone visiting vegas to check out Echo and Rig. The plaza where the restaurant is located is also quite nice and I thoroughly enjoyed its ambiance.",

I was a little disappointed with the octopus salad, the octopus was very tough. The curried mussels were ok, would have liked more development of flavor in the broth which is most important with a mussels dish. Overall, meh it was ok. 3/5",

Side dishes were standouts, as always - the heirloom carrots, spicy cauliflower, and garlic mashed potatoes were all perfectly seasoned.  Everyone at the table got a steak. Filet mignon and Hanger steaks came out great as well.  Incredible service as always. Servers know the menu up and down and inside and out. If you describe what you're feeling like eating but don't know exactly what to order, they will quickly tailor a custom order for you. I love that.  Huge fan. The Rat Pack would dig this joint! As good as it gets - and certainly for a steak lovin' town like Vegas!  The *only* thing I might address/change at the restaurant is the super bright fluorescent kitchen lights that make it hard to sit facing the kitchen while seating in the upstairs dining room at night. Not the best setup for great ambience...",

    "text": "First and most likely last time I'll eat here.There were three of us, no reservation, approx. 6:30pm on a Thursday. Location was Easy to find...Ive been to Tivoli Village a million times, and have never noticed this restaurant. That should have been a sign. Haha.  The hostess greets me and I said party of three for dinner please. the only table available (with no reservation) was on the (heated) back  patio. Ok. asked us if we had ever been here, no first time. As we walked up the stairs, it was very loud. She sat us on the patio, very end table right by the door and big heater. Again very loud. We sat there for 10-12 min before anyone spoke to us. Hostess gave us menus so we had something to look at while we waited. Manager was 1st to come to table, ask us how everything was going tonight, and if we needed anything. Which was nice  but, it would've made more sense to ask somebody that was done eating. I figured he would have at least taken our drink order!! But nope... server finally came over and talk so fast& soft, considering how loud it was. We could only  understand every 3 word that came out of his mouth.  The experience Didn't get much better. All 3 of us got the NY strip.  And 3 sides. Food finally came and my medium rare (which should be a little bloody) was over cooked. And very salty, as was all the dishes. And I should have said something but at that point I was tired, and ready to get outta there.  The bill came, and after it was all said and done: experience, quality of food, portions, service; the verdict was this place is  overpriced and needs to take a step back and re learn the basics.",

The steak & eggs though, I don't know if their portions have just shrunk through time but our steak was literally the length & width of my thumb. I mean it is a cheap entree but the photos on Yelp were deceiving. We decided to try an actual steak on their dinner menu and was told that if we normally eat Ribeyes to try the Bavette- supposedly it has some kind of zebra or stripe-like marbling and is more tender. We noticed photos on yelp that this place serves their steaks very charred so I told the bartender I didn't want it charred but it still was. I'm not sure if it is their cooking style but I am not a fan. The temperature was good but the meat was not as tender as they said. Maybe I was served the wrong cut off meat?   Anyway, we had high hopes for this place but it didn't quite meet our expectations. People we met here though were very nice and love the place. They tried hard to sell it though, they even bought us a taco because they wanted us to try the house made sausages in the tacos. This place does have loyal customers- I did like that.",

Both were so yummy and not too saucy or salty which I feel is a common problem at most steak places. I got the ribeye cap medium which couldn't have been cooked any more perfect. It was juicy and tender and practically melted in my mouth. I got the mushroom sauce which was yummy but the steak is so dang good that you don't even need sauce! I love the mushroom and chips that come with. Always great to have a little crunch with your steak! For dessert we got the peanut brittle sundae and the berry shortcake both also so delicious.

    "text": "This place gets a 5 star rating based off of the sheer value. Rest assured, you will not leave this establishment hungry. I was part of a group of 6, and we were going to dinner to celebrate/mourn my departure from Vegas after a month of visitation (my girlfriend lives here, and I'm on break from school). When we were seated we were greeted by one of the managers (I assume) who did an exemplary job of running through just about EVERYTHING on the menu and what her personal recommendations were. In addition, the waitress we had for the rest of the evening (her name was Nina and was such a sweetheart) was very attentive and also very informative in regards to the cuts of steak and special bone-in options that were available. +2 for knowledgeable wait staff.   Our group decided to split 7 appetizers, tapas-style before we each got our steaks. The highlights included Grilled Thick Cut Bacon with Barbecue Sauce, Bone Marrow Carne Asada (beef marrow bone garnished with carne asada, peppers, onions, and crostini...SUPERB), Sweetbreads with pickled cabbage, and Butcher's Sausage, and Portobello fries with herb aioli (pretty much the best fried mushrooms you'll ever have). I'm aware that's pretty much 5 of the 7 appetizers, but they really were all that good.  Then came the steaks. As far as steakhouses go, I'm not very experienced. I got the rib eye with a green peppercorn sauce and though it was good, but not great. This is where the value comes in; the VERY reasonable price (35 dollars for NY strip, filet mignon, and rib eye cuts) makes it extremely hard to complain. My steak was also quite fatty (about 1/3 of the steak was gristle), but that is to be somewhat expected with a cut like rib eye. Sides were also excellent (Garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini). At the end of the meal, we were surprised by a complementary desert  of sea salt caramel ice cream and coffee from our waitress for the occasion. It was definitely appreciated.  Me and my girlfriend got our steaks and all the apps on our bill. Total cost: 152 bucks....not bad at all for a relatively upscale establishment. Totally 5 stars in my book, I would happily go back again.",

    "text": "We've been going off the Strip on our trips to Vegas recently and based on a recommendation we hit Echo & Rig for dinner on Christmas Eve.  It turns out we got a early Christmas present as we had a great meal.  Except for a misidentification of the source of one of the oyster selections, everything was great from appetizer to sundae dessert.    Despite the identification faux pas go ahead and try the oysters they're varied and fresh.  The steaks were prepared perfectly, and we agree with our waiter Brian that the side sauces may be delicious but they are not necessary.  In my case the rib eye was flavorful without being fatty - just the right level of marbling.  And the different sundae options were unique and ours was very tasty.    Service was very attentive.  The wine list and drinks were interesting and I love that sparkling water was offered along with still.    While I wouldn't recommend paying the prices in the butchery on the first floor, it does add an interesting flair to the restaurant.  Best of all, Echo & Rig is very fairly priced versus top high end steak chains and better restaurants on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!",

The portobello fries were amazing and I would say are a must-try.  The restaurant did not have the ribeye cap available that night so I opted for the full ribeye medium rare.  First 2 bites were filled with a piece of gristle which was very disappointing and essentially inedible.  I tried to then work around the steak to a different area to avoid the offensive section - of which the next 3 out of 4 bites were also gristle filled.  At that point, I gave up and shared my concerns with the waiter who was polished, gracious, and professional.  The manager stopped by coincidentally to discuss the wine we were drinking and I shared the dining experience with him which he also received very professionally.  I'd like to return for the professional courteous service and exemplary side dishes.",

It started out a little rough, as we had to wait about 1/2 hour for our table, even though we had a reservation....and this was after a full day of traveling from the East Coast, so I was not a happy camper.  The woman who seated us agreed that we shouldn't have had to wait as long as we did, and she sent the manager, Derek, over.  He could not have been nicer, which we really appreciated, and he immediately had them bring us out an appetizer to apologize for the wait, which was a really nice touch.  Our waitress, Jessica, was a total sweetheart.  Onto the food...spectacular.  We had the calamari, a salad, portobello fries and steaks.  Everything was superb.  Then, because we hadn't done quite enough damage, we ordered a cappuccino ice cream concoction for dessert, which was awesome as well.  Will def. return on our next trip to Vegas.  The food was great & the staff are terrific....great job Derek & Jessica!",

For some reason in Las Vegas, there are very few restaurants where you can sit outside.  They have an upstairs patio that can seat over 50.  And thanks to heaters, you can sit outside in January. Our friends from Switzerland compared the ambiance to Monte Carlo.  Although not cheap, the quality and level of service is superior.  The deserts sound mediocre but are a must.  A local tip:  you may bring whatever wine you want, and there is no corkage fee.    We have kids, and it is their favorite restaurant.  They have a non-published kids menu now.",

When I first walked it, I was a little taken aback because it almost seemed like the interior was unfinished. As we waited to be seated, a server came and offered us a sample of their turkey deli-meat. At first, I was a bit confused, then I noticed that they are also a butcher shop.    The second floor, where the dining room and outdoor patio seating are located is gorgeous. It is a wide open space with a lot of white. It feels very sunny, a perfect ambiance for a Sunday brunch.    The service is always great and we never had to wait for refills or too long for food. Both times I ordered the eggs benedict, which comes pretty traditional except they also add a layer of sauteed spinach, which is a perfect compliment to the dish.  There is a bottomless mimosa, and they are quick to refill you as soon as you reach halfway. I love that they bring you a carafe of OJ so that you can determine yourself how much OJ you want in your mimosa.  This and one other place in town are tied for my favorite Sunday Brunch location.  If you love brunch, Echo and Rig is a MUST.",

I did find the place on YELP when we didn't know where to go when we visited Las Vegas. Made reservations and they seated us after a 10 minute wait. Sat us up next to the kitchen (not happy at first) yet I will be honest and admit that it was not that bad and I did get to see what was going on especially by the man (picture) who ran the kitchen. The waiter was good and friendly and very helpful with suggestions and I will say he was 100% correct on my $100 rib eye (picture) which was cooked perfectly. I had a drink call the \"HOT MESS\" and it was so good I had to have several more. I must also say that even though our waiter was good... the guy who helped out the waiter was a great helper who never once let anything go with out being there to correct the situation, serve us and even helped at end of the dinner... I never give the helper to the waiter but this gentleman was AWESOME and I did let the floor manager (picture) know about his awesome service. The last thing I want to say that the bill was not that bad for a party of 6 and my $100 steak. So if you are looking for a GREAT place to eat a great dinner I do suggest you try this place.",

    "text": "This review is based on two dinner outings.  The first was somewhat better than the second.  On my initial visit, I reveled in an excellent small appetizer plate of Meatballs with mixed flavors and straight ahead red Tomato Sauce and fresh grated Parmesan Cheese brought on request.  French Onion Gratin Soup with caramelized Onion, Roasted Pumpkin Squash, Sage, and domestic Swiss Cheese was great and somewhat unique served in a Staub metal pot.  A side of Butternut Squash & Brown Sugar was also excellent.   Sweet Fire Cauliflower was rather spicy but sweet at the same time.  Mushroom Rockefeller was interesting and tasty.  Garlic Shrimp featured 5 jumbo shrimps.  And, Garlic Chips were light on garlic and very good.   On the first occasion, these were offered to us to savor as snacks while we waited to be seated despite arriving on schedule.  But, on the second, during a delay that lasted about 15 minutes to be seated after the time of our reservation, we were offered nothing.      There was a long wait between consumption of starters and delivery of our entrees during the first dinner service.  When entrees did finally arrive, I enjoyed a medium rare Filet Mignon that was in fact almost rare, with a good Red Wine Demi Glace and excellent Bearnaise Sauce.  This meal ended on a very upbeat note with great moist Strawberry Shortcake and assorted berries along with a Turtle Espresso Sundae provided gratis by the manager to make up for our delayed entrees.  A yummy finish!   Both times after our arrival, the period of waiting to be seated was a little unusual, as my party of four had to stand on our feet and awkwardly mill about with other strangers in the sleek tiled atrium until we were called.  The only diversions were observing butchers at work or looking at cuts of beef, chicken, lamb, and pork, and various sausages in the on site butcher shop that displayed staggering prices for each offered item.  On the second occasion just over three weeks after the first, Wild Mushroom Soup with a touch of cream was even better than the French Onion Gratin Soup experienced earlier.  Complimentary bread was very tasty.  Garlic Shrimp were juicy, tasty, and extra fine.  A Steak Salad with large Cannelini Beans, medium rare hunks of tender beef, pepperoni, White Onions, Red Bell Pepper, pepperoncini, and zucchini was a very good chopped salad, but almost a meal in itself.  And, another 8 oz. medium rare Filet was very tender and buttery (again almost rare), enhanced by a good Green Peppercorn Sauce and again an excellent Bearnaise Sauce.  Moist Skin-on Redskin Mashed Potatoes were very good, just as again were homemade Garlic Chips (if you like potato chips with your steak, which I don't).  The only food item I didn't find appealing on this occasion was a side of too hard, falling apart Brussels Sprouts.  And, a fellow diner announced that she did not like her Shaking Beef entree.  While the food served here both times was generally praiseworthy, the second dinner was marred by a cluster of service errors: one bowl of Wild Mushroom Soup (mine) was missed, and then the server forgot to bring it to the table again; no steak knife was provided until requested; refilling water glasses was very intermittent; Bearnaise Sauce was initially forgotten; and Grilled Seabass was proferred with skin on after the server declared that it would only arrive at the table with skin off, and being told \"Good!\" by the diner who ordered this dish.  My steak was also cold by the time I finished this delayed entree, after dispatching the salad and belated soup courses.  The decor here is modern but rather austere, and feels somewhat cold.  The capacious upstairs dining room can also become very loud when it fills up, as it did both times I was here.  But to me, food is paramount.  Although this restaurant still has a few kinks to work out, it offers much promise.  Based on my two experiences to date, I rate it 4-1/2 stars overall.",

Ok - so the place is gorgeous, the only issue I have is that the open concept allows for some killer accoustics and it gets VERY loud.  That being said, I went for dinner w/ my husband and mother-in-law for her birthday.  We had 5 drinks, 2 apps, 1 steak, 4 sides, 1 entree, and dessert - and our meal w/ tip was only $150.  For a steakhouse w/ exception quality food, that's REALLY reasonable.  For example - a quality draft beer (Innis & Gunn) is only $6.  That's cheaper than Yard House!!  We had a fantastic meal and I would definitely go again (for the veggies out there, the hubs and I ordered the asparagus, the goat cheese sammy - it was massive, and the mac n cheese - it was ALL incredible!).  I also returned once for happy hour - I believe it's every day from 3pm-6pm.  $2 shrimp cocktail, $1 all beef hot dogs, and great drink specials!  Definitely worth a try!",

We were seated within a few minutes of arriving and were blown away the entire time until we left again about 2.5 hours later. The Floor manager *Kevin? had been made aware of the \"birthday celebration\" and came to our table to personally congratulate my husband and banter a little. Great personal touch. We were one of 2 parties seated in the actual dining room, others had been seated on the balcony. Our Waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, cuts of meat, recommendations, and was even honest about things he would not necessarily recommend. This is greatly appreciated as a first time patron! The restrooms were immaculate, and even offered a Hand Scrub at the sink, ooh lala! Everyone, and i mean EVERYONE that we enountered during our visit were professional, friendly, and just treated us like we were the only ones in the room. I hope the restaurant keeps this formula because I can definitely say, it works! I haven't even touched on the actual food!! It was Spectacular!! Husband had the RibEye, I had the Rib Eye Cap, one friend had a fish entree, and the other had a Steak Grilled cheese. Once our food came, our table was absolute silence other than sighs of joy and exclamations at how delicious EVERYTHING was. For sides, we ordered Brussel Sprouts, Mashed potatoes, and Roasted Broccolini. these three were more than enough for the Four of us. Dessert menu is all handcrafted Sundaes, and i highly recommend them as they are not your typical ice cream dish. you'll have to try them for yourselves. Definitely shareable, but we were greedy and had one for ourselves.",

We were able to sit on the second floor patio, and were protected from the slight sprinkling of rain that made dinner all the more enjoyable.   Starters were great, and for a mushroom hater like me, the portobello fries were delicious. I remember saying that this was the only way I would ever eat a mushroom again. And it's still True.   Steak was seasoned and cooked really well, to the delight of my scrutinizing taste buds. The baked mac and cheese was a crowd favorite, and everyone went back for seconds. Potatoes were potatoes. You can't really go wrong there. The sauces were amazing, and brought out the taste of the meat like they're supposed to. You had the usual suspects, the wine sauce, the bearnaise, etc. ALL delicious. P.S. Drop some of those sauces on your potatoes for a potato experience you'll never forget. Also got to try an amigo's roasted chicken and another's salmon, and they did not disappoint. Wine list was appropriate for the restaurant.   Had some dessert and coffee to finish up the meal. It was the True Italian ending we needed.   Service was seamless all night. The bill was about $940 with tip for 11 of us, so do the math on that.   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "3 Stars for the food! We will get to the service later...  Started out with the Mache Salad. o-m-g. it was sooo good. consisting of avocado, mache, celery, roasted chicken, and green onions. And only god knows the recipe to this slad dressing.  then we had a few apps. Favorite- Burrata, English peas, mint and onions. I will make this my personal goal to replicate this dish. it was so light and fresh. sometimes burrata can me on the oily side, not here! it was perfect fluffy. so delish fried calamari- i only had a few bites because of my gluten issue but wow these were amazing.  grilled shrimp and scallop ceviche- this was pretty good as well.  for dinner my boyfriend and I each ordered a different steak. I had the filet and he had the Spencer. I must say, the Spencer won. What an amazing cut of meat. After going 2 years without a bite or red meat Im pretty happy i chose this meal to break my no red meat diet. When i saw this piece of beef melts in your mouth.. im serious. Accompanied with their house chips this dish was pretty outstanding. We also had the horseradish creme to go a long with it. YUM!  And the wine... wow. We had about 6 bottles for the table of the Emblem Cab. This wine went perfect with everything. It was so drinkable.. too drinkable. I highly suggest it.  Im going to keep the \"bad\" short and sweet since the meal itself was so amazing. Jason, our server was a total amateur. My bf and I had to wait to eat anything because he didnt know if there were nuts in anything the table ordered. Since we shared everything family style almost everyone was done with sides/apps/salads before we were able to start eating. It was very frustrating. Next time we come in it will probably be to sit at the bar instead. And when I asked to see the manager (because i actually knew him) Jason said he told him to come over. This ended up not True at all.   Other then that the meal was amazing. I highly recommend this place over any other in Tivoli Village... or Summerlin for that matter.",

After choosing our steak and how we wanted it we chose the sauces. We weren't quiet sure which sauce we would like so the waiter brought a few out to try . I thought that was very nice of him .

Our steaks came out in good time and cooked perfectly. I don't recommend using their sauces, because the meat is delicious.   I visited TWICE within 4 days. If that says anything.

A small selections of entrees (lamb, duck or fish my faves) with a nice choice of sides- many unique takes on old favorites. Sides are sufficient for 2 or more unless you still have a teenage boy's appetite. Service- very nice, attentive without being intrusive.

    "text": "My friend and I decided on a night of lusty looks and gnawing on meat as we took in Echo & Rig for dinner before heading over to the Suncoast to see the new Scarlett Johansson feature \"Under the Skin\"   While waiting for my friend I took a seat at the bar where I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered the full menu.   Since we were on a limited amount of time (heaven forbid I miss any minutes of ScarJo action) I decided our best bet was to just eat there, and it also allowed us to partake in the final moments of happy hour.     Unfortunately and probably due to a mixture of too much Jack Daniels and just the right amount of ScarJo intake during the evening I don't recall our bartender's name. But he was friendly, engaging, and got our refills and food orders put in with perfect timing.   I heard him make some recommendations on food items to some other patrons, but I didn't need those as I'm a Yelper who does his research and generally knows what he wants to order before ever sitting down at a restaurant.  Here's what we went with (everything was shared)  1.  Fried Spinach Salad:   This reminded me so much of one of my favorite eats ever, Toro with Crispy Spinach from Izakaya by Katsuya in Los Angeles.  The spinach is melt in your mouth with a great flavor.   A must order  2.  Salt and Pepper Fries:  I would have normally gone with the Yelp favorite Portobello fries, but I thought my dining companion would enjoy these more based on her tastes.  Perfectly cooked, but perhaps not enough pepper to really stand out as anything other than a batch of decent salted french fries you can get all over town  3.  Brussel Sprouts:  The Yonaka effect.  Ever since Yonaka's version anytime I see these on any menu I want to try them.   These were tasty.   Perfectly grilled with lemon and pistachios.     4.  Then came the star of the show, the Filet Mignon which is billed as \"Double R Ranch Sustainable Beef\".   It came with a Green Peppercorn sauce on the side which we chose, but honestly it might as well not have come with that at all.   We both took a bite of the meat with the sauce and enjoyed it, but then ate the rest of it without ever putting anymore sauce on it.   I tend to think beef stands on it's own and only needs the slightest of seasoning to make it perfect, and this was a shining example of that.     All in all our bill came out to roughly $80 and was worth every penny.   Now I anxiously await a new Mila Kunis or Natalie Portman feature to be exclusively playing at the Suncoast so I can do it all over again.",

I highly recommend the Portobello Fries...even if you are not a mushroom fan, these simply melt in your mouth.  For the main meal, we had the Roasted Chicken and Tomahawk Chop. WOW WOW WOW...you might think chicken is boring, but without trying to sound cliche, this was literally the most delicious piece of chicken I have ever had. The Tomahawk Chop looked very rare, but it was sooooo tender and delicious. Please do not eat this with steak sauce...it is meant to be enjoyed as is!  The only disappointment was the dessert. While it wasn't bad (how can dessert be bad??), it just didn't have that WOW factor. But hey, this is a chophouse...so enjoy the meat!  One of the best meals I've ever had.

When the staff realized their mistake and informed our server he simply said \"oh let's just swap them out\" and reached over to grab the plates from the couple (one plate was already being eaten) and he proceeded to place the plates in front of my husband and I, like saying problem solved. Didn't even ask if we were fine with that or cared that one plate had already been cut into. It wasn't until our friend that had been given the plate by accident said she already cut into it and we should get new plates. They gave my husband (the birthday boy!!) the \"clean\" plate which was already cold. They did bring out a new steak after a while but only after our guest said we deserve a new steak. The way they handled the error was very tacky for such an \"upscale restaurant\". Aside from that, other guests from our party felt their food was bland. Then it came time to pay. We waited about 20 minutes for our check. And another 10-15 minutes for them to process them plus there were errors on a few bills, just a very frustrating process. Overall, we were disappointed with the service which for me put a damper on enjoying the food.",

Even better was the service. I had left my credit card there and by the time I realized I had already boarded a plane for home. Felicia, who is just totally awesome tracked it down and mailed me card in NYC.  Major thanks to her!",

However they dropped the ball on what I think is the MOST IMPORTANT part of going to a steak place...the steak experience! Like most, I prefer a steak with a glass of red wine. The waiter took my order for a refill of my wine a few minutes before the steak had arrived. I was thinking I'd get the wine fairly soon. (I did not). So I began eating the steak which was good (the ribeye) but didn't fully enjoy it since my wine came out 20 minutes later. So instead I \"enjoyed\" a cold steak with wine. Having been to places like Cut, Delmonico's and Maestros, I can't say this place is in the same league whatsoever.",

The summer salad with skirt steak scored big with me.  The filet was great to my little ones.  The fish was not their specialty, so stay away from fish.  The portabella mushroom was awesome.  The rib eye was also good when they prepared the meat the way we wanted.  One time, the steak was burned.  My friends liked the octopus salad appetizer.   I dont mind coming bck there again.  The service was excellent, staff was always attentive.  The decor and atmostphere was like in  high end restayrant, but pricing was in the middle range.  Guess that earned one extra star.",

    "text": "Great reviews from everyone else but I was disappointed.   What happened? Well for one was bad service.  To begin with our waiter Sam was great! He was right over to greet us, bring our drinks and inform us of the steak choices.  For the rest of the evening, we didn't see him until he brought dessert menus.  Usually I like to be checked on during the meal. Several others came to our table to refill drinks or bring the meals.  Sam was no where to be seen.  We had to ask another waiter to find ours so we could get the bill.  Very unfortunate.    For my meal, I ordered the Alaskan Cod. Our table chose to share the sides of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar along with Mac & Cheese.  The cod was very very small.  The flavor was ok but could've been better.  I realize it is a steakhouse but I've had much better.  The potatoes did not have any garlic or cheddar flavor in them.  It was the first time I've had to salt and pepper potatoes at a restaurant.  I will say the Mac and Cheese was really creamy and delicious.    This dining experience was less than average all around.  I was really hoping for excellent since we made a special trip to dine with them.",

It's always a pleasure to see him and we always look forward to the next time. Ramone is such an asset to this establishment. His professionalism, sense of humor and knowledge makes our evening even more enjoyable. He knows our tastes so well and we trust all of his recommendations.

For appetizers, we had Bone Marrow, mushroom fries (amazing), and short rib grilled cheese.   For entrees 2 of us had fish (lacking flavor), several steaks (small and not what they sounded like in the description, fancy BLT sandwich and a burger.

The food is amazing and I definitely recommend the Short Rib Hash, Eggs Benedict, and the Portobello Mushroom Fries.   The Short Rib in the hash is super tender, the eggs were perfectly cooked so yolk smothered this meal once I cut into it, and finally, the potatoes are cubed very small, perfectly made for eating with a spoon. If this is your first time here, get this dish you won't be let down.   I'm huge Portobello Mushroom fan and Echo and Rig has the mushroom game on lock. Sliced Portobello mushrooms that are tempura fried and served with an herbaceous aioli. Fantastic flavor combo!   To top it off, the bottomless mimosa's never come close to touching the bottom of my glass. Fast and friendly service all day! -  Go eat!",

He also gave us some local tips about restaurants and casinos around town.   Of course we ordered too much food! Pork belly slaw- wow, great acid, perfectly fall apart.  Steak tartare-nicely seasoned Bone marrow- comes with extra \"carne\" and onions to mix with. Good flavor - personally, I'm over bone marrow but this was a good portion.  Portobello fries- I was against the thought of these, but Ari brought some out for us to try because we had to and they were, surprisingly, delicious. I could dip everything in that basil aioli.  Rib eye-cooked a little more rare than medium rare but really flavorful.  Mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and asparagus- good sides, but I was so full at this point Chocolate cherry sundae-they only do sundaes here and this one did not disappoint. Not a dessert person but the dehydrated candied walnuts were amazing. I'm going to try to duplicate these at home!  All in all, a great steakhouse off the strip. they love  what they are doing and it really shows through the entire staff we encountered.",

I've never eaten that much food in one sitting but I was tempted to order another cauliflower plate . The basil aioli served with the portobello fries was amazing .   We order three cuts of steak. Nick brought the meat presentation and it was all over . We ordered the 50oz tomahawk steak. It was heavenly! Seriously best steak I've ever eaten . I also ordered the Ribeye cap steak. It was perfectly cooked and so delicious . I had a bite of the Spencer cut steak as well and it was tasty.   This restaurant is amazing . I left in love and will definitely return. They even did something to acknowledge the birthday in our party .",

Our server kindly corked and let it breathe so that it would be just right!   We'd never been here so we took forever to figure out what to order, but everything we ordered was spot on!!! Family style is always my preferred way at a new restaurant so that we can try as many dishes as possible.   Spinach salad was lightly fried and amazingly delicious!  Fried egg asparagus- because we need our green food!   Lamb chop porterhouse- comes with two pieces nicely charred and not too chewy, how lamb could be  We ordered off the raw steak tray which is for cuts 25oz and up at $2.49 an ounce. The New York was the smallest on the tray and we went for it! If you're going to order from the tray tell the server that first so that time is allotted to cook. They served it pre sliced with house chips. Perfect for sharing.   We stopped at the bar downstairs for a quick shot before we got the night started. To my surprise they had rum chatta! So of course I ordered us Cinnamon Toast Crunch shots!!! Delicious!!!",

    "text": "I'm on the fence about this place.  My first visit, our little group of 3 got seated immediately at around 9pm on a Friday.  We ordered a few appetizers and ribeyes off the menu.  Stand out appetizer was the portobello fries, as many other reviewers attest.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, cut like butter, and tasted great.  The next time I went alone with the husband.  We arrived around 8:15 on a Saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes, which was fine.  Wait staff was quick to get our drink orders.  This time we decided to take the advice of others and selected a bone-in rib eye to share. Appetizers came out quickly, but our steak took near 45 minutes to make its way from the kitchen.  Apparently, our expectation that a steakhouse should never mess up steaks was asking too much.  We asked for medium rare and got well done instead.  For whatever reason, I don't like to send food back.  We ate a few bites, and even at well done, it wasn't bad, which is a testament to their cuts, but our ribeye's pre-cooked weight was 26oz and cost ~$2.50/oz ($65).  I couldn't sit still for a $65 piece of meat, so we called our waiter over.  He saw our plate, instantly recognized that our meat was overcooked, and called the manager to come over.  While we were waiting, the couple next to us sent back their salmon for the same problem.  The waiter's reaction seemed to indicate that this was happening all night long.    The manager was professional about the situation.  He told us that he would comp the steak and asked if we would like another.  We were already running late for a movie, so we opted for just the comp.   We ended up missing the movie.  Although the manager handled the overcooked steak in a most appropriate way, I do think it is a sin for the kitchen staff to mess up, what seemed to be, multiple orders.  It's a relatively new restaurant, so I'll give them one more chance, but if they screw up steak again, there is no way I could recommend this place to anyone.",

I literally had to wave my hands to get the other bartenders attention. I told him my juice was in a dirty glass..He looked at it and started to pour it in a clean glass. How gross is that, When I said tell me your really not doing that, He said what's wrong with that. My husband and I walked away and told the hostess to please seat us. After we were seated we told our waitress and she said the hostess made her aware of the problem, but that she was not surprised at all:(  We went on to have great food and great service. our waitress said management was aware of what happened but neither manager spoke with us our waitress apologized for the dirty bartender. I thought that was odd . In a upscale place like this, there bartenders should be better trained they could learn something from the waiters and waitresses. steer clear of the bar:(",

Next time, I brought a friend and decided to try some pasta dish. It SUCKED. In fact they burnt the pasta and it had to go back. This is after I waited 45 minutes for the dish.   What this has going for it is very good quality meats. The downside is the INCONSISTENCY. Some of the waiters and bartenders are good, and others horrible.   Last time I sat down at the bar, hungry and thirsty after a long day, the c*nt bartender ignored me because gossiping with a waitress was more important for her. When a customer comes in, your job is to give them a menu and take a drink order ASAP. Get it?   This is not a place I would consider for any important date or business dinner again.  They have a good idea, but execution is clearly a problem here.   I have a suggestion for management: you are a f*cking steak house. So hire some REAL waiters. Not bimbos based on looks. And get your kitchen in order. Try to be a real steakhouse like Peter Luger etc. You have the potential, and this town needs it.",

    "text": "It was yelp family night checking out new spot although for Suzy H already been but thankfully had someone too guide us. Mahalos! The best thing about eating with yelpers is its buffet of food samples on table. Yay!! Between the four of us ordered bunch of apps too start just about ran out of room for my pasta course. It would take too long too mention all the apps but the bone marrow app was amazing (loved the fact something that hardly see on any restaurants menu, the bone marrow cooked perfection spread it like butter on the bread came with or straight up bone marrow heaven on spoon), oyster slider (mini po boy), portabello fries (truly all its HYPED too be! It nice crispy on the outside and the aioli comes with its tasty more so order more till the last fries), mac and cheese (another solid solid dish), and forgot order bunch more stuff. Those things stood for me.   My entree order the bolognese. Honest all the things I tried it was average. I know asked for it not getting STEAK the thing most known or trademark dish. I not in steak mood. The process if you where too order one is pretty interesting. They literally show you the cut of meat that going too cook for you on really nice sliver platter and ALSO literally butchered that day or hell if I know maybe that minute. In the front of the restaurant they have open butcher shop that can see all the cuts of meat. One of the things known for is fact they get in whole carcass and break everything down. No joke it comes too getting fresh cut of meat here at Echo and RIg. Maybe the next time I come in will get my steak onnnn.  The service was good. Although sharing long family style table with another group of four seem odd too me. The hostess told us before and had no problems with the idea. Not sure great way too get repeat customers knowing another party literally on the same table. They had our servers all out of whack thinking which side of the community table does this go too.  It interesting that the restaurant is upstairs but yet the bar is located downstairs/butcher shop. I love the fact they have little patio area on the first floor and second floor. It great place too people walking around trivolli village. It pricey but could be lot worst if you went steakhouse on the strip. If looking for high end steakhouse not on the strip Echo & Rig is awesome spot! Now only if I could afford too eat like this everyday. Dam it.",

    "text": "I usually will wait until a 2nd visit to review a place, however if the place is really bad or amazingly good I'll write a review when I get home from the place. This is one of those reviews.  I don't often make it up to Tivoli Village but on the trips I did I would always peek in the windows and see how things were going at Echo & Rig. Tonight I finally got into the place and it was great.  When we entered they walked us through the lower level, we got to check out the butcher shop, the deli/charcuterie counter, and the bar before heading upstairs to the dining room.  The layout is a little random with the bar/butcher shop downstairs, and the dining room & kitchen upstairs. The dining room is very open and there's some room between the tables. There is a patio off the dining room and an exhibition kitchen along the entire south wall of the dining room.  The servers were attentive, the hosts were friendly, the bussers were quick to refill the water glasses (complimentary sparkling or still water), and bringing the proper weapons(utensils) to make sure we could properly enjoy our meals.  The food was really, really damn good. We had several things off of their expansive (Over 90 item) Menu. The hardest part of the entire meal was selecting which items on the menu to try and which to keep for another visit.  The meal started with a bread basket, it was a pretty basic looking basket with 3 slices of bread and no butter, at first I thought it was odd, but after trying the bread I realized butter wasn't needed.  Next up was our small plate \"appetizers\". First up was the Thick Cut Bacon and BBQ Sauce. The Bacon was grilled which added a great flavor, the BBQ sauce was ok, but I mainly ate the bacon plain and it was good. We also had the Bone Marrow Carne Asada, yes you read that right it's not only \"Gods Butter\" Bone Marrow it also comes with carne asada as well a perfect combo on the toast.  After that was the Charcuterie Plate, Prosciutto, 3 different Salamis, Pate, and Head Cheese all were delish, but the Prosciutto was my favorite.  Next was Grilled Octopus, now I myself am not an octopus guy, but this dish was amazing and made me rethink my hatred for octopus. We also had the Mushroom soup, it was creamy and delish.  Next was the Entree Course, I had the Butcher's Cut Ribeye which was a 14oz steak cooked medium rare (possibly a touch over), served with Garlic Chips and Mushroom Rockefeller. This would have been enough on it's own, but not for us. We also added Portobello Fries, Mashed Potatoes, and Heirloom Carrots for bonus eats. The Potatoes and Carrots were amazing, but the Steak was the stand out item of the meal. I'm not a fan of steak sauces, but if you are, unlike most places that charge $5-7 for a sauce, Echo & Rig includes one free sauce with your steak, which is a nice touch.  As if all this food wasn't enough the waiter told us about the dessert menu. They  only serve Ice Cream Sundaes. And after hearing him say \"salted caramel ice cream\" I was getting the turtle sundae. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal.  I can't wait to get back and try the rest of their menu. I really am looking forward to their late night menu for a late bite before heading to La Casa down the road for the a Cigar.  Also the have free wifi for all your food porn posting needs which is a great added bonus",

    "text": "Echo & Rig is a priceless undiscovered gem in the gold city for food that is Las Vegas.  Food  5/5 The food here is fantastic with everything well seasoned and super flavorful.   We had : * Rainbow salad 5 flavorful * Watermelon cucumber salad 5 * Spencer 4.5 cooked perfectly great mushroom sauce * Caramel ice cream 5  Service 5/5 To say service is a 5 of possible 5 is an understatement.  The service in this restaurant is leaps and bounds of what one would expect at this price point. During my stays over the last 20 years in Vegas, I have visited dozens of high end expensive restaurants and this is by far the best experience I've had.  Some highlights:  * Everyone was acutely aware it was our first visit - It REALLY mattered to them. * Communication was high between the wait team and with us as well. * Full court press was in full swing - everyone was REALLY working to impress * Teamwork was excellent: waiters working together in a way I hadn't seen before. * Warm and friendly by everyone.   * Structured system in kitchen w pass & Quality checks. * Wait team anticipated needs and was ahead of it before I even asked. * Energetic everywhere - Lots of synergy in the dining area * They remembered my special request from my Open Table reservation which most of the time gets forgotten.  * Manager was very active with handshakes hello and goodbye along with some really nice conversation.  Value 5/5 Our bill was about $105 which if you are used to the Las Vegas strip is a deal and a half.   I've had way worse experiences for double the price.  That included drinks and dessert.  Ambiance 4.5/5. Nice vibe; attractively lit; big windows.  Cleanliness 5/5 Chefs all wore hats in the open and visible kitchen. Clean eating area.  Restrooms 5/5 Perfectly clean.  Attractive. Smelled good. Moisturizing butter rocks left my hands clean moist and smelling great  Parking 2.5 The garage for the shopping center that this establishment is in is awkward but that is of no fault of the restaurant.  Overall 5/5 I take my \"5 star\" ratings seriously (as you can see by the spread on my profile) and in this case a 5 is a slam dunk.  All things said, this is probably the best dining experience I've ever had. It wasn't just the food that was a winner.  The service exceeded my expectations and was in the \"stunning\" category.  There is no doubt I will return to this place on my next visit to Vegas.  You should too.  it's worth the 30 minute excursion.",

When family and friends are in town this is a MUST for dinner (per their request) once you've tried this place it's easy to see why. I've been a GM for a chain of restaurants in town and even taken my CEO and COO here several times.  Some of our favorites are the rib eye cap, the butterfish is amazing! Can't go wrong with the filet. Even the Blt is to die for. Portobello mushroom fries, bbq bacon, ahi poke is fresh! There's not anything I've had here that wasn't truly a winner.  We try to stay away from the strip and we love this tucked away gem. They always make you feel important and you'll never leave hungry. Can't wait for dinner. We'll be there again tonight!",

While the waiters/bartenders were nice, they certainly were not stellar in terms of service. Hardly saw them. The avo toast was good, but needed salt. Cauliflower was good, but not great. Steak was ordered medium, came out rare and food was warm, at best. I will say the beef was high quality and tasty. All in all, worth a go, but my experience did not match their current star rating.

It wasn't until later that we got food poisoning from it that we had to think twice about this place. It was terrible and it ruined our weekend. It took awhile to get the matter resolved but ultimately seemed like they really cared about my experience and gave me credit back to my account and invited me in to eat again. So updates will be needed later on. But aside from the side effects the food was great recommend getting the skirt steak in medium and spencer medium rare. Get the onion sauce for your steak. Also the portobello fries are a must if you like mushrooms the dip for it is unique and great too. Also if it's a nice day try to request a seat on the balcony!",

He gave us some new recommendations on what to try and did not disappoint.  The manager came over and wished me a happy birthday, which was nice.  Brought our 17 year old daughter with us and she LOVED everything.  Will be back again and hopefully soon.",

The waiters were attentive and quick for any service.  The price is a little higher than you're usual steakhouses, i.e, Outback.  Located in the Tivoli center, across from the Suncoast hotel, it's not overrun with tourists and kids in strollers. That's not a bad thing, but away from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip, it's a nice locals place for steaks and drinks. Will definitely go there again soon.",

    "text": "Brought a family of 14 + infant to Echo and Rig. Definitely don't regret it! Worth the drive out from the strip. The overall value: price, quality, service would be great anywhere.   The parking can be a bit far but they have valet and actually seems to have plenty of parking on a Sunday night. Well lit and designed exterior of the entire complex as well as interior of the restaurant. We didn't dress business casual but it sure felt like we should have!   You don't have to worry about selection either. There are a wide range of foods and of course be ready to eat their cuts of steak! I had their bone marrow carne asada and portobello mushroom fries, both of which I wasn't sure what to expect but you should expect deliciousness! We also shared the calamari, vegetable appetizer, and mushroom soup. One thing that wasn't to my liking was the mushroom soup. I felt it could have been thicker with more rich flavor, but to each their own.  I had the filet mignon cooked medium with mushroom sauce and their home cooked potato chips. I would have preferred a different side because the consensus seemed to not favor those too much. I felt they could have been more crispier with maybe a different oil. That's just my preference.  One very nice thing was that the server noticed my wife was gone and helped to keep her food warm while she was gone. No utensils given when taken to go :( Didn't ask though.   Would definitely come again to another location and recommend coming here. Again, the whole experience does validate their overall 4.5 star rating.",

    "text": "I fell in love with this place immediately after my 1st visit.  It's a beautiful place, with wonderful food and astounding service!!! A perfect spot for an occasion.   We made reservations ( highly recommend) for 4 pm on a Saturday. We arrived 10 min before and we were asked to wait while the got our table ready. We waited in the Butcher Shop and perused the cuts of meats that they offered. Everything looked so enticing!   Our table was ready and the hostess took us up the stairs to our table. The dining room is stunning! They even have outdoor seating, which I personally prefer, but it was a chilly Vegas night, so inside was perfect.   They brought out bread, butter and water and said our server would be right with us. Hugo introduced himself as our server, asked us if we've been there before and asked if we needed him to go over the menu. He was very knowledgeable if everything that was on the menu and that's how it should be.   As a starter we ordered the Arugula Steak salad and we split that into 2. My husband and I were taken back as how good the salad was. We have officially claimed is as one of the top 5 salads we've ever had. My husband ordered the Santa Maria Tri Tip with a Lemon Chimichurri sauce, to be cooked Medium Well and I ordered the Spencer Steak with the Brandied Mushroom sauce, was to be cooked the same. These steaks were so juicy and tender. The knife would cut thru the steak as it was going thru butter!!! These steaks were definitely cooked to perfection. Now if you're not in the mood for steak... let me recommend the Grilled Cheese Sandwich!!! Yes, I know, a grilled cheese sandwich at a steakhouse? Y'all this isn't an ordinary grilled cheese! This sandwich is made with short ribs, gruyere, parmesan & white cheddar. We ordered it and my husband and I split it.. because we ordered a lot of food, I ended up taking it home and eating it afterwards. It tasted fantastic when it came out fresh and the taste stayed the same even when I reheated it.   Over all it was a very pleasant dinning experience. From the beginning all the way till the end, I would rate it a 10/10.",

At lunch they have smaller plates available for some items, salads, soups, and lots of great entrees to pick from.  The entry way has the hostess stand and bar.  They also have a butcher and cases of different cuts of meat available.  Fascinating to see what's in the cases!  Service is impeccable and I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "Definitely one of my top 10 favorite steakhouses in Vegas. It may be a far ways off the strip and the southwest but it's worth the drive for me every time. Echo & Rig is located in Tivoli Village off of 95 & Rampart/Fort Apache. Service is always EXCELLENT every time we go here. I suggest you make reservations well in advance bc they do get pretty busy. If you're having trouble like we did trying to book a reservation online or on OpenTable try calling them. They tend to accommodate us every time we call.   Came here this past weekend for a friend's birthday birthday dinner. Party of 11. Everything we ordered was pretty good. Believe most of the table ordered the Ribeye Cap for their main entree  Ribeye Cap x10 - Excellent. Definitely he best part of the ribeye. Inside was a perfect med rare but our only compliant on most of them was the over char they had going on. Served with kettle chips and a garlic mushroom   White fish? - ok. Server recommended a white fish that wasn't the sea bass that was on the menu. Went with his recommendation but I should've gotten the sea bass instead. Believe it pan seared but dry and bland. A little salt goes a long way. Served with parsnips. I wouldn't recommend this dish (It was the fish dish above the sea bass)  Beef Tartar - delicious. One of my favorites.   Portabella Fries - good served with a yummy pesto like sauce  Calamari - good  Crispy spinach salad - great loved the crispy texture and dressing   Caesar salad - good  Pork belly appetizer - great. Perfectly seasoned and cooked  Cauliflower - good   Mac&Cheese - good  Fruit sorbet - good and refreshing   Salted caramel ice cream - delish  My go to place for a really good affordable steak and drinks. So many good appetizers on their menu and I just love coming back to try them all. This place will definitely not disappoint you. Always leave here satisfied. Don't forget to make reservations in advance. You won't want to miss your chance of eating here bc it's booked out.   P.S. You MUST use their salt hand scrub in the restrooms!! It's the best thing ever! Leaves your hands feeling super soft and smelling awesome. If you love it they sell it by the bottle. Ask your server lol",

With the hash--the short rib was tender, the potatoes were crispy, and overall, it was pretty flavorful. The scramble tasted like something I could [and do] make pretty easily. There wasn't anything special to it.  The reason for 3 stars is because the scramble was very average, and the service was poor. The kitchen was slow, but our waiter was slower. He rarely checked on us and was slow to bring out requested items. The busboy was more on top of his game, for sure. I would give the hash 4 stars.",

Go early enough where you can browse the 'butcher shop' and have a drink downstairs AND don't forget to grab some of the amazing cuts or definitely grab a pound or two of the awesome bacon to take home.  Great atmosphere  When you head up for dinner (sit outside of you can) the patio is beautiful and you don't feel like you're on Vegas.  The appetizers I love are the burnt pork ends, the steak tartare and freak shucked oysters...  The servers will explain the cuts of meat to you and even though you think you know what you want, the presentation makes me change my mind every time.  This is definitely a must for great steaks and really laid back atmosphere.  Thanks to the entire staff... Another home run!",

Bottomless mimosas for $16 and they have a variety of juices including white cran, pineapple, grapefruit, etc. Get the white cranberry, tastes like Capri sun.  Food wise, I always get their avocado toast. It comes with shishito peppers and is spread with creme fraiche. The brunch entrees are okay as well nothing too special there (Benedict's, short rib hash, etc.)   They're not stingy with the champagne either. Don't get rowdy thought cause the lady manager is quick to cut you off.   Make sure you use the scrub in the bathroom, it will change your life. I think they sell it downstairs.",

I sat at the bar to watch Thursday night NFL, have a drink or two and enjoy a good steak.  Here is my rundown:  DRINKS: I only had beer, but they had a few locals on tap which I love. The $3 pints at Happy Hour is a steal. The drinks leaving the bar for the restaurant looked good for what that's worth.   FOOD: My salad was average. I had the kale salad. Expensive at $12, but fresh and no complaints. The rib eye cap was a little more jab the medium-rare I requested, but it was good and the brandy mushroom sauce was solid. The Brussels sprout side was way too salty and otherwise a little boring. I'd go with something else next time.   SERVICE: The bartenders were awesome. Friendly. Knowledgeable. No attitude when I took my time and enjoyed my meal while watching the game. This is what made this place better than a Morton's or a Ruth Chris.",

    "text": "We chose this as our dinner spot for our 14 year wedding anniversary. What an amazing choice!! We were greeted by Augustin and Nicholas. Augustin was an AWESOME waiter! We started with a Maryland Crab Cake and some Wild Mushroom Soup. Both were exquisite! The wife said it was the best crab cake she'd ever had and the depth of flavor in the soup was unreal.   For our main course we chose the bone-in tomahawk steak (37oz) to share and the garlic mashed potatoes as well as the brussel sprouts with pistachios and lemon. The steak came with 6 sauces, 2 stuffed mushroom caps and bowl of homemade garlic chips.  We loved all of the sauces but the mushroom sauce and the bearnaise sauce were our favorites. Both of our sides were amazing and didn't disappoint.   Finally, when we could eat no more, they surprised us with a carmel turtle sundae for our anniversary!  What an amazing experience! We can't wait to go back and try some lunch options!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here. The chopped salad was nicely done with crunchy vegetables and a mild dressing- great in our opinion. We also had two large steaks a t-bone and ribeye along with a side of octopus and shrimp and fries. Took some left-overs with us, as we knew we ordered a lot. Our server was Luke who really did an awesome job explaining the menu and giving recommendations. I ordered carrots as a side that were a bit charred and over cooked but didn't want to complain about that. My mojito was good with blackberries muddled in. There was a little constructive things I noticed and wanted to share. One was the lighting in the bathroom is too bright (maybe lower lighting a tad) and there was a leak in the faucet wasting water. Maybe a few pictures could be added to give a softer feel for ambiance too in the upstairs seating area. Overall, It is a nice spot for eating with outdoor seating as well. We will come back and try it again.",

Right when you walk in, you see the butcher shop to the right, oyster bar in front, and a large bar area to the left with a staircase in the middle taking you up to the main dining area. A very boutique, modern ambiance.  The service was amazing, starting from the hostess to the very attentive waiting staff. Food was awesome. We got the portobello fries, which were lightly battered, still had great taste, juicy mushrooms. I've had these at Bottega Louie and feel like Echo & Rig do these much better! I also got the flat iron sandwich. The steak was perfectly prepared, very tender and full of flavor.  Overall, very impressed. It's about 10 minutes from the strip, but well worth the venture!",

Not sure we have been to a place with such an attentive staff! It started with a very polite Hostess, then one of the floor Managers, Celine approached our table and welcomed us, she was very nice and very professional. Then we met our waiter, Luke, this guy should give classes on how to provide outstanding service, he was very knowledgeable and what really stood out to me is that he didn't try to sell us on the most expensive items on the menu. Luke came across very Honest and sincere, and he was absolutely right.  We ordered the portobello fries and calamari to start. The basil aioli is so delicious and we could not get over the great flavor of the portobello fries. We ordered the cowboy skirt steak and the roasted chicken sandwich in addition to the mashed potatoes and cauliflower. The cauliflower was delicious and had a great balance of sweet, salty and spicy. Our drinks were always topped off and the service by all was outstanding.  Can't wait to have another \" Date Night\" with my wife and once again enjoy the wonderful food and atmosphere at echo & Rig.",

Every visit I've had a manager stop by the table to ask how everything was. Not to mention my boyfriend proposed here with help from the staff which was nice. It was really special how they accommodated his request and my family surprising us. I highly recommend the skirt steak, which is usually a cut of beef I'm not a fan of. Every server has recommended this to me and I never felt like trying it. So happy I did because it is one of the most delicious steaks I've ever had. Their bacon with BBQ sauce is so amazing, the only downside is it does not come with a huge portion. We usually get a side of mashed potatoes which is very creamy and flavorful. Highly recommend this place!",

I've been here several times now for brunch, and their unlimited mimosas deal is amazing. I love that unlike most places that offer bottomless mimosas, Echo & Rig gives you several different juices, not just the traditional orange. My favorite is the pineapple juice with the champagne. Yum! Their brunch food menu is also pretty great, they have a really nice variety and almost everything I've tried is delicious.   PS- If you have room for dessert, get the Cappuccino sundae!

    "text": "I am a local and loyal Las Vegas resident.  I love my city therefore try to give all restaurants in Las Vegas at least 2 or 3 dining experiences before I make a judgement call.  That being said Echo and Rig is THE WORST .  I have dined here more than 5 times (usually by the other couple or guests making the reservation) with each experience being worse than the past one.  Friday was my last time.  Let's talk about the service first. It's a Friday night of a 3 day weekend so you would think Echo and Rig would be prepared for the long weekend.  Not so.  We order drinks after we have been seated.  After about a good 25 mins, the waiter, Nick, brings 2 of the 4 drinks.  The men had ordered scotch with a large cube of ice.  He tells us they are out of large cubes already and they are out of that particular brand of scotch.  (Its 6:30 pm and Glenfiddich was the scotch) The guys order another brand and they wait ANOTHER 20 mins for that scotch to arrive.  (you simply pour some scotch in a glass . There is no mixing).  As you can now guess, the other lady and myself are almost finished with our drinks.   Fast forward.  We order soup and salad .  I had the mushroom soup . It was ok.  Nothing either here or there.  My husband orders the Caesar salad which was so soggy from sitting in its dressing that it looked wet.  He barely ate the salad.  We also tried the portabella fries which were slightly cold but do have a nice flavor.  After the soup and salad course, we order another round of drinks prior to dinner being served as to enjoy the wine with dinner .  AGAIN, literally pour the wine in a glass and serve it .  Nothing fancy or mixed.   Dinner comes.  One steak, 2 fish dishes and I have linguine and clams.  The steak was under cooked and served looking horrid.  It tasted just ok but was so chewy it ruined the desire for a quality piece of meat.  Echo and Rig is a steak house btw.   The fish dishes , salmon and the sea bass were prepared nicely and our friends said they tasted good.  My dish the linguine and clams had so much garlic in it that when it was placed on the table, all of us said \" Wow that is strong\".  The stench of the garlic was overwhelming.  I go ahead and try the dish anyway.  The garlic was so heavy, I could not eat it.  No white wine or clam flavor at all just garlic.  Huge chunks of garlic.  To the point of burning your mouth slightly from the garlic taste.   I called the manager over and politely told her this dish was not able to be eaten.  She took it away.  At this point, I have no meal and everyone else is about done with their meals and guess what?? Our drinks come .  That's right , the whole time we had 3 of the 4 dinners, we had no wine.  Ridiculous.   We asked for a check. Decided we didn't need any dessert.  No one apologized for the service or the meal.  No one offered anything like a dessert or after dinner drink.  The manager didn't even apologize.  Nick just said we took the linguine off since it was not to your liking.  It was a terrible experience from beginning to end.   Just to share that we were not the only ones, we ran into 2 separate groups of friends on the way out.  One group of 4 had been waiting for 45 mins for their reservation that still wasn't ready.   The second group had a worse experience then we did.  They got there at 7 pm brought their own bottle of wine. The manager opened it (for a charge of course) dropped the bottle, it broke all over the floor and the guests.  Echo and Rig \"gave\" them another bottle which was about 100 dollars less in value than the one they brought in.  Offered them no discount.   The waiter never  brought them their oysters and after being asked twice for said oysters, they came 45 mins later with no forks, napkins or lemon.   They finally walked out about 945 being fed up with the horrid service and the waiter ran after them with the full bill.  Not even the wine corkage fee removed .   Truly, I could go on and on.  Suffice it to say DO NOT DINE HERE.  You will regret giving them your money, you will not have had an enjoyable meal and in my case you will be hungry.    No where near the standards of so many great steak houses in Las Vegas.  Thanks for reading !!!!",

    "text": "Wow! I heard good things about Echo & Rig and this definitely lived up to my expectations. My husband was right when he said we should have eaten here sooner.  I really enjoy a good steak so we typically eat at steakhouses on the Strip and that is really my main comparison. How does Echo & Rig compare to steakhouses on the Strip? The food is at least as good, service is possibly better, and the atmosphere/dress is much more casual. The pricing is shockingly reasonable considering the top notch service and quality of the food.  The first floor is actually the butcher shop where meats are available to purchase and take home. The restaurant is upstairs with a large indoor dining room and an outdoor patio overlooking Tivoli. The decor is clean and minimal. The atmosphere is very laid back, it's not a steakhouse where you have to get really dressed up. We even saw a few tables with children.   Our waiter and the entire staff were on their game. Everyone was very attentive. We didn't have a long wait between courses, every food item was explained upon arrival, waters were constantly refilled, and any crumb on the table was removed immediately.   We started with two cocktails that were both delicious. After ordering I noticed that they even offer half glasses of wine. I would probably take advantage of that option next time since I'm not a huge drinker. Our appetizer of choice was the Lamb Cigars, my husband's pick. Delicious! Think Greek eggrolls. The filling inside was so flavorful, they weren't too greasy, and the dipping sauces were great. We would definitely order this again. The bread basket is a basic French bread with butter.  My steak of choice was the Spencer Steak. I loved the flavor and tenderness of this steak. The homemade chips on the side were abundant and pretty good. The mushroom Rockefeller was a highlight on the plate. I loved the mushroom and took my husband's too. My sauce of choice was the Red Wine Demi and it was delicious. My husband went with the Bavette Steak and loved it. He had the Charred Onion sauce and it was out of this world delicious. We both varied from our usual steak choices and were glad that we did.   Our shared sides were Mashed Potatoes and Butternut Squash. The butternut squash was well prepared, but was probably not the most exciting of what they offer so I'd pass on this next time. The mashed potatoes were flavorful and a good choice. The dessert menu is all sundaes. We shared the Chocolate Cherry Sundae and loved it. The sundae is definitely large enough for two.",

    "text": "So I went here on a date recently.. the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic date! the host was very friendly and sweet. We walked up the stairs to a nice table by the windows. its far enough from other tables that you feel like you can have a nice conversation with the person you're with. The overall feel of the place is classy yet relaxing feel to it as well. The waiter we got was very attentive and was awesome. He was an older bald gentleman.. don't remember his name though. He seemed like he worked there for a while and knows his stuff. My date brought a couple of bottle of wines and the waiter was awesome at making sure the wine was poured into the glass decanter to bring out the flavor of the wine and he even poured it back into the bottle when we couldn't finish it all before we left. Service was amazing! top notch  So for starters we ordered the bone marrow carne asada.. my dates favorite dish! It was alright for me.. we also had Maryland lump crab cake as well.. which was tasty but nothing amazing. Just a normal crab cake.   So for dinner my date ordered the ribeye cap for $30 and I ordered the bavette which is supposed to be american kobe.. for $28. Price point for steaks is not bad.. the sauces they have for the steaks are pretty tasty too! So.. as far as my steak goes.. I was expecting a soft filet type of kobe steak... the steak I got was on the chewy side and definitely can't be cut with a fork.. I was not blown away by this steak.. I was expecting a better tasting steak with a better cut for what it was... maybe I should have ordered a the ribeye cap??.. which might of been more flavorful.. we also ordered sides too.. the mac and cheese.. was so good! as well as broccolini i believe...   Overall.. I would like to come back again.. this is a perfect date spot or a nice restaurant to come to with friends.. Service is great.. and food is good. I would recommend!",

They also let me pick dessert before she arrived!  The staff was all very kind and continuously wished her a happy birthday.  The food was good, but I think I'll do a fattier cut than the Spencer steak next time.  I did enjoy the portobello mushroom fries a lot though!",

My husband had the filet mignon and he said it was better than STK. we also got a crab cake, macaroni and cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes. All were so delicious.   Got the chocolate cherry desert for by birthday and also so good. This place is a must!   Only downside was its LOUD inside.

A group of about 10 of us came for a Sunday brunch. We were easily about to put in a reservation beforehand to ensure our spot. We ended up sitting in the inside dining room which was equally as nice as the patio.  As for food I had the smoked salmon. They gave me more than enough salmon along with the usual toppings of capers, onions, tomatoes and a bagel with cream cheese. This was probably one of the best salmon platters I've had. 5/5 Of course I also had to do a bottomless mimosa. I kind of liked that they present the champagne and the orange juice separately to ensure each person enjoys as much or as little of a mix as they want. They also don't skimp on the bottomless part. They were constantly coming around for refills.   So glad I finally tried this place and will most certainly be back again.",

We didn't have to wait long for a seat since we made reservations which you might want to consider doing since the place was busy when we arrived. The restaurant has a nice classy look to it and a balcony where you can eat also. The one thing they have is bottomless mimosas which is a benefit.now the food is good also. Now for the service it wasn't good at all are server came and took our order and it took about 30 minutes to get our food. After we received our food our server didn't come by to check on us ask if we needed anything else. Finally a busser came by to clear our plates from the table still no server. As we sat there waiting for our server to bring us the bill he never came by, we finally just had to waive someone over to bring us the bill. This was the worst service I ever received.",

    "text": "AN UPDATE  I was out of town for half a year in 2016. So, I was pleasantly surprised when we cane back to Echo and Rigs for a great dinner with our out of town friends a week ago, to see its newly reconfigured, inviting first floor! Our guests were impressed with its locale; the high-ceiling entrance, facing the grand stair case; the charming bar and lounge on the left and the stylish butchery on the right! The butchery shop now looks more stylish with its glass display meat lockers and an attractive demo area.  The friendly, charming hostess greeted us warmly and seated in the gorgeous balcony upstairs (elevator accessible). As expected, we enjoyed our scrumptious dishes, drinks and the impeccable service from Sam and his crew, which was attentive, friendly, yet not overbearing! The nice Mgr, Xavior, also came by our table to say hello, and helped out when the restaurant got super busy.   OUR DINNER:   APPS - all 5*  1. Broccolini - crunchy freshly and flavorful  2. Avocado toast - Buttery and tasty!  3.  Fried spinach salad - uncommonly crispy good! We ordered an extra!   4. Portobello fries - Simply must have! Yes, we ordered extra, too!    MAINS   1. Butcher cut - Skirt steak, with chips and mushroom, 4.0* - Juicy, flavorful; a bit tough to cut  2. Butter Fish, 5* - Flaky, tasty, buttery!  3. Steakhouse Cut- Filet mignon with chips and Rockefeller mushroom, 5* - Melts in mouth tender, juicy and flavorful!  We had 2 orders, BOTH mouthwatering good! Two of us ordered the same.   Over the years, my wife and I have enjoyed lunch, happy hour and dinner here, and we often entertain our guests here. By the way, their specialty Tomahawk steaks continue to wow us!  The waiter would make an impressive presentation of the huge tomahawk steaks on a ginormous tray. We actually had them in 2 occasions and found them superb! But, their menu offer so many other delicious selections!   I also like its happy hour (\"HAPPIEST\" hour as they call it), 3-6 DAILY & 10p-1a M-Sat, featuring draft @$3, wine and well drinks @4; selected drinks FREE to LADIES! The bar dishes are $2+.  BOTTOM LINE:   The quality of their dishes and service, and the casual yet almost elegant ambiance make us keep going back there for more. Our out of town guests like it so much that they even go back there by themselves!   June 2016",

    "text": "Hospitality here is amazing! Really memorable experience, and the food was excellent.  The location is a few miles off the strip which is great, because it gives you a chance to drive out and forget you're in one of the most touristy destination places in the Western world.  It's a newly developed plaza, so it may not show up on older GPS maps as I found out.  Better to use your phone instead.    So you pull up to this sprawling Italian influenced shopping center, Tivoli Village, complete with huge center fountain.  The restaurant is prominently located at the entrance across from a popular Italian restaurant and sports bar, near the fountain.  There is plenty of free parking if you don't want to valet.  When you enter Echo & Rig, it looks like an upscale butcher's, with fresh meat and sausages on display.  The hostess is extremely friendly, and got to know our party a little before selecting our table (where we were from, if it was our first time, etc).  They had tables out on the patio and a larger, beautiful dining area inside, next to the kitchen.  We sat inside, which was perfect.  The hostess took us upstairs via the elevator although there is a winding grand staircase, and she really makes us feel at home.  Once seated, we were greeted by I think the M'aitre d, Derrick, who welcomes us and thanks us for coming.  Our waiter, Raoul, then walked us through the menu and the specialty items, going through the ala carte menu as well which you can also order as appetizers.  There are so many small tapa like items to order, we got the lamb cigars and crab cakes which I highly recommend.  The small dishes range from $6, $8, and $10.  I also ordered a baked potato, which wasn't on the menu (although there is a baked sweet potato) but they happily made anyway that came with the steak.  For the main entrees, they have surprisingly a large variety of choices besides steaks.  There's several chicken dishes, seafood, pork, and even duck.  Of course, they are known as a steak house and their choice of cuts is superb.  I got the Rib Eye Cap (the best part of the ribeye) and was not disappointed.  Each entree came with homemade chips and potato cakes.  Every cut is, I believe, 10 ounces and was plenty big.  Grilled to perfection too, of course.  You can't go here without noticing the excellent service and modern technology implemented.  Derrick who I think is the M'aitre d again came out to chat with us after our appetizers came out to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and asked if there was anything we needed.  I ordered a beer and then less than a minute later someone from downstairs comes up and delivers my beer.  How did that happen so fast?  Also, we noticed that there were a couple of people with iPads just walking around making sure and double checking that everything was being done, which was somewhat surreal.  The level of communication and service here was extraordinary and worth another visit just to observe!    Finally, the GM of the restaurant came out to visit after the meal to invite us back and make sure everything was exceptional, which it was.  He even mentioned that they were planning to open another Echo & Rig in Los Angeles by next year and that the owner already owned a popular Italian steakhouse in DTLA, Botega Louie which I now want to try.  We were too full for dessert, but I would have to assume it would have been awesome.",

The only reason I am hesitant to give this place a 5 star is due to the steak we ordered was SOOO overdone! I couldn't believe they would even serve it - it was dry and Burned AF!  We just didn't expect a nice, fancy steakhouse like this one would serve such. The 4 star is for the impeccable service. Our bartender/waiter saw how burned the steak was...and did replace it.  The replacement was way better than burnt...but still was not medium rare. We recommend the place for Happy Hour on Saturday which goes from4-6pm",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I'm not a fan and I doubt I will ever be back to Echo & Rig.  We came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  We were brought our iced tea quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.  I had looked at the menu online and I took some time to decide once there.  For a starter, we ordered their portobello fries which were served with an herb aioli.  This was the first I noticed that anything that stated garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  The herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.  My wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though I suggested she get medium rare and I ordered the hanger steak blue.  She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  Garlic fail number 2.  All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.  The portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  Then we waited.  We saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  Approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  He took our small plates and silver away.  About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  About 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  This time, he was right.  When the steaks arrived, I noticed that both had been cut in slices and I just cringed.  I absolutely hate it when this is done.  Maybe that's why so FEW places do it.  I asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  When he came back he told us that the chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  My steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than I would do it at home.  My wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew that you wouldn't expect.  She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  But above all, I'd say, please don't cut my steak.  I'm not a two year old and I'm not infirm.  I Googled this when I got home and found that the only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.  We each had a sundae for dessert.  They were OK.  I left Echo & Rig very disappointed.  The length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  It was a Tuesday afternoon--not date night USA at 8 PM.",

Asparagus with a fried egg on top with Parmesan, perfectly cook and seasoned. The standout was their side of lentils with carrots and green onions. I have had lentils prepped in various was and several varietals, but this was their most surprising. I will definitely be back again. Highly recommend for anyone in the area.

But all was not lost. So many cuts to choose from! We decided to share a 50oz. Tomahawk Ribeye (even though my husband wanted it all to himself).    Our server was Samuel, he was excellent at explaining everything. All of our service experienced was fantastic. They addressed my husband as Mr. D... The manager stopped by to chat with us. We went on a Friday around 6 and there was no wait. We opted to sit outside on the patio, it's a heated patio so we stayed nice and warm.   We had some drinks over dinner and after...great selection of bourbon, whiskey and scotch, how can we not! We didn't catch his name but the bartender downstairs was knowledgable about all the bottles we asked about.   Before our steak we had some complimentary bread (which was delicious) and ordered the Carne Asada  Bone Marrow. Yum! Very flavorful, we would go back just for this!   Our steak was cook cooked perfectly. Nice crust of char on the outside, just enough red on the inside. Juicy and seasoned perfectly. It came sliced, bone on the side. We got some dipping sauces but they are not needed. We tried the Bleu Cheese, Red Wine Demi,  Chimichurri, and  Green Peppercorn....they were all tasty. It came with a  Stuffed Mushroom Rockefeller and a handful of Garlic Potato Chips. We ordered sides of Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Sharp White Cheddar (yum) and  Chile de Arbol  Roasted Cauliflower (nice spice).   I was full at this point but we decided if they'd make us just a regular Hot Fudge Sundae since they have the ingredients for it (their dessert menu is all ice cream). It was nothing special, just a sundae.  I would definitely go back, look forward to trying other items on the menu. I want to go now!",

    "text": "After hearing so much about this place from friends living in Summerlin, we finally made it.  Came for lunch, and it turned into a carni-whore pig-out fest! We ordered the Hangar meat entree with chips and mushroom - amazing! Meat was well seasoned, cooked to the right temperature and presented beautifully. We also ordered 2 small plates, 2 sides and a dessert. oink oink. The bone marrow carne asada and the octopus were both very exotic but definitely cooked perfectly, not over done as that's easy to do. The butter squash and cauliflower sides were both very unique and very delicious as well.   I really like the butcher shop modern decor on the first floor with the juice/sandwich bar for people on the run. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and has a very nice view of the Trivoli village fountain. Such a lovely place! The service was very friendly and attentive. Our waiter was funny and took good care of us.   Highly recommend!",

First off, the location of the restaurant is in a beautiful shopping center and is very easy to locate as soon as you get in. The restaurant itself is also very spacious and the dining area is primarily upstairs.   When you first walk in, you will immediately see on you right a very well decorated meat display and meat cutting. The service was phenomenal and the food was delicious. I ordered the lamb and it was cooked perfectly. All my other girlfriends really enjoyed their meal as well.   Overall, great place for a date night, GNO, or family dinner. You will not regret driving a little out of your way for this steakhouse.",

But it's okay there's bottomless mimosas! You can even control your ratio of champagne and orange juice which was so nice.   The service was great, we really couldn't get to the bottom of our mimosas before they refilled it. The manager also came up and asked us how we're doing. It's a nice extra touch to show that they care and even asked if we wanted sriracha to go with our short rib hash. It's feeling so fancy though since it was the first time in my life seeing sriracha served in a sauce cup haha.",

The interior was kept very clean modern, with a country style hint to it. Waiters and waitress staff was kept very uptight and professional long sleeve white button up flannels.  I ordered the butterfish and my partner ordered the very famous short rib grilled cheese. The first bite into my fish and it melted in my mouth the mango slices give it just the right amount of acidity and the balsamic and butter green onion gives a good balance. Texture is fantastic with a light brown crust at the top. The grilled cheese you kidding me the marriage with the short rib and mozzarella cheese is a perfect marriage. I just wished they added a sour soup on the side preferably tomato soup to balance the rich flavors.  Overall a great place to wine and dine I would definitely come back!",

As soon as we said that we woukd like water to drink we blinked and it was there on the table.   Now onto the food... Art explained the menu and made recommendations. We decided on the Portobello fries with aoili... AMAZING. I decided on the butterfish and it was delicious. It was not the best that I have ever had but it definitely did not disappoint. Rarely do I finish my but tonight it was clean. My boyfriend had salmon and it too was delicious and did not disappoint. I also had the black and blue berry mojito, oh I wish I would of had a 2nd one.   For dessert, which we don't usually do, we had the Carmel turtle and it was ah-maze-ing.    What was observed.... Being it was our first time we like to people watch, watch the staff and check out the crowd. The WHOLE team worked together as a TEAM. Watch closely and you will see how they communicate passing little card(s) and whispering about likes, dislikes, allergies, reason for visit, anniversary, bdays. We watched as each team member picked up to help the next. How the team in the kitchen worked together to get the food out. How ALL of them helped clean off plates and glasses from tables. To include the manager helping with getting food out to tables.   Thank you Echo and Rig Team for giving us an excellent experience.",

I'm going again and will update so hopefully the server will be more on point. Maybe he was having a bad day. The special Birthday sundae they made for my Mom was amazing!

    "text": "This is a wonderful restaurant for brunch. The reason it is getting four stars rather than five stars are for two main reasons: the first is that the service needs improvement in terms of how they serve their bottomless mimosas. There is one person that is assigned to pour champagne and he filled everyone's glass as he kept coming around. The problem is that he would pour champagne in your glass without asking if he could pour it into your glass. Some people like a little more juice in their Mimosa so I did not like the fact that somebody kept pouring champagne into my drink without asking me. I'm sure that if we asked, we could get a carafe of champagne to pour ourselves as we please. This should be the standard for this restaurant and not somebody coming around, pouring champagne into your glass without asking first. To me, that is seriously bad service. The second reason for the four stars is that we reserved on OpenTable and got their way earlier than other people, yet we were told that we could not get a table outside because they were already requested? At no point does the restaurant indicate that on OpenTable, nor in all of the times that I have been there which have been plenty. That was not cool to me. The restaurant tried to rectify it by giving us a complimentary serving of avocado toast, which was very nice of them, but we didn't really care for it because we ordered plenty of other food already. With that being said, we had a wonderful waitress who was just awesome. We ordered the steel cut oatmeal, the salmon with bagel and cream cheese and condiments, and the waffle with berries. It was all delicious. I will say that I did not order coffee, but I know there was a problem in serving with coffee. One of my friends was pretty frustrated because the person pouring coffee, which was the same person pouring the champagne, kept pouring coffee into her cup without asking first. Therefore, this is a great place for brunch, yet you want to make sure that if you are ordering a bottomless Mimosa, you are OK with a lot more champagne and a lot less orange juice, due to the way that it was being poured. Secondly, make sure to add notes to your OpenTable reservation or call to request a table on the outside patio.",

Our server (Oscar;Ask for him for sure) was amazing and so informative for 1st time clients (we will be back). We started w/the oysters and clams (AMAZEBALLS-Best I've ever had!!). And Now the STEAKS, The steaks, the mac n cheese, the garlic chips, the portello mushrooms, EVEN THE BREAD AND BUTTER....SUPERB! And they even allowed us to partake in their dessert the berry shortcake for my boyfriends birthday! very nice and light! If I was a food critic I would tell EVERYONE to dine here when you are in LV!

It was mostly because of our waiter Israel!  He brought out the steak tray to pick the steak they were cooking for me.  He knew the menus like the back of his hand but even more importantly, he was engaging throughout the meal.  3 or four times through the meal he grabbed my wife's phone and took a picture of us.  Even when walking out,  4 staff members thanked us for coming.  Can't wait to tell friends when they visit Vegas!",

    "text": "Stopped by here without a reservation and got seated at the bar at a rather busy time, self-seated and our waiter was quick and prompt. Complimented my date and was very enthusiastic about her dishes when I asked for suggestions. We ended up getting the King Salmon, Ribeye Cap, Oysters, and the Portobello Fries with Herb Aioli. Ribeye was requested medium and came out perfect, portobello fries were interesting and tasted amazing with the aioli however I only really enjoyed the first few. The king salmon was cooked well and went great with the carrot puree.  As for the negatives out of 3 selections of oysters only one was available during our time eating, we came at a rather busy time so it is understandable, along with that the garlic chips are really unappetizing with the steak and I believe that mashed potatoes or a savory green dish would be a better complement instead of the chips. Mushroom side was good however there was only one with the steak. Would have definitely enjoyed the steak more if sides were different.  Price wise in terms of food with a drink and side for dinner would likely hit you around $40 however this place is also good for a quick bite with the sandwiches, salads, and soups at around $7-15  Valet Parking is free which is a plus but overall the food was enjoyable service was amazing and I will likely come by again, though i hope I can substitute a different dish with the garlic chips.",

    "text": "When Bear reminded me that I needed to think about what restaurant I wanted to go to for my birthday, it's not like I was stumped for suggestions.  If one thing's for sure about Vegas, there will NEVER be a shortage of places to explore different cuisines, excellent to otherwise.  Echo and Rig was one I'd heard about before, and I saw it when we went to Tivoli Village to another eatery, Cantina Laredo, which was also excellent.  So once I saw it on Open Table as I flipped though, selecting it was a no-brainer.  Now, we like to pride ourselves on a knack for one-upping the quality level of our experiences, each time we go out to a new place to eat. Anyone who does knows that there's about a 50/50 chance you'll have a great time, or not-so-great.  I am over-the-moon to report that E&R was nothing but spectacular.   Let's start with walking in. More of a butcher shop that just happens to have a full bar downstairs, and a restaurant upstairs, the meat cases are the very first thing to capture your attention as you enter. And you realize immediately, seeing the impressive various cuts of steak and pork and who-knows-what-else on display, that no, Dorothy, we're not in Kansas anymore.  We ain't at the local Safeway Meat Department, either.  We were warmly greeted and invited to have a drink from the bar and a seat in the lobby, while we waited for them to get our table set. I don't think the chairs had a chance for our butts to warm them up, when the receptionist came and took us up to the dining room.  Once she seated us, again it was only a brief moment before our server, Sam, (fancy that - easy name to remember, too!) appeared to see to us.  When the wait staff in Vegas establishments is good, they are VERY good, and Sam is top-notch. Knowledgeable, witty, accessible and quick with great suggestions, he made sure that as the 'birthday boy', I was well taken care of, but he DEFINITELY made sure that we both got exceptional service, as did all the staff who delivered our several different courses.   Now, experienced 'foodies' know that because you spend a boatload of cash on a steak dinner, it doesn't necessarily equate to a GREAT meal. Echo And Rig makes any concerns you may have about that aspect disappear as quickly as the moisture from the misters out on the patio did, by laying down some of the best damn food I think we've had in the almost five-year span we've been designated 'local Las Vegans.'  The bread-and-butter starter as you peruse the menu is a 'green flag' for what's to come.  The bread is right-from-the-kitchen fresh (even if it isn't warm), with creamy, whipped, unsalted butter to go with, and they will keep bringing as much as you like.  But you'd best control yourself with that...you WANT to have room for all the other offerings, because they are worth it.  I have NEVER experienced anything like the Portobello Fries with Avocado Aioli before, and a few more go-rounds with them may convince me to '86' potato fries for GOOD. Golden brown with crispy, crunchy breading, they are as tender, juicy and meaty on the inside as you would expect portobellos to be, and the aioli complements them with a mild creaminess and flavor that never becomes too overpowering.  We kept forging ahead with the thick-cut bacon with barbecue sauce, (pig candy addicts everywhere, BEWARE - this will NOT help you kick your habit!), plus a bowl of what may be the greatest Onion Soup known to man.  I could have EASILY done three bowls of that with bread and a salad, and simply called it a day. (Glad I opted NOT to do that.)  When Sam explained how they handled the meat dishes, he treated us to the spectacle of a display tray of brontasaurus-sized slabs of beef. He told us the actual cuts were for family-style service and that we could opt for the saner cuts from the menu - which we did.  Bear's eyebrows arched in recognition of the Tri-Tip with the Santa Maria rub, (he hails from SLO), so there was no question what he was having.  After Sam answered my questions about the Spencer Steak, I went for that.  With our entrees, at Sam's enthusiastic urging, we had the cauliflower with Chile de Arbol, crispy shallots and the Kennebec Salt-and-Pepper fries.  Yeah, I know - I said the Portobello Fries were my new 'bae', but these reminded me of what it is about fries I dig in the first place...the crispy tenderness dunked into ketchup with a forkful of steak? ORGASMATRONIC.  Portions here aren't MAN VS. FOOD-sized, nor did they need to be.  With a great wine, we were pretty much stuffed to the gills by the time we got halfway through.  (Oh, yes...there WILL be doggie bags.) The beef was everything as advertised, and MORE. I may have even learned how to like medium-well steak now, (I usually won't eat steak unless Drogon has breathed on it. For a VERY long time.)  At the conclusion, Sam surprised me with a complimentary birthday dessert of two different sherbets, and that clinched the deal.  Amazing. Will we be back? Does Trump Tweet?",

Bottomless mimosas for $16 and the large glasses they were served in were constantly being refilled, not once was my glass empty for more than 60 seconds.. They also do bottomless Bloody Mary's for a few dollars more.   I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the Steakhouse Scramble.  The Eggs Benedict were good but the plate had such an overwhelming amount of spinach that I ended up pushing most of it off to the side. The Steakhouse Scramble was also good but the server forgot to bring out the sauce my boyfriend requested and brought it 20 minutes later when he was almost finished eating. I know he forgot about it because he walked passed us plenty of times empty handed and asking people at other tables if everything was okay. It wasn't a huge deal honestly it was just awkward when he finally brought the sauce out and my boyfriend had 2 bites left, he could've mentioned something or even apologized. Again, not that big of a deal for us.   We also ordered the thick cut bacon and it comes with homemade BBQ sauce, you must order this! I wasn't a huge fan of bacon until I tried this it was so thick, flavorful and juicy. I will make sure we place 2 orders every time we come because we were fighting for it, it was that good ;)  Also, make sure you make reservations because we didn't and we weren't able to sit outside. Sucks because I love the outdoors, I sometimes pick where to eat based on the fact that they have outdoor seating  Overall a good experience. We will try this place again but make reservations next time.",

    "text": "One of the most fabulous restaurant experiences I have ever had. Flew to Las Vegas from The Bay the first week of April. I called Echo and Rig a few weeks before after researching their stellar reviews on Google and Yelp. Every hostess that answered the phone was incredibly polite, engaging, and accommodating even going so far as to asking the correct spelling of the birthday girls name to enhance our experience. My friends and I arrived a few minutes late to our 7 pm reservation after a 20 ish minute ride from Planet Hollywood on the strip. The outdoor patio is not able to be reserved and is one of their most popular seating locations in the restaurant (heated patio that overlooks Tivoli square, really breathtaking when the sun sets.) Our party was seated on the patio and greeted by the upstairs host, the server, and even the manager. I, unfortunately have forgotten his name, but his introduction and subsequent questions about our stay and how honored he was that we came to celebrate at his restaurant truly made the experience. The food of course was outstanding. I had the skirt steak (melt in your mouth) and my girls had the Colorado lamb (moist, tender, and full of flavor). The delicious salted caramel sundae that was presented after the staff sung \"Happy Birthday\" was amazing! Creamy ice cream that wasn't too overwhelming and had lovely crunchy elements to it. All in all if you're debating about coming, don't! Make your reservation and let the staff and the food make your night one to remember. I think the best part is knowing that they've just opened a sister restaurant in Sacramento, Ca. So I'll be able to experience this wonderful restaurant again.",

Finally the boo made time to make the trek out with me :D It was either Echo & Rig or Brio so we decided on the one with A+ reviews :0) It was Saturday around 6/7pm and the wait was 40 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar.   We ordered: x Over The Rainbow Salad (farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette) - this salad is AMAZINGG!! So much texture and so fresh! They were kind enough to split the dish for us without even asking. I highly recommend this. x Maryland Lump Crab Cake - I'm not sure what to say about this crab cake.. it was good, but not very crab cakey.. it was like it's own thing. Good flavors, but just not what we were expecting. x Bouillabaisse (prawns, clams, calamari, mussels, fish of the day, black tomato broth) - Lots of flavor and good, but I prefer lighter broth/sauces. Clams were a little overcooked, but overall this dish was good. x 1/2 dozen oysters - I forgot the name of the oyster, but they were the smallest ones they had that day and they were AMAZING! The sauces that came with it made it that much better.  Loved the vibe of this place. Looks upscale/trendy, but we came in casual shorts and stuff and it was fine :)  I want to come back to try every other seafood/veggie dish asap!!",

The first indication was when the waitress set a beer in front of me when I had a cocktail and my husband didn't. Then my medium well steak was rare and served with the wrong sauce. My husband ate his 31st anniversary dinner by himself while I waited another 15 minutes for my steak to be cooked. They brought us food we didn't order. Our desert never showed up. At the beginning of dinner the waiter asked us if we had other plans. We told him yes a show at the Palazzo Hotel. That did not matter we are late for our show. They ruined our 31st anniversary. Will not go back.",

    "text": "I've been a little apathetic with my reviews lately, but really feel inclined to write one for this place given the extremely awesome experience we had here over the weekend. When it comes to a holistic dining experience Echo & Rig executed perfectly on all aspects of what \"I\" (just my humble opinion; others are entitled to their own...) deem as important when eating out.  This place is a restaurant/bar/butcher shop. As you walk in you can see them butchering meat behind the counter to the right, to the left is a bar with some small tables and upstairs is the dining area. This place sources really high end meat from Snake River Farms and Compart Duroc (pork)!! The customer services was top notch, our waiter was super attentive and we were greeted and checked upon by management before, during and after our meal. The food was excellent; since this was a butcher shop we chose to order some non-traditional cuts such as the ring of rib eye and the bevette (hope I didn't butcher the name; pun intended...). Steaks, small plates, salad and drinks were beyond excellent. The waiter recommended the portobello fries and they were delicious. We also ordered the grilled octopus, kennebec salt & pepper fries (same potatoes In & Out uses), broccolini and shared a Caesar salad. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted great. I'd say this is the best dinning experience that I had in the last year (we eat out often).   This place is unique because it is very evident they are extremely focused on working with most fresh and \"best\" ingredients, their customer service second to none, the environment is lively, elegant and welcoming, and the prices are reasonable (compared to \"Vegas Strip\" prices).   My new steakhouse/restaurant in Vegas is no longer Mastro's, it is Echo & Rig (we may still go there for the Butter Cake LOL). THERE! I SAID IT!!!! STANDING OVATION...",

The setting, the food, and the atmosphere really made this an enjoyable dinner while visiting in town for the week.   Our table ordered everything from the Steak Tartare, to the Portobello Fries, to the  thick bacon with bbq sauce which the bacon was made in house ( it was the BEST bacon I've ever had). my boyfriend loves the Oysters too, and the men had the Butterfish and were raving about it.",

We ordered several items and they all tasted fantastic.  Favorites were the avocado toast, beef rib hash, and the sherbet spiked with champagne.   Echo and Rig offered fantastic service-probably the best service I've had in a while.  The hostess quickly greeted us, found us a table, and we were seated. Our server was extremely nice & helpful. I never felt like the staff was overbearing, yet they were attentive.   Bottomless mimosas: $16 (June 2016) served with a bourbon soaked cherry at the bottom of the glass. They give you a glass with champagne and a carafe of orange juice. The servers walk around and top off the champagne. And bring a new carafe of OJ when you run out. Our glasses were never dry!  They also offer bottom bloody Mary's. I believe these were $21   Avocado toast: simple yet delicious. No shortage of avocado. Avocado slices on a baguette, maybe drizzled with olive oil?  Served with peppers on the side- mild heat. Very tasty. Will definitely order again.   Beef rib hash: my new favorite brunch item!  I don't usually favorite the highlighted menu item-but this one hits the spot. Beef rib with egg and hollandaise sauce and veggies. This is a must try!    Steakhouse scramble: tasty, but I prefer the beef rib hash.  Steak with veggies and potato chunks.    Shortcake with fresh berries: the fruit was perfectly ripe and the shortcake was good.   Sherbet: Three flavors of sherbet served with fresh berries. Omg amazing. Add a little champagne to liven up this dessert.",

    "text": "Excellent food at very reasonable prices.  I had a chance to go off the beaten path in Las Vegas to have a dinner with a large group at Echo & Rig.  They are known for Grass Fed beef from organic providers such as Snake River Farms and others.  When you enter, you will see the meat coolers of the butcher shop with some very good looking beef, and other cuts.   As we started dining, we all tried several appetizers. I'm generally not a lamb fan, the the lamb cigars were awesome, as was the bacon and pork belly.  On to the steaks. Most of the group opted for sharing the large cuts; Porterhouse, Rib-eye, etc.  Since I like my meat rare, I ordered a Wagyu Filet.  The waiter suggested a temp closer to medium rare, and I said OK. My mistake.  When the steaks arrived, the large cuts were a classic medium rare, with a slightly warm RED center. OK for me, but several of the diners were expecting a bit more doneness. I can't fault them for that, but my filet was more like medium.  I should have followed my instincts and ordered rare. The quality of the steak was excellent, just done past my liking. I did sample some of the porterhouse, and it was outstanding. Great aged flavor.  The sides and sauces were great too, and the prices were lower than expected. I would have given 5 stars, but for the overcook on my steak. I'm sure they would have corrected it if I had asked, but with the large group, I was happy to sample some of the larger steak instead. I'd definitely go there again. My suggestion is to make sure you are specific to understand the temp requests. Other than that 5 stars!",

Don't get me wrong, they were very professional, yet so genuinely warm and inviting as if they were welcoming us into their own home.   The prices were reasonable considering the high quality of their steaks. Additionally, we ordered 3 sides for our party of 4, and there were leftovers.

The eggs were more of a brown color and the two pieces of what was suppose to be Filet Mignon were the size of a quarter and almost impossible to cut and equally impossible to chew. The dish actually looked as if all the leftovers were thrown in it. We did send it back and they promptly replaced it with another dish. The real zinger came when I asked if we could have fresh champagne glasses and were told no by the waitress \"We don't do that with the Bottomless Special\"  Are you kidding me !!!!!!!! I have never been anywhere in my life where I could not get a fresh glass for anything. And how much effort would it have taken to please the customer especially since mine had avocado on the rim? Enough went wrong that I'll think twice about returning with all of the new cutting edge restaurants opening. I would suggest that the owners of Echo & Rig take a step back to the beginning when everything was perfect. You've lost 3 customers !!!!!",

    "text": "Echo & Rig is a steak house with a small retail-butcher shop inside.  Super close to us, and very well rated, my wife and I were looking forward to coming here for sometime, and now that we've been several times, it's one of our absolute favorites in this town.  Their happy hour is what drew us in originally. With specials such as top shelf vodka cocktails (Kettle One, Hanger One, etc.) for $4, steak and egg for $1.99, who wouldn't be curious?  Their food is top notch, and recently, we purchased a couple pork chops from their butcher section, and were very, very pleased! Kyle, who's usually manning the butcher shop, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and asked what some of our favorite cuts are, prior to recommending the cut we got. It's nice to have that kind of expertise when shopping for high end chops!  Atmosphere is also stellar here. It's a great date spot, as well as, just a casual setting if you're just at the bar.

    "text": "I'm going to start this review off with the customer service I experienced because honestly it was unlike anything I've ever experienced. Tonight was my birthday and we had a table of four with Tim as our server. Let me tell you about Tim because this review is mostly about him. He was so courteous, genuine, and friendly. He had an energy that was both welcoming and warm, the kind you get when you hangout with an old friend after not seeing them for a while. He was so incredible not just at his job but also his people skills. He knew so many things from the menu, and recommended some phenomenal dishes, he was thoughtful and professional. I dine out very often with friends and I can't think of one time the customer service anywhere has blown me away like it did today.   Now on to the food. Wow. Everything was perfectly cooked and incredibly delicious. I had the sea bass and it tasted like Jesus caught it and cooked it himself. The garlic mashed potatoes were awesome and the creamed kale was soooo good! For dessert I had the apple pie ice cream and it was everything I always wanted.   Ambience is great, upscale yet everyone is super friendly and not boujie like other upscale restaurants I've been to. I've actually been here once before and didn't have the best experience but I'm so glad we came back and gave it a chance because now I'm telling all of my friends how amazing it was and asking for Tim every time I come back.",

He   completely missed my friends salad when she ordered it, and had to be reminded. The appetizers took longer than expected to come out. This was a Tuesday night so the restaurant was not that busy, I'm not sure what the holdup was. I ordered the New York Strip, which is my usual when ordering steak. I'm used to some marbling, but this cut was extra fatty. Strangely, someone took away an almost-full side of mashed potatoes before we asked them to. The octopus app, the kale and the peas and mashed potatoes were good. I probably wouldn't come back here, since Vegas has many other restaurants to choose from.  Overall, I was disappointed in the slow service and wasn't really happy with my steak.",

Had first meal at Echo & Rig at the bar last nite and my only complaint is it was chilly (cold nite) and felt like I was in a bldg lobby, but dining room was full. A minor inconvenience for my lack of making a reservation, as this place delivered on all fronts...from service - Jose was excellent and offered great suggestions, to the selection- (going back soon -too many things we wanted to try but would have been an embarrassment of food), to the flavors-the portobello fries, spicy roasted cauliflower (my pers fav), to the rib cap eye, spencer steak (meat was cooked to perfect temp, so flavorful and at $25-$27 each was a perfect serving size) and garlic cheddar mashed potatoes...what a meal, to finally the very affordable pricing- (incl 2 well shaken martinis and a glass of wine and beer). Very impressed on all fronts and can't remember when the last time a restaurant experience was so perfectly complete (and we just had Christmas Eve dinner at Carnevino -meh!). I look forward to many a more pleasant evenings here.",

The hostess was great and engaged in great conversation as she walked us to your table. She automatically apologized for the wait and it wasn't that bad. We appreciated it. The manager came by shortly as we sat and introduced himself to us by name and was so kind and apologetic. They get five stars for their table touching and atmosphere !

Got two rounds of drinks...first round was 5 dollars less than second....for the same exact drinks.

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by two hostess' who walk you up to your table making small talk about how the restaurant works and what the occasion is we have joined them for. Once seated, the server takes full control and walks us through the menu, elaborating on his favorite dishes and the most popular items. Unfortunately this time around it was only two of us or we would have gone with their delicious Tomahawk presented to us on a platter with all their fresh cuts of beef. To begin, we ordered a Tempranillo that paired well with our three starters (Flash fried spinach salad is a MUST, along with the watermelon cucumber salad that adds the sweet/salty mix to your tastebuds. Our meat selection for this meal was the beef tenderloin cooked MR and the cowboy marinade skirt steak served M that was full of flavor and quite honestly \"blew our minds\". At this point of a meal we didn't think it could possibly get any better until they brought up their 20 and 30 year ports to finish us off right. This steakhouse could quite possibly take over Las Vegas or anywhere it expands to. Do not hesitate to give this place a shot. You will surely be overjoyed with the camaraderie of staff and the love and pride they have in their establishment.",

Actually, management spoke with us the next day and was very concerned with what went wrong and what could make it right.  That impressed me.  Usually large restaurants don't have the time to apologize, solve the problem, and try to right their wrong.  Echo & Rig did that tonight.  It wasn't because this was a free meal, especially because after the incident we went to TAO and had a feast.  They did a great job because as a consumer this is not only what I expect but I KNOW this is what they expect from themselves.  To the management staff, servers, and cooks thank you for being honest and True to your brand.  Thank you for taking this situation head on where most companies would have ran.  I will be back, I will be bringing people to your business, and I hope that every guest gets the True Echo & Rig experience that I received and know that you can give.",

Our favorites for brunch are the Portobello Mushroom Fries, The Fried Spinach Salad, The Short Rib Hash, Quiche or the Grilled Cheese with Short Rib and Gruyere!!  YUM!!!  The steaks are also Great and they double as a butcher downstairs so you can take your favorite cuts to go and cook them at home too.

Both great people that were genuine and very knowledgeable about the menu and what it means to have a dinner experience. We got oysters and tuna poke to start, followed by shareable small plates of portobello fries, bone marrow carne asada, and steak tartare. Everything was delicious and strategically coursed out by Jason as far as timing was concerned. The main dish provided a GIANT tomahawk steak which my wife and I split and a family style dish of mashed potatoes. It was delicious, fun and everything we hoped for in going out for a special meal together. Not only was the food great, the staff was prompt with clearing our dishes, we had new silverware for every course, and the people are generally pleasant to be around. I felt like I got to know them as people and that was important to us. Wonderful experience, HIGHLY recommended and will be returning soon. Thanks Echo & Rig!!",

He was very helpful and shared his knowledge about the meats. Once we were seated our server was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. My mother-in-law had the butter fish and she enjoyed it, but once she tasted my t-bone and my wife's ribeye she wished she had ordered a steak. My steak was great, (t-bone) but my wife's Ribeye was excellent l. The Bacon and Bbq sauce app was amazing, the mash potatos  were fantastic. My Mother-in-law is coming back tomorrow night. I highly recommend eating here. An enjoyable experince.",

We ordered appetizers and some side salads as well. The drinks were really good and the service was on point.   However, ALL of our 5 steaks were under cooked and the scallops were raw. The manager who came over to our table apologized and had our food redone. After we complained about all of our entrees, it seemed as if she was not too pleased. I'm not too sure whether this was directed at us or her staff. Some of our appetizers were burnt. By the time the food was redone, everything else in the table was cold and we had been waiting for more than an hour for food.   I really wanted to like this place as it was highly recommended by a friend. But with our experience, I would just simply not go back.",

I had a glass of Opaque Darkness wine  it was full bodied and so nice. We split a Caesar salad with out croutons because are keto. Then also split the 34oz Tomahawk. Cooked to perfection.

After I received my steak it was cooked more rare then medium and overheard our server telling the table next to us that there's a Rib-Cap left and he's lucky he gets it. Such a shame because I loved this place. Really puts a bad taste in my mouth and won't be seeing me back anytime soon :(",

With an ample selection beyond meat and a broad section of cuts available, all at very reasonable prices is why this hidden gem has become such a favourite.  Friendly, none tourist harassed staff are knowledgeable and very helpful.   The one and only slight critic I have and why they lost a star, was cause the filet mignon only comes in one size and for a big guy like me, was a little to petit.  On the good side, it left space for dessert.  Enjoy but don't let to many people know :-), let's keep it off the Vegas tourist trap map.",

Plates start as low as $4 and the happy hour food prices can't be beat.  $1 for a good hot dog, $1.99 for shrimp, etc.  Not a huge selection, but the food is great and again, the prices can't be beat.  This place is great for date night or a small group of friends. The only issues we've had here is with bigger groups - even if you make a reservation, it'll take a while to get seated.  Plus the service and cooking times are always a bit worse at busy restaurants. It would take a long time to get outta there if you had a big group (esp with kids).",

We ordered two orders of the steak and eggs, two orders of the shrimp cocktail and a hot dog. We also brought two of our bottles of wine that had no corkage fee. Our happy hour bill came up to a total of $10!  We then had dinner upstairs and I highly recommend the portabello mushroom fries. They were all out of the ribeye cap steak so we had to settle for the european cut steak. I thought the steak was good but not great. I normally wouldn't rate lower because of that but since this is a steakhouse and should be their specialty, I had to deduct a star for that. The service is top notch and I would definitely come back if we're in the area.",

From the lovely hostesses to our Server Ariyeh who was fun, warm and gave us superb recommendations.  The waitstaff were spot on and seamless, but most important the menu is broad and creative.  Although Echo & Rig bills itself as a meat heaven we chose for our first visit to dive into the lengthy list of small plates that included Portobello fries, fried chicken oysters, and burnt pork belly tips among their more interesting creations...all were sublime!  This restaurant is spacious with a bar and market on the ground floor and indoor and outdoor dining on the second floor.  We chose to sit outdoors on their veranda with beautiful views of Tivoli Village and it's scenic fountain.  Honestly, as a born and raised New Yorker I have never experienced such a great combination of ambiance, service and great food...I was \"Kvelling\"(look it up you non New Yorkers). We will be regulars at Echo & Fig and look forward to our next visit to try their top notch steaks!",

    "text": "Happy hour review only.  Echo & Rig is a steakhouse at the south end of the Tivoli Village shopping/living center. They happen to offer an happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6p, Sat-Sun 4-6p) in the first floor bar area, with options that were enticing enough to draw me and a few friends in to check it out.  My eyeballs practically popped out of their sockets at the sight of $3 draft beer. That's nearly unheard of on any sort of even semi-regular basis, and they actually have interesting craft beer-type selections too. I got the Almanac Passion Project and Saugatuck Bonfire Brown, both of which were quite delicious and neither of which had I seen much if at all before in the Las Vegas area. Three local beers and five other beers, ranging from craft to mass-produced, were also available. Those not so beer-inclined can do a $5 wine glass or $4 liquor (I'd presume cocktail).  The food selections were somehow far less diverse than the beverage options, but they were also priced very reasonably. I tried some of each.  Steak And Egg ($1.99): a rather small piece of steak (chef's choice as to the cut) with one fried egg per portion. I got two of them, and although the eggs were perfect with beautiful runny yolks, one piece of steak ended up being cooked to medium-well, while the other did stay pink but took on a bit too much salt on the crust.  Shrimp Cocktail ($1.99): some of the tiniest and softest shrimp around, but the portion was reasonable and the bed of greens were fresh and provided enough texture.  Echo Dog ($1): considering that they use Hebrew National dogs, this preparation was almost too simple, but the dijon mustard and sauerkraut were reasonable toppings and a quick thinker might find some use for extra eggs from other happy hour orders. I don't see how you can go wrong with $1 anyway.  I find it hard to entertain the idea of driving out here from Henderson all the time, but they have easily one of the best happy hours around for people who want affordable craft beer and a few bites of food. Also, after seeing those beautiful meats in the fridge, I also should put a proper meal here on the agenda.",

The service was also friendly, helpful and attentive.  We will definitely be stopping by again.",

    "text": "I came in without a reservation, but it was a Wednesday night and a bit slow, so the maitre d got us seated quickly and courteously. They messed up on the guest note and put \"Mr.\" down on my girlfriend's name, which was funny because they addressed me by my girlfriend's name, but that's not a big deal, especially considering how great of a time we had.  Quick note on the restaurant layout: the restaurant itself is upstairs and the floor is lovely with plenty of spacing between tables and a nice view of the tivoli roundabout. Not loud. Very pleasant.  Our server was Ricky and he was amazing. So friendly, funny, and he gave us such a great overview of the menu and explanation of specific items. We started with two cocktails: the le passion, which was great, very well balanced, and the white lightning, which was way too sweet for my taste, but maybe I shouldn't have chosen a cocktail with brown sugar in it. Then Ricky recommended the portobello fries as a starter and they were a revelation. You must try them.  For our meal we had the kale salad, which was sweet, light, exactly what you'd expect, then followed with tie-dye salmon, which was incredibly moist and went perfectly with the asparagus one coconut rice its served with. The kitchen also sent us a cauliflower and chile dish gratis, but I can't remember the name of it. It was incredible, a perfect balance of sweetness and spice. I'll certainly order it when I'm back.  We finished with sundaes: one with all three sorbets and the other and apple sundae, which tasted like an apple a la mode. Both were absolutely delicious, but also enormous. I expected them to be medium in size like the other dishes we had, but no, these things were enormous. Definitely meant to be shared.   Overall it was a great night. I'd highly recommend this place. And if you call in a reservation, ask for Ricky as your server.",

    "text": "Wher do I start, this place is unique and unusual. A high end gourmet butcher where you take a walk into the meat locker to discuss curing and cuts with a personal expert. Step out of the meat locker, and you'll see a bar which also has a chef making sandwiches and other treats.   I should mention that Echo & Rig is located in a very upscale shopping area where most of the cars are high end showroom exotics and the people walking around are all well buffed, shined, and jeweled with the finer things that money buys.  So for most people going here is a high end rare treat, not the kind of place us mere mortals eat at often. My family and I showed up here after a long day hiking and we really were not dressed to be here. We also had a few small kids with us, embarrassed we asked to be seated outside even though it was a cold night.  The staff could have been rude, or ignore us for our honestly dirty and sweaty clothes, but we were treated with all the importance and respect as the well dressed wealth around us.We were seated outside on a third floor balcony with an amazing view over the fountains and view down the street of all the upscale shops and lights.  The balcony had very well placed gas heaters above us and the typical pedestals kind which gave our table a surprising warmth absorbed by the heat making the cold patio perfect even in the cold of a winter's night.  We had two waiters, one who never spoke to us but kept the bottled spring, and sparkling water flowing (which is included without charge) and wonderful bread. He kept our table clear but was never intrusive or interrupted our conversations, in fact we were surprised how rarely we noticed him. Our second waiter was the spokesmen as well as server. He brought out the most beautiful and huge cuts of meat and described how they were aged. The meat he presented would be your actual cuts they would grill for you. Because I had a very large group with me, and I was buying for all we opted to stay away from the $75 dollar steaks and went for  burgers, sandwiches and other items. Even so we were treated like kings. We also ordered a few appetizers.  Our waiter also brought out several things to try that we did not order and were not asked to pay for. He was great about educating us and describing each perfect treat he brought out.  Everyone was pleased with what we ordered, even ordering a few things to take back to our hotel rooms. If we lived in LV this would be high on our list for date nights and special occasions. We were served with such expertise and professionalism even as we were so poorly presented that we can't wait to go back!  And yes all the food was great, it's a couple weeks later and we are still talking about it, this meal was the highlight meal of the week long trip for all of us.",

I recommend this place to any fan of beef.",

    "text": "What a great night for a bone in steak. We ended up at our usual spot-Echo & Rig-for one of our indulgent dinners for the month. We dined and had cocktails, ending on a high note--complimentary dessert--their turtle sundae.   I tried their rib cap, flat iron, sirloin, and hanger steaks. This was the first go at the bone in ribeye.  Nicholas, our amazong server, helped us choose a great xut. The chef cooked it perfectly, simply seasoned to allow the quality cut to speak for itself. I tried a dip in the peppercorn, charred onion, and red wine sauces, but they are unnecessary with the steak. It's succulent, sexy, and the salty fat crust that turns into a heavenly cracker on the sides of each slice made my eyes roll back in ecstasy with every bite.   I began a love affair with this restaurant since their doors opened, and continue to return for the surprises in every meal, the quality, the impeccable service, and the fact that what costs 5 bills on the strip is readily available in the neighborhood. With great cocktails and amazing meats, I return to their open arms for moments like the one this steak provided.",

Why 4 stars and not 5? We arrived for our reservation and waited at the front desk for several minutes without being acknowledged. There are stairs right across the door so we wondered if the host was upstairs? Did we walk over to the butcher or the bar? A little sign or something would be great to let people know that they're in the right place since seating is upstairs and I bet it takes a few minutes to show someone to their table, leaving the front unmanned.  Will we go here again? Hell yes! Would we drive out of our way to come here again? Yup!",

    "text": "This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!  I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.  With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.    We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.    I got the \"Spencer Steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.  Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.    I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.     The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.    Say hi to the pig heads outside!!",

We had a large party of 11 with reservations but for some reason, the hostess sat the wrong group down and we waited even longer for them to accommodate us.  I was a bit annoyed at this situation since I checked in with them 3 times in a period of 15 minutes and told them where we were standing but they got mixed up with the other group (party of 9) and we were left standing there for another 15-20 minutes.  The managers apologized, there was nothing complimentary given but after eating there, it made up for the stars lost.    Food here was amazing and at a decent price.  Their steak has a great char encrusted on both sides and cooked perfectly to my liking.  There are many sauces you can choose to pair with the steak.  Many different cuts but we went with the Rib-eye.  They also have larger cuts (Tomahawks) for large groups but we went with our individual cuts of meat.    The side dishes are delicious.  I'd definitely recommend - Asparagus with eggs - Brussel sprouts - Sweet cauliflower  Each of these dishes has a grilled char or a roasted char which brings out amazing flavors from the vegetables.  Delicious and will definitely make you want another bite after another.   Dessert - they have different sundaes which were delicious, but no unique desserts here.    Service - was okay.  Our waiter was a bit bossy and some of my friends felt offended by how he addressed them.  I do understand that dealing with a large group is difficult, but maybe tone down the attitude just a tad bit.    Ambience - clean, modern, slightly rustic.  Chairs were not the most comfortable.    Even though the beginning was a rough start, the food made up for it and I'd definitely come back for the food.  There needs to be a new system for the hostess where they make a note on articles of clothing of the individual who checked in also verify if indeed it is the group they are seating.    I was told the brunch here was something I need to check out as well, so next time!",

He was very friendly and answered all of our questions. The desserts were amazing!",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere here, especially upstairs on the patio. It tends to be a little hot in the summer months, and too cold in the winter. Had a great lunch this fall with a couple business associates. Salads were had all around. Pretty solid in presentation and taste. Exceptional service. However, the last couple dinners I have had were disappointing. I'm not sure why the homemade potato chips are piled on each plate, clearly overpowering in the presentation of the dish. Unfortunately the last couple times, they had not been very good either. Greasy and burnt. I watched several people at my table removed them completely as soon as the waiter left the table. I've had better house made chips at some of the dive bars in town. My butterfish, not very buttery. It was over cooked, dry, and not flaky. Didn't understand that plating either, served with root veggies, only white/yellow, there was no color to the plate what so ever. Whatever that brown saucy reduction was, so sweet, didn't add to the taste or presentation. My fiance said his filet was cooked perfectly, and loved the mashed potatoes. Overall, the presentation of the last couple of meals was not appealing, and unfortunately, the taste this time was nothing special either. Service was exceptional. There are so many great restaurants in the area, Echo and Rig is not my favorite anymore.",

Maybe it was the cut of meat that I got (bavette). It wasn't as tender as I thought it'd be, and it was flavored pretty well. The garlic chips were delicious. I also ordered the butternut squash. It was good, but the honey was a little too much for me.   Overall I think the food was just too plain for the ambience of the place. It was a little underwhelming with the food. I would like to go back and check the brunch menu out.",

The customer service is off the hook. If you've never been there before they definitely give you all the info on their steaks and what they have. They bring them out on a wooden plank and explain everything to you as far as what stakes they have according to what you like. They are very attentive and are always making sure your glasses are filled and making sure you don't need anything else. My favorite is the filet mignon it melts in your mouth and the flavor is to die for. The garlic mashed potatoes and the mac & cheese and the portobello fries wow... so yummy. I have to say the prices are good compared to some of the other steak houses I've eaten in Vegas. And if it's your birthday not only do they bring you ice cream they bring enough for the whole table. So if you're splurging and you want to great steak and a great night with great service I highly recommend this hidden gem for you to try. Just make sure you have a reservation so you don't have to wait.",

But regardless a brunch here is a great choice to make worth the amazing options they give you. Also give the grilled bacon a try super tasty and the flavor is mild enough to go with other dishes trotted the ceviche also but it was a bit lackluster to say the least I expected more citrus in the dish. My entree was the NY breakfast sandwich very well put together great flavor profile loved it.  My gf got the rainbow breakfast which she said was very tasty so withe would be a good option for you to try. I would also like to put out a big thank you to Brian Rosenthal the brand ambassador for making us feel so welcome and taking the time to share some stories with us while we waited for our order it made our experience a memorable one.we look forward to our next visit for the dinner service.",

    "text": "First off, this review has nothing to do with the food or the waitstaff, both are excellent!! As a matter of fact, Ramon, our server this most recent time was amazing and we appreciated everything, he certainly improved the experience.   I tried Echo and Rig for the first time about a year and a half ago, my boyfriend and I loved the food and experience and from then on came for all special occasions including; our birthdays, anniversaries & valentines day. We even recommended it to our friends and family who have also made it their celebration destination. Which brings me to our most recent experience on May 21, 2016, for my sisters birthday. I called almost a week ahead of time to make a reservation, the hostess asked if it was a special occasion & if we had any special requests. I requested to be sat on the patio, as it is a much nicer experience than sitting inside (personal preference). The hostess assured me this would not be a problem because I had made the reservation so early. We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation, we checked in and sat in the bar area. The hostess told me that they were running a bit behind but would seat us a quickly as possible. I did not consider waiting a few extra minutes to be a problem, 30 minutes later we still had not been sat, so we went to check on the reservation. At this point we were not mad but we were frustrated, as the whole point in making a reservation is to avoid the wait. The hostess then told us that they were running behind due to prom and that they would seat us as quickly as possible. At 8:15 we were called by the hostess, 45 minutes late but we were happy that we were finally being seated. She takes us to a table inside. After waiting 45 minutes we weren't going to get a table outside as requested, after being assured that this would not be a problem. We spoke with a manager, he said he would have us wait a few more minutes at the table inside, get us started and then move us to a table outside. At that point we were all extremely angry because we had a 7:30 reservation and still hadn't been sat but were doing our best to understand, as we know that you can't control how long people stay at the table. So, we asked that they open the bottle of wine that we had brought so we could kill more time with a cocktail. He said he would get a decanter & take care of this right away, 10 minutes past and we had no wine glasses, no decanter and still no wine. Finally after asking another server who walked by where our wine was the manager came back over with no decanter & opened the bottle of wine. About 5 minutes later we were sat outside, at that point we had waited an hour for our reservation.... The manager explained that Ramon would be our waiter and that the manager who oversees the meal would ensure our experience from here on out was great. He also asked Ramon to get us started with something special, as I mentioned Ramon was great! However, they brought out a two salads for the table as well as a fresh fruit salad. This was very nice of them, however, they didn't ask what our table would prefer when it came to the salad options... I was a bit disappointed with that considering the experience we had already had. Also, the manager never came over to speak with us, apologize or address the problem. This was the second poor experience I have had when it came to seating. I feel this may be an ongoing problem that needs immediate attention.   Echo and Rig used to be where we celebrated our special occasion, after this most recent experience we will not be back. We have a birthday celebration coming up and we have already decided to go to another steakhouse.",

Often when dining near the end of dinner service, service tends to be rushed, and distant. However that was not the case at Echo & Rig, our server and team was extremely attentive, and welcoming. The food was also very delicious as well. The Mac and cheese was hands down the best I've ever had and I strongly recommend it. It's rich, creamy and full of flavor. I also had the rib eye which was cooked a perfect medium rare and was so tender I used a butter knife to cut it with. The wife had the bouvett cut and was pleased with hers as well. She also had the Le passion martini which she found to be very refreshing. Echo & Rig really lives up to the reviews in delivering excellent service, quality food, at an affordable price! I highly recommend veering off the strip a bit and trying this fine establishment for yourself. You won't be disappointed!",

Sit on the patio- we were inside as I thought it would be too cold, and when I changed my mind they graciously moved us.  They asked immediately if it was a special occasion.  It was my birthday, but I said I'm not into sweets, so no bother, but they still brought a perfect light dessert with candles.  Everything we ordered was fantastic- can't go wrong here.  Especially the service- a combination of super professional and friendly.",

    "text": "Went to Echo & Rig after having walked by it hundreds of times while I was at tivoli village with my fiance. Made a 6:15 reservation, we arrived nearly on time and maybe waited 5 minutes for our table? We were seated on the covered patio and it was lovely, comfortable furniture, pleasant views and several misters that kept it nice and cool though it was quite warm out.   The manager came over and greeted us and introduced himself, welcoming us to our first time there and introduced our waiter, I believe the waiter was Ari and the manager was Jason. Very friendly and though I knew they have a thing for trying to make you feel like family (I had read reviews that mentioned it) it did not come as fake or contrived.   Wait staff was very good, they made sure our water glasses were never less than half full and cleared dirty plates very quickly. Though some could have smiled a bit more, they all looked so serious. Our waiter made a point to ask about food allergies and took the time to explain where they get all their proteins and vegetables, which is always appreciated. He also explained that they do not charge a corking fee if you want to bring your own wine. I know of many places that charge and rarely see anyone bring their own bottle while almost every table that was seated around us had indeed brought their own wine.   Food was absolutely great. They have a somewhat offset up where there is appetizer section but they have \"small plates\" which act as sides and appetizers.  We ordered the portobello fries and they were fantastic. They were crispy and thankfully were not that wet as mushrooms tend to be and the basil aioli was delightful.   My fiance got a rib eye and I had the filet tenderloin. Both were cooked well (we ordered them rare and medium rare) we also got the avocado toast and lamb cigars as sides and we were not disappointed at all. Steaks were tender and juicy and the sides were cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor.   Overall it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be returning soon to try more of the wonderful food.",

    "text": "I rarely give a place 3 stars, but I think it deserves a 3.5 based on 1st experience. I came to Vegas for a mini vacation to hangout with some close friends & family, not really for the nightlife but more for hanging out and good company, so that being said they took me to this fancy restaurant. I've been to 5 star restaurants before with $50 plate menus, so not foreign to the type of environment. Right away we saw several snobbish people, usually \"old money\" material, heads turn as we walked. Just a few groups of snobs, not the whole restaurant, don't get me wrong. Fine establishment but we could sense the eyes glaring into the back of our heads with each step we took. It was ok for me though, always use to classism. We laughed about it. Same story different neighborhood.  Ambiance: A little noisy but not bad at all. Very nice and fancy. They had the see through glass where you could see what the butchers were upto. The balcony over looked the mall and vallet service. Nice touch.  Service. ***BEWARE***Sneaky. Well just our waiter, JASON, and his choice of vocab for the night \"SEXY.\" He kept persuading us to buy the more expensive steak cuts, which were \"SEXY\" and more off of the menu the whole night. Just like a kiosk salesman who oversells a product. Our table found it very annoying. We asked the price per pound for the suggested meat and we asked for the lesser of the two. On the bill he gave us the more expensive cut, and we ordered two of those! It being $210 on the bill, basically half the bill. Wtf. It was good but he changed our order up, ordering the biggest of the two tomahawks.   Before the steaks came out, he was like \"I got you guys my favorite salad as you wait,\" we thought, oh what a good guy until we saw that he added it on the bill as well! We didn't order that sh*t! We didn't even know what it was to even order it! Ha.  The service was split between a team. Jason and about 3 other people. The 3 others we saw the most and did all the work. When it came to paying our check we saw Jason again and he started to compliment one of our friends, shaking his hand, telling him \"I see you a lot here and I got you guys next time...blah...blah...blah\". This was actually our friends 2nd time here. So we paid the check, he thought we were gonna pay him a fat tip for the $350+ menu we racked up due to his \"SEXY\" waiter skills, NOPE!   Out of all the places I've been to this was the most unprofessional I've seen due to him alone. He stood there hovering over us to see what we would tip him and then after signing and tipping he took our bills with the quickness. I remembered I was in mid sentence and then *SNATCH* the bill was in his hands. He crumbled the originals for the customers to keep then rudely said \"I'm missing one.\" We told him we split it 3 ways and he left angry. Like he really deserved a fat tip. As we walked by him he didn't say good bye or anything but had the nerve to talk sh*t behind our backs to his coworker. Very \"SEXY\" of him. So one of my friends said, make sure he's on your YELP review. Got em!  Food: Ok now let me talk about the food. Haha. Very delicious. Very fancy/gourmet. Presentation was excellent. We ordered Calamari, Crabcakes (which Jason hinted to us the whole time), Portabella French fries w/ aioli sauce, and bone marrow. Everything came out delicious.   Our tomahawk steaks came out plate sized humongous. Ordered it in medium, it came sliced and detached from bone, which we devoured the meat on their too. We got 5 different dipping sauces which were unique and enjoyable. The meat was juicy and very pleasing. After a few bites we found it overwhelming and ended up taking the rest home.   I'm Definitely coming back here every year, maybe check up on my favorite waiter. Ha. Service is one of the MOST biggest factors when it comes to trying out new places. It's all about the experience you share with good company.   You only get one chance to make a good first impression! #SEXY  ***Start to look for fake accounts or friends of server popping up trying to hate on what I wrote about this place. This is basically my experience here, everyone has their own.   PLUS, I guess since my other reviews consist of tattoo parlors and snack shacks then this review should be taken with a grain of salt. Ha! SIKE! According to MILEY P. (Fake Yelp Acct, but nice profile pic. Ha. Is it used to attract more yelpers to agree with your review?). The only review she got on her profile and it seems to go against everything I said. Yelper page Created in November of 2013 (the month I wrote the review) Interesting & very Fishy... Ha.",

Our party of four included one E&R veteran. So we let her order and we dined family style. Everything was delicious. Over The Rainbow. Cauliflower. Portobello Fries. Trenne. Rib Eye Cap. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If I can make something that even comes close to that \"Over The Rainbow\" at home, I'll be golden.  I also tried their Gin Gin Echo Mule Mule. Tasty cocktail that goes down way too easily. Their draft beer selection is decent. I followed up with a glass of Speakeasy Payback Porter.  Darren with two Rs and an E provided us with excellent service. We were outside on their patio and it ended up getting very cold. The manager was great in moving us to a warmer part of the patio. Their ceiling heaters are surprisingly effective.  The only downside is that they had run out of the Butternut and Burrata Ravioli. I guess that just means we need to go back.",

The Portobello mushroom fries, octopus, thick cut bacon, and the baked Brie are a must to try! This is our go to place for steak and great food. Service has always been top notch as well. I definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday night with reservations with friends.  The restaurant is located upstairs and the downstairs entry area is pretty cool.  They showcase their fresh and cured meats and the space is very modern and pretty.  They also have an awesome butcher book.  We got seated pretty quickly and there were various people who greeted us.  Everyone is really friendly and nice.  They started us with two free dishes, a quinoie salad and the cauliflower on the vegetable list.  I loved the cauliflower because it was roasted and sweet with a slight spicy kick.  The quinoi salad was fresh but wasn't nearly as good as the cauliflower.  We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and entrees.  A lot of my friends got the ribeye cap, the ribeye cut and I was the only one to get the spencer steak.  We also ordered fries, corn, brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and broccolini.  The vegetables and side dishes were good.  Fries were alright, nothing spectacular or special..but I liked the sweet corn, the brussel sprouts (though i've had much better elsewhere) broccolini and mac and cheese.  The dish i was disappointed in the calamari salad.  There were few pieces of squid and the whole plate consisted of fava beans.  It was tart, the squid was chewy, not crispy and wasn't flavorful.  I think its Mediterranean inspired and it doesn't suit my palate.  Really didn't care for it at all.  The mac and cheese was good though.  Not too cheesy but very homey and hearty.  As for the entrees, everyone enjoyed their steak except me.  I had a bite of my friend's ribeye cute and it was very juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.  I think the cut naturally has a lot more fat so its way more flavorful.  I had the spencer cut and it reminds me of a NY cut.  It was much thicker, dryer, and with less flavor.  It was cooked well but I think i prefer a fattier cut of steak.  Each meal came with chips (mehhh) and stuffed mushroom.  Liked the mushroom but would have much prefered mashed potatoes or a vegetable for a side dish than chips.  Service was very attentive, the food took a little while to come but they gave us more chips to apologize...no one touched it.  They also have this amazing hand scrub in the bathroom.  That might have been my favorite part, that and the company.  Overall this place is a beautiful space, great service, and serves good food if your order right =).",

    "text": "From looking at the other reviews for Echo & Rig, the service here seems to have its highs and lows. I've dined here twice and, luckily, the service has been on the higher end of the spectrum. Now, their schtick here is that they'll trip over themselves to refer to you by your name and it's also likely the maitre d' will swing by to greet you as well. On our second visit, our server claimed that he waited on our table the first time we visited (he didn't). So ymmv when it comes to the service, it might feel a little disingenuous. For the most part though, the waitstaff here have been friendly and diligent.  The lunch/dinner menu here is well-rounded and offers a good variety of flavor, especially with reference to their selection of small plates. I personally opt for the brussels sprouts and the grilled octopus. I'd imagine ordering the small plates a la carte for a meal wouldn't be a bad idea if you're out with a large party. I've really enjoyed the bavette steak (wagyu) both times I've eaten here. Steaks all come with a choice of sauce; I'm a fan of bearnaise.  Never mind the almost cloying service routine, Echo & Rig will likely have me coming back for the food and quick waitstaff.",

    "text": "My girlfriends came to town to visit me for my birthday and wanted to go to a nice restaurant off the strip. I thought of a few restaurants but decided to go with Echo & Rigs because they never disappoint me. The food per usual was very good. My favorites of the night was the portobello fries, the lamb chops and the jumping beef. The lamb chops had a nice crust on the top and was very tender. The jumping beef was full of flavor and as well very tender. You honestly can't go wrong with either choice.   Normally at Echo & Rig I have great service but the waiter that night was so so. We described the kind of wine we wanted and we let him make the recommendation. He brought out the bottle and had us try the bottle but it was nothing like we described. We kindly told the waiter we didn't like it and then he told us, he didn't have us try the wine to see if we liked it or not, he had us try it to see if it was too corky. That was the first time we ever heard of such a thing but we just looked at each other and said okay. That almost ruined our experience but then this nice gentleman name Xavier turned everything around for us. He came to check on our table to see how we were doing and after we explained what happened, he was very apologetic and got us another bottle of wine that fit our description perfectly. Xavier also sent us some dessert that was also very delicious. I would of gave this place a 3 or 4 stars because of that waiter since customer service is very important to me when dining especially at a nice establishment but Xavier really made up for it so this place is getting 5 stars.   I highly recommend this place if you want to go somewhere that's a nice local spot off the strip. The price is very reasonable and the ambience very nice.",

A diverse menu that not only has something for everyone, but has it with a spin that makes it all a bit different from what you had at the place down the street.  The wait staff is friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is bright and cheery, without being cute.  What's not to like?    Yeah, it's more convenient for Summerlin residents than for Strip tourists, but if you drive the few extra miles you get to enjoy the atmosphere of Tivoli Village, which I think is quite nice.  Like Italy, but cleaner.  Definitely give this place a try.",

But don't let the truly luxury prices of that high rise fool you.   Echo & Rig is an amazing value.   This place is a dream.   If I lived in the area, I would eat here everyday.     The menu is set up with entrees as well as a great selection of small plates.   This makes it so easy to share food with the entire party, and have a great time.   I'm not even going to point out what I ordered.   Just ask the wait staff and order anything on the menu.   It's really good... You'll wonder why prices aren't higher.     The personnel at Echo & Rig are all superb.    They immediately check to see if you're a repeat customer, and host you as such.    Their waiters go above and beyond in terms of service and manner.     The wait staff knows the menu and I've found they do well in suggesting plates to try.  So if you want them to just order for you, this is a place you can trust them to do that.    I don't want to hype this place anymore.   Just go try it!     Also, Yelp is wrong in saying they don't take reservations.   Echo & Rig welcomes reservations.",

I got in to Vegas really late on a vacation and went straight here... but the dining room kitchen had closed.  The only thing available was the Happy Hour menu, and what a MENU!  For $1 each, you can select from Steak and Eggs, Shrimp Cocktail and a Gourmet Hot Dog with a nice Cabbage slaw.  You may think this is just a gimmick of crap food to get people in the door and drink cheap beer, but NO WAY!  The cuts of steak are the trimmings from the high quality steak they serve of about 2 oz each, served with a perfectly cooked runny egg.  The shrimp cocktail does not skimp in the shrimp and the cocktail sauce is awesome.  And the hot dog, the humble humble hot dot, is done grilled to perfection.  It is a quality hot dog with a great flavor.  Crunchy casing and juicy as hell.  On a side note, the happy hour beer selection is nothing to scoff at.    I cannot wait to come back here to try out the full menu!",

This time around Derek made our experience more than memorable! Being a transplant from Florida he was more than experienced in recognizing the customers desire for a good meal and service required to keep us coming back. My husband and I are not flashy or well to do by any means, but we were treated as paying customers that were worth the time which was extremely appreciated!  We had the grilled bacon with barbecue sauce which was very yummy, but the sauce was taken away right before our last savory bite. The black and white salad was a perfect combination of intriguing yet comforting appetizer. My husband had the crusted butterfish that was perfectly cooked and complimented with perfectly tasting parsnip. I had the rib eye cap which was flavorful all by itself but even more tasty with the blue cheese sauce, which was not overpowering as it can sometimes be! I would have eaten the entire piece but some was a little more rare than medium. We were also treated (on the house), to cauliflower which I have never eaten in my life but would definitely order again!  I saved room for a couple of bites of the caramel turtle dessert, which was sweet but not too sweet! Definitely loved by my husband who left maybe a bite. Highly recommended by us Vegas locals and we will definitely be back for more!  Needless to say that I highly recommend Echo & Rig for locals, tourists and anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience without all the uptight snobby persona. Real good food for real people, for half the price of the strip!",

Now, in all fairness, my doctor has banned me from eating red meat. I am not a vegetarian, vegan, or health nut. Therefore since I did not try their steaks, my review will be based on my experience of service and hospitality.  My wife had been here before, and just said it was \"so-so\". Why did we go here? Because my first choice didn't open for another 45 minutes, we felt Brio was less than medicore, and the other places in Tivoli were sandwiches, crapes, or Gringo Mexican,  and not real fare for dinner.  We were greeted by a very nice hostess, who took us upstairs, and wanted to seat us near the kitchen. Since the place was empty, I asked if we could be seated by the window. I was told that was \"a table for four\". After I showed signs of leaving, she reluctantly seated us here.  Our waiter, Jackson, started out okay, until we informed him we did not want any wine, and were not interested in alcoholic beverages. The \"air seemed to go out of his tires\", as we were not going to order items that raise the check and the corresponding tip.  After that it seemed like we were \"branded\" as \"undesireables\".  I told the waiter I was craving a large salad. He suggested the Arrugala Salad.  My wife ordered the Crab Cake and Trenne Pasta.  The Crab cake was decent. Better than what is served at  The Palm, and far better than what they try to pass off at The Yard House.  My wife's pasta and meat dish, was \"a cut above\" the Speghetti Factory. Pasta was over cooked, and the accompanying ingridients, an after thought.  My salad was very disappointing. Poor presentation, and very small portion.  Had the waiter, Jackson, said, the salads here are meant for appetiziers, I would have ordered something elese.   We also got a nasty stare, when we asked the food server for more bread.   The saving grace, was the manager, Xavier. Very polite and doing his best to please. When I complained the Salad was not a satisfying meal, as the waiter told me it would be, he offered to take it off the check. Since I had consumed it, I said that would not be fair.   He also offered to have the Chef, \"send something out\", but by then, the cold feeling we were left with by other staffers who looked at us like, \"you're not what we want here\", left us feeling unwelcome.   Xavier is a good person, and tried to salvage the situation, by giving me his card, and telling me to contact him prior to coming back. I appreciated his thoughtfulness.  Again, in all fairness, this place is noted for its meat, not salads and pasta, and my friend Phillip, who I usually agree with, gives it a good rating. However, I was left with the impression that the staff \"judges a book by its cover\".  We were not dressed in designer clothes, and didn't have that trendy look when we walked in. The staff acted like we did not belong, and that's how we felt.  My wife might go back with her girl friends, but after getting the feeling that the staff  was looking at me with the thought of, \"why don't you go back to the Suncoast Buffet where you belong?\", I am done with this place.",

Located in the beautiful Tivolli village, definitely did not look like typical Las Vegas. We decided to go here based on a Yelp reviews, and I don't regret it. It's kind of like a steak house / butcher shop, yet it's sleek / modern. Our server was very attentive, and nice ( recommended several dishes to us newbies ).  Dishes were moderately pricey, but worth it. I definitely recommend the portobello mushroom fries as an appetizer, very hearty! Everything on the menu is al la carte, so you can choose your sides for your main entree. I got the fried duck, which was a little bit salty, but my husband's steak was amazing! Definitely need to go back, definitely worth the price and views!",

To drink, he had a bloody mary, and I had the \"gin gin echo mule mule.\" The bloody mary was described as mild, and my drink had all the loveliness of ginger and herbs. I always appreciate the option of house sparkling water, as well.  Imagining sizes of small plates is always difficult when you order, but this was enough for the three of us. It's about two cups for the potatoes and for the Brussels sprouts, and then one sausage. Plus a basket of bread and butter. We were set.  Our server was outstanding in his kindness.   No complaints. We did get the wrong check ($222), but it was an easy correction, and a little humorous.",

    "text": "Located in a fancy strip mall, this place offers a superb level of service. Having been in hospitality, I really appreciate the effort of higher service here. The hostess took my name and started calling my boyfriend Mr. Chan LOL (also he is not Asian so a little weird). However I appreciate the family environment they are trying to create. Jay was our server who made the experience very pleasant- he was very informative, professional and not overbearing. It was brunch time so we tried the short rib hash, portobello fries and steak and fries. The short rib in the hash was killer tender and braised in house. The eggs were perfectly poached on top and drizzled over the perfectly sized potato cubes. This dish is obviously highlighted for a reason. The steak and fries were overly salted but was quickly fixed and perfected on the second serving. The best part of the wait was a complimentary tomato salad that cleared the palate while the steak was grilling. The chef didn't want only one person eating at the table- very nice touch. To make the experience even better, the manager, Xavier, sent out a salted caramel sundae that was heavenly. Who eats a sundae after brunch? Anyone that is served this sundae in particular. I will definitely be back for a dinner the next time I'm back in town. Thanks Echo and Rig :)",

We enjoyed drinks at the bar downstairs until it was time to get seated. We were seated on the patio  and immediately brought complementary sparkling water and delicious appetizers due to the long weight. The patio was nice but it was a little cold outside. The server was knowledgable and attentive. She offered to bring out a meat plate, but we decided to pass. When we got our food everything looked and smelled amazing. The only complaint I have would be about the St. Louis ribs. They were very dry and Unenjoyable. We were there for a birthday party and after dinner the server brought the birthday boy a complimentary dessert and sang him happy birthday.   Overall the restaurant was clean and well decorated. The wait was pretty long and I was not expecting that due to the fact that we had reservations. I gave this three stars because I would have been much happier eating somewhere else .",

Part of that is the butcher's attached to the restaurant.   I love that you can buy meat here to take home or just rest assured that your steak is fresh and quality.    Price is a little steep but again, high quality food so maybe you get what you pay for.  We spend a fair amount of time at the bar (it's only a problem if it negatively impacts your life!) and I can't say enough good about the staff in the bar.  Stop in, grab a cocktail and check out the happy hour.  Good times to be had.",

    "text": "I'm seriously in love with this place. It's probably my top 3 favorite places to eat in Vegas. Now I heard through the grapevine that Echo & Rig is from the same creators as Bottega Louie in DTLA, and being a native Angeleno, this restaurant is a staple in your life. I have not confirmed this, but the portobello mushroom fries are the same exact recipe to a T. So I'm hoping this is True!!   Typically I just come here and order a ton of shared plates with my crew, so here are my suggestions: Tomato/Watermelon salad, roasted broccolini, asparagus & fried egg, brussel sprouts (these are lemony and light, excellent summer dish), burrata, portobello fries, bone marrow carne asada (brilliant), garlic shrimp. I would not recommend the mac & cheese because it was kinda dry and a little bland. I've also tried the mache roasted chicken salad and the sea bass (sea bass was great, if you like a little salty). For wine I tried the Echelon chard, which was not impressive, but Stratton Lummis \"The Riddler Lot 4\" red blend was excellent!!    I've sat upstairs and the service was incredible. I've sat downstairs @ the bar and the service was incredible. Last night our server was a bit odd, she did mention she was new, so I cut her some slack. But she didn't know which wine was which or what was in the blends. Aren't y'all supposed to be training your servers to know the wine before they serve it? Also, she snatched our ID's out of our hands after repeatedly asking for them when we already had them out on the table, and the third or fourth time she came around failed to ask us if we wanted another glass of wine (when our first ones were clearly finished). I get it - you're new. You're forgiven ONLY because I love the food, atmosphere, views, and music so much.  Echo & Rig = Bottega Louie. Happy native Angeleno Vegas transplant!",

    "text": "2 hour wait. I was expecting a wait, but 2 hours was a bit much. Was it worth 2 hours? Definitely not, sorry to say! I would think that with my hunger and grumpiness I would like anything I ate, but that was not the case.   On a positive note, I liked hoe the butchers were cutting steaks and you could talk to them and sample some sausages and such. Personally, I am not a sausage fan and did not like what they had to sample, but I believe my hubby liked this sampling. I liked the displays of meat and opportunity to interact with butchers.   Once we were seated (pretty area upstairs by the way), I already knew I wanted the rip eye cap and the portobello fries so I was ready to order. Well, come to find out they were out of the rib eye cap!   At that point we had to ask for recommendations. I was a little confused by the steak choices. They had rib eye steak on the menu and rib eye steak that you buy from precut slices that the butchers were cutting downstairs. Apparently there is a difference in the quality of them. There is also a difference in the price, major difference. I just found it weird. I mean options are great, but this was a little bit too much for me to decide. I think they should just stick to whatever they feel would taste the best. The waiter almost made the rib eye from the menu sound like something I could have bought myself at the supermarket. He was really \"selling\" the ribeye/steaks that were brought out raw on a platter. Maybe to some people they would appreciate this and it did remind me of my experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but the prices were almost the same as strip prices for those cuts of meat. It almost felt like we would be making a bad choice if we chose the steak from the menu. Again, why not just have one type of meat on your menu?  He claimed the fish was brought in from fisherman that same day and I did not understand how that is even possible?  Based on the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the slow roasted short ribs with castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, and horseradish. I'm not going to lie, these toppings did not seem like they would go well with short ribs, but the waiter was saying it was excellent so I got it. The olives, celery, and walnuts literally looked like they were sprinkled on top after the short ribs were cooked. I don't think raw celery, uncooked olives, and chunky walnuts compliments short ribs at all! I was hoping it was maybe chopped up small and possibly cooked in some way. I've ordered short ribs often at restaurants and just never saw it made this way. It was presented on a piece of paper and board (similar to how a charcuterie would be served), also weird. I think of short ribs as having a yummy sauce that you would want to pair with mashed potato or rice or something to enjoy the sauce with and some sort of cooked veggies. Instead, the sauce was dripping off of the paper. Weird presentation.   My husband's ribeye steak was good and so was the mushroom. He also enjoyed the bone marrow (I did not try it) and I liked the portobello fries. The waiter was quick to move around and seemed to be good (except for his recommendation).  Overall that short rib and the long wait did not leave me wanting to come back for more.",

Cool looking place with bar, lounge and butcher area downstairs, decent sized restaurant upstairs.  Forgot to bring a bottle of wine to take advantage of the \"no corkage\" policy - no biggie since only three of us drink and I personally was in a beer mood ( later in the meal, when the manager came by to ask if we enjoyed our meal, I couldn't resist, I asked if there's a no corkage policy, why not extend it to beer - as in, can I bring in the \"brown bag.\"  Sadly, manager said \"no\" and her eyes said, \" HELL NO\"  The food ?  overall, a hit.  Ordered:  starters/sides -   $5.10 each : Mashed potatoes w/ white cheddar; cauliflower with crispy onions;   $7.40 each:  Meatballs; Mac and cheese; portobello fries; asparagus and fried egg  $9.20 each: grilled octopus and gigante beans; fried calamari  The starter/side hits ?  the cauliflower, meatballs and Portobello fries.    The misses ? mac n cheese ( very rich sauce but lacked cheesiness and served cold )  and the grilled octopus ( beans , though tasty, overwhelmed the octopus )  Mains-  24 ounce Rib eye, medium ($58).  Very good flavor, properly seasoned about 1\"-1 1/4\" thick, but I feel the steak was closer to medium rare/rare than medium.  Not an issue for us.  Grilled cheese $11.90) - short rib with white cheddar and gruyere - perfect !  Tagliatelle Bolognese ( $12.80) - al dente, delicious sauce but a little light on meat.  black spaghetti ($12.80) - includes shrimp and scallops with a little bit of calamari - great flavor, a little salty but I like it that way.  desserts ($6):  Caramel turtle - I was a little disappointed - guess i'm an old school guy because I was hoping for a prominent caramel sauce - there was a sauce but seemed like an afterthought to the brittle  berry shortcake - loved the berries and syrup ;  the biscuit a little too hard - does it freeze up a little due to the ice cream ??  service was excellent - the food definitely comes out timely/fast.  We like the concept especially the variety in the menu.  we will return",

    "text": "Late review - we had dinner at Echo & Rig 6/12/16 and loved it so much we went back on 6/13/16!!!  On 6/12/16, we were served by Nicholas and Julian.  Service was outstanding!  Ice teas and water glasses were always topped off.  Appetizers were amazing - chorizo  (butcher's sausage), ahi poke and grilled octopus. The chorizo was out of this world, we ordered it both nights.  The grilled octopus was served with beans and green olives, so very tasty!   Ahi poke was fresh!!  For our entrees we had the horseradish crusted butterfish and ribeye. Great choices.   Second night we were served again by Nicholas but his partner was Enrique this time. Again service was perfect!  We enjoyed the chorizo and fried calamari for our appetizers this time. We decided on the tomahawk ribeye and we did not regret it.  Yummy!!!  The restaurant balcony has an sunset view to die for.  If you have a choice, weather permitting, get a table on the balcony.  Both nights we were greeted by the manager, Xavier Dillard.  Xavier was very welcoming and attentive.   Parking:  valet or self-parking.  One note of recommendation:  they do not charge a corkage fee.  Next trip to Vegas, we are making reservations at Echo and bringing our own wine!!!",

    "text": "We arrived for a fairly early dinner (about 5:00 PM on a Saturday evening). When you come in, you are struck by the Butcher shop to your right and the bar area to your left. Both very attractive. We were led upstairs to the patio area. This was an unusual night for Vegas because it wasn't too hot or too cold and it wasn't windy - a perfect night to eat outdoors. The tables were very nicely spaced so you didn't have to hear the conversation of your neighbors. My wife and I decided to share the black spaghetti and a rib eye steak. Because of the rave reviews for their Portabello fries, we decided to give them a try as well. Our waiter let us know the steak would take some time. Not a problem. We told him to bring out the spaghetti first and the steak when it was ready. We waited a pretty long time. The steak came out first, then the spaghetti. The fries came out last. We asked for the steak to be pink in the center. It came out way too well done. We sent it back. It came back a second tome. Again way too well done. However, we decided not to send it back again. Despite being cooked too well for our tastes, the meat was delicious with an excellent rub. Our waiter never did ask us if we wanted one of the sauces available. I only realized it when I heard him offer it to the folks at the next table who were ordering the same steak. Don't get me wrong. The steak was delicious and didn't need a sauce. But it would have been nice to be asked. The black spaghetti was incredible. This was cooked to perfection. There was a good amount of seafood mixed in (mussels, calamari, and more). All in all, one of the best pasta dishes I've eaten. And the portabello fries were incredible. The reviewers who recommended them did not lie. It is worth eating here just for the fries.  At the end of the meal, the manager came out and apologized for the confusion on the meat preparation. We explained that while we prefer our meat much rarer than the way it was served (ie pink throughout), we did eat it and enjoy it. However, he insisted on taking it off the bill. Overall, a very good dining experience. I will return when I am in the neighborhood looking for a good steak meal (or a good pasta dish). If it weren't for the errors on the preparation of the meat, this would have been a 5 star review.",

    "text": "We had our Company holiday party here on Friday, December 16, 2016. We had 20 in our party and the meal and service were just outstanding! We started with appetizers, followed by a salad course, dinner and dessert. The avocado toast small plate, Pork Belly & spicy slaw, roasted mash potatoes with white cheddar, fried spinach salad, Portobello fries, all served with outstanding presentation and taste that will leave you wanting more. I know hard to imagine but there was a unlimited amount provided and this was all a precursor to an outstanding dinner with filet tenderloin steak, Colorado lamb porterhouse chops,  7 cheese Mac & Cheese, and lasagna. Refusing to tap out and having recommitted to my workout regiment the dessert of ice cream with caramel and pecans was the great finisher. Ok I confess I had two desserts, but a co-worker beat me with four. Just a great meal and a great time. Looking forward to the next trip.",

    "text": "Let's begin with...  Small Plates - although Echo & Rig is quite obviously a steakhouse, the menu has an eclectic, yet put-together feel. Steak, salads, pasta dishes, did I say STEAK?, and small plates are found here. Small plates have three price ranges. One could come here and simply eat off the small plates menu, or use the small plates menu to come along as sides with a steak. The variety is good, but not overwhelming. You can tell these items have been selected with the utmost care.  Butcher's Choice Sausage - this sausage changes daily as noted by our incredibly helpful server, Edward. When my friend and I dined it was a chicken sausage, within a pork casing, with a sweet tomato sauce, onions, and jalapenos. This sausage was quite possibly the best sausage I have ever eaten. Cooked perfectly, with a snap to the outside, and a deep flavor without the \"taste\" of your normal run-of-the-mill grocery sausage (that taste is not good).   Carne Asada Bone Marrow - The sausage blew this small plate away. However, it was still good, presented beautifully, and a decent-sized portion (my friend and I shared). Comes with onions.  Moving on to main courses..  As impressed as I was by the brilliant selection of steaks AND the lesson the server gave us about each of the cuts I wanted to order more small plates, however, I was so mesmerized by the cuts of meat available I decided to have the Hangar Steak Sandwich. This comes with roasted Anaheim chiles, spinach, and preserved lemon chimichurri. I certainly picked a good dish as the steak was cooked to a velvety medium, the bread slightly toasted, and all the flavors melding together, plus a serving of crunchy potato chips.  Lastly, dessert. My friend and I chose a chocolate ice cream bowl that came with candied pecan cookies, cherry gelee, and big, ripe, bourbon-soaked cherries, topped with what I know was a freshly whipped-up whip cream. This little dessert was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  Other features... a decent wine listing with wines that will and won't break your pocket book. Service that was immaculate, friendly, yet not too hoity-toity. Our table was also visited by the manager of the night who was a very nice gentleman.  Overall I will absolutely return to Echo & Rig.",

    "text": "Overall, we enjoy this place for a midweek dinner or a casual date. The staff is generally pleasant and personable, while the service is on point with exception of our last visit. I figured that out of 5+ visits, I will not dock it unfairly due to one marginal experience.  Excellent: Bone Marrow Carne Asada Pork Belly & Spicy Slaw Baked Brie in Sourdough The Spencer Steak  Good: Grilled Octopus Over the Rainbow Salad Sea Bass  Underwhelming: Jumping Beef (it's more of a stew with poor quality, chewy meat) Flat Iron Steak Sandwich (poor quality meat)  The menu offers some hits, and is a great place for reasonably priced medium quality steaks. I really disliked the Jumping Beef because I hate stews and that is exactly what it was, but the menu does not describe it as such. The service is generally pretty consistent. The cocktails are well mixed and enjoyable.  We will continue to visit this establishment and take business clients here.",

As we walked through the entrance and up the stairs (being seated at the exact time of our reso) the hostess inquired about our intentions. Whether or not we were celebrating. I informed her that I was gaining a brother in law. She took the information she gained and shared it with the staff. This is not something commonly done throughout restaurants but she took the extra step to make note.  Our server was phenomenal. It was like dining in the Wynn. He timed out our food perfectly, coursing it out and keeping us informed at all times as to what his intentions were. Dining here was an experience in itself, it's as if the entire staff works as a team. As every glass was emptied there was a different staff member removing it from the table just seconds later. When each of us stepped away from the table we came back to a folded linen. When the glass was low it was immediately filled from our bottle. Absolutely impeccable service.   We felt like family. Thank you so much! I will forever recommend Echo & Rig to family and friends!  Xo",

    "text": "I made reservations here for my boyfriend's birthday at the recommendation of a coworker. My coworker and I both frequent Las Vegas a lot and my boyfriend actually works as a chef on the strip. He's quite particular when we go out to eat so I was very careful to do my research. Echo & Rig had great reviews so I decided to give it a try.   When I called to make the reservation, the person who answered the phone was very pleasant and took note that we were coming for a special occasion.  Me being the girl that I am realized we would be a little late for our reservation, so I called to move it back a half hour. Again, another pleasant person answered the phone and made the change, no problem.  As everyone else stated, it was located in a very nice shopping center about 15 minutes from downtown LV.  Our waiter, Nicholas, was finishing up with another guest so the manager, Xavier, came to take our drinks. Nicholas did come, apologized for the wait and took our order, explaining some of the items on the menu.   Everything we ordered was really good. He had a 12oz rib eye, and I ordered the Jumping Beef, filet mignon tips in an amazing sauce with roasted tomatoes,  onions. Anytime he is trying to figure out how they prepared a dish, they have done a great job.   We also ordered the mashed potatoes which, I believe, had 3 cheeses, the mac and cheese and the mussels, which Nicholas recommended we have for an appetizer. The boyfriend LOVES mussels and liked the sauce these were prepared in. The crispy shoe strings fries on top were a nice addition.  Service was great. I remember I dropped a knife and an attendant appeared out of no where with a new knife.  They brought out a wonderful dessert with ice cream, berries and a pound cake for his birthday. The ice cream was very good.   He wanted to give his compliments to the chef, but we were told he was already gone for the evening, but we did speak to Xavier again and let him know we would definitely be back.",

Sounded too good to be True for a nice steak restaurant to have $2 steak & eggs, $2 shrimp cocktail, and $1 hot dogs.  Then they couple that with $3 draft beers.  This is one of the best deals in the city and it's located in high-class Tivoli Village at an outstanding steak restaurant.  The shrimp cocktail could have been a regular appetizer to order off the main menu.  The sauce was delicious and it came with about 20 mini shrimp.  The steak was cooked about medium and was a thin cut, but knowing that it come from the butcherhouse on sight, you know it's solid quality.  The hot dog was literally that, a hot dog, but a tasty one at that.  And did I mention $3 beers?  Come here for dinner.  Come here for Happy Hour.  You won't regret either.",

    "text": "Great dinner at Echo & Rig - excellent food and amazing service from Brian.  Started with three great appetizers... Portobella Fries (very flavorful breading), Tomato Watermelon Salad (nice light dressing) and Lamb Cigars (with pickled onions and Tzatziki Sauce).  Main entrees were the Ribeye (nicely seasoned and prepared), Porterhouse (so tender you could cut it with a fork and big enough for two) and... the surprise of the evening... the Ultimate BLT was amazing.. probably the best BLT I've ever tasted. Of the steak sauces... I liked the Charred Onion best, but the table favorite was Brandied Mushroom  Finished with the Caramel Turtle Sundae... really good, but would have been better without the peanut brittle pieces.  All in all... a great dinner experience!",

Why have twenty cooks and servers if they're all just standing and staring at me while I'm trying to eat. Then when I try to pay it takes me forever to hand my card over. The meats and sauces served also weren't extremely pleasing or satisfying. I'm not amused.",

    "text": "Bottom line:  Eat your next steak here.  Note #1:  there is no corkage fee.  That's right - if you have a bottle of something special sitting around that is begging for the right meal, bring it with you.  Echo & Rig will crack the bottle for you and give you glasses.  Also, you do not get treated like crap for bringing your own bottle.  My wife and I arrived for our anniversary dinner at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  We were seated quickly and were greeted immediately by Derek, the general manager.  He introduced himself, let us know who our waiter would be, and took our drink orders.  Note #2:  Do not let Note #1 get in the way of availing yourself of their cocktail list.  My wife's gimlet and my \"lemonade\" were tasty ways to work off the heat of the day.  Sipping our drinks, we then got down to the business of looking at our menu.  You notice right away that the prices are reasonable for the plates that are offered.  Internally, I breathed a sigh of relief, happy that I wasn't going to pay $60 for a mediocre rib eye.  Our waiter, Jason, came over and introduced the menu.  And then showed us the off-menu steaks.  Yeah, this is where they make their money, and it's well earned.  We selected a 34 oz (2 lb) bone-in Tomahawk steak.  This monster was pricey, but was plenty big enough for the wife and I to split, and then some.  It was our anniversary, and I'm about to re-attempt swearing off red meat (I will fail, but try to keep it to once per month).  More on the greatest threat to vegetarianism ever known (next to bacon) later.  We started off splitting a spinach salad, which was great.  The spinach is flash fried and the salad includes broccoli, cauliflower, onion and a citrus vinaigrette.  It's not the same old spinach salad with bacon bits you are used to.  The accompanying vegetables in the salad are finely chopped/sliced, and what you end up with is an easy-to-eat salad that is very flavorful.    For our tapas/accompaniments, we selected the cauliflower, thick-cut bacon and lamb cigars.  The cauliflower was either deep fried or broiled with mild chilies, shallots and onions.  Very tasty.  The thick-cut bacon was very tasty, so tasty I did not use the BBQ sauce that came with it.  The lamb cigars are like miniature egg rolls, they were good but didn't excite me the way everything else had so far.  We didn't bother with asparagus, potatoes, etc. because of the large chunk of cow that was coming.  The Tomahawk chop was epic.  It apparently is grass-fed Wagyu beef, hand-massaged and blessed by beef monks until it gets led to the slaughter, or something like that.  It had enough of a layer of fat that it got a nice, crispy outside, and deep-pink inside.  It was very flavorful.  You can get a variety of sauces with it.  My favorite was the red wine demi-glaze, which didn't overpower the flavor of the beef itself.  My wife really liked the Bearnaise sauce, which I think is sinful to put on a quality piece of beef, but our marriage continues to survive this and other disagreements.  The texture of the beef was excellent, firm but not chewy.  Steak also came with stuffed mushrooms (the stuffing would make a fine topping for the steaks) and some garlic potato chips (tasty, but I rather would have had another mushroom).  *If* you are going to pay $75+ for a steak, the Tomahawk at Echo & Rig is an excellent choice.  I'd put it up against anything I've had from Morton's, Maestro's or any of the strip steak places.  Note #3:  I think it would take a WWE wrestler to get through one of these chops entirely.  Splitting one of these is a great strategy for a couple. They slice it and make it easy to share.  After we finished all but a few bites of the Tomahawk (it was a struggle, that I must sadly concede to have succumbed to) we were provided a caramel sundae.  It looked really good, but it had peanuts in it so it was a no-go for me.  Note #4:  If you are there for a birthday, anniversary, etc. where you might expect a goodie, you will likely get one.  Be sure to tell the server if you have any allergies (because I didn't do so, I'm not going to penalize the server on being cool and providing us something extra, and I'm sure if I would have mentioned my nut allergy it would have been handled)  To finish off, a couple of cappuccinos.  Well prepared, very nice.  Now, about the service.  Some of the reviews on Yelp complained about the service.  The only thing I can figure is they got sucked into a parallel dimension where Spock has a beard and Kirk is stark raving mad.  Derek, Xavier (restaurant manager) and our server were constantly keeping an eye on us.  And it is readily apparent we do not posses stupid amounts of money.  Nonetheless, they treated us like ballers.  All staff, whether they were directly involved with our table or not, would refill our waters, restock bread, take away used plates, etc. as they passed our table.  The place was packed, and I can understand why.  Great meal.",

The menu accommodates those who want steak and sides but also if you want a salad (steak salad was perfect) or even a sandwich for dinner.  Food I would give a 5/5.  Service was great.  We were there early so that might have helped but everything was perfect.   Brussel sprouts with lemon, mashed potatoes, sweet potato for sides were large servings.  more than enough for the 3 of us along with steak salads for dinner and my husband got a steak.  So glad we finally decided to head to Tivoli.  Saw that the Bar has a happy hour and they have an oyster bar downstairs.   For better weather there is outside dining on an upper terrace.

I was actually impressed on how good this simple dish was. We also ordered the Bone Marrow. YUM!!! Next time, i'll need to order 5 of these!!!  I ordered the Skirt Steak Hawaiian Cowboy for the main course, which tasted just like Korean Galbi! If you like the marinated meats in Korean BBQ, this is the steak for you. I ended up just taking my dinner to-go since i needed some rice, kim-chee, & sriracha with my korean bbq flavored steak.  For dessert, we had the Turtle Sundae. Sooo good! Definitely made up for my disappointing dinner choice!",

When it arrived, the glass had only 3 ounces of sangria in it filled mostly with fruit and some ice.  When we brought it to the manager's attention, she stated that is the correct proportion for their sangria, however she will mention it to the beverage manager.  End of story!!! She lacks the professionalism and courtesy that her station should be willing to exhibit.

Because of the tartness of the zest and the blueberries, the pancakes were hard to eat. I literally had to drown them in syrup to sweeten them up, and I don't like doing that. The star of meal was the bacon and homemade BBQ sauce. I was hoping to have a sweet pancake and a salty bacon combo, but the pancakes didn't come through. Partially my fault, don't go to butcher house and order pancakes. My date said the hollandaise was bland as well. I will come back and have a sandwich, they looked great!

I definitely love going here with people from out of town to show them a local Las Vegas gem.  The first couple of times I dined here, the service was amazing!!!! However, last time I went, it was not as great as it had previously been.  I'm hoping it was just an off-night for the server and will still be going back for more delicious steak!",

    "text": "Amazing!!  I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant that looks like quite a simple set up walking in but low and behold, up the staircase leads to a great dining room with patio seating.  My fiance and I arrived a little early (note, make a reservation!) so we were offered patio seating if we wanted to be seated right away.. Keep in mind, the weather is in the 50's now .. We decided to be adventurous which turned out to be the better option and I'll tell you why.  The patio is heated so not only do you have a view and fresh air, but the noise level compared to inside, isn't a factor at all!  If you're dining with a group of friends, the chatter inside may work for you but if you're looking for something more intimate; like we were, the patio is my recommendation!  We also had a great waitress and very attentive manager which complimented the entire evening.  I always like to see people who are passionate about their jobs, and the two of them were star examples of this.  The restaurant is a little bit of a drive for us but we couldn't have asked for a better evening and will definitely be back .. And will ask for Toni",

Since they don't take reservations be prepared to be insulted as I heard one of the owners, Michael, tell a couple you can leave if you don't want to wait 45 minutes. The previous time there I overheard him chastise a lady with her friends she could leave after she paid her bill because someone told him, she was unhappy with the service. She got her salad during her companions dinner and received her appetizer after the salad. What has happened to keeping your customers happy? Be sure to keep away from the host, Pavlav. He is too busy to help you since he is too busy chasing the girls in tight dresses. Not professional front of the house people. Food is nothing special. Sam has a lot of kinks to work out.",

Tonight is the second time I've dined here, and the food was just as delicious as the first time!!! One of the best things about the place, besides the food, is the no-corkage policy... What?! Craziness that I will continue to take advantage of (just make sure you are proper about it and offer your server a taste). The staff is great as well. Ramon was our server the first time around; we weren't seated in his area tonight, but he recognized us and came to say hello anyway and still managed to sneak in some extra service for us. Even if the food was mediocre, I would still come just for Ramon!!! Why only 4 stars?? Well, I've been witness to just a few minor hiccups, which I'm sure will iron themselves out soon... Really rooting for this place and hoping I can update to 5-stars soon!!",

    "text": "Amazing. The food was fantastic. The portobello fries were so good just order an extra aioli. Get the spencer cut. It's kind of like a fillet and ribeye mix, but don't be crazy, you have to order it medium rare. The horseradish cream sauce and the charred onion sauce were bomb too. The mac and cheese was pretty good and the cauliflower also. Just watch out for the little brown chunks in the cauliflower because it's brown sugar. Beer is draught or can which is fine because they have a good draught selection. The only complaint I have is that the bar is downstairs and the restaurant is upstairs which means the wait staff takes a while to bring you a drink. Downstairs is a butcher shop and a little sandwich stand. Both are pretty cool. The butchers seemed pretty knowledgeable and personable and the prices weren't horrible either. Probably cheaper than whole foods. The hostess was very nice and respectful and fun to chat with. All in all this place is most likely my favorite steak joint and will recommend it to all of my friends. Keep up the good work!!!",

We ordered the smoke rib hash, grilled cheese, steak and eggs, mushroom fries, pancakes, and waffle. The mushroom fries and the hash was the best. It was different and seasoned well. Everything else honestly I have had better. This might be a better place for dinner. My Sunday brunch team said it was not a spot to come back for brunch. Just our opinion.",

We are always torn between going with the tried and True classics and favorites, or branching out and exploring more of their menu. First off, their location is great, area is upscale. The decor and furniture are modern and elegant without screaming 'fancy.' The staff ALWAYS impresses. The ladies at the front are always courteous, and we always appreciate them asking if we're celebrating anything special, etc. They also seem to remember if we've been there before, which is a nice, familial touch. The GM has always made a noticeable effort to make their rounds to their guests at some point during the meal, and it leaves us with a pleasant impression each time - that we truly are valued guests.   A quick note on the bathrooms - beautiful, marbled, clean. They add in their own hand scrub (I believe it's a salt scrub but please don't quote me on that) that leaves your hands absolutely baby's butt smooth and exfoliated.  Our tried-and-True dishes have always been the burger and their portobello mushroom fries with aioli. Our 4 year-old daughter joined us once and they even accommodated her with a cheeseburger and shoestring fries (which *I* wanted a plate to myself, they were so good). We have brought many out of town guests who have had everything from the sandwiches to the steaks to the salads - everyone had nothing but positive, glowing remarks about their meals. The dinner service is spot-on: your beverage glass will never go empty, and the servers are genuinely doing anything they can to make your experience better.  Highly recommend, and I intend to be dining here for years to come!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Echo & Rig but I can't help but feel totally disappointed after having our dinner there tonight.  I had originally wanted to order the rib cap but they were out of it by 7pm on a Wednesday night. Instead, I followed the suggestion of our waiter and ordered the Bavette cut which he said was very well marbled. He also recommended ordering it Medium (which was fine with me since that's how I usually order my steaks).  When my steak arrived, I was disappointed to see that:  1) It was not as marbled as the waiter had mentioned  2) 75% of my steak was medium rare (red, raw, way too bloody).   I notified my waiter and he told me he could ask the kitchen to recook my steak. A few minutes later, he came back with my half eaten steak and this time it looked like a charcoal. When I touched the steak with my fork, I could immediately tell it was still too raw. This was confirmed when I cut into the steak and still saw bloody red. By this time, there was no point to send it back to the kitchen because my steak was already charcoal and sending it back would cook it more but it would probably end up a burnt crisp. When asked how my steak was, I showed him that it was still too rare. He apologized and said that due to how thick the steak was, it was impossible to cook it more without burning the outside. I totally agreed. There has to be a better way to cook the steaks so that it comes out the correct fineness without burning the outside.  The things that did turn out well that night:  1) Friendliness Oc wait staff 2) Beautiful restaurant setting 3) Kale salad 4) Butternut squash",

The service is excellent.   During my visit I ordered the steak and fries, which was cooked to perfection.   I ordered a medium well done steak and I did not see too much pink in my steak, but just enough pink for me to say that they cooked it well . The side of butter hollandaise sauce made for the perfect pairing. The fries were cooked okay.  They were not hard and not to soft.   Another fun note is that  there is a real butcher shop downstairs at the entrance of the restaurant where you can pick up fresh steaks and meat to take home with you.",

Bottomless mimosas for $16!!! I love how they bring out a glass of champagne with a brandy soaked cherry in the glass and the OJ in a small pourer on the side so you can add the amount of oj you would like in your drink. (Because all I need is a slplash for color)   Service is always great and attentive. What I mean is...they always keep your glass full!   The food is great! Some of my favorites are the avocado toast, portobello fries and spinach salad!   Great atmosphere inside and out but I enjoy sitting on the patio when I go! Would highly recommend if you love brunch and bottomless mimosas! Cheers!",

The caramelized onions paired with chili was so good  Roasted Garlic Mash   Mac & Cheese $8.60 -Best M&C I've had ever! Hands down. Cheesy seasoned and delicious!!!  Potato Gnocchi & Pea Pesto - Delicious   Brussel Sprouts - The Fresh Lemon flavor was a great addition  Portobello Fries -I'm not a fan of mushrooms but I did enjoy the Fries. The Herb Aioli is yummy  Barramundi $22.20 - This white fish was very flavorful and fried perfectly. I would definitely order this again  Nearly $80.00 later we were full and satisfied!!!  I'll definitely return",

This seemed like just the place so I made a reservation for three. The venue is gorgeous. A beautiful waiting area where you can purchase meats and various goodies. You are even able to view the Oyster selection and watch the person who's not a player they just shuck a lot. The staircase is topped with a beautiful chandelier. At this point, I'm at a solid 4 stars.  Albeaus was our server. We had never been so I was excited to be greeted with the tray of cuts. That didn't happen but perhaps you have to ask? No clue. And to be honest, although he was a very knowledgeable server the indifference in his service is what bothered me.   Where they really lost me was the timing of our plates. I had the NY steak medium rare, my folks both had the filet cooked medium. My parents loved their filets and I will say that their garlic white cheddar mashed potatoes are an A+. My steak was chewy and fairly flavorless. We had ordered caramelized onions and they came out at the end of the meal, the brussel sprouts also arrived late and were barely seared. No acknowledgment that they weren't on our table and no apologies for the late arrivals. I'm no expert on the elements of fine dining but I was a long time server and a little acknowledgment goes a long way.  For the price and the location it simply didn't meet my expectations.",

Because I was interested in a planned menu, the person said she'd have their events manager call me in the next day or two.  Shortly thereafter, I received an automated email from OpenTable stating that I had a reservation on the date I wanted, even though I had not spoken to the events manager or received any information.     After not hearing from anyone at Echo & Rig by the end of the third day, I forwarded the OpenTable email to info@echoandrig and stated that I did not make that reservation, never heard from the events manager, and had decided on another venue.  The next day, I received an automated email from OpenTable stating that my reservation had been canceled.  No one at the restaurant ever responded to my initial inquiry, or apologize for dropping the ball.  What a disappointment.  As you can see from our previous review, we really enjoyed our experience at Echo & Rig, had raved about it to friends, and were hoping to introduce it to our immediate and extended family to celebrate my parents' anniversary.",

They are very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  We started our meal with the raw bar, trying 2 of each. The oysters were fantastic! Shortly after,the Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli arrived. These are the best things I've ever tasted. The flavor and texture were perfect. I ordered the Horseradish Crusted Butterfish with roasted root vegetables & tarragon pinot sauce on the waiter's recommendation. It surprised me that the meal was so disappointing. The fish lacked flavor and the roasted root vegetables was actually only one type of vegetable. I wish there had been more tarragon pinot sauce as this was the only thing that had great a flavor. Also ordered was the Shrimp & Artichokes. While this meal was good, I wish the description would've mentioned the shrimp was breaded.  I know what you're thinking, this is probably what we get for ordering seafood in a steakhouse... hahaha. You might be right. And if so, I'll update this review. In the meantime, it'll stay at 3 stars for the amazing service and tasty appetizers.",

We opted for the bottomless mimosas ($16) that was served as a glass of champagne with a side of orange juice.  Champagne was topped off regularly without asking. My husband had the short rib hash and I had the fried (!) spinach salad. We would recommend both but will probably order something else from their fun menu. We will return.",

You can either sit inside or outside on the balcony, we would've opted to sit out in the balcony although it looked like there wasn't any room for us. Regardless, the ambiance and decor inside made up for it! Our waitress was Amanda, and she was amazing! Once seated, she asked if it was our first time with them, we responded yes, and she kindly and swiftly went over the story behind the restaurant, and filled us in on the decadent meat they had! She made the four star review into a five! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, and if she wasn't 100% sure she made it a point to go back into the kitchen to get the facts! The menu had a variety of sides, and about five main entrees of meat! I ordered the Spencer Steak with the brandied mushroom sauce, and it was one of the most delicious steaks I've ever had! We ordered the baked sweet potato, roasted broccolini, and the asparagus and fried egg! Every plate we ordered, was wiped clean! There was no plate, or part of the meal that we didn't thoroughly enjoy! I'll definitely be coming back just to get the Spender Steak, as I try the many other sauces they have!",

The bar is located downstairs while the restaurant and open kitchen is located upstairs.   The menu is easy to read, priced affordably and offers an arrange of delicious items, including cool cuts of beef.  We ordered the tomahawk bone in ribeye, what a show stopper! Great for the Instagram feed! We also ordered the famous spencer steak, the horseradish crusted butterfish, the Mac and cheese, the white cheddar mashed potatoes, the portabello mushroom fries, the baked Brie, thethick cut bacon and every sundae on the menu for dessert. Don't judge me.   The spencer steak was incredible. The meat was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and full of flavor. The kind of steak you wish you had more of and salivate thinking about. One of the best I've had in Vegas. Even better then the tomahawk in my opinion, although that one was killer too. The butterfish was just that, like buttah melting in your mouth. The balsamic sauce it was served with made the dish. All of our sides were awesome, the mushroom fries were unique and tasty along with the dipping sauce they are served with.   My favorite sundae was the cappuccino and the peanut butter.   Our server was Ricky. He was top notch. The celebratory guest of our party was slightly demanding and he took care of her needs as well as ours incredibly. The rest of the staff were all wonderful too. We never had an issue with food delays, water refills or separate checks. I'll be recommending this place and I plan to return in the near future to grab a seat on the patio. Thanks for the enjoyable evening Echo!",

The staff was friendly as the manager came out and greeted my friend and myself. Drinks came quickly. Menu was not familiar and believe it or not the prices looked inexpensive to me. I ordered the Waygu filet medium rare and it was scorched on both sides. Also everything we ordered and I mean everything was in desperate need for salt. Maybe because it was Monday and the chef was off is why food was lacking. I saw people send back a side dish of Mac and cheese that looked horrible. Not sure if I will go back.

My father, God knows why, insists on well done steak. When he order the cut he wanted, the waiter politely suggested he try a different cut or have his choice butterflied in order to avoid overcooking on the outside. It was so refreshing to have a suggestion along with an explanation. Often it can feel like you are being pressured into a more expensive cut, but this was the opposite.  The brandied mushroom sauce was AMAZING, as was the blue cheese sauce. Oh and dessert...We don't usually have dessert, but these were delicious sundaes and reasonably priced. The cappuccino sundae wad fantastic!!   We will definitely be back!! You won't be sorry.",

Everything we had was spectacular. Our appetizers were delicious - the bone marrow carne asada and the lamb cigars. Our entrees were perfectly cooked and sides were even better: the spencer steak, the ribeye cap, Brussels sprouts and roasted cauliflower. And finally, dessert consisted of a selection of large sundaes that were great. Our waitress was very friendly, made good recommendations, and brought out our plates with perfect timing. Not to mention that the value you get here is great, and they also have a butcher shop on premises. Lets put it like this - if I lived in Vegas, I would be a regular. :)",

I hadn't remembered the food being good enough to return. Well, I was proven wrong last night.   Made a reservation for 10 people, when we arrived the hostess greeted us, made sure to see who the person the reservation was made under, and then chatted with us as we made our way up the stairs. She asked is we had dined here before, I said yes. Just as we had sat down, the manager came over and asked \"Ms. T.....\" (He said my last name wrong, but I'll let him slide, he was cute) and then thanked me for returning. I thought this was pretty a nice gesture. I asked if they removed a drink off the menu that I had here before called the Hot Mess (it's delicious by the way, if you like Jalepeno type drinks) and he said they would still be able to make it (another bonus).   Onto the food. I started out with the Lamb Cigars. These were so good, I could've eaten a few more rounds and called it a night. But I didn't, I ordered the Horseradish Crusted Butterfish. I had never had Butterfish before (from what I can recall) this was delicious. So moist and flavorful and the potato au gratin was served almost like al dente, it was different than any way Id had them before. Most of my friends had ordered steak, and they all finished their plates clean.   Service and food really made up for my previous visits. I will for sure return again.",

    "text": "What a cool spot in the Valley to have a nice dinner or grab drinks. The two story space is beautiful and modern. I was a little bit scared to try this place out because of the price point I thought it would be, but I saw the menu on Yelp! And it actually is very affordable with most entrees being around the $20-$25 mark and their steaks ranging from $20ish to $40. They even have sandwiches and burgers around $15 so don't be scared!  The first thing I will say is that the service is on point. It got a little relaxed towards the end when the outside balcony emptied out, but really good nonetheless. It wasn't too uppity which I liked. It was an interesting experience having the off menu steaks shown to you on a big cutting board. A little extra and doing the most but I liked it.  I have to say the food was very good. Everything we had was unique to them (scallops with a side of fried lentils) but it still had the feel of a steak house. Even though they literally serve you a side of fries house potatoes with your steak it just wasn't a meat and potatoes kind of thing.  My standout dish I'll tell y'all about was the bone marrow carne asada. Bone marrow topped with grilled steak and an onion salad was amazing. The calamari was also delicious because of the aioli that it's served with.  They do have off menu bone in steaks, but I got the top steak on the menu. I have to say the steak wasn't one of the better steaks I've had- cooked well but not anything to write home about or crave. They are served with a sauce to amp up the flavor but maybe I just haven't found my sauce to steak pair yet. I will definitely stop in just to have a drink and some small plates. The menu is huge and unique enough to want to explore. Maybe I'll try one of their marinated steaks next time.",

Got the green tea which is tropical, refreshing and delicious. Then ordered the fried spinach salad, the cauliflower and bone marrow carne asada.   The bone marrow carne asada came out first and was killer. Bone marrow perfectly cooked. I didn't eat a lot of the onion salad and skipped the bread, but the orange on top was the perfect balance of citrus. Made about 6 bites of marrow, meat, and a few onions.   The cauliflower is amazing. Not sure it's low carb as the topping was fried garlic, nuts and there was definitely brown sugar in it. Delicious.   The spinach salad was great. Fried spinach is one of my favorite foods. I did pull out a lot of raw broccoli, which was tasty, but doesn't sit well on my tummy. Delicious, fairly priced lunch. Will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas next!",

Had a dinner reservation and didn't have to wait long for our table to be ready. The servers were excellent and very attentive. It's located in a nice upscale area of Summerlin and is more of classier restaurant, and you don't have to dress up here. We ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye and split it between the group. We also ordered the Mashed Potatoes, BBQ bacon, and the Asparagus with Egg.  Tomahawk Ribeye: Getting this cut was actually cheaper to get per ounce than each person ordering their own steaks. We split this ribeye between three people and still had leftovers. They cooked it a perfect med/rare and it had lots of flavor. The sauces were all good that they brought out, but the blue cheese was something special. They brought out multiple blue cheese sauces for us at no extra charge.  Side Dishes: The Mashed Potatoes were very creamy and had a good cheese flavor. We had to fight each other for the Thick Cut BBQ Bacon, it was so good we ordered it three times. The Asparagus was cooked tender and was great with the egg.",

The caramel turtle, great way to end our meal as it was not overly sweet. Will deff be coming back!",

Its probably one of my favorite steakhouses in the United Stakes. ha. Me and the boys like having a nice steak dinner before we go out-- its important to have the mind clear and the tummy full before a night on the strip.  My go to at Echo & Rig is the NY Strip - the sh*t is thick!! My boy Ty is from NY and he recommended it to me once, and I was never let down. The garlic mashed potatoes are bomb too, and don't sleep on the calamari.   Proceed with caution vegetarians - this just ain't for you!   -X",

    "text": "Cheaper than the \"fancy\" high end places on the strip and in the resorts for similar tasting or better dishes and variety.  However, the steaks they show you on the steak tray are pricey ex.)     New York 20 oz, 40 something oz porterhouse will be pricey.  $2.59 an ounce.  The items on the menu for they're prices are above average to your typical restaurant, and for the high side it's cheaper, but I think this place is overpriced as a whole  The servers are all excellent in customer service, but keep in mind, places like this specialize in sales.  You really dont want anything here, you're just asked and shown and you say yes and everything's up there.  I recommend this place to steak heads or rich retired older folk in summerlin.  That 40oz porterhouse cost me $110 plus tax for the one steak.  It's good but not that good.  Cauliflower is good but still overpriced imo  Decent selection of wines and drinks but all overpriced.  Typical prices for steakhouses.  Brunch and evenings/night when it's dark on the patio is lovely  Inside interior and decor is minimal and nice  The servers are great talkers and quick but a bit too talkative.  I think this place us an ambiance and locational place.  You got the nice walking area for the mall and a balcony.  For foodies it's a flop.  The food is better at places low key on Yelp and around the valley.  For a steak eater, you'll love it cuz the flavor, choices, and price will be the usual for you.  Young folk on a budget, no.  Retired folk, yeah.  Vegetarians and vegans definitely not.  Health conscious, nope.  This place is impressive with the properties interior design and service.  Also, it's been around for like 6 plus years.  Many businesses dont last that long.  I just wont recommend this place or go here anymore unless its brunch with a group of steak lovers.",

Bottomless mimosas for less than $20 (they keep them coming) or bottomless bloody Mary's for like $22.   I'm a big fan of their lamb chop, steak and fries, their fried eggplant fries, all of it. I have yet to have something I dislike.   And their desserts. Omg. The turtle dessert with the caramel and the crunchy pieces of heaven! My absolute, must have item on their menu.   Overall, highly coming here on a nice day for brunch and sit on the balcony if the weather permits. AND PLEASE go to the bathroom and use the hand salts they have (OMG I NEED THEM) when washing your hands. The main highlight besides the dessert.   A little pricey but so worth the dining experience!",

We sat at the bar area- our bartender was so kind and gave us many great recommendations for our time in Vegas. They had a good local beer selection for good prices, and had three food items to choose from on the happy hour menu. We tried them all- the hotdog was good and so was the steak and eggs. The shrimp cocktail was really odd tasting- wouldn't recommend. Overall, seemed like a really respectable establishment and I'd recommend the happy hour for sure.",

You could tell that it was mostly locals branching there, which was kind of nice. The ambiance was nice with very nice decor. The bottomless mimosas were so good and it came with different juice options on the side - so I could make them as opaque as i liked! The food was SO GOOD. We got the short rib hash, bacon, avocado toast, and the smoked salmon Benedict. All of which were soooooo gooooood. It reminded me a lot of the boutique restaurants in Tampa. Highly recommend and will make the trip off the strip again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "We had a wonderful dining experience at Echo and Rig last Monday, August 6, 2018. The restaurant had great food and their service was just equally topnotch. We knew from the minute we entered the place what we wanted to get, and that is a classic ribeye, but wasn't really certain of what their meat size options are as it wasn't indicated on their menu. And Yelp pictures weren't really consistent with the ribeye pictures either. The server thoroughly explained to us the differences among the steak cuts and ounces we could choose from without asking him. I liked that he was very thorough about it and patient in explaining to us everything he deemed necessary to help us be certain of our choice. He did a lot of talking, but in the end, it was all worth it because we got what we had looked forward to have, a delicious, medium well 18oz ribeye. Both me and my husband had a plate of that with different sauces for each. I had the horseradish while he got the charred onion sauce which were both very good, by the way. We also ordered their mac n cheese, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, and summer corn as sides but all good for sharing too. We needed to box them for take out because of their large portions. As for our drinks, I got a classic, perfectly concocted Old Fashioned while my husband had a Guinness which was surprisingly perfectly poured too. I wish we had room for dessert as I'm sure this place would've had a promising dessert menu as well. And for a wonderful meal like that with a classy, trendy ambiance, their pricing, I'd say is fair and decent. A plus too is their restrooms that looked like that of a hotel's with their own brand of salt scrub free to use, fabric like paper towels, and an enormous, full body size mirror. I wish I took a picture of the restroom which I think is a plus in any restaurant establishment. All in all, I would say that I would highly recommend this place especially if visiting Vegas and would like to dine at a good steakhouse without spending an arm and a leg, like us. It's an easy 5/5 rating.",

    "text": "I was able to book a dinner reservation on New Year's Night at 6pm. I was so excited to celebrate not just a new year, but the first new year as husband and wife. When we walked in the restaurant, I was a little confused. To the right was a butcher shop, to the left a bar, and a host stand with four hosts. We told them we had reservations and one led us upstairs to be seated and gave us menus.  I think I've been watching too many Bar Rescues lately because I just started observing and timing the service. No one greets us for at least five minutes, then some employee came by to light candles on our table refusing to make any eye contact so I assumed he wasn't our waiter. Then another five minutes, a manager stops by and welcomes us, tells us about the concept and hopes we enjoy our dinner. He says he will get us water (yes, that would be great). Then another five minutes and we get water (from some other employee that doesn't make eye contact either or interacts with us). Okay....  Another couple minutes pass by and we finally were greeted by the waiter and I order the Date 17 cocktail and hubs orders the Black N Blu Mojito. It probably takes another 5-10 minutes to get our cocktails and we place our order. Now, I will give them the benefit of the doubt since it was New Years Day! My cocktail was superb! I highly recommend it! I don't think I've ever had such a great drink that had dates!  The hubs and I order the Portabello fries with garlic aioli, House Blend butcher burger and the grilled cheese with short ribs! The portabello fries will not let you down - you need to try it!! Actually, everything was delectable and I was impressed.  When we get our bill, it was less than $60, which I was pretty happy about because the last few restaurants I've been to were more than $60 for two people and the food quality are probably the same.   Thanks for celebrating the New Year with us, Echo & Rig - it was delicious and fun and for that, I will give you five stars!",

Obviously i would come back because they have a fantastic mimosa brunch with a great location and view of the mountains... but wouldn't order the salmon Benedict or the brisket hash i believe it was. Didn't love either one.",

    "text": "I came here with my friend in scrubs:)! Haha. We were hungry for an awesome steak at a local joint, so we opted for Echo & Rig.   At first, the lady who welcomed us gave a bad impression. She didn't write my last name correctly. I don't really mind, but if it's a nice restaurant, they usually address you with your last name. She told me it did NOT matter, but she wrote it on another paper. She wrote it incorrectly, again.   The ambience was perfect. Fancy, yet not too fancy to stop you from getting a good steak in jeans or in my case, scrubs!   When we were seated, the manager, Lisa, promptly asked how to pronounce my name correctly. Again, murdered my name. Anyhow, they serve flat or sparkling water complimentary. My friend and I wanted sparkling water. It took a while for us to order but Lucas, our main server, was very patient explaining the differences of each cut.   For sides, we ordered portobello fries, grilled octopus with green olives and beans, roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Lucas suggested he serve the portobello fries and grilled octopus first. My friend and I were awestruck. Where have we been before Echo and Rig? The grilled octopus was tender and cooked perfectly. The vinegary sauce matches the saltiness of the octopus, green olives and the crunch and freshness of celery. Portobello fries was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and paired with an excellent herb aioli!   My friend and I got the grass fed wagyu medium rare. Lucas made some arrangements for us to taste all sauces. There is a free mushroom rockefeller and freshly made crispy potato chips that came with our steak. The steak was cooked on point! It is good on its own, but my favorite sauces are horseradish, blue cheese and brandied mushroom for a creamier side. The charred onion was my fave for the non creamy side.  Ari, another server, helped us out when Lucas was in another table. He was very friendly and took the time to get to know us.  Got caramel turtle for dessert. Everything was made in house so basically it is outstanding. We also wanted coffee after. We got cappuccino. The froth complements the sweet espresso.   Our bill came out to $123.71 without the tip. I think it was worth of what we paid for.   My friend and I will be back!!! Sharing this sweet spot to people who want to eat great food!",

They will usually bring the cuts right to your table so you can see the selection.  Pick your choice of temperature for the meat and add some sides. It is literally that simple.   We got he tomahawk which was 40oz for $120 (easily split between 3 people). I really enjoyed the cauliflower, calamari and portobello fries as sides. This is an easy meal to come and splurge on.  The restaurant is located upstairs while below is the butcher shop.  Everything is elegantly appointed. The restaurant ambiance is almost a feeling of pure elegance along with a family style dinner. A must eat in Summerlin and you can walk Tivoli village after your meal.",

    "text": "This place is quite a way off the strip but worth the ride.  I would have given this 5 stars but there were two key mishaps that I could not bring myself to give it a 5.    This place first and foremost is a butcher shop as were told by Dylan our server, and it is the only Echo and Rigg.  The atmosphere is hip and happening, and the place has a great outdoor patio area that would be great on a warm night or day.  We started off with portobello mushroom fries and I can see why it's a favourite for so many.  Juicy on the inside and a crispy batter on the outside, not like the tempura batter.  With the creamy dip it's perfect.  For dinner we both had the Spencer steak and side orders of the sweet potato and cauliflower.  All were delicious, I really like the spicy punch of the cauliflower when you bite into a piece of the chilli pepper.  Steaks seasoned perfectly.  However our steaks were not the temperature we asked for, both looked the same, between medium and medium rare, over cooked for my husband and undercooked for me.  For a steakhouse, you need to get the temperature right and because of this I would give it 4 stars as we really enjoyed the meal and drinks (mojitos) and service.    Dylan brought out a birthday sundae, it had coffee ice cream and chocolate bits and  pieces of cake but the cake wasn't great.  It was dry and just not right.  Needless to say we couldn't finish our meal, especially the steaks so we asked for it to get packed up.  And this is where I'm going to give it 3 stars.  They brought out the bag, we took it back to the hotel and when my husband went to open it up, he realized they gave us someone else's steak left overs.  This place would have gotten 5 as everything else was enjoyable.",

Actually, I thought I reviewed that night so I'm surprised I didn't see it posted.  Anyway, we stopped by over the weekend and just made it in time for brunch! It'd had been a while since my last visit and I was surprised how fast I was seated since this place is usually very busy, it's a popular spot in Tivoli Village.  I ordered a cappuccino and ordered for my date and I since he was running a few minutes behind and said to get anything. There was a short rib hash with poached eggs that stood out. There was another steak skillet thing with filet mignon and egg in it I can't remember the name of right this second. I explained I wasn't sure which ones to get and ordering was left up to me, so they brought it out family style so we could share. Also got the portobello fries with the pesto aioli cause they are one of my favorite things from the last time.   Echo and Rig's focus is on the food and presentation, there is a butcher downstairs, as well as a bar.  But what sets them apart is the level of personalized service. I was escorted upstairs to my table and addressed as Ms. Stewart by the staff. This is the only place where this has ever happened. Everything here leaves a great impression.",

    "text": "Echo and Rig EASILY gets a 5/5 stars in my book!!!  I went here with a group of friends and actually came back two days later with my wife and my mom since she was in town.  Located in a convenient location in the beautiful Tivoli Village, Echo and Rig is a two story restaurant/butcher shop. When you walk in, you are greeted by some of the highest quality staff I've ever encountered at a restaurant.  To the right is the butcher shop where they are chopping up meat in front of you and to the left is the bar.  Seating is upstairs.  I chose patio seating under a space heater and the view/ambience was perfect.  The staff here is probably the best I have ever encountered.  From the wait staff to the hosts, to the manager who walks around greeting everyone, service was prompt and extremely friendly.    The food is also very reasonably priced considering the quality.  You can get a huge steak for around 20-25 dollars and I tried a few bites from everyone there who got different cuts and they were all delicious.  The jumping beef is almost like a soup with large cuts of filet mignon and one of the better dishes I have ever tried.    My chicken was amazing.  It came with 2 oven roasted chicken breasts and beans on the side.  Mac and cheese was also amazing.  I highly highly highly recommend giving Echo and Rig a try. This place is amazing and I will be back soon!",

    "text": "After reading the reviews on yelp and other ratings sites I decided to check out Echo and Rig to celebrate my wife's birthday. The food here is simply amazing! We ordered the steak tartare and onion soup with gruyere for our appetizers and the filet and spencer steak for our entrees. The tartare was the best I've had, with the right combination of salt and spices (green chilis cut up) and the soup was simple but extremely flavorful.   Now to the steaks. The medium filet was melt in your mouth quality and char was all the flavor you needed. The Spencer's was equally juicy with a different flavor all together. Both cuts were accompanied with gourmet sauces, that you honestly didn't need due to the natural flavors of the cuts themselves. Wound up using the sauce with the garlic potato crisps they where served with.   The entire meal put a smile on our faces and my wife was extremely pleased with this selection for her birthday dinner destination.   To top it off our server Ari was top notch. He was very attentive and obviously knew his stuff. My wife and I were very impressed with his professionalism as well as his ability to be helpful with our questions. It's not often we review servers by name, but Ari you are the man, thanks for making our trip memorable, we appreciate it!  Lastly, the prices there are very good for the quality of their food. Other places that charge more should learn a lesson from Echo and Rig. Well done guys, well done. You don't have to charge an arm and a leg to appear to be a 5 star steakhouse, just serve great food, your customers will do the rest. We'll be back here for sure.",

    "text": "This was my first time coming here and I truly hope they were just having an off day cuz it was beyond unenjoyable. We arrived at 1145am and were told there would be about a 45min wait but the hostess told us it would probably be less. We said sure, no problem. We were expecting there to be a wait. When they called our name after about 40mins, they told us our table would be outside on the balcony and if we wanted an inside table it would be an an ADDITIONAL 45min! Now, keep in mind...today it is oppressively hot here. So my friend asked what it was like up there and the hostess told us not to worry, there were fans and a misting system. So we agreed and go up there to get seated and we are seated in the far corner of the balcony where absolutely NONE of the fans or misting system reached so we were very uncomfortable. A bus boy then brings us lukewarm water with no ice in an attempt to cool us off. We talked to our waiter and he said he would try to get us a table inside. At first he came back and said it wasn't possible since the tables inside were all reserved. So then a manager comes to our table and we talked to her and voiced our complaints...honestly, if when we first arrived, the hostess would have informed us that all the inside tables were already reserved and that the only availability as for outside, we would have gone elsewhere. So then the manager left and came back quickly and somehow found a table for us inside. We get seated and then they actually gave us cold water with ice in it, finally.  It took about a half hour to get our waiter to place our order and when the food came, my food was luke-warm at best and pretty over cooked (I got the short-rib hash). I informed the manager and she offered to bring me something else (I then asked for just some scrambled eggs and toast...not that great)  While we were sitting, it was very hot and stuffy inside and I mentioned it to our waiter and he informed us that the a/c was broken yesterday and it's not working well today. A few mins later the manager came over and actually brought a little desk-type fan to place next to our table, which was greatly appreciated. Towards the end of our meal we asked for the check and it took about 25mins to get it. The manager actually sent us out a free trio of desserts, which was a very sweet gesture. She did also comp my portion of the meal, since I barely ate it.   I hope if I return, that the experience is much better cu this turned me off to a place that I've heard such great things about.",

    "text": "Can you say absolutely AMAZING?! Echo & Rig is an upscale steakhouse located inside Tivoli Village. I had the pleasure of being treated this past Sunday to brunch from my best friends to celebrate my birthday. After doing a bit of research on this place prior to arriving I decided to book a reservation. This is a MUST especially on the weekend and even more so on a Sunday. The popularity on the Sunday brunch is crazy busy. They connect with opentable so if you prefer to reserve on there you can and or through the restaurant website/call in directly.  Upon arriving my party was greeted immediately by the two lovely hostess who stand up front. They confirmed our reservation and even wished me a Happy Birthday! So thoughtful. From there we were escorted up the stairs to nirvana. No I'm kidding but it sure felt like it. You can't help but notice this most beautiful chandelier as you are making your way up. Impressed already from the decor and ambiance of the whole place I was sold and haven't even sat down to eat. Usually places like this are super elegant but the service and food doesn't match. Usually is an operative word in this case because the exact opposite was provided. Not only was the food great but the service was impeccable! One of the manager's Beth came over not even after 5 minutes into us being seated to personally come over and introduce herself and again wish me a happy birthday! So thoughtful I was blown away. Our waiter was awesome to he made some excellent suggestions for starters and walked us through how the bottomless mimosas worked here. And hey... if you are like me and can't say no to a great mimosa do yourself a favor and indulge into this $16 never ending champagne and orange juice river!   Starters: Avocado Toast & Maryland Blue Crab Cake  Food: Two orders of Short Rib Beef Hash & Eggs Benedict  Everything tasted great! We all were so quiet because that could only mean one thing? Yeah we lobed our food lol. The Short Rib hash was prepared so good and I literally finished my whole bowl. I always have leftovers and today my stomach said NOPE be a pig so I did :-) There wasn't one dish that was placed on the table that wasn't good! I ended my brunch with the birthday ice cream that they provided and again just delicious!!! Shout Out to Manager Beth and the Echo & Rig team for providing such a fantastic experience for my birthday! I will be back very soon!",

The hostess asks all the right questions while you journey up the stairs to the dinning area.  With that information you are greeted after you sit down by who I assume is the floor manager.  He graciously welcomed us and knew who was local in our party and that I was visiting from Vermont.  The entire staff was very attentive and I think we had about a half dozen people taking care of our table.    Everyone in my party was very happy with their meals.  Everything is farm to table, but pretty straight forward for a steakhouse.  There was only one thing I was missing and that was a wedge salad, which I always love to start off my steakhouse experience.",

This time we saw the amazing review for Echo & Rig and were so excited to try it out.  A butcher inside the restaurant?  This place must have great steaks.  The restaurant was very nicely decorated.  Our waiter Hugoman was very nice, we felt bad asking him to repeat a few time what he was saying because he spoke at the speed of 200 MPH and the restaurant was very loud we could barely catch what he was saying.  We had the Caesar Salad-good...Fried Portobello Fries-good...Mashed Potatoes-fair...Mac & Cheese-Good.  We also ordered the Classic Filet Mignon, Classic Ribeye (To be shared) and the Ribeye Cap.  When they brought out the steaks the Classic Ribeye was sliced to about 8 pieces, we were beyond disappointed because we ordered a STEAK.  We wanted to cut it piece by piece as we're eating it.  As we all cut in to our steak no one said anything until I broke the silence, \"My steak is cold.\"  At that time everyone at the table broke silence and said \" So is mine.\"  The outside of the steak is room temperature and the inside is cold to the touch.   I am being extremely generous by giving this place a 2 star rating.  The only reason they get 2 star is for the decor of the restaurant, their sides and salad was good and good customer service.  The steak we didn't even finish and we were starving coming in.  The thing I was most disappointed in  is this was a very special occasion and our entree was so disappointing.  We will not be returning for a steak dinner.",

Izzy the server was a rock start and accommodate our 8 month year old and made us feel like part of the family.  Portobello Fries were delicious and what a fun side dish.

We were told that is as cool as they could get it,  that it is not working properly.  She offered to bring a fan over which she did when we were on dessert.   If the ac wasn't  working we should have been informed of that when we arrived.  The heat was really unbearable. We didn't ask for anything but it was really disappointing that the manager didn't comp anything off the check for the  inconvenience.

    "text": "Five of my family came here for a birthday. The difference between this time and the first was that my brother was with us which meant I had a partner in crime to attack one of the bone-in steaks, which we did relentlessly. The fantastic steak, along with stellar service made for quite a memorable meal.  Seated immediately in a round at the top of the stairs for our 8 o'clock reservation, the manager greeted us and we ordered drinks. The Duck, Duck, Goose from their award winning bar was a fruity drink with some punch to kick off the meal. The menu was about the same from our last visit two years ago and no specials were being offered by the chef that night which are options that might need to be considered by the restaurant for those who want something different every visit. For me, just give me quality Double R Ranch/Snake River Farms beef every time.  Our server Luke was an exceptional guide throughout the meal, friendly (especially to my daughter and able to make her laugh) and knowledgeable about all food and drink. He actually helped us tilt the bone-in tray toward one tomahawk as we were teetering between two by pointing out how the marbling was more pronounced in one of the cuts compared to the other. His recommendation to have the thick cut cooked medium to assure a medium rare center and to have all the fat rendered through the steak, guaranteed that we tasted every bit of the sublime flavor. After requesting a recommendation of a cab to pair with my steak, two taste samples were brought out so I could decide.  We were also informed that a shipment of Mer Bleue oysters had arrived earlier that morning and there were only 20 were left, so a dozen were ordered immediately. The Canadian oyster definitely had the salty East Coast start, but a surprisingly sweet West Coast finish. The small plates are a definite strong point of the restaurant and we had a total of five to sample from throughout the meal. All food was brought out in a timely manner and all seven of their sauces were brought out with the steak. I didn't delve into the sauces too much, but my brother did and he said the mushroom sauce was the best. We finished off the meal with two caramel turtle sundaes.  Service has never been an issue with us, but I could see how it might present a problem at times because the servers don't work in teams of two and if one server gets caught up at one table, other tables might suffer because of a lack of availability. Price for the meal was $350 before tip which was reasonable with the numerous small plates and drinks ordered, but a price point much less than if we were on the Strip. If you're into meat like me, you'd make a wrong assumption that restaurant with a butcher downstairs wouldn't serve you quality product. Your server will be a valuable resource to guide you if you let him or her know your preferences. I will use that resource the next time I'm back, and I won't wait this long again.",

    "text": "This restaurant has been on my radar for a while now, so I was thrilled when my husband said that it sounded like the best option for a special night out.  I called and made a reservation for our second wedding anniversary, which was quick and easy.    On Monday night, we arrived a little early, and were seated right away.   Echo & Rig is not only a swanky, elegant restaurant, but it is also a butcher shop.  I absolutely adore this concept.   We were checking out the meat display when a hostess asked us if we preferred the stairs or the elevator.  We opted for the stairs, and I thought this was really nice of them to ask if there was a preference...it shows that they are looking out for their customers who may appear to be able bodied, but have problems walking or climbing stairs.  The hostess wished us a very hearty happy anniversary.    When we were seated, the manager came over and also wished us a Happy Anniversary.  Talk about attention to detail.  Everyone we interacted with that night congratulated us and wished us a happy night.    Our server Hugo arrived and took our drink orders.   We ordered the \"Sweet Passionate Love\" (for me) Nolet's Dry Gin, lychee liqueur, Green Chartreuse, , fresh passion fruit & lime juice, citrus soda.  This was perfection.  I absolutely loved every last sip.  Light and refreshing, I was actually quite surprised, since I'm not usually a gin fan, but this sounded too good to pass up.  I'm glad I ordered it.  It was wonderful.  We also ordered the \"Black and Blue Mojito\" for my husband.  He's a huge mojito fan.  Atlantico Platino Rum, blackberries, blueberries, fresh mint, fresh lime juice, sugar.  This was a lovely mix of sweet and tart, and was really a great drink.    Hugo was, in a word, incredible.  Attentive.  Prompt.  He went over the whole menu with us, answering all of our questions, making suggestions.  Service is always a deal breaker for me when it comes to dining out, and this was no exception.  The food was wonderful, but the service really sealed the 5 stars for me.  From Hugo, to the food runners, to the manager who seemed to be very hands on, and checked on us and several other tables frequently, its obvious that the staff takes pride in their work and want for their customers to enjoy every moment of their experience here.   Now, the food!!!  We opted for 3 small plates: Grilled Octopus, Gigante Beans & Green Olives:  tender cuts of octopus.  Delicious.  Whatever sauce this was in, I want to drink it.  The beans were amazing!  Every element of this dish was great. Crudo, Diver Scallop, Tangerine, Asparagus, Cilantro.  Raw scallops?  Sign me up.  Something we normally only get at sushi, I'm a huge fan of raw scallops.  This was light.  It was refreshing.  There was a tiny hint of spice that I'm honestly not really sure where it came from, but what a delightful appetizer.   Mac & Cheese.  You knew I had to order this.  Being the mac & cheese snob that I am, we almost didn't order this, but decided to as the first 2 small plates were very light, and we knew we'd have room.   This is a 7 cheese mac.  SEVEN. CHEESES.  Of all the mac n cheeses I've tried out there, this one is second ONLY to Gordon Ramsay's truffle mack at his steak house.  The noodles were perfectly cooked.  It was creamy and cheesy.   For me personally, it could have used just a tiny pinch of salt, but that's just being nitpicky.    For our entrees, we had:  Barramundi (for me) flash fried, spring onions, fresh peppers, sprouts, Ponzu.   Is it possible to be in love with a fish?  I'd only heard of barramundi one time before:  Saturday watching \"Hell's Kitchen.\"   Its a very hearty, meaty fish, with a wonderful flavor.  It was cooked to perfection, and paired really well with the peppers, onions and sprouts.   The ponzu was delicious.   Seriously, one of my favorite meals ever.    My husband ordered the Bavette cut steak.  Hugo recommended having this cut cooked to medium, as it is a highly marbled cut, and he said that their cooks tend to lean towards the rarer side of the temperatures.  We took his recommendation, and it was perfect.  Well seasoned, cooked to perfection, it was tender and delicious.    The mushroom Rockefeller was a nice touch.  We weren't super impressed with the garlic chips, though.  It seemed just a touch...under elegant, if that makes sense.   They're actually pretty tasty with the horseradish cream sauce.  We tried that and the brandied mushroom sauce with his steak.  They were both incredible, but the mushroom sauce was a perfect  pairing.  We ended the night with a complimentary sundae, the Caramel turtle, at Hugo's suggestion.  It was delightful!  Definitely a great ending to a delicious meal.  Echo & Rig, you've stolen my heart.  We will most definitely be back again.  Thank you for making our anniversary even more special and enjoyable.",

    "text": "We came to far to be treated like we didn't belong.....  One of my good friends, put our trip to Vegas together to celebrate her mom's birthday and Mother's Day. We went here last Wednesday evening, May 16, 2018, to culminate the birthday celebration. We should have known from the beginning that the evening was not going to be as special as we hoped. Reservations were made about 2 weeks in advance. Now in my experience when you make reservations, it doesn't generally take 30 minutes for you to be seated once you arrive. This was the case here, our table was not ready and we waited. Once it was finally done, we were taken to our seats. The patio was beautiful and the weather was pleasant, so that was okay. Our waitress, who I believe was named Amanda, was good at what she does. She was able to explain the menu choices and even give you a description of what you may want to order.  Everything was going along ok, guess you could say, until I began to notice that one of the managers, Derrick, a young white male, would come out onto the patio and check out our table. He did this about 4 times every five to ten minutes, until he decided that he would go around and introduce himself to every other group seated. I watched him, bring bread, taste wine, help sing happy birthday and even assist one couple with putting their baby's carrier on a stand. Mind you he still hadn't spoken to our table. All of this went on for about an hour or more until he locked eyes when my friend's mother and aunt. Even then he still tried to act like he didn't see them. They kept their gaze until he felt so uncomfortable that he had no choice but to speak. That lasted for all of 2.5 minutes. He then went back to ignoring us and slinking about trying to watch our table. If it hadn't been for how he treated it us, I may have given this restaurant at least 3 or 4 stars, but I don't reward unfair treatment. I made sure that I let the other manager know that we were not pleased with being treated like we don't matter or are invisible. My food was good, but I don't think I'll ever want to go back there when I visit Las Vegas. There were",

So charred it looks all black. They try to bring it to you sliced, to disguise burtness - the garlic chips are potato chips that are dehydrated and taste like tree bark - actually I don't know what tree bark tastes like - but I never wanted to find out :)  The restaurant looks like a high end cafeteria  The clientele was suburban mostly and not with high expectations reflected in their past good ratings.

    "text": "Who said good food is only on the Las Vegas Strip? Echo and Rig is a butcher/restaurant that delivers for carnivores and herbivores alike. We chose to check this place out for brunch as we were staying in the Summerlin area. The butcher and bar are downstairs and upstairs is the main dining room and patio. It has a very open layout and modern rustic decor. L chose the short rib hash. This dish was composed of finely chopped potatoes, onions, bell peppers, short ribs and 2 poached eggs. It was topped with a hollandaise sauce and paprika. The short rib was tender and flavorful and paired well with the eggs. L did not care much for the red and green bell peppers, but this is more his personal preference. J tried the blueberry ricotta pancakes and a hot chocolate. The pancakes were light, fluffy and delicious and were accompanied with a blueberry syrup. The hot chocolate was very smooth, not to sweet and made with full fat milk. The waitress explained \"we only use full fat beef from full fat cows hence the reason for the only milk choice\"   Both of us enjoyed our breakfast and were happy we didn't have to venture to the strip. We agreed we would try dinner here on our next trip.   *Note we would have given this restaurant 5 stars, however the air conditioner was out on our visit and it made it a bit hot and stuffy. In the future we would recommend the hostess advising guests of this issue prior to seating",

The hostesses were sweet and suggested we grab a drink while waiting for a table since we were a few minutes early.   We sat down at the bar and the staff showed us the drink menus -- great wine and house cocktails. We barely got our drinks before our table was ready. They were fast!!  Once we got to our table, we were greeted by the team (!) of people helping us out. Our waiter, Oscar, was amazing. He helped us navigate the menu and gave great suggestions.   We had rib cap steaks, baked Brie, gnocchi, and Brussels sprouts. Everything was amazing. Oscar also helped pair it with a great bottle of wine. And the steak. Wow. Just wow. So delicious. I savored every rich and delicious bite.   To top it all off, they offered me a birthday sundae. Turtle!  The perfect ending to the meal.   The best part?  Totally reasonable prices. Considering the caliber of food and the impeccable service, best bang for your buck in town.",

Starting with excellent customer service coupled with their amazing steaks and gourmet small plates, this place has something for everyone. The staff are always very polite, professional and make you feel like a VIP from the moment you arrive. We always order at least one or two of their amazing steaks and a wide selection of small plates for everyone to share. My personal favorite is the octopus which is the most tender I've had in any restaurant followed by the lamb cigars and portobello mushroom fries.   I'm always excited to take new people to Echo and Rig so they can experience a 5 star steakhouse without breaking the bank. I've been here at least 10 ten times and it's always been amazing.   My hats off to the creators of this menu!",

First impressions were that I was a mere plebian inside a palace....I was under dressed.  I was nervoulsy fidgeting at my oversized target cardigan when the hostess greeted us.  She seemed to not mind nor did anyone else mind that I was under dressed.  We got seated within five minutes and as soon as we sat down we were greeted by our waiter.    Now, the service was amazing....like....I'm sure any mistake cost a waiter or busboy a days wages...or a finger.  My husband dropped his steak knife and as soon as I noticed we had a new one at the table.  It was great!    The food was amazing.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  The best steak I've had in Vegas hands down.  We also got the salt and pepper fries which were amazing as well.  We had a few cocktails during our dinner (probably why we enjoyed it so much) and we ended with dessert.    Now, let me get to my favorite part....the bathroom.  I walked in and literally felt like I was in a spa.  They had a handscrub......a handscrub!    Yeah so great food, awesome service, and handscrub.",

    "text": "Oh Echo and Rig, what a mess. My boyfriend and I went out with another couple here to celebrate my birthday and our friends birthday, we were supper excited after hearing them brag about how much they love this place. Upon arrival, the hostess was really friendly and accommodating. Immediately after being seated, we looked at the menu for about 5-10 minutes before anyone ever came over, weird but whatever. A manager (Kevin) came over to greet us and wish us a happy birthday, it was very nice but this is where the mess started. He ended up oddly asking what kind of water we wanted and started our appetizer order, which seemed weird because up until this point no one had come over and done the traditional \"Hi I'll be your serverthis evening what can I get you to drink... etc.\". Whatever, thought he was being nice and getting us started. After he left the table we sat for probably another 15 min without anyone coming over to say they were our server, what drinks we wanted, if we wanted to order dinner, nothing. We genuinely thought we didn't have a server. Eventually a girl came over nonchalantly and started talking to us as if she had been our server all night, no \"Hello my name is ____ and I'll be taking care of you\". She just walked over and asked what we wanted for dinner.... we all felt super awkward and asked if we could order some sodas or wine or something since no one ever even took our drink order. After she walked away, another server came over and said he'd be taking over the table as our server.... okayyyy so who was the other girl? The whole night it felt like we had no designated server, it was hard to place any kind of order, and the entire dining experience felt like a disaster. I ordered the ribeye and I was not a fan. The outside was very charred and tasted burnt. The steak itself was extremely salty and was cooked more medium than medium rare. Our apps and sides (calamari, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, octopus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon salad) were all mediocre at best. They brought out two ice cream Sundae's for dessert and they looked like a mess, it felt like we were 5 years old at  IHOP with these two ice cream sundaes. I mean the ice cream was good but i would have liked to see a dessert menu or something, I get they brought the desert out for our birthday but wouldn't you ask what someone wanted or show us a dessert menu and let us pick something, I don't care about it being free I'd rather just pay for something I want. Overall, this place was a huge let down. Even the other couple we came with, who are regulars, said they were really dissatisfied with the service and said this was not how it usually was. Definitely would recommend to skip Echo and Rig if possible.",

Their meat is all sourced from well known farms that pride themselves on their beef.     I've eaten at many high end steak houses that are a lot more expensive but still don't match the service or quality of the beef served here.  The ribeye cap is my favorite and is hard to find even in high end steakhouses.  We particularly like the cauliflower side and order it every time.  Tonight we tried the caramel turtle dessert at the waiter's recommendation and it was as outstanding as the meal.  I highly recommend Echo and Rig for your next LV steak dining experience!",

Located at Tivoli village you can valet upon entering or self park which is a short walk. We made reservations and I'm glad we did, this place was busy! The formal dining area is upstairs and they have outdoor seating if you prefer.  -Their menu offers plenty of appetizers and and sides to go with your dinner and if your not here for the steak there are plenty of alternative options. Prior to ordering the server brings out some select cuts of meat. They looked very good but I had my mind set on the rib eye cap.  -The rib eye cab was a perfect medium and had the right amount of fat, would defiantly order this again. I tried my wife's Filet and it was also very juicy, packed with flavor. Our server brought out a few of the side sauces to try, I enjoyed the lemon Chimichurri and the Brandied Mushroom. our sides were the garlic mashed potato and the  asparagus topped with a fried egg and parmesan. Excellent service and very reasonable prices, I look forward to trying a few other menu items here on my next visit.",

We already have enough divisiveness in our society and if my wife, family or friends cannot be treated any better than what was explained to me, perhaps everyone should know.

The short rib grilled cheese is my personal favorite, but the steak and the mac and cheese are also great. I only wish the chips they served had some flavoring.  I am also a big fan of ice cream, and their caramel corn sundae is great. They did change it, though, and it used to be a little better and a little more worth the money.

My girlfriend and I split the tomahawk steak along with garlic mashed potatos, brocollini and asparagus.  Everything was really good.",

    "text": "30 minute wait for a patio table on a Thursday.  We thoroughly enjoyed pretty much everything we ate, but the standout by far was the delicious \"Grilled Octopus, Gigante Beans, Green Olive Vinaigrette\".  We ordered this as an appetizer while waiting in the bar.    It was so good that we ordered another one as part of our meal.  We sat in a nice corner table on the upstairs patio, which is where I'd recommend sitting if you want something on the somewhat romantic setting;  the atmosphere inside was too open and felt more like a place for a group dinner.  Their specialty cocktail with jalapeno was disappointing to say the least; it tasted like a ton of sweet and sour mix with a dash of spiciness thrown in....the flavors didn't meld (I was hoping something more like The Spicy Pear cocktail from  the Union Kitchen & Tap Room in Encinitas; now that is a specialty cocktail).    I'd definitely recommend this place, but I personally would steer away from their specialty cocktails.",

    "text": "I owe them a review... I failed to review them after my first visit somehow and after going again this week and now realizing I didn't review it before, I felt it necessary to make up for it. Echo & Rig has won over many fellow Yelpers and locals alike and you can count me on this list. At first, I was skeptical about the location as every time I go to Tivoli Village I feel like I'm being punked and there are really hundreds of people there who are going to jump out and do a flash dance.... sadly, it's just empty streets. Yet Echo & Rig was packed the first time and had a nice crowd the second time I went. I won't bore you with stories of delicious steaks, fantastic sides and tasty pasta dishes. .. instead I'll focus on the service which has been excellent both times. Coincidentally, we sat in the table right next to the one we were at the first time which put us right near the kitchen. I love being next to the kitchen where I can enjoy first hand watching the artists at their craft. But back to the service... very attentive, helpful with menu choices and not overbearing. They've cracked jokes, shaken hands and provided my friends and I with one very memorable prank on a table of friends dining nearby. We had a hiccup with the bread on our first visit but it turned into a funny memory more than anything for the simple fact that we asked about 3 or 4 different people for bread and each told us it would be right out as they had fresh stuff coming up. And each time someone else seemed to grab the bread before our guy was able to. He absolutely made up for it though and I'm happy to report that on our next visit the bread came out right away. If you have not made it to Tivoli Village yet or have and were also afraid you were being punked... make it a point to go back and enjoy a meal at Echo & Rig. You can thank me later.  Thus concludes my story... thank you... goodnight.",

I go for the short rib dishes for brunch -- either the Short Rib Hash when I'm feeling like breakfast or the Short Rib Grilled Cheese for lunch. For dinner, the entire menu is killer and you can get an awesome cut of meat for a really great price. I've never had a side I haven't drooled all over either. AND pro tip: NO CORKAGE ON WINE! Ya heard right, sports fans! Do yourself a favor and jaunt across to the Total Wine in Boca Park, pick up a nice bottle of vino (or two or three) and bring it in for dinner! There's an extra would-be corkage fee tip for my server right there! The staff is always wonderful and they go out of their way to make sure you feel like the most important customer. Sitting inside is LOUD for sure, but it's nice ambiance. The balcony is absolutely great if you're looking for a little quieter. GO, GO, GO you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Amazing! The meat case at the front is impressive! I have wanted to try this place since a pal of mine, Jason, starting working here as a Chef. I have heard/read mixed reviews. The most recent article I read was in the Desert Companion magazine. After eating here, I find the magazine's review offensive. The nice young lady at the front told us it would be 30-40 minute wait. We made our way to the bar where Scotty was waiting to take care of us. He was OUTSTANDING! Knowledgeable, friendly, and entertaining. I can't even tell you how long we waited bc we didn't mind, We enjoyed our time at the bar. Sangria made w/Sav blanc so it wasn't too sweet. Kentucky peachtree was a little herbal for my husband, who is a straight whiskey kind of guy. Admittedly we were a little sad when our table was ready, Scotty said next time we could eat at the bar with him. Prices at the bar weren't bad, 1can beer, one glass sangria, one shot whiskey, one Kentucky Peachtree and a glass of wine, $37. So glad we went to the table. Our service was on point. Ramon brought out a plate with raw cuts of meat to explain the menu and help us with our selections. We ordered nearly one of everything. He asked how we would like the meal timed. We chose to go with \"whenever its ready, bring it out.\" As we received our dishes we slowly realized we may have over done it. Anyway! What we ordered.... just my husband and I....  and our rating(1-10), don't judge, we like to try everything! Small plates-  Tuscan kale-9, perfectly seasoned, Asparagus & fried egg-11 the asparagus had slight grilled char that was perfect  with the creamy egg,  Mac n cheese-11 soo cheezy it was wonderful, Steak tartare-favorite! Salty, fresh, quality ingredients you can taste Fried calamari-7 light breading very fresh Crab cake-5 plenty of crab but not my favorite crab cake (im a cc snob) Butcher's sausage-7 a little spicy but tasty Brussels sprouts-9 lemony fragrant and fresh Steakhouse Chop Salad-10 big chunks of filet lightly dressed PERFECT Spencer Steak-10 Meat was perfectly cooked tender and juicy I will be back to this restaurant VERY SOON!! Thank you Scotty, Ramon and Jason for a memorable date night!!!!!",

Our server referred to us by name throughout the night, and the food was amazing. We both got different cuts of steak, and garlic mashed potatoes.

We have had some very nice meals at restaurants on the Strip, but I definitely prefer the more local feel of this place. After telling the server what type of flavor I enjoy when I eat steak, he suggested a cut of beef that I typically wouldn't order at a restaurant; a skirt steak. It was a brilliant choice. I also tried the mac and cheese and it was incredible. The texture and taste were perfect.   We ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck recently and it's not even close between the two: Echo and Rig just made better food!",

    "text": "What an awesome dining experience. We walked in (party of two) on a Thursday night just after 5 pm and the restaurant was quiet, as was to be expected. We were greeted almost instantly to get our water preference and then greeted by another person (I assume the manager) to welcome us to the restaurant. THEN we met our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable and had a lot of good recommendations for us. He was very attentive.   A few outstanding points...  The quality of food for the price is outstanding. My boyfriend and I have dined at some very expensive places in California and on the Strip, and Echo & Rig's quality rivals them for a third of the price. I got the filet, my boyfriend got the tri tip, and both were exceptional. We started with the brie, which is essentially brie in a bread bowl - I am more of a fan of the traditional baked brie (a la Mon Ami Gabi) but it was still delicious and the fruit paired with it was very tasty. We ordered roasted carrots as our side - again, delicious.  We ordered Arnold Palmers to drink and the assistant server (not the main server, I'm sad I missed both of their names) made sure to keep them full. One time the main server brought me a lemonade instead of an Arnold Palmer - I didn't really care so I didn't say anything, but not only did the assistant NOTICE that I had the wrong drink, he brought me the correct one and cleared the lemonade. This was after the room started to fill up as people came in for dinner. VERY impressive!   The food was great, the price point exceptional and the service, impeccable. We really enjoyed Echo & Rig and will definitely be back.",

It's in a nice location out in Summerlin area in Tivoli Village.  Prices and portions are really impressive so it's definitely worth the buck.   Their steak tartare by far is one of the freshest and best ones I've ever had. I truly enjoy their short rib hash that's on their brunch menu. Only downfall are options with dessert because I believe all they offered were different types of ice cream sundaes. I personally am not a big fan of ice cream but I do admit I did try their salted caramel sundae and that was delicious!   I highly recommend checking this place out. :)",

Super tender but slightly chewy at the same time.  I split an American Kobe and that I thought was even better.   It's worth the 20 min drive from the strip.",

Grilled corn & fresh marjoram. Mmmmmmm. Pork belly was good, but what did yall do with the skin?! It was missing.   Grilled octopus. That was just ok.   Will come back again. I won't write about our first time for brunch though. Forgive and forget.   But thank you Sam for incredible service!",

    "text": "This place is a gem! An amazing destination for steaks and seafood. I've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. My first time was for lunch, and I am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. But don't let that fool you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco.   On the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. Servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. In these trips, I have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! For appetizers, you HAVE to get the Portobello fries. They are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) that I have ever eaten. I dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me).   Other noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, fried spinach, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. Wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. They are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.  For proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. Each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. There is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. Knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. Although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. I personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. Lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from Echo & Rig, and let me tell you that it is my new favorite fish. If you're not in the mood for steak, GET THE BUTTERFISH!!  Their dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. I would like more variety, but will not complain because I still love that caramel turtle sundae. If you haven't been in awhile, go back. They have added many new signature items in their menu. If you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. There are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu that you will leave stuffed and happy. I LOVE Echo & Rig and think it is an amazing gem in Suburban Las Vegas with the perfect price point and atmosphere. Don't even think about going to the chain steakhouse down the street when you can be receiving great quality for the same price.",

Even tho I saw the next table had proper red wine glasses.   The food. You're better off ordering appetizers and all the extra sides. They were what really made the meal. Sadly my $100 steak was not seasoned at all, and it even had gristle.  No wonder they offer 4 different kinds of sauces for the steak.  I expected more from the desserts conserving how large their menu is, but there wasn't anything really appealing offered.",

I thought they always had a full steak menu like Smith & Wollensky but it is limited to steak and eggs during brunch. The host was nice enough to ask the chef in the back if I can order dinner instead. I wanted steak and kettle chips ...nothing fancy. They were nice enough to accommodate my request. The waiter raved about the fried portabello mushrooms so I took a chance on them . They were tasty and worth a try! My steak was medium well which I had with some bearnaise sauce. I love people watching here so I stayed for some dessert . Plus it was a perfect day to sit on the balcony . I'm not typically the eat outdoors type unless it's beautiful out. I ordered the Turtle Sundae as I ate it I contemplated on being back from vacation and how Tivoli Village will be the closest I would get to anywhere exotic for about a year. The sundae was delicious topped with caramel, nuts ..very satisfying.   Psst.. If you go to the bathroom their scrub for your hands makes me feel like I'm at the spa. It's replenishing especially in this heat. It also smells great! If you forgot your lotion go to the bathroom and try the hand scrub.   I love Echo and Rig because the prices are reasonable, the staff is super friendly and I love the ambience!",

We had red wine, but is was hot and we were not offered a decanter, we requested one but they never brought it. The greeting by the hostess and the manager was warm, but our waitress pretty much forgot about us the rest of the evening. If it not were for the wine issue and the forgetful waitress, I would've give them a 5 star review.",

If you want to try this cut, it would serve you well to call in advance and have them put your name on one. They'll run out quickly. The cauliflower, we nicknamed crack cauliflower. Order it and you'll see why. The Portobello fries are ordered every time we go. The chef seems to nail the temperature of the steaks every time. For lunch, I like the steak salad as well as the braised short rib grilled cheese. One of the cool things about this restaurant is that they don't charge a corking fee. So feel free to bring as many bottles as you like.",

    "text": "Food here is good but prices are on the higher end. YOU CAN BRING YOUR OWN WINE AND THERE IS NOT A CORKING FEE. Echo and rig is a traditional upscale steakhouse. The plaza it's located in is beautiful and makes you forget you're in Las Vegas. Plenty of parking around this area so don't settle for the first parking spot you see or you could possibly be walking a lot. This steakhouse is 2 stories. First floor is a waiting area, a bar, and an area with a frig with raw meat (I think this place is also a butcher shop). All dining tables are on the top floor and there is both indoor and outdoor seating. Menu items are as affordable as $12 for sandwiches and can go higher depending on the type of entree you get. Appetizers are for sharing and are roughly around $6-$10. I started with the portobello fries and garlic mash potatoes, both were delicious. I got the filet (about $37) and although the portion was small, the meat was tender and juicy, melt like butter. Only complaint I had was I came with a large party with a reservation for 8:30pm and we were not seated until 9:20pm!!! That's almost an hour my party had to wait and we were all present at 8:30pm. Overall, food here is good but can get a bit pricey. Definitely worth a try for a Vegas local or if you have friends in town.",

    "text": "You walk in and it smells just like raw meat. Then the hostess takes you upstairs. Up a lot of stairs to the dining room. I personally hate restaurants with two floors because the last thing I want to do when I am fat, full and happy after eating is go down a bunch of stairs. I go to the gym for cardio not to restaurants. Design flaw!  Our server was Nan who was fine. It's early for me, I am grumpy, I am mad at the stairs. I am sure it's part of her job to ask if we have been there before but does everyone who says no get a history lesson on the chef/owner/locations? It was a dissertation and guess what? I don't really care, if I am interested in the background I'll ask, don't have the server waste my time and theirs with a story just short of...he started off as a young boy...  Then we get to the menu...about six brunch entrees were described to us. Why give me a menu if it's going to be navigated for me? I seriously have never been to any restaurant where there server had to recite as much as Nan did before my order was even taken.   My drink was terrible. I tried to like it.  I got the black and blue mojito.  I described it as blackberry minty toothpaste with alcohol.  Nan took it off the bill. My water was kept full.  The service was good.  The food was good. My companions were happy with their entrees and I got the blueberry buttermilk pancakes with a side order of potato pancakes. The blueberry pancakes have lemon zest in them and as was described by Nan and the menu it came with blueberry syrup for added sweetness. The pancakes were delicious. However, as luck would have it...THE CHEF HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR!!  I nearly died laughing at the syrup.  Let it be known I come from NY where we have real maple syrup so I can smell Aunt Jemima/Mrs. Butterworth a mile away. Seriously. The second the \"blueberry syrup\" was in front of me I knew what it was. HEY, CHEF YOU CANNOT PUT BLUEBERRIES IN AUNT JEMIMA SYRUP AND CALL IT BLUEBERRY SYRUP! It doesn't work like that!!  Otherwise the food was a few notches above satisfactory.  It was reasonably priced.   The downfall of this place is in the details. Paper table coverings (I get it butcher paper...steakhouse but it just doesn't exude the classy atmosphere this place is trying to project.) The cardboard check presenters with paper clips just seems trashy not hipster, cool, modern elegant vibe attempting to be put forth.  The long winded lectures we have to listen to. It's all unnecessary as well as the stairs.  A better location would be more enticing for me to want to visit again.   Dear Jenny G. This is just a review of a restaurant, I had no idea I would  personally hurt someone's feelings (yours) so badly by posting an honest and somewhat humorous review that you'd need to leave me a \"compliment\". Do you work there? Who are you?? P.S. Sorry not sorry, now stop harassing me and go do something more useful with your time.  ****The owner called me directly to discuss my experience.  I am impressed that an owner would take the time to listen to a more in depth description of my experience.  Unfortunately, he felt I didn't enjoy the food from his message to me. I want to make clear the food was very good! There is lack of description on the menu itself, if not some details misleading (For example the syrup). FYI I do have a culinary arts degree for anyone who was wondering. We were happy with our food.  Some aspects of the service needed to be tweaked a little, those were my issues.****",

RED RED.....  5) Horseradish Butterfish - was mostly tasteless and undercooked also  6) Rainbow salad - its ALL quinoa - I mean....no salad about it.. misleading description  Mushroom soup is great as always....only thing that was this time.  Service is great - cant seem to cook anything through though without burning it ( And STILL not cooking it through)  A nice high end steakhouse like this HAS to hire chefs that know the basic differences between rare - medium - medium well etc.....I mean...come on.... its ridiculous.  The steak tastes good - just unfortunate that chefs don't take to the time to get it right the first time.... There are FAR too many options for great steak for less in Vegas for this type of lackluster performance.",

    "text": "Weakest happy hour in town.   This is just about HH and we were pretty surprised at the low quality of anything being served from this place. I've had it bookmarked for a very long time and I said to my man, let's try the HH menu before we make dinner reservations. HH should inspire you to come back for the value but also back for the real thing. That definitely didn't happen here.  The space itself is really nice and overlooks Tivoli village which is inspired by Italy. Unfortunately it was filthy and none of the tables were cleared in the bar area for happy hour. We waited and one was cleared for us and then sat next to the other tables that were never cleared off. Our server was pleasant, nothing negative on that front.   We decided to order the three items they offered on HH to try them all. Shrimp cocktail, steak & eggs and a hot dog. Prices are super cheap from 99 cents to $1.99. The shrimp cocktail was inedible, extremely fishy in taste and smell. The steak was like beef jerky and I couldn't even cut into it. It was also a tiny cut but that's expected with these prices. The egg was great, no complaints there. The best offering was the hot dog that came with deli mustard & sauerkraut. The only thing that we finished. The cocktails are all reasonable with other HH menus at beers starting from $3 and house wines from $5 as well as a few other specials.   I would suggest raising the very low rates and serving up some decent HH plates. There's no need to offer such low prices and serve up this kind of food. The restaurant is also very pretty and should be kept up with. It wasn't busy on a Saturday around 4pm and the place was pretty dirty.",

    "text": "I am not like a moon orbiting a massive radiant planet-called Tivoli Village. Few cobblestones and a courtyard doesn't  transform it to an Italian Village. There is no eatery that is healthy and ethnic enough to make my visit worthwhile. The shops mostly cater to women and whatever is there for men is overpriced junk or for teenagers on a sled. Having said that, Echo & Rig, is a valid reason to visit. This newest steak house by Chef and owner Sam Marvin (who is busy opening few more steak houses-one more coming to Vegas next year- I was told.) The concept is unique-even for Vegas ! A Butcher and Steak House. Buy your meat and eat it too!  I love a good steak like London Broil and Pepper Steak,  that I used to imbibe in Chicago, but none of the chefs here know to how to cook London broil, not to mention the meat should be extra lean like sirloin beef or knuckle beef with fat less than 5% as opposed to a porter house steak that is close to 50% fat. Not only the steak houses don't have that kind of lean meat but there is no butcher on the premises.   At Echo & Rig. the meat is displayed on your right as you walk in glassed freezer-the biggest walk in freezer-at a temperature of 32 degrees at all times and you can order knuckle steak or burger or sirloin steak.  Next to the freezer is the biggest solid butcher block (on a broad day light when no one is looking I intend to take this to my kitchen.)   You can also get Wagyu beef from Wyoming or Kobe beef  from Kobe, Japan. The beef is from grass fed cows with no steroids or antibiotics and the sirloin cut of meat (which is on display but not the knuckle beef, which has to be ordered 24 hrs before the cooking time) can be cooked as steak or burger..  The Master Butcher, by the name of Trevor, is lean and healthy looking and  conscious of nutrition, unlike most of the chefs who are ruddy faced and rotund  like Orson Wells or Hitchcock (by the way Alfred Hitchcock, who liked to be called Hitch, was a prolific eater and he believed that a good eater also had a good libido and imported meat, lamb and Dover sole from England and claimed he served the best steak in in LA at his own house.) They serve what ever people ask for and choose. The steak starts at $22.50 but this kind of meat in some gourmet houses are selling at three or four times the price and few of the chefs serving raw meat from unknown butcher.  The Echo and Rig is located in the circle where the fountain is, with the valet parked cars around the fountain (generally speaking, valet's are first cousins of Mario Fittipaldi and they have racing streak in them. They park my car at 45 miles an hour. I saw a valet in LA changing tires at 60 miles an hour. The seat and mirror are adjusted to a midget driver.) This is one complimentary gesture that  I will not make use of.  There are two patios, one on the ground floor facing the Alta Drive and the other on the second floor facing the fountains, which is perfect for private parties. The ambiance is good but there is lot of wasted space.and the one mini bar with waitresses carrying full glasses of wine up the stairs-is a disaster to happen. The bar only serve draft beer and I was not a happy camper, since they have no beer mugs or tall frosted beer glasses (one downgrade) the glasses are the kind you find in a biker bars or bars on main street or the English pubs.  However, they do have half / full glass of wine which is a great idea and they are reasonably priced, On my next visit better the red wine be chilled (and not Las Vegas room temperature of 120 degrees, as the master Somme-liars! tell them to serve) If not I will downgrade another point. The also sell organic beef jerky, cast iron skillet and other items.  There is no Theme here, with antlers head poking out of the wall or mahogany wood or some gimmick to make it look like it is inhabited by macho men or men with fat cigars and fake display of wealth with borrowed BMW's. Good healthy steak is the Theme. Better the other steak houses follow the theme and pricing or they will be extinct..along with the antlers head !",

    "text": "Schizophrenic but promising.  As with any new restaurant, bugs to be worked out. The downstairs check-in/bar wait area appears really disorganized, probably more so than it is. The huge entry seems to be a huge waste of space, especially when you see how cramped some of the areas upstairs are. The butcher area is cool, but I need to see if the selection and quality are up to the hype.   My biggest issue was with the menu. It is poorly laid out at best. They claim to feature their small plates and \"butcher cuts\", yet they are some of the smaller sections on the menu, compared to salads? And lunches?? Also, the pitch the waiter gives about the specialty cuts being so unique-TrI tip, sirloin, flank steak??? Having said all that, the food was good, some of it very good. The sides were terrific (cauliflower, kale, bone marrow,asparagus, etc). The hangar steak is terrific.  However, they also offer 3 cuts \"by the inch\"-ny strip, ribeye, filet. The \"inch\" was more like a half and the meat was ok. Just ok. Tender but not that flavorful and disappointing.  One great thing-bring your own wine-no corkage fee.   As soon as this place decides what it really wants to be, it will improve dramatically. I'd love to think they'd move away from trying to be all things and really emphasize the small plates and specialty cuts. Vegas, and the neighborhood, needs what Echo and Rig could be.",

    "text": "I'm not one for meeting my meat before I eat it, so the working butcher shop with side of cow in the window wasn't appealing to me, but my husband thought it was cool. In the rustic modern entry there is a nice bar, and the butcher, sawing away at tonight's selections. It's all kind of upscale ranch house kitschy, and it works. The food was excellent, the details of which I'll get to after the dining experience itself, which is quite the show.  Our server was a very friendly guy, who proceeded to explain all the cuts of steak, and the most popular side dishes, along with the best way to order. Then he brought out a huge chop board with about half a dozen different Flintstone sized tomahawk cuts and others to show us. The presentation was a bit over the top and long, but he was so nice, and concise with each description that we enjoyed it. Really, the service was impeccable, and a highlight as much as the food. I started with the berry mojito, which was fresh and delicious. Then we had 3 'small plates' that we shared of avocado toast, risotto, and asparagus with fried egg, while our steaks cooked. All three were excellent, w the avocado toast being the best. Next our steaks arrived. We both had the rib eye end cap and it was unctuous! The sear and crust was perfect, the flavor great, however my husbands was a bit blue, being about 1/4\" thicker, but presumably cooked no longer. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. My biggest pet peeve in a steakhouse is when it's not cooked to request. They're all served with homemade garlic potato chips and a Rockefeller stuffed mushroom. Both were tasty, but I thought the chips not a great side because of the constant need to put your utensils down to eat them. You can also choose a sauce out of six, though the steak was so good it wasn't needed. Still, the red wine Demi and bearnaise were great. Lastly, the bathroom was like a spa, with a bowl of salt scrub for your hands that was divine. A nice touch. We will definitely return!",

    "text": "I just created a yelp account for the sole purpose of raving about this restaurant. I would give it 6 stars if I could.   First of all, the ambiance was beautiful. All of the dining tables are upstairs where you have the choice of eating inside or outside on the patio. We chose outside and every single table had a beautiful view of the giant fountain below with pretty lights hanging tastefully to give it the right mood. And to top it all off, they have their own private butchery downstairs where you can buy all the meats they cook at a very reasonable price.   Now, my fiance and I both worked many years in the fine dining restaurant service industry in south Florida, and those of you who are \"in the biz\" know we have unreasonably high standards when it comes to service in a restaurant because we're fully aware of what the best of the best constitutes. Well, with that in mind, the service staff at Echo & Rig completely surpassed my unreasonably high expectations. Arriiana (who, if you read on, is already yelp-famous) was so cute and friendly; she just set a great mood for the rest of the dining experience. As soon as we sat, we were welcomed by Xavier, the manager, who was extremely likable and helped to make sure we were taken care of the entire night. Also, what stood out to me and impressed me the MOST about Xavier is that (because I'm overly observant) he made sure to be a friendly, helpful presence to not only us, but EVERY single table in that restaurant! I watched as he seemed to effortlessly make a connection with every table while at the same time having great synergy with his staff, which shows a True understanding of what management is.   Not only that, but the service staff was obviously trained very well. We had Sam as our server, who was friendly and very knowledgable of the menu.  Sam was also that rare balance of attentive but not overbearing. We never got the feeling of being ignored or pushed out of our table, which can often time ruin your experience. We will definitely be asking for Sam again.    Now for the food! (Sorry this is so long, but if you're like me, these details are important when you're looking to try out a new restaurant)  I wanna start out by saying everything we ordered was beyond delicious. I felt like I was a judge on the season finale of Top Chef and the chef contestants were making it impossible for me the choose a winner.   We ordered the portobello fries and baked Brie for starters. My fiance ordered the bavette cut steak and I ordered the skirt steak. We shared a side of broccolini and garlic mashed potatoes and then shared the caramel turtle ice cream for dessert.   ...I'm going to have a hard time not ordering that exact combination of food every time we dine here because it was so amazingly good.   It's safe to say this is my new favorite restaurant!!",

    "text": "So how does one start a review of a restaurant/butcher shop???? I tell you how, with a comment a good friend said as she was looking at all the meat cuts, WOW,  what a great alternative to WF's!  I can come here order my meat and have a martini while I wait until they cut it up fresh!  That is how I am starting my review of Echo & Rig.  And the patience and care the 23 year old butcher, yup that is not a typo, that took care of her, while in slicing her meat was ...frankly in today's world amazing - that is what I call customer service.  That service does not end there, it only begins there.  Jason and Courtnee  are polite without being pushy, knowing the menu items and making the correct recommendations; friendly but professional, comparable to the 5 star restaurants I have eaten at in Las Vegas - that is the service we received at Echo & Rig, not once, but two nights in a row.  Not to mention Michael , who is just so excited to have the restaurant open - well Michael you are not the only one, we of Vegas and especially Summerlin, cannot be happier, to have a premier, delicious, vivacious, restaurant with great energy opened in our backyard.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  And now for the food -  OMG, delicious.  Fried spinach salad, kale with baby yellow beets, gratin caramelized onion soup with pumpkin squash (I would come back just for that), Portobello fries, Brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon, black spaghetti with seafood and roasted peppers, Butter fish, Sea Bass, skirt steak, prime rib, caramel salted ice cream and short cake and berries with ice cream.... Yup that and more, not one bad item, not one complaint from me or in two days from the 6 people I ate with.  The people around us ate different items and could not stop complementing them, such as the bone marrow and carne asada.  If you are a meat eating you will love this place, if you are conscious of farm to table eating, you will love this place, if you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of choices.  So let me recap: great atmosphere, great food, amazing service and prices, beyond reasonable.  Least I forget to mention the cocktails; they do know how to make a drink. So what does this mean, you need to go and try Echo & Rig at Tivoli Village, make your reservations , book your parties, bring your friends, stop by for a drink, you are not going to regret it!  And they have only just gotten started so it is only going to get better!!",

    "text": "Echo and Rig is located right at the corner of Tivoli Village as you enter the valet round-a-bout. It is conveniently close so you can easily just jump out and get your car parked for you and head on in. I went on a Monday evening and it was surprisingly really busy but despite this, it didn't take long at all to get seated, aprox 10 min. The hostess was very nice and our servers who introduced themselves by name were very well knowledgeable in the menu and gave some pretty good recommendations. We had the misfortune of being seated on the second floor close to an open door on a cold and windy day and right in front of the busy kitchen so it did hinder the atmosphere a little. The entrance is completely visually open to see all the meats hanging in the windows and according to the server they feed their cows only grass and keep them free of steroids and fresh! We ordered the broccolini, steak tartar, lamb, and berry short cake sundae. The broccolini was okay and was slightly overly charred with a bit too much ground pepper, and the medum rare cooked lamb was pretty chewy and dry. The steak tartar was delicious and the ice cream was pretty good as well. While inside I also took note of the head manager who was often at the cashier, overlooking operations, or talking and joking to servers. She made a trip to literally every single table around us, greeting guests but never once took the time to look upon our table or even greet us which disappointed me a little. At the time, every table was full of older crowds more in their 40's and 50's so it may be because we were the youngest (mid 20's) inside and taken less seriously as their older guests. This disappointed me a bit and I probably would of had left a smaller tip if it wasn't for our very nice server and host. Service is key in a fine dining restaurant. Over all I recommend this place, food servers are good, food is tasty, and the price is decent for a finer dine!",

    "text": "I've been to Echo and Rig many times and would normally rate this 4-5 stars, but my recent experience was a bit disappointing.  First, we had a reservation for 8 people.  When the majority of our party arrived, they took us outside!!!  First of all, it's the middle of December and 30 degrees outside.  I don't care if you have heating lamps, in that cold weather, it doesn't help, plus it will cool off the food!!  Outside seating should only be for people without reservations or if requested in the reservation.  Not sure what they were thinking.  After complaining, they finally figured out that they should seat us inside.  Very classless move!!  Also, I fully understand a restaurant is in business to make money, but the Waiters/Waitresses continuous up-selling is absolutely ANNOYING!!!  I don't want your suggestions unless I ask for it!!  They try to make you feel uncomfortable and cheap in front of your party.  They want you to get a more expensive wine, bigger and more expensive steak, etc.  Completely unprofessional.  I've been their many times,  I know what I want and like!!  I'm hoping this nonsense will stop.  If not, I'll tell the waiter myself to stop with the up-sell!!  Other than that, the food, like always is very good. I will definitely be back, but if this crap continues, I'll have a conversation with the Manager.",

Needless to say I've always raved about the menu at Echo and Rig and being a local in the hospitality business ( bartender on the strip) I always take the time to inform my guests about great food. Chef Marvin's reply was an unexpected gesture that has made me willing to try the restaurant again in hopes service has improved.   Ok so last night we returned to Echo & Rig in hopes of a better experience and let me say they DIDN'T disappoint! Let start by saying the fact that the two hostesses are always above and beyond they've remembered us by name which is a nice touch and are always smiling and always helpful to our needs ( we have 3 little ones ) Then we so lucky to sit in Ricky's section ( 2nd time we've been served by him ) Ricky remember us from our last visit and welcomed us back. Knowing the kids can be uneasy and impatient at times he asked if we'd like to get the children started and took our appetizer and cocktails order as well. Like I've stated in my previous post we've been here many times so we know the menu so ordered our main course shortly after as he poured us water. Food as always was amazing and I can't say enough about the services as it was the best experience yet! Echo and Rig has restored our faith in the service and we'll keep spreading word-of-mouth to all our friends and family about this wonderful overall experience.",

    "text": "This review is for the HAPPY HOUR ONLY:  Such an awesome place with a light and airy flare. I love natural light that floods into a space. It brightens my whole day! My best friend and went to Tivoli Village in search of quick drinks and light appetizers: HAPPY HOUR! Since we were on a time crunch we decided to to take advantage of happy hour at as many places as we can. Luckily this place started their happy hour at 3!   We sat at the couches, with fluffy pillows, right by the bar. They offered draft beers for $3, wells for $4, and wines for $5. Unfortunately they only had three items to choose for appetizers: steak and eggs, shrimp cocktail, and a hot dog (pics included).    As a vegetarian, the only item I can order was the shrimp cocktail (see pictures). My friend is a foodie, so she ordered all three.  The shrimp cocktail was original and nothing out of the ordinary. It was served on a plate of lettuce. I only wished it was different type of green, such as spinach or kale. The lettuce made the dish too simple and uninspiring. My friend said the steak and eggs were good, but since she is a RAW eater, she was disappointed that the steak only comes medium rare. The hot dog was... Well, just a hot dog.   For drinks I had the white wine from Argentina, which I loved. My friend had the red, but I apologize for not remembering the type. Both were great for the price though!  Overall the experience was fantastic. The staff was more than accommodating and I will return, but only for the drinks. Stop by if you are in the area and just want a  drink for happy hour without food (its much more peaceful so you can have conversations with friends/colleagues without the restaurant noise). Although they offered the full menu with happy hour, I didn't order full meals, so I cannot review the restaurant as a whole.",

On the other hand, the food was just so average. I just kept thinking this place is surface above substance. Perhaps we didn't order the right things.   The hostess recommended the short rib hash so we ordered it with the roasted chicken sandwich. The poached eggs were good, but the short rib and especially the hash were subpar. The shortrib was dry and tasteless. The hash wasn't seasoned well and also dry and over cooked. However, the watermelon and tomato salad which was very fresh.   The best thing I ordered was the Arnold Palmer. They brought out a refill without my asking, but they just brought out an iced tea, not an Arnold Palmer.   This place feels similar to the vibe at Tivoli, just hype.",

Ramon-terrific waiter. personable and very knowledgeable about the menu. we were originally seated outdoors on a very hot evening....asked to be seated inside and a very nice manager made things right. Its a noisy place but the ambiance is good.Drinks excellent..wife had her pinot...my son had some sort of mexican drink..I had a Makers Manhattan. we split a caesar salad three ways and enjoyed the thick bacon appetizer(ramon said we would!). Wife had the melt in your mouth Butterfish....I had a rib eye and my son had a rib eye cap. Portions not huge..but very good and tasty. We even had a complimentary salted caramel dessert. Sunday brunch was also very good.We had a very high energy server named Raelynda-we liked her a lot. I had the grilled cheese short rib--fabulous. My son got daring with the short rib hash and liked it. Wife had the quiche and my daughter had a BLT. All happy with selections. Service seemed a little slow with the bottomless mimosas. Kept adding orange juice to the glass. be careful. overall..this is a fun spot ..good food and drink. Away from the strip--hooray!",

We were a party of 6 and we had an array of dishes.  The stand outs were the Short Ribs & Hash, the poached Salmon Benedict, and the grilled Cheese sandwich.  We also ordered the thick slices bacon and the fried portobello mushrooms appetizers.  They offer bottomless mimosas and an array of other  delicious alcoholic alternatives.  The restaurant is d delightfully decorated and they have an open kitchen where we admired the chef expediting the orders.  I can't end my review wo mentioning the rest room.  The rest room is very clean and spacious.  On the wash basin, they provided a bowl of honey salt to treat your hands.  Here in Las Vegas, the air is so dry it constantly sucks the moisture out of your skin.  This bath salt leaves your skin soft and moisturizer hours after use. I loved it so much I bought a jar of it in their gift shop.  I love this place. Will come back next time to try their menu.",

Let me say, the best part is walking in and seeing s great selection of meat right before your eyes.  We got seated relatively quick and greeted by our server.  He explained how everything worked and they wheel some selections of their best cuts for you to choose from.  We got the oysters, Portobello fries, fried spinach for starters.  Everything from the appetizers to the main course to dessert was excellent.  Everything was seasoned reasonably, tasted great and the food just melted in your mouth.  For dessert we opted for the seasonal sorbets.  I can't recall the other flavors but the grapefruit sorbet really stuck out to me because it had a wonderful balance of sweet and citrus to refresh your tastebuds.  I definitely recommend stopping by here when you get the chance.  It is like other steakhouses going to be pricey, but it is a with it destination for birthdays, anniversaries, or any type of special occasion.  Service was also very excellent and attentive to our needs.",

One of the management staff, Beth, was also very helpful and attentive. The food is exquisite and everything was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend the portobello mushroom fries and the jumping beef as a couple of their signature dishes that are worth trying. The service is as good as the food. We took a shot in the dark going off strip to eat, but it was a total home run. Wether you're visiting or local, if you don't want to deal with the hype of the strip, and you're looking for a nice place to eat dinner, Echo and Rig will not disappoint. Thank you to the friendly staff for making my brother's birthday special.   \"Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone\"  -Gertrude Stein",

    "text": "I hate to do this, because I had been looking forward so long to getting here. (You know how it is when place is just around the corner; you don't have any sense of urgency.) My husband and I finally went to lunch yesterday, to celebrate our birthdays, anniversary, and the sale of a home. There was a huge table of people celebrating behind us on the patio, so that might explain some of our dismay with the place...but this restaurant has been open several years and should be able to handle high volume. Yes, we did have a reservation! We mentioned several times it was a special occasion for us. We were not offered congratulations or acknowledged in any way (we couldn't help overhear another table next to us get free sundaes, because they had a birthday...be consistent in your treatment of patrons!!). Otherwise, our server was very pleasant, if harried. Although they seem to get their wired crossed service-wise...the water guy came up right after she left to get our SPARKLING water, and without saying a word, he poured STILL water into glasses. Our server had to fix that. The food: we ordered the sausage of the week (haha!), the portabello fries, the roasted squash with pepitas, slow-cooked brisket, and the spencer steak. Here's what tasted the best: the stuffed mushroom that came with the steak. And I will give them props for making the chicken sausage taste good (we had a LOT of nasty tasteless chicken sausages in Singapore, which tries to cater to the taboos of all religions). The Spencer steak was \"meh\". It had a nice char, and was cooked to order; but just wasn't that good. Modest beefy taste, and very difficult to cut. It didn't seem that tough; so maybe the steak knife wasn't sharp enough. Don't order the Chimichurri sauce for your steak...it was all oil and had none of the bright taste that a good Chimichurri sauce should!! My husband loves lean brisket that falls apart when you put a fork to it...nope. This was fatty and chewy. Portabello fries were good (esp. the dipping sauce), but I've already learned to make them better at home...and I serve mine HOT. These were not :-( The roasted squash tasted good, but I was surprised they didn't remove the rind, which was tough!    So...I am taking off a star for service slip-ups, and another for less-than-stellar food. (When you spend $100 at lunch, yeah, it should be stellar. I felt like we were just helping pay their soaring rent at Tivoli; not getting a memorable meal.) But hours later, I decided to take another star off, for using MSG in their food. I have a very specific allergic reaction to MSG (you don't want to know!), and an upscale steakhouse should NOT have to resort to it to add \"savory\" flavor. I don't know whether they have always been over-hyped; or they are on the downslide, but we won't be back.  Tips: for a delicious inexpensive steak,. try the flatiron steak at any TGI Friday's: beefy, tender, and sides are included. For a truly memorable steakhouse experience, try Andiamo at the D. We have now tried all the upscale steakhouses in town, and that continues to be our favorite.",

Waiter was wonderful and so was the Mgr that came around to check on us.  Great service.   The star of the night was the delicious Tomahawk bone in ribeye! Absolutely delicious!                   We also had lamb chops which was wonderful.  Grilled Sea bass cooked to perfection.   A must try is their popular portobello mushroom fries with an aioli sauce. This definitely hits the spot.  Nice sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes.   Above all is the great staff and ambience.  I love this place located in the beautiful Tivoli Village of Summerlin.",

    "text": "I haven't dined at many classy establishments in my lifetime, definitely few enough to count on one hand (if not one finger). And despite my love affair with all things steak, I've only eaten steak at a restaurant once before Echo & Rig (and it was just a so-so steakhouse in Santa Barbara that I couldn't tell you the name of or anything about the meal beyond the steak was tasty.  Anyway! While visiting a friend in Vegas who takes me to all of his favorite food spots while I'm there, he suggested Echo & Rig for dinner on my last night in town. He'd never eaten there before, but passing by while walking in Tivoli Square, he, a fellow crazed steak fan, knew that he needed to eat at this classed up butcher shop.  We waited for just a few minutes for a table, but I didn't mind taking that time ogling the meats and sausages in the butcher case. Sadly, there was no one working the raw oyster bar on the first floor near the bar.  The restaurant seating is upstairs and I really loved that our server asked if we preferred the elevator or stairs. She sat us right near a big (closed) glass door and I loved having the light and view without the heat and wind of being actually outside.  Throughout the meal, the waitstaff regularly referred to my friend as Mr. Levin, which was a touch neither of us had ever experienced at dinner. Our server checked in with us many times for water and cocktails before we ordered. The best moment was when she brought out a board with some of the meat cuts on it. 20-some to 40-some ounce slabs of raw, marbled as all get-out red meat just waiting to be seared and devoured.  My friend and I had to joke about the meats being \"to share\" since both of us would be more than happy to take down one of those each. It was especially helpful that she explained where the different cuts come from and which ones are better ordered medium than medium rare to allow for more of the marbling to melt into the meat.  Neither my dining companion nor I are big on drinking, and wine is repulsive to me, so the vast assortment of wines here did nothing for us. The small cocktail menu on the table though caught my eye, and we ordered two drinks that actually sounded really delightful: Le Passion and a Duck, Duck Goose (how could you not?).  I can usually taste the alcohol in anything. but these drinks were phenomenal. I could taste tequila in the LR, but it was such a bright, citrusy, well-balanced drink that I liked it. I tasted pretty much no alcohol in the DDG and actually drank the whole thing.  Alongside the flat or sparkling water provided and the cocktails (only $10 each btw), I got a lemonade that was bright and tart, not too sweet at all.  We got the lamb cigars for an appetizer and they were exquisite. Not salty, the flavor was rich and complimented beautifully by the tzatziki sauce (which I tend to dislike) since it often tastes so cucumber-y, but this was a very light flavor that cooled down the spice and temperature of the lamb. The pickled red onions were fruity and sweet, not at all what I was expecting as someone who hates briny pickle flavor - they were like bread & butter style pickled onions.  My friend ordered a rib eye medium, and I a New York rare.The rare made it tougher to cut as less fat had melted into the meat, but it was still perfect to me. It was juicy and flavorful and I just savored every bite. My friend loved his rib eye and even said it was so good (along with the rest of the meal) that not being able to order 16oz. rather than 12 was totally okay.  The chips with the steak were great! They were slightly salted and peppered. Of the sauces we asked for, the brandied mushroom was my favorite; it was sweet and tangy and I want to put it on everything. I had to be careful not to drench the steak in it and just use it as a compliment. I felt the same about the charred onion, with its sweetness that could almost overpower the steak but stopped just short. My friend is a huge fan of horseradish cream and said this one had little kick, but was smooth and flavorful.  I fully expected to just ignore the mushroom Rockefeller since I really don't care for mushrooms, but it was delicious!A cooked mushroom top, topped with a crunchy breadcrumby topping. Usually the texture of a mushroom makes me gag but this was cooked to tender perfection.  We also ordered the asparagus and fried egg as a side as per our server's recommendation. Cooked until tender and no longer stringy or chewy, the asparagus sat atop a creamy green sauce and had on top of it a fried egg and shaved parmesan cheese. I would have liked a more runny yolk.  This is definitely a great place for a date or a celebratory gathering. All of the staff is so attentive, kind, and genuine. The food is out of this world.  We felt taken care of and appreciated. If anything, they didn't want us to leave without ordering dessert! For how special everything about the experience was, the price was so reasonable!",

    "text": "Echo & Rig is one of those restaurants that doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. They are located in Tivoli Village here in Summerlin. Yet for some reason when I tell people that actually live in the area about Echo, they say things like \"did it just open\" or they'll ask \"is it brand new\" which always makes me wonder what kind of advertising they do if any. Anyway this place is fun. They have a nice atmosphere, a good crowd and are always consistent. Ok things to try: Start with the Cauliflower it's prepared with Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions. They are very good. I also like the Brussel Sprouts which are made with Pistachio & Fresh Lemon. For Fish entrees you must try two. First the Organic King Salmon made with carrot puree, bloomsdale spinach, garlic, lemon and olive oil. Second is the Horseradish Crusted Butterfish with roasted root vegetables & tarragon pinot sauce both are very good but the Butterfish is my top pick. Now for the meats. I would say you can't go wrong with any but my three pics are The Spencer Steak, The Filet Tenderloin and lastly my favorite The Jumping Beef which is made with filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes & Peruvian demi-glace, very good. No matter what you choose it'll be good they are doing a good job. If you are a Summerlin local and haven't been, then hop over to Tivoli and step into Echo & Rig for a bite!",

Portabello fries are different & yummy dipping sauce. They serve fried potato chips with your steak and a stuffed mushroom. I ordered crab cake which was mushy crab - not lump. The chopped salad was different and good size ( enough to take some home). I saw some people getting sandwiches which were huge and looked good. You can do a salad or sandwich on the dinner menu for around $10-12.00 ea. We could have easily split both, they were good size which is a nice option on a dinner menu. We like to split a dinner and order salad and soup. My husband got the filet (8oz). Good not great. It's just so noisy and hot up where the dining is. It wasn't memorable as far as what we were expecting. I think this place might be better for a late lunch than dinner.  The bus boy was more attentive than our waiter.

We found this place on yelp and are so happy we did!   We tried the pork belly...mmm delicious! There are so many small plates, we will be sure to come back on our next trip to try more yummy!!  My boyfriend had the spencer with chimichurri sauce... it was cooked perfect! I can't remember the name of the cut I had, but it was also cooked at the perfect temp (med, as recommended by oscar), I had Bernaise sauce with my meat.  We had the cauliflower, which was interesting! It was sweet, spicy, & savory all at once.. must try it! The mashed potatoes were also good.  All in all you can't go wrong here.. food, service, ambiance all on point! Keep up the great work there!! :)",

Waiter was very kind and always on top of everything. Pricing wasn't too bad, you get what you pay for and this place is quality! Definitely would like to get more information on their butcher shop and how it is. Will be back for dinner one night!",

    "text": "I had a girlfriend in town last month and decided to try Echo and Rig for brunch. We both ordered the quiche and a crab cake on the side. The quiche was really enjoyable and light, served with some mixed greens. My friend ordered the crab cake and it was ALL crab and quite filling.  I decided to head back a few weeks later for a birthday dinner. We ordered a HUGE bone in ribeye which was fantastic. It was cooked more rare than medium which is what I asked for, but since it was shared I just ate the more cooked areas. We also tried the lamb cigars, chopped salad, portabello fries and roastic garlic mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes really stood out in my opinion and I would be happy to order them again. My brother loved the lamb cigars--they definitely had a strong lamb flavor but the tatziki sauce added` a nice balance. I typically love portabello fries, but I feel like I could take or leave the portabello fries here as the batter was a little thick for my taste. My aunt can be a little picky with her food but she seemed to really enjoy the chopped salad with cilantro dressing. They also brought out ice cream for her birthday was so delicious and a great end to a great meal!  The service both times I visited this restaurant was truly exceptional.  I would be happy to return here with company or to celebrate a special occasion.",

The bathroom was phenomenal it had a salt scrub that made your skin feel so soft. The server even boxed up our left overs for us.

    "text": "Where do I begin.. I made reservations and brought my husband here for Fathers Day along with our two teenagers. Everything was going great until they sat us at our table. There was food on my chair, about 3 tablespoons of crap. I should've said something but didn't. I brushed it off with my hand to the floor. I smelled something dirty and couldn't figure it out.   The busser filled our glasses with water. My husband took a drink and said his glass smelled foul. I immediately picked up my glass and figured out that's where the smell was coming from. The glasses where DIRTY. I looked at my glass a little closer and there was food particles floating in there!!!!!! OMG!! My kids glasses were dirty too.   I told our waiter and he replaced them with clean ones (so we thought). The new glasses were hot. He took them out of the dishwasher. He walked away and a few minutes later came the busser and filled with water. I touched the glass and it was rough and you could scratch off the particles of food on it. As the water sat in the glass it loosen up the food from the inside of my glass and again more \"floaties\" I think their dishwasher is broken or someone in the back is not doing their job right.   Management please look into it. We paid our $200 bill and just left. I will never go back. Our waiter was awesome but nobody wants to eat on dirty dishes. I just can't believe nobody else noticed. I've never expect to go thru this with this place but it happened. I've been to many restaurants and never had an experience like this.",

The macaroni was cooked perfectly and had just enough chew to it.  Then i ordered the Buthers cut Ribeye with Bearnaise sauce -I ordered it mid rare and it was closer to rare than it was to mid rare.  Didnt want to send it back as I still enjoy rare steaks. -Bearnaise sauce was good, nothing to write home about but good.  My partner in crime K.O. had the Hawaiian cowboy which tasted more like korean style marinate for kalbi than Hawaiian flavoring. Wish it wasnt written as a Hawaiian cowboy as it was very misleading.  Ambience was good and it looking at all the butchered meat while waiting for a table gave me something to do.  They also dont try to upsell you on bottled water and have their own state of the art filtration system and offer flat or sparkling water.  Definitely worth a visit, oh and the restrooms was really nice.",

My friend recently moved to this area and recommended we try out Echo &Rig. I logged in to \"Open Table\" and grabbed a 6:00 seating. We were seated by a friendly local young lady and immediately greeted by one of the managers who warmly welcomed us. We weren't aware that there was outdoor patio seating or we would have requested it. Oh well, next time. Our server was immediately introduced and he took our drink order and also offered flat or sparkling water. Our server was amazing! His name was Hugo and we will most definitely request him when we return this summer. Hugo carefully explained the menu and presented a large tray of the most beautiful assortment of steaks. We selected the 32oz Porterhouse which was charged to a med. rare perfection! The steak would take awhile to cook so our server presented us with a beautiful salad of watermelon and heirloom tomatoes.  Our steak arrived cooked to perfection and sliced by the chef as we requested. We ordered a couple of sides, the garlic mashed with cheddar and a sweet potato. They offer so many side dishes it was hard to choose. It was a special touch to also receive all of the wonderful sauces. I especially enjoyed the bernaise sauce and the Demi glace. We were too full to order dessert but look forward to ordering next time. Our overall experience was excellent. The noise level was high so if you are looking for quiet I don't recommend. The staff and the diners were a lively group and the service 5Star!  I highly recommend you try out Echo &Rig......not overly pricy either for QUALITY beef!",

Other two times were with my man and the dog and well.. I could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an NYC subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever.   Other than great company, the food is also pretty good. I love a good off the strip steakhouse.  They used to have this gazpacho that is just ridiculous. It's off of the menu now. I recently  e-mailed the GM asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! My love and I had an amazing time preparing it at home. Got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. Just perfect. Thank you guys so so much!! I made two gallons of it, probably. Gazpacho for days, people.  The fried spinach salad is pretty amazing. Great texture paired with tangy and sweet Asian vinaigrette.  The grits and pork belly is just amazing. My steak was as pretty damn good too. Everything was lovely except the ceviche.... Interesting flavor, off putting color. Did not care for it, but only because I was craving the traditional chopped shrimp, onion, cilantro, lime situation.   Sit on the patio, the evening and nightfall are great :-)",

I didn't realize just how far off the strip it was, but it was nice not being in the middle of the hustle 'n bustle of the strip for the hour or two I spent here. My only real complaint is that I was seated outside on the balcony in December - which wouldn't have been so much of a problem if all of their heaters weren't breaking at the same time while I was trying to enjoy my dinner. The cold didn't completely ruin my experience. The waiter brought little blankets to use while we ate which was thoughtful and unexpected. I just wish the heaters worked!   That being said, food is amazing.   I'd suggest making a reservation before coming. And give yourself some time to make it out here if you are coming from the strip.",

I am a carnivore- don't judge   It is the typical Sunday brunch rush, however our wait time was next to nothing. I usually love a booth and they obliged us with our request, even though they had many reservations. There is a small waiting area with table and chairs that you can sit until your name is called.   Our waitress Raelynda was pretty amazing. Very upbeat, and knowledgeable of the menu. I truly enjoy my dining experiences with polite staff.   We got the NY egg sandwich, Scrambled Steakhouse, Avocado Toast,  and the Tomato Watermelon Salad. Of course hot tea and Tropical Green tea.   The hustle and bustle of this restaurant is def fast paced and a wonderful place to just spend time with those in your party. I would def recommend, as it is located in Tivoli Village and you can't go wrong. The atmosphere is whatever you like honestly. As some people were dressed up and others were casual.   They have outdoor seating as well. Location is convenient Rampart / Charleston. Plenty of parking.",

Lately, though, it's been the main entree having fails, with one side dish screw-up.  3 trips ago, my ribeye cap was virtually a salt lick, and the replacement was all gristle and hard fat. 2 visits ago, the ribeye cap (and another at the next seat of our table) was again impossible to cut and eat from the gristle and fat.  As we were introducing family to Echo & Rig by bringing them there for a celebration, that was extra disappointing.  So, having learned my lesson to avoid the much-touted ribeye cap (which used to be an excellent piece of steak), I ordered lasagna on the next trip. Sadly, their menu hadn't stated that there was more ricotta than all other ingredients combined, so I once again left Echo & Rig unsatisfied.   Oh, and they forgot the marjoram in the corn & marjoram. It was quickly replaced with a properly herbed side, but it's kind of laughable that they forgot an ingredient of a 2 ingredient dish, whose name is the two ingredients.  As of now, despite the years of loving Echo & Rig, they're off my list of favorite restaurants and I don't know if or when we'll return. They've been telling us for a while to go away and I'm finally getting the hint.  Oh, and I suggest ear plugs if you go there anyway, especially on the weekend. The acoustics are designed to accentuate the noise and it can get quite painful at times. Sadly, this is a general trend with restaurants lately but suits a nice steakhouse far less than it does a chain restaurant/brewpub.",

Also when you call and make a reservation they ask you if anybody in your party has any allergies, then when the server greats you they ask about the allergies and explain what you can have. Our server was ver nice and knowledgeable! She was great. The food is always consistently good. Atmosphere is great too.",

If you have not tried this place you must! The service is 5 star! Food is so good! Its a steak house, eat the steak! Clean restaurant, romantic, wait staff is full of suggestions and very accommodating.  The Brussel sprouts were more like flakes of Brussel sprouts, no halved or quartered,which we love them, and were a little disappointed when we got them. We split everything and we overall pretty happy. The dessert..... OMG! Delish! Our waiter suggested and we were celebrating BFs bday. Really great food, Bill was just under $100. Worth it, except for Brussels. We will be back when we are in town!",

I had already planned on getting the short rib hash, but when we ordered I stayed safe with the eggs all around.  One of the managers, Beth I believe her name was, made her rounds to tables. It was nice seeing her check in with everyone. And our server Jessie was the best! He recommended his favorites and was very knowledgeable when we asked about the menu.   We will definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu.   They moved Saturday's farmer's market to today so we stopped in and walked through.",

    "text": "Amazing Food with Stellar Service  Recently dined at Echo and Rig to celebrate a friend's birthday. When I made the reservation the kind hostess asked if we were celebrating anything on the night of our reservation. When I told her we were celebrating a birthday she asked for the name of who we were celebrating. She was very engaging and even asked if we had any other plans to celebrate that night. I told her we would be going to the Paul McCartney concert later that evening and we were looking forward to a fun evening.  Much to our surprise, when we arrived to the restaurant they greeted us BY NAME and wished our friend a very happy birthday. Nicholas Gutierrez, the manager on duty came to our table to introduce himself and wish our friend a very happy birthday. He also mentioned that he knew we were going to the concert and promised to get us in/out with plenty of time to make it to T-Mobile Arena for the show. And boy did he keep to his word! He constantly checked in with us to make sure we were having an incredible experience.  Service was spot on! Never had to ask for anything. The steaks are AMAZING. Perfectly seasoned and grilled to perfection. The kale salad was fantastic, as were the four side dishes we ordered. The staff came out to sing happy birthday and presented our friend with a dessert on the house.  We purposely wanted to eat off the strip, and although Echo and Rig is about 20 minutes from the strip, it is worth the drive/Uber ride to get there. Value for money this place can't be beat! And the service will blow you away.",

    "text": "Very cool and trendy restaurant in the Tivoli Village plaza in Sommerlin.  Once you walk in there's a market and butcher area where you can see them cutting up different cuts of meat.   It's kind of interesting getting a peek of the preparation process.  There is also a bar where you can grab a drink as you're waiting for your table. The entire second floor is mostly where all the dining happens.  We came in a pretty big group so the staff was trying their best to accommodate all of us.  The prices for the menu items were very reasonable and it didn't feel like you were going to be broke at the end of the night.  The small plates were amazing. We had: Cauliflower (normally I reluctantly eat cauliflower, but the preparation was great) Mac & Cheese (perfect balance, it wasn't too creamy or too dry) Grilled Thick-Cut Bacon & bbq sauce (this disappeared from the table very quickly, a table favorite) Butcher's Sausage (can't go wrong with sausage) Asparagus & Fried egg. (This was good, but with a table of carnivores this lasted a while but was still really good) Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli (one of my personal favorite dishes, very thick cuts of portobello.  simply amazing) Fried Calamari. (pretty standard, it's what you would expect)  For my entree I got the Rib Eye cap along with the lemon chimichurri sauce.  The steak was ok. It wasn't bad, but nothing amazing like the appetizers.  I heard really good reviews about the fish as well.  That can be something I'll try next time.  All the desserts were sundaes and there were so many different types and variations.  We shared the Chocolate Cherry, Cappuccino, Caramel Turtle, and the Apple Pie.  I can't really remember the differences, but they were all amazing.  They were a decent size where there was 6 of us digging in and getting a taste of all of them.",

But it beats me, we got to eat here hahaha! I had an awesome time here, we all came for bottomless mimosas. UNLIMITED mimosas for only $16! It's a high end butcher shop so they also sell meat here as well. Irrelevant or not, go to the restroom first and wash your hands with their sea salt soap.. You'll probably want to shower with that!! Hahaha. They sell it downstairs as well.. just go for yourself and see what I'm talking about! It looks high end here, but the food was VERY inexpensive. We also had a great time here because of our experience with Nan and the management.  Ok ok, a few people mentioned the portobello mushrooms fries and wow, it's a banger. If you get the chance, order the thick grilled bacon.. dip that with the bar b que sauce and it will leave you wanting more.  I ordered the butcher blend burger and the quality of the meat was on point. USDA prime beef medium rare, so delicious. They added yellow tomatoes which I thought was odd because I've never had one but in fact it went well with it! My girlfriend ordered the Flat Iron and that was delicious, next time I'm ordering that! A few friends ordered the short ribbed hash which I had a bite of and that one bite was promising!   Def a good restaurant to come back for when I'm in the area, looking forward for round 2.",

We had the hanger steak and the ribeye as well as the portabella fries and a side of brussel sprouts.  Entire meal with one drink was over $100. So I dont agree with their two $$ price level. Its definitely a $$$ restaurant if you want to leave satisfied and full at all.  The amount of food was perfect for 2 people. We ate pretty much everything because it was really delicious.  Servers were friendly and attentive  If it wasnt for the long wait to be seated with reservations it would be a five star experience. There didnt seem to be much sense of urgency about reservations and the staff could have been more apologetic for not being able to keep their timing in order. Saw atleast 3 groups leave angry and go to Brio across the street, I was patient though since we had already waited 20 minutes at that point.  Ill be back, but for more of special occasions since I cant be spending $50 a person on dinner every week",

    "text": "Friends have recommended me this restaurant, I finally went to go check it out and was not disappointed. The service, and the food were great!   The avocado veggie salad was great, the sauce was what gave it such a great flavor. I ordered the diver scallops and they were amazing. I wish the positions were a bit better, for what you are paying for. I also got the chicken sandwich which comes with a mouth watering fresh apple slices with some sort of vinaigrette on the side. The mushroom fries are what they're known for and know I understand why, they were amazing! It made me want to find the recipe and make them at home lol.   Overall, I will definitely be going back. This time I didn't make it for the breakfast menu as they said it's only on weekends.",

    "text": "Echo and Rig is a must try place if you like steak.  See <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fechoandrig.com%2Fhistory%2F&s=4c7afd734e99e76d7252637cbe97d64d5cea5c8cdec1579d2ee4ad8991921d37\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">echoandrig.com/history</a> for info behind the restaurant.  In short, a well known chef re-invented the steakhouse by making it light and airy; providing great steaks at a good value and topping this off with excellent service.  As our server stated you don't need to mortgage your house to purchase a steak.   I really like steaks cooked over a wood grille.  Here they cook over red oak.  Cooking over wood adds a nice flavor.  Wood cooking can be a bit harder in the kitchen because the grille can have wide temperature swings.  Echo and Rig nailed the cooking and delivery.  Many steaks are what they call Natural prime where beef is fed natural grass and finished with grains to create prime marbling.  On top of this you have two ways to purchase steak: 1) from the menu or 2) a larger shareable piece from the butcher tray.  The larger pieces are priced by high the ounce.  Service at Echo and Rig really stood out which started with excellent staff communication.  The hostess found out it was our first time and where we were from.  Magically, our server then asked us why we came from our home town to Summerlin Nevada.  Before the evening was over the manager stopped by to talk and give us his card.  He promised to give us another special evening when we came back which he did.    So all was present to give Echo and Rig a five istar rating.  We will be back when our travels take us to Las Vegas.  Our first experience we had brunch consisting of watermelon salad, avocado toast, steak frites brunch and a cappuccino sundae.  All was superb.   Our second time we had a steak from the butcher tray which was a thick thirty ounce prime New York precisely cooked along with some sides.",

Then waiting 10 minutes to run our card after a 10 minute wait to give someone the card. Food is blah. I got an eggs Benny and the Canadian bacon didn't stand out and I couldn't taste it really.. so fail on the execution because the meat should be the focus. And please put the butcher behind glass because that smell is rough. Again great idea but poor execution.

    "text": "With upwards of 2000+ reviews, there is not a lot that I can say that has not already be said.  So on that note, I will narrow my review down to the following four points about Echo & Rig.   1).  THIS PLACE HAS A MODERN FEEL VS THE TRADITIONAL STEAKHOUSE LOOK:   When out of town guests or friends are seeking a \"steakhouse\" out on our Summerlin side of town, I tend to shy away from what one thinks of as a traditional steakhouse.  You know the ones...darker ambiance and decor (maybe wood walls), dimly lit, appears stuffy and old school, rich heavy food choices and the traditional items you find on every menu from Smith & Wollensky to T-Bones (no offense) and usually very pricey.  Echo & Rig has a ton of natural light, it lighter in color and has a big open feel.     2) I AM QUICK TO RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AND I DON'T EVEN EAT MEAT: Echo & Rig has a varied \"tapas like, sharable, extensive\" appetizer/side area of their menu which really is a highlight.  This part of their menu has so many things that are not meat based and are delicious (do yourself a solid and do not leave without eating the portobello mushroom fries with dipping sauce...I order them every single time and love em!).  But in addition to this great part of their menu and knowing that steaks are really the highlight of the restaurant, they always have salads, sandwiches or fresh fish to please any eater like me.   And as for price in my first point, a steak will set you back $30, which seems incredibly reasonable considering that this is Vegas.  A non-meat main dish will set you back under $25.  3).  NO CORKAGE FEE:  Let me repeat.  Echo & Rig does not have a corkage fee.  Unheard of in this town, this steakhouse is 5 stars on Yelp to me for this point alone.  There is s a limit to the number of bottles you can bring, so call to clarify this.  This makes Echo & Rig unique in this market.    4).  BETH & STAFF:  This spot can be very busy, for a variety of reasons, but also because of their patio seating and ability to accommodate large groups.  Beth has been a manager and a server and every single time I visit, she is professional, welcoming, friendly and hustling.  She remembers me and greets me with respect and delivers great customer service every single time.  I would say this about any staff member I am sure, but Beth is notably my favorite.    You are modern steakhouse to me Echo & Rig and with the no-corkage fee policy, you will always happily have my business.",

From their happy hour, brunch, and dinner it's all wonderful. Happy hour menu is great, you cannot beat $1.99 steak and eggs! Their brunch features bottomless mimosas for only $16, they use a good quality champagne and your glass is never empty. Our favorites on the dinner menu is of course the filet, portobello fries, steak tartare, octopus salad, and the wild mushroom soup. to finish definitely get the seasonal sorbet, you will not be disappointed! I love that they do not have a corking fee if you bring your own wine. They track your visits by your phone number which is one of the best customer services strategies I've ever seen. They appreciate repeat customers and it really shows. Ladies make sure you stop by the restroom and use their amazing hand scrub before you leave! The service is impeccable, friendly, and attentive. It's definitely strip quality at a fraction of the price. We have all of our major events here. Why go somewhere else when you know this place is going to be amazing every time?!",

Steak houses in casinos on the Strip will charge you $60 to $80, or even more, and that's just for the steak and the pleasure of inhaling the stale smoke air in the casinos. Our server, Louis, was first class and the manager even checked to see that everything was up to snuff. My wife and I both had the rib-eye ($36) and it was excellent. Some wonderful mushroom soup to start, potato, asparagus and two cocktails, and the total was $135 before tip. You would have spent $250 for a similar meal on the Strip and I doubt that it would have been as good. Hell, you could take an Uber or Lyft out to Echo & Rig and you'd still be ahead of the game.",

    "text": "I just wanted to compliment a few people who took care of us at your establishment about 3 weeks ago! It was a Wednesday night , April 17th &?we came in to eat cause it was my birthday! We got there late...I think it was 9-9:30 when we got there, & I know by the end of the night, everyone is tired & ready to go home, so you sorta feel rushed to get in & out, but our server never made us feel that way , in fact, our service was perfect all the way around, & our dining experience was a 10! Arie was our server & he was just the Best! I had inquired about the filet that I had seen on your website under the $17 menu, but I think he said they didn't offer that anymore , (maybe your website menu with prices  needs to be updated with current menu prices ) , so he had suggested the \"skirt steak\". He explained to me the fat marbling , so you would want to get it cooked to medium I think he said cause it would be too hard to chew anything less than that, so I took his advice, hoping I would like his recommendation. Well, he gave me impeccable advice on his choice of steak! That steak when it came out was exactly like he had described it...absolutely perfect in every way! It was prepared exactly like I like it! Almost like Pittsburgh style...sorta charred on the outside, & tender & rare on the inside! That was the best steak I think I've ever eaten, & if it wasn't for him recommending that to me, I would have never tried that cut, but he said he gets that all the time & it's a tender cut of meat, so I said ok, I'll try it.  He described that cut  to  a T...it was everything he said it was, then some! It was tender, moist & seasoned perfectly....it just melted in my mouth! It's even more tender than the filet,  which is what I always order , but those days are over! It's skirt steak all the way!! Big kudos to the excellent chefs in the house....thank you for always putting out mouth watering, & tender steaks! And I must say it was the 1st time I've ever gotten a hot steak here, cause normally I order a rare filet which is barely warm, so it was nice to have something different to compare it to. One suggestion I would like to make tho...serving homemade potato chips just doesn't go with steaks! Why can't you give a choice of mashed or baked & if you have to up the prices a few $, I'm ok with that. I just don't think it fits on a plate with a delicious hot steak! Then we had Eric who brought us bread & the water & he was awesome too...totally impressed with the service! Then the little dark complected server...I think she said her name was Renee or her name started with a J?? I can't remember, but they were the only 3 still on the floor, but she was awesome too! She came & took our order without writing anything down & recited back to us our order, & we said yep, that's what we wanted. When our food came, everything was just perfect & the food was out of this world , as usual! The only thing that could use some work is the amount of cauliflower that you get for the side order. I think it was $7-8 , but the portion looked really small this time. I have to get this every time I come, but their wasn't enough there to share...it looked like a 2 oz portion . If your gonna charge $7-8 for a side , then give us our moneys worth, cause at almost $10 for a side item, I wouldn't order that again cause I don't feel you get your moneys worth on it. Maybe it was because it was the end of the night...who knows, but I will give it another try the next time I come in to see if the portion is the same or they give you the portion for 2 people to share. My portion was for 1, anyway, the whole dining experience that night was perfect & just wanted you to know that! Then to top off the evening , our server asked us if we would like some dessert & we said oh no, we're too full, but thank you. He left our table & I assumed he was going to get our check ready, but he impressed me & came back to our table with my birthday dessert of vanilla ice cream with salted Carmel sauce with a lit candle  (to die for) & sat it down in front of me along with 2 spoons!He remembered that it was my birthday & totally surprised me when I had forgotten that's why we came  up to echo & rig for having the best servers in this town!   Buca di Beppo is the same way... I never worry about service when I go there, cause all of their servers are awesome too! Never have to worry about bad service at either restaurant, cause both places have the best servers in this town! Thank you Echo & Rig....you'll always have my loyalty!!",

From making a reservation on the phone to being greeted  at the door to being seated and served throughout, they are friendly, welcoming, accommodating and very knowledgeable - an absolute asset to this restaurant. We were sat upstairs and saw that the atmosphere is quite strange, not to say it's bad, it just feels a little busy and reminds me of eating at a cafe at a train station - open space, people walking past, similar textures. My partner and I tried a variety of small plates. Good prices and good variety, I just didn't like that someone popped by every 10mins to take dishes away that weren't quite empty and that we weren't finished with. Other than that, great!",

    "text": "My second time coming here - first time was for dinner a year ago.  This time was for lunch and I was not disappointed.  I like that I dont have to drive to the strip for a really good steak meal, and parking for Tivoli Village is hassle-free!  Appetizer--Portobello fries with basil aioli is a must have.  There is parmesan on the mushrooms that is really, really good.  We were also going to order crab cakes, but Im glad we didnt, because the bread the bring out with butter, along with the fries were more than enough.  Baverre cut steak--really good.  Our server suggested the charred onion sauce and if you love onions, youd enjoy this sauce.  The steak really didnt need a sauce, but its free, so why not.  The steaks come with these potato chips that I didnt care for, and 1 mushroom rockefeller which was delicious!!! I would have preferred no chips and 2 mushrooms.  Skirt steak--this was so/so...my friend said the Baverre tasted better and Id agree.  She got the lemon chimichurri sauce with it, and it tasted ok, but the steak didnt need it.  Sides--mac & cheese (amazing, very cheesy, I loved it); broccolini (amazing, with a lemon flavor)  Bottomless mimosas--They usually only have the bottomless mimosas on the weekend with their brunch menu, but this was the day after xmas (on a Monday), so they had bottomless mimosas and bloody marys....they give you a full wine glass of the sparkling wine and a very small flute of orange juice and they come by to refill both constantly...honestly, they never refilled my oj because I like my mimosas with minimal juice!! Lol.  Service--a little slow for lunch time on the day after xmas, but we werent in a rush and it allowed us to have more mimosas!!  I will definitely return!",

He went over the entire menu with us, and answered any questions we had. He suggested drinks for the food, and pointed out items we might be interested in. As it was a birthday, he even came by with a birthday treat in the end.   Environment: When we entered we were greeted in a very friendly manner. I liked the butcher feel, and the bar to the side. As we walked upstairs you could tell it was fancy and well out together. Even though we were sitting in the middle it still felt romantic and personal as we ate dinner.  Restaurant is located in Tivoli Village, which has nice shops and is great for walking around.  Food: It is quality you can taste. The sides we had were the mashed potatoes and pork belly. I could have just eaten that pork belly all night long! Then came our steaks. I have not had a more tender well cooked piece of meat since Alberta Beef.  You could tell the butcher knew what he was doing, and the chef did as well. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly to how we wanted it.  The dessert was impeccable as well.   Overall: Worth the trip! Would go back again for our next birthday/anniversary/or Friday.",

    "text": "A pretty decently priced steakhouse in Tivoli Village!  I came here only once last summer with a good friend. We've heard all about how cheap yet delicious the steaks here were so we had to come find out for ourselves.The ambiance has a modern sophisticated feel. The downstairs has a butcher shop and a bar seating area and the upstairs has restaurant seating.  I recall it being packed when we went and we had to wait for a table, but not too long. Everything we ordered came out at a slow place. I can get pretty impatient, but a steakhouse on a busy weekend in Tivoli Village can be understandable.   We ordered a few appetizers and got a bottle of wine. We both went for the ribeye, $35 is a price you can't beat! There was a bit too much salt added for my taste but it was very juicy. (I do like salt so I still devoured my steak). It was a thinner cut of ribeye than what I'm used to at restaurants, but for the deal you're getting it for it doesn't come as a surprise. My only advice would be to order rarer than you'd like. I like mine medium but because of it's thickness it came out closer to medium well. The steak also came out with homemade chips which was different to see paired with steak but nonetheless delicious.   I was telling one of my coworkers who had also tried out Echo & Rig about how I thought their steak was a little salty and she thought that was strange because she thought her steak could have used a little more flavor! Different chefs? Different cuts possibly?   Good price for good quality meat, they just have to master that steak seasoning ;)",

The service was the worst I've ever received. Everything was wrong from the begining. The server and the manager had no clue what the hell was going on.  All they gave us was excuses one after another.  too bad we have 9 ppl in our party so they took advantage of charging 20% tip.

Dishes eaten: - Portabello fries with garlic aiolo sauce: lightly battered mushroom slices, you have to try this; the sauce is bomb - Fried calamari: fresh & flavorful.  Light batting that didn't fall off in the dip. The calamari sans sauce is s still tasty. - grilled cheese sandwich: short ribs, gruyere parmesan & white cheddar.  I still dream about this and want to go back and try it again.   - Jumping beef: not what I expected.  I expected a dry dish with tomatoes and potato, but it was more saucy. - the Tomahawk steak shared family style for was not good by any means.  The steaks are always undercooked when we eat here (for you too?), so over order for what you expect...at least that's what we learned on our 4th trip.

I also tried their Manhattan drink and it was delicious. Not that over powering liquor taste.  This place has its own built in butcher shop. You can order meats to take home if you want! Since they cut their own meat, you can get some unique cuts that aren't served at other places. Best part? Bring your own bottle of wine. No uncorking fee!",

They brought me a salted caramel sundae for dessert for my birthday. My husband drank the house Cabernet & I had a brandy old fashioned. My husband ordered a Dogfish IPA after his wine & it took quite awhile. He asked the server to check on it, he brought it, then the manager stopped by our table to say it was on the house because it took too long.

    "text": "I'm going to start with 4 stars and work our way up. I can't in good conscience give a 5 star review without having a single meat entree. (although I'm tempted to) We ordered the tomato and watermelon salad, portobello fries and veggie chopped salad.  First, this place is the perfect romantic little spot nestled in the front entrance of TiVoli village. They have a butcher shop to the right upon entering. A bar to the left and small table and chairs scattered throughout. It's two stories & so a lot of the remaining seats are upstairs.  The tomato and watermelon salad has chunks of watermelon, tomato, onion, cucumber with a vinaigrette that pairs perfectly against the backdrop of that little summer fruit.  The portobello fries are some of the best I've had. Large and in charge. They come with some green mayo concoction for dipping.  The veggie chop was such a surprise hit!!  It has so many unique adds I had not expected. Snap peas, carrot, green onion, squash and hearts of palm!!!!!! I cannot wait to stop in again, but this time for a full dinner!!!",

    "text": "Echo & Rig - some of the best Food in Las Vegas away from the strip. The service is also outstanding (coming from an ex server in a resort who knows what good service is)  HIGHLY recommend that if you have not come here and are thinking about it, GO! Cheaper than any similar places on the strip, yet higher quality - they butcher and age the meat in house, the side dishes are fresh made and I have yet to have one that didn't wow me! The Caesar salad made with real anchovies, Mac n cheese with real cream and cheese baked with breadcrumbs, spicy cauliflower, and portobello fries are all hits! The steak to have is one they sell out of on a regular basis - you can call ahead and see if they are available - the Rib Eye Cap! Just order it medium, as the chef recommends.   5 stars all day for E&R - will be back many, many times.",

I arrived in jeans praying they wouldn't turn me away and they didn't but you definitely feel a little underdressed. Downstairs is their butcher shop and upstairs is for dining. My second time here and the service is pretty good. Your mimosas never touch the bottom which is always a great thing. (Bottomless is 16 and for bloody Mary's its 22).The food for brunch is mediocre at best. So far we had the steak frites, the New York sandwich and the steakhouse scrambled, all three meals were nothing to brag over. And to be honest, it's very disheartening because the decor and the vibe from this place is awesome.  Maybe I should try the dinner sometime?   So to recap, decor check, service check, food the box remains empty but the bottomless mimosas keep us coming back.  UPDATE: after coming back several times, the food has stepped its game up! The menu remains the same but the seasoning is on point. The service remains up to par and has become a go-to spot for us.",

    "text": "If I could give this place 10 stars I would - I haven't had such phenomenal customer service in a long time.  We went early on a Sunday night for my husband's birthday based on recommendations and Yelp reviews.  We had reservations and this was the first time we had been in this particular shopping center.  Valet parking was easy and convenient and we were seated immediately.  Our hostess asked if we were celebrating a special event and thereafter everyone who came over wished my husband a happy birthday.  Our waiter was extremely courteous, made sure we knew everything was a la carte and made some recommendations.  The whole service team was great.  We ordered the butcher's sausage, bacon and a caesar salad for starters and the southern fried chicken salad, salt & pepper pork chop and a rib eye for the main course.  Dessert was a caramel turtle. The starters were great. I am not sure the bacon was as \"life changing\" as our server mentioned but it was pretty amazing.  I believe the sausage changes weekly - this one was a turkey sausage with Anaheim chilies, it was very tasty.  The Caesar was pretty standard but good.  Everything had lovely presentation.  The main courses arrived promptly.  My pork chop was to die for.  Amazingly tender.  It came with a phenomenal baked apple and some beet greens that I did not care for, but that's me, not the fault of the beet greens or the chef LOL  My mom had the Southern Fried Chicken salad and loved it.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  My husband who ordered the rib eye found the steak to be too salty.  He didn't want to complain because the steak was cooked perfectly but he really wasn't enjoying it so we let the manager know.  The team could not have been more accommodating.  My husband thought maybe it was his taste buds and after tasting my pork chop thought he could easily switch his order to that and be assured he would like it.  The manager however wanted my husband to have what he wanted to eat.  He spoke to the chef that prepared it, explained to my husband how it was prepared and suggested we just ask the chef to cut down the salt a bit.  Honestly, I think my husband just is sensitive to salt, not that the steak itself was over salted.  The managers could not have been more gracious.  They also brought my husband a tomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion salad on the house while he waited for his new steak.  When it arrived (very quickly) my husband couldn't rave enough about it.  It also had a side of perfectly prepared potato chips.  I can't tell you how much we appreciate the management caring about my husband and his experience and never making us feel like we were a bother.    After dinner we were stuffed but they brought my husband a caramel turtle on the house with a candle for his birthday.  OMG, it was the BEST and we managed to eat it all LOL  In addition to the attentive staff, the phenomenal service, and the stellar management, we so appreciated the little details such as the staff folding your napkin when you left the table, the wait to clear the plates until everyone was finished and never feeling rushed to leave even though they were packed. As a plus, the prices were exceptionally reasonable.  We have eaten at Morton's, Flemings, Mastros, etc, and I'd chose Echo & Rig over these anytime.  Thank you Echo & Rig for the excellent food and great service.  We are customers for life.",

Anyway, the menu is not a typical steakhouse menu, everything looks really inviting and interesting. I'll come back and try other things, but I think I could just have a series of veggies. I thought they were that good. The bread was okay but trust me, save your appetite for the menu.  The service was very friendly and attentive. I bit noisy, but they do have an outdoors balcony that is likely quieter. It's misted just in case it's hot.  The menu was at the low end of pricey so don't let the $$$ scare you.",

We walked in without a reservation and only waited about 7 minutes to be seated on a Friday night at 6pm. The three hostesses were welcoming and took down our last name. We checked out the fresh butcher cuts and just enjoyed the lobby area. They have a meat case to peruse and a seafood station. You can purchase meat cuts and goods to take home and prepare yourself. We were seated in an intimate area and a manager or supervisor came by and greeted us and congratulated me on my internship. Our waiters were very accommodating and made us feel high class even though we were in jeans and t shirts. When we come back, we will be sure to dress business casual or nicer! We ordered the roasted broccolini, mashed potatoes, and the Spencer steak (ribeye). Everything was delicious! We didn't have a single leftover, not because of small portions, but because we devoured it all. Bread and beverage refills were frequent and without asking. My girlfriend and I were extremely impressed with the price point, yumminess, and diligence of the staff. We are excited to return for date night!",

The batter was quite thick, and was too salty for my taste. The octopus salad also did not impress. Our favorite side dish was the cauliflower by far.   Main: The 46oz. tomahawk was shared between 4 people (2 men and 2 women). I don't think it was enough for the four of us (even though the server said it'd be plenty of meat)...but I guess it all depends on how big of an eater you are. We ordered medium rare, but was told by our server that medium might be better since it's such a thick piece of meat. We went ahead w medium, and to our surprise, it was quite rare. However, it didn't bother me since I like my meat on the rare side. Overall, it was quite good. The 46oz. tomahawk came out to be $115(ish).   Our total bill was $200(ish)",

But overall everything was amazing, definitely recommend sitting out in the patio beautiful view. And our server Ramon!

I've been coming here with various groups of people for about 3 years now and Sheryl, Beth and Xavier always offer great service and attention. The food is consistently great and the minor detail of the fact that they use actual silverware is the cherry on top for me. I feel I may have told too many people about this place and now I really have to plan ahead to have a large group for a dinner here. First world problems IMO.   The Bavette steak is the fatty goodness a part time carnivore needs to experience. I love that they use poultry from Mary's farm from NoCal and their oysters are always LEGIT fresh. I even brought a doubtful seafood importer here once and he was convinced after trying the oysters.  This spot is way better than any steak joint on the strip and less than half the price. (Literally).  Eat here and get fat. It's worth it.",

I have been here a few times now and each time I have been completely satisfied with the excellent quality they consistently put out and the reasonable price.  I'm not saying that it's my favorite steakhouse, but again, for the money, it is certainly one of the best around!  They are a butcher and a steakhouse.  This makes for a unique feel as you enter, but there's more... The steakhouse means that they have several regular cuts of meat on their menu all the time...the butcher part means that you can order from the shop to-go...but it also means that several additional cuts are available routinely that are not on the menu but sold per ounce.  Steaks are seasoned well and cooked beautifully.  I would not hesitate to order with confidence any cut that you fancy on or off the menu.  The real standouts for me are the small plates.  They have 30 different veggie and small plates that range from $5.50 - $9.30.  On this list you will find such taste-bud copulations as Grilled Octopus w/ Gigante Beans, Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Maryland Lump Crab Cakes, Asparagus & Fried Egg, and their now famous Portobello Fries w/ Aioli...start with these, then venture out to the Sweetbread Nuggets, Steak Tartare, Brussels Sprouts, and Mussels Mainiere...Looks like I need to try more of their veggies next time!  If you are here with a group of 6 - 8 you might want to see what Ribeye Tomahawks they have (or if you happen to eat on your own like a Thunder Cat.)  This cut receives nice flavor from the bone and marbling, and slices up nice to share.  All of their steaks come with the option of the following sauces: Blue Cheese, Red Wine Demi, Green Pepercorn, Bernaise, Charred Onion, Horseradish Cream, or Lemon Chimichurri...I'm a succker for the more traditional Bernaise.  E&R is a great place to take a date and share some of the small plates...or come with a group and order by the ounce.  Did I mention that they don't have a corkage fee here?...well they don't, so bring in your favorite bottle of vino.  They also have some incredible looking Happy Hour prices, but I have not sampled any of these options. I have however tried the wonderful boutique hand scrubs in the restrooms, and I'm a fan.  Come here for remarkable food for the price point Come here with a group open to sharing and trying a lot of options Come here for fancy hand creams in the bath room Come here for a trendy date spot with a modern distressed interior Either way...you should come check it out  #200thReview  #OnlyTakesMeThreeTimesAsLongAsNelsonQToGet200Done",

I don't know if the management knew that's what their employees been telling customers.... I dont think ask for more gratitude is the right attitude, that should leave for customer if they felt they received outstanding service and extra care!",

    "text": "I dined at this restaurant a month ago with a party of 10 for my friend's birthday dinner. We were served by an older gentlemen (never got his name) and he was absolutely amazing. He brought out the thick cuts of steaks to our table and gave us the whole presentation of how they are prepared and served. Me not being a meat eater and having no clue of the difference in cuts of meat and so forth was fascinated by the fact that he took the time to explain this information in detail to our table. My friends ended up ordering different cuts of rib eye, which they all loved. I ordered the portabello fries, mac and cheese, and cauliflower side dishes. Everything was delicious. This was my 5-star experience. I loved the service and food so much that I decided to come back the following night with my boyfriend and his mother. This, unfortunately, is where my experience went from 5 stars to 1. We were seated and introduced to our waiter (caucasian mid 30's looking, also didn't get his name). This waiter did not have a pleasant demeanor like the older gentlemen the night before had. No smile, no welcome, no warmth, he was very cold. He gave us our menus and never mentioned or brought out the presentation of steaks. I questioned him about the steak presentation when he took our orders, I informed him it was my boyfriend's and his mother's first time being there and I wanted them to see the different cuts of steak. He told us that since they both wanted different types of steaks and at different temperatures (medium rare and well done) there was really no point in bringing them out (those steaks are meant to be shared). Ok.. good point. However, I feel that it should've been offered as an option prior to taking their orders so they can decide if they wanted to order them or not. Anyways, they ended up ordering the filet tenderloin and double ranch rib eye (they were out of the rib eye cap). I ordered cauliflower side, mac and cheese and caesars salad. When the food came out, my boyfriend couldn't eat his rib eye because it was extremely tough. I couldn't eat the cauliflower dish because it was overly burnt. Did our waiter ever once come by the table after the food was brought to check on us? No, he did not. Not even one glance. My boyfriend placed his steak on the side of the table hoping to grab the waiter's attention. More than 5 minutes went by when finally Xavier, the assistant general manager addressed if there was a problem with my boyfriend's steak. My boyfriend told him that the steak was too tough to chew and wanted to order the tenderloin instead. Xavier apologized and graciously took his request and reordered him the tenderloin. When the waiter brought out the tenderloin, he told us that the other steak was probably too tough because it was medium rare and the fat didn't render. This information would've been great while we were ordering since none of us knew this. I also pointed out to the waiter that my cauliflower was burnt and he apologized and brought out a new unburnt dish. Round 2.. again, the waiter never checked on my boyfriend to see how he liked the tenderloin.  Good thing Xavier was there, he made sure my boyfriend was satisfied. Which he was, he said the tenderloin was very good. When it was time for dessert, the waiter came by and dropped off the dessert menu. He didn't put it in our hand, he didn't go over the different desserts, he simply set the menu on the table and walked away. WOW. When I read these bad reviews on Yelp about customer's getting terrible service, I bet you anything, it is this same waiter. Although his service was horrendous, I still tipped him over 20% because that's how I am. Who knows, maybe he was having a bad day, month, year? All I can say is that I can't believe I had 2 very opposite experiences at this restaurant. If it wasn't for the great hospitality and service of Xavier, our night would've been ruined. He is the reason I am giving this restaurant 3 stars instead of 2. There is no doubt that the food is delicious but a dining experience is not only about the food, but also the service which makes it an entire experience. Needless to say, I was embarrassed that I recommended this restaurant to my boyfriend and his mother, I said nothing but great things about this restaurant and set their expectations high. Unfortunately, we won't be dining here again.",

    "text": "I really like this place. A couple of friends and I came here for brunch on Sunday.   Upon entering the lobby area, the butcher shop was on the right, and the hostess and bar, to the left. I loved the modern-rustic decor and the ambiance of the place. We were seated upstairs in the loft. There are elevators to the right, if you do not want to take the stairs. There is also balcony seating, but a bit too windy for me, so inside was nice.   We had the Smoked Salmon Benedict, Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, the Waffle, and a side of the 1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! The only complaint would be the Bloody Mary; it was a bit too bland for me. They could probably spruce it up by adding a square piece of bacon with the olive. They are a butcher shop, after all. Anyway, service was very good and there was a \"Brand Ambassador\" walking around making sure guests were happy (I think that's code for General Manager). Overall, I recommend this place and look forward to coming back for dinner. I can't wait to try their steaks!",

    "text": "Echo and Rig started out as a 5 star for me, however they have not kept up with the same standards that they had originally started with in both aspects of service and quality. A dinner here will run you about 50pp with drinks and a few appetizers.   On multiple visits I have been served food that had been sitting out. I am not one to send something back but had to on my last visit because I could not stand paying good money for what I was being served. The server happily took it back and apologized after he touched the plate and realized that I was right.   Regardless.... The layout of the restaurant is stunning. When you enter the restaurant you are checked in downstairs where you will find their butcher shop, then walked up the stairs by a hostess where you will find an open kitchen and dining area with a gorgeous patio overlooking the tivoli fountains (Not much of a view, but they definitely worked with what they had).  Echo and Rig is a great spot to have a casual lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate a special occasion. I loved the concept that they had going and the different menu items that they tried to push, especially when it came to their smaller appetizer plates but if I had to spend 100+ on a meal I'd look for another spot.",

We sat on the outdoor balcony which was very pleasant. Probably well known for their bottomless mimosas for just $16. Our server was not as pleasant as the water guy but she seemed to warm up a lot towards the end of our meal. We ordered the short rib hash  that had a good mix of Yukon potatoes, veggies and 2 poached eggs (very tasty but would have been good with a splash of sriracha), the farm fresh   breakfast (also with 2 located eggs and goat cheese)which was more flavorful than the hash, and the blueberry buttermilk pancakes which were great since they had blueberries cooked in the batter plus fresh blueberries on the side and even some dropped in the syrup as well. A big plus for me since i say the more blue berries the better! Price was very reasonable $9 - $15 average. I'd come back!",

We happened to be in the area on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS...  On our first attempt, we call in just to confirm that they are doing happy hour. The woman on the other line says yes, gives us a rundown of the days, hours, items, etc.  Upon arrival, the hostess(maybe the same person we spoke to earlier) apologizes to us saying that there will be NO HAPPY HOUR because there was a \"Back of the house brawl\" type contest going on!?!? I was so ready to brawl with one of the sides of beef  hanging in the butcher shop Rocky Balboa style!!! Did we not just speak to you over the phone? Or was it another airhead that we called where our conversation went in one ear and out the other?  Time passes, and we decide to give it another go after a great evening(so far) this time, after waiting about 10 minutes one of the waiters drops off a dinner menu, and mentions that we can order anything off the dinner menu!?!? We try and get answers to what's going on, and I overhear him telling two other parties across from us(who also came for HH) that they are NOT serving the Happy Hour items. We express our disappointment that this is the second time we came here, and again we are denied? WTH??? The waiter AND bartender were supposedly going to check with the manager on duty to get some answers. Within that 18 minute span, the bartender whips up a complimentary ladies' cocktail for Wifey, and tries to get my drink order...TWICE and I politely tell him that I'd like to order some food first, because at this point, we still didn't have answers. We flagged the Hostess down and  hoped that she could get us answers. She disappears upstairs TWICE for a few minutes, and upon her return, this is what she told us: (**The manager on duty never came down because he was \"tied up\" on a phone call-at 10:30 pm? Right...)  \"The cook who manages the Happy Hour Menu had an emergency and we are short staffed, HUH??? The Hostess also softly \"but my manager said it would be okay to order the HH Hot Dogs.\" What's this? A pity party/consolation prize??? At this point, it was just ridiculous. So you mean to tell me that there is NO ONE on the line that can duplicate the Happy Hour items except for the cook who went home? Let's see...there's the Executive Chef, Sous Chef, and Lead Cooks in each station...Three smaller, easier items cannot be duplicated, but you are still able to cook anything off a bigger dinner menu? It just makes no sense. In every kitchen I've worked in, we served every item on the menu regardless if  we were short staffed or not.   I'm even gonna side with John Curtas and agree that the butcher shop is not the brightest thing in that spot right now. Why not do like your big brother Bottega Louie <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bottega-louie-los-angeles\">yelp.com/biz/bottega-lou...</a> and put in a patisserie??? Not only is Bottega Louie making a daily killing from all their desserts and pastries, they are nearing almost 8000 reviews which makes them one of the most, if not THE MOST Yelped business! It definitely beats staring at carcasses and cuts of raw meat IMO... Let's hope you can get some consistency in your food and service, but for now, I'm VERY disappointed in you Echo & Rig...ALOHA!!!

I purchased 2 whole chickens (cut up), 3 pounds of bacon, a pack of sweet Italian sausage and a quart of beef bone broth.   I am thoroughly impressed. The butcher that was working at the counter was very very helpful. I had a few questions, and he was more than happy to help. He had no problem separating the chickens I purchased and even threw in the bones. (Chicken bone broth!)  I have already eaten some of the chicken, along with a bit of the bacon. It tasted fresh and tender. Obviously the cooking method plays a role, but the quality of the meat was amazing. The bacon was flavorful and delicious. A great addition to my brussel sprouts.   Anyway, I will be back regularly. If anything, to just to grab reasonably priced pasture raised meat. I feel great about my purchase and I am so glad I found this place!",

The dining area is on the smaller side, but it is all very open and airy.  When we arrived, we were informed that the wait was about an hour. Yikes! Granted, it was 7:20 on a Saturday night, but I wasn't expecting so long of a wait. But we were there, we were hungry, and we were not to be dissuaded from our plan. So, we moseyed up to the bar for a cocktail. I enjoyed the Strawberry Bliss, while my companion had the White Sangria. Both of the drinks were very well crafted, and all of the bartenders were really friendly and personable. I always enjoy when I can see them muddling ingredients and putting drinks together with care. My companion made an off-handed comment about the sangria being full of ice and not enough drink (because it was so good), and the bartender fixed him another at no charge! It wasn't even a complaint, and we certainly weren't expecting that.  The wait only ended up being about 35 minutes, and we were escorted upstairs to the dining room by the hostess. We were seated in a very cosy corner with the booth portion accented by lots of cute (and comfy) pillows.  Our server, Ramon, was very nice and made some recommendations for us. He was also serving a very large party near us, so service was on the rather leisurely (slow-ish) side.  The bread wasn't anything special, but it was soft in the middle, which I appreciated. It was served room temperature.  We initially started our meal with the octopus, which was one of Ramon's picks (he talked us out of the calamari). Unfortunately, it wasn't what we expected and it wasn't exactly to our liking. It actually was like an octopus salad, with white beans and a light vinegar sauce. The octopus didn't have much flavor and was rather chewy.  This was the only negative portion of our meal. We mentioned to Ramon that we didn't really like it, and he brought out an order of calamari at no charge. The calamari was delicious! Hot, lightly breaded, and had two sauces that were equally good.  The main course.... STEAK! I got the ribeye, medium-rare, while my companion got the Spencer steak, medium. Both steaks are served with a large mushroom with breadcrumbs in it and chips. The chips seemed rather unnecessary, but they were fine. The steaks... absolutely delicious! They were highly seasoned (if you don't like salt, this may not be the right choice), and cooked perfectly. We also got a side of the portobello fries (essentially deep fried mushrooms). They were very tasty, but I don't know if I'd order them again.  Throughout our meal, one of the managers circulated to check on every table and make sure everyone was enjoying their meal, which was a nice touch.   Echo & Rig had SO many yummy sounding things on their menu, that I definitely would love to return to try some more of their offerings.",

    "text": "Yep - a fan. (thanks yelp for making the quickie comments easy!)  Only one visit so far but will happily go back. The service as a whole was stellar, hostesses, sommelier - fab. Our server specifically - could have been better. When dining on christmas eve...all is forgiven.   made resos three days before..thanks for accommodating us!   three diners this outing, we ordered for starters - portobello fries (great), pork belly, w/grits (ehh?) - maybe the menu should have said the reverse, what was delivered was way more grits/polenta - so, this is how i think of this side. and mac & cheese - should have moved this to come with our main.  *i was wrangled in :( on my ordering of sides..  for din din - broccolini with garlic and mashied potatios (mash pots - for the needy) both decent.   our party of  our three, we ordered two caps and i ordered the strip.  Steaks are \"wood grilled\" - okay, probably more char and a tiny bit more well done that you would usually have, just listen to your server, that is what they are here for. - my strip was good at medium rare, the caps (swanky butchers cut), was good. cap was better that night at the restaurant, my leftover strip was better the next day (as leftovers, just saying!)   happily go back, hope this local endevour makes it - real output, real delivery.   the take home bags while extremely fancy, the bags themselves, reminds you..what you have actually paid for, glamour, in packaging, but certainly worth the visit - happier experience, good, happy family, happy me.",

    "text": "My first time here was the only time I've had a great experience.   The sides, steak and service were superb.    Came back after hearing everyone talk about their $1.99 \"Happy Hour\".   We were unsuccessful not once, but twice, and the first time they had an excuse about some private function blah blah blah, yet when we called ahead of time there was no mention of this.  Second time we could not call ahead due to a recording being the only answer so decided to show up anyway.   It was exactly 10 pm and asked the host about the \"Happy Hour\" and she said \"yes of course you may sit anywhere in the bar area\". So we proceeded and then waited 11 minutes for a menu and then when it finally arrived we looked it over only to find no mention of this \"Happy Hour\".   We asked the waiter for that menu and said \"Oh, let me check because I don't think we are serving that menu tonight\" What??  Yes, please check.   A second waiter came to ask for our drink order and again I asked and this time I was told \"Oh, we are not serving that menu tonight\".  When I mentioned that this was the second time we were being denied this menu he said he would go check to see what he could do....18 minutes later the first waiter came back to try to take our order again, really?? Again I repeated myself about waiting for an answer and could tell he never asked anyone about it.   So third time's the charm, and asked the hostess about the menu and said \"Maam we are not serving that menu but you can order anything off the regular full menu\"  She sensed my disappointment and before I could say another word I heard once again \"Let me check with our manager\" Oh geez at this point I wanted to walk out but instead decided to be humored yet again with their lack of urgency on a response.   And she did not disappoint.   She quickly said the manager is tied up on a phone call but said that the cook who manages the happy hour menu had an emergency (that no one knew about up to this point) and left early, but said we could have a hot dog...really??? As consolation??? No thank you.  You can offer me the whole menu and you are not short staffed there but can't manage the \"Happy Hour\" menu??? You must think it's my first time out!!!   This establishment should really think about mentioning that services is subject to change or per availability",

    "text": "Got there yesterday as my first year of anniversary with my girlfriend. made a reservation with Christine, which was a perfect communication that I had with her. Got there, our hostess greeted us and recognized us by the time of reservation, which was impressive. We were asked to be waited one or two minutes. And since it was our first time being there, we wanted to walk around to see what they have in butcher shop, which was impressive. After a minute, we have been guided to 2nd floor where restaurant is located. Our server was Hugo. He was well groomed, and seemed like he knows his own stuff. He was really attentive and amazing. The best part of this place is complimentary corkage fee. Their manager greeted us and insisted whether or not he can open the bottle for us, which was great. We ordered few things.  Steak Tartare - 5 / 5. Meat was fresh, it harmonized with lemon scent with toasted baguette. Fried Calamari - 5 / 5. TBH nothing special, but as long as we enjoyed it, I would give 5 Fillet Mignon - 5 / 5. Ordered medium rare with blue cheese sauce, it was cooked perfectly, tender.  Rib eye Cap - 3 / 5 Ordered medium rare with mushroom sauce, sauce was amazing, but steak by itself, it was too salty. I asked our server to see if this is supposed to be a bit salty, and been informed that it is supposed to be but maybe cook has put a bit more salt for seasoning than it is supposed to be.  Comp. Sundae - 5 / 5 comp is always great no matter what. Right? lol  Overall, great place, staffs there, they seemed to be happy also. It was great experience, and I will definitely come back. But I will make sure that I won't order Rib eye Cap though.  Ask for the server Hugo, he is just awesome.",

The hostess said to let her know when one more person arrived. Right at 10 let her know our 4th has arrived. Waited 26 minutes before finally being sat. Hopefully the rest of the experience doesn't follow suit.   Previous Review:  Everything is so amazing. I always get the tri-tip with the caramelized onion sauce. Portobello Fries are amazing. The grilled cauliflower is amazing. The seabreeze drink is amazing. Everything is amazing. Come here all the time. The new blonde manager was extremely friendly and introduced herself, the seabreezes made me forget her name. Our waiter was very attentive as was the buster that was constantly cleaning the table.   On a side note, the hostess was extremely professional. There was another lady ahead of us that was complaining about waiting for 10 minutes  to be seated and was extremely snarky and rude to the hostess. The hostess just smiled and apologized and remained professional.   We will be back, as always!!!",

Don't be nervous that this is so far off strip. It's worth the drive or Uber ride.  We arrived a full hour before our reservation but the staff was able to accommodate us :) we started with a drink at the downstairs bar before we headed up to our lovely table.  Hugo our waiter was amazing and the restaurant manager came to check in on us and together they made our evening spectacular!  Despite being two people we wanted to try everything! We started with the portobello fries with the herb aioli. It's to die for. Crunchy, light and the sauce added a level of creaminess that cut through the batter to keep it fresh. Next we had the thick cut bacon. OMG, perfect little bites of crispy fat to meat ratio. Our course we had to have a Caesar salad since that is my favorite and it was perfectly dressed and seasoned! Oh yeah and order the bone marrow. Two generous bones filled deep with marrow!  Finally the main course! We did the special 48 oz tomahawk steak with a side of creamed kale, roasted cauliflower and mac and cheese. Get your steak cooked medium even if you like medium rare as it is a large steak. My husband loved the rib cap which was slightly charred and well seasoned. I loved the middle pieces which were more lean but perfectly medium rare. Delicious!! We wished we brought our dog to Vegas as he would have enjoyed the bone.  And we still had dessert! If you like ice cream the Carmel turtle sundae was so delicious. I also had a cappuccino made with half and half for good measure.  Everything we ordered was amazing but there are still many things we weren't able to try.  Do yourself a favor, rent a car, make a reservation and come with a hungry stomach. This place is amazing and one of now must eat places on Vegas!  And if you are celebrating a special occasion let the staff know as they love helping you make it a night to remember!",

First of all let me mention, from top to bottom and beginning to end, every single person was GLORIOUS, attentive, thoughtful, and at the top of their game.  Hannah (the hostess), then Raelynda (our waitress), all the runners and bussers, and finally Xavier, the Assistant General Manager; each person was a finely tuned instrument in a superb orchestra making it a perfect evening.  We hit tons of traffic on the way, and so we were 20 minutes late to our reservation. I had called ahead to warn them but still didn't have high hopes, but Hannah kept us in the queue, and we received a table almost immediately. We had to make a 7:30 curtain for a show, so we had only precisely an hour to get a meal in, and Raelynda was incredible at expediting the entire dinner yet not making us feel rushed. She also made excellent suggestions and maneuvered our party's long list of dietary restrictions with aplomb!  Everything was delicious and impeccable: some of the dishes (pictured) we sampled were: Colorado Lamb Porterhouse Chops peewee potatoes, dried apricots & violet mustard; Asparagus & Fried Egg; Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar; Lamb Cigars & Tzatziki Sauce; I also had 9 oysters from the raw bar - fresh and yummy!  The Rye Manhattan was also so ambrosial that I had to order a second!  This place should unquestionably have an honored place on your list of trusted regular haunts!!! GO GO GO!!!",

    "text": "We went here in Sunday evening, Father's Day. My son, from Cali, was taking us there for dinner. He has been super jazzed about going to this steakhouse.   Well I must say the food was great!!  Excellently prepared, super good, and a nice dinner. The prices are reasonable for what you get. One minor disappointment were the accompaniments with the steak. I got the ribeye and it was excellent but it came with their homemade potato chips. My wife had the lamb chops and they were.excellent also. My son and his wife shared a large tomahawk ribeye which was very good also.   The only downer for the evening was our service. We can't blame the waitress because she said she had 8 tables. And the place was not super crowded. Anyway we were waiting for her to take our drink order, food order, and then the bill. In our opinion 8 tables was way too many for one person.  Overall it was a good experi nce and the food was great. Would we go back again, maybe but not sure.",

But we figure if we had gone to a steak restaurant on the strip our meals would have been so much more it evened out.  The service was amazing, the manger came over - gave us his card, poured us all a glass of sparkling wine.  (we saw him bring a blanket out to someone on the patio)  We sat upstairs - I was facing the kitchen which I love, but it was in a bit of an open area, outside might have been amazing.  We ordered as follows: - Portobello fries - I have never seen these on a menu before and I eat out a fair bit, super crunchy - Arugula salad, nice and light -Asparagus with a egg - OH MY! 1 got the (famous here, and limited quantites per night) - Rib Eye cap, I liked it a lot, my friend said hers was a little salty -also we split the mashed potatoes - were lovely - and a nice portion for 3 people to split - we didn't finish them.  It was a very reasonable dinner $$ - but like I said get there via Lyft or Uber!",

    "text": "There's SO much to say about our wonderful experience here, but I will touch on the highlights:  Called to make a reservation, and the hostess was very warm & friendly. She even asked if it was a special occasion (it was) and she let me know that we would be well taken care of. And we were from the moment we arrived.   Our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable when it came to suggestions on the menu. What a GREAT menu! It was really hard to settle on food to order, everything sounded amazing. We started with sangrias (which were actually more like wine spritzers, the only weak part of our dinner) but they were ok. We then ordered Caesar salads, vegetables, a ridiculously good Mac & Cheese and also mashed potatoes to go with our steaks. Also a round of red wine, which was very nice.   It proceeded to get really warm where we were sitting indoors, and about that time a manager made his rounds to our table to ask about our dinner. We were loving our dinner and service, but asked about the air conditioning, and he immediately went to take care of it. Within a few minutes we could feel cool air flowing again, and he came back again to check on us. It was obvious to us that he genuinely cared about our dining experience. Unbeatable high standards for Vegas dining. Just perfect.   We were also spoiled with a gorgeous surprise dessert on the house in celebration of our anniversary. Very touching.   EVERYONE we came into contact with here was just amazing at what they do! We left a large tip in gratitude for the great night we had here.   We were beyond impressed with the staff, the food and the location. As locals, we are so happy to find this beautiful place and we hope to be back often and share this experience with our family & friends.   Thank you to everyone here that made our anniversary so memorable! You are very special people and we are very thankful!",

    "text": "Amazing!   Absolutely loved our experience. From the hostess, to the manager (who \"touched\" every table! Way to go), the bussers, the cocktail server, and our server everyone was wonderful and beyond friendly and attentive but not pushy or nosy.   The food was very good too.   The pea gnocchi: wonderful! A must get for appetizer  The bone marrow carne asada: I'm not a fan of bone marrow texture from anywhere but this flavor was amazing and my boyfriend lovedddd this  The Mac and cheese: cheesy goodness   The pork belly: make sure to get a bite of the fatty side with the tougher side and it's heaven   Both rib eyes: sooo good. I got the fattier cut and it was to die for! Listen to what the server says about how it should be cooked, based on what the chef says. They know best.   The chips that come with the meat: beyond delicious. I had to take them home with us they were that good.   A little insider note: they don't have a corkage fee, so if you're a wine drinker bring your own bottle and drink it with dinner.   The only sad note was the lack of dessert choices. I was kind of expecting some different choices seeing as there are a lot of wonderful culinary experiences on the menu. But I'm sure dessert is good just wasn't what we were looking for.   Highly recommend!  We will be back!",

The exterior and interior of the restaurant is very inviting. There is a second floor with a balcony, so it's such a cute place to eat.   The first time I ate there, I went for brunch with my friends and saw that they had hashed short ribs and poached eggs on the menu! Of course I had to try it. Anything with short ribs is always delicious!  On top of that, the service was awesome. The servers and manager are super accommodating. They gave my friend a complimentary birthday sundae of her choice instead of the standard birthday cake. When you go, make sure you try the Caramel Turtle sundae! You're not going to want to share.",

You will never see a finished plate, empty glass or scrap on your table for more than 2 seconds before someone comes by and cleans it up or asks if you would want another drink. Food was great. Highly recommend and def will be back! 1 star off because we didn't like the steak it was a bit chewy.  I will def come back to try the Sunday brunch !!",

I can't comment on the food because we weren't there long enough to order any. We made a reservation to celebrate my husband's birthday. This would have been our first time visiting, and we're not aware of the outside seating. When making the reservation, we were never advised of outdoor seating or that we would only be allowed an hour to eat. After waiting 15 minutes to be seated, we are walked outside to the patio in 100 degree weather. There were no misters or fans, and not one time were we asked if we preferred to sit outside. Some of our party had medical issues and were not able to sit in 100 degree weather. When asked if we could move inside, we were advised there were no available seating (in which there was 3 large tables open). We were then told that it would be an additional 20 minute wait AND we still needed to eat and leave by within the hour. We opted to leave and not to do business with an establishment who refused to notify us of outdoor seating, or that they would be closing the restaurant at 1pm on this particular day. As we moved back inside we noticed the 3 empty tables but were advised that they were no longer seating anyone at those tables due to the private event. We politely went to another restaurant who was happy to accommodate a party of 10 indoors. As a customer service manager, I would never spend my money where bad service is rendered.",

Lamb chops were the best we've ever had. Charred well and cooked to perfection!  Special thank you to our server (I believe his name was Nicolas) and the rest of the wait staff. Friendly, attentive, excellent service. Nicolas was extremely knowledgeable, and explained how some dishes were prepared, whether sou vide, or charred on the grill, ect.

You lose count of how many you drank because they refill your glass before it empties. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but I always have a good time.  I change up what I eat all the time, but have always loved what I've gotten. My favorite is the \"Grilled Cheese,\" which sounds basic, but it's so good!  I always make a reservation because they get busy on weekends.",

This particular trip was for my friends early 24th birthday brunch. Once the party arrived, we followed the hostess upstairs and saw the personalized menus for the affair. I LOVED seeing those!! I love the details people may forget about during happy events such as this, so seeing the restaurant have these customized and placed for everyone was wonderful.   The manager (I believe her name is Beth, apologies if I'm wrong!) greeted our table and introduced herself. I love that she takes the time to do this, not only for our event/party but to all tables as well. Even when I was here before with a smaller group, she came by and I really appreciate that extra step.   For brunch, we were given four entree options. Since I'm allergic to raw eggs (and potentially Hollandaise sauce) I chose the Steakhouse Scramble. It was just as awesome as the last time I had it. To compliment our main dishes we were served Kennebec, Roasted Breakfast Potatoes and Bacon, family style. I also enjoyed the bottomless mimosas and I appreciated how my glass was rarely empty thanks to the constant refills.   I will constantly recommend Echo & Rig to any friends or family, especially if they're looking for a place with exceptional service and food.",

    "text": "Our first visit to E&R was about a year ago for my wife's birthday, and it was very disappointing overall. The food was decent enough, even for the price, but the service was horrible. It took over 3 hours to have dinner due to waiting, order issues and having one of the worst waiters you could possibly imagine. But I refrained from ever finishing my review and decided to give them another shot. It took a while, but we came back and chose a Sunday to check out their pretty highly praised brunch.  Right off the bat, things were starting out way better than our first visit, and was quite possibly some of the best service I've ever gotten. We walked in at about 10:30am, the hostess took our name and got us seated in less then 10 minutes. They were able to get us a nice seat on the patio and just moments after being sat down we were greeted by the manager, who knew our names. Shortly after that, our waiter (who also had our names by the way) came to take our drink order. He asked if we'd dined at E&R before, and when we told him only for dinner, he went through the brunch menu and explained some of their most popular items. During our whole brunch, every person who came to our table knew our name and were as friendly as could be. It was very impressive and a complete 180 from prior experience, but then the food came...  As per the waiters suggestion, I ordered one of their signature dishes, the Short Rib Hash. For $15 you get a healthy portion of short rib, finely diced potatoes and veggies, poached eggs and a smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. What made the dish so disappointing was the fact that half of it seemed to have sat under a heater or something for too long. Basically half of the plate was excellent...the short ribs were moist and tender, the potatoes had a nice little crisp to them, and the egg was poached perfectly. Then I got to the other half of the dish. All the meat was dry and crispy, and the egg was way overcooked. It was nearing hard boiled egg, complete with a cooked yoke. For me, those things combined just through the dish way off and was such a major let down compared to the other half I'd just eaten.   We also ordered a side of their thick cut bacon, which rings in at $8. They bring out a nice stack of grilled bacon served with a side of BBQ dipping sauce. This bacon is definitely thick, and has a nice charred flavor and texture from the grill. It was fatty, tender and even though I'm not a huge BBQ sauce fan, it complimented the overall flavor nicely. It's something I'd definitely order again.  For what Echo & Rig is, their inconsistency issue are crazy. We had a great steak with terrible service once, and then came back to less then stellar food, but impeccable service. Obviously this restaurant is a bit on the \"higher end\", but if you're going to charge $15 for a breakfast hash, you better be able to properly poach an egg. I can only speak for myself, but half a decent dish and a tasty side of bacon certainly isn't going to get me to come back alone. And because we had such a bad experience during dinner, I'm not so sure a 3rd visit for any meal would be a charm.",

It's fairly romantic inside at night, and everyone is either dressed fancy or in their casual, yet appropriate Sunday clothes.   I would suggest this for an intimate date night. 3rd or 4th date, maybe? It's a \"will you be my girl?\" or a \"fancy some dinner after work, dear?\" kinda place.   Service: 5 - Like I have said many times before, no one knows service like Summerlin does. This place is just excellent. The servers basically treat you like you are the only table they have. He was quick and efficient, except at the end, where he took a while to get us our check. It was just so refreshing to have amazing service for once. Probably the best service I have received at a restaurant in my life.   Food: 2 - We ordered the Spencer Steak, The Rib-eye Cap, Calamari, Portobello Fries,  Crab Cake, and Pork Belly.   I thought my Spencer Steak and Pork Belly was a little dry. The pork was definitely overcooked and a bit hard. I don't know if it was just that day, but I was pretty disappointed..it just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.   The best thing I had that day was the Portobello Fries. Don't let the rest of the review fool you. The fries were REALLY GOOD. They should have given me two! Portobello Fries for life!!",

Reservations for a 12:30 brunch was easy (thank you Open Table).  All of the staff was wonderful and welcoming.  We were seated inside right away next to the window overlooking Tivoli Village and were given the choice of complementary sparking or flat water.  The space was open and not too noisy.  Now about the food:  Portobello Mushroom Fries - Probably the highlight of our meal.  This dish was jam packed full of flavor and perfectly battered and fried.  It went amazingly well with the aioli dipping sauce.  This is a definite must if you visit.  Smoked Salmon Benedict - One of the more expensive brunch menu items, but oh so worth it.  The eggs were perfectly poached and I loved that it came with a potato pancake instead of the usual English muffin. Smoked Salmon and healthy portion of spinach were great as well.  It was filling and tasty and I would recommend it to others   Steak Scramble - This dish was unfortunately disappointing.  The server said it was one of the two most popular dishes (the other was the short rib hash).  The portion was smaller than expected and flavor wise it just couldn't keep up with the other dishes.    Since we were celebrating our anniversary we were given a complementary dessert and we choose the Chocolate Cherry Sundae. It was such a nice treat and such a sweet way to end our meal.  It was a lovely restaurant and I hope to be back in the future to try more of the menu.",

Don't be shy trying any of the tapas, the flavors are endless. For sure try the cauliflower and carrots. You'll want seconds. .maybe thirds.  The avocado toast is great and comes with sheshito peppers...awesome combo.  Lamb cigars are also good. Been here multiple times, on different days.  Sundays is pretty happening. Lots more people and a little more noise, but don't let that deter you.   They won't be understaffed, and you'll get taken care of.   For a large menu,  the dessert options are pretty minimal.  If you're not into ice cream or sherbet, skip it and go somewhere else. I love ice cream, and anytime i can get espresso ice cream,  that's a win.   Their cappuccino sundae is great! So is the cherry sundae.  I will be back...hoping to try the brunch.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying that my rating is for my entire experience at this establishment not just the food.   I visited Echo and Rig with my family to celebrate a birthday, after a friend recommended we try it.  I went it with high expectations as the other reviews I read were good and this friend suggested that they had great food. Well the food was great however it is the service and overall experience that left myself and everyone in my party disappointed. Upon calling to make a reservation and entering the restaurant you are treated like you are a regular and the staff interactions are positive. I was assured by the manager on the phone prior to dining that my dairy allergy would not be a problem and they would easily be able to accommodate it.   The service simply went downhill from there. I will keep it short as no one wants to read a review full of complaints but I want to share my experience so others are aware. We were rushed, not checked on regularly by our server, the staff were constantly whispering in the corner and pointing at tables, and above all the staff is not educated about and does not handle food allergies appropriately.  A few examples about the service: - Our waiter seemed annoyed with the ordering process and instead of helping us - a larger party who had not dined there previously he rushed us into ordering. He spoke so quickly that no one could understand or hear what he was saying. In addition when the person paying the bill tried to order another side for the table he stopped her and said \"I think we are good on sides\". If she wants to order the whole menu that should not be a problem for you the server who will benefit from a higher bill in the end. If you think it is too much food then there is a way to say it to the party but at the same time if someone wants one of everything that should be up to them.   - The manager who was very nice when we walked in did not stop at our table once throughout the time we were there. He walked around the restaurant looking at tables and refilling waters but failed to ask our table how everything was or if there is anything we needed. In addition he stood constantly in plain view of all tables talking with staff and pointing and glaring at certain tables. This felt awkward and rude. In my opinion all of this is restaurant management 101.   A note for anyone dining at this restaurant with a FOOD ALLERGY. Be careful and explicit when you order because it seems the waitstaff are not knowledgable or worried about allergies. Any time I have dined at a steakhouse I have had no problem with staff accommodating my dairy allergy. Whether it is by sharing items with me that are not made with dairy, talking to the chef or manager about what could be made to accommodate me or as I have had at many establishments the manager or chef come speak with me directly to come up with a fabulous meal that I could enjoy. None of that happened here. I had to have a plain steak and a salad while everyone at the table enjoyed the food (that looked and smelled wonderful). And the kicker was that when I physically went to find and check with our server about my order to double check that my food would not contain dairy (because I felt like he rushed me at the table) he said to \"just don't eat the mushroom that would be placed on my plate as it will contain dairy\". Furious at this point I explained to him that my plate should not have ANYTHING dairy on it!!! The cherry on top was at the end of the meal he had the balls to make a comment which I interpreted as passive aggressive that we should be sure to come back to visit again and make sure to see him so he can accommodate my allergy.   Overall the food was good but the service left much to be desired. In the future I will likely choose to visit one of the many of the other fine dining establishments in the area.",

Cooked to perfection, smooth, juicy, and flavorful - this thing was ridiculous!  Restaurant was a little noisy (due to the acoustics no doubt), however, the service is totally on point.  I'm not sure if the staff is trained to shake the customer's hand (upon greeting), but I'm not a fan of this practice.  Nothing personal, but I don't like touching strangers before I eat.  Will I go back?  Heck yes.  Total cost for two (including one drink and one side) was $98 - very reasonable.  Well worth the trip from the strip!

Appetizers/sides included grilled cauliflower and and lightly fried mushrooms, mashed potatoes, baby carrots, and roasted Brussels sprouts, all magnificent! There was a large wine selection, as well as local and West Coast craft beers. Their Happy Hour is also excellent with great discounts on selected wines, beers and mixed drinks, with food specials at $1.99 including shrimp cocktail and mini steak and egg that is delicious! We had ice cream sundaes, with a variety of their excellent ice creams and ices, finished off with fine coffee. All in all, a fabulous experience was had by all.

The hostess did not offer us any options, which got us off to a pretty poor start.  After being seated it all went Fabulous!!  The dishes are very tasty and flavorful. Organic Grass Fee Beef was very good. They have butchers on the premises and offer great quality meats.  Ground beef was on special for $1.99 Per Pound.  What a great price!

Great job Echo and Rig!    I can't say enough great things about this place! The first word i think of when someone asks me about Echo and Rigg is \"fantastic\", the second word \"consistent\"! We've been going to this restaurant 1-2 times a month for the past couple of years.  Alli, the hostess, is so awesome, she pleasant with all the guests, quick to greet people as they walk in and always very welcoming!  Nick, the waiter that we always request, makes our experience the best! He is great at his job, he is so busy but makes us feel like we are the only table in the place.  He's so personable and quick to make excellent recommendations when we can't decide!  We desperately miss Xavier and Kevin, two of the maitre d's that have moved on the help open the restaurants new location in Sacramento, but Celine is proving to be an excellent addition to the Mgt team!   We have never had a bad meal here, the food is amazing, perfectly seasoned and delicious....and the price is great!  I def",

The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were huge and delicious, and the tomato watermelon salad was a perfect summer dish.   The crust on the ribeye cap was much too salty for my taste, however it was a very nice quality steak, and it could not have been cooked more perfectly. Once our server found out I did not prefer the seasoning, it was taken care of immediately, and we were also given a complimentary dessert!  I can't say enough how great this place is, from the great food to the slowed down industrial/chic ambiance to the amazing staff. Definitely worth the drive!",

I was told that it would be an hour wait. No problem. It was my fault for not making a reservation; I should have known better! Lol. But anyway I left my name and number with the hostess and went off to do some shopping around Tivoli Village. We were seated in a nice spot of the restaurant. It was a nice set up and there was a little bit of noise from all of the people there but it wasn't so loud to the point where I had to yell to hear my husband. I had looked on Yelp prior to my visit and hoped that I could try the black spaghetti but unfortunately it was not a dish they no longer served. I went for the grass fed lasanga and my husband had a nice cut of the rib eye. For an appetizer we had mussels. Everything was delicious with the perfect portions. We also got the seasonal sorbets. They give you 1 scoop of each flavor. I liked the pink grapefruit the best!  Celine was our server. She was detailed in explaining the menu to is and was a lovely person to talk to. When I come again, I will make a reservation and request if I can have her as my server.",

    "text": "My friends had picked this place, and I came along for the ride. To start, I am by no means a steak enthusiast, so I can't do a proper critique of a place that distinguishes and prides itself as a steakhouse/butchery. That would be the equivalent of a non-drinking designated driver hitting up the bar and reviewing a Shirley Temple, while all his/her friends got progressively drunk. This is why my star-rating is a little skewed.   I'll tell you what I did have though: PORTOBELLO FRIES with HERB AIOLI ($9.80). Believe the hype! They're incredible. Huge slices of mushrooms, crunchy on the outside perfected with a delicate balance of melt-in-your-mouth goodness on the inside. Worth it. I also had a side of Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes with White Cheddar ($5.90) and indulged in The Seascape cocktail ($9.80) -- Ketel vodka, fruity yet potent. My friends had ordered side dishes too, and we just did a family-style thing where we'd try each other's selections.   Service was great. We walked in on a Monday afternoon without reservations and were immediately seated upstairs. The interior was not too packed, but had to wait a little while before our waiter took our food order. Overall, an upscale and well-managed restaurant, but it's not really somewhere I'd frequently visit. Like I said, it would probably appeal more to the folks that take advantage of their meat menu.",

    "text": "An American steakhouse with international influences, and a menu that transitions with the seasons.  The small plates make excellent starters. They're not tiny, single serving portions, but these can be shared between two people.   Butcher's Choice Sausage: Chicken sausage was served with onions, a sweet tomato sauce, and slices of of jalapeno peppers for added heat. The combination of flavors was just perfection.   Bone Marrow Carne Asada: Fatty, melt-in-your-mouth, the amount of meat was generous when compared to other restaurants that basically just serve you the bone.    For my main entree, I ordered a Hanger Steak sandwich. This is perhaps one of the best steak sandwiches I've eaten. Prepared at medium rare, it was juicy and tender enough where I didn't have to tear into it animal style and look like a cavewoman in the process.   Dinner closed with a Chocolate Cherry Sundae. The ice cream isn't your grocery store variety; it was creamy, rich, and chocolaty. The pecan toffee cookies added crunch, and the brandied cherries were pleasant. A great way to finish off a marvelous dinner.   When it came down to service, our server Edward wasn't all talk and no game when he mentioned how he provides impeccable service. Not only was he professional and personable, he was knowledgeable about the restaurant, the food, and the history of the cuts of meat offered on the menu. Speaking of the menu, we were told that the menu items change to reflect what's in season.   The food isn't only delectable, but surprisingly fairly affordable for a steakhouse -- did I mention that they have their own butcher shop downstairs with a selection of meats on display? Plus, there's no pretense here whatsoever. Without a doubt will I be returning to Echo & Rig.",

I want to get the rib eye cap next time to get a different flavor. This place is off strip (5 to 6 miles west) but totally worth the drive as the prices are reasonable and you get a more laidback experience. The server was a little awkward, but he had great intentions. You think he was about to finish his sentence, then he just stops talking. Not sure if he was nervous, but his game was a little off.

We get to our table where we were seated outside and the ambience was everything! We were greeted by our waitress right away really friendly. We got the Bottomless Mimosas which were a treat because they poured the champagne into the glass for you and then you pour your own orange juice (most places do it for you and you have more OJ than champagne). I had the Steakhouse Scrambler and my friend had the Short Rib Hash. Both dishes were really tasty and we got our food fairly quickly!

I came at 12:30 today with a medium sized party and long story short with was well after 2 PM by the time I got my two eggs because that's the only gluten free breakfast item they have. Eggs. Do better, there are so many better restaurants in the area that offer even gluten free potatoes. In this day in age there really is no excuse not to have gluten free bread either.",

The chocolate cherry one is the most elegant option.  This is you best option for an elegant late night meal in the area.... beats the pants of Cheesecake Factory, that's for sure  Their service is amazing! Better service than at some of the fanciest restaurants on the strip, which will not be a surprise to some... haha Seriously perhaps the most attentive waiters ever.",

When we first got there the GM saw us waiting and he offered us drinks when we got up to our table the manager came over and welcomed us and another manager opened a bottle of wine for us. Something you never see is management being so involved and it shows on how wonderful their staff is.

I've never written a review but this was place was so amazing that I just had to! Everything from food to service was great. Here's how the whole experience went: I called in to make a reservation for me and my girlfriend's 4th year anniversary. They asked me if there was a special occasion and I told them it was for our anniversary. When we walked in and told them my name, the hostess congratulated us on our anniversary. When we were seated, our waiter, Lucas (Luke on the receipt), also congratulated us. As we wondered what dishes were good since it was our first time there, he seemed completely honest with us. We ordered the filet mignon, butterfish, portobello mushroom fries, and Brussels sprouts. I usually don't eat Brussels sprouts but the waiter suggested it and I don't regret it at all! A few seconds after we finished the complimentary bread, we were given another without having to ask. Same goes for when we were about half way done with our water. The service is incredibly quick. The waiter also suggested to order the white lightning cocktail and it was also great! All of the food was amazing. The filet and butterfish were tender and juicy. Portobello mushroom fries were delicious and you can't really get it anywhere else! After we finished eating the main courses, we wanted dessert. The waiter then informed us that we are going to receive dessert on the house for our anniversary! Ice cream with assorted nuts. Tasty! Walking out, we were stopped by the restaurant manager, Xavier, and given his business card and told to contact him anytime whenever I plan to go back. Everything was great and I definitely plan to go back!  The restroom was also really cool. Sea salt scrub as soap. Paper towels were thick and soft. Most interesting restroom I've been to..",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. I have been to Echo & Rig previously and have enjoyed spending my dinners there for special occasions. I've recommended friends and family to try the restaurant out due to it's normally good food and service. A few days ago was my son-in-law's graduation dinner and we decided to celebrate there per his request. We had a reservation for 9:30 PM. We arrived shortly after our reservation, around 9:35pm or so. After checking in, the hostess didn't really explain what was going on. Soon it became 10 pm and we still weren't seated. Why did we bother making a reservation then? When we first came in, they said they wouldn't seat the party until the whole party arrived. Our whole party arrived, and still nothing... Just continued to sit downstairs in the lobby. Then when I came back and check in to see what's the hold up, they said they're waiting for the people sitting at our table to stand up. Why are you giving me the run-around? Just tell me straight off the bat. The restaurant closes at 11 PM and still around 10:10 pm now we are not seated.  I know they're not going to shut down, but we have places to be and don't like to feel rushed and make employees stay after hours to accommodate. We were already starving because the only reservation time they had was 9:30pm. 10:10 pm and we still weren't even seated for dinner yet. The waiter we had was decent. Nothing special. Service was meh. However I didn't quite catch the name of the assistant waiter (he was darked skinned and was refilling our waters)... he did a great job and was very attentive and professional! The manager (?) I'm guessing on duty, came and apologized for the wait and offered fries for the kids but he did not seem sincere. He just seemed like he was doing it by force. He never did come by again to check on the table. I can't help but feel out of place here. I really did feel like I was treated unfairly because of the color of my skin. I really do feel like this place caters to \"white folk\" and if you don't fit within that, you get crappy treatment and service. Won't be coming back or recommending anyone here anymore...",

    "text": "I've dined at Echo & Rig 3 separate times. Twice was for brunch, which was amazing and loved sitting outside on the upstairs patio. The service was great and the waiter/waitress were so pleasant.   But yesterday, I decided to go to their Happy Hour. I had heard about the great specials, especially the $1.99 Steak & Eggs and Shrimp Cocktail.   While there were 2 bartenders, one of them seemed to be designated to getting the drinks for the waitstaff. While the other was strictly serving sitting at the bar. My boyfriend and I were 2 of maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. Not ONCE did the bartender ask me if I wanted another drink, while my empty glass sat there. And each time I tried to get his attention, he must have been in his own world and seemingly ignored me. He also carried on all his conversation with younger bus boy behind the bar with him, who hovered waiting to grab your empty plates/drinks before you were even done.  I do enjoy the food, but the service at the bar left me with mixed feelings. I think most people would agree who enjoy sitting at a bar over a table in the dining room, that a friendly attentive bartender can truly make your experience great.  I felt that I was a nuisance for having to ask for my drinks/food. I do hope they focus more on customer service at the bar.",

It was packed and we had to wait an hour but we had no problems since we sampled a dozen items while we were waiting including lamb sausage, bolognese, sirloin steak, pork sandwich, and much more.  With all the sampling they provide, I'd actually prefer to arrive at a busy time for the freebies.  NO CORKAGE fees and when the manager saw that we had our bottle in hand while we were waiting, she took it to go get it chilled and brought it out immediately when we were seated.    We ordered the Spencer Steak (specialized rib eye) and the Lamb chops which was some of the highest quality and best bang for the buck steaks you can get.  This was accompanied by portobello fries fried perfectly with a little crisp and all the fresh umami meatiness from the mushrooms.   The cauliflower you could practically feed to kids...so delicious.  We will definitely be back.   I stll dont know how this place makes any money but we'll continue to go back.  With the free wine corkage and ridiculously cheap prices, i dont know how you could ever go on the strip.   Echo and Rig is a must!",

As you walk in, you have a bar to the left (serves wonderful sangria) and the butcher to the right. Yes, they butcher their own meat!!! As you head upstairs to be seated, it's in an open space that feels like a comfortable setting.   I've had a couple of the different grass-fed cuts - hanger, Spencer - both delicious and cooked perfectly. I've also had a couple of the small plates: asparagus, mashed potatoes, and ESPECIALLY the bone marrow carne asada - Amazing.  I also learned after the fact that you can bring in your own wine... as many bottles as you want. I will definitely incorporate this into my meal next time.

Considering this is a butcher shop/restaurant, I didn't expect to find so much fat on the steaks, especially since they sliced the steak in the kitchen.  Ordered medium rare and steak came rare.  This is fine by me, but might be too bloody for others.  Minus 1-star for the fat and cooking temperature.  Portobello mushroom fries were good.  Next time, I want to try their thick cut bacon.  E&R gives out free sparkling or flat water to the customers.  Nice touch.  I'm glad I got to experience Sam Marvin's food before a huge hotel/restaurant takes him away.  This place is not convenient unless you have a car.  If I lived here, I would be here at least once a month.  Once this area gets fully developed, I expect even more crowds and a greater wait time.  We lucked out and got seated within fifteen minutes.",

Got the rib eye, portobello mushroom fries and egg with grilled tomato and the hot and bothered cocktail.   The rib eye was ok, really just ok, not fab which was not what I was expecting. The portobello fries where kinda awesome but way to salty, the tomato was ok. The fried egg was ok. The cocktail was supposed to be bourbon based but it was so mildly burbony it mostly tasted of the avave syrup. So ya that's it the whole meal was ok.  I'm pretty sure they have amazing food hiding in there somewhere but unfortunately I just got teased.   Would I go back and try again, u betcha.",

Everyone who works there seems to genuinely want you to have a great experience.  I had a couple of the \"small plates\" - the really good portobello fries and the risotto, which was excellent.  My husband ordered the lamb cigars (I think that's what they were called) and they were delicious, as was his meat dish.  We split a cappucino dessert and it was too big even for us to split, but it was like frozen tiramisu.  We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Bottom line: Amazing. Price is astounding. In a good way. This is in the heart of Summerlin, at Tivoli Village, and the prices that are listed are so unreasonably LOWER than what I expected. And the Quality? Speechless. Ambience? Not one square cm has been left to it's own. These guys know what their doing; they're passionate about the food, the place, EVERYTHING. They want you to have a good time, and they've gone through great lengths to do so. The staff are very good; they're educated on everything on the menu (they take actual tests before their allowed to work and go through rigorous screening processes) and are highly educated on the different meats and the best ways to have them. I challenge you to find a better restaurant in all of Vegas. Seriously. I don't know of one.  More: As I've been in Vegas for the past 4 years (Really??! That long already??), I rarely come across any restaurant on or off the strip that I get so excited about that I would race to tell people about. Rarely is there a place where the owners are so passionate about not only opening a business, but pouring out their hearts and soul to anyone who will listen about their concept and show you their thought process.   Actually, rarely do you see that anywhere these days. It seems that the only ones you find with said mentality could be found in food trucks. Maybe it's just my fondness for detail in the most minute areas, but I digress.  The restaurant is divided into three parts: a butchery, a lounge-type are complete with a butcher bar (think sushi bar, but for meats like prosciutto) and mixology bar, and then finally, the restaurant.   The butchery is amazing. You need a meat? Go there first. Prices are so reasonable and the meats are the some of the best quality you can find. The staff are very knowledgable and can give you advice on the best ways to treat and cook the meat.  You can see the cutting from the outside of the restaurant through large windows that reveal probably the largest walk-in fridge unit in Nevada. Also visible are different meats hanging just like in a butcher. Because that's what it is. Adds a super nice touch to the whole look and feel. The mixology bar is awesome. Bartenders are great and awesome, seating is comfortable, and the Butcher Bar is definitely something that is a MUST TRY. I won't ruin the surprise, but trust me, I'm taking the time to actually write this long review and say TRY IT. You'll think: \"Why isn't this already in existence???\"  The restaurant is upstairs with an open view of the kitchen. Let me say that the ability to have Kitchen side dining is awesome. To be able to see the magic happen is just as awesome as eating the wonderful and delicious food. Now when I went, it was a soft opening and there weren't menus yet, so I can't recall much about the names and what was in the food. Sorry, I was just more blown away by the actual food and place that I pretty much just forgot. Which I will chalk into the \"It's a good thing\" category. I wasn't concerned that when I go there again that I'll only want that item; I want to try them ALL.  So, do yourself a favor: Give this spot a chance, and find out why this is one amazing place.  Edit: By the way, if you eat at the restaurant and want awesome service, I highly recommend asking for a waitress named Courtney. Probably one of the best on staff.",

Seating was awesome for family, as the water fountain was a good distraction for the kids. We ordered a Ceaser (Which was amazing) that they split on two plates for us and the kids had mac and cheese and mash potatoes. I think it was out in a matter of 5-10 minutes. We then ordered the porterhouse (Was about 60 dollars), and two more sides. It was more then enough food. The total for everything came out to 120. Cant beat that. Everything was perfect and they treated me like a was a king. Thank you for your hospitality and we will be coming back!  Also we will be getting your catered Thanksgiving diner. Can't wait!",

    "text": "Located in an outdoor shopping complex off the busy Vegas Strip, Echo & Rig was a spectacular find. Parking is free and plentiful in any of the underground garages. Alternatively, there is valet at the door. I admit I found the first floor layout a bit odd - the hostess area to the left of the door, an oyster bar at the bottom of the stairs, a butchery to the right and a few scattered tables in the center. The hostesses were very pleasant, asking questions and jotting down notes as you walked up the staircase. This note was then passed on to your server as a conversation starter, which was a nice touch.  We opted to sit outside and the ambiance was perfect. The furniture was comfortable, the lighting and balcony overlooking the street made for a romantic evening. Our server, Ramon, was truly a professional and offered suggestions from cocktails to small plates to entrees. We opted to start with the Portabello Fries which were flavorful and nothing like we've ever had. Get it! We both opted for the Spencer Steak (him with the chimichurri and I with the bearnaise) and the Cauliflower and Pork Belly small plates. Unlike some places where your steak arrives alone, E&R's comes with garlic chips and a mushroom Rockefeller. Our small plates/sides were a good portion for parties of 3 or 4, especially since the steaks don't come naked. I found the steak cut a bit chewy side.  We ended the night with bursting bellies and declined dessert but the server brought over the caramel turtle sundae anyways and WE COULD NOT PUT THE SPOONS DOWN. It was so good!  Our experience was phenomenal and made for a memorable birthday dinner! Kudos to the top notch service. I would be here every week if I didn't live across the country.",

The portobello fries are everything that you've read about, but don't forget to get extra sauce.  The cauliflower side is uniquely prepared and delicious.  The Mac & Cheese was also pretty good, and the wine selection was plentiful.  Only misfire was that our original waiter, who seemed only slightly annoyed with our modest order (it was already 9:45!) dumped us off on another server and, while we've become accustomed to this from time to time in the industry, always there's an explanation prior to having a new server approach the table.  Still, highly recommend a visit.",

We live in OC, California and are in Vegas about 9 + times throughout the year for business and always make a stop at Echo & Rig! Last night we shared the Charred Octopus salad (my far one of my favorite dishes in this town), Portobello fries (amazing) and a Skirt Steak with Chimichuri (delish). Service is fabulous and always consistent!!",

Chef Chris is a magician with food, he's gotta be, insane, and Adam knows his meat. THE SERVICE!!! The best service I've had in years, we had 5 people tending to our one table. Every side, every cut of meat, every salad, every sundae, every drink PERFECT.  And honestly very reasonably priced for this level of an experience.    Nicely done guys, will absolutely return when I'm in Vegas.",

E&R is our go to spot for celebrations, taking friends and family or, just because! Since our first visit we have been greated warmly and now it's like we are part of the family!  The brunch menu is amazing, bottomless mimosas are a plus and it's always hard to decide what to pick (waffle, pancakes, thick cut bacon - delicious) The Peruvian style ceviche is a top favorite along with the tomato and watermelon salad.  Dinner we opt for steak and our go to sides of choice tend to be the broccolini, roasted squash and brussel sprouts. We recently had dinner with a friend who ordered the fried spinach salad, butter fish and heirloom carrots. All of which were so yummy! Really, you can't go wrong!  If you're in the mood for a burger - order it! We have branched out from our faves and were not disappointed!  Now, I'm hungry just thinking about it all. Guess we'll be paying E&R a visit this week!  (Side note: if you're looking to go at a busy time or holiday call ahead for a reservation they do get VERY busy)",

She was so attentive and had wonderful recommendations. I got the salmon Benedict which was falorful without being salty (as many places are), my mother got the Steakhouse scrambled which she said was the most delicious cut of meat she has had at a restaurant. All of the staff was attentive and the food was beyond excellent. This may be my new favorite brunch spot. We had several check ins  from the manager Beth, who made sure our experience was enjoyable.  I can't say enough good things about this place. If you're near Tivoli Village you must come here, hell even you're not. I traveled from Henderson, and it was well worth the drive.",

The portobello fries were really good, but very heavy, so perfect if you want to share amongst friends. The grilled octopus salad... Well let's just say I still dream about it. The octopus was grilled to perfection- was not chewy at all. My favorite dish had to be the carne asada bone marrow- however, I have had it twice and they varied greatly on portion size. Of course the steaks are what make you go and they don't disappoint. They are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. We had the Carmel turtle dessert which was also amazing... Just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore I was eating this dessert. All in all, one of my favorite places off the strip!",

The food was killer, I just had a simple steak salad for lunch on a business meeting and wow.  Stellar.   The patio upstairs outside overlooking Tivoli is sweet, prime location!   Food 5 star, service 5 star, with linens and very pro, decor, just right!   The bar downstairs looked very enticing as well.   I bet this place is packed on weekends, resos required, and bring a little cash, its reasonable but not spendy.   Get on this, its hot and tasty!",

    "text": "This could be my new favorite Vegas steakhouse.  We started off at the downstairs bar while waiting for our table.  I have to praise their liquor selection; they even had a couple bottles of Rip van Winkle bourbon, which I have been struggling to locate for a while now.    When it was time, we were walked upstairs to the dining area.  Our server, Justin, was able to remember not only our names, but the names of my friend's two dogs as well.  This place does not have a corkage fee, so I would recommend bringing your own wine.  We didn't do that this time, but the wine list was also very moderately priced (I usually google an establishment's wine on my smartphone to see what the markup is).  My party of four ordered a few small plates to start: Octopus, pork belly and grits, watermelon salad, apple and fennel, and charcuterie.  All of these dishes were exceptional, but my favorite was the pork belly and grits.  The fatty part was crispy on the outside, and melted in your mouth.  The meat was as tender, and the grits were on par with what you'd get from an authentic Cajun restaurant in New Orleans.    For our entree, Three of us split a 41 oz tomahawk ribeye steak, while the other member of our party got the black spaghetti.  I had a bite of the pasta, and it was nicely cooked, with a good chew.  It also came with a very generous assortment of seafood.  By the way, this dish was like 13 bucks -- what a steal.  The massive ribeye came out with a beautiful sear that made your mouth water.  A cross section of the steak revealed a perfect mid rare.  No unsightly grey band.  All in all, an excellent meal.  Excellent service, and much more affordable than a steakhouse on the strip.  5/5.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Found in Tivoli Village, Echo and Rig is a meat lover's dream.  Come here for the slabs of meat you can buy, stay for the delicious dishes they serve.  Echo and Rig will have your taste palates running wild like Hulkamania and your stomach bursting like the chestburster from Alien.    A few of us went on a Friday afternoon.  Our friend's wife's cousin was the Executive Chef at the place.  He wanted to stop by and say hi.  We all followed and thought it would be best we stuff our faces at this place.    From the outside, you can see the various meats hanging and placed around the freezer room.  It was a sight to see.  When we went inside, the butcher welcomed us with open arms.  Not only was he super friendly, but he was super handsome (just like me).  He kind of looked like James Purefoy (from the t.v. series Rome), but with more facial hair.  Man, I'm probably way off with the look.  Maybe he sort of had a Brad Pitt-esque facial structure.  Wait...why am I talking about him?  Let's talk about meat...no....not his meat, I'm talking about the restaurant meat!  So, James Purefoy (we'll just name the butcher that) led us into the freezer room and schooled us on the different types of meat on each animal, how you can combine each part to make something delicious, and told us some other fun facts.  Did you know Vikings used every single part of the animal?  Thanks for the info, James!  As we left the freezer room, he began to give us a little history lesson about Echo and Rig.  While he dropped some history on us he gave us some samples of headcheese and liver.  It was my first time having these delectable delights.  Actually, I can't say they were delectable before trying them.  The thought of headcheese and liver made me dry heave.  However, I summoned enough courage to try them out and it wasn't bad at all.  The liver tasted a little salty, but I was able to down it no problem.  The headcheese tasted just like ox tail.  After Mr. Purefoy entertained us, we were escorted to the upstairs patio area for lunch.  We were served by the most pleasant waitress I've ever come across.  Kind, gentle, sweet-- just like me on a first date.    My friend's cousin gave us appetizers on the house.  They were portobello fries and fried cauliflowers.  Man, hmm...hmm!  The sauces that accompanied these fine appetizers were also great.  I've had portobello fries before, but this takes the cake and smashes it in everyone else's face.  For lunch, I got the grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese had short rib, white cheddar and parmesan in it.  My first bite was ecstasy-- the gooey cheese was pure bliss and the short rib was nothing short of fantastic.  If I had 20 hands I'd give this sandwich 20 thumbs up.  And don't get me started on the chips that came with the sandwich.  The freakin' chips, man.  I need to wipe the tears from my face because I'm reminiscing about the good times I had with those chips.  I'll be sure to pour some liquor on the street because I do miss those chips.   Echo and Rig is the spot for great food and a euphoric atmosphere.  Check the place out because you won't be disappointed.  And I should point this out, just because Mr. Purefoy would want us to:  support your local butcher!!!!",

Both were properly cooked to order, and the meat was very good. Interesting sides and appetizer choices. Your choice of seven different sauces ( e.g. blue cheese, brandied mushroom, bearnaise, etc.) is served with the meat. Share-sized fresh raw steaks were brought to our table for display. Fresh bread and spreadable whipped butter were served before our meal. Very quick service with everything we could need. A good value, all things considered. The staff impressed us with service equal to (or dare I say, better than?) some of the finest establishments we've visited. Nice atmosphere, but a bit noisy. Kudos to the well-run machine and great food. We look forward to our return. Why not five stars? Her flank steak was a tad chewy (but extremely tasty); her tea sat dry twice waiting for a re-fill; it took a bit longer than we wanted to pay the check. Otherwise, a fantastic evening out.",

    "text": "I'm really torn here.  I know that the food here is fantastic and all my friends LOVED their meals.  I myself thought the grilled cheese was like candy and am still thinking about it days later.  But that's where it stops for me.  My experience is a classic example of how one server can ruin a meal simply by having a non \"customer first\" attitude.  I'm sorry to my server for not wanting onions and aioli on my burger.  I'm sorry that I asked about the home-made chips and wanted an undressed salad with a side of fries instead.  (The salad ended up coming dressed and I couldn't eat it, by the way).  I'm sorry that when we discussed the temperature of my meat, you were annoyed by me wanting to be clear that I wanted it pink/juicy, but not rare.  Sometimes when I say medium, it's under-cooked, so I like to try to explain that somewhere between medium and medium-well is perfect.  You insisted medium-well and quickly followed up with, \"ok, she can't order anymore.\"  My burger was indeed over-cooked and while you stayed and waited to make sure it was ok, I was done back at the ordering process, so I just said it was fine.  I couldn't handle anymore interaction.  We finished up and everyone enjoyed their meal except for me.  Thank GOD for the 1/6 of incredible short rib grilled cheese.    The take away here is this:  not every customer can just hand you the reigns and say bring me whatever.  Some people want things the way they want them and that doesn't make them any less of a person.  Maybe another time when I'm in Summerlin, I'll try again.",

    "text": "Steakhouses and Las Vegas are almost synonymous. it's a place for high rollers, a place for celebrations. The ritzy cocktails, bottles of wine, fancy suits and extravagant dresses. You'll find all of these in every steakhouse and casino. These days modern day concepts and celebrity chefs are all the rage. Gordon Ramsay Steak, Jean Georges, Stk, Mastros Ocean Club, the list goes on and on. It's an experience to enter one of these places to enjoy great cuts, fancy drinks, and hopefully fond memories at astronomical but fair prices one would argue. Good cuts should cost that much right? What if one were to wander away from the neon lights, pass the quiet Vegas suburbs and into a little village called Tivoli?    Service: Our server Ari alone was pretty much worth the five stars. Even with only an hour left in his shift he didn't slack or cut back at all. Instead of asking for drinks first which is what almost all servers do he asked about us. How our night was and wether we've visited before. \"what took you so long.\" He quipped and I couldn't agree more at the end of the night. he went into a brief history of Echo & Rig, described the popular items, why they were popular, how they tasted, how they were made with every detail. He was selling the food in a way that I wanted to just order everything he mentioned. He was honest and genuine about it and it wasn't just someone reciting the specials. After some time of looking and processing the menu he came back with a full platter of Meats. New York, Ribeyes, Tomahawks, all in full wholesome glory. Ari went into full detail of the cuts described on the menu drawing out each imaginary cut on the steaks and describing the sauces used if any, cooking process, marbling, and flavor profile. Everything you needed to know. I like my steak rare and I wanted to order the New York Wagyu. Ari seemed concerned and quickly told me the reasoning as to why it wouldn't have been as good. (Due to the low cooking not being able to melt the fat and release the True flavors) He recommended another cut and refused to let me settle for medium rare. He could have just sold me a more expensive steak but instead he sold me a cheaper one just to match my preference and to allow me to truly enjoy optimal flavoring. Absolutely phenomenal.   Food: I love the concept of Family Style being Asian an all. It's even more interesting to see the concept brought to a steakhouse. The starters were all shareable, delicious, and well portioned. And don't worry the steaks are not small, and they also come with a side of Chips and Mushroom. The best part is of course the price. Any one of these dishes would have been 15 or more on the strip but here it was 8-10 for starters. Steaks on the Strip $50 or more on a small cut. Here, $28 gets you an amazing cut with sides. Absolute steal, Good Prices and Amazing food is probably one of the many great joys in life.  Starters:  Bone Marrow Carne Asada: A giant Bone Marrow with Carne Asada as a garnish as well as four pieces of bread on the side. With recommendations from Ari we squeezed the orange slice all over the Bone Marrow and Carne. Although I don't have much experience eating Bone Marrow this one was great. The bone marrow melted in my mouth, Carne was juicy and flavorful, and the orange citrus gave it a refreshing tang. 10/10 would recommend  Portobello Fries x Herb Aioli: They taste like giant fries, and it's not overly greasy but full of crunch and flavor. Then it tastes like perfectly cooked portebello mushroom. The Herb Aioli was also amazing. Not a big sauce person but I found myself and my girlfriend dunking everything in the Aioli.   Mac x Cheese: Made with 7 different cheeses and very rich. It was delicious but we wish we didn't get this as it was just too much when it came out with our steaks and found ourselves barely picking at it.   Entrees:   The Spencer Cut: We both got this cut and we were both extremely satisfied. It's basically a giant Filet. The temperature was just right on both of ours, rare was cold in the middle and medium rare was hot but not too hot. The outside was perfectly seared with just the right amount of seasoning and not too crunchy or salty. You can tell a good steak just by cutting into it and it was like cutting butter. And like butter the steak melted in your mouth unleashing great flavors. The Garlic Chips were delicious and fun to snack on while the mushroom rockeffellers made the perfect compliment. We also got a choice of sauce, I got Bernaise and my girlfriend Lemon Chimichurri. The Bernaise was hearty and comforting while the Chimichurri a little exotic in flavor.   Thoughts: Was close to going on the strip for a good steak but I'm glad I remembered passing by this place a couple days prior and giving a local place a chance. I've found myself doing that alot recently and I\"m constantly pleased. Sometimes It's good to not be blinded by the glitz and glamour and stray off the beaten path, you never know what awaits.",

    "text": "Hello,     Our review for this restaurant is one star for a lot of reasons, here is our story. We had reservations for ten, 3 kids and one infant. The hostess initially had sat us outside without asking on a cold and windy day. This was not right for multiple reasons. They do have heat lamps but on a windy day they are less effective especially when its cold. We eventually get seated inside and the waiter comes over and takes our order for drinks and states he will be right back. This is where the frustration begins to add up. We waited for around 15 minutes, he arrives and states oh your drinks are'nt here yet let me go grab your drinks and i will be right back. He comes back with the drinks and takes our order. My wife ordered a bloody mary that tasted nothing like what they should taste like so she decided to return the drink. We keep looking around and waiting for our waiter and he was no where to be found. By the time the server came back we had finished our drinks, we were ready for a second round and the wife could return her bloody mary. The food came out and a plate was missing. They said it will be right out but took a bit and now you have one person eating while the others are finished. On top of this i ordered the grilled cheese with no meat and the sandwich was'nt even remotely warm, it was cold. I usually never write reviews but when the service is poor it deserves a review. I hope this restaurant makes some adjustments to improve the level of service.",

    "text": "I don't think that you can get a better off-the-Strip steak in Vegas than at Echo & Rig. This place was PHENOMENAL! I can't overstate how amazing the meal was. My boyfriend's the steak expert and chose this place because of the in-house butcher shop, and it didn't disappoint.   We stuck to their normal menu, although they did have a few special cuts for that night. Both of us got a steak and we split three of their sides. I had the bavette steak, which they recommended to be done medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and melted in your mouth. They're not small steaks but not overwhelmingly large. For the sides, we went with their baked brie, their bone marrow, and their mashed potatoes. All three were amazing and good sizes, and the mashed potatoes might even have been too large of a portion.   The ambiance is very upscale and intimate without being pretentious. Our servers were both completely sweet and incredibly helpful, and the general manager even came around to make sure everything was alright.   Between the two of us, with appetizers, drinks, steak, and dessert, the bill wasn't even $150 after tip. I'd consider that a steal for the quality of food and atmosphere. We will be back!",

    "text": "- \"Reservations\":       Made reservation a week out and came on time for reservation only to be told \"There's 7 or 8 parties ahead of you\". Had to wait 20 minutes past reservation time.  - Atmosphere/ambience:      I felt like I was eating in a mess hall. There was close to no decor in the big open room and it was very drafty. We were seated so close to the table behind us that I elbowed them several times accidentally.  Nothing even close to resembling a romantic or comfortable setting.   - Food:       We waited two hours from our reservation time until we received our food.  Many wife's \"well done\" steak was medium.  Our friend's medium was raw.  My steak was cold and they never asked how I wanted it cooked.       Our sides were cold and had to be replaced. Awesome.       The bread was bland and nothing special.  - Service:      AWFUL.  The \"manager\" came and had to take our drink order 20 minutes after being seated because we were ignored.  Our drinks were often empty and the food took at least an hour from the time we ordered it to actually receive it cold.      The waiter was Gone most of the service and the manager was extremely condescending and disingenuous.  He had no clue what he was doing and had no right being. A manager.      I was so fed up with the crappy everything that we sent our steaks back and snacked on our cold sides. They offered us two bowls of ice cream in a cereal bowl as a \"kind offering\" for their complete lack of culinary ability and people skills. When they brought out the ice cream, they stated something along the lines of \"Don't be mad at this too! This is supposed to be cold.\"  - Price       What a rip off. I would have had a better meal and experience if I ate a bag of frozen White Castle cheeseburgers off the ground of a public restroom.  After taking two steaks off our bill it was almost $150-$200 after all was said and done.  Luckily we were with our favorite people with us....this subsided some of the pain.   - Summary   I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. It just wouldn't be right to send them to this place. I can't name one thing they did right during our experience. Not one. TERRIBLE.",

Happy hour menu includes: Steak & Eggs for $1.99, Shrimp for $1.99 and Hot Dog for $1.    What isn't advertised is that the happy hour menu isn't offered until 4:00p on weekends or that the menu items are fixed and may not be cooked to order.  We went on a Saturday and were told the kitchen staff is \"switching \"over\" and can not be ready for orders until 4:00p. Steak and eggs: about 2 oz of undercooked, very salty steak and 1, over easy egg.  My eggs were extremely runny. Shrimp:  mound of small, fishy tasting shrimp slathered in cocktail sauce on a bed of greens. The hot dog was the best deal: Hebrew International served with sauerkraut for $1.    While waiting for 4:00p we couldn't help but notice flies in the bar area and the staff touching our garnishes with their bare hands. But hey, hot dog and beer for about $5.  Not bad, just not impressive.",

    "text": "I've been drooling over the menu for quite some time- there's literally nothing on it I would not eat, all a matter of pacing to eventually get through all of it. The meats are obviously the highlight, but the rest of the dishes are done fairly well too. I especially appreciate the small plates setup, as that's how I prefer to order my meals.  BONE MARROW CARNE ASADA: Can we have a moment of silence for this dish? It was a spectacular start to our evening, my only wish is for more. Loved the slight char to the crostini, the marinated red onions added the perfect acidity to cut through the fat. CAULIFLOWER, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions: such a great combination of flavors, but the toppings don't really stick to the cauliflower making it a bit difficult to actually enjoy the dish as intended. Advise cooking the cauliflower a bit softer. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon: I love sprouts but didn't care for them in this dish, BF enjoyed them though. Seemed under seasoned to me. Texas Slow-Smoked BRISKET, white grits & braised greens: thick-cut, smoked to deliciousness, brisket with a delightful barbecue sauce and some really great parmesan and garlic grits. Really enjoyed the kale and onions. Would order again!  CARAMEL TURTLE sundae: salted caramel ice cream topped with peanut brittle pieces, bourbon sauce, bittersweet chocolate chunks, and whipped cream. An upscale take on a classic chocolate-and-caramel ice cream treat, beyond indulgent to begin with and also an enormous portion. Loved the texture that the brittle added.  Service was on point, starting with an introduction by the owner and continuing with Luke throughout the evening. Sat on the heated balcony with a great view of the Tivoli Village fountain and the full moon in the sky, classy and romantic ambiance.  Will be back to try more of the menu and update accordingly.",

    "text": "Tried to walk in after 8:00 on a Friday and remarkably they were able to accommodate after about 30 mins. When they found out it was our first time there the manager came by our table and welcomed us and was sincere and very congenial. Luke was our waiter and directed us to their Portobello fries and herb aioli appetizer with basil sauce. Very good. We ordered the Spencer steak and the ribeye, and  the prior had by far the best taste. Must've been an off night because the ribeye just wasn't there, taste or texture-wise. It was either real tough or I had a dull knife. Probably won't try it again but will definitely come back to the restaurant. The garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini were abundant and were delicious. We had told the maitre d' it was our anniversary and at the end of the meal Luke brought by some ice cream with caramel and toffee brittle. It was a very nice touch. Later the manager came by again left us her personal card and told us to talk to her if we come back again, which we definitely will. We waited a while for our food but it was busy and Friday night. The staff, the atmosphere and everything but the ribeye was great. I would sincerely recommend.",

The waiters insist on trying to read the entire menu to you which is very annoying. The Short Rib Hash, a featured item was served cool. The meat was flavorless and the item was 98 % potato. My wife had an egg white omelet which was extremely under cooked. She sent it back and it returned less cooked than the first time.   This was a horrible dining experience.

The interior of the restaurant is very grand, but we opted to be seated on the upper balcony area because it was a bit chilly inside.  Despite the warmth outside, we were seated beneath a fan/water mist thingy, so we were very comfortable.  I can't remember what everyone had at this point, but I remember thinking that despite the rave reviews on Yelp, the food we had was okay, not great.  But I will say that the service was impeccable and the restaurant offers a very nice environment in which to have an upscale (not stuffy) dinner.",

All were cooked medium rare and were perfectly charred. The inside was more on the rare side and very good. They cut the steaks for us so that it was easy to share.   The sides were awesome as well. The Brussels were amazing with a slightly tangy flavor. The greens added the perfect contrast to the meat. The cauliflower was lightly crispy and really tasty. The peppers that they had gave it a nice kick. The portobello fries were a great change to your typical fries.  Really crispy and the sauce it came with was perfect.   Overall we had an excellent dining experience and would recommend this place to anyone wanting a good cut of meat with outstanding sides at reasonable prices.",

I've been to some great steakhouses from around the world Whiskey Bar in Malaysia to Hawaii's Hay's steak house to Florida's famous Berns...now I really have to say hands down the best steakhouse I've been too! I've been in the restaurant industry for 15 plus years and I'm lost for words of this place. The service was great the food was fabulous! I've been to steak houses and almost each one has cooked my steak wrong or get it confused except a couple while in the middle of the rush of the restaurant, and the is one of them. Ari's service and personality is great and made the night memorable. The prices are not as bad I thought it would be like how the strip in Las Vegas is.  We went and there's always someone that touches something they're not suppose to like a guess touching the AC so they messed it up and the coils got frozen and had a hard time keeping the room cool it's ok because they had fans going to help with the heat. My steak cook to the perfect medium rare. They actually let the meat rest before serving it! I highly recommend going here!",

We ordered a couple of drinks, and appetizers. Shortly few minutes later we head over to the table..and they were nice to transfer the food upstairs.. This restaurant has a nice layout. The bar is located downstairs while the restaurant and open kitchen is located upstairs. The ambiance was casual but not really cozy or romantic and it was loud maybe because it was housefull.  The menu  offers an arrange of what sounds such delicious items, such as seafood, steaks, salads, small plates etc    We ordered bone marrow, roasted brocollini, horse radish butterfish and pork belly spicy slaw, grilled cheese sandwich and  Lamb cigars. Bone marrow was filled with onion and no bone marrow on one of the piece and the  waitress was nice enough to trade it with Grilled octopus.   The rest of the food were incredible.   The fish was cooked perfectly, well seasoned with horseradish crusted and full of flavor. One of the best fish I have had in Vegas. The grilled cheese with short ribbed were incredible. All of our sides were awesome, the pork belly was meaty and the dipping sauce they are served with was to die for.  My favorite sundae was the cappuccino sundae.  Our server was Lauren.She was top notch. The rest of the staff were all wonderful too. We did not have any issue with food delays, water refills or anything. I'll be recommending this place to my friends and family.",

    "text": "Tonight we went there to celebrate our son's visit from New York. We had bragged about it so much because our first visit was so pleasurable. We told our son it is far better than Peter Luger in NY. Well, it was total disappointment :( We got the family style Tomahawk Steak as we did last time that is sold by tgeOz so we ended up paying $95 for a 37 Oz steak that was all blackened FAT! Hardly any juice and was not delicious at all!!! The sides were OK. We had the Bone marrow carne Asada, cauliflower and Potato Gnocchi. Desert was pretty good. The wine was Ok too. All and all the steak was a total disappointment.  This is an update on this review! The restaurant management took the time to respond and invite us back to give it another chance last night which happened to be my Birthday too. We had a wonderful time. The Ribeye was done perfectly and was delicious. We had great cocktails and a reasonably priced good Chilean wine. They treated us to some delicious appetizers and sides. The service was awesome. For last night I give a 5 star. Had a wonderful evening. Thank you Echo & Rig",

All the way through we encountered perfect and attentive service - the staff knowing we were celebrating our 5th year anniversary.   We went partially with Yelpers recommendations and partially with our server Lauren's recommendations. The portabello fries went amazing with the herb sauce and the marrow carne asada was creamy, fatty and garnished with lime - all the flavors just went perfectly. Hubby got the rib eye steak and it was made to perfection, medium rare just the way he liked. I got the wagyu cut medium and despite it being marbled, I still thought it could have been more tender. All in all, great price point for the steaks we got.   They were amazing enough to give us a complimentary dessert to celebrate...Lauren recommended the in-house cappuccino ice cream, and she was spot on. This dessert blew our expectations out of the water...we were stuffed by then but couldn't stop eating it. The coffee flavor was great, and paired so well with the bread that came with it. Thank you so much Echo & Rig for making our 5th wedding anniversary dinner so memorable!",

    "text": "My Hubs and I had our anniversary not too long ago, and we wanted to go out to a nice (but not too expensive) dinner together to celebrate. I had been to E&R for brunch, but John had never been, so he made us a reservation.  We were excited that they greeted us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" when we arrived. You enter on a lower level, where there is a long bar as well as the butcher shop with a large display case of available meats for sale. The restaurant itself is up a short flight of stairs (there is an elevator as well). It's a large, open dining room and there is also a large patio overlooking the shops below.   As I had been there before, I was familiar with the menu. But that didn't stop my hubby and I from drooling over the choices and basically deciding what we wanted well before our reservation. We started the meal with a bottle of Pinot Noir - Echo and Rig has a great wine list with many reasonably priced selections and different varietals, ranging from $40 to $99/bottle. They also offer wines by the glass and a decent selection of beers on draft, including 2 local beers (would be nice if they offered more local beers, but 2 is a good start). I believe they also allow you to bring in your own bottle of wine, but I am unsure of their fee for corkage.  I had been raving about the Portobello fries and insisted we order these as an appetizer. They are really amazing and come with an herb aioli on the side, which complements the fries perfectly. At $9.80, you get a large portion and we unfortunately didn't eat them all (we wanted to save room for the rest of the meal). My guy loves salads, so I knew one of our courses would be greens and he made a fantastic choice, ordering the vegetable chopped salad (also $9.80). This salad was unlike any other I've ever had - it was loaded with veggies! It featured hearts of palm, carrots, blue lake beans, corn, avocado, tomato, snow peas, summer squash, green onions, pecans, Pecorino and creamy cilantro dressing. Holy freshness!! What an amazing summer salad. It was a perfect segue into our main courses.   It's a steakhouse, so you better believe we ordered steaks! However, they do offer seafood and sandwiches if you aren't in the mood for red meat. We both ordered the same cut of meat - The Spencer Steak ($28.60). All of their steaks are cooked over red oak and are served with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. They also offer you one choice of their sauces, which include bleu cheese, red wine demi, brandied mushroom, bernaise, charred onion, horseradish cream and lemon chimichurri. I love horseradish, but decided to get the bernaise sauce when my husband ordered the horseradish cream. We both agreed his sauce was the better of the two and our server brought us out some extra, since I was eating all of his. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and were really juicy and delicious. The garlic chips were a wonderful accompaniment to the meal, along with the mushroom Rockefeller. Although we ordered from the menu, I do want to mention that they do also offer cuts from their butcher shop. Your server will bring out a silver platter with some of the most glorious cuts of meat you will ever see! These cuts are priced by the pound and I thought the prices were very competitive (meaning they aren't gouging you). There were Tomahawk ribeyes of different sizes and we both talked about how that would be the way to go with a group of 4 people, as long as everyone could decide on the cut of beef. These steaks are cooked to your liking, then sliced and served family style at the table.  All of the sides are a la carte and great for sharing. We went with the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar ($6.40) and the brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon. I am not normally a big fan of brussels sprouts, but will always try them and have found 1 restaurant in town where I absolutely love them. While I would probably not order these again, they were tasty and a large portion for $8.60.   Although we were totally stuffed, our server mentioned that they would like to offer us complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Who can say no to free dessert?! Definitely not us. So we shared their cappuccino sundae, which is made with sponge cake cubes, chocolate shavings, affogato fudge sauce, and topped with espresso ice cream. It was sinful, rich and delicious. We really appreciated them recognizing our special event and surprising us with this kind gesture.    This is a fantastic local steakhouse and we are looking forward to going back again soon! The service is knowledgeable and friendly and you'll definitely feel like you are at a much fancier/expensive restaurant. If you haven't been - GO! You can't go wrong, whether it's for brunch or dinner.",

I came here to celebrate a special event and the place is absolutely pristine.  Nice decor,  and open atmosphere.  Let's start off with the food -  the steak is absolutely terrific,  very nicely seasoned cooked on a woodfire grill.  We ordered the rib eye and the special.  For sides we ordered the mash and the cauliflower,  which definitely was one of the highlights that our server suggested.  The level of service rivals restaurants with Michelin stars,  thanks to Hugo and the manager, Kevin.  Unfortunately,  I made the mistake of trying out their scallop crudo side dish,  which was not so fresh.  I know,  some might say... a steak house... why order anything other than steak.  Point taken.  One bite and it was just so fishy,  even after all the citrus and lemon on the crudo.  I let the manager know and they were more than happy to take it off the bill,  but alas today I sit typing this review with a bad case of food poisoning,  a dozen or so visits to the bathroom this morning.    I plan on visiting in the future and hope to have a repeat minus the food poisoning!  Come for the steak,  be weary of the crudo.",

Tivoli Village is already nice location, but the atmosphere inside of the restaurant fits right in. It's classy, but you feel comfortable dressing casual. It has just enough tables to be cozy, but still feed a good sized crowd. Our group share a bunch of sides and small plates, as well as our own entrees. The Lamb Cigars(basically egg rolls), and Potato Gnocchi were both very good! I ordered the Spencer Steak with sides of Roasted Broccolini and Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The steak was great with the Brandied Mushroom sauce, and the sides were also very good. The service all the way around was excellent. Our server, Lauran was awesome! She friendly, professional, and just great! She always made sure we were ok, without hovering. I'm sure I'll be back again, and will probably ask for Lauran's table. I would like to try sitting on the balcony when the weather is nice. I'm glad I live close by!",

I was looking at all the photos and decided to go here due to their patio seating.  Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us and asked how many and I said \"a table for two\". Then she asked if we had a reservation and I said \" no\". They had a waiting area so we sat and waited for our table to be prepared.  Another couple right behind us had the same interaction as us (table for 2 - no reservation) and waited at the waiting area as well. Clearly we were there first, but we definitely got treated different after the fact.  The hostess went straight to the other couple asking if they wanted inside seating or patio seating. They never asked us what kind of seating we wanted.  Then after waiting a few minutes, they were sat first before us. Obviously i was wondering why we were not sat first, but didnt want to cause a scene and just decided to wait.  After the couple left, we were called over. The hostess once again did not ask where we wanted to sit so they sat us inside but this is when my husband had to say something. He politely said  \" we actually wanted to be outside\" So once again we waited and the hostess said she had to ask her manager about it.   I have no idea why we were served the way we were. Everything else besides getting seated was great. - food was excellent, server was great. Due to the seating - not getting accommodated as much as the other party of two was frustrating.",

They weren't kidding.     As you enter Echo and Rig you'll notice that it's not only a restaurant but also a butcher shop.  There are some amazing cuts of meat displayed beautifully at the front. Not gives you a great preview of what you'll have to eat.    We sat down and the waiter offered us drinks and a menu.  One of my friends who's been here often said don't even look at the menu. He'd order the appetizers but we'd pick our meat from what they bring to show us.   The waiter then brought out a tray just loaded with tomahawk steaks and ribeye.  We ordered one of each. My friend also ordered some French fried portobello mushrooms and some garlic mashed potatoes.    When the tomahawks and ribeye came out they were just a delight to look at in the plate.  Cooked perfectly and sliced gorgeously displaying the perfect  cooked outside and red to pink middle.  The taste of the steaks matched the look!   Incredibly delicious steak!   A perfect last meal of my vacation!     I've also recommended all my friends visiting Vegas to stop by this restaurant.  Make sure to try to portobello mushrooms too!  The juices that come out of the fried goodness will make you want to double your order!",

Mushroom fries are divine, as is their smoking thick cut bacon.   When we go for brunch we usually order one of two things, the burger or the blueberry pancakes. The burger is juicy, with a flavorful heirloom tomato and the smoked cheddar is a must. The bun always seems fresh. The pancakes and just a hint of lemon. I think they execute this better than most.  Bottomless mimosas for $20 is great but they also have a thoughtful beer list and delicious cocktails.  Cappuccinos are ok, wish they had milk alternative though.",

Once at our table, we were greeted by our waiter, Sam and the manager. Ordered 3 steaks and several sides (brochollini, mac & cheese, frys and the bacon app). Sam was a bit miffed that we didn't order the $50-70 steaks that he brought over to show us rather than $30 steaks from the menu.  Overheard the table next to us complain about their food being served cold. Sam was their waiter too.  The food was VERY good and we ate ever crumb. Definately get the bacon appetizer.  Overall, I would go back and hope to not get Sam. We asked for separate checks and again he seemed annoyed at us and then he got them wrong.",

There was only one downside to the experience.  We loved the food. The atmosphere was nice. We were able to use Open Table. Everthing was a winner except for Sam, our waiter. For whatever reason Sam thought little of us. Any question I asked was met with a condescending answer. I don't understand the mentality. Sam is a waiter. While I don't think I'm any better than Sam I also don't think Sam is any better than me. Clearly he did think so. I asked about a side and was informed snidely that marjoram is a spice. I didn't ask about marjoram. I asked how the corn was served (on the cob or removed). My lamb chops came with violet mustard. I tasted it and found it to be delicious so I asked how it was prepared. All he would say is it's VIOLET mustard - three times he said it. I told him I tasted wine and was curious (we like to replicate things at home). He left and came back a little later, telling me dismissively that it was a red wine and mustard reduction. Was that so hard?  On the other hand his assistant, Julian, was a breath of fresh air. He was young and seemed happy if we were happy. I was so impressed with his attention to detail and his genuine courtesy that I stopped the manager and told her I thought he did a wonderful job.  So I guess I recommend the place with the caveat that you should avoid Sam.",

It is always an overpriced small piece of meat and some sides that I can easily buy at Costco for a fraction of the price.   BUT, I love Echo & Rig! It is an atypical steakhouse with excellent customer service. The prices are great for the high quality all natural meat that they give you. The best part is that you don't have to have steak, there have tons of other options too.   Yesterday night I went there for dinner to celebrate a birthday, and everyone was happy with their food. Edward Salame was our waiter and he gave us 5 star service. He was knowledgeable and very charismatic.   I got the Trenne Pasta dish, which was tasty. I love their Over the Rainbow Quinoa Salad, chopped steak salad, mussel, and octopus.",

I highly suggest the Jumping Beef - it's a braised dish in some amazing Peruvian broth that is jumping off.  I felt bad for leaving that broth sitting left behind.  Husband ordered the center piece of a prime rib.  He's a big red meat eater & even though the selection & presentation of the meat was unmatched my most, this steak did not do it for him.  Wasn't anything special & somewhat grainy.   The garlic mashed with cheddar we ordered on the side was room temp - hence we didn't eat much of it.  He ordered oyster sampler to start but the waiter forgot so it wasn't served.  Wound up being ok with that since he was full without it.  Now with the awesome stuff - the service was impeccable.  The greeting at the hostess station was welcoming.  Nothing was left sitting on our table. We were never left unattended.  The wait staff was fantastic.  The manager came over to introduce himself & make sure we were ok.  They used our name several times & I heard them doing it at tables around us which is highly uncommon.  The location of the restaurant for us is perfect.  The dining area is beautiful & is located on 2nd level with large windows to look out over Tivoli Village.  I think they right now are the cats meow in Summerlin.  They've got everything.   Next time we'll sit at the bar downstairs.",

I should have said something but we were having a hard time catching our waitress and it was just so busy in there.

    "text": "We started with portobello fries were covered in a light and flaky batter. The mushrooms were savory, but not overpowering, dipped in herb aioli sauce. Even the herb aioli sauce created a myriad of sweet and any that truly brought out the essence of the portobellos.  We also opted to try the calamari. Deliciously tender, and in no way chewy or tough. Served with red marinara sauce, as well as the herb aioli sauce. Unbelievable!!! I haven't had calamari so tender in years, BRAVO! Fantastic Steak. We had the Spencer, AMAZING. I had the red wine demi sauce medium rare, while my boyfriend had his medium with the brandied  mushroom sauce. The red wine demi had a light but rich flavor, that played well with the rare portions of my steak. The texture is creamy without being too rich, and it simply melts in your mouth.  My daughter had the asparagus with a fried egg... sooooo not just asparagus and a fried egg. The asparagus had a lightly smoked flavor topped with the perfect slices of aged cheese. She also ordered penne bolognese. Honestly, this was the closest sauce I have ever had at a restaurant, that tastes as close as my Italian grandmother's sauce (AKA gravy). Saving room for ice cream was tough, but we did it! Worth every bite the cappuccino and caramel turtle sweet, but not so rich that the ice cream weighs you down. Our waiter was Jordan and we were instantly impressed with this young man's knowledge and descriptive purpose for each dish. Not once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled. Thank you Jordan for treating us with great service and consideration. Although, my boyfriend and I are well off financially we did not walk in dressed well at all. Echo & Rig is definitely about the food and not the prestige of who walks in their door. They are fair and consistent with how they treat their customers. We came in looking as casual as you can be, which subjectively for us, is  T-shirts & shorts. We will be back.  As far as the prices....beautiful! For those of you that don't think twice on dropping $25-30 on all you can eat sushi...try these guys out first!",

House made chartcuterie and great steaks, so I was excited to finally eat there,  and all I can say is why did I wait so long! We skipped the apps and went right for what we came for...steak. My wife and I ordered three cuts, since we wanted to try a variety and could take home the leftovers: skirt, hanger and flat iron. All excellent and perfectly cooked.   Few restauarants have even one of these cuts, usually sticking with the standards: ribeye, New York and filet. If you have not tried one of these \"butcher cuts\", so called because the butcher would take them home, I encourage you to do so. They are the most flavorful of the animal. The portobello fries, garlic mash and roasted brocolini were all terrific as well. Finished with a couple of the sundaes and a perfect machiato. As good as the food was, the service was even better. And the bonus, no corkage.",

Avacado toast with a side of shishito peppers is a great treat as well.   Apple pie for dessert served more like a sundae was delicious.  We come here about 2 times a month.",

I could not have been more pleased with her pleasantry, service and table reservation for an evening that I did not even have to mention was an extra special occasion for my girlfriend and I.  Furthermore, we were fortunate to get Nicholas G. as our waiter.  From Nicholas' introduction to receipt of the check following desert, I could not have been more pleased with his service, personality and recommendations regarding the menu.  From start to finish, from the Oysters to the Bavette American Kobe Steak...to the desert that did not last more than minutes on the plate, team members such as Beth and Nicholas have only made us want to visit Echo & Rig in the very near future. The 5 stars is an understatement when I recall our experience",

    "text": "OMG, this is the place to go in Vegas! Looked at this restaurant prior to our trip and thought it was okay. Got to Vegas last day here and wanted something special for dinner. Wanted beef (STEAK!) and wifey saw Echo and Rig. Pictures don't do it justice. Made reservations for 7:30. Wife, daughter and I arrived at 7:15 at Tivoli village, nice place. Went right to the restaurant. Open the door meat shop and bar downstairs cool. Hostesses greeted us with smiles and enthusiasm. One of the girl addressed my wife and we had a jovial conversation. We went upstairs nice decor. Wifey asked if we could be seated outside. They accommodated, very nice view. They asked us if this was our first time there and we said yes.  Within 5 minutes the manager Beth came to our table an introduced herself and offered sparking and distilled water and also took our drink order. Very friendly. Within minutes we got our drinks. Beth brought over our waiter who immediately introduced himself and reviewed the entire menu. Very nice touch. I asked him about the Bavette and Spencer and he gave me a thorough breakdown. Bavette had a porterhouse flavor and Spencer was similar to a ribeye. We placed our order, wife and daughter ordered skirt steaks and I ordered the Bavette medium rare.  Waiter explained that they cook the steaks more on the rarer side which is perfect. Also ordered sides Caesar salad, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The waiter recommended we get an appetizer which we did, calamari. I don't think we ordered enough. Within 10 minutes bread, Cesar salad and calamari arrived. Salad was fresh not heavy on the dressing,anchovies were fresh. Portion was big enough for two. Calamari was crisp and fresh, it came with two sauces cocktail and basil aioli. Basil aioli was delicious. Steaks and sides arrived within 10 minute. Plates nicely decorated. Steak came with chips and a stuffed mushroom and the sauce of your choice. To be honest the steaks didn't need it. We cut into our steaks and we're impressed. Nice beefy flavor, juicy and cooked to perfection. Broccolini was tender but not over cooked. Mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful.  My wife and daughter did not finish their meal.  Of course I cleaned my plate. The waiter staff checked on us periodically. The busboy packed our leftovers for us. The waiter came back and gave us our dessert menu, good selection. He recommended several desserts but we had our minds set on the sorbets. Got the peach and blackberry flavor. Wife had to be different and ordered a after dinner drink, Remy. Dessert arrived in a bowl nicely decorated with strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and blueberries. Sorbet was cold fruity and flavorful. Berries were ripe and sweet. Very refreshing. We ended our meal and Beth came over to give us her card and told us to call her whenever we are in town and she would have a table for us. She also told us to bring our own wine because there is no corkage fee. What?Restaurants make their money from alcohol. Nice touch!   The waiter brought us our check and told us it was a pleasure to serve us.  This place couldn't get any better unless they gave us a lifetime of free meals.  Overall great waiter, staff and service. Good food and great ambience and reasonably price.   Beth we will be back again!",

    "text": "After many visits for brunch and lunch, we decided to take an out of town guest to dinner at Echo & Rig.  We have always been very pleased with their service and quality of food, however we were extremely disappointed in the service we received that evening.  The manager greeted us shortly after we arrived and welcomed us in.  After about 20 minutes he returned to take our drink order as he stated our waiter was busy taking the order of a large party.  It took a long time for our drinks to arrive.  Finally a waiter (not ours) came over and discussed the menu and took our appetizer order.  He returned after some time and asked if we were ready to order our meals having forgotten completely that we'd ordered an appetizer some time ago.  He apologized and put the order in immediately comping it for us.   We ordered a second round of drinks from our original waiter who we had not spoken with as yet.  The drinks were not correct when delivered and had to be put in again.  We waited quite a while for our meals.  The waiter said that the kitchen was backed up and they would be out shortly.  When our meals arrived we did enjoy excellent steaks cooked as we had ordered.  We called the manager over to express our concern over the service and he explained that the staff works together, but to us it felt as though our table was an after thought with no one really taking care of us.  The manager sent us dessert gratis to express his concern.  While the food here is exquisite, I am not sure I'd return during the busy dinner service.",

If you don't order the cauliflower small plate you're doing something wrong with your life (unless you're allergic or something). I could have eaten 3 servings of that dang sweet and spicy wonderflower all by myself.   As an entree, I got the over the rainbow salad, and the boyfriend got the summertime steak house. I was delighted by the array of gorgeous flavor in my salad, and the boyfriend was not disappointed with the flavors in his steak salad. However, portions for the salads aren't too large, resulting in a boyfriend who was still pretty hungry.   Went to the luxurious bathroom and they had salt scrub! Never have I been to a restaurant with salt scrub, so, of course I indulged in the exfoliation.  I will definitely come back to this restaurant. Great place!",

My husband and I went late-ish on a Saturday night, the hostess was lovely and the GM promptly came over to welcome us in (as I'm sure he does with every table, however it didn't seem like a generic welcome with fake enthusiasm, he was very polite and professional). The food was excellent! I'll say it again, the food was EXCELLENT! First courses were delicious, nothing was over done or 'too much' and dishes had their own unique twist that worked really well. The steaks were super good, cooked perfectly, not done up with extras, and really good sauce (on the side, because really, the steaks were so good by themselves). The wine list was very approachable, unique but not pretentious and the wine service was great. Our server Lauren was the best! Very friendly, knowledgeable, and the perfect balance of attentive without being overbearing. She was a huge part in making our experience so stellar. Great food can be ruined a bad service experience and vice versa, but Echo and Rig was one of the best overall dining experiences we have had. Thanks to everyone who made it such a great evening!",

The main course - a tomahawk steak (bone in ribeye) - was enough for a party of four, ordered medium rare, and done perfectly. Had the caramel turtle sundae for dessert, also exceptional. Couldn't have been happier with our experience.  One thing they could do better: keep the wine list up to date. We ordered a 2008 Beronia, and Sam brought a 2010 bottle. Older wines generally cost more, so bringing a newer vintage at the same price without mentioning it - not right.",

Beautiful, and the smell of the food just taunts you (in the best kind of way). Server was great at the beginning, and the manager was touching tables and checking in with guests. Deciding on something was so difficult- there were so many things that sounded absolutely tantalizing. My SO ordered a burger and I tried the avocado toast, having never tried it outside of my own kitchen.  Avocado toast was beautiful, and featured sliced avocado with some oil drizzled on top and some seasoning; however, in tasting it, I (sadly) preferred my own avocado toast at home. The additions of the oil and seasoning added nothing to me, except nuisance. That \"drizzle\" of oil I mentioned ended up on the plate, the table, me, basically everywhere.  My SO's burger was beautiful also, but he had thought his burger was okay. Nothing to write home about.  Service was great, until we had our napkins on the table and were ready to leave. We finally just flagged someone down to get the check as we got tired of waiting.  All in all I wouldn't recommend for brunch, but I'm willing to give it another shot for dinner.",

We were referred by a friend to try this restaurant and we are so happy we did. Came with a party of 8 and all of us felt the same, 5 stars across the board. The steaks, sides, appetizers and salads were all delicious. All at a very great price. We are customers for life!!",

    "text": "Came here with some friends to enjoy a reasonable priced steak dinner. If you tired of the strip scene, check out Echo & Rig. It's near Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Located in the west side of Vegas in Tivoli, Echo & Rig serves dry-aged beef. We tried the Porterhouse and Tomahawk Ribeye along with a crispy cauliflower side, arugula salad, and portobello fries. We ordered the steaks medium-rare. Our server brought out the uncooked meats to us and we chose our selections. Steaks were served pre-cut, so you'll need to eat fast otherwise the meat will get cold quite fast. I particularly liked the New York side of the Porterhouse. Tender, meaty, and plenty of umami flavor from each bite. They cook the steaks over red oak, so you can taste the smoky flavor. Don't get me wrong, the Tomahawk Ribeye was good too. Fatty, tender, and meaty best describes the ribeye. My least favorite, albeit very good, was the filet side of the Porterhouse. It was a bit too soft and a tad gamy.   My favorite side was the crispy cauliflower. It's a must order. Slightly dusted with chili and subtle seasoning from the onions made this side well worth it. More than what I was expecting from a cauliflower dish. The portobello fries and arugula salad were standard fare.   Service was prompt and courteous. We sat outside and the breeze was nice on a June evening day in LV. Sip that gin or whiskey, and you'll be glad to have visited this steakhouse.",

    "text": "We ended the year with a delicious bang! My beau made dinner reservations to dine here for 2014 New Year's Eve. The entire reservation process was effortless. However, their phone line can get busy and you may reach an answering machine - if this happens, I would suggest trying again a little bit later. The restaurant/ butcher shop is Chef owned and proudly advertises farm to table style dining. Not to mention, it's the same owner of the wildly popular Bottega Louie in Los Angeles. Talk about a tasty resume.  When we arrived, even with reservations, we encountered a minor wait. They have a cold oyster bar right in the front area and they treated us to a taste of the freshest and sweetest oysters with mignonette and also offered us some champagne - a supremely classy touch, especially on a night like NYE. They were extremely gracious and offered us many apologies for our wait.  We were then escorted upstairs into the main dining room - it was a packed house! The crowd was a good looking bunch. The dining area had an elegant atmosphere with clean, minimal decor. The less art on the walls makes for more more art on our plates. Smart.  We were offered flat or sparking water and also some bread and butter. The bread was room temperature and didn't have any special touch. I wasn't too upset since I wanted to save room for a great big meal ahead.  Let's get to the good stuff: the food!  Pork belly and white grits $9.80 - I hope you're taking notes on this one. Whatever you do, add this to your list of items to try! The pork belly was cooked with insane expertise, super buttery, and the grits were ultra sultry. My date took one bite and said \"now this is what grits is supposed to taste like.\" I nodded fervently in agreement. The creaminess and flavor of the dish was phenomenal. I'm rating this as one of the best dishes I've tasted in 2014! That's an accomplishment. Flavor rating: 5/5  Fried Spinach Salad with red onion, cauliflower broccoli & chili-lime vinaigrette $9.30 - Super delicious! I loved the charred flavor and crispy fried texture of the spinach. The dressing was sweet and slightly tangy and it really enhanced the flavor of the earthy spinach. Flavor rating: 5/5  Roasted garlic mash $5.90 - This dish didn't do it for us.  I mean as simple of a dish as mashed potatoes, how do you mess it up? It was super dense and dry, not to mention... where's the roasted garlic? It was super faint and I didn't taste it. Flavor rating: 2/5  Cauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy caramelized and sweet shallots & onions $5.90 - YES! Yes! yes! so much yes!!! Luckily I left dry-town since this dish took my tastebuds on a magical ride into flavor city! The roasted cauliflower was cooked well plus I was not expecting so many pops of delicious flavor from the caramelized shallots, every bite was screaming with excitement, especially when you get a little bite of the chile de arbol. Wow! Those little guys pack some explosive heat and amazing flavor. I was shocked by the heat level on those pretty little chilies. I enjoyed the overall thought of this dish. Who would have thought cauliflower was that exciting? Kept me wanting more. Flavor rating 5/5  Wild mushroom soup with a touch of cream $5.90 - I wasn't a fan and it's unfortunate since I am a wild mushroom soup lover. It was boring and watery. A thicker consistency and an extra boost in flavor would have been nice. Flavor rating 2/5  Ribeye cap $29.10 - Served with a mushroom Rockefeller (greasy, but not bad) and house potato chips (greasy and boring) You also have a selection of sauces you can chose to pair with your steak - we couldn't decide between bleu cheese or bearnaise sauce, so our generous server brought us both! We appreciated that gesture. The steak was cooked medium rare as we requested, but somehow we were both not blown away by the seasoning and flavor of the steak. It's sad for me to have to say this, but I've had better steak. I really wanted to love the concept of them being a butcher shop restaurant, yet I just was not a fan of my steak; It was lacking juiciness and flavor. Even the sauces were tried were rather weak. We both preferred the beanaise over the blue cheese but it's not something I would ever order again. Flavor rating: 3/5  I'm not going to lie - I thought it was troubling that we weren't blown away by the steak, but it wasn't terrible. To me, it was average; to someone else, they may be really blown away. I mean, c'mon, my taste buds have a mind of their own sometimes.   Overall, the pro's outweighed the con's during our dining experience. I feel that the disappointments with our dishes boil down to our own personal preferences. We enjoyed our server and the maitre'd was also a charming young fellow that really took his time to mix it up literally and figuratively at our table! I just feel so bad that they had to work New Year's Eve all throughout the countdown as well.  My respect goes to them for their hard work and great service! Happy New Year!",

    "text": "Went here for dinner the other night and I have to say I wasn't that impressed. The noise level was insane so you could barely hear the person next to you speaking so that was annoying.  I ordered a medium rare filet and what I received was rare, no medium anywhere to be seen but rare. I had to send it back to be cooked a bit more which for a steakhouse they should know rare from medium rare. Medium rare steaks should be cooked to where 50% of it is a red center, the steak they served me was almost blue rare and very difficult to chew. So with the fact that you can't hold a conversation with the person sitting next to you without yelling and they can't cook a steak, I wouldn't be back again.   The other sides that we ordered were just ok, nothing that I haven't had better anywhere else. I expected a fabulous dinner and experience but I couldn't wait to leave. The avocado toast with shishito peppers was probably the best thing that we had there.  I enjoy a good steak but this place is a bit overhyped.",

He gave us a variety which included prosciutto, speck, Genoa salami and brisket. And it only came to $37. By the time we got home and ate it we still had half left that we can eat tomorrow.

The steaks & eggs were really, really super salty!! People with high blood pressure would have to take extra medication simply because they can't request for less salt!!

Pro tip: make sure you get the Portobello fries you will not be disappointed! Also their price for bottomless mimosa beats every price in town for a measly $16 bucks as opposed to the going rate of $20 . My favorite thing about the bottomless mimosa is that the champagne come in a glass separately with a brandy soaked cherry at the bottom of the glass and the oj comes on the side. This allows you to regulate your champagne to oj ratio.  This is one of the very few places where you can get amazing food AND service at the same time!",

    "text": "fantastic fantastic fantastic.  I can not say that enough.  I have been to Echo and Rig a handful of times and every time I think it gets better and better.  I remember the first time I went there was a few hiccups and the temp of steaks were waaaaaay off.  While cooking in a fine dining steakhouse for more then 3+ years of my career I really laughed at that and it was pretty bad. but i understand growing pains.  Fast forward two years later I come back with some wonderful friends and bam, they are on point this time.  Each steak cooked to perfection.  Service was five stars, management was awesome, and everything that was served to use was on point.  I still crave that porter house my friend and I chose.  AND THE SAUCES OH MY THE SAUCES. My last visit was spectacular.  I can to wait to come back.",

They don't have a kids section on the menu but our server was very quick to tell us that there was a menu for kids with many options. Even brought her some crayons and a huge paper to draw on. My daughter got the chicken tenders with fries (as usual). We were served bread and butter which I expected to be warm and wasn't but was still delicious. We ordered the Avacado toast which was crunchy anddelicious. Perfect to start a meal. I ordered the Over the Rainbow salad and added chicken to it with the Champaign Vinaigrette. It was so fresh , churchy and light. Now my new favorite salad. My boyfriend ordered the steak. Now this is the reason I didn't give them 5 stars. The steak was ordered medium rare and was served medium well. My boyfriend is huge on steak so it ruined his experience. We were short on time for the visit so we just let our server know  when she asked how our meal had been. She was so nice about it. She apologized for the mess up and made it right at the end. Because of how great everything else was and because of our server Nans amazing service we will definitely be back for a second try.",

The waitress was attentive and knowledgeable (Beth, I believe, was her name), and the steaks/small plates were perfection.  We started with the tomato, watermelon, onion salad at the waitress's suggestion. It sounded strange, but the flavors paired so well together and was not in the least bit too filling to enjoy the rest of the meal. Ours included the garlic mash and the corn & marjoram. Both were great. My steak choice was the Bavette, which had a lot of marbling and flavor. It is up there with one of the best steaks I've ever had. My girlfriend chose the Filet Mignon that was also cooked to perfection, although I preferred mine over hers.   Our waitress and the rest of the staff kept up with just the right ratio of attentiveness and leaving us alone to enjoy the meal. Even though it was a cold and borderline rainy evening, we sat on the heated patio and it couldn't have been a more pleasant dining experience.  This is my new favorite steakhouse, hands down.",

I have been to echo & rig multiple times for their dinner service, but I recently visited for that meal between breakfast and lunch that all the \"fancy adults\" seem to enjoy so much. I figured it was about time that I try it out myself... and I was not disappointed!  We sat out on the patio around 10am, which was totally okay for the first hour because of the fans they have out there to help with the Vegas heat. Bottomless mimosas run about $18, while a single mimosa is $8. You are also provided with the option of OJ, grapefruit juice or white cranberry juice. I opted for grapefruit juice and of course tried out everyone else's for comparison- grapefruit juice won by far in my book! I also really enjoyed their cappuccinos! Perfection for a coffee lover like me.  We also enjoyed some yummy avocado toast and bacon to start. I highly recommend both.  My main dish was the short rib hash. SO GOOD, but I certainly could have split it with someone else because it was very heavy. And as though we hadn't had enough... we also opted for dessert. The menu provided the same options as dinner time. My favorite is still the berry short cake with ice cream!  Service during brunch seemed a little more hasty than it is at dinner as they wanted to make the most of space and time it seemed. But overall no big complaints. If there's anything I learned that day, it's that I need more brunch in my life!",

I got the Farmers Market Breakfast ($13) and honestly thought it was okay -- a little too healthy for my mood that morning lol. For dessert, our table got the Berry Shortcake and the Caramel Turtle -- both very yummy!   Although I didn't enjoy my entree as much, I did see and taste the other dishes my friends got, so I would definitely come back here for brunch and get something else.

And we also love being ULTRA comfy & casual (shorts & slippers, Braddah!), especially when dining last minute on a quickie (less than 24 hours) RT drive to Vegas...that's why I'm glad to have found Echo & Rig.  Saturday night before Mother's Day, late (9p-ish), no reservations, we walk in in shorts & slippers (& yes we felt somewhat under-dressed compared to other patrons but we were too tired and hungry to care). After a 5 minute wait we were seated upstairs outside on the patio - it was perfect.    Based on the reviews & possible limited availability, I just had to try the rib-eye cap steak (smaller than I expected but so flavorful & juicy - it was truly the perfect size as I finished it off!), and we shared the Mac n cheese, the baked sweet potato, and the creamy mashed potatoes (yes, we LOVE our carbs - don't judge!!) - all were deliciously tasty and comparable to those at other fine steak houses.  Hubs ordered the short rib grilled cheese - it was bursting with cheese and generous with the flavorful short ribs & he enjoyed it.  Although we were stuffed and had our sides packed, our server convinced us to try to Caramel Turtle desert (it didn't take much convincing since we love our sweets too!) - it did not disappoint! We enjoyed every. last. bite.  Our servers and service were great, the Manager stopped to check on us, they kept our glasses filled, everything including the bathrooms were clean, and the bill wasn't bad either - I'm absolutely lovin Echo & Rig - we will definitely be back again!",

Food was quick and inexpensive with large side dishes. My only gripe was I wish they served the bread warm. But I can deal with it for the great service and delicious food. I will definitely return and recommend.",

We ordered many of the small plates..potato gnocchi with mint pesto pea sauce was delicious..brie in sourdough very good..pork belly burnt-ends to die for..and if you've never had chicken \"oysters\", try these because the maple jalapeno glaze is superb. We also had the short rib grilled cheese sandwich..my stomach is still smiling! He had a toffee, chocolate sundae(?) for dessert, and as full as we were, that too was polished off the plate. Beautiful atmosphere, attentive service, and some of the best food around!!! I suggest the outside seating in cooler weather, but inside is just fine..try it, you'll like it!",

    "text": "My new favorite off strip local steak place!  Unfortunately I can only give a limited review after only one visit.  There are a large variety of starter dishes served like tapas ranging from $5 to $10.  I ordered the bacon, pork belly and octopus.  All good but the pork belly over grits was amazing.  The menu lists a variety of non traditioinal steak house cuts such as tri-tip, hanger, flat iron, skirt, etc all at very affordable prices $20-$30.  I was excited to try one of these thinking how wonderful it would be to find a cheaper cut that is well prepared.  Then they tricked me by bringing by a tray of special cuts.  The tomahawk chop was a giant 45 ounce rib-eye with perfect marbling.  I caved and ordered this to share.  This steak was almost 3 inches thick after grilling which is a challenge to cook if you want anything rarer than med-rare.  It was done perfectly and seasoned very lightly.  Meat taste and quality was very good. I appricate the light seasoning as the quality of meat should stand on it's own...add your favorite sauces after the fact. My only slight complaint is that the chips and stuff mushroom side that comes with every steak was rather unimpressive next to the rest of the food.  So in the end, food was great and I'm not done sampling from their awesome menu. I spent way more than I could have but I was able to make steak and eggs the next 2 days and my dog was happy there was a bone left over as well.  Oh...other details, party of 2. Walked in on a Friday night at 6pm. 10 min wait.  Great service. Casual to dressy environment. Not the quietest place for romantic dinner.  It's a steak place...everyone was happily consuming drinks and beef!",

Atmosphere was classy without being pretentious.  It was busy but not overcrowded.  All of that was great but the real show stopper was the food!  I had the Spencer steak with a side of the Black Tuscan Kale.  I'm generally picky about my steaks.  I want them to be flavorful and tender but I hate big chunks of fat.  This steak was PERFECT!  It was juicy, tender and delicious (no easy task considering I ordered it well done).  It came with a stuffed mushroom on the side that was very tasty and some chips that were done just right.  My side of kale was very good as well although I was too full to eat much of it.  Overall it was a great meal and I can't wait to go back.",

My husband and I agreed that we would try this place again this time in the bar for happy hour! Already from the start it was five stars for price and quality of the happy hour items and drink! $1.99 steak and egg and shrimp cocktail & $1 hot dog.  For ladies, we enjoy the drink of the day for free- today it was tequila sunrise! We decided to try a few other things on the menu we were adventurous and tried the sweetbread nugget.  This didn't sound appetizing when the bartender explained what it was- but once in your mouth it was absolutely divine! Next we tried the bone marrow carne asada- bone marrow was good, tasty, fatty, with carne asada and onions on top with three toasts.  I would have preferred to have more carne asada. Finally we tried all the happy hour items and you can't go wrong with those prices! All were delicious! Our server in the bar was awesome too! He made the experience even better and that's why I gave the full 5 stars! We will be back!",

I also witnessed a waiter cursing at other staff members.  A little inappropriate with costumers all around and finally, im not trying to nit pick but i had sparkling water and my wife had still.  Without asking a helping waiter poured still water into my half full glass.  My wife and I will certainly return but hope we can have that flawless night that others have mentioned before us previously.",

After they finally brought over some bread, they forgot the butter/oil & vinegar.  By the time they came back with the butter we then needed more bread.

Unfortunately the service beyond getting sat was the main issue throughout the meal.  The server would leave the table for extended periods of time and we had to flag him down  for beverage orders.  Were told they ran out of Bread... so no bread service.  Clearing for each course took a long time.    The entree arrived and they forgot our cheddar mashed potatoes!  Then told by the waiter it was the food runners fault for not communicating to us they were out of that as well..?  The server seemed kinda rushed to leave for the evening and it was apparent during service.  He did buy us a glass of wine that he said repeatedly he paid for by himself for the inconvenience...unfortunately it wasn't the wine that i ordered....  The manager touched the 3 tables except ours in the restaurant.  Mgmt Feedback:  Always attack issues with the tables and deal with the problem head on.  Don't avoid addressing issues in the dining room.  The 3 Stars goes to the hostess and the food at echo and rig which is OUTSTANDING!

She gave us one of the most detailed rundowns of the menu I have ever had. She was very knowledgeable about every dish we asked her about. It was very hot out that day, and being from a cooler climate, we opted to sit on the patio. So she had other servers come check on us through out the meal. When we went back a couple of days later she came out to talk to us again. Also, their managers and other staff are very friendly and attentive. Any server that came would bring more water or ice if needed, as opposed to a lot of other restaurants where only your server will do anything for your table.   As for their food it was also great. We had the portobello fries- they weren't greasy and had nice flavour. We had the flat iron, grilled cheese, and roasted chicken sandwich. I would recommend all of them. Portion sizes are perfect. You can choose a side salad or chips as a side for the sandwiches. Prices are very reasonable for what you get!   The bathrooms are quite nice. At the sink they have a scrub that has some oil in it (I think) so it is very moisturizing. It's sold in their store downstairs and is quite pricey, but might be worth it since it smells great and seems to work well.  It's one of the few restaurants where there are so many good options that it's hard to decide what to order. I can't wait to return!",

They have an awesome happy hour from 4-6 and the bar was crowded. But at 6 it cleared out. We had dinner at the bar and enjoyed the USC game.  The food  absolutely amazing. I had the ribeye and I can't remember what my husbands cut was called. The steaks came with a stuffed mushroom and house chips. Both were amazing!!! The steak also comes with your choice of sauce and they were amazing too!!! We also ordered mashed potatoes and mac& cheese. The potatoes were to die for and you can't go wrong with the Mac and cheese. We ate it all and loved every bite. We could have done without the extra sides and been full but the sides were amazing! It was a treat so we went all out!!!!   It's also in a beautiful location. Away from the strip where you can still get free parking and we didn't have to walk through a casino to get there.  Can't wait to go back!!!!",

We did the bottomless mimosas and never managed to get to the bottom because they were so on it. And the staff was amazing. So genuinely happy and on their game.

He ended up taking our order and gave us a tiny wine tasting so we could figure out what bottle we wanted.  After a good 20 minutes our server finally came by. I think he was the only server on the patio cause he was backed up beyond belief, even other tables were complaining. The guy that ended up taking care of us, Alpheus (coolest name ever, like a Greek god) was outstanding. Some if the best customer service we've ever had. Even the hostess Arianna was great (which is always an awesome surprise haha)   Food was outstanding! We had; Lamb Cigars- tzatziki sauce was refreshing and very light Pork Belly- fell apart in your mouth, full flavor Thick Cut Bacon with homemade BBQ- HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Cauliflower- light appetizer but bursting with spice! Brussel Sprouts with Pistachios- light and subtle flavor with alittle crunch Skirt Steak- Carmelized with brown sugar, very juicy and full flavor Bavette Steak- popular European steak, similar to a rib cap cut. Not as tender as a rib cap but full of flavor  Wash everything down with a bottle of Malbec! Yum!!",

    "text": "I've eaten at Echo & Rig a couple times and it is pretty good, but I'd say overrated.  That said, Ive been going to the butcher shop for about a year to get bone broth and am consistently frustrated by the service. If they weren't the only place I could get the stuff I would've stopped going a long time ago. Most of the guys are usually extremely nice (hence the 3 stars), which is wonderful, but they have no sense of urgency and are painfully slow in completing every task. Every time I go there I call ahead and ask them to set aside my items, so I should be able to run and run out. I'm not there for a leisurely brunch, it is a simple errand I generally run while out trying to get to other appointments or errands. However, I inevitably end up waiting for 10-20 minutes for them to even get to me, even though there are very few customers at the butcher shop and always at least 2 employees.  I went recently and the butcher was helping another customer. I watched while the butcher pulled some items out of the cooler at a glacial pace, carefully cut individual pieces of paper, lined the paper up on the counter, laid the meat neatly in the paper, wrapped the meat with the precision of an origami master, taped the package, tied it with a string, found a marker, and wrote on the package. Then he started on the second package, which involved some kind of bacon resembling meat and he has to brush individual piece which some tool, then trim each piece, before stacking it in a basket weave pattern in the butcher paper. If anyone has seen Love Actually I felt like I was watching the scene where Mr. Bean is gift wrapping the necklace - just get on with it already! Then the butcher asked the customer what else he needed and the customer named about 6 more things and I knew Id probably be able to sit down for meal before I could get my broth I called ahead for that was just sitting in a jar in the cooler.   I was eventually able to catch the butcher's attention, told him what I needed, and asked him to just grab my broth when he went into the cooler for the next items. I showed him I had my money (exact change) ready, told him I didn't even need a bag or to be cashed out. He responded \"well I guess they (the other customers) probably won't mind\". Yeah, I'm sure they won't since it literally will not take one minute longer for you to just grab my stuff I called ahead for.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that if someone else is there first I have to wait. But you could at least move with a sense of urgency and act like you care that someone is waiting. Additionally, I do appreciate that they're offering something different than your grocery store butcher and I appreciate the care they put into what they do. However, if the service they provide is going to take 10+ minutes to help every customer, they should balance that with something else that would allow them to accommodate customers who can be helped in just a few minutes. The least they could do is have another employee (like the other kid behind the butcher counter) check in with me and see if he could help me. I know he may not be equipped to handle all orders, but he could've retrieved by jars of broth and cashed me out.",

    "text": "I carelessly throw around the \"L-word\" & this review will not be spared its usage.   Echo & Rig was recommended by a family member who clearly knows great food & with confidance, I can now also vouch for E&R's deliciousness.   I love love love that there are over 30 \"small plates\" on the menu. Grazing is my eating style, & if i weren't hell-bent on having filet, I would've ordered more than the superb portobello mushroom fries & herb aioli. Tried a bite from his stack of thick-cut bacon w/ BBQ sauce -- smokey, fatty, more like baked ham than bacon.   Love love that you get a (free!) sauce with your steak. His \"charred onion\" paired beautifully with his rib-eye cap, & my horseradish cream pick elevated an already lovely filet. Say yes to their garlic mashed potatoes.   And finally, love that our service issue was immediately & professionally addressed. My filet arrived medium after we'd waited 40-minutes for our steaks. They whisked it away with sincere apologies, & the filet was returned well done as I had ordered. Desserts & coffee (as if we could eat anymore!) were comped for our troubles (carmel turtle sundae is a must.)   Room for improvement: though I love (lust) that they pour ketel one, my cocktail, A Love Affair, delivered zero buzz, & tasted like a weak lemonade.   Provided they don't make a habit of making customers endure excessive wait times for their steaks, E&R's extensive menu deserves a second look the next time we're in charming Tivoli Village.",

    "text": "Mixed bag. Appetizers mostly wonderful, entrees inconsistent. Came here with locals who are both familiar and affectionate toward E. & R. and even they were underwhelmed and disappointed with our dinner.  It's a comfortable place, to be sure. Inside is a bit more sedate, but still has a pulse. Outdoors, on the 2d Floor patio, is refreshing and luxurious - and also considerably louder with the music pumping. Our server was a pro: He offered guidance and encouraged ordering all at once to avoid interruptions to us. I can appreciate how that can help the flow for the kitchen and everyone, really, but it seem slightly disingenuous. Our party was catching up and a few beats behind that sort of pace: we needed a moment. The only other thing that felt a bit awkward is how much the appetizers were over-ordered. The irony is, I think the appetizers were the most interesting dishes we were served. I just think we had twice what we needed.  The portobello fries are wonderful. I wasn't crazy about the accompanying sauce, Herb Aioli, mostly because it didn't improve an already clear winner. We had several pair of oysters, too, and those were lovely and fresh. We also got the fried calamari which looked good, if almost too typical for a place that seems to thrive on invention. (Sorry, but I skipped it) There was a spicy cauliflower dish (Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions) that I liked, not too spicy. I believe the sauteed jalapeno peppers came with the avocado toast, but don't quote me. We had an eruption of apps, and I did my best to keep it all straight. (I loved the jalapenos, by the way). The avocado toast -- not so much. I tasted mostly lemon and left it alone after one bite. There may have been one other appetizer (with octopus?), but I didn't try it. With so many apps (some double ordered), I was pretty much thinking that we got a tremendous amount of appetizers - with little regard for entrees, let alone dessert.  I love a great steakhouse, and I think that's what's going on here - but, honestly, maybe it was an off night. A New York Strip Steak didn't taste right and was sent back. I had the lamb chops  (Colorado Lamb Porterhouse Chops, Peewee potatoes, dried apricots & violet mustard) which is not the typical cut I'm familiar with. The chops were seasoned very nicely, I thought they were just OK. The meat was tough, at times. And my requested medium-rare came out mooing (or rather baa-ing) at super rare.  We did have some positives in the Entree department. The butterfish (Horseradish Crusted Butterfish Roasted, root vegetables & tarragon pinot sauce) was received very warmly; it remains a big hit. The grass-fed cheeseburger also got high marks. Fries are extra (and at first they did forget the fries). Otherwise, the burger comes standard with what seem to be homemade potato chips: good, simple, not too greasy. The one meat entree that got high marks at our table was the Jumping Beef (Filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes & Peruvian demi-glace). The Peruvian demi-glace does have a kick, but that will only make you enjoy each bite more slowly.   Some memorable sides and veggie plates include: Black Tuscan Kale (we boxed the remainder and made a tasty scramble the next day); The Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & White Cheddar is another well-seasoned winner.   I passed on dessert, but those who partook in the berry shortcake liked it a lot..  A nice surprise about Echo & Rig is that the corkage fee here is zero.   So, there's obviously a lot going on here. Some of the food we had was great; some of it really wasn't. I'm not so sure our local hosts are as eager to return, but there you go. And again, it may have been an off-night for Echo & Rig. We had our challenges just sitting still, ourselves, so I'm sure that didn't help, either. However, I would like to try them again. They have Brunch; they have a nice looking bar with tasting sounding cocktails. It's a lovely looking place with generally excellent service. (Music on the patio got turned up too loud at one point, but they were unable to turn it down.)",

I just wish the serving was bigger because I would have tore the whole thing up! We also tried the Portobello Fries & Her Aioli. ADDICTING AS HELL! Some of us ended up ordering more.   For dinner I suggested to the hubby to try the Rib-Eye (seeing how it was Yelps favorite), and I ordered the Hanger. The Hanger was good but honey's Rib Eye? OMG! I was mad at myself that I didn't order it! It was so moist and mouth watering good! We shared the delicious Mac and cheese, baked sweet potato and corn. Just when we thought we didn't order enough, we thought wrong. Good was so delicious and well worth every penny. Staff and service was top notch and on it!! So on it , we were laughing because every time I took a drink of my water, they were right there to top it off. I don't think my glass ever got half way lol   We'll definitely be coming back again with family and friends.",

He showed us all the cuts. We ordered 2- 38oz tomahawk steaks, Mac and cheese, 2 portobello fries, 2 fried calamari, and 2 Maryland crab cakes. All the food was amazing!! On another note, they have a life changing sugar scrub in the bathroom. If anyone knows what brand it is- please let me know lol!",

    "text": "A steak house with old world charm and it's far from the strip, I'm there.   Yes, it's about a 30 minute drive to get here from your hotel, but it is definitely worth the time. Trust me.   First off, the location is like a small European city. Nice shops and restaurants. A good place to explore.   The service was great from Shane. Omar refilled our drinks like a ninja (awesome guy) and Nick the manager was constantly checking on us. In other words, we were taken cared of.   The food FANTASTIC!! Here's the rundown: Oysters - we got 3 types. All were good, but the Washington (smaller oysters) were the best. The condiments (vinegar, hot sauce & cocktail sauce) elevated those oyster. Yum!  Caesar Salad - this is what a Caesar salad should be. Wow! My wife and I were splitting everything and they halved the dish and served it on 2 plates. Did I mention great service.   Grilled Octopus - DELICIOUS!! First off the Octopus was grilled to perfection. Smoky grill taste and super tender. The celery top worked well with the vinaigrette dressing. The beans and olives were sublime. A perfect dish. Get this one.   Ribeye Cap - the menu said it's the best part of the ribeye. You know what, they are right. I prefer medium rare, but Shane (our waiter) recommended to cook it \"medium\" take his advice. The steak was perfect. Tender and had that smoky aroma & taste. One of the best steak I've had.  Since we were sharing, they pre cut the steak into perfect serving sizes. Yes!! It's only 8 ounces, but it was just right IMO.   Price was very reasonable. Specially for the steak. When the steak is cheaper than the oyster, (and the steak was great) it's a great value in my book.   Parking was not an issue, it's plentiful. If it's your first time, watch for those big number signs they have. Look at the address (Echo & Rig is 440) look for that number and park in that area so you're close to the location. You'll know what I'm saying when you see them.    Yes, this is only my 3rd review (2019), because in my attempt to being more positive, I've decided to only write 5 star reviews.  And ladies and gentlemen, this place is one in my book. So, What are you waiting for? Lol  Try them out for yourself and decide =)  Review #3 -2019",

It was the heaven smelling salt exfoliating scrub, beautiful ambiance in Tivoli, hanging butcher shop as you enter and the super accommodating service that earned the 5 stars. I have been to ALL the fancy French monikered steakhouses on the strip and this will rival them all. You dont fight the tourists for a table, no crowds and the prices are 20% less than the big casino steakhouses.   We got a reservation for our Party of four Saturday 7:45 seating same day. It was crowded and lively but not psycho over crowding and tons of noise.   Ordered:  Carnage-Tomahawk ribeye, pork chop. Both made to perfection  Sides-Corn, chicken fried oysters, asparagus with fried egg, Brussels sprouts, Mac-n-cheese, garlic mashed potatoes  I would probably pass on the asparagus fried egg as it's just that simple. With some flakes of Parmesan cheese. Nothing exciting.   Loved the mushrooms that accompanied the tomahawk. So rich and soft. The house made potato chips disappeared so fast I didnt get a second chip. But the one single chip I had was crispy and tasty.   Can't wait to come back and the 14 other sides that we didn't order.",

Our server Alana was friendly and helpful in answering questions about the menu. Water glasses were immediately filled and the wait time for the food was short. Alana followed up on our satisfaction.  Items ordered were: Butcher's Beef Pot Pie is made with tender chunks of filet mignon and carrots, celery, potatoes and mushrooms in a hearty beef broth. The crust was very flaky. This was a delicious dish that was large enough for two meals.   Over The Rainbow Salad is a healthy bowl of the entire garden. Farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette. A great bounty of flavors. Served in a bowl, I was only able to finish half of it. Plan to enjoy the rest at home.  Again Echo & Rig did not disappoint in service or food. We look forward to returning to enjoy the beautiful second floor outdoor patio during the Spring.",

I loved the fried portabella mushrooms the most, I could have just eaten that for dinner.   I only give three stars for the steak though. My husband and I shared a med rare tomahawk. I can appreciate a well aged steak, but the steak came just under room temperature and I like to have my food at least warm, unless it's sushi. I liked how the steak came with so many accompanying sauces, but ultimately, we only liked the horseradish. I'm a believer that a good steak requires zero enhancements, so the sauces were lost on someone like me. The burnt ends tasted pretty good though, I just wished the whole steak tasted that way.  I can see why this restaurant is popular, the service is attentive and the dining experience can be exceptional.",

They serve champagne with orange juice on the side so you can choose how much to add. Just a splash was enough for me.  Portobello fries and 1/2 inch bacon sides - good starters to share. They serve house made bbq with the bacon, yum!  Steak platter - they bring out ridiculous slabs of beef for you to choose from (New York, T bone, porterhouse, tomahawk). They also had some steaks to choose from their regular dinner menu as well. They overcooked a few of our steak orders unfortunately :((( I would expect a steakhouse to be able to cook steaks to perfection as their specialty.   Steakhouse scramble - I ordered this and really enjoyed the pieces of tender filet mixed with an egg scramble topped with some burrata cheese.",

Got the 36ounce @ $2.59/oz ($93.24) they were out of the rib eye caps which is what we each wanted.   The sides we ordered were the Brussels sprouts ($8.80) & garlic cheddar mash ($6.90).   Our drinks we enjoyed! I got the seasonal sangria ($11.30) and my husband got a Japanese Whiskey on the rocks: Nikki Coffey ($22.00)  Their service was excellent. Never had to ask to have our drinks topped off.   The only con was it was a little too dim where we were sitting but otherwise it was an enjoyable dinner. We will definitely be back...",

The attention to detail from our Server, Ryan was exquisite, as he guided us through the incredible grass fed beef options that rival the finest chop houses in America accompanied by an exciting menu of mains and sides. He provided attentive service throughout our dinner including a delicious salad he brought out on the house that complemented our Tomahawk Steak! The presentation of our dinner was as pleasurable as each bite was too!  I observed the room during our visit and what stood out to me the most was every table was having the same exceptional experience we were. By the time we finished our meal the room was full. The tables are laid out well, so you don't feel you are sharing your meal with the people surrounding you & the acoustics of the room allowed for good table conversation.  A short 20 minute drive from downtown Vegas absolutely is worth every mile to Echo & Rig. This a great place for a date night to a business dinner or any gathering with friends who enjoy a quality meal at a great price point!",

    "text": "Off the Strip, but worth the trip  Echo & Rig is located inside the Tivoli Village Shops 13 miles west of the Strip in Summerlin. If you are visiting Las Vegas, the chances are you have booked your room somewhere on the strip. Thirteen miles might sound too long of a trip to you, but I assure you it is worth your time!  Owner and executive chef Sam Marvin combines butchery with a new concept steakhouse. This place does not look like your traditional steakhouse. Rather, it's an open dining area with a menu that invites diners to learn about the different cuts of meat. The servers can explain  how each cut should be properly prepared, and they should be listened to!   I could go on and on about all the wonderful things about the place, but instead I recommend you pay it a visit and when you do, give yourself enough time and avoid rushing through dinner because it really is a wonderful experience.",

Next time I will order medium. The meat was very tasty, nice char on the outside. It came with yummy potato chips. I had Caesar's salad, very good, creamy dressing just how I like it. We shared Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese, both very good. Hubby had onion soup, like French onion, but with added pumpkin cubes. He liked it and also liked his salmon and spinach entree. We brought our own wine. It was a very enjoyable meal, and we will be back.",

Our waiter Jesse was very nice, even showed us platter with steaks they offer. My husband ordered steakhouse cuts Rib-Eye and I ordered the Spencer steak. As appetizer we had portabello fries - delicious.  But when the steaks arrived, mine looked good, nice thick steak, but very dry inside. My husband's Rib-Eye steak was 1/4inch flat steak and first bite he had to spitted out because it was chewy. he was very dissapointed. I ended up giving him my steak. We called our waiter, saying this place is butcher house and you are serving these tiny flat steak?! He took it back, never asked us if we wanted to order something else, and he said the manager will come to our table and talk to us. Never happened!!! Our waiter asked us 3 times if any of the managers came to our table. I saw managers walking around, talking to each other, practically doing nothing and none of them came and apologize. The owner of this place should fire all the managers right away. Very rude of them. As a hotel concierge on the strip, and I will never recommend this place to the guest or my family and friends!",

When we ate here, there were 3 former Hawaii residents that worked here.  The hostess that seated us was from Maui, one of the servers was from the leeward side on Oahu, and one of the floor managers was from the Big Island.  The very cool thing was they all made it a point to chat a bit about Hawaii.  Well, I've been wanting to eat here ever since I saw chef and owner Sam Marvin on Beat Bobby Flay and the restaurant didn't disappoint.  We started with a cocktail and some apps...the portabello fries and mac n cheese.  Both apps were good with the portabello fries being exceptional. Thick sliced portabello mushrooms battered and deep fried, soft and earthy on the inside and hot and crispy on the outside.  Served with a nice herb aioli to dip into.  For dinner I got the Steakhouse cut Rib eye with red wine reduction and Mark H had the Steakhouse cut Tenderloin with a bearnaise sauce.  Both had a good meaty flavor but I definitely like the fattiness of the rib eye :) .  I also really liked the garlic potato chips that the steak was served with.  Not as filling as having a baked potato so you can focus more on the meat.  The next time I'm here I definitely want to try one of the butcher's cuts.",

This was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Everyone was was so nice and wished us a happy anniversary. Our waiter, Hugo was amazing. He was very nice and made sure we were happy with our meal. Nicholas was also very attentive. Besides the staff being so wonderful the food was AMAZING. We ordered the Bacon to start off and that was delicious. I ordered the Rib Eye Cap and my boyfriend ordered the Spencer steak, we were both very pleased. My favorite part of the meal was the MAC N CHEESE!!! Omg!!! It was THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. I'm so sad because I wanted to bring the left overs with me and they were nice enough to pack my Mac n cheese and I forgot it!!! I almost cried in the car ride back to our hotel.... NO LIE. They also gave us a complimentary dessert. We got the chocolate cherry it was sooo yummy! I can't wait to come back here. Thank you to the staff for making our day a memorable one.",

The restaurant owner greeted everyone as they were seated and the service was exceptional. Servers gave knowledgeable suggestions for which cut would be tastiest when cooked to a certain degree. Appetizers are yummy so don't skip out. Would recommend trying the cauliflower!!  Went for a birthday dinner so everyone ordered a bit of everything. Pick your favorite cut and you can't go wrong. The bathrooms have salt scrub you can purchase before you leave. Also a butcher shop if you want to pick up fresh meats :) Will have to come by to try other things on the menu!",

First time, I went for a business lunch, second time for my anniversary dinner, and third time for a dinner with friends.   Service here is excellent. On the night of anniversary, the hostess who sat us congratulated us, then our server did, then the floor manager did... everyone who came to our table congratulated us. But without being overbearing. How perfect is that?! The servers never let your glass get empty and are very attentive. They're really wonderful!!  Food wise, I have yet to have anything I disliked on their menu. The mac & cheese, watermelon salad, lamb cigars, steak tartare, mashed potatoes and cauliflower are all amazing. I've had the beef tenderloin (filet) twice and a hanger steak once, both delicious beyond belief. For dessert, I've only had the berry shortcake sundae, but I've had it twice so hopefully that tells you how delicious it is.   I can't rave enough about this place. It's seriously really great food & service. The drinks from the bar are delicious too. And there's a butcher shop! I haven't bought anything from the butcher shop, but it is a thing.",

It was about 4pm on a Fri, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated in the restaurant upstairs immediately upon arrival. Our server Nicholas was an absolute pleasure to deal with. He was very thorough in explaining the whole menu and even brought out a steak tray to see for some off menu selections. (I'm going back for the tomahawk next time!!) He was very accommodating to our son who was eating with us to make sure that the way their items were prepared were suitable for him to eat as well.   We started with the Caesar salad, which one order can be split between two people just fine. Portobello fries - quite unique, never had these anywhere else. They were quite tasty.  For our main course the wife got the ribeye cap and I went with the spencer steak. They were only 8oz portions but were perfectly sized to go with the broccolini and Mac and cheese we ordered. (Broccolini was a little heavy in oil but hell its deep fried, Mac and cheese was amazing) The steaks came out great, my only criticism is that we ordered medium rare and they definitely came out medium.. BUT every single good steakhouse I've ever been to seems to have that issue anyway. So.. I suggest ordering one temp cooler than you want to stay within your liking.   We were treated to a complimentary ice cream dessert for my wife's birthday which was much appreciated. This place was definitely a cut above the rest, especially considering their very reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back to order the tomahawk RARE. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.",

The server was very knowledgeable and we did request he bring out one of their \"boards\" with their featured steak.  We did end up ordering one with some sides and sauces and it was absolutely delicious! We split their smallest option (which was still huge), the mushroom it came it (tasty), a sweet potato, carrots, and broccolini. We probably could've done without one of the sides as the steak came with potato chips, however we couldn't turn down a sweet potato! The steak was cooked perfectly and sliced neatly making it easy for us to share. All the sides were hot and delicious.  We were so full we had to skip dessert, but I will definitely be returning here again!   The reason this is not a five star review is because although we were seated inside, we were near the door to outside and every time it opened I was freezing cold and it would take me a minute or two to warm up again--only for them to open the door again. This obviously is a winter problem only, but still affected my dinner quality.",

    "text": "Ummm... Where do I begin? Restaurant & Butcher, yes please! So we drive about 20-30 off the strip on a Saturday night with our party of 6, totally worth it. This place was recommended by some of our local friends so we ventured there not sure of what to expect. We were quickly seated and met with a manager to explain everything and make recommendations. They make almost everything from scratch and butcher all meats in house. Our waiter started our order of black n blue mojitos for the whole table. Pretty good but just one was missing the simple syrup, easy fix. We were told about the house specialty cuts off the regular menu, where you pay by the ounce. They bring a tray of beautiful meats and you can pick your steak if you choose. They also suggest family style dining, which is right up our alley. We picked a 32 oz porterhouse and a 46 ounce tomahawk for the table to share. Then we pick a large assortment of starters and sides to share. A couple musts here are the portabella fries with the most delicious aioli and carne asada bone marrow, that you will want to lick the plate clean (we doubled our order of both after we tasted it). So to name a few other things we got, Caesar salad, cucumber watermelon tomato and onion salad. We had garlic mashed potatoes w/ white cheddar, baked mac n 7 cheeses, roasted broccolini, roasted cauliflower with Chiles, grilled octopus with gigante beans and green olives. All of these items paired with 2 huge, delicious steaks, hand carved at the table! So much food and we did not finish it all. Just an amazing dinner and very reasonably priced. They were busy, so the service slowed up at the end but all in all, a worth while visit. I would definitely make this a must try, if you are going to Vegas. They said they may open a second location in Sacramento... I will  make that drive, if it's anything like the Vegas location. Around  $400 with tip, for a high quality meal for 6, with cocktails, appetizers, salads, sides! This is a Las Vegas staple!!!!",

The thing is - I am a card-carrying vegan. And this classy joint has hunks of meat showcased right at the entrance. Hello, carcass!! So why on earth would I not only go, but actually choose this place to brunch?!  The avocado toast. The breakfast potatoes. And this fried spinach salad that I am pretty sure was blessed by the pop himself because damn, it was good.   Despite the carnal offerings in the window, Echo & Rig offers an upscale option for discerning vegans. Don't get me wrong, I love my local tofu-scramble cafe as much as the next chakra-cleared eggplant eater. But that's eating, and sometimes you want to dine.   Our waitress, Rae I think her name was, should open up a hospitality school. You know those people who are so wonderful and nice it actually makes you a little uncomfortable? That was her. I basically felt like a selfish slob compared to her manners and grace. She was incredible.   Word to the wise: when you order the fried spinach salad, make sure you ask for the dressing to be made without the fish sauce.   Or just order some carbs with your carbs- potatoes and avocado toast- and those bottomless mimosas - and cry on a treadmill later.",

Who knew cauliflower could be so good?! They are also very thoughtful and generous when it comes to celebrating something with you by offering a free dessert.   But my lowered rating has to do with the steak... and that's also because it is one of the main huge features of this restaurant. Maybe this is the norm, but the outside of our steaks were blackened and burnt to the point where it was inedible. It also stank of gas. I'm used to more of a charcoal or smoke flavor, and not burnt to the point I can still enjoy it with the center. Despite the outside being burnt, the inside was soft and flavorful once you got past that.   I may change my rating as I go back to try brunch, burgers, and other things. But unfortunately my expectations were way high and I had gone on this trip for that particular thing: red meat.",

Two of us had the Spencer Steak, Another the steak pot pie and One of us had the Butcher Burger. All the food was fantastic with the exception of the beef pot pie which was a little too salty. They gave us two complimentary sundaes that were also delicious for two of the girls birthdays this month. The service was good and very attentive to our needs.

And I think all around, everything has been really fantastic including the food, service, and ambiance.  I've been here for dinner and I've loved everything that I've ordered here. I recently came by to check out their brunch, and from what I can tell, they got their brunch game on point.  The first thing I noticed on the menu was the bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Nothing goes better with brunch then a good Bloody Mary. I really like the one that Echo & Rig makes. It's not too spicy, and has a really nice kick to it. I also ordered their short rib hash. The short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked. The hollandaise sauce was magical, and the poached egg on top really sealed the deal for me. Our server was a rockstar, and did a wonderful job.  If you have never been to Echo & Rig, I would highly recommend that you check it out. There's always been a great experience every time I've been there. Vegas is known for their steak houses, and this place does not disappoint.",

    "text": "Came here twice and the two experiences were so different. First the place is really cool, located in Tivoli Village near Summerlin, it is a nice place to walk around when the weather is nice. The restaurant itself is two-story high, they have a see-through fridge on the bottom floor that lets you look at all the meats they use for the restaurant. They also have a bar area and lounge area for you to sit and wait. Then you walk upstairs and that is where the main dinning area is.   The first I was here everything was amazing. Service was great, food was good, had a great time and everything was great.   Came back the second time with my entire family to celebrate my sister's birthday since we enjoyed the experience the first time. This time was not so great. Our server seemed really busy and distracted, he would talk to us while looking at his other tables which I thought was really rude. He then spilled water all over the table when he poured water for my mom and I and ignored the incident, didn't apologize or even clean up the water, my mother and I used our own napkin to clean the water up because it was a mess. I looked at him kind of taken back but of course he wasn't even looking at me, he was looking elsewhere.   We did not say anything because we did not want to make a big deal but that was a terrible start to the dinner. The rest of the meal went fine, for appetizers we ordered: calamari, steak tartare, porky belly and spicy slaw, bone marrow carne asada, and lump crab cake. The apps were all  very good.   The pork chop schnitzel was really dried and the flavor was not impressive. The rest of the food was really good, we ordered different steaks, duck and fish.   Then I told our server that it was my sister's birthday and I asked for some kind of cake with candles, which the restaurant gave us for free for her birthday. The runner, not the server, that brought out the ice cream lighted the candle and said \"Here you go\" and pretty much threw it on the table without any enthusiasm. Im sure they have many birthday celebrations here and it wasn't his first time doing it, but come on! For a place that is considered fine dinning I expect better service ... he can't find it in himself to say \"Happy Birthday\" or even just a smile? It made us feel like he didn't want to be there or he didn't like giving us the ice cream... the dinner started out bad and ended bad.  I really liked the food but the service we got that night was terrible.",

Three of us ordered the rib-eye caps and my husband ordered the strip steak which was good but not great. The rib-eye caps were burnt .I mean each dinner meat alone was $31 we also ordered sides dishes. Disappointed!!!!!! I could buy a better cut meats at Costco and cooked it at home. Our waitress, busboys and the manager were attentive. We are definitely NOT coming back. Too bad as is close to our home",

And beyond the inability of the staff to properly answer phones or return calls to confirm reservations ... I'm still giving it a stellar review. This is a note to inform management how important it is to call clients back ...  no matter how busy the restaurant gets. I left a message 4 days ago and no return call. I kept calling and no one ever answers the phone. So I kept calling (about 10 times to be exact) and finally got a hold of someone but the reservation was not on the books. The guy was nice and got us in at a later time, but sadly couldn't confirm the balcony as requested because there are large parties out there.   What if this was an important event?  A birthday or an anniversary??  What then?  We could have taken our business somewhere else, but why?  This place is amazing and it was the choice made. Trust me, I get how crazy running a restaurant can be. I've done it :.. it's exhausting to say the least. But one thing I never faltered on was customers first and food quality. Everything else was secondary.   Write down all messages. Names and phone. Call EVERY CUSTOMER back. Even if it's to say \"sorry were booked at this time, can we accommodate you in another way\". Easy!    Just hope they figure out a structure that works for them",

Little did we know what poor service was awaiting us. When the waiter we nick named Houdini due do his disappearing skills finally took our order we waited another 40-60 min for our food. When our food eventually arrived at the table three of the steaks were rare to raw in the middle when asked to be medium to well. The other non steak dish was served cold and no it wasn't supposed to be cold. Drinks often sat empty needing refills and when we advised Houdini about our issues he had the manager come to our table to look at our food. The manager seemed like he didn't care much but assured us that he would make sure we were compensated for the food. The brought out a desert on the house and Mr Houdini made a joke about this is supposed to be cold. His little joke we did not find amusing. This place is over priced and has poorly prepared food. Save your money, I've had better steaks at Outback Steakhouse.",

The service is decent they were very busy so they didn't come by the table a much as we hoped for. I didn't get drink refills and they didn't bring out the bread til much later. There is a wait so it's better to make a reservation ahead of time. Overall the price of the food is about $25-35 but the food was definitely tasty. :)",

The ambience is calming and refreshing and so chic. Very much a perfect fit for beautiful Tivoli Square .  While they do not  accept reservations the wait has never been a problem . Oftentimes a waiter will come out with a tray of that day's appetizer special to give you a hint if the delicious food to come.   We were fortunate to meet the owner, Sam Marvin and his sister, Cheryl Best. Just fantastic people. I enjoyed them just about as much as the food!  I have heard that Mr. Marvin will soon open another eatery on the Strip and I eagerly await this new restaurant.",

    "text": "The best restaurant to come along in quite some time. They don't take reservations, but it gave me time to go check out the specialty cocktail menu. For $8, these drinks are a preview of how reasonable the rest of the menu is. I tried the bourbon peach tree cocktail and it was heavy on the alcohol. Besides the bourbon, all you can taste is the mint. It was not well balanced, but for someone who likes their brown liquors, this is great. I still liked it. The Hot & Bothered was my favorite though. The mixture of spicy and sweet was phenomenal. The mango syrup was not too overbearing and the spice lingered on your lips.   I sat in the lounge for 20 minutes before someone came to get my guest and I. We were taken upstairs to our table. Within minutes our server came by to introduce herself and I tried to get a few recommendations. With such a spectrum of items being suggested, it did not make it any easier.   What we ended up deciding on was astounding. For starters, we got the \"over the rainbow\" salad and the bone marrow carne asada. Holy cow are they amazing. The best contrast of something healthy with a heart stopping appetizer. The mixture of grains with corn and veggies had me shoveling it down. The fatty goodness of the bone marrow had me wanting more. A squeeze of orange cuts the fat. As our protein, we went with the Spencer steak. $25 for a ten ounce steak with housemade chips and a mushroom rockefeller. What a deal! When we got it, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. With that, you get a choice of sauce. Initially, we ordered the green peppercorn thinking it would pack some bold heat. It is more creamy and possessed little flavor. Afterwards, we asked for the chimichurri and that was much better. The capers in it had me scooping it up. Adding the crispy cauliflower tossed with chili de arbol and portabello fries was more than enough for two. If I had to choose between the two again, I'd go with the former. The sweet and spice of the florets had me wanting to plan another visit. The meatiness of the fries were good, but the aioli was what made them. We were dipping anything we could get our hands on in it. I was ready to tap out, but Sarah Marie wanted to see the dessert menu. They don't have one, but our server broke down all of their desserts for us. They only have sundaes. I was a littl surprised by that, but I am a huge ice cream fan. We ended up with the salted turtle sundae. The roasted peanuts, toffee pieces, salted caramel, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream was to die for. We were filled to the brim, but that sundae did not go to waste.   All in all, it was the best dining experience I could have asked for. We ended up hanging out there for quite some time. Their timing was perfect. I didn't even realize that we had a three hour dining experience because they always had something in front of us and the pace was so controlled.",

The specialty is the grass fed beef and it is quite special indeed. All the servers are knowledgeable about the menu and management visits the table to make you feel special and make the experience a nice one. Besides the menu there is a chef's special menu which is different every night. The ribeye I ordered was cooked to perfection topped with a delicious garlic butter sauce.

We decided to try this restaurant after seeing the chef/owner on the Food Network show, Beat Bobby Flay. (He did beat him in the cooking contest which is very rare.) Upon hearing we had never been there before, our server brought us a complimentary tray of meats and sausages made on the premises in the butcher shop...delicious. The rib eye steaks were juicy and cooked perfectly. The portobello fries were delicious as our server had promised. The mashed potato side was more than enough for two people. There was a small hiccup in our service and they went above and beyond to rectify it. The short trip off the Strip is well worth it and I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to going again on our next trip.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d4828601-r287685410-Echo_and_Rig-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=6c1e7621a8760f86aa3c55be85884f9d92ab1bde5a65d9efbcdf2a20be105b64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

He was condescending and every time one of us asked about menu options he tried to downplay the portion size and quality to up-sell us to a steak that was off the menu. I ended up ordering a porterhouse, not knowing the price and found out that it was a $90 steak once the bill came. The steak was nowhere near worth $90. Was it good? Yes...but I've had MUCH better in town for far less....and I feel like I was duped when ordering it.   When we sat down to order we all ordered various small plates to share to get the dinner started. We were in no rush and just wanted to enjoy the experience and food. We told this to James our server and he became irritated that we'd be taking our time. Keep in mind our reso was for 8:30pm and we didn't get seated till 8:50pm...so it's not like they were going to turn the table again after us.   James tried rushing us into ordering entrees again once our appetizers hit the table and rolled his eyes at us when we told him we weren't ready to order. He started going on about how the kitchen needed time to cook the steaks because of their thickness and again we had to explain we weren't in a rush....and we didn't even say we were ordering steaks at this point.   When a guest isn't ready to order....they aren't ready to order.   We eventually got our food and while there were some hits and misses on the table, overall the food was good...but not worth the price. For $400 for a party of 4 I would have MUCH rather gone to Carnevino or another steakhouse on the strip.  James was tipped 10% because of the poor quality of service, the misrepresentation of their pricing and his condescending attitude. I knew I did the right thing by tipping him that amount when we came by to grab the signed bill while we were still leaving the table, saw he was tipped $40, scoffed and gave us dirty looks.   For the record, I'm usually a 25-30% tipper when the service is good and when I know I'm taking up a table a little longer than most guests in a server's section. There was no need for James to be sneaky with the pricing. If a steak is $90...then it's $90...but tell me that it's $90 upfront.",

Chef Sam Marvin is on top of everything and welcomed us.  Manager Kevin stopped for an enjoyable chat and congrats.  Our server, Celine, was absolute tops. We enjoyed a table with a kitchen view, but outside dining was also available. My wife had the Spencer steak, and I tried something new - the bavette.  All I can say is wow.  It is my new favorite!  The portabello fries are a must, too. Chef Sam said they will be opening another location in downtown Sacramento this summer.  Keep your eyes open if you are up that way.",

We had to flag down someone else on several occasions when we needed something.  Food was very good, and atmosphere, while very minimalist, we also all liked.  I also found the prices quite reasonable, considering what most LV steakhouses charge.   An excellent choice for the money.",

    "text": "I wish I could give it a 4.5 out of 5, because it wasn't absolutely flawless, but it was still pretty great in almost every way. I would HIGHLY recommend this place.  My boyfriend and I went to dinner at 9 PM on Tuesday night, and although we were there two hours before closing, we were still one of two tables inside. The patio seemed decently full though. Upon sitting down, the manager Jason came by to welcome us back as we had dined their before and basically thank us for choosing Echo & Rig. After Jason leaves, our server arrives and goes over the menu. We ordered a caesar salad to start, a glass of wine and flat water.   Caesar was very good, our server even split it for us instead of us having to share the same plate. The dressing is very rich, but none the less, still good.   After our app is cleared, we order our dinner. I ordered the filet (medium), and my boyfriend orders the ribeye, medium as well. As for sides, we ordered the black tuscan kale and the macaroni and cheese.  My only real issue that evening was our steaks. My steak arrives, it's cooked perfectly. It's definitely a more sad piece of filet, as there was a tendon running through it, but it was cooked perfectly and flavored amazing. Ultimately, I give the filet a 4.5 out of 5. My boyfriend's ribeye, completely well. Nowhere near medium. Maybe near medium well, and that's generous. However, our server was more than willing (and it didn't seemed bothered or annoyed) to send his ribeye back to get it recooked.  A short time later, his steak arrives, cooked basically perfect. We were happy. We enjoyed our dinner as the sides were amazing. The macaroni and cheese is gooey and great, and the tuscan kale is my favorite side dish in this city.  When the dessert menu is presented, the manager stops by one more time and informs us that dessert was on the house due to the mistake with the steak. We were absolutely thrilled. Not only did the replace the steak promptly, but they really went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional despite the hiccup.   Ultimately, I think this is a great more fairly priced steakhouse. It's not the upscale steakhouse where the atmosphere is stuffy. At 35 dollars for a 7 oz filet you can't be mad at all. Sides are priced fairly, and portions are good. They have a gorgeous patio that's great for these nice summer nights, and it's great to get away from the strip. I would definitely recommend, and I will be back!",

This place was not on my list of bookmarks and I was pretty set on not liking it before I even gave it a shot. The visible meat in the fridge by the front door was enough to turn my stomach. However, the service had already beat the view wine bar before we even sat down. I'm big on service, so it was a very good start. The menu was really interesting. The veggies looked and sounded superb. The cauliflower was so good!! They used Evo instead of butter and I can honestly say we had to order another serving... . The Brussel sprouts were seriously... Amazing!!! The sweet potatoe was cooked perfectly. I want to go back and try the greens and grains and over the rainbow salad. The wine was also very good. Their happy hour was also rather impressive for any carnivore looking for something decent that won't break the bank. $1.99 Steak & Egg, $1.99 Shrimp Cocktail, and $1 Fresh Butcher Hot Dogs, nothing I could eat but our friends and my boyfriend tried it all and it was a pretty nice serving for the price. It was after 10pm when we sat down so I'm assuming it started around then. All in all the service was exceptional. The bartender the with dark hair and full beard was full of suggestions and even walked upstairs to check with the kitchen about the Brussels sprouts. The drinks were good and we never ran out of water. I will definitely be back!",

Let me start by saying that Echo & Rig made my birthday celebration real special.  From the great customer service when I made the reservation to how we were greeted and treated that night.  There were 8 of us, and the managers came to great us, wished me a great birthday, and the fun kicked into high gear.  First the meats - beautifully presented and cooked to perfection.  We had the biggest cowboy steaks I have ever seen and 2 massive Porterhouses.  The sides were delicious - try the carrots, bacon, bone marrow, portobello mushrooms.  The wine selections was fantastic- we had the Petite Syrah and the Bordeaux.  Best of all, was the great service!  Our server was great.  This was our first dining experience at Echo & Rig, and she walked us through whole experience, including the meat, wine, sides, and desert selections.  She checked on us often and was super attentive.  The great new is that Echo & Rig is opening a restaurant in Sacramento.  I get a feeling that we will be regular customers.",

Great steaks, the spicy cauliflower side is excellent, and the portobello fries made my mom and I get into an argument over who got the last one.  The sandwiches at lunch can tend to be greasy, but they are delicious (especially The Drunken Goat).  BUT, the restaurant is not my favorite thing about this place.  The BUTCHER SHOP is.  We come here to get all of our steaks.  The butchers are so nice, helpful, and friendly.  They make some excellent rillette if you can catch it before it sells out!  The steaks are high quality, and not much more expensive than buying them at the grocery store.  One other note: we have ordered Thanksgiving To-Go twice from them, and it is convenient, fast, and delicious.  I like how everything is ready to go for you, but you still get the \"Thanksgiving smell\" like you've been cooking all day when you stick the bird in the oven to fully cook it.  I took off a star for some small things that bother me, but may not bother others: I'm not a big fan of their cocktail list (but I like their wine list), the restaurant tends to get very LOUD (so I always sit on the patio when able), and sometimes I feel like we have 6 waiters because so many people come to the table to take orders and say hello (it's a bit overbearing for me, but I bet some people like all the service).",

The wait staff was always there, whether to refill the water, or take plates away or simply to ask how everything was going. We were very impressed with everyone knowing our names and welcoming us to the restaurant. It was definitely a nice touch. The restaurant itself is beautiful - the ambiance is perfect for a nice night out.   Ok, so now on to the bad. First, and foremost, the beef is NOT PRIME grade. That's extremely disappointing, especially when you consider the fact that the cuts are sold at prime market prices. Our steaks (bone in ribeye) had a tremendous amount of fat on them and quite frankly, the steaks were completely raw in some areas. I also didn't like how they cut the steak for us before bringing it to the table.  I question whether they allowed the steak to rest for several minutes before serving, because the meat was very hot when it arrived. Steak like this needs to rest before it's cut, otherwise it takes away from the flavor because the juices are not given enough time to return to the meat. They also left huge chunks of fat on the plate. Not sure what that was about. The dessert was also very lack luster. I had the apple pie sundae and the apples were completely raw, there was no sauce and the cookies were hard.  Not impressed.",

The only reason it did not get all 5 stars is because I had just went to RPM Steak in Chicago and that was so deserving of all 5 stars.

Everything look great.  We were seated and ordered a few dishes for us to share. My favorite was the Over the Rainbow Farro/Quinoa salad. I'm a big fan of farro, so was really happy to see it on the menu. It was big enough to share and had lots of \"stuff,\" so it wasn't only grains. We also order the Roasted Chicken sandwich, Crab Cake, and house made charcuterie. The Charcuterie was also great. It had a nice mix of types of animals, spiciness, and flavors.

Kevin Naylor killed it by giving wonderful recommendations. We were a table of four, as recommended by the staff we shared family style a perfectly cooked 30 ounce t bone, the fried spinach salad (this salad was amazing), heirloom carrots and Brussels sprouts.  The cocktails were delicious and the wine selection was legit.  Me and the gals could not stop talking about our meal on the following day. We will definitely be back.",

They do take reservations so it's best to give them a call ahead of time.  Tivoli Village also has valet parking.",

    "text": "A spectacular experience.   This was our first time actually dining at Echo and Rig. Having purchased from the butcher counter before (it's a great place to get quality meat after exploring the Tivoli Village Farmer's Market!) we knew our expectations would be high for the restaurant itself.   When my boyfriend made our reservation, he mentioned to the hostess that we would be celebrating our second anniversary. The hostess told us that they would make sure it was a special night for us... And they really, really did. It's not an exaggeration to say that every single person who came to our table -- from the restaurant manager, to our waiter, to the bus boys, to the servers who refilled our drinks and brought out the food, to the guy who lit a candle on our celebratory sundae -- EVERYONE knew that it was our anniversary. We were congratulated at least 10 different times! It was such a nice touch that truly made us feel like VIPs.   The service was wonderful. Our waiter, Ari, was knowledgable, friendly, and patient. He had some knockout suggestions and a fantastic way with words. Everything he described sounded delectable. It was a wonder we didn't order one of everything. The restaurant manager was lovely, visiting us at the beginning and the end of our meal to ensure we had a nice time. All of the other waitstaff were rockstars too. The only hiccup was that Ari seemed like he was juggling too many tables at the beginning of our visit. My boyfriend wishes we had a bit more interaction with him while we were in the process of exploring the menu/asking questions, etc.   The atmosphere was modern and clean, but the music was a bit too loud for my taste. I was hoping for more romantic ambiance -- but that might have just been a bias, since it was our anniversary.   And now, of course -- THE FOOD! We sampled:  -- grilled thick-cut bacon with homemade BBQ sauce. OMG. If you get NOTHING else, GET THIS! The sauce was fabulous. (Ari said he pours it over ice cream. After tasting it, I can see why!) The bacon was thick, juicy, and oh-so smoky! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   -- sweet fire cauliflower. This wasn't my favorite. It was tasty, for sure, but there were other things on the table that made me happier.   -- 32 oz tomahawk steak, for two. During the ordering process, Ari brought us out a VERY IMPRESSIVE tray of raw meat. The thing probably weighed 10 pounds! We chose directly from the tray, opting to have our steak cooked medium rare. (Boyfriend likes rare, and I prefer medium... The steak was cooked and then sliced in such a way that I got the more cooked outer slices, while my boyfriend enjoyed the rarer center.) The best part were those outer edges, where the fat got crispy and delicious. One bite, and the fat would just pop and melt in your mouth. Sooooo good. However, I did notice that some bites were rather chewy. Could have been the cut of the meat. This was my first tomahawk!   -- sauces! We tried charred onion, horseradish cream, brandied mushroom, bearnaise, and red wine demi. All were awesome, but I loved the mushroom and bearnaise best.   -- garlic potato chips. Duh. What's not to love?!   -- caramel turtle sundae. Yes to the yes to the yes. Just get it. Salted caramel ice cream, homemade sauce, fresh whipped cream! Ready, GO!   All in all, it was a great anniversary meal. I'm grateful to the staff at Echo and Rig for making it such a special night. I am sure we will be back!",

    "text": "With all of the hype and the paid advertisement in Urban Daddy, I thought I might make the trek off the strip to Echo and Rig.  It was advertised as butcher shop where you can pick your meat and they will cook it for you.  All the meats are grass fed and come from California.  Upon walking in, you see the butchers in action slicing meats, making sausages, and grinding beef for meatballs and hamburgers.  They don't take reservations, so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table.  The good thing is that they have a bar with 3-4 bartenders slinging up craft cocktails and making a great impression.  The bartender even gave us some complimentary shots of jalapeno infused tequila which seemed to improve our moods.  The drinks were $8, which is reasonable compared to $15-$18 drinks on the strip, so that worked well for us.    After a 15 minute wait, we got a table and a great personable server.  They presented us with the selections of meats on a platter, which were supposedly steaks for 2 people.  I could have easily eaten their NY Strip which was 24 ounces and sold by the ounce ($2.29/ounce).  So yea, it would have been a $50+ steak.   We opted for for the hangar steak with chimichurri ($22.5) and the Ribeye ($34.50) along with a couple of appetizers of Portobello Fries and a Charcuterie platter with assorted meats.  The portobello fries were delicious and the charcuterie platter was a very good.  Then the main course came.  My Ribeye was about 10 ounces for $34 and was MAYBE 3/4 inch thick.  It was well cooked, but one of the worst ribeyes that I have eaten in a long time.  I get better meat at Sam's club.  The Hangar steak was charred on the outside and chewy as all hell. The portion size of the Hangar steak was probably about 5-6 ounces and even though it is probably the correct amount of food per dietary guidelines as a serving, it was small and we did not leave feeling full, but left with a bill of over $150.  I would try it again, but I wouldn't go back for dinner.  Maybe their sandwiches and lunch selections will be a bit better.",

I ordered the short rib hash and the steak frites for entrees, and a crab cake and avocado toast as well. They were all very delicious. And brunch would not be complete without bottomless mimosas which they offered for 16$. The only star off is for our server. He was not very attentive. The server assistants were much more interested in helping us, which was much appreciated. Again, I will be back!",

Other people came in after we checked in and were seated before us.  We were the last ones waiting.  I was already unhappy.  After we were seated, it took 15 minutes before I had to tell our server we were ready to order.  When we finally got our steaks (NY, filet, Spencer, and ribeye) and they were just okay.  I ordered the ribeye and I thought they gave me the NY steak.  No marbling and no flavor!!  No one was impressed with their steaks.  I had a more flavorful filet at TGIFridays!!  This was really disappointing! :(",

    "text": "Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of 6. We were warned that Tuesday was their busiest night but we didn't expect to wait for a table for over an hour. However, that gave us time to check out the butcher case and speak with one of the butchers, Kilan. He offered us a bite of some beef jerky they made the previous night, which was delicious. Also, the butcher working the cold meats section near the stairs took pity on us and offered a little appetizer which was also good.  We finally got seated at our table. Unfortunately, it was right next to the kitchen and in a draft zone. Whenever someone opened the door to the patio, the cold air swept in. Again, manage my took pity on us and tried to warn their servers to close the door behind them. Sometimes they forgot so we had to get up ourselves to shut the door.   We ordered the calamari and crab cakes for appetizers and they were both delicious. The aoli for the calamari was perfect. I had a couple of bites of my friend's over-the-rainbow salad and I wanted to order one for myself since it was so good. I ordered the skirt steak with a chimichurri sauce for my main course. My steak was cooked perfectly but was a bit on the salty side. I also ordered a side of roasted cauliflower which was fantastic. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the jumping beef which was apparently filet mignon with peppers and onions and a kind of light gravy. It came a little too well done when he had asked for it to be medium rare so he only ate a few bites. The coffee dessert was a nice ending to my meal and everyone else enjoyed their desserts.   Service was great, everyone was exceptionally friendly. Food was ok/good with the exception of the well done beef, which was comped along with a few of the desserts. I would come back and give this place another try.",

I'm so glad we did. I adored my dinner. It was delicious. I had the black spaghetti, watermelon salad, chocolate cherry sundae, and white sangria. Everything was delicious. The spaghetti wasn't fishy at all, the acidity of the sauce balanced everything out. The watermelon salad was crisp and refreshing. The sundae was pretty standard, but still yummy. The white sangria was delicious and refreshing as well. The prices were absolutely incredible as well. I wish Echo & Rig was closer to Los Angeles because I would absolutely visit more if it was.",

A couple or three visits after a disastrous summer where they made you feel cheap, looked down upon you for bringing in your own bottle, and upselling the crap out of you (COME ON, TWO TOMAHAWKS FOR 4 PEOPLE?!  OR 6 APPETIZERS FOR 4 PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH FOR THE TABLE??), I have not seen it since.    Our last visit was the night before the Rock And Roll Marathon, manager Xavier took care of us and pretty much any manager that walked by checked in on us.  Xavier did an excellent job always being there for us and checking in on us.  The food is always good but our server that night did need a little help with his culinary vocabulary.  Butterflying the meat doesn't mean cutting it in half.   People who are reading, the meat here is not ruined by unnecessary (but sometimes yummy) stuff thrown on it.  It will be undercooked so it's easier to (raise) or get the temp you want.  Well done E&R, I'll be back soon!  And thanks again Xavier for listening.",

When we walked in, it didn't seem very impressive because it is somewhat sterile in the downstairs lobby. The dining room is upstairs and the lower level is a butcher shop, which is basically how this restaurant exists.   The cuts are all so amazing. I ate way too much because it just felt like a waste to leave a bite on my plate  At our table, we had the rib eye (not the cap--that's mostly the fat), the brisket and the Spencer steak. Each of us loved our choices. We got the portabella mushroom fries (amazing, you should try them), ahi poke, cucumber watermelon and tomatoe salad, Mac n cheese and the Brussels sprouts. The only one that was just ok was the sprouts. The others were outstanding.   Ally was our server and she did an awesome job of making us feel special and attended to. This is a hidden gem. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. Plan to spend about $60 per parson (or more if you drink a lot and add on dessert).   Yes!!! This is a winner. Can't wait to return.",

The restaurants at the hotel got dismal reviews, as expected, so we found E&R on Yelp, and I am SO glad we did.  Walking by the Ferraris and Porsches parked in the valet right outside, we entered around 5pm on a Saturday and were greeted by the hostesses. We didn't have a reservation, and they said the next spot for dinner wasn't until 9:30pm...but that we could take any of the open seats at the wide-open bar area and have the full dinner menu. We happily took the high-top right next to the window and I immediately ordered a Moscow Mule.  Even though we were seated in the bar area, service throughout was awesome. Our server went through her recommendations for appetizers and main courses. We had the portobello mushroom fries for our app which were...so incredible. Highly recommend.  For entrees, my wife had the Shrimp and Artichoke dish and I had the Spencer Steak. Both were delicious. Countless times throughout the meal, my wife and I looked at each other and wondered if this was one of the best meals we've ever had. Everything just tasted so good.  The decor and feel of the place is awesome too; classy, but not too fancy. A lot to look at in the lobby as the raw bar is right there along with the butcher shop area and other cool stuff they sell.  Get to Echo & Rig; truly a 5 star experience.",

Our flutes never saw the bottom of the glass. I've had dinner before which was outstanding. The food quality was marvelous. The overall experience was Great. The restaurant was bright and cheery. And due to the summer Vegas heat they offered inside air conditioned seating or outdoor seating with the misters on. Everything we tried we enjoyed.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this off with one simple statement: the food here is AMAZING. I'm stingy with stars, but Echo earned all 5 of them easily.   There were four of us in our party. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and we found this place. When we first walked in, we were a bit taken aback because we didn't realize there were two floors to the building. Downstairs is a full meat market and bar area, while the restaurant resides upstairs.   Ok, now onto the food. We started with several \"small plates\": Ahi Poke Tuna, Portabella Fries, Cucumber/Watermelon Salad. For me, the portabella fries were the hit of the appetizers, nicely seasoned and cooked and comes with a fantastic dipping sauce. The cucumber salad was also very good and refreshing. After that we got to the meat: Spencer steak, 2 Rib Eyes, and Brisket. All of the steaks were cooked to our individual requests and we all raved to each other about how great they were. My brisket was very tender and flavorful. My wife's rib eye was also very tender. We also ordered \"small plates\" of mac & cheese and brussel sprouts.  Nothing we ordered was disappointing.   Our server, Allie, was a rock star. She was attentive and helpful, her service helped to enhance our overall experience. If you're anywhere near the Vegas area, get ti Echo and Rig. I'm already looking forward to going back.",

The avocado toast and brie in sourdough with a cherry fruit sauce...very flavorful. The only thing that was strange was they served chips with the steaks. Other than that it was a wonderful meal.",

The manager came to the table to introduce our waiter. He promptly took our drink orders then.... Disappeared. He was chatting with the table next to us for awhile before we got his attention.   When we finally ordered, we ordered appetizers and meals all together. We were so hungry! So we told him to being everything out as soon as it was done. He was nice though. It was brunch, and he let us order the Mac and cheese and cauliflower from the lunch menu.   The initial round of appetizers came out. But we're sitting right next to the kitchen. And those 2 orders of Mac and cheese (which can only be ours) is sitting under the earner light.. Its been there for 15 minutes.   .....  Yay! We finally get our food! It is now 3:02pm. We waited about an hour to get our main course. And everything came out all at once. Including those 2 orders of Mac and cheese we saw sitting on the line. Everything tasted pretty good. But 3 of us ordered the burger. We all asked for it to be cut in half. Only one was. 2 were supposed to be medium, 1 was supposed to be medium raw. But all 3 came out medium raw and cold. Like so very pink/red in the middle that I questioned if I could eat it. I'm pregnant so I can't take chances. I left it alone. Instead, I ate up the rest of my husband's grilled cheese. That was VERY GOOD.   Even though the Mac and cheese sat there for a long time, it was amazingly still cheesy and tasted quite delicious.   Overall everyone liked their food. (Except the raw burgers) and the fact that it was all rather cold already. The experience was nice. At the end, the server gave us a free sundae of our choice because it was my sister's birthday.   But if you're in a hurry. You can't eat here. We got here at 1:45p and are leaving now at 3:55p. And its not because we sat around chatting. We spent a majority of our time just waiting on food (chatting too of course) but the food took very long!  Giving 3 stars because food took forever and burgers were not cooked as ordered.",

Finding the perfect balance requires well crafted food, good champagne, and great customer service. Highly recommended, Echo and Rig delivered.  The restaurant was full, so we sat at the bar area. It worked for my group of 5, but I wouldn't recommend it for bigger parties. Beautiful view of the shopping center fountain. We were greeted straight away. Once the bottomless mimosas were ordered our glasses were never empty. They give you a baby jug of OJ and refill your glass with just champagne. The mimosas were $16.99, but with brunch from 9am to 3pm you can definitely get your fill.   The avocado toast was amazing! I only wish it was bigger. My deconstructed salmon bagel was awesome. I was surprised by how much fish they gave me. When we mentioned it was Bub's birthday they brought him an ice cream cake dessert. I was a little buzzed by then so I don't remember exactly what it was, just that it was good.  Don't forget to check out the bathroom! Hand salt that makes your skin feel baby smooth.",

    "text": "Meat eaters rejoice! Besides the excellent cuts of meat, the customer service is superb! They will explain everything you need to know to chose the best entree. I chose the Rib Eye Cap, medium with the braised mushrooms. It was fantastic. No salt, pepper, or A1 needed. It was perfection.  It came with garlic chips, and stuffed mushroom; the chips can be dipped in the braised mushroom sauce for an extra boost flavor, the mushrooms were nothing special but also tasty. The Rib Eye was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The sides were also delicious. I chose mashed potatoes(two portions), brussels sprouts with pistachios,  porta bella mushroom fries (two portions), seven cheese mac and cheese, the cauliflower and pork belly. The pork belly, porta bella mushroom fries and the seven cheese Mac and cheese are a must!! The sides were enough for six people and the Rib Eye was enough to share with my spouse. Prices are very reasonable considering the quality of food and customer service. It is a few minutes drive off the strip but well worth it ( we did find when our Uber driver took the streets and not the freeway we arrived much faster). I will definitely make this a stop on my Vegas trips!",

    "text": "Located in a beautiful Tivoli Village (about a 30 minute drive off strip or 8 miles) Echo and Rig fit right in with ambience and decor. The staff was amazing! We were running behind and 1/2 hour late on our reservation but still received a smile from the front hostess and we were sat within 10 minutes. Drinks were prepared perfectly. He had Raspberry Mojito.  I had smoked respardo(?) Thyme. That's a sipping drink,  no doubt! I liked the smoky herbal taste. Not for everyone.   The waiter was very knowledgeable and we really liked his demeanor. Very good server. They offer complimentary distilled sparkling water which is a plus for me.  Menu was a good size. Main focus is on the proteins, with sides and such being your choice with an added cost of. $6 and up.  We got: Portabella fries....perfectly cooked, and thick cut w the lightest coating. My husband ate these up quick!  Watermelon salad with heirloom tomato cucumber and red onion. This was good and fresh,  with just the right amount of dressing. Red onions sliced a bit too thick. .. they need to be almost shaved to enjoy raw. Very overpowering so we left several slices lingering in the bottom.  We split the Ribeye Cap. Cooked perfectly but a tad salty for me when used with the bleu cheese sauce.  We did like the red oak grilled taste. We could have eaten a bigger steak but had a big lunch so this was ok. This came with one stuffed button mushroom and fresh potato chips...so we also got... Butternut squash with pepitas and some kind of white cheese. This was earthly and good to me but my husband would have preferred something else.  We received complimentary wedding champagne and sorbet with fruit from the manager. A very nice surprise. Thank You.  Overall,  if I lived in the area,  I would come back,  try other menu items, (but of course get those portabella fries hahaha) and ask for light seasoning on my steak. This place is a winner.",

Had a cocktail, \"Goldigger\" it has a \"peat mist\", not really a peaty whiskey in it but it was good to try once. For an appetizer we had potato pancakes, my wife said they were a little cold in the middle. They were a little bland but not bad. I ordered the salmon with poached eggs on a potato pancake. Salmon was fresh, the pancakes really were cold in the middle and the eggs were hard. Not poached well at all. The manager was very nice and she checked on us.  I received new eggs after a few. They were not that busy, but our server really didn't come by to check on my food or ask what happened. Maybe we r spoiled, sorry no pics as my wife didn't finish her short rib hash, it was ok. About $30 a person btw",

My date informed me we could bring our own wine, which blew my mind, cause what? That's a thing!? (And Total Wine is like right up the street!)   Our reservation was pretty last minute and they were flexible with us pushing it back even later. Service was great. The hostess was sweet, our server was very attentive and personable without lingering or being overbearing, and the manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking as well.  We started out with a caesar salad. Nothing particularly special, but honestly, I just enjoy a nice, fresh salad. The surprise came in the form of the pork belly burnt ends. My goodness, they were good. So good. Like, let me eat this for the rest of my days good. For our main dishes, my date had the skirt steak while I had the Spencer. Both were cooked perfectly, with him opting for their blue cheese sauce and me sticking with the red wine.  Overall, it was a great dinner, and definitely worth the trip across town.",

    "text": "We just watched a movie and was ready for \"lunch\" we made our way home and passed Trivoli village and thought of echo & rig's. We hadn't been in a while so we decided to stop.   We road the elevator instead of doing the stairs, both my husband and I have bad knees, the hosted left us at the elevator and said she would meet us at the top?  Last time the hosted road with us! Felt abandoned.   Then we walked through a very busy restaurant, straight to the out door seating area, corner table next to the railing. Next to one of those space heaters. I am warm bloody and chose to sit as far from it as possible. Bad decision, wind coming across that corner was too much for me, had to change seats, a little better but still windy.   After a good 20 minutes, a server finally acknowledged we where in his section and took our drink orders. Then it took another 20 minutes to get them. After what seemed like another 30 minutes, our server came back to take our food order.   Now on Sundays they have a 'brunch' menu with limited items, mostly breakfast things, by this time it's after 230pm, we got there at 120pm. They offer unlimited mimosas for $16 and unlimited bloody Mary's for $22.   We are not much for drinking, tea and coffee is our usual and occasionally a cocktail.   We ordered a couple of things for appetizers, we had a small plate, crab cake and the goat cheese sandwich, the drunken goat. Red wine marinated goat cheese Brie, cranberry chutney, herbs de province green apple, petite greens, aioli and walnut bread.   I really liked this combination, loved the walnut bread, it was toasted and three layers. Loved the goat cheese. The whole thing was really good. It's a really big sandwich enough for two to split.   The Maryland crab cake was also very tasty with big chunks of crab with red pepper coulis and lime. This was a 'small' plate and you should expect that, small taste for two, for one person it would be just right.   For main courses my husband got the Summertime Steakhouse salad. It's a natural USDA primeflat iron steak with red onion, mango, avocado, basilromaine & white balsamic-lime vinaigrette. Very good size but only three small strips of steak. It was cooked to order, my husband said he was satisfied, so I guess it was the right amount.   I got the Flat Iron USDA Prime steak, roasted anaheim chilies spinach & preserved lemon chimichurri. It was on a baguette and came with home made potato chips.  First bite and I ended up using a knife and fork to eat it, steak was tender, cooked to order, but big pieces and not able to take smaller bites, so I just cut it up.   Our food was good, our service on the other hand was a disappointment. Seemed very slow and we where still eating our apps when our main entree's came. Then getting refills also took some time as well.  We've been before when it was not so busy and service was great, so not sure if it's the time of day we came this time or that's the new norm. We're sure to return, just hope service is better.",

The bar area is small, and where we decided to enjoy our afternoon. The steak and egg is $1.99!!! We ordered a double steak and egg and they had no issues with that at all! My issue however was the under cooked egg; of the 4 of us, all of them were under. Even another customer at the end of the bar returned his to get recooked. With the undercooked egg and the over cooked steak I was thankful the steak was still tender and full of flavor!   The butcher shop next to the bar was a welcomed sight! They had a beautiful case of meats to choose from. They even offer bone broth and bones for doggies! All the meat looked great and the next time I'm going straight home from there I will make a purchase.   Looking forward to our next happy hour at Echo & Rig!",

    "text": "My mom and I had dinner here recently and really enjoyed it.  I had heard good things about it and wanted to try it.  We had a 630pm reservation and had to wait a few minutes for our table.  The restaurant is two stories with the bar and hostess station on the first floor, along with a butcher shop where you can buy meat.  The 2nd story is where the kitchen and all the tables are.  We had a nice table over looking most of the restaurant.  Our servers were great.  Coming by often and being attentive.   I had a Summer special peach mule for my drink.  It was really tasty.  Nice peach vodka and tart ginger beer.  For starters, mom had the Onion Soup Gratinee - gruyere, pumpkin squash, sage. She really liked this.  Not a large portion as onion soup normally is.  A good starter size.  Nice sweet onions.  I had the Avocado Toast, Macerated Baby Tomatoes & Burrata. Really tasty.  Nice mild avocado and burrata.    For entrees, I had the Jumping Beef - filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes & Peruvian demi-glace.  Tender beef with a spicy sauce, good veggies.  Mom had the Salt & Pepper Pork Chop - Fuji apple, slow-cooked beet greens, calvados demi-glace.  She really liked the pork.  Nice flavor, well cooked.  She took half of it home as it was big piece.  The apple was sweet and tender.  For dessert, we split scoops of peach and grapefruit sorbet with fresh berries on top.  This was the perfect portion size to share.  Nice light sorbet flavors, fresh favorable berries on top.  Overall a really nice dinner, great food, good service.  A nice local place away from the strip.",

    "text": "Echo & rigs is such a popular place for Las Vegas locals.  We've been there numerous times and by far, our last visit was our worse experience ever.    We took our out of town guests for Sunday brunch, we wanted to impress them with this local gem provides no gimmicks just good food and service.  However, echo & rigs didn't do any justice.  We had a party of 9 people, we were running 30 mins late because we had 2 toddlers with us.  We called them and they were nice about it.  We arrived but we still waited about 30 mins to get sit.    Everybody was famished.  We ordered right away.  After our server took our order, he was no where to be found during our whole meal.  We had no water on the table.  We were missing utensils.  Our toddlers were hungry because they didn't like the food.  We couldn't add more orders.  It was a mess. There was no one to help us.  This place charged 18% gratuity for big party automatically, the server was doing the minimal because he knew his cut was safe.    We were fed up with the negligence, finally we waved like crazy to get someone's attention and the manager came over, and we told him about our situation.  The waiter came immediately and helped us.  He did apologize.  It didn't help much with our frustration even thou he was trying to charm us with his big gorgeous smile.  Too little too late.   The food was horrible.  The short ribs has was oily and mush and egg benedict was over and english muffin was chewy and old.  The portobello fries and avo toast were the only food up to standard.  I was literally embarrassed in front of my friends.  Because Las Vegas local restaurants have so much more to offer, just not Echo & rigs.  Btw, the menu were not kids friendly.  The brunch menu was limited and not versatile.  They have no regular pancakes, so  we ordered plain bread for my kid, 2 sliced of wheat toast arrived, seriously?  End up our toddlers were hungry and grumpy.  And we were frustrated and angry.    I will not recommend anyone to this place.",

Literally chopped veggies, cold, with a light dressing. Very good!  Tried the crab cake, it was decent. I was trying to get as close to surf and turf as possible. The homemade chips are great! Side of broccoli was decent and mashed potatoes were pretty good.  This place is pretty fancy but the staff is gracious, knowledgeable, and helpful. I had 3 people come assist me when I was looking for the bathroom! Pricey but worth every penny.",

My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and I ordered the Melon-Coly Misfit cocktail. Wow, what a combination of ingredients to create such a smooth delicious drink. Next, we ordered the Short Rib Hash and the Quiche. The hash had such amazing flavors. My quiche came out cold so I immediately told my waitress and it was replaced quickly. The quiche was so amazing. I simply love anything with goat cheese and this quiche had it. The portion size was good too. The salad it came with was perfect and light. Our waitress Rae was so friendly and attentive. She didn't hesitate at all to replace it. She kept apologizing and had a smile the entire time. Overall, this place was excellent. I will be returning.",

Avocado toast was on a rustic long bread.  The hamburger was a sturdy piece of protein and pleasant char. Not oily. The crispy home style potato chips were crispy-good.

    "text": "The food was good, but the service was the stand out performance of the night. The staff checks in frequently and when our drinks were down to 1/3, they brought a refill.  Small plates: Brussel sprouts - sauteed in butter. Good flavor but defeats the whole \"eat them because they're healthy\" rationale. Good for sharing   Pork burnt ends - served in a caramelized sauce that seemed to be similar to the Chinese bbq pork flavor. 8 slices on our order, good for sharing   Octopus salad - tremendous flavor in the dressing and the octopus (smoked?). My preference would have been for the octopus to be a bit softer in texture but was still a nice dish. Good for sharing   Crab cake - was good but my portion (we split it) didn't have a a lot of crab while others did. Good for sharing but it's not something I think I'd order from here again, not because of the crab portion but because it's average as far as crab cakes go  Fries - standard fries. Not much to say here  Entrees: Lamb porterhouse - was very good. Smoked flavor and meat wasn't gamey at all. Served with small potatoes  47(?) oz tomahawk - meat was very tender and had good marbling. Some parts came a bit too charred for my liking, but that didn't impact the medium rare at all. You can ask the chef to cut it for you for sharing purposes. Comes with 4-5 sauces for you to choose from, we didn't really like/need any. Salt to flavor ftw",

Normally, I feel the need to keep checking with the hostess to make sure they haven't forgotten about us, but at Echo & Rig, the hostess was on it and kept us informed.  Brownie points for that.  After getting seated, our waiter seemed a bit rushed and annoyed that we weren't ready to order.  He spoke really fast.  I think he warmed up to us by the end of the meal though.  Now onto the food.  It was perfect!  The roasted chicken I had was so moist, breast meat too.  I was concerned about the black beans under it because I don't like beans, but it was cooked with the chicken juices and just enhanced the flavor of the chicken.  All the steaks at our table were done to perfection as well.  For sides, we had brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, roasted broccollini, and portobello mushroom fries.  You can't go wrong with any of these options.  For kids, they made us a simple cheeseburger with fries that got devoured.  All in all, it was an amazing experience.  Oh and how could I forget the dessert.  A pink grapefruit sorbet and a berries sundae.  The cake in the berry sundae was dry and crumbly, but that's my only complaint for the entire meal.  I'll definitely be back.",

You can't come here with starting up the ENDLESS mimosas, which are just that! ENDLESS. The servers make sure to make their rounds and to top the glass off when needed and also refilled the orange juice.   Now when it comes to the food? There isn't a bad choice at all! From the salmon bagel w/ capers, delectable French toast or the Maryland inspired crab cake.  The salmon bagel itself was amazing, well prepared, and presentation alone was nice. The French toast was delicious, sweet, and will always be a breakfast classic that no one should pass on. The crab cake was a special plate for me simply because I'm from the east coast where seafood is king and these guys knocked it out of the park from taste, appearance, delivery and smells.     I implore anyone on the fence about this place or anyone looking to try something new to give this restaurant the opportunity it deserves! You truly will not be let down or disappointed!",

The restaurant is at Tivoli Village and it's so much bigger than I had thought it would be. I had no idea there was two stories and a lovely patio/balcony. We arrived and were brought up the stairs by the most friendly host to our table outside. In fact, every single person who came to our table was very welcoming and kind. I've never experienced such amazing staff at a restaurant.   We decided to opt out of small plates and salads, aside from the shrimp. My husband ordered 4 shrimp not realizing they were HUGE and $4 a piece. Luckily, they were worth it and super good. I ordered the drunken goat sandwich along with fries and my husband got a steak that came with chips and a stuffed mushroom cap. First, the sandwich was ginormous which made me glad we didn't get appetizers. Second, it was the most amazing sandwich ever, I loved all the flavors from the sweetness from the cranberry and apple to the savory creaminess of the cheese. The fries were so good, I ate them all. My husbands steak was cooked perfectly and the chips were so good as well.   To finish off I ordered the cappuccino sundae. It wasn't overly sweet and you could definitely taste the coffee in it. It was very good but too big for one person.   Such a great restaurant!",

    "text": "I must say, one of the best steaks I've ever eaten! That says a lot especially when I've eaten at many high end steakhouses throughout my Yelp years.   Best local secret in Las Vegas (in Summerlin to be exact). After a round of golf nearby, my local LV BFF made reservations for us at Echo and Rig.   We ordered the delicious Steak Tartar (must order), fried Portobello mushrooms, shrimp cocktail (it was okay), cauliflower, kale salad for the group. You must order the Steak Tartar with sour dough. It's the greatest!  :)  After the appetizers, our waitress brought out large tray of the tomahawk steaks for size comparison (I think there were 5-6 cuts).  I think we ordered the 2nd larger cut...48 oz and shared it with 3 out of the 4 in our party. The tomahawk was flashed charred and medium rare inside. It was cooked to perfection!!! Like I said before, the steak was perfect, it was soft and perfectly seasoned. Echo & Rig also has 7-8 side sauces that accompanied the tomahawk and if I remember, the mushroom sauce was one of my favorites.   Echo & Rig was casual (I still had on my golf gear, polo and shorts) and didn't have a problem dining in. Butcher on-site. Raw oyster bar in-house as well.   I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas. Reservations recommended. It was packed!",

    "text": "I don't think a visit to the Vegas area is complete without dinner here. Forget the steakhouses on the Strip and their bloated prices and drive 20-25 minutes east. I've never had any trouble getting a reservation for an early dinner, but it can get pretty busy on weekends. The staff here is friendly and attentive. As some one that drinks a lot of water, I've never had to ask for a refill here-- it just comes and I love that.   Here's what I've tried:  Butcher Blend Burger - Super juicy and delicious. Well-priced too. The brioche bun does its job and sops up all that burger goodness without it getting on your hands. Do yourself a favor and get it with cheddar.   Cauliflower - Really good textures. Great char, a little crunch, and a spicy kick if you want it.   Mashed Potatoes - Just what you asked for. Creamy, salty, delicious.   Portobello Fries - I order this every time. Their lightly breaded and fried. The aioli is so tasty.   Bone Marrow Carne Asada - If bone marrow is on the menu I won't not try it at least once. I'll be honest-- it's average here and the carne asada doesn't do much for the taste.   The steaks here are really good and incredibly well-priced. As I mentioned earlier, you're not paying the premiums you would if you were to eat on the Strip. In terms of sauces I like the Charred Onion one. It lends a nice tang and subtle char. What I love about the steaks is that the wood they cook them over impart a little bit flavor. The garlic chips are also addicting!  Ribeye - The portion sizes aren't posted on the menu but I recall that the ribeyes here are on the larger end, around 10-12 oz. The steaks here are very good, and you can't go wrong with the ribeye. I've never had to send a steak back.   Ribeye Cap - My preferred cut here. It's the best part of the ribeye! It normally comes around 8oz., and is the type of thing I'll eat slowly to savor.  Every visit I'll order a steak and a couple of sides. The bang for your buck here is unmatched. There's a reason why it's normally filled with locals. Parking here is readily available if you get in early enough.",

The food was outstanding; we ordered Tomahawk steak; butterfish & shrimp w/ artichoke, which were all delicious and mesmerizing!

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE everything about this place, from the food to the service. This place is definitely all about meat but I loved the combination of an upscale restaurant with a butcher shop downstairs.   Importantly, it's BYOB!!! From what I heard, it's usually a bottle of wine per four people. Our waiter was kind enough to allow us to have several bottles open throughout the night. In addition, we were a party of nine and we were ordering so many items and couldn't order the charcuterie board because we thought it would be too much food. However, the waiter brought us out two boards to share on him!   Another thing that I liked about E&R was the person who helped us at the butcher shop(Aaron?). I was picking up some items to make dinner for the following night and he was incredibly helpful!   Overall, really great place. I didn't get to try any of the steaks because I was having it the next day. But my favorite items were the duck and portabella fries! Definitely coming back to have their steak next time!",

The restaurant is just so beautiful...this place is really amazing.  I've been here for dinner and for brunch - both are spectacular. My first Echo & Rig experience was dinner - my husband and I came to celebrate our anniversary and they made it really special for us. Champagne upon seating and the salted caramel sundae after dinner were really nice touches! Our server explained the menu in detail and brought out the different cuts of meat for the day so we could choose. We started with a caesar salad which was fresh and delicious, and for our entree, we ended up doing a tomahawk ribeye for two with roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar (on the side was this mushroom gravy...it was the most delicious gravy I've ever tasted), and macaroni and cheese. Easily the best dinner I've ever had in Las Vegas! They have an awesome wine list and we had a malbec - delicious and the perfect complement to dinner. The staff that helped us was awesome and couldn't have been more accommodating - Nicholas, Jared, and Jay M., you guys rock and made our anniversary so special. We just moved and didn't want to do a big trip for our anniversary so we kept it low-key...to have such awesome service, food, and wine made it a really unforgettable night.  Since then, I've enjoyed brunch once at Echo & Rig and it was also amazing. I went with friends and we sat outside to enjoy a beautiful day - their balcony is so beautiful. My friends had breakfast and I chose lunch - I had the grilled cheese with short ribs, gruyere, white cheddar & parmesan. It was THE BEST grilled cheese ever! If you're feeling something super indulgent, get that. I can't remember our server's name, but Beth, the manager came out to say hi and she was amazing.   I can't wait to come back to Echo & Rig. Definitely recommend for brunch, dinner, date night, or a special occasion...whatever it is, they will make it memorable.",

Don't come here if you are looking for a nice thick juicy steak",

    "text": "another great visit. went for drinks and bites late afternoon/early evening. small group of us, so we were able to try a quite a few different plates  portabella mushroom plate always great. the butterfish was a hit as well. flat iron steak a good inexpensive choice, nice recommendation by waiter. asparagus and egg....funny but worked. mac and cheese, can't go wrong. bacon plate, again good, not spectacular (in lieu of missing pork belly). watermelon salad was nice and refreshing and the butternut ravioli was nice too  only slight miss would have been octopus salad, would probably pass on next time didn't really care for the devils chicken either (in lieu of duck....boo!)  for dessert, we had the berry shortcake, good, but not outstanding salted caramel sundae......this was a hit....not sure if we liked better than the dark chocolate cherry, but next time we will do both for side by side comparison!  One drawback, I know we went on a Monday, but they seemed to be out of a few dishes again. missed out on the duck confit, which we were dying to try and the pork belly, which the waiter recommended only to come back to tell us they were out of  think it would be nicer if the wait staff were fully prepped as to the items on the menu which would be unavailable that day. we went around 5pm, so its not like they just ran out. would have saved us from a few disappointments  in any case, a nice visit again, this place is definitely on out fav list!",

It was quite busy but we had a reservation and were seated promptly. Immediately, the manager came and introduced us to our waitress, Kendra. There was plenty of staff to meet the demands of a busy evening. We never wanted for anything. They took such good care of us. I had the filet and my husband ordered a burger. Our food was amazing. We decided to have the turtle sundae for dessert because, well, it's Valentine's Day and why not!? It was delicious and just the right amount to share. We will be back each and every time we are back in town. This place is the real deal.",

Next time we will take advantage of the no corkage fees for wine you bring in, along with an entree. The service was quick and handled very prifessionally.

    "text": "The highlight of this place is, without a doubt, that they serve grass-fed steaks at legit prices! I ordered the hanger steak and the wife had the Spencer steak. Both were absolutely excellent. They were cooked and seasoned almost perfectly. The atmosphere is great, the staff is great, the bar downstairs has a great sangria. Overall, I think it's my new go-to steakhouse. The prices for the quality of food you're getting is just amazing.  Aside from our main dishes, we had the mashed potatoes and the asparagus with fried egg. Both were also amazingly delicious. One of the waiters came by and asked out of curiosity why I'd ordered the asparagus and I had to admit it was a legit question. Not usually two things that I ever would have thought to put together. My answer to him was, \"Well, I like eggs and I like asparagus, so I figured I couldn't lose.\"  I was right. It's a combination I never would have thought of that goes together very well. The sauce on the plate is also delicious, and the flavors all just go together.  They brought out bread while we waited for our appetizers, which I usually don't eat. I made an exception this time and ended up eating all four pieces. It was very very good, and apparently very high quality because I didn't feel terrible after eating it. I have found that the higher the quality of ingredients in a few foods I avoid -- like bread, for example -- the less terrible I will feel. I still shouldn't have eaten it and felt the effects later, but I don't regret it. The bread was delicious and was high quality.  There are three things that I was not too happy with during the meal. One, I ordered the bone marrow appetizer and the waiter came back about 10 minutes later to tell me that they were all out of bone marrow. I wish he would have known that when I ordered it, and I wish they wouldn't have run out! Not a big deal, since this is what made me order the asparagus and egg which ended up being delicious also. Two, the hanger steak was cut incorrectly. A steak like this needs to be cut across the grain of the meat, otherwise the fibers in the pieces are very long and it makes the steak chewy. Thankfully, the steak was cut in such a way that as I made the pieces smaller I was able to cut them across the grain myself and the steak was definitely cooked just right so it was perfect when properly cut. Third, and this was the case for both my and my wife's steak, the char on the outside was a bit heavy on the ends. Two small bites of each steak on the ends was very charcoal-like, with that sandy texture and bitter taste. It doesn't extend too far into the meat so you're just losing the nice seared exterior of these two very small parts of the meat, and I ate them anyway. Just something that I'd like to see them be more watchful of.  This place is definitely a 5-star-worthy steak house, and if you're trying to eat Paleo you can  just chow down on grass-fed steak and a bunch of Paleo-friendly appetizers and have a great night out.  Pro tip: a Spencer steak is s boneless ribeye; also called a Delmonico steak in some places, but really it's just a ribeye. The Spencer steak here is ~$10 cheaper than the bone-in ribeye. You get the same great cut of meat and more for your money by weight, but you miss out a bit on the little something extra of flavor that the bone imparts.",

The staff was great, the steaks were delicious and prepared perfectly, the salads and sides were delicious.  The only issue we had was, while waiting for a table, the bar staff was struggling to keep up and we got our cocktails 14:59 minutes into a 15 minute wail for a table.  Talking to some of the other staff, we found out that one of the bartenders was \"the new girl\" they were trying to train.  Other than that, the experience was perfect and one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.",

    "text": "I too was with the Katelyn E. dinner party on May 21, 2016 for my daughters birthday (her sister) My oldest daughter had never been to Echo & Rig before but had heard us talk so highly of this restaurant she wanted to go for her birthday and we wanted something special for her.  Please note that our food and waiter were both great during the last two experiences.  Our issue is with the having a reservation or not having a reservation.  Recently about month ago we decided to try the brunch menu on a Sunday.  When we arrived we were told that they were full and we should of made a reservation.  We were disappointed but thought oh well next time we know better.  We did end up eating down in the bar area instead (not quite the experience as up stairs) and settled for that instead.  Few minutes later another group sat next to us and they did not have a reservations as well and but decided to make the best of the bar area too.  As we all received our drinks and looking over the menus the hostess came over to the other group and offered them a table upstairs.  NOT COOL!   My daughter and I decided that this may have just been an oversight and a restaurant of this scale would not do that under normal circumstances.  Ok we forgave you that one time!  Now on to our experience on May 21st.  So we made sure we made reservations early so we would get seated in the area we wanted to be which was the patio.  So as you have read in the my daughters review: They made us wait downstairs for 45 minutes and then took us upstairs never telling us that they were planning on seating us inside.  The hostess looked puzzled and called the manager over.  He then explained that he was only doing it temporally until the table was available.  He didn't want us waiting downstairs any longer. He took me over to where he wanted to seat us and told me as soon as they were open he would seat us.  What good is a reservation if you are not seated at the time of the reservation!!   Finally another 15 minutes goes by and they finally come to seat us outside, its not the table he showed me and is at the opposite end of the patio with NO view of the city lights.  I did not notice anyone with prom attire and when we walked by the table he showed me earlier there was a new set of guest seated there. By now we are all starving!  Derek, the manager, said he would make it up to us.  We received 3 salads comped - whoopee - I think he could of done much better than that.  : (      I think we got the message from Echo & Rig. Its too bad, the food and waitstaff are great.   ps.  the men and women bathrooms were filthy - my husband told them about the men's room and they never took care of it.  We were there for over 3 1/2 hours and notice the women's restrooms need attention as well with paper towels on the floor, etc. For this upscale of a restaurant they should know better.",

You have to check it out, ladies ;)  I had a great experience dining here with a group for a bday, and I will definitely return to try different steaks, and that fried chicken salad...

But, the other cuts of times past and new renditions of popular side excites my want-to-be foodie palate. We ordered the portobello fries (neat to try but wouldn't get again), fried spinach salad (even though the main component is fried and I generally don't order salads with fried chicken etc...this salad is unique and the dressing and texture of the spinach leaves this salad front of mind), garlic mashed (great garlic flavor) and the Ribeye-Cap cut and the Spencer steak (eye of the ribeye and apparently my Grandfather's favorite cut). The steaks are cooked to your expected temperature and unlike most other steakhouses that charge extra to keep your steak company on the plate, Echo & Rig offers house made chips, a stuffed mushroom and choice of five sauces.  I will definitely be back, their HH looks promising as does their cocktail list.",

Fried spinach Octopus salad Portable lo fries...the best Thick cut bacon Cauliflower with chili Roasted broccoli I  These were all great well seasoned and presented.  I actually got too into the eating to take pics but there are enough on here anyway. Entrees Ribeye cap Jumping beef Duck breast  The only hit I'm  going to give them is the duck breast was a touch overdone and the skin could have been rendered a bit more to make it crispy.  My wife said it was ok and didn't want to send it back.  The Ribeye cap was perfectly cooked with just the right am ou nt of char on the sear. Service was excellent and very attentive without being overbearing. They even threw in a dessert since we were there for my birthday. On the way out we stopped at the butcher shop downstairs and picked up some charcuterie. Lardo Pate de Camagne Liver pate Cote Chino And a lamb ham Had a little taste of each when we got home and they were excellent.  Will be going back there too.",

Our party of 7 had 4 newbies to the restaurant, and, to no surprise, E&R lived up to the hype that we discussed.  We had two sets of appetizers for the table, including: - portobello fries (with an incredible aioli) - roasted cauliflower (perfect blend of heat and breading)  I also ordered the Blood and Bourbon, a great cocktail to start off the dinner. For the main entree, most of us had the rib eye cap. A unique cut, the steak basically melted in your mouth.  There aren't too many steaks that match up with E&R's cap.   Echo & Rig has become a staple every time we come to Vegas now. The service is top notch - thanks to Xavier, Brian, Frank and crew!",

I choose the Mojito. Refreshing, strong in a good way and it complimented the Octopus I ordered with steak tartar. Get the portobello fries, it's a must. We ordered and split the 12oz bone in rib eye which was amazing with 3 sides of sauces. My favorite was either the onion or bernaise. Hopefully I spelled that right. The valet was weak... But he was the only one parking cars. So that is my only critical feedback. Prices was under 110 for two w/ 2 drinks! Amazeballs!",

The food: everything was delicious but we ended up over-ordering and were pretty full by the time the actual entrees came around.  We ordered:  Mac & Cheese Grilled Thick-Cut Bacon & Barbecue Sauce Pork Belly, White Grits & Apple Cider Sauce Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli  The portobello fries and the pork belly was my favorite.   For the steak entrees, most of of ordered the Rib Eye Cap or the Spencer Steak. It was delicious like I said but it was too much food. We struggled to eat everything.   Next time around, order one appetizer per two people, no matter how good your server is at their job of convincing you to order more. Wait and order more after.   It did take a while for our steaks to come out, but the end result was so worth it.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. The concept is fantastic, the design is clean, and the menu sounds absolutely amazing on paper.   It's important to note that service was exceptional and attentive. The servers, bussers, and managers do a great job to make sure everyone is well taken care of, and that is evidenced by the very large numbers of very obvious regular and return customers.   Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed by the steaks, and surprised by how expensive the off-menu specialty cuts were. To be clear, if you order from the menu, I think the prices are as fair as it gets for a nice steak restaurant in Las Vegas. But we paid $117 for a Tomahawk Ribeye and $77 for a T-Bone. That's Las Vegas Strip expensive, and more expensive than all but 1 steakhouse I've visited anywhere in the country. Had we been on the strip, I would have had no problem paying those prices...but not in Summerlin.   The biggest concern we had was that both steaks seemed entirely unseasoned, like someone pulled them out of the cooler and put them straight on the grill with nothing on them. Some purists say this is the right way to cook a steak, but every steakhouse I've visited at least salts the meat, and that is what the American palate has come to expect.   Of less concern was the fact that both of these monster steaks were undercooked. T-Bone ordered medium and was delivered medium rare at best. Tomahawk ordered medium rare and varied from rare to blue in the center.   Side dishes were mostly tasty - some hits, some misses, but all perfectly acceptable.   Based on my experience, I'd say the 4.5 star average on yelp seems a bit generous. Echo and Rig isn't bad, but it's not 4.5 stars good.",

He made sure our first visit was a great one in all aspects. Jessie is the reason 5 starts was in order. The food thick cut bacon with BBQ sauce  Tomahawk steak, mashed potatoes with white cheese (for him)  baked sweet potato (mine) homemade garlic chips and mushroom and the many different sauces a glass of moet for me and red wine for him was excellent!

Cauliflower small plate was great, but Brussels Sprouts not so great--lots of leaves, very little flavor. Filet was great, but Spencer steak not so great--large piece, perfectly done, but not at all tender or easy to cut or chew. Salmon was great (except for bland rice that came with), but Shrimp and Artichokes was nearly inedible--very heavy, overwhelming sauce. I'd probably go again for dinner sometime, but I'd be hoping for more hits and fewer misses. P.S. the hostess who seated us asked us if we were there for a special occasion, and we said we were celebrating a birthday, but that was the last we heard about that. Made me wonder why she asked.",

Everything is made from scratch, which makes everything from sausage to designer cocktails amazeballs great. We had the Rib Eye Cap steak... taken from the most tender part of the rib eye area (I'm not a meat expert! But they are). It was seriously the best steak we've ever eaten, and at $22, are you KIDDING ME? They had a choice of 8 sauces, but none tasted as good as the naked steak. Also amazing was the lighter-than-air \"Over The Rainbow\" chopped salad (quinoa, citrus, veggies in a champagne vinaigrette dressing), $8. And the crispy fried portobello fries with aioli dip was a knockout, don't miss them whatever you do.    We bought an awesome roast and some amazing breakfast sausage (made that morning!) at the butcher shop downstairs, on the way out. Meat so awesomely fresh that they can tell you the story of each kind of meat... where the cow came from, how it was raised, how it lived (on the farm, grazing naturally), no hormones no preservatives, none of that. And super reasonably priced, just like our meal was upstairs. We'll be back, just for the butcher shop.    Sorry to run off at the mouth, but Echo & Rig should NOT be missed.    Great service, too... intuitive but not interruptive. Ask for Patrick!",

When deciding where to have it, we went and talked to the manager, Cheryl and the head chef Sam.  They made us feel so comfortable there and felt good having 17 of our friends and family join us.  Let me start with the food....amazing!  Their appetizers were really different from other places and I can't even describe how good it was.  My steak came out a bit too cooked and they immediately took it back and with minutes had a perfectly cooked steak in front of me.  The steaks were superb and melted in your mouth.  Now for the customer service....if this rating had 10 stars, this would be 10 star status.  Ricky, our waiter and his crew were on everything!  We had a group of people behind us that were a bit loud, without even mentioning it to Ricky, he brought us out some horderves for the inconvenience that were out of this world.   Hands down, the best restaurant I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!  BEST DINING EXPERIENCE.  We will drive to Vegas just to dine at ECHO & RIG!

    "text": "I heard about this restaurant from a woman at work.  When I called to make a reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion ...i told them it was my birthday.  When we showed up for our reservation we ended up having to wait for almost 20 minutes for our table.  When we were seated we sat for a good while until we were approached. In fact the general manager had come over to see how we were doing because a server had not approached our table.  I ordered bacon and eggs and a bagel.  My sister ordered the same and my friend ordered the steak and egg bowl.  We all ordered the bottomless mimosas and my sister and i ordered coffee.  To get someone to refill our coffee and mimosas was like pulling teeth.  The eggs are \"any style\" yet they don't do basted eggs...so  really no they aren't any style.  I was really blown away by the bacon.  We had looked at all the meat in the fridge before we came up and I was excited to taste the glorious looking bacon.  When I got my plate I had a twisted up mess of 4 pieces of overly burnt bacon.  There was absolutely no moisture in this bacon... none. dead... so confusing how this is a butcher shop yet the cooks can't cook their meat.  The server had forgot my potatoes but finally after I mentioned it... he brought them out.  I wasn't too fond of them either... although they did have a mixture of peppers and onions... the potatoes clearly tasted like they had been deep fried.. just not the way breakfast or \"brunch\" potatoes should be cooked...definitely not in a place like that... the server brought out the dessert menu and I mentioned that when I called for my reservation they told me since it was my birthday to \"prepare\" for a sundae! yay! so a gentleman walked over... dressed in a suit so I assume he was a different manager... he told me he would take care of it and brought me out an amazing sundae off their dessert menu... that was one of the only high points of this restaurant.  I probably won't ever go back considering the price I paid for less than mediocre bacon and eggs.",

    "text": "To sum it up: great food, but worst service in town for the cost. Will not return.  I almost feel bad for the skilled chefs working so hard in the back, only to have the front of the house destroy it. First impression walking in was great. Dry aged meats hanging everywhere while a butcher chops away at carcasses.   We were told seating will only be a matter of minutes, but after hearing that many times, an hour went by before finally seated. When the waiter introduced himself, he also introduced the long list of steaks that we could NOT order. Really?? How are they out of steaks?! Anyway, this carnivore will not be stopped, so luckily I had a variety of interesting body parts to choose from. I have no problem raving about he food. When available, everything tastes amazing. BUT the wait staff completely overshadowed it with horribly slow service, arguing in front of the table, and just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, vinaigrette was dumped all over the back of my friend. A manager came by and told him, \"oh, it doesn't look too bad?\" Umm, that's because we've already scrubbed him down with napkins. He offered to pay for dry cleaning...which was a nice try, but what do they expect him to take his shirt off, or worse yet, come back to pick up dry cleaning money? Look, damage is done, comp his meal at least. In the end, we just couldn't wait to leave. We arrived at 6:30, seated at 7:30, got our meals well after 9, and still couldn't get out before 10pm. After requesting a check many times, they brought out complimentary desserts (which again, the food was great) but at that point, a bandaid can't patch up a severed limb. Too little too late, let's just put this one behind us.  Good thing I had excellent company to experience this with...great trials make great stories!",

Our server Austin and his assistant provided outstanding service. The manager visited our table to say hello and referred to us by name -- very classy. Among the items we ordered were Caesar salad -- served not chopped, but whole leaves on the plate dressed very nicely. Seemed like there was a whole head of romaine on the plate. It was fresh and tasty. A warm baguette and butter was served. There are cuts of meat offered on the menu and our server also came with a tray of bone-in cuts. We chose the bone-in 27 oz. NY strip to share. Cost was $2.49 per ounce or $68 for the steak. They offered to serve it sliced as it's easier for the kitchen to slice it than for the diner to do it at the table. So we took them up on that suggestion. Ordered medium rare and grilled over wood it had very nice flavor. Sides of sweet potato and broccolini (with a tad of red pepper) were good. Steak was also served with large potato chips. Forget the special cocktail we ordered, it was very good. Dessert was a cherry sundae with semi-sweet chocolate ice cream and was also very good. Only reason I did not give a five star review was the steak. It was tasty, but had some tough areas and just not as good as similar steaks we've had at other restaurants. Yes, we will go back next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I had my parents and their friends in town from Los Angeles. I told them about this great restaurant and took them here. I was furious at my server that day.  This was on the 7th of November and we had a 5:15pm reservation. The manager came and greeted us and introduced the staff and our server.  Our main server who took our initial order never came back to see us after we ordered our food.  We only saw the other servers assigned to our table.  What angered me the most were these:  1. our main server was annoying (and that is saying a lot since he spent very little time with us), telling me to order more food because it was not going to be enough.  Asked me to order another steak because from his experience this is not enough food.  News for you buddy, we didn't come here to order based on your experience, we like to dine however we prefer to dine, which in our case, if we need more food we will order more. His \"experience\" was total crap coz we had a lot of leftovers, glad I didn't order more than the sides for dinner. If he were a little more observant, our party of 8 comprised of 6 seniors, which \"experience\" will tell you they don't eat much and probably have dietary restrictions but they were there to spend time with family and enjoy some food while doing that. 2.  he never came back to us when I didn't order more, then he served more appetizers we did not order nor asked for. 3.  When we asked for 1 bottle of wine, he set down two bottles on our table.  We asked them to take away the extra one but he said to leave it on the table just in case. I told the server not to open the other one unless my parents wanted, which by the way they didn't want, but since they thought I ordered two bottles they drank it all. 2 out of 8 people drank the last bottle of wine.   4. WHERE IS MY SERVER? After 1 hour of talking and eating appetizers we were wondering where is our steak?  I had to call someone to bring out steak. Guess what? IT WAS ALREADY READY but was never brought out. I asked the server, who was not the main server who took our order, \"WHY didn't you bring the steak out?\" he answered \" You were still eating the appetizers and we were waiting for you to finish them\". I thought to myself \"Is he *#$%ing kidding me?\"  I am at at a restaurant to eat and how the #uck should I know when the kitchen is done preparing two 34 oz T-bone steaks unless they bring it out? When I asked them to serve it already they said they were going to heat it up again (HEAT UP AGAIN?! It's like telling me, oh wait let me microwave your food for you so it comes out as if it's freshly cooked) but it ended up charred and my wife couldn't eat any of it without gagging.  NEXT TIME, pay attention to the table because we were done with our appetizers within the first 15 mins they brought them out. Everyone was grazing on whatever is left (which was a lot still, but you can tell people were just talking and were really DONE) while waiting for the steaks. AND had they not served the extra appetizers we didn't order, then they wouldn't think that we were still finishing our appetizers! 5. Do you guys train your servers to upsell on the table? And when they don't take you up your offer, do it anyway coz they won't say no once the food is on the table?  Serve extra food we didn't ask for and sneak it in the bill? SHADY!!! This night was absolutely the worst Echo and Rig experience for me and embarrassing in front of my parents and their friends.  I probably won't go back for a while. This is BS because I had to leave early since my pregnant wife was starting to get nauseous, but I am sure my parents still paid 20% tip on this BS bill.  I am actually surprised how different my experience was compared to my first visit (maybe because we ordered the top of the line, most expensive steak that time?).  How can you tell when a restaurant is not confident about their own food? When it is a tad saltier than normal.  That night was extremely salty on every order including the burnt steak.    I don't recommend the almost bald little heavy set server with short hair (the MIA main server).  He is a little loud when he talks and likes listen to his own voice.  He didn't like it when I cut him off because I didn't want to waste his time since I knew what we wanted. Please train your employees better.  Next time I visit (just to see if there is any improvement) and this happens again, I will yell at the server.   THIS IS WHY I HATE THE TIPPING CULTURE.  IT'S STUPID AND IT SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE PRICE SO THE RESTAURANT WILL BE MORE LIABLE FOR EACH SERVER'S ACTION AND THE REPUTATION YOU ESTABLISH WHEN YOU HAVE TERRIBLE SERVERS.",

    "text": "This is for dinner service, never been here for brunch.  One of the best valued steakhouses around. Service is always top notch, the hostesses are nice and make small talk while taking you to your seat, and the managers always make a point to stop by and say hello. It's nice to have an establishment pay attention to little details like that. Most servers are pretty awesome, there are a couple who really try to upsell you on different things - we just ask not to be seated in their section.   We love rib cap, and Echo and Rig is one of the few places that have this cut in town (and for such a great price!!).  We have received our steaks overcooked a couple times, and they are always quick to re-fire a new one and bring it out ASAP (Derrick, one of the managers, even boxed an overcooked one up for us to take home once, talk about superb service). We've only tried the steaks, so I can't say anything about the entrees. You can't go wrong with any of the cuts. The appetizers are generally pretty tasty, too. I love the baked brie in the garlic-butter brushed sourdough. It's perfect with the gooey cheese and tangy fruit compote on the buttery toasted bread. If in the mood for charcuterie, they do have one available and they make all the meats in house. It's not on the dinner menu, so you'll have to ask for it. (I wish they would add some cheese!)   I'm a sucker for a great Hendricks martini, and I promise you the bartender (I'm sorry I don't know your name) makes one of the best ones in town.  I've been all over looking for a good martini and places like Picasso, SW, Mandarin Bar, Olives, Other Mama etc etc don't even stack up.   No corkage fee, and we take full advantage. We've even stopped by Total Wine a couple times before dinner to grab a bottle (just call me a lush).  Don't forget to scrub your hands with the divine salt scrub in the restrooms too!  More like 4.5 - minus points for the couple of pushy servers and sometimes inconsistent meat temps.",

I got the table at their patio on second floor with view of swan fountain of tivoli village. There are many options of appetizers on menu. I got to tried grilled octopus, Protebello fries, bone marrow asada, pumpkin. Ohhh, grilled octopus n bone marrow were great! I also tried their lamb chop, seabass, grilled chicken and salmon. They were all pretty decent! Price here is definitely off strip price! You can also bring your own wine to restaurant. They don't charge corkage fee here!",

    "text": "Fine meat is worth paying for (and waiting for) and Echo & Rig serves up some quality meat! This place is right by my house and I intend to become a regular. The decor is fantastic, as is the service and the food quality.   The place was packed and we had a 45 minute wait. It wound up being more like an hour, but it's close enough. We asked for bread because we were starving. We asked for bread 3 more times from 2 separate people and we finally got it. I gave them a pass because the servers were running their asses off. The service was so good that they even helped us play jokes on the table across from us that was having a family dinner. We may have happened to know the people at that table, so don't just try that on complete strangers.   My first time here, I split a gigantic flinstones-esque tomahawk steak. They even bring out the steak and show it to you before taking it back to the kitchen to cook it. That was a nice touch. If you want bigger or smaller, you can let them know and they will accommodate. They warned us that the steaks take a while since they're so thick. We didn't mind, we finally had bread to snack on. It tasted fantastic, albeit cooked slightly less than we had ordered it. Every bite was incredible.   Another awesome thing about Echo & Rig is that they sell raw steaks to go, and at pretty reasonable prices to boot. I need to stop in soon and pick some up to grill up at home.   My only real knock is that this place doesn't take reservations. That's always a bummer. A reservation would have improved our experience by cutting down on the wait time tremendously. Oh well, can't win em all. If you are a carnivore and haven't tried Echo & Rig yet, you are overdue! Just make sure to give yourself time, you'll be doing a fair amount of waiting.",

Our waiter Jesse was very nice, even showed us platter with steaks they offer. My husband ordered steakhouse cuts Rib-Eye and I ordered the Spencer steak. As appetizer we had portabello fries - delicious. But when the steaks arrived, mine looked good, nice thick steak, but very dry inside. My husband's Rib-Eye steak was 1/4inch flat steak and first bite he had to spitted out because it was chewy. he was very dissapointed. I ended up giving him my steak. We called our waiter, saying this place is butcher house and you are serving these tiny flat steak?! He took it back, never asked us if we wanted to order something else, and he said the manager will come to our table and talk to us. Never happened!!! Our waiter asked us 3 times if any of the managers came to our table. I saw managers walking around, talking to each other, practically doing nothing and none of them came and apologize. The owner of this place should fire all the managers right away. Very rude of them. I work as a hotel concierge on the strip, and I will never recommend this place to the guest or my family and friends!",

Good happy hour deals and fantastic ambience. Great restroom too! Prices are reasonable. Generous with drinks:).  Loved the black seafood pasta oh and the Burrata! Great options...

We finished our dinner with an order of the espresso sundae.  We left fully satiated, and we have enough leftovers for dinner tomorrow night.  Including a glass of wine, the meal was less than $100.

If you're wanting more meat, they sometimes offer a butchers cut of a 36oz porterhouse! All of the sides are delicious, but make sure you try: the watermelon tomato & cucumber salad, the bacon, the octopus salad, the crab cake, and the asparagus with egg.  And the deserts.

We were greeted by a great host once we were seated who apologized for the wait and wished us a happy anniversary.  But once he left, it took a good 15 minutes before we could place an order.  The appetizers came within 10 minutes but our steaks took almost an hour.  The waiter did apologize for the wait but it was disheartening to see other people seated after us getting their food before us.    The first round of drinks came very quickly but the second took so long that we wondering if it was going to make it before we got the check.    Maybe it was an off night for them.  The food - as always - was amazing but the service was really really slow.  To be fair, it was a Wednesday night and the place was really busy.

The best part of my experience was getting to pick my own cut of steak. The cut you pick is the cut you get. The choices were tomahawk ribeye, porterhouse, and a T-bone. Israel was a fantastic server, who remembered our name and remembered why we were there constantly. One of the best servers i have had in a long time! Xavier was the hospitality manager who i personally watched bus a table and clear glasses from another. This means a lot to a customer who use to run a catering business. Having a manager who is a team player is the manager you want to have running your business!  All around i give this 5 stars because as a 25 year old money doesn't grow on trees, nor do i have a lot of it. I work really hard for my money and I felt like it was absolutely well spent on coming to Echo and Rig for my girlfriends birthday. Israel is amazing and you would be a fool not to ask for him to be your waiter!!!!",

We were given some ham appetizer which was supposed to make up for their error???  A very nice young man named \"Ryan\" kept bread on the table and water in the glasses.

We Showed up at 730pm and we waited almost 30 minutes for our table with no explanation.  The young women that walked us to our table was friendly and asked great discovery questions relating to why we were dinning . We were taken to the patio when we had stated indoors ( the patio looks amazing ) however it was 115 out . We were moved quickly . The restaurants managers had also greeted us when we walked by .  Upon being seated we our server introduced himself as Jason . He immediately addressed the birthday celebration and the one guest in our party in town visiting . Great service touch between the hostess and server to get know their customers . Jason the server then introduced the Resturant manager also named Jason to us as well . Great way to show their commitment to service by engaging the manger from the start .  We ordered many side plates \"appetizers\" suggestions included by Jason .The Grilled Thick-Cut Bacon & Barbecue Sauce was one of his best suggestions . It was excellent also The Fried Spinach red onion, cauliflower, broccoli & chile-lime vinaigrette was amazing !  Also loved the Over The Rainbow farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette  We all had order steaks ... We had six in our party 3 of the steaks were cook to order,  the other 3 were not .  Jason the server and Jason the manager both intervened immediately and offered to have new steaks ordered and cooked to our order .  At that point we didn't want to wait and we had plenty of food ... If anything we had over ordered side plates , salads , and then our sides with our meal .  I appreciated their attention and service . They did remove from our tab. Nice gesture .  There is a concern that they are suppose to be known for their meat and their chef's should be cooking to order .  Sometimes things can be off with the meat and maybe an off night for the chef ?  We will be sure to be back ... Especially for the price .  The sorbet was made in house and delicious as well .  Last note ... We loved the women's Resturant ! Great decor , clean , and girly.  The had amazing soap and bath salts to use ! Great extra amenity !",

    "text": "Wanted to LOVE it; just liked it.  A lovely atmosphere; buzzing busy for Sunday brunch.    Bottomless Mimosas are great.   The issues fall on the preparation/flavors, and mediocre service at the bar.   \"roasted potatoes\" were clearly deep fried for faster delivery...along with the peppers and onions.   Deep fried.    Tell us they are fried potatoes, and all is well, but these were listed as roasted.    Potato pancakes were perfect.     Poached eggs with asparagus, potatoes, goat cheese, beets, carrots dish - very bland.   That's fine, but the bartenders never asked how everything was, so we had to find salt/pepper/hot sauce at the end of the bar.   Totally helped the flavor; just a service issue there.    Not steak eaters, so cannot provide feedback there.   Love Tivoli Village, love the place, just not up to our expectations.    If the service would have been even close to over the top, we would give 4 or 4.5 stars. Bartender never asked how the food was; never checked on us; without conversation kept our mimosas full - just going through the motions.  We are locals that love to sit at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere.   Just not at Echo and RIg.   Above mediocre flavors become great with amazing service.",

They have their own butcher downstairs! The spinach salad is different- crispy and refreshing. A very nice atmosphere for lunch and dinner. Managers are always very nice. Wait staff is hit or miss.

The bottomless mimosas are fantastic and truly bottomless, not like some places that call them bottomless but limit you to 4 or something. We've tried most of their brunch menu but my favorites are the short rib hash, the ny egg sandwich, and the 1/2 thick grilled bacon. Our server Nan is always great and fun to talk to and the manager is also very sweet, though I haven't caught her name. I'd recommend sitting in the balcony as it overlooks the rest of Tivoli Village and if you go on Saturday's they sometimes have an outdoor market set up where you can go shop after brunch. It's a cool place.",

If I were to have a \"Last Meal\"... THIS IS THE PLACE! Seriously!!  From the moment you walk in, you are warmly greeted by their staff.  From there to walk up the stairs into a perfectly decorated dining room, AMAZING! The kids LOVE watching the kitchen.  We have been in there right after a baseball game in full baseball gear to business casual pants and shirts and have always been treated exactly the same... AMAZING! The food is ALWAYS top notch for us. Nothing short of perfection!!  I refer ALL of my friends who are headed to Vegas to go there.  Here is a recent E-mail I received from a family member who went this past Thursday....   \"From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty! From the warm ambience,to the fabulous food, to your outstanding staff! Everything was first class! (Did you also arrange that fabulous full moon?)   We so appreciate the scrumptious desserts you sent out for us...Not a crumb was left!   Again, thank you for a most wonderful evening....\"   It is definitely worth the drive out to visit Echo & Rig! You will NOT be sorry!",

I didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside).   Smoked Salmon Benedict ($17): Smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, creme fraiche, red onion, sauteed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on potato pancakes. The elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. The spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. The menu says 'sauteed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach that might complement the salmon more? We really didn't like the spinach with the smoked salmon. So, I just ate them separately. The hollandaise was fantastic. The potato pancakes were all right. It seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. Also, I'm not sure what happened, but I didn't see any creme fraiche or red onion..?  Short Rib Hash ($15): Prime short rib, Yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. Great hash! What made it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. The diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.  We had some Small Plates as well and they were really wonderful. I highly recommend ordering them and I'd love to try the others during another visit.  Portobello Fries ($9) with a herb aioli. If you fell in love with these fries at Bottega Louie in L.A., you'll be thrilled that we have them in Vegas now! I love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great aioli that ties it all together. YUM!  Maryland Crab Cake ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. This is one of the best crab cakes I've had and I loved the coulis with it. The cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. Great flavors. You'll wish there was more than one cake per order!  The 1/2-Inch Thick Grilled Bacon ($8) is AMAZING. It comes with a housemade BBQ sauce and trust me, you don't need it! The bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. The two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.  Service was great, as it was last time. Waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. We had a great time. Also, the food was delicious and satisfying. I certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. I'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. Perhaps I'll even brave another steak and/or dinner in the future.  Side note: The 'Steak Frites' is now served with New York Strip rather than Ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). I'm not a fan of NY Strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing that I did not enjoy the Ribeye I was served during my previous visit.",

    "text": "Coming to Vegas for my fiance's birthday and an scheduled engagement photo session meant that we would miss my mom's traditional family football Sunday steak dinner. With that said, I wanted steak.  Echo is about 20 minutes from Vegas and is located in a quaint shopping plaza. You walk in, the butcher is on the right next to their fridge with different charcuteries and pate.  We were seated indoors next to the patio overlooking the square. Upon seating, Xavier, the manager, greeted us and introduced us to Laura. I couldn't be further from home but they made us feel so welcomed. They even brought us a glass of champagne to celebrate the engagement!  Started out with a Caesar salad which was big enough to share and the pork belly with spicy slaw. Pork belly had a nice char on the outside and it just melted in your mouth. It was a nice bite with the crunch of the slaw and the vinegar acidity of the sauce.   The rib eye was an 8oz cut prepared medium with a blue cheese sauce on the side. Hands down, best steak I've ever had.. Sorry Mom! The salty outside char on this quality of a steak was perfect.   Love Echo! Special thanks to Xavier and Laura! And of course The Cooks!",

    "text": "I just read reviews posted by Kristin J.  I had the most embarrassing and disappointing experience at this restaurant. Took my mother and two of her friends for dinner at this, what would I thought be special, restaurant for her birthday dinner on Monday, September 17.  We had a 730p reservation.  By 750p we placed our orders. At about 850p we had been served 5 water refills, 1 cold loaf of bread and 1 possibly near warm loaf of bread. When I approached the \"manager\" and inquired about my order, he was going to check on it and get back to me. After waiting another 15 minutes, I again approached the \"manager\" and again asking about our order. \"let me find out\" said he. I was suddenly his \"friend\". He put his hand on me at least 5 times and by 9p, maybe, we still had no salads or anything that resembled food. I became very irate. I am still his \"friend\". Not! Was then ask to stop speaking so loud. Still his friend. Not!  Nothing on the table looked like food. When I was so frustrated, I walked out before this escalated. Finally leaving he offered to comp our salad and dessert. Not enough service or manager concern. Ruined my mom's birthday. I will never go to this restaurant again. I am sure they will not miss me. Absolutely pay with a credit card so you have a little protection so you can report them for being a bad restaurant. Thank you for reading this. Good luck! I actually think that they deserve \"0\" stars.",

They have been out there almost two years, he has been there three as a Sous Chef at one of the finer restaurants on the strip. So we eat out four very high priced meals, and this was the last before leaving the next day, and by far the best and most reasonable for quality and taste. Now we aren't foodies but we are meaties between my family who raise beef and pork for a living, and my two daughters whom both have degrees in Meat Science and were on National Champion Meat and Livestock Teams in college. The steaks were quality cut and priced for the menu, and passing around on of the fish entrees was really good as well.  I will tell all my friends when in Vegas this is the steak house!!!!",

I figured that coming to a butcher/meat restaurant that I would be looking for a steak or a sandwich with some meat on it. I asked my waiter (who pretty much lived up to every  expectation that I've ever had of a waiter, his name was Jeffrey and he's worth requesting) what his favorite sandwich was. He admits that he was a meat junky but his favorite sandwich was the Drunken Goat and it didn't even have meat on it. It was legit and worth the drive from downtown Las Vegas. The Brussel sprouts and the portobello fries were great. The Portobello fries are a super up version of salt, cheese, and lightly battered shrooms that, once dipped in the aoli sauce will leave you wishing you had more...and for $5, com'on man!!!",

We had impeccable service, the manager stopped by to formally introduce himself and say welcome. Wonderful wine list was offered. Steaks amazing, the sea bass cooked perfectly and the sides! We has portabello mushrooms seasoned, sliced like wedges and lightly battered. Amazing. The experience was so worth the drive we would definitely do this again.

The on duty manager came by multiple times to ensure enjoyment and quality (probably because general manager heard about our first experience).   Everything ordered was prepared with excellence and tasted wonderful. Steaks were cooked to perfection and all appetizers delicious. Something I would definitely recommend is the fire roasted cauliflower. If i could eat that every day I would.   Dessert was just as good, we say the manager and waitress walk in and out with our tray several times for what seemed to be less than satisfactory spoons.   The overall experience was quite pleasant, everything delicious, and they were very sure to rake care of us. Based on this experience i would go back again.",

The price was fair! I never felt like I was getting gouged in the pocket book!! Wine prices were super fair and because of the prices I bought an additional bottle! Same with the sides! I ordered so many lol. They were great. Service was great. Steaks were great! The staff is very Courteous and eager to make you feel welcome. We dine at some very nice places across the country. I have to say were I feel like the price, food, service was so good I want to share them everywhere!  It's not about can I afford the steak or side that's 5.00 or 25.00 more.... it's can I justify the price...... great ethics here at Echo and Rig.   Another note; Ramon was our server and Kevin naylor the manager came by to say hello and was a delight to speak with. My wife and I came in just in a black Tshirt and shorts. Everyone was dressed up. Dolled up! Here we are the bums lol. They treated us like we gold. I say this only because we have went to other higher end Restaurants and we are a very casual couple who does not like to get completely dressed up and dolled up just to go make an appearance in public. Some other restaurants will treat you like you are not worth there time.  Never knowing your turbo Porscha is sitting out front lol.   So it's Kinda fun to screw with them! Sorry I'm rambling! Either way this place was great!   The beast steak house in Las Vegas.  Off the strip but close!  Thank you again!",

We started with the Maryland Crab Cake which I normally love but this one however tasted very fishy....I am guessing they use the entire crab not just the crab leg.  It is definitely fresh as we found pieces of shell in the cake.  So overall it's not the best we've had and if you are not an avid seafood person you may not like this one.  Next we had the chopped vegetable salad which is raw salad and was actually very good.  So many items along with the dressing made this a fantastic dish.  The only item among all the vegetables that neither of us found was the avocado which it says on the menu is supposed to be in the salad which our waiter confirmed.  He did check with the kitchen and they said it was in there but I have a picture and taste buds on two people who can say it's not.  Nicholas did offer to bring us some slices which was awesome on his part but at that point almost being done with the salad and ready to move on to the next course we told him not to worry about it.  We also had the THICK cut smoked bacon with bbq sauce...yum  Next we had the ribeye along with asparagus covered with a fried egg which I really enjoyed.  Finished with the Salted Caramel Sunday that I watched and did not indulge as I was stuffed and very satisfied.  The service was AMAZING...Nicholas made sure all out needs were met and really provided top notch service.  I'm sure we will go back again some time, the service and food are too good to let little things keep us away.",

Others were in cut off shorts and tank tops.. not what we expected. The service was amazing! I believe our server was Hugo. And the others who helped were super friendly too! We ordered 4 starters, the butchers sausage was amazing. The pork belly and bacon were ok and the calamari was over cooked. They were out of the ribeye cap so I got the regular ribeye cooked medium. The pieces that didn't have stringy white fat in it were very good. It was hard to eat because of this, I was constant piling fat strings out of my mouth. One of my coworkers said the same. We ordered five sides with our meal.. Brussels sprouts were a little too charred, macaroni and cheese was very bland but the mashed potatoes and broccolini were super good!! We were too full to eat the sweet potato.",

The hostess informs us the dining room is booked for a special event, but that we could dine in the bar area. No problem - I was there for the delicious drunken goat I devoured months before.   Long story short, avoid dining at the bar because you will be IGNORED, unless you are sitting at the actual bar affront the bartenders. After we finally ordered our drinks, it took so long to come out - how hard is it to get a diet coke and a couple waters when the bar is RIGHT THERE? Next, it took over 25 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered - it was just a couple drunken goat sandwiches and some poached eggs for veggies. While waiting, we were not offered bread, nor refills drink refills. Wth...  Then the food finally arrives. The sandwiches were soggy :( After raving all morning about the deliciousness that was the drunken goat, what arrived were thicker layers of semi-toasted bread that became soggy from sitting out too long.... sighhh.  This will probably be my last visit to E&R. The quality control and service went downhill from just a few months ago. So sad!",

Within minutes of being sat the manager was over at the table, asked for me by name, from my reservation and engaged us in polite chit chat then introduced our server to us.  Never experienced that intro before, was a nice touch. Server was attentive, knew the menu well and described his favorites which sounded amazing so we had some.  Drinks were delivered promptly, fresh lemonade was delicious and refreshing. Meals arrived in a timely manner, all hot and at the same time.  Our friends had the grilled cheese and hamburger both were delicious.  Johan had prime rib hash with poached eggs, juicy and tasty and I had the farmhouse skillet and the filet mignon was melt in my mouth delicious. Server checked in on us and we never wanted for any refills.  Place got pretty packed and I can see why.  Will have to come back for dinner and enjoy a steak.  New visit 10/11/2018 3 Stars  I'm a huge fan of echo and rig, in my business I do dining recommendations and have always raved about there food and especially service.  Tonight however we were let down on both fronts.  Host was lovely, we were greeted and seated quickly, she wish us a happy birthday.  Manager came over and welcomed us and wished a happy birthday.  Server assistant came over with water and bread.  We finished both and were still waiting for our server.  It's always busy here the dozen times I've visited but we've never had such slow and inadequate service. Finally server appeared, we were ready to order everything.  He only took drink order and rushed off saying he'd be back soon.  Server assistant delivered our drinks, even refilled them TWICE before our server arrived, seemed rushed and distracted.  Ask for recommendations between soups and was just told both were nice.  We've always had servers that are passionate about their jobs and the menu, this was disappointing for sure.  Felt rushed eating appetizers, hovering over our table and within seconds of clearing it our entrees were there.  Mashed potatoes were more lumpy than usual, broccolini was burnt, not charred but burnt, we didn't eat either and full sides pushed to the edge of the table didn't indicate to anyone there was a problem.  Both ribeyes were supposed to be medium well, but were barely medium and not overly hot, I have a problem with my meals not being hot and everything was bordering on lukewarm.  Our server whisked by and said \"everything tasting good\" and was gone, didn't even stop or wait for a response.   We eventually got a free dessert for the birthday, I would have liked a coffee but was not asked.  Check eventually arrived. Left us very disappointed for a special night out.  This is not the kind of food or service we have received in past visits here.",

They were very accommodating with our big group along with our bottomless mimosas!  Food 5/5  Is that possible? I got the short rib hash which was really big and well cooked. I wish there were more ways to incorporate more veggies but alas. It was extremely flavorful and smoky. Make sure to get the hash  Obviously bottomless mimosas!  Um I also happened to have room for dessert and got their in house sorbet! I loved the grapefruit one the best!  For a brunch of that magnitude and quality - this place is well worth it.....now to only find something on the eastern side of the US....",

I started with calamari, which was really good but not astounding.  The main course center cut ribeye with chimichuri and the horseradish sauce was absolutely amazing.  Cooked perfect, over wood ifred grill, amazing cut of beef.  The brussel sprouts, too notch, nice char and subtle lemon flavors.  Last, but not least, I am usually disappointed by steak house mac n cheese.  This was not the case here, hands down, best mac at a steakhouse ever!  Service was exceptional as well.

We ordered a variety of the small plates creamed kale, mashed potato's, steak and eggs, shrimp cocktail, sausage, and a Maryland crab cake. All of this was flavored perfectly, and had great texture. The reason for the three stars is because the service was horrible. We sat in the bar area (since the upstairs was full.... I recommend making a reservation). The server took our order, but he never came back to check on us. We had to flag him down for what we needed. I get it your busy. Still stop go to check on your patrons. He was constantly checking on the party next to us and it appeared he knew them. I'm so happy you know them, but now your tip will reflect from us because you neglected us. I would have given four stars..... except on the way out the hostesses didn't thank us.... it's the little things. I'll be back to give them a try with a reservation. Hopefully next time the service is on point.",

Every body obviously is committed to your dining enjoyment. The operation is managed by one of the best general managers I've ever met in the business. And all credit to the staff as well from the chef to the host Steph... I am a local and however they treat me like I'm an owner.  My wife and I have a fairly extensive wine cellar and they will accommodate at no charge any bottle of wine we bring to the restaurant as policy. We are always sure to tip well for this service but there is no additional charge to bring your own bottle. This is just an example of how far they will go to make your dining experience a real pleasure.   Please give this place a try and tell them \"Ika\" sent you.",

I came here with some friends after a day hike in red rocks and was able to enjoy the Happy Hour. There was a very good selection of Happy hour draft beers,cocktails, and good white wine. An amazing place to drink for the on the cheap. There was an excellent selection of draft beers, a lot of which came from local nevada/vegas breweries. The food was also amazing - all the food was under $3 and of great quality. The steak and eggs were amazing, the steak is usually ends of other steaks available in the house, so random cuts. It could be filet mignon, or a ny cut strip - all the cuts we had were amazing.  We also had dinner after Happy hour and the service was impeccable. We were seated immediately and had the opportunity to order some amazing appetizers. The bone marrow is the dish to try - very generous portions with a smooth creamy texture. There is nothing quite like the steak at this place. To die for.",

First off the room we were sat in was sooooo loud and after waiting for 30+ minuets with a reservation we were sat. There was a few large parties that must have all been connected because people were just running around loudly from table to table. It was quite obnoxious. The food was bland and needed seasoning.

We've looked at the menu and thought this place must be good plus the reviews were all pretty decent. But here is the conclusion that we all agreed on. The food is about a 3 and the service was a 5 so the average out to a 4 star rating. I dunno maybe a bad day? I think I will definitely give this place another shot.   We had a lot of dishes here I love that we ate our meal family style versus individually I recommend anyone to do that. Here's what we had   Octopus salad-liked the dressing but the combination wasn't great don't recommend   Bone marrow carne asada-this was ok I'm used to this having a sweet contrast to the dish but this was sour but the carne asada was good!  Lamb cigars- least favorite just an egg roll nothing special at all   Parmesan risotto- good flavor just texture was bad  Duck dish- could do without the wild rice side and seem like that duck could've been executed a little better was tough  Lamb chops-was really good so soft and buttery and not gamy at all.   Broccolini-not a broccoli guy so just whatever. Lol  Mushroom soup- not bad just super simple  Best thing on the menu was an off menu item. Tomahawk rib eye!! We chose the 36oz cut I was blown away from the display they had with the exact cut you pick is the one you eat! Awesome selling point that we enjoyed! But the steak was very fatty but cooked ok. I expected a lot more as far as my experience here today and maybe I over anticipated this visit I will give it another shot. Thanks for the food and service was phenomenal! Our glasses were always filled with water and always people asking if you're ok",

Sat on the patio and the manager was the first to greet us. Then took the server 20min later to even come to our table for our order. Was first more concerned if we closed our check at the bar. Then never came back to check on us once our food was dropped. The food runners was the only one who was helpful. We sat for 20min with dirt dishes and still no one has even approached the table and asked for anything else. I had to get up and ask for a manager just to tell them how bad they were doing and just wanted a check to leave. Then the server came bad to apologize about us feeling neglected, not taking ownership of providing terrible service. As industry professionals, it takes a lot to write a review but this was the worst experience ever. I'd rather go to the strip and dine at the Wynn for the same price, better service and quality.",

Pros:  Awesome wines... had two bottles of the zin, awesome sides.... had an awesome garlic mash and asparagus with a fried egg; awesome service... our server was sociable and on point with everything; and awesome oysters... these things were the right temperature, size, texture, and the spicy sauce was perfect.   Cons: not so awesome steaks which surprised me because this place is known for their steaks. I asked for medium rare, but I got a steak so well done that all the juices were burnt out of it. One thing I've noticed about a lot of steak houses is that if 3 out of 4 of your table ask for well done steaks, and you ask for medium rare, then you're steak is coming out like everyone else's... well done! Another issue I had inside was the general ambience. Not sure how to put it in words, but my table sat in front of the stairs, the kitchen was open to view and noise 10 feet away with the bright florescent lights encroaching into the dining area.",

I came here for dinner on a Sunday night with a large group of 10, and it was not packed at all. They have a family style option, so if you're curious about that the waitress will give you a presentation of the different cuts of steak. However, we opted for an entree each. I'm giving Echo & Rig 4 stars based on the attentive service, and the taste of the small plates and steak. However, my rib cap came out too charred the first time, so all I tasted was burnt meat. Also, my friend's lamb chops came out a little more raw than he expected. The waitress fixed my order as soon as I told her, but for a steakhouse with the prices that they charge I was a little disappointed. Also, we asked for more bread multiple times, but it never came or it would come out cold. I would only come here if I was craving better quality steak than Outback, while not dropping a few bills like I would at Mastro's.",

Off to a good start, as the ground floor is a nice butcher shop and was then seated upstairs on the balcony, which was very comfortable.  Rather than specific starters, they offer different small plates that can accompany the main or serve as a starter.  My group shared steak tartare and grilled thick cut bacon with barbecue sauce.  Both were very good.  For a main, they offer steaks on the menu or you can choose a larger steak that they bring by on a tray raw (a little overused by steakhouses these days).  I shared a T-bone with a friend, again good but not in the same league as Wolfgang's or Peter Luger's in New York.    Overall, a good meal at a reasonable price but not an unforgettable steak house.",

After his thourough examination he agreed it was way overdone and said he would have it recooked. 2nd steak was an end cut of fillet with so many tendons I could not even cut it. A fillet should be tender enough to cut with a butter knife. Steak knife wouldn't even do the job. You would think 3rd time is the charm NOPE! 3rd steak very thin and again tendons prevented it from being able to be cut. We realized there was no sense sending it back so it was set aside. Shocked when there was no offer of any kind to make amends and charged $35.80 for a piece of rubber. Will never return.",

My boyfriend and I came here last night and we were seated at a very nice table on the upstairs patio overlooking Tivoli. The temperature was very comfortable as they had fans and misters outside. Our server Ramon was great! He was very knowledgeable and our food came out fast. I let them know I wasn't able to drink, and they made me a delicious blackberry mojito mocktail. We ordered lamb cigars, brie in sourdough, bone marrow carne asada, beef tartare, portobello fries, and barramundi. I would highly recommend any of these dishes, although the bone marrow was my favorite and my boyfriend liked the lamb cigars. The barramundi was cooked perfectly with crispy skin. I would also like to mention that our busser was very attentive. When he came to take our plates, he saw me trying to brush off some bread crumbs and used his crumb scraper to clean up the whole table. He even wiped away the water rings on the table, then proceeded to wipe the bottom our of glasses so it wouldn't create more water rings. I really appreciated that level of service. Thank you for a great night, Ramon and Xavier!",

When we did sit down at our table, Derrick, Josh, and Brian did an amazing job introducing us to the place and overall just fantastic. They were all very enthusiastic We were constantly checked on, and they made sure that we were always satisfied. Amazing!   Second, the food. The wait was a little long, but we didn't mind.

Here are my go to favorites that I order almost every time I have dinner here:   Portobello fries, fried spinach salad, roasted califlower, and the pork belly and slaw. All the steaks are GMO and hormone free, all natural beef. The filet will melt in your mouth!   The dirty Martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives are an awesome addition. Plus it doesn't hurt that their well vodka is Kettle One.   Great food for a great price!",

I am somewhat taken aback by all the 5 star reviews because the food, while unusual, was not all that great. Here are the comments from my 5 friends going around the table:  New York egg sandwich -two eggs on an English muffin with a slice of bacon and a small green salad. Liked, would order again. Also had potato pancakes -- delicious.   Goat cheese quiche: Very \"goaty\" and sharp. Okay, but would not order again.  Fried chicken salad: A big bowl of lettuce with sliced fried chicken on top. A few tiny veggies, but mostly lettuce. Disappointing.  Over the Rainbow Salad: The winner of the day. Loved it, would definitely order again (one other diner had been to E&R before and had that and also loved it.)   The eggs benedict with salmon. It looked delicious but was rated \"okay,\" would not order again.  Grilled cheese sandwich with short rib meat. Grilled to perfection, but skimpy. Two pieces of cheese with bits of meat. Came with yummy potato crisps, but a small salad would have been more welcome. Would not order again.  The prices were not outrageous for a nice restaurant -- about $12 for salads and sandwiches.The service was fine -- nothing to rave about.   I will probably go back and try something different. Good location, easy parking.",

Went on a Sunday and it was pretty busy but nothing a glass of wine to wait with cant fix. We sat outside on the heated patio -so comfortable and was greeted by Devin. He's was awesome the whole night thru and helped with the menu. Started with the cauliflower and pepper small plate. Along with the garlic mashed potatoes - they have a good selection to go off of. Hard to choose just one. Both were amazing flavor and great size. We got the Trenne prime rib eye pasta and the hanger steak sandwich . For how amazing the food was the price is great as well. The texture, quality and savory melt in your mouth flavor is so inviting. It's refreshing to have real- good food. Ended with their Carmel Sunday and coffee. Not too full but definitely satisfied!

    "text": "Wow....this place was impressive. We went for a couple's dinner...not celebrating anything special...just a nice dinner...and that's what we got. We made reservations on Open Table, which is always awesome when that is an option. When we arrived, we had time to look at the amazing butcher shop downstairs. We didn't get a chance to stop by the bar downstairs, but it looked like a hoppin' spot!! The host staff promptly took us upstairs to our seats. The place was busy and there were plenty of Echo and Rig staff to meet all the needs. Almost as soon as we sat, the manager came over and introduced himself and gave us some of the story of the restaurant and the Head Chef. (Who recently beat Bobby Flay!). The manager truly seemed excited to tell us about it...he was a young guy, so it was cool to see him so animated!  When our waiter arrived, he was just excited as the manager to work with us and explain the different cuts of meat and preparation, etc. He was able to knowledgeably recommend wines to us. He was amazingly attentive throughout the entire meal. The food was top notch. We all ordered steak...mostly filet mignon which melted in our mouths!!! We had a mashed potato side dish that was delicious and someone else in our party could not stop eating the macaroni and cheese!! Of course we were too stuffed to order any desserts but they looked amazing as well! I will definitely be back to Echo and Rig and highly recommend to anyone who wants a wonderful dining experience. (By the way...the prices are completely reasonable. I'm so used to L.A. prices, this meal seemed totally inexpensive to us!!)",

    "text": "Third meal here last night. Second dinner. Wish we could give 2.5 stars. It was Christmas eve, so perhaps this night was an anomaly. Echo & Rig, we may be falling out of love with you. :(  Starting with the positives:  -Cocktail was great (I finally figured it out! Just order a real up cocktail such as a Martini or Manhattan and stay away from the cocktail menu.) -Downstairs staff were pleasant and helpful. -Steaks were good. -Charcuterie plate was very good.  Now the draw backs:  -Had to wait over an hour to be seated. At least we had seats downstairs and could order drinks and a charcuterie platter while we were waiting. Why are reservations only for parties of 10 or more? -Stella on tap is great but no Stella glasses?  Negatives: -Upstairs Service SUCKED -We were not offered water choices and not told that there were no specials nor that what we wanted was not available until we asked (rib eye cap and asparagus.) We waited a long time between visits from waitstaff. Steaks took a long time. Staff seemed generally confused. Example: food porter stared at ticket after placing our entrees on a jack stand for at least a minute before bringing our plates. We saw several sides plates sent to tables who refused them because they didn't order them.  -Our guest said this is the second time he's been here and no rib eye cap was available. The server said \"it shouldn't be on the menu since it hasn't been available for 2 weeks\". So why is it on the menu? -My water glass was empty for a long time, more than once. -Server was borderline rude. -There seemed to be no secondary wait staff (no bussers?)  Xmas Eve or not, it was a high traffic night for the restaurant. Not trying to be harsh, but they've been open for a while now and have probably had other busy nights. Bottom line, seems like E & R needs to get their reservation protocol together. Maybe if they took reservations for smaller parties they'd be better prepared with appropriate wait staff. Also, we really miss Nora's Wine Bar.",

The hostess kindly brought us water and we were seated earlier than expected. Upstairs, inside, I found the place too noisy for conversing easily. Also, our table was vibrating! The server was kind but out of sight when I needed her twice. First, my sangria did not arrive in a timely fashion. Second, my seared ahi was very over cooked. They replaced it fairly quickly and even brought a small plate salad as a treat, though it was not appealing to me. The ahi was ok but not particularly flavorful. I had a side of sauteed spinach that was unevenly cooked. The drink was on the house, and there was the small plate buy all these repairs didn't make up for the uneven meal and service.",

The drinks arrived quickly, and our meals followed closely behind.   The steak I was served was flavorful, but rare as opposed to the medium I had requested.  I looked for our waiter who was nowhere to be seen.  I asked another waiter if he could find ours, to no avail.  I asked once again with no results.  Finally, I spied the Manager and motioned him over explaining that my steak was not prepared as requested.  By this time, my dining companions were almost finished.  What could have been easily fixed had our waiter bothered to check and make sure everything was okay, had spiraled into a far less than acceptable dining experience.  It wasn't even a result of the restaurant being busy as it was only 4:30pm and very quiet.  After we left, my Mother said that her filet was overdone and dry.  Wish I had known that before we left.  So half of our four entrees were prepared improperly.  Hardly the basis for a glowing recommendation.",

The service is excellent, the ambiance is perfect and the FOOD...Oh my gosh, the food is so good!      They don't take reservations unless you're a very large group, yet we didn't have to wait either time although the restaurant was crowded. We sat on the patio both times and caught the sunset the second time. Beautiful view.    They make excellent cocktails and also have reasonably priced bottled wine. I've also heard they do not charge a corking fee if you'd like to bring in your own bottle.     The Tapas/Appetizers I've tried were all quite special. I suggest: The Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions, The Brussels Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon, The Pork Belly, White Grits, Bitter Greens & Apple Cider Sauce, The Garlic Shrimp and The Bone Marrow Carne Asada so far...     Don't get too full because you've still got a main course to order. I love how the staff brings out the different cuts from the butcher shop in addition to the menu for you to choose from. The manager even gave us his card to call and \"reserve\" our cut for next time. We've done a Porterhouse, Ribeye, and Strip family style to try everything. All of the steaks were fantastic and I love how they slice them for you. The Ribeye so far is my favorite, it was really something special!     Unfortunately, I can't tell you about their desserts because I've been in food coma heaven after both meals and had no room left to indulge. I'm excited to try their Brunch and Lunch menus soon as well, they look pretty tasty!",

The hostesses and staff even watched the doors for us and let us know when the guest of honor was coming up the elevator so we could be ready. We ordered individual steaks and entrees and shared several a la carte side dishes. All the food was fantastic! Our server was so attentive and knowledgeable. He even brought paper and crayons out just for the couple of kids in our party. It was one of the best steaks I've had in a while and the food is beautifully made. The macaroni and cheese, the roasted carrots, and the asparagus with fried egg were stand out side dishes. The birthday girl was thrilled with the whole experience thanks to the chefs and staff at Echo & Rig! We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "All I have to say is this place was amazing. Me and a my friend decided hit up Vegas for a quick weekend and were out for some place new and looked on Yelp for some suggestions for a steakhouse. We wanted a quality steak without the extras of being too fancy and definitely above a Texas Roadhouse. As when we come we try to eat away from the Strip. So we arrive and we both look at one another and say that our wives will love this place. We walk in and immediately were greeted by the hostess which told us that it will be a moment while they get our table ready. She returns to as we were intrigued by the butcher shop and the display of meats. We walk up the stairs to the dining room and the ambience is great, the seating is comfortable and elegant. The manager was working the room and stopped by to say hello and see if we needed anything. He told us that our waiter Austin would be with us momentarily. Austin arrives and takes our drink order and we tell him we have never been here and asks for his suggestions. He suggested the Smoked and Charred Bacon,  the Chicken Oysters, and the Portobello Fries. They were all amazing. They also come buy with a selection of bone in cuts of steaks to choose from. Wanting to try something new and I never heard of a Spencer Steak, I was intrigued. My friend went for the big 46oz Tomahawk and we chose the creamed kale and the mashed cheddar and garlic potatoes. The steaks were great. All the food was amazing. After our meals we were so impressed that we immediately called our wives to plan a trip to Vegas just to bring her here. If they had a better rating they would get it. Echo and Rig gets 2 thumbs up from me and I will definitely suggest it to others. The service was impeccable, the food was amazing, and the cost was reasonable.",

    "text": "Grass fed kobe style steak. I could stop there but I won't.  You have to try the Spencer steak. It is what steaks want to be when they grow up.   But I will get into the food in a moment. The thing that made tonight so special was the service. Upon beong seated we were greeted by the manager who knew the name of our party right off the bat. He was very gracious came back to check up on us, but in that magical ratio where it isn't so much as to be annoying but just enough to know that these people truly care about you and your experience.   The waiter was amazing. We described a wine and he knew it immediately by name! We were never in want for anything throughout the entire meal. In fact I feel wonderfully spoiled. The restaurant was full. Yet there was plenty of room for everyone, it was quiet enough for table conversation and the waiter was amazingly attentive. I had to scan the restaurant a couple times to verify that yes, every table was occupied.    And now to the food. In a word: oubf#$/v*^#fdf!!! But as I'm sure that doesn't make sense, please allow me to expound upon this. As mentioned above, the Spencer was amazing.   The best steak I've had in Vegas, not just in organic grass-fed goodness but also in knock-your-socks-off flavor. I split this with my friend Big John and we also had the tuscan kale, the bone marrow carne asada, and the specialty sausage made by the in-house butcher. Plus three glasses of wine and a magical cocktail called the Dionysis (ketel 1, elderflower liquer, pomegranate seeds, unicorn tears, the hopes and dreans of small children).   Wanna know how much all that cost for the two of us? Less than 80 bucks. Wtf?! Yup. They just did that.",

So to the food:  Brussel Sprouts - Excellent tasting, the nice lemon flavor and crisp brussel sprouts.  Cauliflower with peppers - If you like a little spicy kick and cauliflower this is a good side dish.  Spicy Sausage - Not bad, not too spicy but good flavors.  Crab cake - Decent, not a huge crab cake fan but still good.  Octopus salad - octopus was a little dry that I got, but the flavors were good.   Bone Marrow Carne Asada -  AWESOME!  This is surprisingly really good.  The combination on top of a nice toasted bread.  Pumpkin Squash - A bit sweet, but I believe it's the sweetness of the squash.  Like a small grilled pumpkin.  Portebello Fries - Excellent appetizer, great pick as usual.  Pork Belly Grits - Not bad, pretty unique tasting.  Stir Fry Kale - Not bad, nothing that stands out.  Stuffed portebello - Decent, but didn't stand out compared to the other stuff.  Tomahawk Ribeye - Pretty tasty, cooked pretty tender.  A great thing we did get with this is a selection of the sauces, you need to ask for it though.  7 sauces tonight.  Black Spaghetti - DELICIOUS!  Still one of my favorite dishes here.  Nice lemony flavors with the sun dried tomatoes and seafood mix.  Highly recommended.",

The moment you walk in the door you are greeted with sincerity and interest as to who you are and where your from. Once your seated one of the managers introduces himself and inquires as to what part of the US or in our case what part of Arizona and California we were from. This info was obviously passed on from the hostess but what a great touch. Our waiter named Dillion came over with a sweet introduction along with a brief education and highlight filled description of the restaurant. Drink orders were taken based on recommendations from our waiter along with appetizers. No rush dining made this experience that much better and the education we received regarding the levels of beef and what to expect what first class. The entire meal  was incredible and the entire staff made you feel like you were the most important people in the entire place. We topped the evening off with coffee and dessert which were again excellent. No surprise that this restaurant was voted BESToff the strip RESTAURANT for 2017. Highly recommended if your looking for a top notch dining experience at a great value! Will be asking for Dillion when we return in December! All I can say is bravo and thanks for an exceptional evening.",

    "text": "Their butcher stand is located on the main floor along with a small bar, charcuterie stand and hostess area. You have to wait in this awkwardly laid out area with not enough seats for the hostesses to run up and down the stairs to the main seating area of the restaurant, one party at a time. My visit was on a quiet Saturday afternoon, yet we still managed to wait a solid 10 minutes to be seated with only two parties ahead of us. When we got upstairs I was pretty confused by how long we had to wait based on how empty the dining room was, hopefully they figured out a better system during busy hours! Then our waiter took the orders for the 10 person table near us and disappeared for a good 5 minutes before finally coming back to take our drink and food orders at the same time. Plus we pointed out that both of our water glasses were dirty so he swapped them with two from the table next to us, which got immediately placed back into that table setting. Yum! The dining room is a bit strange, very minimally decorated and doesn't seem too thought out. Their brunch menu is fairly decent, with a handful of salads, sandwiches, breakfasts, small plates and sides. There is a different dinner menu that is slightly different. I would also note that their burger is listed under the SANDWICHES section, for those that don't think a burger is a sandwich...  Their burger, in this case the Butcher Blend Burger, comes with USDA prime beef, bibb lettuce, Brandywine tomato and red onion. The bun was a little dry, but the meat was cooked to medium rare as ordered so it wasn't much of an issue. If this was a well done burger it would have been a vacuum of moisture. The meat had excellent flavor; it was very juicy, peppery and delicious. You could definitely tell this wasn't cooked with a frozen, pre-made patty. The sharp cheddar I added was flavorful and melted well, the tomato was colorful but didn't have a strong presence with the meat and oniony mystery base under the patty. I'm not quite sure what it was as that wasn't a listed item on the menu, but it was quite tasty.  Sadly the burger comes with chips, fries would have been extra. The chips were good; crunchy and of your kettle variety but not the fries I want with a good burger. Overall this was a pretty great deal for $12, but could have been way better with fries instead of chips. What makes this not such a great meal was the experience at the beginning and our service overall. I hate to say it but our waiter sucked, he was non-existent for much of our meal, never took away our table setup plates so our two-person table was a little crowded, and we sat for a full 10 minutes after our meals were done before he returned. We spotted him rolling silverware in the kitchen area while we sat around, and all the managers were having a little powwow to the side. The food seemed pretty good, but service like this is unacceptable even during quiet hours. I would probably have given my burger a better score based on the quality, but we walked out with such a bad feeling after this that I have to go by my overall experience. If you're in this area and want a great burger, stick with Honey Salt.",

My guests were so impressed and could not say enough about the quality of steaks so perfectly prepared and the atmosphere casual in a shiek way. My sister living in London has become accustomed to top notch eateries. She says \"bees knees\" and \"tidy Echo & Rig\" Thank you to the chef for wonderful food and to our waiter Edward who made our night with impeccable service. You made me shine for family and friends. The only negative was.... we had to leave! Lol",

    "text": "There are many good and great places in Vegas to eat. Good establishments are consistent and treat their guests very well. Great places go above and beyond in all areas of service. That so far is Echo and Rig. We stopped by to check out the Butcher shop and get some advice. The staff was friendly and eager to help. The place is kind of unique in the downstairs bar, sandwich and juice bar and butcher shop separated from  the large open dining room upstairs. We decided to eat and the first thing you notice is they record you name in a ledger downstairs and then the Server greets you by name (great point 1). The menu is a mixture of so many items you could get dizzy trying to decide which way to go. They had a small but diverse pasta selection (my favorite) and their butcher fresh meats and chicken, fish, sandwich and salad offerings (great point 2). They also have a large selection of \"small\" plate selections and again a lot of choices. They also on the menu back have a good selection of wines and liquors. My wife had the grilled cheese/short rib sandwich selection and on our servers advice the portobello mushroom/parmesan fries (do not pass those up). My pasta was served nice and hot very well done and a great bolognese meat sauce. It was a very good selection. My wife's sandwich while a good combination was somewhat greasy for her taste and she picked at half the sandwich. We mentioned this to our server and she apologized for her not liking the entree. She stated she would mention it to the chef for his knowledge (but we have heard that before). Several minutes later Keith the Manager came over to chat with us about our meal. This was not a casual sorry have a nice day chat but he was concerned about our experience (great point 3). He told us that this selection was a greasy type of combination, but if she didn't like it that was all that mattered. He spoke with us for about 10 minutes and then removed the entree from the bill (great point 4). This is what separates good from great, making sure the customer is always satisfied and their concerns addressed. This is not our last time to go and we look forward to trying other menu offerings in the future.",

Ive also had their steak sandwich. the reason i took off a star was because they gave me a burnt bun. even when i asked if i could get a new bun, the new bun was burnt too! so it changed the flavor of the sandwich. Other than that, all great!",

We didn't have any drinks before dinner and my expectations had dropped until the friendly hostess took us upstairs to meet our server Nicholas. Nicholas was full of wonderful personality and immediately turned around our initial negative experience. He works seamlessly with the rest of his team members and introduced us to Derek The manager. I ordered a whiskey sour and my wife had some type of champagne. We started off with the bone marrow, beef tartare, watermelon salad and those three dishes were top notch. My wife and I commented that the bone marrow dish specifically was probably a top three dish of our entire life. We go out to eat frequently and have no problem dropping a few hundred dollars on a good dinner. For our entrees my wife had the ribeye and And I had the lamb chops. We shared a cauliflower side dish as well. Our biggest surprise came when the bill came. Out the door including taxes and tip was under $130. We were so impressed with the service, the friendly attitudes, and the excellent food that we recommended the restaurant to a group of friends who were staying on the strip and they took advantage of the recommendation and the six of them went to the restaurant tonight. I can't say enough good things about the management team or our server Nicholas. I'm looking forward to going back and at that price I don't have to wait for a special event such as a birthday. We will definitely make this a regular occurrence when possible. Again, thank you Nicholas, Derek and the rest of your team for making our great night extremely memorable.",

The first thing I noticed is how pleasant the staff is. Beth, the manager; even came to our table and introduced herself and checked up on everything. Our server was Roland, who was absolutely great, he knew everything about the menu, and was more than happy to give us his suggestions when we couldn't figure out what exactly we wanted to try and it didn't hurt that he was a total hottie. There were five of us at the table and we all ordered different menu items and tried each one. Everything was delicious, literally no complaints. I personally had the steak frites, and it came out perfect. I'm not normally the type to have steak during brunch but I'm so glad I did this time. The atmosphere is light and airy, and the patio seating was so nice. I would absolutely recommend Echo & Rig to everyone I know.",

The bathroom had a very comfortable lounge chair, was spotless, and had a bowl of exfoliating salt scrub for your hands on the marble sink. I had the short-rib hash and my husband had the bacon, eggs, sausage and toast plate. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were generous. I got a bloody mary which was also wonderfully made. We will definitely return! Excited to try lunch or dinner.",

I was asked if I was celebrating anything from the host, I told her a new job, as soon as we sat down a manger came over saying congrats on my new job, that they would give me a sundae to say congrats. After he walked away we waited for at least 15 minutes before anyone came around, (the guy who was filling the water noticed us sitting there forever and tried to find someone to help us and couldn't ) So I flagged down a lady in a suit told her we still hadn't seen a waiter and if we could move outside(honestly just hoping to get someone to wait on us. Also she took my drink order, which I had ordered a bottle of wine. Was moved outside, she brought the wine. Then we waited another 10 minutes before we saw our waitress. ( also another manager(#3) came to say sorry and congratulated me on my job) the waitress finally came and took our order, a couple minutes later she brought a fruit salad(which I didn't order) thought it was complimentary since we hadn't been waited on for the first half hour in the restaurant . Got our food (it was delicious by the way) asked for the bill, I was charged for the salad I didn't order (and was not great) and never received a dessert. At this point I was so over it, I didn't even mention it, paid and left.  All in all,  Wait Staff=absolutely terrible, for such an upscale restaurant, the quality was below average.  Managers=great and friendly  Food=good",

Dinner started off with meatballs as well as fried chicken. The meatballs were amazing! They are flavored just right and really moist. I ordered a glass of the Educated Guess Cabernet Sauvignon which is so smooth and went beautifully with dinner. We split the 24oz porter house steak. The steak was so delicious. To use the sauces would do an injustice to the perfectly cooked cut of meat! They don't have a dessert menu which was a little disappointing. I'm not really an ice cream person and they serve a variety of sundaes.  The service is probably the best I have had in Vegas. The waiters are very attentive and helpful. The prices are very reasonable. I also love that they offer half glasses of wine so I can make my own little flight!",

    "text": "No, No, No! Just No! The food is great the rest is such a shame. This happened about a month ago & I've been forgetting to write a review. Let me start off by saying, I have never ever experienced such horrible service from a waiter. I didn't get the name, but with the note we left on the receipt, I'm sure he knows who he is. Our friends arrived 15 mins early & got a table. A total of five people, one being the birthday girl. We arrived to our guest who reserved the table 15 mins later, & our server starts off by making a joke asking if we're awake! I'm not stupid & I get the smart ass remark, when you break it down, this server is being petty because he's probably trying to turn tables & by waiting on us who arrived 15 mins late, he cannot. I already gave up at this point, & could read this guy hated his life, & I thought, \"douchebag\", but I stuck with it because the birthday girl wanted to stay & have a good time. Things from there went sour real quick..... Continuously we were ignored, we had no silverware to eat our food, (shout out to the nice runners & bussers who helped). The waiter had many tables nearby & yet we weren't a priority...... Why could that be? Discrimination. We didn't get brunch, we didn't get drinks...correction the birthday girl & another got bottomless mimosas that were only filled up once because our server refused to acknowledge us. This server was clearly judging us on being people who he thought were not going to tip well, or because we weren't being expensive enough for him.....Basically to him, we were cheap & not worth his time. We finally spoke to the manager & admitted to our server that we weren't happy.....20 mins later & the managers send out free dessert. Horrible move! We don't want free stuff, we want to be acknowledged & understood, not free handouts to stay quite & compensate for a bad time. We gave the desserts away to the table next to us & still tipped out waiter to let him know his perception of who he thought we were was wrong...... This place has great food & good prices but the service from out waiter & the way management went about the situation was out of this world horrible.",

    "text": "Food:  Everything was family style. - skirt steak which came with chips and a stuffed mushroom - nice flavor. It was ok.  - shrimp with artichokes - the sauce was good but the shrimp were dipped in a weird batter and fried. It did not taste good at all.  - bavette - AMAZING. It had a wonderful, subtle seasoning that I can't place but was delicious. We shared this dish with the table but I'm getting this just for myself next time! - fried spinach salad - refreshing, yummy Asian-y dressing - Mac and cheese - hubby liked it - Portobello fries with aioli - YUM! really tasty. Especially liked the aioli which made the dish  - Pork belly - pass. nothing special  - Avocado toast - So so. Not as good as other places - Berry sundae - shortbread was dry but ice cream was creamy and berries were good. They really need to get a pastry chef.   Ambiance: small, intimate restaurant upstairs above the butcher shop. Way too LOUD. Really hard to hold a conversation with the table and be able to hear. May try to sit outside next time.   Service: absolutely top notch. Ari was our server and he was the epitome of impeccable professionalism. I have not experienced this kind of service in years. He was able to anticipate my needs before I could even open my mouth to ask. He was relaxed, easy going and knowledgeable and funny. It was like dining with an old friend. That's experience!   Location: far for us at the Tivoli Village (about 45 minutes) so not sure when we'd make it here again with so many great places closer to home.",

The service is exceptional and the ambiance is really nice being in Tivoli Village. We love sitting on the balcony overlooking the fountain. With all that being said, I think their prices are really fair. Just an all around great place for dinner or any kind of celebration.",

We came in casual brunch time and luckily got a great slit to eat on the upstairs deck.    Everyone in our group got the short rib hash which was amazing.  I would highly recommend this dish to anyone. You get tons of food for a good price as well.  Unfortunately I can't really comment about any of the other dishes since everyone in our group of 5 got the hash.  We did get the avocado toast and they have some bacon too which were both really good.   If it's brunch time and it's a beautiful day out I highly recommend coming here and getting the hash. I'm sure their other dishes are good as well but you gotta try the hash you love it I guarantee it.",

I had the pork chops which was 8/10. My mom had the Sea Bass which she liked. To finish off our meal, we had the Caramel Turtle Ice Cream that was 10/10.

The food was fantastic and the service was even better. They had lots of yumminess on the menu so we agreed to share so we could try a few different things. We started with the Maryland crab cake. It was delicious with plenty of crab meat. We also had the avacado toast with shishito peppers. The main event was the short rib hash. Everything was excellent and they were not stingy with the bottomless mimosas. The staff was constantly checking on us and the manager came by a couple of times as well.   They have an amazing butcher shop as well. I didn't buy anything though since we were out and about and I wasn't going to be home for a bit.

First time trying this cut and it'll be my go to when I'm here, period.  My wife ordered the Bavette, it was rock solid as well.  My wife did say that it was a little small (though she was full after) and that she wished she had ordered it medium, instead of medium well. We also went with the \"can't go wrong\"  portobello fries and the \"our first try\" calamari. As I said with the steak, we'll probably stick with these our next time...solid!  Lastly, the service...it was on point. Austin and the rest of the staff did a great job serving our table.  This is our #1 spot for steak in town for a reason!",

After hearing several people tell me about the happy hour between 3pm and 6pm, my friends wanted to check this place out.  This special is only offered at the bar area.  There are 3 food items (steak and eggs for $1.99, shrimp cocktail for $1.99 and a hot dog for $1), along with a number of beer, wine and drink specials.  You don't get a choice on what cuts of steak you get, but our pieces were delicious.  The portions aren't large, but are excellent value for the price.  We came in around 4pm and the place filled up not too long after.  The shrimp cocktail are the small salad style shrimp and is served on a bed of lettuce and the hot dog is almost a full hot dog size.",

The staff is very attentive and is very eager to make your experience as good as it can be. They always show off their cuts of the day if you ask for it and that can bring a stone statue to tears. The steaks are cooked to perfection. Their homemade 7 cheese Mac n Cheese is a must-order appetizer. I also feel like this is a spot that is dominated mostly by locals and that's nice to find. I strongly recommend this to anyone who is a steak lover",

Our waiter was hustling to see to all his tables, which made for a longer wait time, but his expressions, that of a wandering pilgrim in a farmer's bizarre was so entertaining, we didn't care. Next time, I will defn post pictures.   I make my own bone broth. On that note, the butcher said Tuesday's were the best to pick up stock bones. Their meats are specifically chosen for quality, humane practices, and locally sourced. Not to mention, the selection makes a meat gal tingle.",

Selected the two mot popular/best items on the menu: Their Short Rib Hash and Salmon Benedict with Potato Pancakes. Oh. Em. Gee. Savory, delicious... and bottomless mimosa and bloody Mary's to boot!   Ambiance is wonderful. The staff was kind and very attentive. We have to come back when it's Fall since we so badly wanted to sit on the patio outside to enjoy the views but it was over 100 out that day!  One of our favorite brunch places so far in Vegas. Only downside: if you're there on a Saturday they have a bit of a Farmers Market going on... if you had more than 2 mimosas steer clear because you will end up purchasing things you would have never purchased sober. (*My fault entirely.)",

I had one vodka tonic and bartenders are very careful to measure out exactly one shot of vodka and no more. My Spencer cut Steak was tough and gristly but the waitress brought me a filet promptly that was much better--but overall the steaks are too salty. My son got the ribeye cap and said it was great. Steaks came with chips done well and a single button stuffed mushroom that was ok if a little salty.  We got a cesaer and a chopped salad--good thing we each got one because they were not huge.  Swimming in dressing.  Desert was berries and shortcake with ice cream.  Pretty good but desserts always are.  Ice cream was unremarkable. Very loud. I'd give 2.5 stars.  Overall rating was Meh.  Great service extremely average food. It was cheaper than Ruth's Chris but in the end I got what I paid for. $168 for two people including tip. I would not go back.",

The hostess made a note that it was our first time dining there, and that it was a special occasion.    We got there about 15 minutes early and they welcomed us, wished my son a happy birthday and seated us right away.    The Restaurant Manager, Lisa, and our Server, Ari came out together and introduced themselves, welcomed us and also wished my son a happy birthday.  I felt they made the effort to understand our evening, and treated us exceptional.    The food was astounding- the sides are decent portions and the filet mignon and spencer cuts were top notch.   If you have room - which my teenage boys did, you should order one of their homemade sundaes.  I had a bite, and that was also off the chains.    We will definitely return.  Was a great experience and a great value for my money.    Thank you!",

Outdoors was perfect! There weren't any tables available outside, but they were able to set two tables for our party of 4 in no time!  Next, our server, Hugo, presented us with the menu! He gave a great presentation of the different cuts of meat, gave suggestions for food pairings, and provided details about items we wanted to know more about. We wanted to order the entire menu!! This just means we'll be back soon for more! I have to say Hugo provides excellent service. Our glasses were never empty!   I ordered the Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions, pork belly, and the Rib-eye Cap. For dessert we shared the Cappuccino sundae. Everything was delicious!

The grass fed wagyu was absolutely amazing, and so is the fried portobello (honestly it was all tasty)! Our server Lucas was phenomenal. He took the time to talk to us, and give us great service, but wasn't over barring. The manager Beth was also wonderful! She came over, talked with us. and was super friendly.

The outside crust was not done right and the service was subpar with our server non attentive and even a bit passive aggressive. Perhaps it was because my partner and I were dressed casually in a tee shirt and jeans but with the bill hovering around $160 I still expected good service.  The fried calamari is dismissible and not fried crispy. The bacon is delicious however and I would recommend their portobello fries. It's just disappointing that their steak was cooked wrong and rather tasteless. Perhaps it was the thickness of the cut, but it's still surprising considering that's their main offering. Will likely not be coming back or recommending others to dine here. The venue and bathrooms are nice though.",

They have a butcher shop in house, in which you may purchase cuts of meat to take home as well.   There isn't a single item on their menu that doesn't sound amazeballs.

The same day I called the Manager to let him know about my experience, I left a message and until this day I'm waiting for a call back or an apology.

I have never felt more special at a dining experience; not only do they do an excellent job at explaining dishes, they allow you to dine and enjoy your evening out.  We started with: COCKTAILS: \"HOT MESS\" - absolutely terrific. Nice spice and not too sweet.   APPETIZERS: Crab cake - one crab cake; excellent flavor, could have been served slightly warmer.  Bacon - what they are known for and fantastic!!! Served with house-made bbq sauce but not needed; bacon is delicious, almost better, alone. Cauliflower - I hate all veggies but I could eat this. Nice sweet and spicy notes :)  ENTREES: Horseradish butterfish- best meal of the evening!  Cooked perfectly and delicious flavor.  New York strip - excellent marbling and cooked to a perfect medium rare (closer to rare)  Horseradish cream sauce- had to ask for seconds; could have drank it!  Extra good with the homemade potato chips.   SIDE NOTE: NO CORKAGE FEE!!!!!!  Overall: Service made me feel as if I was royalty. Ramone was THE BEST; hands down would request him in the future!!!!! Most definitely coming back :)",

    "text": "A good steakhouse in the 'burbs is rare, so Echo and Rig can easily lay claim to being one of the best. Located in the perennially empty Tivoli Village, the modern, open two-story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second.   The menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates. The best of the bunch might be the portobello fries ($9.80) with their crispy, crunchy fried exterior. If you like fried foods, try the lamb cigars ($8.10) too. A thin, crispy egg roll-like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce. Less successful was an excessively oily gratin ($5.90) full of caramelized onions, roasted pumpkin squash, sage and gruyere. You may want to avoid the steak tartare ($8.10) as well. Not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there, the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing.   Craving a salad? They've got some good ones, like a kale salad ($8) with baby yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts, goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette. If you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share.  As for main entrees, the Spencer steak ($27.70) is a solid choice. It's a prime grade, center cut rib eye that had a modest amount of charring and a savoriness that was enhanced by their mushroom sauce -- a rich and earthy accompaniment that surpassed their other complimentary sauces.  Brussels sprouts are all the rage these days, and their version ($8.10) was enhanced with pistachios that added a nice crunch and salinity to the dish. Even better was a grilled summer corn ($5.90) dish showcasing a char and smokiness that reminded me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill, but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth.  Not to be overlooked is their butcher blend burger ($12.40) - a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket. Topped with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and the optional sharp cheddar cheese, it's a simple burger that's well proportioned and executed beautifully.  They don't have a kid's menu, but were happy to strip down their roasted chicken sandwich ($12) to accommodate my son's tastes -- chicken and cheese on ciabatta.  Prices are reasonable for their location and while it's on the higher end of the spectrum of what suburbanites may want to pay off strip, the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners.",

We had a nice large party dinner here and the ease of coordinating with their large group sales was very easy and efficient.  Since they were so busy our servers though very very friendly and attentive tried to buy as much time as possible with serving the food which was delayed.  The portions were a bit on the smaller size but the quality and flavors of their steaks (tomahawk), roasted chicken and salmon met our expectations.  Side salads also small on portions but big on flavor.  Best dessert was the caramel turtle sundae!!!  Everyone enjoyed the meal but left feeling not full-filled.  We'd probably return on a smaller scale individually, seems like a better way to get bang for your buck.",

    "text": "Admittedly, I was leery of brunch at a steakhouse, but Echo & Rig was one of the better (non-Vegas strip) brunches I can remember. Fantastic service and affordable prices.  Because it was gorgeous October weather, my +1 and I sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. Apparently prime brunch time in Las Vegas starts later than it does in San Francisco. It was around 11 am and we were one of the few tables occupied. It makes sense, since nightlife in Sin City doesn't really get going until 11 pm... guess that means the locals sleep in a bit more?   There's an actual brunch menu, which has plenty of gourmet options to choose from. However, I was feeling adventurous and ordered a Drunken Goat sandwich (goat cheese, brie, herbs de Provence, green apple) with a special request: a sunny side egg on top. It was the best of both worlds, the perfect midday meal.   Quite possibly the best part? Our server let me order one blueberry pancake at half the price of the regular dish. If you asked a server the same thing in SF, they'd roll their eyes and make you feel stupid for even trying. One of the many differences between these two cities. Vegas wins in the customer service department for sure!  The total bill for two people was less than $50, which was amazing. I forgot what food costs outside of the expensive 7x7 confines of San Francisco, too. So this is how the other half lives, huh? So jealous.  Worth the drive out to Summerlin for sure. Great food, nice view, free parking, and I appreciate our server accommodating my random requests.",

It was the first time I've come with my 9 month old and he was sweet to her and even brought her a plate of fruit to munch on while we waited for our meal.  Beth, the GM, usually swings by your table to chat and make sure everything is perfect. She runs the place like you are dining in her home and makes you feel welcome every time you walk in.   They also have a butcher on the first floor which is great. They have a large selection of cuts of grass fed beef, homemade sausages and the butcher is friendly and happy to go over all of their offerings. Definitely swing by there to grab some delicious meat for your weekend BBQ.   This is our favorite brunch place. We love taking all of our friends and family members here when they are in town.

My Wife had scallops that were seared perfectly and very tender, I had the New York Strip Steak cooked to a nice medium-rare. The steak came with a small handful of very tasty garlic potato chips and a stuffed mushroom. Though we didn't, I would suggest ordering one of the vegetables/sides to supplement two meals, my steak was large enough I didn't have to have anything else but the added variety/option may have been nice.  Considering the prices at other steak houses this place was very reasonably priced and between two entrees and a shared dessert we were out the door for the same as can be spent on one single steak elsewhere. And its not for lack of quality, my steak was tender and easily cut, and cooked spot on.   We had a fantastic dinner and would happily come back again and be happy to recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "While I regularly use their butcher shop, I never actually eat in the restaurant, so this was our first time eating there. The main course, New York cut and Filet Mignin were great. It was great prepared perfectly. The appetizer (mushroom soup) was not so good, but that can happen. Only reason why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is due to the fact that the place was extremely noisy. We set inside and it was really difficult to have a conversation. If you're in for a quiet or a romantic dinner this is certainly not the place for you.  Another point to mention, which was key for us selecting the place, is the no-cork fee and the fact that many of the tables brought their own wine. The restaurant promotes that and even  provides a decanter if requested.",

Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  He explained the menu in detail and really went beyond my expectations.  We all had our individual steaks and they were perfectly cooked.  The taste was awesome.  We also had various appetizers and sides and they were really good as well.  At the end of the night, when the bill came, we were all surprised at how much the entire meal cost.. $330s.  This was after spending $750 at Raku the night before.  Obviously, different styles of cuisine, but nonetheless, shows there are affordable delicious food in Vegas if you put in the effort to look around.",

They have a butcher shop to buy cuts of meat to cook at home, and the butchers are super helpful and knowledgeable. I've asked many questions about recipes over the phone as well as in person and they are always extremely accommodating. Xavier has always greeted me with a smile and hug, ever since my 1st few visits. Beth is also a Mgr and is so welcoming and friendly to all of my guests that they ask me, \"How often are you here?\" because she makes them feel as welcome as regulars. At the bar, Carlos is great at mixing drinks and even better at smiling and remembering you. It's never an atmosphere where you are begging to order a drink from a sassy bartender. The price is reasonable and the quality is great. This place is my go to and all the friends I bring here love it as well. Would give more stars if I could.",

(This isn't an Italian restaurant and they quite obviously specialize in steaks) For dessert we had the seasonal sorbet & berries, apple pie & the caramel turtle. ALL AMAZING. Will definitely be back soon. The service was also extremely great, everyone was so kind and helpful. If you're looking for more than a meal, go here.. It's a great experience.",

Sam and Ramon are both knowledgable and professional servers, and the bussers/assistants are friendly and attentive. Even the butchers downstairs thanked us on the way out! And the food!!! I've had the ribeye cap both times and couldn't be more pleased. It came perfectly cooked and seasoned and the server even brought me back to take a look at the open grill where it's cooked wth California red oak. The kitchen was clean and organized and even the back of house staff was welcoming and friendly. All the steaks come with house chips and a stuffed mushroom and they'll bring a variety of sauces. I personally love the Demi, the charred onion, and the blue cheese. Then you pick and choose small plates, vegetables or starches to accompany your meal, family style.  Great selection of beer, wine and cocktails , and small but sweet selection of desserts with housemade ice cream and sorbets. What a great experience. Service and menu have not disappointed, and I look forward to my next visit.",

Everything sounded amazing and I will definitely have to come back to try some of the other items.   We got the rainbow salad (grains, nuts and veggies). It was outstanding. So simple and clean. Could have used a little more salt. We got the grilled octopus. The flavors and other components of the dish were uber delicious, but the octopus itself was overlooked, chewy and burned in some places. There was a small completely charred tentacle in there that looked like a rat tail... gross. Had the butter fish, which was cooked perfectly. It was amazing, but the sauce broke and we were surprised that it was still served to us like that. Lastly, the charred peas, which were a nice side dish, although a little boring.   I feel like this place could be epic. It has all of the right things, the execution is just a little off.   Lastly, the heater outside on the terrace was intense. Recommendation to management to maybe put the setting a little lower.",

Down stairs they have the bar where you can get really decently priced cocktails starting at about $8 which is great since most bars have speciality drinks starting at $12 and up. They do offer happy hour but there are only three food items on the menu so we never tried it. They have a retail store where you can buy products they use in the restaurant, and a butcher shop to buy fresh meats. There's also only one bathroom in the place and it upstairs in the dining area. There is also outdoor patio seating that looks our into the fountain of tivoli village. They also seem to have a juice bar where you can order fresh pressed juices.   Side plates are on the smaller side so don't expect to get full off of those. Which is good because it saves your appetite for the main course.   Items ordered:  Appetizers: Portobello Fries: The best portobello fries that I have ever had! The waiter swears by them. The breading they use is not bread crumbs like we expected. Instead it was a smooth outer shell with a nice crunch to it. The mushroom was cooked perfectly on the inside and not mushy, underdone or burned. The aioli that comes with it for dipping is just the perfect mixture to compliment this fry.   asparagus and a fried egg: came with I believe about 4-5 pieces of  asparagus with an over easy egg on top of it.   Maryland lump crab cake: about 3-4 pieces on this plate. Pretty good  Entrees: Bavette: good piece of meat not to fatty.   black spaghetti pasta: delicious! The broth/sauce was so good that I had to slurp it with every bite! A good serving portion and didn't taste overly fishy. I was a little skeptical ordering this because of the squid ink but it was delicious.",

    "text": "In one visit, Echo & Rig has become a place I cannot afford to miss whenever I visit Las Vegas.  As soon as you enter, you'll see the place is unique, with a large butcher counter and organic juice bar on the floor level. The people behind the counters are smiling and engaging and are happy to tell you anything and everything about the sumptuous foods they're preparing. That includes where it came from as well as recipes for the specific cut you want.  Upstairs, via stairs or elevator, is the restaurant and kitchen. The kitchen is open for everyone to see with about a dozen cooks who really know their stuff. When I visited, the co-owners/head chefs, Frank & Sam, were both there and I got to meet them. They are genuinely nice guys. So nice in fact, they served us a complimentary lamb porterhouse steak, which wasn't even on the lunch menu! This was after I told them I came all the way from Los Angeles to try their lamb. It was so good, I nearly cried.  All the food is delicious, we tried things from every portion of the menu: Portobello mushroom fries, burrata (cheese), charcuterie plate (assorted pates and deli meats), pepper fries, arugula salad, cauliflower with spices, the hanger steak sandwich (super good!), and even some of their ice cream desserts. EVERYTHING is made from scratch including all sauces, breads, deli meats, and desserts. They are primarily a butcher shop, so you can expect the highest quality of meat compared to anywhere. Their signature cut of beef is the hanger steak, which is not easy to get at most places because a single cow only yields a few ounces of it. Yet E&R has it at the ready AND at a good price.  The service is good, it's much like fine dining with a team of very courteous people flying around the table, each with their designated tasks. The thing that will win you over is the value. You get the same (if not better) food quality you would expect from a place like Spago or Mastro's, but it's half the price. YES, HALF.  If there has to be a negative, it's that it's a ways off of the Vegas Strip. About 15 miles (20 min) separates E&R from your favorite Strip hotel, but in light of that, there's a valuable thing I learned by going here. The best food you can find in any city is intended for local customers, NOT tourists. So get away from the sparkly lights and overpriced, mediocre buffets and taste something so good, it might bring tears to your eyes!",

    "text": "I had heard some really good comments about this place from my friends and was very much looking forward the evening. I called ahead for reservations thinking Saturday night would be a busy night. It was even busier than I thought. Reservations or not, we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table and watched someone who walked in 5 minutes after us get seated before us.....(?) One wonders when they set their reservation for.  Upon being seated, I saw a table open on the patio and inquired about it. We were told that table is not available and took our seats where the young lady sat us. About 5 minutes later a couple of ladies were seated next to us and when I looked over 5 minutes later they were not there anymore. Well, I think you can guess where they were sitting now.....yup, the very table I had asked about. No good for us, but fine for them.........  I will say the waiter was pleasant. All business, but when you show up on Saturday night at the time we did, you have to understand the balancing act. He did a good job while still maintaining his pace. I can appreciate this kind of waiter as my family owned a restaurant for 72 years. Kudos, Sam.  Cocktails were fine, nothing special, but definitely drinkable. Still, when making a mojito, please just bruise up the mint. The idea is just to release the oil to infuse the drink, smashing it until it crumbles will insure every sip is filled with broken mint leaves. (this was one of their specialty drinks?)  Appetizers were fine (we ordered three), but once again, not especially praiseworthy. The portabella fries were good enough for a mention, though. Crisp and tasty, I might have to try making them myself.  Entrees......this is where a so-so experience totally fell apart. We ordered our steaks medium, we like pink throughout, but not raw or cooked to ash. Our steaks arrived and one cut determined they were still 85% raw. Seared less than 1/4 inch outside and completely undone inside. Japanese call this tataki and if I had ordered that, it would have been fine, but I did not. We called the waiter and he immediately took them back and said that he would have them cooked to order. When they came back, they were charcoal.  Since the waiter was not the one who brought them back, I don't hold him responsible. He knew what we had ordered and I am sure if he had seen them, he would not have brought them out to us. Another member of his team brought them and one look told us all we needed to know. Still, we cut them to check; leather and brown all they way through, ash on the outside. I like char, but this was two fine pieces of meat ruined beyond eating.  It needs to be said that Echo and Rig is a butcher shop and their specialty is meat. Hmmmm?  Curiously, and this may not have anything to do with anything, but I wonder what kind of grill they use since there was no cross-hatching on the steaks. Since they sell books on grilling and have charcoal also for sale, doesn't that mean they cook over open flame with wood, too?  We called the waiter and said politely that we were done here and could he bring us the check. I told him I would not pay for the steaks, but that I was willing to pay for everything else. He apologized and tried what he could to fix the situation, but one little thing after another ending with this total fail was enough for us. He called the manager Derrick and he also apologized and said he would like a chance to fix the evening, so invited us back another time and made sure his fellow manager Xavier was aware of our situation.  I'm not sure we will take them up on the offer, but the fact that they offered was appreciated. Thank you gentlemen and kudos to our waiter, Sam. (I hope I got your name right, because I'm trying to forget this experience)  Still, until we give them another try (read \"if\" here), I cannot give them anything other than the \"one star\" that this experience was. Sorry guys maybe next time?",

    "text": "I want to give 4 1/2 stars but I can't.  I really like this place and am adding it to my rotation of places good enough to go back that fit my budget.  Echo & Rig is a butcher shop/restaurant.  Just walking past the window into the butcher area made me salivate, craving a good steak.  We entered and were greeted by the butcher, the manager (maybe even an owner?) and several other employees.  The hostess was very friendly and one of the chefs brought us a prosciutto appetizer with a little pork belly slider while we waited. (this does not seem like a typical thing so don't expect it.)  There is a small bar that was crowded for a Thursday and a small appetizer bar that served the charcuterie plate, sausage plate and a few other items.  We were seated upstairs where our waiter Brian explained the menu to us.  The menu consists of small plates (appetizers or sides or combine a few to make a meal) and steaks.  Unlike the traditional steak restaurants that focus on NY and Ribeye and Filet, Echo has a wide selection of variety steaks like Spencer Steak (essentially a boneless Ribeye without the cap), Ribeye Cap, Hanger, Flatiron and more.  You can also get the traditional steaks.  I enjoy the pick your own sauce option and was extremely glad when the sauce came as a side so I could decide how much to put on.  I asked for the flatiron steak medium rare.  The service took a long time and in afterthought, I would have them bring the portobello fries (portobello mushroom, lightly breaded and fried with an amazing aioli.) as an appetizer so we didn't feel like the wait was long.  Brian was very attentive in an old school waiter type way, remembering my name, ushering me to the restroom when I had to go, and making sure our water was filled.  Sparkling and flat water are available gratis (FREE).  One of the best parts of this place is the price - portion ratio.  The Flat Iron Steak runs at $17.00 and is a 7 oz portion. (Note, they can make a Ribeye as large as 64 oz if you really must eat that much).  One of my biggest complaints about the traditional steakhouses is the steaks are usually 12-16 oz.  I almost never finish them and I cannot think of anything else that is so easily ruined by overnight refrigeration and reheating than a good medium rare steak.   Here, the 7 oz was just enough to fill my tummy and not make me feel overstuffed.  We also loved the Asparagus and fried egg appetizer and the Spencer Steak.  So why not 5 stars you ask?  1) Presentation was boring. Essentially steak on a plate surrounded by some potato chips. I don't need fancy but there was a pile of chips on the left side of my plate, the steak in the center and about 1/3 the plate empty on the right. and 2) the service time was long as the place did not seem very crowded.  Some other interesting facts about Echo & Rig are 1) you can bring your own wine with NO CORKAGE FEE!!!! and 2) they make their own ribeye jerky.  Even their glass prices for wine are reasonable.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "5 stars for service but 4 stars for food.   Ok, overall I loved this place. I really appreciate a good ambiance and this was definitely a good one.   I ordered the skirt steak. You get to pick a sauce (or 2 or 3) and I chose the red wine Demi. The steak was done perfect and the sauce was phenomenal. The only thing I didn't really love was the steak was very sweet on its own. It must have been the marinade that goes on the steak. Paired with the red wine Demi, it was way too sweet, and I like sweet. So I ended up opting for the bernaise sauce because for the most part, it cut the sweetness.   We got portobello fries and calamari for an appetizer and those were both done perfectly.   We also received a free sundae of our choice for our moms birthday, it was a very nice dessert for being complimentary.   The service is great. She checked on us just enough times that it wasn't overwhelming but it wasn't too sparse. Our drinks were always full and they always offer more bread and butter.   I would definitely go back but might try a different steak that maybe wouldn't have that sweet marinade.",

    "text": "Hello Echo Echo & Rig.  We finally get a taste of what the buzz is all about. We knew that they took no reservations, but coming in at 6pm on a Saturday night (which we thought was early), we didn't expect to have to wait over one and a half hours for our table.  It was chaos up front.  And the hostess was polite, but lacking a sincere warmth.  Good thing we loaded up with wine and tapas next door.  If you detest waiting, come at an odd hour.  If you don't, then be patient to get a table, and even more patient for the food to arrive.   The restaurant is beautiful... tall ceilings, beautiful meat greeting your appetites at the door, and a masculine but comfy bar to wait, load up and people watch.  When your table is finally ready, you get whisked upstairs to a gorgeous space that wraps around a whimsical chandelier.  It's one of those great hangouts for a hot date or the whole family because any baby cries would be drowned out by the noise of the crowd.  There is also a well-heated dining balcony area for fans of the outdoors or cigarettes.   Get to the food woman!  Ok ok, were they worth all the wait?  It was quite divided at our table.  Were the cocktails fabulous?  Yes.  The food was good, but I'm not sure I'd like to wait that long for steak I can get elsewhere without a wait.  Eeep, but that's the truth.   We did enjoy the food.  We had the portabella mushroom fries with herb aioli (definitely a must-try), the Bibb salad with radicchio blue cheese and balsamic dressing (a great pair up with the meat), the Sea Bass a la Plancha which comes with an olive-oil sauce (nothing else), the lamb chops with a wee bit potatoes and apricots, and finally the rib-eye steak which come with 1 quite bland stuffed mushroom and pretty good potato chips.   I love how they organized the menu - steaks, salad, small plates divided into price categories.  All of which I am pretty sure will please any palette and wallet.  But my biggest beef with the main entrees is (and I am a petite woman who enjoys sushi) the main meals itself are a little lacking... either in weight or side dish pairings.  Make my meat cuts larger, or give me more substantial sides with my main entree, and I will be one happy camper... who will still order your small plates.  I promise.   That night the servers told us they had introduced 20 new items to the menu which were causing delays in the kitchen.  This restaurant is still working out its kinks, but overall, we had a good dining experience.  Definitely try it out and gauge for yourself if it deserves a repeat.",

    "text": "So I came to Echo And Rig on the suggestion of my friend Kilan, a butcher in the butcher shop that inhabits the first floor of this amazing restaurant. When you come thru the door, the first impression you get is the culture of happiness that permeates the staff. It's like the Zappo's of steakhouses. From the hostesses to the servers and chefs, everyone exudes such pleasantness and just an excitement to be in the building. My party of 8 (which was supposed to be 14 which they accommodated with a great table by the open kitchen) was seated quickly and the server Sam greeted us with a broad smile. A litany of amazing appetizers followed (pictures to follow) and Kevin the runner kept our sparkling and still water glasses full the entire night. The chef, Ben stopped by the table and greeted us, inquiring about the food and how we enjoyed it. THEN, a lovely woman greeted us from the kitchen, informing us she was our griller for the evening. Jeannine was sweet and her smile never left her face! It made me confident I was in for an amazing treat! A tray was brought to the table with two beautiful Tomahawks and a porterhouse to die for, and we chose our steaks.  Now , at this point, I surveyed the atmosphere in the restaurant and watched the staff, bustling back and forth. Even when they thought no one was observing them, they greeted each other warmly and we're even smiling to themselves!  The steaks and other entrees arrived and were the picture of perfection. Cooked with almost obsessive precision, there were moments I lost myself and closed my eyes and savored the greatness. Then our desserts were various ice cream creations that were demolished so quickly, I couldn't get pictures! My favorite was the Apple Pie Sundae.   Overall, the genuineness of the staff, the skill of the chefs and the experience made my birthday dinner a success, I will be repeating and very soon! Where else am I going to find a restaurant with a delicious Viognier and a warmth that isn't overbearing, but simply and obsessively delightful. I've been in the restaurant and bar business for over a decade, and Echo And Rig should put  on a manual on what a five star, five diamond experience IS!",

I can honestly say for the quality of food, the price, and the environment there is no way I can rate this place any lower than 5 stars. The pricing is incredibly reasonable for this type of setting. The coffee offered for $2 compared to $3.50 over at other deplorable spots like \"Egg and I\" or \"Eggtastic\" is reason alone to come back. Not to mention incredible service, knowledgable waiters and waitresses, and farm fresh ingredients. You would be stupid not to make this your \"go-to\" restaurant for brunch.  Now for dinner...having a restaurant and butchery mixed into one can be a little \"dicey\", but they make it work. I thoroughly enjoyed the Spencer steak reasonably priced in the $20-$30 range depending on if you want a la carte sauces and sides. They categorize their sides into 3 sections, each category based off price. We had the Mac 'n' Cheese and Sweet Potato, both being perfectly portioned for multiple people and extremely tasty.  Overall, everything here is fresh, literally tastes like everything is picked from a garden behind the building. I love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to feel rich within a reasonable budget.",

    "text": "From the food to the service, this place is AMAZING. This is the only restaurant that has left that kind of impression on me. Our waiter (I missed his name because I went to the restroom lol) was very helpful and explain the whole menu to us. It was our first time, so it's nice when they take the time to explain the menu rather than say \"everything is good here\". For our starters, we had the portobello fries-which is how I want my fries from now on, steak tartare-so yummy!, and the bone marrow carne asada-best one I've had! For our entrees, I had the spencer steak and it was cooked perfectly! I couldn't finish it all, but I wish I did.   One of the things that really stood out to me was the service. Our waiter was very helpful and really sweet. The manager, Sam was very attentive. I went with my boyfriend and his friend, both of them are Le Cordon Bleu graduates, and when his friend asked about possibly staging there, Sam actually went and asked rather than just brushing it aside. We even met the butcher I believe and he talked to us during our meal!   I would definitely be coming back again. This restaurant is doing EVERYTHING right.",

    "text": "Echo & Rig you cannot go wrong here with the food, I have dined several times and sat in the bar area and had appetizers. Sometimes the bar service can be spotty if you are seated at a table, but the food always makes up for service, and other times the service is excellent.  My last three meals I have had the hanger steak and it never disappoints, it is flavorful and tender, in fact my Mom who had ordered the filet regretted her choice. The fried Portabella mushrooms are a favorite and always disappear quick. My meal came with Mushrooms Rockefeller and were wonderful. I can no longer eat gluten so many of these sides I need to scrape of the toppings but I will not hold my dietary limitations. The dessert we had an assortment of sorbets and they were outstanding. Our waiter overheard it was our birthday and delivered it with a candle and a great smile. He was attentive for our needs and was a great server, I wish I remembered his name. He was Latin and worked May 9th.  The dining room with its marble floors and high ceilings can be a little noisy. We requested to sit outside and they were able to accommodate us and it was absolutely wonderful. The setting is beautiful and weather permitting, it will be my first choice.  I also love their wine list, be sure to check it out online, it is not only extensive, but there are many options including ordering a half glass and I appreciate this when I am trying new wines or do not want a full glass. Very nice touch. I also love they have an great selection of sides, one can graze and be very satisfied.  Echo and Rig has figured it out, blending high end dining to keeping the cpst reasonable with their options and always having great food!",

For most Americans it may feel like the service was slow. However, I found it to be refreshing to be able to sit and talk and enjoy our wine without feeling like we were being pushed to order and get out. The location in Tivoli is also amazing. Take a walk after dinner. You're bound to find a live band playing at a local establishment. Enjoy!",

I even stopped by the butcher shop to take some goodies home for the hubby. The highest quality food at a very responsible price. The service was also outstanding both times. For brunch I highly recommend the smoked salmon Benedict and a bloody mary for brunch and for dinner the skirt steak, the ribeye cap, the butterfish, the mac & cheese, the cauliflower....I could go on and on!!! I've already made my reservation for Easter brunch. I can't wait to go back!!!!!!",

    "text": "I was very impressed with this restaurant in every detail.  We came to Vegas for a girl's weekend retreat. Side note: Echo and Rig are individuals from Greek Mythology...  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and then brought up the stairs to be seated. I mentioned to the hostess it was my friends birthday. Soon after we sat down, the manager Xavier, greeted us & welcomed us to the restaurant.  He also wished my friend a happy birthday! He was down to earth and very attentive.  He even almost photo bombed us later in the evening, haha.  Our waiter Alpheus was superb.  He spent all the time we wanted answering questions and patiently explaining the menu to us. He even answered our questions/gave us tips about the area attractions, since we aren't local.  He would give us attention and help when we wanted, and would leave when we did not need more assistance.  (He didn't linger too long) He had a huge smile & professional attitude, and clearly enjoys his job and is proud of the restaurant.  The food was exquisite!!!! I had the pumpkin soup to start and it was delicious.  It had Carmelized onions and pumpkin morsals with some type of crispy on the outside crouton. It was also covered with delicious melted mozzarella.  For dinner I had the filet tenderloin with house potato chips and a mushroom rocker fella.  The steak was cooked to perfection and so tender. (Medium rare). I had a lovely mushroom sauce to go with it.  The chips were light and crunchy with a nice garlic salt flavor, and the mushroom rocket fella was superb.  For texture eaters, this place is Divine! The rocker fella consisted of a mushroom stuffed with bacon, crispy crumbs, and some type of filling. It was soft and crispy and crunchy... Yum! My friend shared with me her cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, which were so soft and fluffy (as opposed to the usual starchy rough mashed potatoes at restaurants).  To end, my friend was given her choice of a birthday Sunday, and she chose the caramel turtle ice cream. The ice cream was rich and sweet, filled with candied nut morsels that were absolutely wonderful.  The speed in which we got our food was fast! The attentiveness and teamwork of the staff was very impressive. If a waiter dropped a receipt, the manager immediately noticed and picked it up.  If a waiter didn't get bread to a table in a timely manner, another waiter would notice and tell him or do it for them.  Everyone was friendly, helpful and attentive.  Each time we needed more drink, or finished a plate, there was always someone there filling up our drinks, or taking away dirty dishes.  This was by far the best restaurant we went to in Vegas.  The service was above and beyond, the price of the items were not bad at all, the food was outstanding with such mouth watering flavors and textures!  Overall, the quality of this restaurant was impeccable! The ambience was also nice... Modern decor and such a beautiful, classy, romantic atmosphere.",

They have some uncommon cuts off beef that are hard to find. Try the ribeye cap, it's the soft, super marbled part of the standard ribeye edge that tastes the best. I don't agree with the complementary sauce on the side, really good steak does not need a sauce, and it should be omitted. The steaks are cooked perfectly, and should not be ordered above medium-rare. Bonus for wood grilled steaks on red oak, really great pairing with beef and you can subtly taste the oak flavor.",

Greeted like you we're regular..   We didn't have reservations so I decided to chat with the butcher about what they had to offer. The butcher was informed and let me know that all meat available for sale or in the restaurant is grass fed.. Also mad another point that they don't purchase meat from ranches that don't butcher on there site otherwise there isn't any guarantee that the meat was grass fed before being butchered.. I was interested in smoking a whole pig so she took down my info so the head butcher could contact me with details.. Was please a few days later Aaron called let me know they just need about a weeks notice and they can get almost any meats!!   As for dinner...",

I was upset our dinner party was so crappy and we paid $35 for entrees and $10+ for sides. And they charged us 20% gratuity after not sitting us together. To top it off, the manager brought me the wrong change. I told her and that was corrected. Overall, the service was slow, and it took us over 2 hours from first sitting to paying our bill.",

Our waiter was unfortunately a little aggressive with the food and drink. He was pouring our waters  and drinks and spilled a bunch of water all over the table. When our food came out, he was scrambling to place the plates down because he had a lot.   I had to have the steak since I am a huge steak person. GREAT STEAK! Great FOOD in general! When you're with great company eating great food with a great VIEW on the patio in Las Vegas, what is there to complain about?

Echo's menu is rather large with items ranging from small plates to enormous tomahawk rib eye steaks.  My party ordered some appetizers/small plates and a bunch of different cuts of steak.  We loved the portobello mushroom fries.  The steak tarare was excellent with a lovely acidic notes.  Our favorite was defintely the charcuterie sampler!  The head cheese and pate were so good, I just wanted to order more but there was steak to come... I had the rib eye cap which is basically the rim around the eye of the steak.  Holy smoke, the char on the steak was amazing and perfectly seasoned with ample salt and pepper.  The price tag on these steaks are very reasonable and bar far better tasting than any of the $$$$ steakhouses on the strip.  Too bad this restaurant is such a locals spot, It'd do very excellent on the strip.  Soberts as dessert were excellent to finish off the meal!",

Although I don't have a lot of Yelp write-ups...yet, I have dines at a number of upscale establishments in town.  Max-Props to Xavier (manager) and our \"regular\" server(s) Sam and Julian, capital 'A' Awesome.  I am a fan of servers helping with the food selections and Sam did a fantastic job.  All the dishes were spot on and dining on the upstairs outdoor patio was superb.  ALSO, One of my top reasons for patronizing Echo & Rig is their continuing support of the \"No Corkage\" policy.  Although, they have a nice wine selection, but I do as well, and prefer to bring wines I am positive my wife and I will enjoy.  Hopefully other restaurants will take note and lower or eliminate their corkages fees, some around town are at a totally ridiculous level. (i.e. $35-75)  Enjoy your time here and I highly recommend asking for a table that Sam services.  Cheers!",

If you get the chance, you have to try echo and rig. You will NOT be disappointed and you definitely can't beat the price. $125 for two steaks, two sides, a dessert and tip. You can't go wrong! I'm sorry for my previous review and deleted it. Thank you, for a wonderful experience. You more than made up for our previous experience.",

    "text": "One of the best things about this place is the pricing compared to steakhouses on the on the Strip. Its also a great place in that it's a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!  The service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. Yes to the first, no to the second. But that information was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged that we had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu/food/ect. So there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing.   Now to the food:   Short-rib grilled cheese - Order it! Just do it. It comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. It's savory, flavorful and filling.   Ribeye - I'm not much of a steak eater, but I enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked.   Garlic Chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. They are salty and garlicky and good.   Mac and cheese - pretty standard. Creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. Not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good.   Brocillini - pretty basic, but good.   Lamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. Unique but worth trying. I could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style that I haven't had before.   Baked brie - I'd probably skip next time. I love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. Just wasn't my favorite.   Each of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to what you would pay at a steakhouse on the Strip. The menu is large enough that you could go back several times and never order the same thing. The service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.",

A very nice hostess took us up their elevator (neat!) to our table. It's very pretty inside and I love that you can see into the kitchen. Our server was very nice and went over everything in detail. My husband got the lamb and I got the beef tips, and both were amazingly delicious. It was the best lamb we'd ever had, and the tips just melted in my mouth. Next time we're in Vegas I definitely want to go back and get one of their steaks, as they looked just amazing.

We also ordered bottomless Mimosas which were never refilled, but the champagne and orange juice was sitting right next to our table on ice, so we proceeded to pour ourselves only to have the bottle snatched from my hand and told that it was illegal by this nasty waitress who probably shouldn't be in the customer service industry. I then asked to speak to a manager who came over and offered to buy our drinks which was fine but his apology felt  insincere and scripted. I will definitely never go back to this place or recommend it to anyone. Horrible experience.",

I normally never have an issue with this sort of thing unless I am at a chain restaurant.  Halfway through the ribs, I did not notice any nuts but my mouth was ON FIRE. I had to leave and grab an Epipen. What a horrible experience.  The server had been \"cut\" so I had to explain to the new server and the manager what went wrong. I was not even offered my meal on the house.  Unreal.  Never, ever going back there again.",

I'm a pescatarian, so often times at steakhouses I am forced to choose between a single meat-free pasta dish or a single choice of fish. It's boring. Here there were several fish and other seafood choices. I had the butterfish which was incredible, so I am psyched to return and try some other seafood dishes.   We also had some cauliflower and brussel sprouts on the side, and they were almost as tasty as the mains.   The only part that saddened me was dessert. Nothing was wrong with it, but the selection was a bit thin. They had a variety of different ice cream sundaes, but no cake, pie, tarts, etc. Just a dish of ice cream, no matter how good the toppings, is not as good as a brownie or pastry.",

Drink the Kentucky Peachtree, an amazing cocktail that has a bourbon foundation with a light ginger beer finish; strong enough for man but gentle enough for a lady. Eat: the bacon. I don't think I need to say why but you should probably bring a change of underwear. Also eat the steak, this goes without saying but you'll hate yourself if you eat chicken or fish here...I'm sure its lovely but why? Honestly everything I ate here was wonderful I do think that the desert menu lacks in comparison with the rest of the menu - the Carmel Turtle is the star of the desert menu.",

Now approaching its third year in business, and outlasting concepts from several more 'celebrated' chefs with nearly universal accolades arriving from locals since opening its doors, Echo & Rig pairs the all-too-common farm-to-table concept with in-house butchery in the style of a steakhouse and leveraging the later knowledge of sourcing and artisan cuts to curtail costs the restaurant happily outstrips the likes of nearby Flemming's while retaining a local sort of feel, the two-story building upscale yet extremely comfortable with a feel that is welcoming whether one is seated in a jacket inside or sporting sandals with a glass of wine in hand under misters on the second-floor patio outdoors.  Admittedly known to the restaurant as a result of reaching out to management with questions regarding the concept and thoughts pertaining to the Echo & Rig's longterm success in a complex where little else has thrived, it was on arrival that the party was escorted to a sizeable four-top at the top of the stairs and greeted by a handful of the restaurant's sizable staff the evening started out with a comprehensive rundown of the menu followed by a complimentary plate of housemade charcuterie joining warm bread and butter as cocktails were sipped and an order was put forth.  Served largely by a man named Brian, first described as the restaurant's best waiter and later as a 'brand ambassador,' it was not long after ordering a first course of food that the plates began to arrive and treated to a bowl of crispy cauliflower tinged in spice along with the items that we'd ordered one would be hard pressed to name a single bite that did not shine, the signature Portobello fries probably the weakest of the items as seasoning seemed to obscure more earthy notes while both the housemade sausage and ricotta with fruit and honey were entirely irresistible, the same to be said of vegetables that were simple yet satisfying while the 'grilled cheese' was every bit the crowd pleaser that rumors would contend.  Already questioning an order that proved quite large when accounting for portion sizes and enticing presentations that made it difficult to resist finishing each plate, entrees saw four prime proteins paired to a trio of sides and although the \"Santa Maria Rub\" unfortunately served only to overwhelm one friend's tri-tip, the quality of an enormous pounded pork cutlet and both the Spencer as well as the Cap were undeniable, the sides a bit of a mixed bag with both corn and potatoes pleasant amidst their accoutrements while the Mac & Cheese featuring \"Seven Cheeses\" was nothing more than run of the mill.  Unfortunately short-selling on desserts, an odd choice for a place going so far as to bake their own bread, it was in a duo of sundaes that final bites were invested and although both were well comprised of high quality ingredients one can't help but wonder how much better the experience could be with a dedicated pastry chef, or even a cheese board considering the fact that baked brie is featured amongst the side plates while candied fruits served with the ricotta were also quite good.",

The drinks are a decent price, but their eating items are ridiculous. They only charge two dollars for steak and eggs, but my friend and I ordered four each which is a hassle. I'd rather pay more and have a halfway decent portion the first time. It's not that it's overpriced because obviously $2 is a steal, but it is inconvenient. In fact, they shouldn't call it happy hour they should just call it kids menu (and not elementary school kids, more like toddlers). It's weird that an eatery would even do their happy hour in this style. The shrimp cocktail and everything else on the happy hour menu was the same way. Will not be back for anything but dinner from now on. I suggest you follow my lead! I will still recommend this to anyone looking for a fantastic meal, but I will be sure to emphasize DINNER.",

Everything we tried was amazing! The service however.... A different story. We were not crazy hungry from being out and about all day so we opted for a selection of small plates. Rather than a large steak.... Apparently that is an issue. Our server went from joking and talkative to short and rude. We could literally see him whispering and pointing at our table to the busser and the busser laughing. The manager circled our table staring intently at our selections but didn't actually say a word before walking away....  Service here is very awkward and rude.  I would come back just because the food was so great but never sit in his section again.",

    "text": "I don't visit steakhouses very often so I struggle to compare E&R to others, but I do know when I like a meal.  I ordered the Rib-Eye Cap steak because it says limited quantities.  Now I usually like my steak to be rare, very rare but the server suggested I get this as a medium -- good choice.  It came out perfect.  We got the Brussels Sprouts as our veg and it comes as leaves from the sprout, not as halved pieces.  Very nice.  I can't comment on the dessert since we were too full from the salad, steak, and veg.  One item to note, the drinks are prepared downstairs and brought up sort of en mass, so you might have a slight wait to get you Manhattan. One item that is sort of funny was when the hostess seated us she asked me where I was from and what I did for work: Milwaukee & small manufacturing company.  A few minutes later the manager stopped by to welcome us and mention he know we were in town from Milwaukee.  Tattle-tail hostess. I think this was a fun, classy steakhouse that is affordable since it's nowhere near The Strip.  Stop in and tell the hostess you're a film producer or Justin Bieber's personal pilot and see where it goes from there.  :-)",

We were greeted by friendly hosts who assisted me with the elevator (I had a stroller) and they sat us all promptly. As soon as we sat down Started throwing a tantrum so my husband took him out for a few minutes. In that short span of time our server put in an order of mac n cheese I had requested for and it literally came out perfect just in time. My son loved it and he was instantly calm.  That was the beginning of the awesome service. Throughout our entire meal our server was on point with refills, requests, making sure our meal was perfect. The steaks were awesome!! We had a bigger group so half the group did family style and got the bigger steaks and shared sides. My half of the table ordered our own entrees. Everything was so delicious and I know they are known for their steaks but oh my goodness their pork chop is so good and I will def be going back just for the pork chop!  After paying the bill, I was ready to head to the elevator with my stroller, I saw not one but two staff members both race to the elevator, both trying to hurry and have the elevator ready for me to hop in.

Our table of 6 ordered a variety of menu options, including a massive tomahawk, the Spencer steak, burgers and chicken sandwiches. The food was delicious and very appropriately priced. Service was excellent; prompt, polite and attentive without being obnoxious or overbearing. Good cocktails as well. It was not an inexpensive meal, but your money is well-spent here, as you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a good off-strip steakhouse, E&R will be tough to beat.  My only gripe, and this is minimal, is that they don't accept reservations. We arrived at 7:15 with a party of six and were told that our wait would be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. This makes it very difficult to plan an evening if you're trying to get somewhere on a schedule (e.g., movies). They also have a very non-modern system of table tracking that adds to the unpredictability.  With the great bar and cocktails, this is not a deterrent to return, but I will definitely plan accordingly next time.",

Also, the chef (my bad I have short memory for names) actually explained to us about different dishes. We got the hanger steak (recommended by chef), lamb chop and a spaghetti, appetizers were thick bacon and fried chicken. Started with thick bacon, it has a very fatty flavor, totally what we were looking for, but just better. The fried chicken was awesome, it is crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. My mother in law got the spaghetti ($12 ONLY!) It came with two big scallops and plenty of big shrimps. Very herbal taste and totally worth the price. I got the hanger steak ($22) medium rare, it's very juicy and tender and I enjoyed it a lot. The best thing was my husband's lamb chop ($17). We both agreed that it's the best lamb chop we have ever tasted. I kept trading my steak with his. It's just very flavorful and juicy! If he could i am sure he would totally swallow the bone! We also got to taste the pig's head cheese, it has a very interesting flavor and my husband and I both enjoyed it. It's certainly not something that everyone will like but if you have the courage, try this interesting dish. We are planning to order a roast pig's head when we head over with a bigger group! After all, it was a very enjoyable meal. Price point was very economical and definitely recommend this place.",

We ate there early in the afternoon and we the only ones in the dining room.  There was a party outside and us, thats it.  Our waiter, who i wont name, but his name starts with a DY and ends with an N was our waiter.  He took forever to wait on us, we had to ask to have our waters filled, he served three of the people in the party and left one out and we had to hunt him down to ask for the fourth dinner.  He was pleasant, but very inattentive. After our dinners finally arrived, we asked where the small bites were, he said they are getting them ready now and ran over and got them, they were cold.  We sent them back.  Other than that experience, it is our favorite local steak house.  Service has always been excellent, excluding this yelp review.  One carefree person can wreak havoc on peoples experiences.  Hopefully he will get on board with everyone else in the restaurant.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure.  You know the space is more than a little awkward (looks like it should be a furniture store of clothing boutique).  But it's good, actually really good.  Service?  Good.  Food?  Good.  Management?  Treated us like kings even though we showed up with no rez in our walking clothes and a stroller with baby in it.  Servers were incredibly patient as my wife tortured herself with the overwhelming number of small plate options.  And the ones she chose were pretty good.  And the steak (the Spencer Steak) was excellent.  Best $25 steak I can remember.    This is what we hoped Ogden's would be.  A place worth visiting within walking distance of our house.  I think I'd like this place even if it wasn't within strolling distance, but maybe an extra star for that.  But it's not like it's an easy walk, so don't discount my review.  We gotta head up Oakey and then once we get to Cimaron we can cut through the 'hood.  When we get to Durango it's a bit of risky, more like 'mad', dash across Durango.  Once you've safely navigated (jay walked) to the other side of 6 lanes of stupid, probably drunken, traffic (think frogger with a stroller), you can cut behind the Guitar Center to avoid the inevitability of being flattened by some Kohl's shopping ingrate.  Assuming you make it through that long, dark alley you can take a right to approach Sahara and cross at what should be a protected cross-walk to the Boca Park shopping center, only this is Vegas so you can press the button for the signal (which by design is a really fancy one that in addition to a walk sign and in case you're blind should at some point announce \"WALK SIGN TO CROSS SAHARA\"), which in the last year has never given us a walk sign no matter how many cycles you wait through, but it doesn't really matter anyway because this is Vegas and signs don't matter because it's a 24-hour town and at any time of the day you've got people getting off their shifts and hitting happy hour and driving home drunk and on ambien or loratab, so with your head on a swivel, charge into traffic and cross when you see the left turn arrow and as you get to the other side you will notice a melting pot fondue restaurant, so if you're light on ambien, loratabs or blow you could probably score there as long as the employees haven't gotten too twisted - not on fondue - on that given evening and used up their whole supply.  So now you're basically in the back of Boca Park.  That should be a relief and, if you hit the melting pot fondue restaurant, maybe you're a little \"emboldened\" at this stage of the walk.  It's probably good to be emboldened because now you've got another half-mile, unlighted stretch behind the office max and down a construction road with no sidewalk.  Keep your head on a swivel because occasionally someone leaving cheesecake factory restaurant will come roaring up behind you and because there is no sidewalk you may have to employ some evasive maneuvers to make it to alta where you can ride the sidewalk and enjoy a protected cross-walk into Tivoli Village.  My family enjoys this walk frequently.",

Everything started off fine even though the wait for a table ended up not being the '10 minutes\" they promised but well over 30 minutes. They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait.  Over 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going, then dump food on our table. I say \"dump\" because we had ordered several courses - soups, salad and main dishes and side dishes andmost of it came out at once...other than the soup and a veggie dish, which we then had to wait another 15 minutes for.  How the heck does the soup come out last?! The worst part about it is that most of the dishes were cold.   Rather than serving us dishes as they were ready, it was obvious they waited or forgot about our order for a very long time.  We mentioned our frustration to the waitress in a nice way and she said the kitchen was backed up. Then management pops up while we are still waiting for some of our food and asking how is everything.  We mention having some issues with the wait and he makes a snarky comment rather than apologizing or trying to make things a bit better. We weren't at all rude but he handled it all very badly.   I think the popularity of the restaurant has made management think that it's ok to treat people badly and that they can afford to lose a few customers. I was appalled and will never go back.  It was one of the worst evenings we've had in a long time. We can't suggest anything other than just avoid the place until they work out the service kinks unless you are in the mood to take the risk of really bad and rude service.",

    "text": "I'm sorry but how ANYONE can give this place a bad review is beyond me! I cannot believe I have not tried this place sooner. I am a local so I stay away from most overpriced, overhyped strip restaurants and it is VERY hard to impress me as most restaurants in Vegas unfortunately DO lack in either consistency, service or food quality. But holy freakin moses I was SO impressed here. Took my teenager for a mother/son dinner and we decided to give it a shot instead of going to Cheesecake Factory down the street. SO glad we did! I have NEVER had better service in my life at ANY restaurant here in Vegas. They were on top of everything! I mean they freakin re-fold your napkin anytime you get up, water always filled, fabulous friendly service all around! WONDERFUL! Ricky was our waiter and he was great!!  The food, amazeballs! My son had the rib eye, he ate the whole thing. I had the sole and it was perfect! Side order of the blackened kale, perfect and we had the octopus salad appetizer which holy smokes, was one of the most original, wonderful salads I have ever had. I am originally from Hawaii so I have literally caught and cooked my own octopus and this was just as fresh and good!  Total of my bill including a mojito $77 and worth every penny! Left a benjamin, no change, and they deserved every penny!",

We were also given a special meat sampler (since we were at the Chef's table) and everything was fantastic. Our fish and meats were cooked to perfection. The sides were very tasty. All were very satisfied. The service was great, and kept us rolling since we were going to a cirque show after dinner. Bravo!",

    "text": "This review is only about trying to get seated, not the food - never got a chance to experience that.  Went for a Sunday Brunch around noon and expected there would be a bit of a wait.  You check in and give them you cell # so they can text you when they're ready to seat you.  They don't give you an idea of how long it will be but they \"are turning over the table fairly quickly\".  That response to me was code that it was going to be a long wait...and it was.  Went across the plaza to the Brio and was seated immediately.  After finishing salads, our entrees at the Brio were being served by the time Echo and Rig finally texted.  The food at Brio was excellent and so was the service and the bill for two was probably the same or less than we would have spent at Echo and Rig, just based on the menu prices.  Trendy restaurants think that waiting ridiculous amounts of time to just be seated are the price you pay (on top of overpriced entrees) for the privilege of eating at their establishment.  That may be True for some, but not me.",

In our friend group, there were some that never ate at a steakhouse before, so we were interested to see how they would react.  And I've got to say, my friends and I had an amazing time.  My friends who never ate a steakhouse before loved the place so much that we went back again the next day!  For appetizers, we go the cauliflower, roasted garlic mashed potatoes and white cheddar, grilled thick-cut bacon, lamb cigars, asparagus and fried egg, portobello fries, and bone marrow carne asada.  All the sides were absolutely delicious.  The group favorite and my personal favorite was the bone marrow carne asada.    For main course, I had the Ribeye steak medium rare.  It was cooked to perfection and very juicy and tender.  My friends had the spencer steak and absolutely loved it.    Whenever I come back to Vegas, I have to stop by this place for some steak.",

    "text": "I stopped by Echo and Rig during lunch time on the weekend.  My server informed me that only brunch was being served, and that their regular menu is available at dinner times and on weekday lunches.  I really wanted to have a steak as I heard so much about their meats.  She talked to the kitchen and they were able to accommodate my request.  I went with the Spencer Steak.  Spencer Steak ($29) - A Spencer steak is a 10oz. boneless rib eye.  Naturally I asked for my steak to be prepared medium rare.  All their steaks are cooked over red oak.  Some garlic chips and sauteed spinach accompanied my dish.  The steak tasted pretty good and was closer to being rare then medium rare.  My server explained to me that they do a True medium rare here and that many people are not used to it, and that she could put it back on the grill.  I thanked her but decided to eat the juicy steak as it was.  It was one of the better tasting steaks that I tried and surprised that the rib eye was under $30.  Berry Shortcake ($6) - This consisted of berries, citrus shortcake, hibiscus syrup, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream.  All the ingredients complemented each other really well and made for an incredible tasting dessert.  It was the perfect size to share with my part of 4.  All the desserts on the menu are priced at $6 and make for an affordable and delicious way to end the meal.  Overall I was really impressed with my steak and dessert.  The service here was incredible as our server checked in on us throughout the course of the meal and made sure everyone was happy.  The next time I'm in the mood for steak and in Vegas, this will be the only place I will visit!",

I swear she makes you feel like anything you pick is the right choice.  The staff was very attentive and our glasses were always full.  For lunch, we ordered unlimited mimosa ($11), portabello fries, and the vegetable chop salad to start.    The mimosa came with a glass of rose with a brandied cherry at the bottom and a mini carafe of OJ which allows you to adjust the ratio to your liking.    The veggie chop salad is one of our favorites, because it's not your average leafy green dish.  It comes with an assortment of crunchy squashes and veggies smothered in a creamy cilantro dressing.  A nice change for the palate.  The portobello fries ($6)were thick slices of fried goodness with a creamy wasabi dip.  Be careful these are addicting!  For the main course, we had the steak frites and the hanger sandwich.    The steak frites ($23) included a medium rare 4oz. filet with a side of creamy hollandaise sauce, two eggs, shoe string fries and grilled tomatoes on the side.    The flat iron steak sandwich ($12) was good, but kinda messy to eat. Every bite taken, the slices of steak pulled apart the sandwich which eventually the bread was ate separately.  The kettle chips were crispy and savory!  Overall great experience and highly recommend lunch or dinner res there!",

Bottomless mimosas $16 or bloody marys $22 are the way to go. I just found out yesterday that you can bring your own wine to enjoy with your meals - there is no corkage fee. Sparkling water is also complimentary. For brunch I recommend the Short rib hash or Grilled Cheese. For dinner I really like the Drunken Goat sandwich and Portabello fries. The filet tenderloin wagyu was delicious without any sauce. I dont recommend any of the desserts, they are plain nothing over the top. Service can be a hit or miss.",

If you are visiting, come here.  If you live here and haven't eaten here, shame on you!   Service is great.  You have managers overseeing the flow of service to ensure it's smooth and enjoyable. They always check in on you.    I reccomend the thick-cut bacon Avocado Toast Quinoa Salad Every cut of Steak  I think I could name the entire menu so just trust me when I say your expectations will be met!",

A bit small but honestly that's the only complaint. It was like the world's most decadent cheese bread.   2. Grilled Bacon appetizer - Also very good but small , looks like it's 2 pieces of bacon grilled and then a toothpick placed through it. It was delicious though.  3. Portobello fries- The biggest disappointment based on everyone on yelp raving about them. They're just fried mushrooms with a herb mayo. The only dish that missed with both of us.   4. Garlic Mashed Potatoes with White Cheddar - We had this with our steak. They were everything you would want a mashed potato to be. Excellent.   5. Chips - These also come with the meal and for just a fairly simple potato chip these too were excellent.   6 - 25oz NY Strip (Bone in) - price was in line with most steak houses and it was a beautiful cut of meat cooked perfectly medium rare but still had a nice wood char to it. Really great steak.   Overall I have no complaints , prices are overall much cheaper than your average steakhouse and the quality is right there. Taking that into account this is a 5 star kinda place.",

    "text": "Want an amazing brunch with spectacular service outside of the congested strip? Look no further than Echo & Rig in Tivoli Village. We made reservations for 9 am on Saturday (Open Table) and were seated early. We were given water as soon as we sat down (upstairs) and our menus. Our busser (not sure the appropriate name) made sure that our drinks were filled the entire time (I had an Arnold Palmer (don't have Chai Tea Latte) and my husband had a coffee) and our plates were taken as soon as we finished.  Our server was Nan and she was awesome. She informed us that Echo and Rig overnight their freshly caught seafood from the California coast. My husband and I started off with the avocado toast with shishito peppers and this was delicious. We then ordered the Farmers Market eggs (my dish) and the Steakhouse Scramble (my husbands). My dish was healthy, and delicious and wasn't one of those dishes that weighs you down after you eat.  As long as the temperatures are down and the weather is nice, I'd recommend eating outside because the view is really nice overlooking the fountains and the market that is open at 10 on Saturdays.  Food 5* Price 5* Location 5* Service 5*",

My party made last minute reservation at 1:30pm (busy time) with a party of 7. We were told that they could sit us but would have to split the party in two different tables. We agreed and were understanding due to the last minute planning. Upon checking in, the hostess  Alaina, did everything in her power to find a table for the entire party within 10 min (and it was still busy). Our server Nan, also provided extraordinary service. I'm sure the great customer service comes from great management. Keep it up, team!",

Our server, Jason, was knowledgable, detailed, attentive without being overwhelming. He helped guide our dinner choices in a wonderful direction!  The food: Pork Belly and Portabello Fries were both delicious appetizers! Pork Belly was my favorite though... this is a must!!! Creamy dreamy grits with the super flavorful pork belly... Yum! Southern Chicken Salad, was okay, nothing super special. Flavors are good, a  little dry. I wish I had tried the Over the Rainbow Salad... My husband and I shared the 46 ounce Tomahawk, Garlic Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, Asparagus w/ Fried Egg, and Kennebec French Fries.  Man...I wish I had took pics!!!!  The presentation was amazing... but nothing in comparison to the taste! The steak was perfect. Medium rare... flavorful... served sliced, perfect for sharing! (and perfect for the left overs the next day) The garlic mashed cheddar potatoes... mouthwatering....  The Kennebec Fries.... Ooooohhhh yeah........ best french fries I have ever had! Asparagus w/ fried egg... this is how asparagus should always be served!!!  I love not having to walk through a smoke filled casino to get this kind of restaurant. We valet parked within a few feet of the front door.   Sooooo glad I found this place! (I think they have some really good happy hour specials that I will be checking out!)",

You come in and the first thing you see is a full size butcher shop, but it's not your fathers butcher shop. Glass aging chamber with rows, and rows of beautiful steaks and steaks aging to perfection. And for all organic maniacs like my wife they sell over the counter, grass fed beef, chicken, pork, and lamb.   The place has two levels of awesome views of Tiboli village, and a picturesque Venice like shopping district. The restaurant overlooks the roundabout and beautiful fountain.   The tables are white linen, and the wine selection is great. Give it a shot next time your in Summerlin.",

Outdoor seating is perfect for the night time, perfect view of Tivoli Village.   SERVICE: The service is the ONLY reason as to why this place is receiving 5 stars and an A rating. Our server was absolutely phenomenal! I have never been to a place where I felt absolutely taken care of. Waiter was very informative, friendly, and attentive. Our order was messed up in the beginning, but the waiter took care of it and more! Not only compensated our wait with a complimentary kale salad, but also gave us a complimentary desert at the end of our meal.  FOOD/FLAVOR:  1. BAVETTE. $27.6. Medium rare. Highly recommend ordering this. It is \"One of Europe's most popular cuts.\" Complimented with a Red Wine Demi sauce on the side.  2. BERRY SHORTCAKE: Highly recommend this desert at the end of the meal. Phenomenal colors and plating. The tartness of the berries compliments the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream as well as the citrus shortcake. Great desert for sharing.   RETURN CHANCE: 8.5 likeliness. Very likely to return for dinner. Possibly try their brunch in the near future.  FINAL THOUGHTS: The service made the whole Echo & Rig experience worthwhile. Absolutely phenomenal service.  The food was a solid 7 out of 10. This was the best service I have ever received in all dinning. Please go check them out, will not be disappointed.",

From the scheduling of the reservation to the greeting of the hostess at the front and the service from the wait staff, I have never experienced a better night out. We have eaten at a stapling amount of steakhouses in California and Echo & Rig by far surpasses not only the quality of the meats, but the customer service as well.   Our server, Lauran, was very informative and kind. The food runner and wait staff were also super friendly and personable. We were sad to hear it was her last day.   The atmosphere is amazing and dressy casual attire appropriate. While it isn't on the strip, it is more then worth the journey.   My husband had a Filet Mignon and I ordered the Spencer steak (both medium rare) and we shared Roasted Broccolini and delicious Mac N Cheese. We were able to try the avocado toast and it was to yummy! There's a kick to the flavor that keeps you coming back for more and the peppers they serve with the toast compliment it very well. Our steaks were cooked perfectly and they literally melted in our mouths. As I mentioned before, my husband and I are seasoned when it comes to steakhouses ranging from $$-$$$$ and this place has made it to number one on our list.   We hope to return soon and are sad to live so far away from the delicious spot!",

So we decided we would have our moms birthday lunch there.We were a party of 9, half of our party got there and couldn't get seated until the rest of the party arrived which was acceptable. When the hostess decided to take them to get seated they took us outside without even asking if we wanted to sit outside and let me remind you it was COLD. When we booked our reso, we had mentioned we were celebrating a birthday . The manager did come great us and asked who the birthday girl was and told us he would make sure our meal experience was one we couldn't forget ....I thought okay this is going to be a great lunch ... we all ordered our meals . Many had the steak frites , portobello fries , goat sandwich , the waffle ,which were all ok. I ordered the avocado toast. Once everyone received their food , I was left with out my avo toast .. when the busser approached me and asked if we were missing anything I told him yes my meal. He went and informed the server since the server didn't check back. He then a couple minutes later came by and told me they ran out of avo toast ? Like shouldn't you have told me during the time the cooks were cooking that you ran out of my meal ?i mean were taking about toast and avocado ? Also we ordered a crab cake and we had to ask at least 3 times for it. We requested to see a menu again and the server failed to bring that over .  We did take a look at the desert menu but didn't seem interested in anything you guys had to offer . ALSO YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE ATLEAST BROUGHT OUT A LITTLE BIRTHDAY TREAT. But didn't do that .  So all in all the hype wasn't True at all . Will not be returning to this place . I will add THE BUSSER SHOULD HAVE GOT THE 50$ tip we left the server . He was on top of everything , refilled our drinks as soon as it hit half way . Asking if we needed anything . I didn't get his name but he was great !",

    "text": "I went to Echo & Rig with a large party of roughly 70 people. When you have a large group like this you need 4 main servers, 4 or 5 runners and how many managers to make sure things run smoothly and let me say they did not. First, we had servers come and take our drink order twice and then not everyone at our table got their drinks. Second, we ordered our food and of course my burger was burnt and, so I sent mine back. Third, we were to get potatoes, sausage and bacon family style and that did not come out with our meal nor before. Also, they brought bread and the bread ran out and they did not refill the bread. Our table did not get potatoes and the server dropped our sausage on the table. Fourth, they did not refill our beverages and people kept asking for refills. Fifth, what we did eat everyone said their food was good and well-seasoned. Last, if you know that you are expecting 70 people you should have prep better, so we would not have waited if we did. When you know that you have 70 people and being a Steakhouse, you need to let your other customers know that it is a possibility that they may have to wait for their food; however, I do not understand why your 70-top had to wait an hour and ten minutes for their food. At my table we discussed that no matter where we go the restaurants are never ready for us no matter how long they have known we were coming.  I will try them again for a party of 2. I will keep you posted!!",

The food was great, the service was incredible, and the bathroom had a sugar scrub! Bottomless mimosas are $16 and our glasses were never empty! The prices are fair. This was my first time dining here and now I will always recommend Echo & Rig for an elegant and affordable, bottomless mimosa brunch in Las Vegas!",

The bar is located downstairs & the dining room is upstairs.  They're outstanding with their service, from the host to the servers. Our server guided us through the entire menu explaining the dishes thoroughly.   Anyway, we started off with the Portobello fries. OMG, they are a must try. For my entree, I had the Tye dye salmon, which was delish. Their portions are just right! Not too overwhelming but not too little where you're still hungry. My friend ordered the Jumping beef, which I sampled and it was great. For dessert, we got the Berry shortcake. Yum!   It's a cute little place! Very fancy I must say. I hope to be back for their bottomless mimosas.",

I came in with jeans and a hat, but it was all good. The restaurant center has valet parking for Free, so that always a plus.  After a long 3 days in the Vegas Strip, we branched out to the northern side of the strip and tried this restaurant. Entering the restaurant I noticed the staff was incredibly helpful. We were seated outside in the second floor. We first started with out drinks, I ordered an Arnold palmer and a water. My table then proceeded to start off with a the hawain poke small plate, some Portobello fries and a potato pancake. After our appetizers we continued with a grilled cheese sand which and a chicken breast sandwich.  Both were delicious and were served with unique fries. Every was delicious, but the things that I disliked the most was the food took to long to come out. I was starving and so were the people in our table. We waited a bit too long for our food, but other than that, the food was delicious.  Overall, Great place to eat in Las Vegas. The little shopping center has lots of potential to attract many people in the future. Highly recommend this place for a classy brunch or dinner with a group of friends or a significant other.",

E&R is bright, modern and lively. The only throwback is their incredible service and food.   I ordered a pinot noir and when I inquired about the labels they offered, the waitress knew and could explain the difference between labels and recommended her favorite and why. Impressive for a non-sommelier.   But I have to give special recognition to the manager, Kevin. Charming. Charismatic. Confident. And he's young. I'm guessing 25, 26. So he was raised right. Trained right. And a delight to interact with.    E&R is a quality restaurant with old school attention to detail. Go to the restroom and wash your hands with their speciality salt scrub. E&R are on a whole other level.  Oh yeah, Everyone ordered a variation of steak, I ordered the Barramundi. Delicious.",

They have a terrace with outside seating that offers a nice view while you are dining.  When you first walk up to the door you are able to see the fresh cuts of meats from the butcher shop on the first floor. There is also a bar on the first floor if you want to have some drinks while your waiting for your table.  The food was pretty good.  The Ribeye was good. It was not the best steak I have ever had, but it was cooked properly and tasted just fine.  The Steak Tartar was excellent.  The kale salad and the portabella fries were also very good.  The service was excellent. The busser and the waitress did very well. The valet attendant even brought my keys to the table for me because they were closing for the evening.  The tables out on the terrace have great views of the valley. I would definitely recommend dining here.  You also have to try the Sunday Brunch. The brunch menu is reasonably price and the food is outstanding. The Short Rib Hash is wonderful.",

I was a little apprehensive about returning to the scene of the crime, but everything I had heard about Echo and Rig in addition to the level of professionalism shown by our server Lauran, brought us back.   Everyone deserves a second chance and the staff as Echo\"s took advantage of our return visit and made it an exceptional experience.   Thank you again to Derek Scharadin GM and our server Lauran. I would recommend you guy's  without hesitation!   PS. The portobello mushroom fries are amazing!",

They were also delicious. The steaks were kinda pricey for the size served. Mine was overdone just enough to make it medium instead of med rare. The chef did honor a special request. They cook the steaks over red oak; however, my husband does not like the smoky flavor. The chef agreed to cook it on the flat grill as long as they could serve it sliced. My husband did enjoy it. We also ordered a side of heirloom carrots.  Barely tried them due to filling up on the steaks.",

When seated, we waited 1 hr and 45 minutes for our food, which came out like warm. During this time, we were told from someone that they were working in our meal next- seems to be a general theme. Waiters were unprofessional, arguing with each other right in front of our table.  Will not be back. The whole experience costed us 3 hours. And to top it all off- one of our friends got vinegar poured all over their back from a waiter - accidentally of course. And there was no apology given- just a wet towel offered.",

I had such an urge to try this place that I took my chances and showed up to be put on the waiting list. Luckily for me there was no wait ! I was seated right away. I thoroughly enjoyed their bottomless mimosas and how they brought the OJ on the side instead of mixing it ahead . The staff was very friendly and came by numerous times to check on us and make sure we were enjoying our experience there. I met Beth the manager , extremely helpful and polite.  The decor was nice and I loved the hand scrub in the bathroom! I had the steakhouse scramble with a side of toast. They have an in house butcher so I'm dying to come back and experience a nice juicy steak for dinner.  The bacon looks amazing, I kept seeing it come out, I have to try that as well on my next visit.Overall a good place to go I  will definitely be back!.",

    "text": "We recently went to Echo & Rig for my husband's birthday. We had been wanting to try it and decided this would the perfect occasion. I called a few days ahead and made a reservation. The hostess was very nice over the phone and even asked if it was a special occasion.  On his birthday night, we were running late so we called and once again the hostess was extremely nice and accommodating. When we arrived they went out of their way to wish my husband a happy birthday and then took us to our table.  Staff was very attentive and friendly. Food was great as well. I had the spinach salad, which is amazing! I followed with the shrimp and artichoke entree, which was amazing. My husband loved his food as well. The meal ended with a special birthday dessert, which was yummy!  The only reason I won't give this place higher marks is because 1) it was freezing ( I even had a sweater and it wasn't enough) and 2) it was loud. I didn't expect some super intimate atmosphere, but the acoustics were not good at all and I could hear the conversation at other tables.  I would go again for sure ... I'll just bring a parka and some ear plugs!",

    "text": "This particular visit was on a Sunday for brunch.  We arrived around 10am and was seated upstairs on the patio.  Our server offered suggestions, was very attentive,  pretty funny and personable all while remaining cordial and respectful.  Being Echo & Rig, I had high expectations for their brunch.  I orderee their poached eggs with smoked salmon but opted for my eggs to be prepared differently.   The eggs came out wrong but my point in bringing this up is because of the way it was handled.   Good greif, you would think it was like a relay race in there.  It was taken care of with such speed and grace.   From the busser to the server, they didnt skip a beat.  My eggs were at my table, on my plate and in my belly on no time flat.  My point is, that NO restaurant can get things right all of the time,  but it's how they recover from it that will keep me coming back.  My husband and I will be entertaining friends from out of town tomorrow.  Normally when we have friends in town, we take them to the strip.  My suggestion to him was that we take them to Echo.  It's the small things that make a difference.   Oh and by the way, in case you were wondering,  my eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, potato with hollandaise sauce were the perfect combination.   My taste buds were having a party, lol!  They celebrated with bottomless mimosas.",

The steak was perfect, probably one of the best I've had. Flavorful juicy and cooked to perfection. The Portobello fries and cauliflower sides are a must! Great visual restaurant, the tables are upstairs and the live butcher shop is downstairs upon entry. The only thing lacking here is dessert. They only have ice cream. I would love to have seen some indulgent chocolate cake or souffle on the dessert menu after such a beautiful steak, but that's just me. Can't wait to bring the hubby here next trip to Vegas. Definitely a top 3 on my all time best steak places in town.",

They have that warm welcome and genuine greeting locked down to a point   Smoked salmon Benedict was delicious. I enjoyed that they did not use bread instead used potato pancakes (basically potato hash but no meat and well seasoned made into bun shape crispy outside soft inside). I've had sad egg benedicts where ingredients don't flow together but play separately. This dish, flavors blended nicely together.   Gimlet was also good. I'm not sure if it was traditonal gimlet as they use level one vodka and lots of berries but nonetheless refreshing.",

We have tried pretty much every single item on the menu and everything is absolutely amazing! The steaks are outstanding and the appetizer style dishes are delicious. There are too many recommendations to list here. Needless to say, you can't go wrong with anything because everything is superb.  We not only bring our local friends to this restaurant routinely, but we also bring many of our friends and family members that come to Vegas to visit us. Everyone is always extremely impressed and request for us to take them back there again and again. Not only is it extremely reasonably priced for the top notch food and service provided, but it is also unique in that there is no corkage fee! We always take our favorite bottles of wine from around the world and enjoy them with our incredible food. It can't get better than this!!!",

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and just flat out cool. The butcher downstairs is an immediate indicator that this restaurant is different, and augments its already urban and unique vibe. If you ever want to cook steak at home, buy your steaks here! They are less expensive (and way more delicious!) than those from Whole Foods.   Besides the amazing food, the best part of Echo & Rig by far is the staff. Every server we have ever had was kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. Xavier, the manager, has gone out of his way every single time we have visited to make us feel that we were taken care of. There is not a single restaurant in Vegas, including all of those on the Strip, that has better service.   And now, the food! Echo & Rig's menu is that perfect combination where you have plenty to pick from, but the concept feels connected. Everything is to die for, but I especially recommend the crab cake! It is the best one I've ever had.   All in all, Echo & Rig is an incredible restaurant and has done great things for Summerlin. I couldn't recommend it more!",

The variety of appetizers ranges from salads to portobello fries.  Every one was delicious.  The steaks are perfectly cooked prime beef.  Some are marinaded, others just seasoned with salt and pepper.  Their signature cocktails are nothing special.  Stick with wine.  The only desserts are ice cream sundaes.  Surely a restaurant of this quality can and should offer more variety.  The prices are 40% lower than on the Strip, without any reduction in quality.  We will definitely be back next time we visit Las Vegas.",

A friend made reservations and we were seated before our reservation which was great! Manager was awesome enough to offer to carry our martinis when we made it to the top of the stairs. Our server introduced himself, Dylan! He was nice and friendly. To be honest service wasn't great! Felt like we were a small party of 3 compared to his other two tables of 6 that were ordering bottles of wine. Decanters wine tastings that he was involved in with our 2 hours of dining there. Just wasn't attentive because we were a smaller party? Not sure! Had to order our main course through the manager and the steak came our warm not hot. We sent it back to get it warmed up. Have been here plenty of times, overall not a great dining experience. We'll just stick to the bar and spend the same amount of money! Better quality of service, bartender are catering, and food is hot! I'm not a picky person but am in the industry to understand and know what is expected.",

The main dining room is upstairs and the best evening seating is on the patio. The lights are enchanting and the views set a really romantic tone. My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM.   We ordered a few of the small plates and the two that stuck out the most to me werethe thick cut bacon which was decadent, juicy, and tender and was paired with a nicely balanced BBQ sauce that was tangy, sweet, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor (and trust me, I hate that smokey flavor). The most knock me on my knees and had me beggin' for more was the Portabella mushroom fries with a basil, garlic aoli, Oh, sweet baby Jesus! We need to pause for a moment of silence... This was off the charts amazing. Order this or else.  I cannot wait to head back and experience the meat here.  I guarantee it will be off the charts and butter knife tender.   E&R has set out to be Summerlin's butcher shop. You can order huge slabs of meat and they will cure them for you (up to a month) and you can choose to dine in or take it home. How awesome is that.",

What I love about Echo & Rig?  1. GRASSFED - They're steaks are grassfed, which makes them incredibly beneficial for your health. In addition, I honestly think this is the only steakhouse in America where you will find dry-aged, grassfed steaks.   2. TOMAHAWKS CUTS - They're steaks are GIGANTIC, often preserved in their original forms.   3. CUTS - Amazing selection of cuts, including many Kobe steaks available.   Lastly, they have a beautiful patio, with outdoor seating, for those who want a little more sunshine (or moonlight).   I'm absolutely in love with this steakhouse. It might be the best one in the world. Happy eating!",

They even get their fish off the boat that afternoon! :)  Service here is really great, they are very attentive with water (complimentary still or sparkling), and even ask if you would like refills on your beer.  =)    Entrees: Spencer Steak - perfectly cooked and comes with as many dipping sauces as you'd like Lamb (my dish) - tasty and satisfying.... i love lamb! lol Trenne pasta - a bit salty for all our palates.  it was an interesting pasta, a bit crispy and chewy with kale and chunks of prime rib.  Overall I give this place a glowing review and will definitely be back. Not cheap, but worth the price for quality farm to table food.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this was my second time eating here. The first time was definitely a 5 star review, hence I booked a reservation here for the second time to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday. A well deserved 1 star review.   First, we were sat on the patio. It was FREEZING cold and the hostess and servers could see my immediate distaste, but did nothing about it. In fact, a comment was made about how the inside was so full with bigger parties (even though we had a reservation). I didn't want to make a big fuss of it because the night was not about me it was about my boyfriend. There were several other people struggling as well. The table next to us was shivering so bad because their heat lamp wasn't working we offered them to join us and share our heat lamp.   Second, our server and manager were kind of pushy with alcohol. We don't drink and it was extremely annoying to say over and over again that we wouldn't like to order any cocktails. The disappointment was evident on our server's face.   Third, we decided to try oysters (never tried them before). We ate three of them but were extremely dissatisfied. I don't know if it's oysters in general or just theirs. Mine actually tasted gritty. When our server asked if we liked them, we politely said \"Eh, definitely not our favorite,\" and he said, \"Yeah, they're not for everyone.\" That was it! No, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that. What didn't you like about it? Can we offer you an alternative?\"   Fourth, we ordered the Salmon and New York steak. The New York steak was good. The salmon was EXTREMELY bland. Definitely needed more seasoning.   Fifth, our server barely stopped by the table. His assistant servers did all the work. He barely even stopped by to say Happy Birthday when we were already half way through the dessert.   Lastly, the manager stopped by our table a couple of times ( I think to make up for our server's lack of presence). However, he seemed so preoccupied and insincere, we felt even if we did complain it would fall deaf ears.   Overall, we felt completely overlooked and not special on this special occasion.  Definitely, won't be visiting again. Such a shame because our first experience was so great, but this experience was bad enough to never return.",

    "text": "Where to start with perfection?!  We were here in March for a worldwide catering convention and had this restaurant recommended by someone. We had 9 people in our party and were sat next to the kitchen and could watch, and hear, all the action on a busy night.   Don't remember all that was ordered but as chef was announcing the order to the kitchen he stopped and made a comment to the kitchen that this was the perfect order, we all had ordered nothing more than medium rare.   We started out with the portobello fries and sweetbreads and as a professional chef, with 2 other chefs at the table, they were excellent!  Several at the table had never had sweet breads before and are now huge fans.   Dinner couldn't have been better with the steaks cooked perfectly and flavored exquisitely.  Well done chef!    Having been in both the restaurant and catering business for over 25 years I understand the importance of a well trained and enthusiastic wait staff. I think that the service and professionalism we had were among the best I have ever had, I trained for 3 years in Europe at several Michelin star restaurants and they could learn from the server we had.   I will recommend Echo and Rig to everyone and will return often!",

Well, that was totally wrong. We ended up waiting for over an hour for a table and were stressed out because we had people coming over to celebrate my husband's birthday and didn't know if we'd make it home in time. The frustrating part was that we were told it would be a 45 minute wait and it ended up being closer to an hour and a half! And they didn't do a good job letting us know what was going on. The meal itself was good but not exceptional.   We have been many times since for their happy hour which is really great. $2 steak & eggs, $2 shrimp cocktail & $1 hot dogs. Plus they have drink specials. The other really nice thing is that they have no corkage fee so you can bring your own wine :-)",

We were surprised to find that it was also a bar and restaurant.   I had the BLT, and it was to die for! The bacon was crispy, the tomatoes were a variety, and I can't say enough about how wonderful it was. He had the seafood pasta (I don't remember the exact name of the dish). I'm so glad I didn't order that! While the seafood in his was good, the sauce and pasta with squid ink was not for me. It wasn't for him either, as he left most of it behind!  We love to dine slowly and sit and talk, and I did feel like they were hovering around wondering when we were going to leave, even though there were lots of tables available. That said, we will be back!",

We made a reservation for 6:30 but showed up a little early and they still seated us promptly. When we entered, the dining area was borderline empty, however, it filled up quickly within in the hour. And after the meal & service, I understood why!  The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything special, and we let slip that it was my birthday. Every member of the staff that we came into contact afterward, wished me happy birthday. The manager even came over and introduced himself and our server, also wishing me a happy birthday and telling the server to \"take care of me\". Very nice gesture. We decided to opt for a steak chosen off their slab; the server recommended the 40 oz. porterhouse & we went for it. The cook time did take a bit, however, the length of time went practically unnoticed as we were busy enjoying our cocktails (autumn sangria was rather tasty) & portobello fries. The fries were incredible & a MUST try! My boyfriend actually hates mushrooms and had no idea what a portobello was.. however, he really enjoyed those fries and ate more than I did. When our dinner came, the steak was cooked to perfection & those garlic chips?! Amazing!! We chose garlic mashed potatoes & a baked sweet potato as our sides, which paired incredibly. I would highly recommend Echo & Rig for their fantastic service & incredible food.",

I have to say the food makes up for the fussiness, though!  I got to taste the following: ---  Small plate - pork belly on white grits.  This was just outstanding.  The grits were surprisingly good! ---  Tri-tip Steak.  The star of the evening (wish I had ordered it).  Perfectly cooked with just the right sear on the outside.  The accompanying peppercorn sauce was just fabulous. ---  Flat Iron Steak:  This was also quite good, although not nearly as tasty as the tri-tip.  Be careful ordering anything less than medium if you don't like a bloody steak.  This was undercooked compared to a normal medium-rare, but I didn't mind. ---  Trenne pasta:  We had no idea what \"trenne\" was, so we Googled it.  It's kind of like penne, but it's crunchy.  Weird.  Came with pieces of steak and kale, it was very good.  Be on the lookout for trenne!  The pricing here is very reasonable given the location and atmosphere.  The service was impeccable.  One nit to pick:  what's with the guys standing with their arms crossed, looking at the customers?  Are they bouncers or what?  Some muscle-bound fellow in an extremely ill-fitting suit was standing in the corner, glowering in our general direction.  I headed to the restroom and sure enough, another primate in a bad suit was standing in the corner.  NOTE:  I was wearing jeans, just sayin'  I guess they're supervisors or something - I dunno, watching them watching me put me off my feed a little bit...  :)",

But they are using quality products. Business trip with hubby to MGM Grand for five days.  This trip we decided to eat off the over-done beaten to death \"super-star\" chef restaurants where you NEVER see the Chef.  check out Eater Las Vegas and other \"less\" marketing type suggestions.  When 639 reviews are in and you have 4.5 stars I've gotta check it out. As most people have said - SERVICE.  It matters.  Keep it up - it matters. Everyone wants to be treated like a VIP and we sure were! Upon arrival this happy couple asked for a table for two and were told about 30 min wait.  So with good music playing hubby and I did a few moves, smiling and enjoying life!  Arrianna - the hostess, she is a gem and I hope E & R keep her and give her a raise!  Arrianna, thank you so much for connecting with us and appreciating San Diego as much as we do!  We weren't going to sit outside, but happy we did.  Arrianna put us at a great table on the patio with a view of the water fountain, lights and enjoyable temps in the 80's at 8 p.m. for dinner on a Tuesday. Let me also say - the place was packed on a Tuesday night!",

Not disappointed-loved the ambiance, the concept, the price, the service and yes, the food. This place did not rush you in the least and truly seemed to relish in your having enjoyed the dining experience. 4 glasses of wine, portobello fries, split a Bibb/Blue salad, spencer steak, rib-eye and finished up with a shared Carmel turtle sundae-bill=$108 (tip exclusive). Very satisfied and will return as many items on menu have yet to be tried.",

    "text": "I've eaten at several steakhouses on the strip including Carnevino and Craftsteak, and can say without hesitation that Echo and Rig is by far the best steakhouse in Las Vegas.  I was particularly impressed by their commitment to sourcing food locally, and the selection and  quality of the meat offered was outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  Our server, Brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and I.  The ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  Shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  My dining partner and I ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the Jumping Beef and the Bavette as our entrees.  All steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  The accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. We  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae that was more than big enough to share. Every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  We had all of that food along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  There is no way a meal like that for two people would have cost so little on the strip.  I highly recommend Echo and Rig to anyone who wants a wonderful meal, in a beautiful setting, with impeccable service at an extraordinarily reasonable price.  We will definitely be back.",

My husband and I went there for our second anniversary in a row and our server Nick (Nicholas) gave us the best dining experience I've ever had at any restaurant. He knew the menu, brought us suggestions that far exceeded out expectations, and comped our desert for our anniversary! (The salted caramel ice cream with toffee nuts and chocolate bits is to DIE for). And the manager Xavier makes you feel like family. He was the manager on duty both times my husband and I were there and he makes you feel like you are the only couple in the restaurant. The team communicates so well about each customer, that you get a service unlike any other restaurant that you've ever been to. Echo&Rig is my number one choice for a steak house in Las Vegas and we will continue to go there for every birthday and anniversary as long as we live in Las Vegas! Thank you Nick and Xavier for completing our amazing wedding anniversary.",

    "text": "The customer service at this place sucks.  It was just my wife and I and we were celebrating her birthday.  Our waiter was apparently training another server.  My wife ordered her steak to be well done and she realizes that chef's hate when someone asks for the steak to be cooked well done but that is the way she likes it.  They offered to butterfly the steak to ensure that it was cooked correctly and she agreed.  When the runner brought the meal out, a vast majority of the steak it was medium-rare at best.  She also ordered the Heirloom Carrots which most of them came out burned.  Unfortunately, neither our waiter nor his trainee came out to check on us for at least 20 minutes after we received our meal.  My wife ate the part of the steak that was cooked to her request and some of the unburned carrots.  We both ran out of water and she ran out of her soda and it sat empty on our table for at least 10 minutes.  Luckily, we were sitting in the corner so I reached over and grabbed the bottle of water and refilled both our glasses.  Our waiter walked near our table several times but never checked on us.  Normally, I would have raised my hand and asked for something but after awhile, it became a test to see just how long this guy was actually going to go without even asking how our dinner was.  This was a Saturday night during dinner and I understand that it was busy, and I understand that our waiter was probably busier than normal because he was training the other guy but there is absolutely no excuse for not checking on our table for roughly 20 minutes after the meal is brought out.  When our waiter finally checked on us, I asked for the manager.  I explained to the manager that we had 3 problems, 1) the steak was not cooked correctly  2) most of the carrots were burned  3) our waiter never came by to check on us and my wife's soda had been empty for most of the meal.  The manager left the table to go speak to the chef.  When he returned, he partially apologized but mostly he took the position that the steaks are butcher cut not machine cut so it makes the steak thicker and apparently harder to cook.  This is total BS to say that a chef is unable to properly cook a steak to the customer's request because it is thick, especially considering that it was butterfly cut.  He also stated that the carrots are supposed to be charred but most of them were this way while the others were normal.  The charred carrots were cooked too much and tasted burned.  He offered to take the carrots off the bill but we stated that it would not be necessary since my wife ate some of the unburned ones.  The waiter promptly returned with a soda while the manager was talking to us the second time.  Probably the most shocking thing is that the waiter never apologized.  I expected him to say that he was sorry and that he is really busy tonight but he didn't say anything to us.  There is no doubt that he knew exactly why we asked for the manager.  My dinner was fine so this experience was not entirely negative.  We also expected that maybe they would comp a desert or do something to make the situation right but they did not (although I did decline to have the carrots taken off the ticket).  I realize that almost everyone on Yelp loves this place, which is why we went there but I expected way more.  We spent nearly $100 for the two of us and I realize that it is not the most expensive meal in the world but we should most certainly have a better customer service experience.",

So me and my date sat in the lounge, as we sat down the cocktail sever approached us and asked us if we wanted a drink while we waited to be seated. We waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated. The server greeted us within 2 minutes of getting to the table and asked us if we wanted some thing to drink. I ordered a porter, but I came to find out that they were out of it. I am not a big fan of mushrooms but many yelper said that you have to try the portobello fries and they are right. My date didn't want to try them and even she was amazed my them. I ordered the filet medium rare with the onion sauce. I would have to say that the steak was amazing by itself and it does not need any sauce. I ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side and there was nothing special about it. The service was probably some of the best that I have had. The server was on point. I wish I remembered his name because I would ask for him when I go back. I would have to say that Echo and Rig is probably one of my favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas.",

We had a very nice and attentive server and the menu was reasonably priced. My only complaint about the place (which is unfortunately a big deal for me...a steak eater) is that they absolutely massacred the ribeye steak I ordered. I like my steaks medium to medium well, but what they served me was completely unacceptable. I was served a steak so raw it was purple...the look of almost completely uncooked meat. After sending the plate back, I then received the same steak back (not a new one) that was completely charred. The only thing I could taste was this burnt, charcoaled flavor. The young and polite matrodie (or whatever title he held) noticed my displeasure and asked me how my meal was. After I showed him, it was obvious he was concerned.....BUT HE DIDN'T OFFER ME A NEW STEAK! They removed the charges from the bill, but I would have rather paid and received what I went to the place for. I ended up leaving the place hungry.  Very, very dissapointing.",

I took my family for an early Mother's day dinner and although the hope was to dine out on the patio the wind sure did take the enjoyment out of the experience. The staff went above and beyond to try to help us make the best of the situation but in the end the wind won. The staff could have just apologized and rush us out but even though there was an hour and a half wait they found us a spot inside so we could enjoy the rest of our meal. Nina was our server and she was very pleasant. I too am a food server so I tend to have high expectations as I know the level of service I give to every guest and she did not disappoint!!!! The food was fantastic and when the final bill arrived I was pleasantly surprised. What a great job this restaurant has done at quality, value, and superb service. My husband and I will be returning and you can count on us to spread the word about this unique and delightful experience!!!!!",

The waiters do not have a clue. 3 times I have eaten there. 3 times I have told them, I can not have cheese. Believe it or not, all THREE times, they served me food with cheese. As a bonus, I ate but one piece of my steak the last time I ate there. When the waiter cleared the table, I was not asked about my steak, not one word. Three strikes and your out. The good news is both the quality and taste of the meat is impeccable. All small plates are tasty. The fried chicken is amazing. The burnt peas and the pumpkin are my 2 favorites of the veggies. Unfortunately, they take no reservations, the wait is often long and always uncomfortable. I now get the meat to go. I have never been disappointed. No worries though, I ordered some small plates to go one night. On the ticket was written no cheese. I enjoyed the pumpkin and the brussell sprouts. Unfortunately, my asparagus had cheese on it. I called and told them what happened. The lady insisted she take my phone number, so a manager could call and take care of it. That happened 6 months ago. I am still waiting for the call. Sad, as this could be among the best in Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Echo & Rig last night for our anniversary.  Had never heard of it and were looking for a nice steakhouse in Summerlin area.  Although it was busy and it was prom night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes or so for a table.  The manager came over and introduced himself and let us know who our waiter would be.      The service was great and very reasonable prices although sides are ala carte.  I had the Spencer cut and my husband had the tri-tips and we thought this was one of the best meals we ever had.  For dessert, I had the sorbet and he had the Caramel Turtle sundae which were huge portions and we both enjoyed it.  Like many restaurants in Vegas, there was an extensive wine list but very few by the glass.  I don't know why they do this as not everyone wants a bottle.  I ended up asking for a Mai Tai even though it wasn't on the cocktail list and it was pretty good.  Our only complaint, again a restaurant trend, is the music was extremely loud which made it hard to hear the waiter and if we had other people with us, we would have had a hard time with conversation.  We would definitely go back and plan to recommend to friends.  I checked off Casual but we were a little dressed up.  Nicer casual, I'd say.  Ambience wasn't intimate, in fact felt a little packed in at first but better when the crowd thinned out.",

The Caesar salad was good but  the dressing did not taste like it had garlic in it. The waitress was the ditziest I have ever experienced..every 3rd word was yummie..gr8 English vocabulary she had, dah..poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz. When we asked about the sides..well, her comment was they are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any. We finally got bread as we finished our entrees. The Tuscan bread was the saltiest I have ever had..absolutely inedible.  We will  return for the steak & sides. They are quite disorganized with so many employees that are poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids. Poor on the service side. Definitely not even close to T Bones in Red Rock. The meats in the butcher shop are off the chart expensive & they raise the per lb price almost every day. No way is a lousy tough NY strip steak worth $27./lb.  The whole carcusses are hanging in their window as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf. That is enough to turn anybody off. Very attractive restaurant but extremely loud with marble-like hard floors. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor. Nice outdoor dining if it is not too hot outdoors.",

The service there is impeccable- everyone really is very nice.  I also loved that there were many small plates offered and you know how girls are with tapas!  I loved being able to try many things on my first time there- Portobello fries with aioli, a crabcake, lamb cigars with tzaziki, calamari with aioli and a marinara dip, brie in a sourdough bowl with an apple compote, a tomato and watermelon salad, a turtle sundae and a chocolate cherry sundae.  I might have tried more items but for now that's all I can remember.  I loved the calamari especially- I wouldn't think I would like the aioli with it over marinara but I really did love it!  Barbara came by our table and offered us assistance with reservations if we need in the future and let us know about their happy hour specials.  She mentioned hot dogs and I asked if they were nitrate-free.  She said they were not BUT their butcher shop downstairs occasionally makes homemade hotdogs you can purchase and take home that are nitrate-free!  I can't wait to come back here!!!! YUM!

My problem is with the staff.  I have been to this restaurant over a dozen times and, in the beginning when the restaurant first opened, the staff was very attentive and concerned that customers were taken care of.  I can't say that anymore, especially in the bar.  I stopped at Echo and Rig recently to buy from the butcher shop.  It was only 4 pm.  I ordered the sausage I came for and went to have a HH drink. The bartender  -- a blonde woman -- was at the far right end of the bar talking to ladies intimately as if they were her friends. I sat on the left between two women and waited. Then, another woman sits down to the left of me and the bartender comes over with a drink already made for her .. walks right past me and says nothing. Apparently, another friend. Then she walks past me again, not even a glance! Eventually, she comes back to talk to the new woman who is definitely a friend. I interject, asking about HH. She tosses a flyer to me and keeps walking.  It's not busy at all so I'm beginning to think it's a girl's bar .....she was laughing with the ladies at the end of the bar.   I left. Got my sausage from the wonderful butcher and went home.  I won't stop going to this restaurant.  But will only go for the butcher and for the food but, I won't be sitting at the bar any time soon.  I've heard similar complaints about the wait staff in the diningroom  from friends and I'm hoping beyond hope that it isn't True",

    "text": "Where should I start? 5/5 all over, the food, service, EVERYTHING!  Ordered the following items: Appetizers.... Tomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion - my friend wanted this dish because she LOVES watermelon during the summer season. I was like, let's give it a try cause I like cucumbers. This dish was very refreshing, sweet and hint of onion-y taste. 5/5!  Asparagus and fried egg - I. LOVE. ASPARAGUS!!! Yes, it does make things smell funky when you're in the restroom but hey this vegetable is stalk-y and green! They grill the asparagus to perfection where you can eat the bottom (the white end). Crunchy and delish.   Grilled octopus, gigante beans and green olives - I love octopus. I thought it was weird mixing octopus, beans and olives altogether. I was wrong!  Pork belly and spicy slaw - Ok so the slaw wasn't spicy but the pork belly was surprisingly porky! Good marinade and cooked well.  Maryland lump crab cake - The crab in this crab cake tastes so fresh out of the water! 5/5!  Ceviche \"Peruvian style\" - I'm torn between the two seafood I had but this one was the home run in my tummy. Fresh. Lime-y. Spicy. Amazing 6/5!  Portobello fries and herb aioli - I'm a fan of mushrooms...Portobello specifically. The portobello was cut into wedges so they looked like steak fries. I wasn't paying attention eating it, thinking it was, seriously, french fries. BUT OMG PORTOBELLO!!! The sauce was amazing!  Main course... The Spencer Steak with brandied mushroom sauce - I named my steak Steven, I wanted to marry him cause he was so soft, pink and delicious. But I ate him. 'nuff said.  Dessert... Cappuccino sundae - Pound cake!!! Yes, there's pound cake in the bottom! It also has chocolate shavings and fudge!  Caramel turtle sundae - bourbon and salted caramel ice cream. That's all you need to know about this dish!  The service was spectacular. They changed our utensils everytime a new dish came out. Filled our water everytime it was empty. I felt bad that I was making the servers work. Oh well. Great service!  Bottom line: would come here again.",

Our bottomless mimosas were constantly full. The bathrooms are amazing. Well, the ladies restroom at least. The stalls are large and private, there is a lounge area, large mirror, and the sinks were beautiful. Their napkins were so nice I second guessed wether I should throw them away or put them in a hamper! They even have an exfoliating scrub which makes your hands feel like butter. I visited in January 2017 and the manager came up to our table, made sure everything was perfect, and chatted with us a bit. She was so nice and really added to our experience. I will be in town this weekend and am hoping to go again!",

Got to the table and waited 20 minutes and no one. Lots of waiters running around but no one for our table.   Finally a guy in a suit comes and apologized, Derek. He takes our drink order and says he will take care of it and send a waiter out and something for us to eat.  10 minutes after that the waiter comes. He says \"oh you put the menu aside so fast\"   Ummm no dip shit, we have been sitting here....he doesn't even say sorry but continues to take our order.   Then the drinks finally arrive and Derek's apology dishes. Cauliflower and a watermelon salad. Both were pretty good.   The steaks took awhile. And they were ok. Nothing spectacular.   Apple pie sundae was just apples cut up in ice cream. No crust- just a cookie. Nothing to write home about.   It's an ok steak place with the worst service on the planet. There are too many other great steak places with great service to come back to this one. Hey it's Vegas, we have a lot of places to choose from--and this is not one I'd choose again.",

We originally had thought of going to Fogo de Chao but the thought of driving another 25 minutes for some juicy steaks is just not worth it. We YELPED (of course! Who doesn't????????) \"Steaks\" and instantly landed out eyes on this 4.5 star restaurant nearby.  Anyway, we shared the Tomahawk and being that it's grass fed, it was sooooooo delicious!!!!! We also got the chicken soup with marrow and that was a little too salty for me. The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are always great no matter where you get them so those are safe.  I'm just a little surprised this place only has 2 dollar signs. I think it should be at least $$$ and not $$. It's not the cheapest place to eat. Nonetheless, the food was worth it and the service was beyond great!!!!!",

All of the employees were congenial and accommodating. Went for brunch for my daughter's birthday. Manager knew her name and wished her Happy Birthday right off the bat, as they seated her in a high back chair, which was the only one at the table..made her feel special! Complimentary still or sparkling water always AND my daughter received a complimentary birthday sundae of her choice. Very nice. Brunch was very good, excellent menu and food quality. I had a salad with grilled salmon on side, excellent, but was still hungry when I left. Portions depend on what you get. This salad I had was not on the 'small plate' list, but I think it could have been! Also, I have to eat gluten & dairy free, so my choices were limited. One thing that I thought was strange, though, was at the end of our meal, as we were leaving, the manager came up to me, gave me her card and asked I call the restaurant directly for future reservations as I had gone through Open Table and she made a comment that they cannot always accommodate accordingly when done thru Open Table.",

The $1.99 hot dog was okay, nothing special. Why the two-star review then? The service.  I arrived first and sat in the bar area, knowing that happy hour started at 3pm. My friend came not long afterward, and the bartender gave us menus and glasses of water and introduced himself. We caught up for a few minutes and perused the menu. Around 2:45, my friend called out \"Hey!\" to get the bartender's attention because he was down at the other end and hadn't come back over to check on us. We asked about the happy hour menu, and he explained to us that there wasn't really a menu, only three $1.99 items. At this point one of the butchers with a long beard (is that even hygienic?) had walked up to the bar. After the bartender walked away, he made eye contact with the butcher, who proceeded to roll his eyes. EXCUSE US. What did we do to offend your genteel manner? I thought the point of happy hour was to generate foot traffic and money during a time of day when people aren't sitting down for a meal.  The bartender, who will remain nameless, came back afterward to tell us that his \"name is K*****, not 'hey you.'\" First of all, my friend didn't say, \"Hey, you.\" Second of all, how often do you remember your server's name without having him remind you at least once? Thirdly, I would have let go of this reprimand if it wasn't already obvious from the butcher's actions that they were not pleased to have two women in the bar at HAPPY HOUR asking about HAPPY HOUR specials. We both felt like this bartender resented serving us, but we decided to stay anyway since we've been there for lunch, brunch, and happy hour before and liked the food. This wait staff experience, though, was a disappointment and quite matter of factly, bullshit.",

Eddie are server didnt disappoint infact he stepped it up , knowledgeable and very gracious I tipped him 25% and would do more. We had the peach sangeria and dyneyous for cocktails both excellent.  The bone marrow carne asada was a flavor orgy all my taste buds were invited to , the black tuscon kale was hands down best kale ever! The butcher shop pork sausage was also on point. We spilt the spener cut ribeye rare and charred onion sause on the side. It didnt need sause it melted in your mouth however the sause didnt mask tge flavor it enhanced it nicely. I really cant say enough oh other than with tip out the door $100.00 for best service in las vegas and grass fed , non gmo and antibiotic free food!",

We were greeted by the manager Robert who blew me away on level of knowledge he had on the details on different types of entrees available on the menu. On top of that he was perfect choice of management for this restaurant being very friendly, very bright and hospitable. Our waiter Edward was just as good, making sure we were taken care as if we were family with a great sense of humor. With the quality of food and atmosphere you would expect to pay at least $60-70 per entree but here we spent nearly half. We live in Los Angeles and come to Vegas at least 10-20 times a year. I will definitely be coming back to Echo & Rig every time we visit Vegas, this place is amazing.",

The atmosphere was great, and everybody from the hostess to manager and everyone in between were very nice. Service was a little on the slow side, but I'll chalk that up to it being a busy night. It was Friday night at 8pm after all and the dining area was full. We will definitely be eating here again.",

First experience was a warm-from-the-oven croissant with thin sliced beef and a glass of wine (on 1st floor) on a Saturday afternoon.  Didn't even know yet that there was a restaurant upstairs!   Second visit was dinner for four (no reservations accepted so there about a 20 min wait on a Saturday night).   OMG!  Everything we ordered was terrific.  Absolutely loved the heirloom salad -- highly recommend.  Will definitely return!  (Agree with other post stating that people were dressed well :-)   Beautiful location, great ambiance, fantastic food, cheerful, friendly service.  A very fun evening!",

Cool place though and I plan to try it one more time in case this was just an off night for the good cook.",

    "text": "I have dined here twice now and I can easily say I am addicted. All of their steaks are from grass fed USDA cattle and are fresh cut daily in the butcher shop downstairs. The menu offers a wide variety of cuts as well as daily specials that are off the menu.  I highly recommend the filet, hanger, of the spencer steak.  The appetizers have never disappointed either.  My favorite from the appetizer menu had to be the lump crab cake, it is a single crab cake, but the flavor was amazing!  The filet chop salad was a must as well, it comes packed with steak and other cold cuts, and a bunch of different veggies for only around $10.  For a steak house of this quality, they prices are very fair. Anywhere else in town I easily pay 2-3x the price for similar quality.  The staff is extremely friendly and on point. We were kindly greeted by the manager when we say down, who knew we were returning guests. Our wait team never let my glass get half empty and they were constantly checking on us to ensure we had our needs met.  Needless to say, go here for a nice date night for any occasion, you will not be disappointed.",

On New Years Eve we sat at the bar (first time there, friend recommended) and this beautiful young woman approached us(I believe her name was Janna). She was very attentive, answered all of our questions, and even suggested a red wine that would compliment what we were having for dinner. We returned last night 1/9 and I was so happy to see her again! She remembered what we had from appetizers down to the wine! She is such a great spirit, we hope to see her more and more when we visit from L.A! If you haven't tried Echo & Rig yet...you are strange!!",

We received phenomenal service - I was worried bringing the kids with us, but the entire staff treated them so well! Both boys were acknowledged and asked their names by the hostess and our server.  My oldest was shocked as they are usually overlooked.  Our server, Nan, was perfect!  Our sons split the waffle and she had the kitchen split the entire order before it came to the table, including separate syrup, whipped cream, and berries for each boy (pretty sure that move ended any potential sharing wars, it was perfect! And each boy felt important having their own array of food).  My husband and I started with the potato pancakes, which came with two pancakes that were so crispy on the outside and flavorful!  Then we had the portobello fries.  I didn't think I'd like them, but I was so wrong! They were amazing, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce! I could have been fine with a few orders of those!  My husband and I then decided to share orders of the burger and the short rib hash.  Nan went above and beyond again and had our order split before it came to the table so that my husband and I did not have to swap food on our own plates; such a nice touch and thoughtful gesture!  The burger, perfectly cooked and actually medium rare, was melt in your mouth delicious.  The short rib hash was amazing as well.  The food was all so delicious and the service was so attentive and helpful that I cannot wait to go back again!",

We arrived around 7:00 and expected a wait since it was Friday. We were seated at a smallish table that wobbled and a bus buy was immediately sent over with shims to fix it. Perfect. The waiter explained the menu, offered his recommendations and we were off to a normal Las Vegas steakhouse experience.... Until the service sputtered and crashed. Interestingly our section started clearing out after we ordered so I can't say it got busier for them. The first issue was the bread we were told about never came. Fine. We had the amazing portobello fries to munch on anyways. Getting water glasses refilled was a constant struggle throughout the visit. Next, out steaks arrive, without steak knives. I asked for one but my friend didn't think to, assuming they'd bring for both of us. Out comes one steak knife, just one. We ask for another. It comes. She had to remind the server to bring her wine. Oddly, he never asked if she'd care for another glass...? Look, the food is delicious, the concept is wonderful but the staff needs more training. You can't compete in a service-centric town like Las Vegas with mediocre wait staff. I live in the southeast so tivoli village is a hike for me. I'd give the place another shot, but maybe after they've had more time to find their service niche.",

We all had steak which was cooked to perfection, but the four of us all agreed, their small plates and the variety of small plates is the reason we will be regulars there. Do NOT forget to order the charred Pork Belly. OMG!!! We enjoyed every bite and almost had no room for our steaks.

In an age of unlimited data, metrics, and analysis, I find the excuse of not knowing your customer flow to be a little insulting. By the way, what is the role of the three hosts?   Where are the managers and what is their role in all this? Our previous experience at Echo & Rig is that one of the managers will do a courtesy stop by the table. Of course, this did not happen.   Has Echo & Rig forgotten about the basics of the total customer experience? Thankfully our server Jesse saved the evening for what started as a horrible experience.    Las Vegas is a service town, and the expectation is high to deliver a quality experience. You are only as good as the last experience, and you are a victim of your success.

I tried the Skirt steak which was flavorful and cooked to perfection at medium.  I usually go for medium-rare, but I went with waiters recommendation.  The portobello fries with basil aioli were amazing, only cooked with a light coating of flour.   The kids loved their Mac & Cheese.  Filet, Brisket, Ribeye....all very good!",

I also try to come for birthdays any occasion is the right one to come here.  My mom enjoyed it. She appreciated that it wasn't so stuffy like other steak houses. And so do I. It's very relaxed intimate atmosphere. And I don't have to spend an arm and a leg to eat a great meal. Great for lunch too !!!",

The shrimp and artichokes was my favorite.",

Food is fantastic, we ordered the bacon appetizer, the crab cake, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, a steak and the butterfish - everything was on point! Party of flavors in my mouth. :) Staff was friendly but always in a rush, they also brought out the board of bone in steaks after we ordered 'in case we wanted to change our mind'... ok the atmosphere is like you're sitting in a middle of a train station, it's open layout, everything echos, from peoples conversations to the dishes and silverwear in the kitchen. It's so loud, you can here it from the parking lot. I couldn't hold a conversation without yelling across the table.",

The night started a bit slow when we had to wait a little after our reservation time and it took a while for us to get our first glasses of water, but Ricky was nothing short of attentive and filled our glasses without us having to ask first.  New review on the new/revised menu items: 1) Alaskan Cod: fluffy, white fish cooked to perfection. It's served with a buttered crostini that crunch-ily melts in your mouth. 2) The Spencer Steak: This was on the menu before, I had just never tried it. This, I kid you not, was the best steak ribeye I've had to date. Perfectly charred, juicy, with a flawless pink center. 3) Hawaiian Ahi Poke: First time trying this menu item. I can be weird about my raw fish, but this. was. stellar. Not overly saucy and served with the perfect amount of seaweed and cucumber. Tasted like it had been marinating for days! I didn't lose any flavor as I bit into it. 4) Portabello fries: still <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>  Stellar service and even more spectacular food...hope to make it to Echo and Rig's brunch soon!",

You can watch them pick amazing cuts of meat and hand slice everything. Would love to come back and try dinner. A huge group of friends and I came here for brunch. They have a great deal on unlimited bloody Mary's and mimosa however the service was lacking when refilling these drinks. I got a simple breakfast sandwich called the NY egg and it was just that a basic breakfast sandwhich. I love the over medium eggs on the sandwich however I would have chosen a different bun... possibly even just toasted the bun. My brother got the grilled cheese and the awesome thing was it had short rib meat in it, very good and Interesting flavor combination, YUM! A couple of my friends got the smoked salmon and cream cheese (loxs) Benedict. They loved it but too me that's too many crazy flavors lol. Would come back again would love to try dinner!",

This is a what truly makes a memorable dining experience!   My gal pals and I decided to come in celebration of my birthday, and it was indeed a memorable birthday dinner! We got lucky with the reservation, as late April is prom season (so make sure you reserve in advanced!).   We ordered the Spencer steak, one with the red wine reduction sauce and one with the bleu cheese sauce, the linguini and clams, and the horseradish butterfish.   The steaks were delicious, and cooked medium rare as we wanted. The red win reduction sauce is really something to rave about that...it was flavorful! The stuffed mushroom that came with it was a nice addition to the steak, and the homemade potatoes chips were well made. Not the greatest in terms of presentation, but a delectable dish nonetheless.   The linguini and clams was such a refreshing dish! I haven't had a linguini dish that I've loved in quite some time...this was perfect! The sauce and spices used made the dish really enjoyable. It was flavorful but not overbearing, and went well with the perfectly cooked pasta and clams. The sauce was sooo good that we ate the remaining sauce with the complimentary bread! That's really saying something!   The butterfish was also very soft and flaky and so enjoyable to eat. It just tasted like buttery fish! It was cooked to perfection, not overdone, and nice and crisp on the outside.  Overall, I loved this dining experience so very much, and I would love to come back one day to have their brunch!",

Still on the pricey side,  but the prices are reasonable for what you order compared to other steak houses we checked out in Vegas. They have a butcher shop.and show you cuts of meat before you order.  Filet mignon: excellent,  melts in your mouth. Portabella fries: crispy with a side of pesto cream dip, yummy. Onion soup au gratin:  Was not hot enough. Once I sent it back it was amazing.  if  you like cheese this is for you, not a good first date dish though, the cheese stretches and  literally melts everywhere while you are eating it. Delicious but hard to figure out how to control yourself and be proper while eating it. Baked brie in pastry crust: has a nutty buttery flavor cheesy goodness. Not quite as messy as the soup but really good. Caesar salad. Pretty good One of the unexpected hghlights was the carmel turtle sundae dessert! We came here for my son's 16th birthday and they gave it to us for free with extra spoons. I have to say it was amazing! Dark chocolate chunks with caramel and lightly salted caramel ice cream, very rich and creamy, almost too good for kids! Wow.  Overall really good experience. Will definitely come back.",

This place not only has excellent made from scratch sides and high quality hand cut steaks but their service and management is outstanding!   A couple of things that make Echo & Rig extra special: * They have a killer happy hour.  * No corking fee and they encourage you to bring your own wine! * Beautiful upstairs patio that over looks Tivoli Village.  * In-house Butcher Shop where you can buy different cuts to take home.  * Great bar for hanging at downstairs.   Echo & Rig is an all around terrific restaurant. If you're visiting or a Las Vegas local, you should definitely check this place out!",

Prices were super reasonable and the food was fantastic! Three of us had bottomless mimosas, which were deconstructed so you could add as much OJ as you liked (they also had pineapple and white cranberry juice if you wished), and one of us had two different Old Fashioneds, both of which had a house twist and were really good. As far as food, the pancakes were good but were of course your typical tasty pancake. The meat dishes though... I mean to be fair they are a butcher shop. They know what the heck they're doing with the meat in their dishes. The steakhouse scramble and the shortrib hash were both great. Would rec and will probably come again!",

This is essentially the quintessential Vegas gem, proving that even though food on the strip is amazing, you clearly pay an arguably unreasonable premium for location on the strip. The steaks are all amazing, I stick to the hanger with horseradish sauce, but the rib-eye cap is worth a try. The wild mushroom soup here is delicious, it tastes of the forest infused with grandma's love! The arugula steak salad, diver scallops and drunken goat are great non-steak options. As for apps and sides, I suggest the bone marrow Asada, portobello fries, and octopus. Old menu items that no longer exist on the menu were there absolutely divine and cheaply priced squid ink seafood pasta and hanger steak sandwich (I implore them to bring these back after a few years of absence).   As for the steaks, they are really amazing here. The quality of the meat itself is what makes the restaurant stand out. The flavors and skill added to preparation are impeccable. I only note that Medium Rare here is more like Rare, so go up one temperature level from your usual when ordering here.   The drinks here are also top notch. I forgot his name, but there's a wonderful bartender here on Tuesday nights. He can whip literally anything you throw at him. Plus, the cocktail program has been great here for a very long time. The cocktails are well designed, well-poured, and well-priced.   The only thing I wished this spot had was a developed steakhouse dessert menu with classics like Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster. Maybe that's for the future?",

I work at a hotel near by and this is definitely my favorite place to recommend when guests ask for a dinner recommendations. I've had not one bad review of the restaurant.  The food is consistently delicious every time I have gone here. So just as a little about Echo & Rig, they actually butcher their own meats. They have special cuts for sale in their little shop on the first floor. They also have a bar on the first floor where you can also order from the full menu. Upstairs, they have indoor and patio seating. It's nicer outside during the summer nights.   Every cut of steak is delicious and well prepared, it is really up to your preference which cut you like. Some cuts are more thick, some thinner, some more fatty, some more lean, its up to you what you like. I prefer mines cooked medium rare, and they cook it just right, every time! I can't help but get the charred onion sauce for my steak. It's just so good! My favorite sides include the portabella fries, bacon, and the carne asada bone marrow. I can't wait to try their other sides when I come back.  I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is always delicious and the service is exceptional. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Can't wait to try it out for brunch!",

We sat upstairs on the patio where they had just installed new misters for these hot Vegas days. They even asked for our feedback on them, which was a nice personal touch.   Food: Drunken Goat Sandwich. YUM. If I see the word Brie, that's what I'm ordering. The sandwich had Brie, goat cheese, thinly sliced apples, cranberry chutney, greens, and some sort of aioli (basil I believe), and came with the apple and fennell salad. All the flavors came together so well and it was absolutely delicious. Portion was big but of course I ate the whole thing because it was great. They are known for their cauliflower which was delicious. It had a little heat to it from the peppers, but it really was the perfect amount of spice, and cooked perfectly.   We were celebrating a couple of special occasions which were recognized with some fabulous dessert, the turtle, and the berry/lemon. WOW the salted caramel ice cream on the turtle was some of the best ice cream I have ever tasted.  Thank you Nan for the great service, you made our experience an incredible one, and we will definitely be back to try more!",

Neat butcher shop on the bottom floor (wished I lived closer to pick up meat from them on a regular basis) & restaurant on the 2nd floor. The atmosphere is upscale but casual and friendly. We sat on the patio & immediately was welcomed to the restaurant by one of the managers (I assume since he was dressed to the nines in a pressed suit), Kevin, who was cheeky, friendly and had made his presence known that if we needed anything, we can request him. He also wished my husband a happy birthday as I made a notation on the reservation about the birthday. Then our server, Celine came promptly, welcomed us, explained the menu and then said she would bring by the meat tray (for the bigger cuts that could be shared) to show us. She was personable and friendly. Throughout the night, service was above par. Our drinks (soda, iced tea, water) were immediately replaced/refilled even though our glass were only half filled. Bread service came quickly & seconds were brought immediately.  FOOD - We ordered the fried calamari to start. It was, by far, one of the best fried calamaris we have ever had! The calamari was so tender (not rubbery) and the breading was lightly fried and not oily. We knew that we were in for some excellent food! - Husband ordered the Spencer steak (which is less fatty than the Rib Eye Cap), medium and it was cooked to perfection (outside charred and the meat was melt-in-your-mouth perfect); bernaise sauce was the perfect compliment. The Mushroom Rockefellar (that came as a side on all steak plates) was my husband's favorite (I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't see what the big deal was). He didn't really care for the garlic chips (he's not a big fan of chips) but they were crispy and not oily. - We ordered a side of the cauliflower and this was the BEST side dish I have ever tasted! The cauliflower was crunchy on the outside, slightly sweet with bits of crispy shallots/onions and sliced chile de arbol, which added a little spicy kick at the tail end.  - My daughter ordered the grilled cheese (with short ribs) and mac n' cheese. Grilled cheese was meh (nothing to write home about- I've had better) but the Mac n' Cheese was, again, one the best I have ever tasted! So creamy and no stringy cheese in the mix. I could've had that alone with the cauliflower and I would've been a happy camper!  Since it was my husband's birthday, Kevin offered us dessert on the house. He even sang happy birthday to my hubby, which made the hubby blush! LOL! We were so stuffed but requested sorbet & mixed berries to clean our palettes and end on a lighter note.   We will definitely come back to Echo & Rig every time we visit Vegas! It is worth every penny!",

For the sides, I would recommend the cauliflower, carrots, or the crab cake, but any side you get, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. We were given great service which I can really appreciate because I'm a server myself. Because we are a young couple, when we go out to eat sometimes I feel that other servers aren't attentive enough because they assume that we won't tip well. Our server Nick was awesome and helped us go over the menu since I'm always the indecisive one. He also gave us a complimentary sundae with a candle for us to share at the end. When we left, everyone was so kind including the manager and they all said goodbye and happy anniversary. So the next week came and we went in for round 2. The hostess and manager both recognized us and were happy to see us come back. They sat us at the same table and again, we were given the best service. Thanks to Xavier and his staff for being on point! This is now one of my favorite date night spots and I will continue to come here and will continue to suggest this place to anyone that has never tried it.",

    "text": "This may be the worst of both worlds as far as fine steakhouses go.  Even the most simple things are apparently extremely difficult for the wait staff to accomplish. A fine dining establishment needs two very important things in order to succeed: A great cut of meat, and great staff to prepare it and deliver it.  This dining establishment has neither (Unless I'm assuming you get their \"off the menu\" cuts which are priced around $3 an ounce).  I got the ribeye cap and the girl got the seabass.  Luckily her seabass was well cooked and nicely seasoned.  My ribeye cap was not flavorful and tasted of charred wood - as if you dropped a nice steak on the coals and served it.  Certainly left a bit to desire for a $30 steak.  Now the service.  There's the female manager, Lisa, who was very cordial when we first sat down, but would routinely come by our table, straighten the salt and pepper shakers and not say a word.  We did not receive bread. A couple of other tables did. It actually looked pretty good. To be honest I'm not sure what is complementary here.  I suppose it doesn't really matter.  It was almost as if after we ordered we were invisible.  Our server was not a fine dining server. He could not help me select a steak from their main dining menu but would suggest many times I get the 64oz tomahawk chop as of course it's the best that they have (and would cost around $192).  I ordered a cocktail and it went empty by time we finished our appetizers.  Not once did anyone in the establishment ask me if I'd like another. Never.  Our waiter would routinely come by our table, grab a plate or clean up something that we had dropped off our plate but not say a word. I'm not 100% sure how this place is still in business. These are pretty simple things for IHOP to do but a fine steakhouse cannot?  -Please spend your hard earned money elsewhere. If you have a gift card slap the person who purchased it for you. Echo and Rig is not even worth your time - much more your money.",

That is a great deal for the quality of food here.   We had 8 sides, 4 steaks, 2 spirits & 2 sodas.  That price includes tax and 25% tip.  The differences between this place and our regular favorite steak houses are that the cuts of meat are smaller here (which allows you to fully enjoy it and the sides) and the music was fun and hip and didn't make it seem like we had to be on our best behavior, although none the less of a fancy and classy environment.

Our server was knowledgeable about the different cuts of meats and could answer all of our questions with confidence. The entire waitstaff made sure our drinks stayed full, table clean, and oh my gawd to the cap steak and spencer steak! The best restaurant and service in Vegas that I've been to so far. This is a great place for a romantic date or to celebrate a special occasion.",

((Also, fabulous location ; Tivoli is such an inviting, customer friendly location with easy valet parking))    As part time Las Vegas residents we tend to find a few spots that become our favourites when we visit.....ECHO & RIG is our new MUST GO TO !!    I visited on Thursday eve for drinks & nibbles with a friend and was back on Friday eve for dinner with my husband.  Appetizers/ starters/ small plates - perfect for 2 people .  The portobello fries with herb aioli are amazing, the octopus & gigante bean salad ; sublime,  Over the moon salad - say no more  !!   and the \"fried spinach\" salad , unlike anything we have ever had; light spinach with a perfect combo of tangy & sweet & crunchy !   We had a NY steak to share -delicious !!  perfectly cooked (med rare), Our waiter had requested the kitchen slice it for us  which was perfect.  The entrance to Echo & Rig is elegant yet inviting with a small gift shop and gorgeous  butcher shop .  Every staff member I came into contact with was friendly & knowledgeable . Thor in the butcher department was delightful and his charcuterie plate : gorgeous & delectable !   I am looking forward to purchasing meats from the butcher shop to cook at home and also hear that there will be prepped turkeys to just \"pop in the oven\" along with every side dish imaginable ...THANKSGIVING made easy & delicious at home !   ***the  hand salt scrub in the women's  bathroom is glorious !  must purchase that on our next visit !    ((((Only 1 improvement that we (my husband noted)   bread be be served warm  !! )))",

I almost never get service that's good enough for me to remember the waiter's name, but Edward is the man. He charismatic and he somehow knows your taste buds better than you. He took his time on going over the menu and going over my personal preferences. He was very familiar with the items on the menu and mostly everyone went with his suggestions.   We ordered portobello mushroom fries (for friend), cream of mushroom soup (for me), and lamb sausage. The appetizers were delicious, there was enough batter on the mushroom to keep them less oily, the soup was creamy with hint of mushroom and other spices, but the best appetizer was the lamb sausage with dijon mustard.   I ended up getting the Spencer steak (Medium rare), with garlic chips, stuffed mushroom, and Brussels sprouts as an extra side. The steak was tender and it was cooked to my medium rare requirement. The sides were also great, but the main entree left the best impression on me. Overall its the best place to go eat in Tivoli village. The prices are more reasonable for the location of the restaurant and the service by Edward was one of the best in my life.",

    "text": "It was my birthday on Saturday and I decided to come here for dinner. I was dining alone. I walked in and was not greeted with even the vaguest semblance of warmth. Just a fake half smile by the two hostesses. I asked for a table for one, to which they replied \"Uh, ok...\" and told me it would be 30-40 minutes - but - I could wait in the bar. Or sit at the bar, because y'know, it's empty, there are tables and no wait. I felt like they were pawning me off to the bar. I didn't state I was going to sit there and eat but since I could wait at the bar, I thought I would since there are TVs.  I waited about half an hour sitting down, and then got up to stand behind the hostess station. I'm hard of hearing and I thought it would be better that way. (Reading so far, they didn't take my name which I thought was odd but who knows how they operate.) They keep glancing at me, but make no attempt to talk or ask me anything. At all. Another 30 minutes pass, and this small group comes in and actually gives their name. I finally ask about the status of my table. The hostess puts on a fake look of surprise and sympathy and tells me \"Oh, we thought you were eating at the bar!\" Uh, no. I stood behind you and practically stared you down for 30 minutes. She offers to take my name - but - then tells me there are two parties in front of me. ARE YOU SERIOUS??! You still make me wait after your mistake?  I wasted an hour of my time, on my birthday, whom I had no one to share with. On top of that, it was fucking cold as shit in the lobby. Do you even have heat?? I was livid, hungry, getting tired and freezing. I did wake up the next day feeling yucky because of practically standing outside for an hour. This was, by far, THE WORST, restaurant experience I have ever had. I can't imagine ever setting foot inside your establishment again.",

That being said my ribeye was cooked to Perfection absolutely top-notch perfect. Served with potato chips homemade yes garlic no and the onion char tasted nothing more than A1 /  Worcestershire sauce Cocktails were good a little small but they were quite flavorful. I ordered the crab cake it was delicious this was actually a crab cake with crab in it, was perfectly done. However the butternut squash which on paper sounded great was overdone squash under seasoned with a little tiny glob of some stratacella cheese it was supposed to have pumpkin seed and honey there was no pumpkin seeds in the dish and if there was honey it was undetectable. The jumping beef was barely edible, it just tasted  like Worchester sauce. it's really more like a soup with one or two pieces of meat, and they put french fries in it ? not really understanding the concept being this this is a  upscale restaurant. french fries come on some nice red potatoe fingerlings or something and remove the overdose of Worcestershire sauce. It really tastes like somebody just dumped a bunch of A1 sauce in some beef broth.  Took me all night to think about this. I really wanted a great meal for Father's Day and I figure d this was the place lots of my friends love this place and yeah there are a lot of 5 stars. I guess I could chalk it up to they had a bad night. Hopefully this is viewed as constructive criticism and is corrected by the establishment.",

And, ... that's it.  Positives: (1) service from Jason and Derek was impeccable. (2) food was phenomenal. (3) NO corkage fee, so we brought our own wine for no extra charge.  We had arugula salad that was delish. I had a 27-oz. porterhouse that was amazing with tasty white cheddar chunky mashed potatoes. Oh, and the crab cakes and calamari appetizers were awesome! Whew...I'm so full now. This place was expensive but still excellent value.  Thor in the butcher shop downstairs was a really nice and knowledgeable guy as well. Highly recommend E&R!",

The food kept me filled, however Hugo's entertainment kept coming, a priceless smile that will brighten your day better than Vegas, not to mention the glutes size of the sun!

Yah, you heard me.   \"But I like Craftsteak and Carnevino, and Delmonico,s.\"    \"Oooh, I like Prime the best. I get to see the Bellagio fountains when I smear the hostess a Benny and she lets me sit outside under those misters, so my GF thinks I'm a VIP\". \" The misters leave a fine dew on my Bosley-hair making it look thicker and more natural than it already is\".    \"I want to go to CUT. I heard someone once saw Wolfgang Puck there one time.\"    \"Can we go to Baazar by Jose Andres?? I heard there's lots of eye candy there\".   Been there, done that.   In the amount of time it takes you to walk your date from Lavo to CarneVino, (and for the same $'s) you could have Uber'ed yourself and three of your best friends to Echo & Rig in Summerlin to enjoy undeniably superior steak, more professional and friendly service, and personalized attention by management. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the price--about 1/3 of strip prices. And the eye candy?  Look at your plate, Einstein.   I know what you're thinking. \"I get comped and can order whatever I want at SW and they treat me like a high roller there when I flash my Wynn card. Makes my girlfriend with the fake rack and ass-sized lips all sexy inside.  I don't have to pay for MY steak when I go to Vegas and I know what's waiting for me after I loose my roll in the casino and stumble up to my 2,500 sf comp suite for sleepy time\".  GREAT point. For the rest of us, do yourself a favor and Uber up to Summerlin for absolutely the finest steakhouse and butcher shop in Vegas...and anywhere else for that matter. Anywhere!  Suggestions:  charcuterie, bacon, kale salad, Brussels sprouts, ribeye cap, 48-oz tomahawk ribeye, fried mushrooms, '08 Rioja Reserva. Home-baked bread and desserts.",

You should probably have a snack before you come or you'll be really hangry waiting for your food. - We saw Siegfried (without Roy) there. - The mac & cheese is the best I've had in a long time. Never had portobello anything, but the fries have opened my eyes--great dipping sauce.  The pumpkin squash is fabulous.  The garlic mashed potatoes are nothing special--you can skip them. - We will be back.",

    "text": "Echo & Rig got some love early from Yelpers.  Echo & Rig is a new steakhouse located in Tivoli Village.  Echo & Rig is one of those restaurants that is very welcoming.  What I mean by this is that it's wide open when you enter It's also spacious, clean, and your treated with smiles/greets.  But then there's a wait just to be seated and for them to take your order.  It was roughly 50 minutes between waiting for a table and taking our orders.  Another issue...we were a party of 4 and had to share the rest of our table with another party of 4.  We were asked if we were okay with it and we were...only because we didn't want to wait much longer. Enough said...Yes, there's a wait for a weekday night.    Our group ordered a mix of food.   -Mac & Cheese:  Pretty good stuff. Got the light creamy, cheesy mac here.  Love the thick macaroni too.   -Butternut Ravioli:  Buttery good  -Garlic Mashed Potato:  Yikes...not the best.  -Pumpkin Squash:  Amazing!  -Portabello Fries:  This was a good highlight for me.  Mushroom fries?  Yes sir!  -Bone Marrow:  I didn't try. So, I can't judge  -Fried Oyster Sliders:  My opinion, not a good mix.  I like oysters. I like sliders. But oysters and sliders together?  This just didn't mix well for me.  Slimy and greasy all in one bite.   -\"Over the Rainbow\" Salad: I'm not a salad lover, but couldn't help myself with their \"Over the Rainbow\".  Tasty and they even added quinoa. What is it? It's Queen-No.   Now for my main entree. I originally wanted to try their Spencer Steak, but was talked into the filet mignon.  Our waiter suggested the filet since it's supposedly their best cut and best tasting steak.  Honestly, I was not impressed with the filet at all.  I regret that I didn't ask them in advance how juicy a medium and how dry a medium-well was.  I usually get my steaks medium-well.  What I got was a filet mignon that was well-done at the top and medium on the inside.  I guess that's what Echo & Rig considers medium-well. I wasn't impressed, but the price was super cheap for a filet mignon. I guess I can't complain either.  You get what you pay for.   Filet Mignon:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=R12LqBIuxMU5OHwdkIbG3A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Sampling:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ecUEKvNTzxaQ2p7f7FhUOw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  A Must:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=o_qfuP0kwGtdGUce-WzVLA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Overall, I was very excited to try this place out due to the reviews, location, and it's steak.  I left with mixed reviews.  Long waits, average steak, but cheap with delicious appetizers. You win some, you lose some. I broke even.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (469/500)",

Came in friday night for dinner with reservations and no wait needed.  We were seated outside, right next to the heat lamp with a nice view of the plaza.    to start, drinks-  huckleberry gin with hot honey: beautiful color, spicy and sweet.  food: -grilled octopus with gigante beans and celery: the raw celery really stood out.  octopus was tender, but overall combo was ok. -watermelon tomato onion salad: refreshing and sweet -cauliflower with shallots and onions: sweet like candy! crispy and delicious. -ribeye cap: very flavorful and tender cut.  it was recommended medium but mine was definitely a medium rare.  comes with mushroom stuffed with bread crumbs and side of potato chips.   -spencer cut: friend got this and asked for medium rare, but it turned out medium.  less flavorful and a little tougher.  passed on desserts, which included a variety of sundaes. service was ok, nothing impressive",

Lunch favorites include, the burger, steak sandwich, and short rib grilled cheese all very good but my utmost favorite is the bacon lettuce and tomato on beef lard bread, 4 thumbs up yes I said 4, I borrowed my wives hands to help rate it 2 thumbs are just not enough.    My Cardiologist would disown me if she knew I was indulging so but what she doesn't know won't hurt me ;)  The steaks are all phenomenal I can not recommend one over the other as peoples preferences do differ greatly, I personally like the Spencer, old fashioned cut that I remember from my childhood so nostalgia even comes into play eating here.    The ambiance is very nice as are all the staff I have had the pleasure of being attended too by.  Oh they also have a great butcher shop that cuts meat to order and it is top notch aged prime meat, again have never had a complaint purchasing meat from them.  5 stars and 4 thumbs up I highly recommend.",

    "text": "First impression walking in, \"I kinda feel like I'm in a big city restaurant like Chicago!\"   We walked up to what looked like to be the butcher shop and put our name down and the gal said it was going to be an hour wait, makes sense considering it's a Saturday night. So we parked our behinds at the bar downstairs.   So, I have to mention this bc I felt a little awkward about it... There doesn't seem to be a dress code, but the majority of the people at this restaurant were little dressed up... I came in jeans, t-shirt, flats. Seemed like every female was in a dress and heels... Just had to put that out there bc I felt SUPER underdressed, but whatevs ;)  I wasn't really hungry but I had to try everything considering that the reviews on this place have been pretty good. Once our name was called, the hostess took us upstairs to the dining room.  The Eats: portobello fries, steak (can't remember what kind) and a few cocktails. I'm more of a side eater than I am main course, so my fav part was the portobello fries. When people say \"bomb dot com\", yea, that!  Being the restroom snob that I am, I have to say that their restrooms are big, clean and comfy! Good job!  This place is great for a date night, drinks and there were a few big groups so from what I could tell, they can comfortably accommodate larger groups.",

Once seated, the GM and wait introduced themselves to us and the hostess relayed the message that it was our first time. From start to finish the service was superb; and for whatever reason all the waiters look like models. (Not complaining). Once the bill was paid our waiter later found out we were celebrating an engagement. He then comped us a dessert and glass of champagne. I asked him to charge me but he insisted. My good gf and I were so impressed and I can't wait to bring others ... We shared the drunken goat sandwich (omg!!! So good) and the arugula salad, then finished off with their delish toffee icecream.",

I was in town for work with a group of ladies, and we made a last minute run to this restaurant - knowing it might be difficult to seat five with no reservation.  The friendly hostesses told us it would be a short wait, but they would find a table for us.  We were seated quite quickly, and visited by Xavier, the manager, and Jason, our server.  While we saw beautiful cuts of meat being displayed for tables all over the dining room, we quickly decided to dine tapas-style and order lots of small plates to share.  And while the cocktail menu looked fabulous, we decided sharing a bottle of wine would be more fun.  Our wine was delivered quickly, and our small plates started being delivered to the table.  We ordered the cauliflower, thick-cut bacon,  lamb cigars, butcher's sausage, baked brie, ahi poke, and the grilled octopus.  The conversation waned at that time because we were all thoroughly enjoying our food.  Xavier also kindly brought over an order of the fried spinach salad for us to try.  It's something I had never heard of and would never think to order, but it was insanely good!  We ran out of wine pretty quickly, and our amazing server Jason recommended a red blend from Browne Family - one of his favorites.  We insisted that he pour himself a glass and spend a moment with us, which he did in between running around attending to his other tables.  All in all, five stars - for the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  We travel to Las Vegas for work regularly, and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in Vegas so you better be on your A game. Echo & Rig really missed the mark last night. It started off great with James the manager coming by to welcome us to the restaurant along with our waiter Sam. Sam explained the menu and brought our their specialty steaks on a platter.   I went with the 19 oz prime bone-in New York and our table shared the mac & cheese and roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar. The rest of our table ordered their entrees and that would be the last time we saw Sam for a very, very long time. One thing I like at E&R is that you can order 1/2 glasses of wine if you want to sample a couple different glasses.  The drinks and bread came out pretty quickly, brought by two different people. The entrees and sides came out a little later, again served by someone else. I took my first bite and the steak had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper. After a coulple more bites my jaw was actually getting tired of chewing. It was one of the worst cuts of meat I have ever had. Full of gristle and really chewy. For a \"prime\" cut it was terrrible. The others at the table were enjoying their filets and fish however the garlic mashed potatoes were very bland as we didnt taste roasted garlic or white cheddar. I thought the mac & cheese was good though.   Sam never returned to check on us to make sure everything was ok and prepared properly. We had to flag down James and let him know about my steak.   James apologized and had a medium rare filet out to the table in about 1 minute. Excellent service which I truly appreciate. He also returned to make sure it was satisfactory which it was. The filet was very tender and had great flavor (and cost much less than my prime NY). Still no sign of Sam.  We all finished our dinners, had our plates cleared and were just sitting there waiting for the dessert menu. Again we had to flag someone down to find Sam for us. I ordered the salted caramel turtle sundae which was excellent.   Sam brought out the bill and I was a little surprised to see I was charged for the filet. I have absolutely no problem paying for what I ate, but in my business if a customer is unhappy you do everything you can to change that. I almost never send food back, so when I do it's a bad sign. Although I appreciate James quickly replacing my steak, the quality of the prime NY, the mediocre potatoes and the total absence of our waiter was a big let down.",

    "text": "Went here tonight for my son's 21st birthday, party of 5. We bought drinks, plenty of sides, a couple of salads, a salmon entree, and steaks. First let me say that they do have their service down pat- the hostess asks your name downstairs and notes any special occasions, which she then writes on paper that's handed to a manager upstairs and they stop by your table to thank you for coming, calling you by name.  That's a nice touch.  The servers seem very knowledgeable and the water guy was the most attentive service person on the team.  The food: the mushroom fries are dynamite, so good and we ordered two.  The cauliflower and brussel sprouts, also very good. The garlic potatoes were okay.  The salmon, my son said, was delicious.  Our vegetarians both got salads- the quinoa salad was so bland that we sent it back.  It was just not good. That person ended up getting mac n cheese and said it was great. The veggie salad with cilantro dressing was also good.    Now for my chief complaint and the reason that this steakhouse gets 3 stars... the steak.  My mom had a skirt, which she said was very good.  She ordered it medium and it came out almost rare- but it was so good that she didn't care.  I had a more expensive steak and it was possibly one of the worst I've ever had.  I would even have expected better from Applebees.  I ordered it medium rare, it came out over medium.  I brought it to their attention and they re-fired it- medium again.  The manager brought it out himself and asked me if I approved.  I cut into it and yup, still brown with barely even a hint of pink- so I said 'good enough, I guess'... Here's the thing: we can all see that there's no red in my steak- even the waiter agreed later.  I shouldn't have to feel forced to accept an over cooked steak because I don't want to seem like a pain and the manager should have known as soon as I cut into it that it wasn't right. Everyone in my party was finishing their meal and I wasn't going to ask them to fire another steak. So I eat it because I don't want to dampen the mood anymore than it had been.  Luckily the blue cheese sauce made it better, since the steak itself had no flavor.   Final gripe, my bill comes and they didn't take anything off for the poorly executed steak.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he basically tells me that they cooked it twice, that was enough.  Then he says that he'll see what he can do for me....  he comes back and they took $10 off my bill.  Thanks? Now it's just a $20 fail that I paid for, instead of $30.  Oh, and the garlic chips? I don't even want to think about how many of those that they must throw out, along with the bland bread and butter than another poster noted.   It's a shame too because I come to Vegas a lot and I wanted to find a great place to bring people.  The search continues.",

As I am not local, I am only familiar with strip and downtown areas and this particular time is usually open at restaurants where we usually go.  Upon approaching the hostess, she and two othe young girls were chatting away.  I stood for a second and then looked at me with irritation that I had interrupted their very important conversation.  She then asked me in a very brusque and unfriendly tone whether I had a reservation.  I was surprised and that had to show in my face.  When I responded no, she told me with great irritation that you cannot come to Echo & Rig without a reservation.  They had no seating for the rest of the day.  She then turned and resumed her conversation.  I do realize that a local spot may have a different traffic pattern than where I am sued to going.  But the rudeness and irritation that this girl showed was totally out of line.  We left immediately and I will NEVER cross their doorway again.  I will also tell my friends that visit from the strip to not bother taking the extra time to go to Echo & Rig.  We happened to be with a friend who works at a highly regarded local restaurant and she was quite stunned at the hostesses behavior.  If this is the attitude you get at the door, I question whether the press has gone to their heads and that the food may follow if it has not already followed the horrid treatment we received from this young girl.",

I had a Spencer cut...and I've hit a lot of steakhouses and never heard of it (it's the center, lean part of a ribeye steak). It was perfectly charred over red oak and perfectly seasoned.  Brussels sprouts were fresh and automatic. Only wanted to try to eat two bites of the cappuccino Sunday, but I ate the whole thing.  Not a Fleming's over seasoned but fresh True flavors.",

Very classy how they take your name and walk you to your table. All the meat comes from the butcher downstairs, so naturally we had to try the burger, which was recommended with cedar cheese.  This was an excellent, juicy, well put together burger. For $16 it is well worth the price.  We also shared some portobello mushroom fires - lightly battered server with an awesome sauce.  Our server was very attentive as well as Beth, the manager, stopping by several times to inquire not just on the food, but the experience.  I look forward to returning to try some steak!!",

For dinner we've had all their different types of steak and our favs are the filet mignon and their rib eye.  Side favorites include their Mac n cheese, the portebello fries (!!!), and their corn.  Today, we tried their Sunday brunch and like their dinner menu, everything is superb.  French toast was amazing, eggs Benedict sublime, and their short rib hash was definitely hearty. The ambience is light and bright and unlike most steakhouses.  And you just cannot  the reasonable prices. It's our very very favorite restaurant.",

    "text": "You will find Echo & Rig's bright sign shining across from Brio and next to the David Barton Gym in the roundabout area inside the beautiful Tivoli Village.  This place seemed busy from the get-go. My family and I had arrived 10 minutes late for our 8 o'clock reservation and was sat after a 15 minute wait. \"The first floor included a bar area (only enter if you are over 21 with an ID) and some round tables and chairs. It seemed like a waiting room. The music was already loud. There's a butcher shop downstairs as well.  Service 5/5 When we arrived at our table, we were quickly greeted by the manager, Jason, who was very friendly and explained that he liked introducing himself to people who have never ate at Echo & Rig before. Cool beans!   We were offered our choice of sparkling or flat water, complimentary, for each person at the table. Jason came back to explain the concept of the restaurant and a rundown of the menu and source of food (everything is fresh, basically!) Great information to know :)  Sam was our server and was very friendly as well. Not sure what my dad had asked, but Sam left and came back with a giant trey full of raw meat for the steak options. We ordered the Tomahawk steak, medium rare.   Food: 4.5/5 Not sure if they forgot the bread until last minute but the bread came a while after we ordered everything, very close to when the appetizers arrived. Anyhow it was still good as I was starving. The bread comes with very creamy butter.   Our appetizers came shortly after the bread. Per Sam's suggestions, we ordered the Watermelon Tomato Salad and Portobello Mushroom Fries.   The salad was very different -- yellow and red tomatoes mixed with sweet watermelon pieces topped with a vinaigrette sauce (reminds me of the sauce on mozzarella salads). I didn't love it but found it pretty good. May have to try it again for a real opinion.  The fries were delicious! The green sauce for the fries had a buttery taste to it that just fits perfectly with the mushroom fries.   Next came our entree. The tomahawk steak was done at the most perfect level of \"medium rare\" I have ever seen. My arms had hurt this today (lol arm day!!) so I had a weak grip on everything. Yet without using force, the steak was easily cut into pieces. The four choices of sauce were in the cutest little gravy cups. Great to have these four choices -- my family and I were able to try all the different sauces! The two dark ones I didn't enjoy too much (one was red wine I believe and the other had an A1 Sauce flavor to it). The two light ones were better (one had a slight cheesy flavor and the other had a very rich flavor I couldn't explain, but this yellow one was my favorite).   Accompanying the steak were the side dishes: grilled corn, roasted airloom carrots, and some chip dish I didn't particularly enjoy. The grilled corn was very rich in herbal flavor (something my mom didn't like at all). I'm indifferent about it... Would be wary with ordering this if you don't like strong herb tastes. The carrots were really good, fluffy and soft, with a slight burnt taste that made the overall flavor oddly delicious.   We ended our meal with one of each seasonal sorbet (and for us, the flavors were peach, blackberry, and grapefruit). Topped with real fruit, I loved this! On the downside, I came here for my birthday but I wasn't able to get a special dessert or anything :( but I can't get everything haha.   We shared all these dishes between four people perfectly and it was around $40 per person. Not too bad for the price!  Color me impressed! My first experience with Echo & Rig was quite positive. You can count on me to come here again for another occasion and bringing a fellow steak-lover.  --------------------------------------------------  BRUNCH REVIEW Bottomless mimosas and bloody mary option for $16, which is one of the more affordable bottomless options I've seen. It really was bottomless... our server, I forgot her name (but she was blonde), was so delightful and always made sure to fill our cup. In addition to that, she was hilarious and very interactive with our table. It was also great because they gave the orange juice and champagne separate, giving you the ability to make your mimosas just the way you like it.  My friend and I both ordered the steak scramble eggs and short ribs to share. Even though we both shared two dishes, we had leftovers. Both were good options though I would opt to try something else on the menu next time. The food is definitely a lot better for dinner but still great to try.",

My wife has had the salmon and the butterfish and she definitely prefers the butterfish, I've tried both and agree that the butterfish was tastier.    We've tried the brussels sprouts, portabello fries and proscuitto and grilled stone fruit appetizers and all were great.  My favourite was the proscuitto and grilled stone fruit.  Service has always been top notch.  This time I celebrated my anniversary with my wife and the staff definitely made our evening feel special, our waitress, Beth, was very professional and attentive and the manager came by a few times to check on us and to wish us happy anniversary.  We were  delighted when the restaurant treated us with a dessert to celebrate our anniversary.  I highly recommend this place for special occasions and for a great meal and dining experience.",

I had the traditional eggs benedict - cooked perfectly with added pleasure of spinach.  Husband and several others had their short rib hash which was amazing!  Beware the portion is huge - if we ever got it again expect we would split it. Bottomless Mimosas - thank you very much!  With fresh squeezed OJ and a decent champagne and truly bottomless - they just kept pouring and pouring them until you put your hand over your glass.  And it's super nice that they serve the OJ in a separate carafe so you can mix it to your liking - a nice touch. Lots of other yummy sounding things in the menu - if I lived in the area, suspect I'd come here often. check it out!",

    "text": "Straight hit, no miss.  Located in the Tivoli center off of Rampart and Alta, this meat house could not be in a better spot. Vallet is right outside, the butcher shop next door, and a beautiful shopping center to browse around. This is a 2 story restaurant with balcony seating upstairs.  This was a belated wedding dinner from our lovely maid of honor and best man Aurora and Michael, and I admit  a great choice. We walked in and was greeted by 4 hostess. Already reserved for a 6-oclock dinner, our table was well and ready upstairs  by their huge windows. Perfectly spaced tables, medium  low ambiance lighting, and uptempo music set the mood to the room. Servers were on their toes being attentive to their tables always on the move. Mellow fast paced.   Proud to say that Ramon was the perfect server. Aurora and Michael got us a (Nothing Bundt Cakes) wedding cake, and for no charge Ramon took it to the kitchen where it was kept for us until dinner ended. Ramon also gave us the 101 on all their different types of meat cuts and boy did we get a full run down.    What ordered: From the Steakhouse cuts 2 Rib-eyes 1 medium well (Mike), 1 medium rare (for me) 1 Rib-eye cap medium rare (wife) 1 Horseradish Crusted Butterfish  Sides/appetizers: Asparagus & Fried Egg Fried Calamari Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli Bone Marrow Carne Asada  Calamari, bone marrow, and fried portebello fries were served to us first. Oh my, the fries. Who would have thought that mushrooms make a good fry. Served with what looked like a avacado sauce, this app. was amazingly tasty. The marrow, mmmm mm mmmmm! The starters so far have set a great tone.   Tables cleaned after apps. were finished. New plates were set, new cutlery for the steaks, and yup, dinner is served.   \"Do you see the size of these asparagus?\" Thick, perfectly grilled/seared, with a perfect sunny side up egg to blanket them. The rib-eye nicely rubbed, served with house chips and a side stuffed portabello. At this point my shirt was soaked from all the drool coming from my watery mouth. lol.... The first cut into the rib-eye was buttery, and red just like I ordered, and that first bite, Oh my! The kitchen had to put me in the freezer after I melted onto their floor. It was that good. In fact the moment of silence throughout our table spoke for itself as to how good the food was. Their house chips by the way is \"A Maze Zing!!\".  All I can say is, I asked for a side of ranch/buttermilk, and this is the first time I eliminated a full rib-eye, side , and its flaky friends without having to dip.   Family + Great food + Ramon + Awesome service = 5 stars  Need to get your caveman on? This is your place.",

Ordered the tomahawk steak, portabello fries, arugula salad, and a couple other things that we forgot, but it made the rest of the trip back home to Pasadena feeling satisfied and enjoyable. Thanks to a great staff and GM.  They will make you feel at home. This place is just as good as Mastros in BH.",

This is normally our favorite restaurant, but for whatever reason the service was subpar! our waiter literally left 3 to 4 different times without taking the complete tables order. He was trying to do this thing where he takes the women's order first. Zigzagging from woman to woman getting their orders, 3 to 4 times he forgot to take either mine or another friends. We were not a large party, we had six people. On top of that three out of the six people had to send their  steaks back because they were undercooked. My wife ordered medium well and I came out medium rare. Any cook should be able to touch the meat and gauge weather or not the steak is medium rare or medium well. The disappointing thing is my wife had to sit there and watch everyone else eat. By the time her food came out we were all almost finished. So between the chef and the waiter I was really disappointed. The food is still good because the quality of the meat. When my wife went to the bathroom she heard a bunch of people complaining about the service and how long everyone's been there, not sure what was going on but I feel like I wasted 150 bucks.",

The tri-tip is melt in your mouth delicious, amazing staff and servers, we have gone with parties of 4 both times, so out of 8 of us, we have all walked away blown away.....the last time we went, for four of us, each with our own entree, and ordering 2 sides for the table (mind you, no alcohol), the bill (before tip) only came to $105!!!! Not anywhere near as expensive as it would have every right to be....its a must go in my opinion! between our trips, we've had the tri tip, the butterfish...(amazing),. the jumping beef, the grilled cheese, the salad, the brussel sprouts, and more....all delicious!",

So bad we could not even eat it.  The gravy had no flavor...did not even taste like anything.  The mashed potatoes were okay.   The cranberry sauce was fine.  The turkey was just Ok.  Sorry Echo and Rig but you were off the mark on this one.  The pumpkin pie crust tasted like a pre-made grocery store crust, but I must say I think the grocery store would be even better.   Had a meal before there that was great, not sure why this one was a total miss. Won't be ordering Thanksgiving dinner again.  A big disappointment and it was not cheap either.",

If you're lucky enough to actually speak to a reservation host she'll take your information and when you arrive you will NOT be on the reservation list !!!  The consistency of their food is hit and miss. You are much better off playing the billion dollar lottery and win.   If you have reservations for six or more people  you may get a server to take your order and  get it right and pay attention to you. Less than that forget it you're on your own.   If you looking for a ambience cafeteria style WITH LOTS OF NOISE this is the place for you!   The general manager and all his assistant are  brain-dead. !!! So DO NOT except them to act like real General Managers in a high quality restaurant.  This restaurant is fortunate  enough to be located in Las Vegas due to the multitudes of tourists.  Locals would never return for a repeat of this awful food and service.   CHECK ALL THE REVIEWS. It will save you time, Money and aggravation.  MR. Never Eat Hear P.S. I gave this place one star, because it's located in Tivoli. Thus way you could find other restaurants and have a nice dinner out!!",

Either way, she always leads me the right way with a cocktail, wine choice, and of course the food itself. The steak is so good and I have ordered it to share as an app when I wanted to try a new dish. The short rib hash is my fiance's favorite and I always steal a bite or two. One time I had the grilled cheese and dear god I couldn't finish it but I certainly tried! We ordered that to share last time cause everyone wanted some. I only had one negative experience at this place and it was with a large group and what seemed to be a new server. It won't stop me from coming back.",

We were sat originally near a door but Xavier thoughtfully offered to move us somewhere less drafty.  We decided a corner table on the patio under a heat lamp would be the most comfortable.    Ricky, our server, was very knowledgable on the menu and wine selection.  I am a server as well and I'll be honest.  I learned a thing or two from him.  We started with the pork belly which was out of this world.  For the main course my date went with Ricky's recommendation, the spencer steak.  She found it delicious but we both agreed my lamb chops were the best dish of the night.  We were both so impressed with the lamb that I put my knife and fork down and dove in with my hands.  We finished the night off with the shortcake and cappuccinos.    Thanks again Ricky and Xavier!",

The five people who ordered steaks received them overcooked or underdone. They were all sent back to be recooked, with the exception of one, who was too hungry to wait. My scallops were raw, but they did remake the plate and didn't charge us for it, which I appreciated.  Overall, I really appreciated that the management was super apologetic and tried to amend for the mistakes made, the service was friendly, and the sides/appetizers were delicious. But I just can't recommend a steakhouse who can't cook a steak, let alone serve burnt bread at a place that charges $30 - $50 per plate.  It must have been an off night, but it was really embarrassing and disappointing to recommend this place to our friends and the execution be so poor since we had previously really enjoyed the place.",

A beautiful staircase takes you up to a large open restaurant with a beautiful huge outdoor dining patio. We sat outside and it just added to the beauty. Austin, our server, was so accommodating and very informative. He took special care to make sure that my order was as sodium free as possible. The table bread was delish and the whipped butter was so light and just perfect. My 13yo ordered the grilled cheese w/short rib and 3 cheeses (he is a picky eater and he was in heaven), my oldest got the beef pot pie with the side of garlic white cheddar mash...both were terrific! I ordered the mache salad w/pulled white meat chicken (lemon dressing on the side) and the side of asparagus w/fried egg (ummm yummm!!) I will now add fried egg next time I grill at home. They went the extra mile and brought a fabulous complimentary turtle birthday sundae for my big guys birthday ...and it was truly divine! I cannot wait to come back again on our next trip back to Nevada!!",

Absolutely amazing from the ambience of the decor in the dining area, to the food presentation. It is extraordinary!",

The only thing that maybe could have been avoided was there was not really anywhere to wait, as the rest of the party hadn't arrived yet, and we had a large table upstairs. It was pretty crowded and busy, but hey, i guess that's a good thing!  The food was absolutely delicious and the bottomless mimosas are truly bottomless, and also delicious. Service was great, and the waiter was super attentive and accommodating to our larger group, especially towards the end with the separate checks.   I love how the use of different wood is used throughout the decor giving it a raw, yet sophisticated feel yet still hip and trendy.  I WILL be back for dinner and can't wait to see the ambience of the dining room at night!  I have a feeling it'll be amazing.",

    "text": "For my wife's birthday she wanted to find a steakhouse off the strip with food that is out of this word. She found it for sure. We made the reservation via Opentable, and they had plenty of openings even for a Saturday Night. We were a few minutes late, but that was not a worry and they were accommodating. The hostesses were friendly and nice. We had asked for a seat with a view and they didn't disappoint as we had the corner table on the balcony. As we sat down the bus boy and manager were there to greet us and to ask what water we would like.  Next came the waiter Ramon, who addressed the fact it was my wife's birthday while also wishing her a happy birthday. Knowing it was our first time they brought the display of meat and explained each cut. It was quite informational and helped decide what we wanted for dinner. After Ramon returned from dropping off the plate of meat we ordered our dinner.  Appetizers: Crab Crakes - Flaky, Fresh Crab, Moist, and smooth sauce Fried Oysters in a Jalapeno Maple Syrup Sauce - Cooked very well, lots of flavor, and the sauce was sweet and spicy Dinner Filet Mignon - Was cooked just a little above order, but the meat was a melt in your mouth good. Even better because it was cooked over the woodfire grill. (Note it came with inhouse made chips) Rib-Eye Cap - WOW. This was full of flavor, cooked just right, and again the woodfire grill made it just that much better.  During both the appetizer course and dinner course Ramon and the Manager continued to check on us ensuring we had everything we wanted at the time. Some of the best service I have had in a long time. I commend the restaurant for this. Sad to say you don't see customer service like this very often. Even the waiter who brought the drinks throughout the night was a kick and very professional. As we finished dinner we were treated with a Carmel Turtle Sundae. This was on the house for my wife's birthday dessert. The ice cream was silky smooth and full of flavor. The toppings were good, but we are not big on carmel. I had ordered a port with my dessert, but unbeknownst to the waiter they were out of that port. The manager and Ramon visited the table to explain and they were going to comp me an equal 20yr port. After getting the port, it too didn't disappoint. Their recommendation was spot on for a good dessert port. Lastly, as we finished up and headed out. I made sure to thank Ramon for a great dinner, but also the manager Celine. The evening was one to remember and we would recommend this steakhouse to anyone who is in the area.",

We were treated exceptionally well from the moment we walked through the door.  We did have a reservation, so we were seated immediately. Our server was Nicholas and he made the experience 5+ stars. He was polite and explained the entire meal to us in detail.   We ordered an assortment of smaller plates including the Bacon, Kale Salad, and Portobello Mushrooms.The bacon was the best small plate we tasted. The bacon was so smokey and delicious.  3 of us order steaks and 1 salmon dish. It was the best steak I have ever tasted. It was tender and cooked to perfection. We ordered carrots and brussel sprouts as additions for the table to share.   Nicholas even brought complimentary desserts of Caramel Truffle Ice Cream. The Ice cream was phenomenal and I ate the entire bowl of it.  You truly feel like you are the most important person to come into the restaurant and I truly appreciate the care they take of their customers. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely return.",

Recommend to get reservations otherwise you might not be able to get in  We try to get reservations on Sat but everything filled up so we got Sun instead I love their fried spinach salad since it is different and excellent. I don't think the salad offer from any places except this one. The calamari was also delicious but the bone marrow was mediocre and I don't know why many yelpers recommend that dish. It is different but I would never ordered it again since I feel I am eating a blubber of fat on my toast.  Rib eye got the smoked flavor but the meat wasn't soft.  For 37$ ribeye on their menu I was a little disappointed since I would expected it would be better than the rib eye  I make at home. They do have more options of meat on their tray but I am glad I didn't choose any of those since I know the cost will be more. My friend got snapper , she stated it was good but too salty  Overall it was nice , servers were very attentive but the steak was a little bit disappointed",

This has been a place that Jacob and I have wanted to go to for a while now and saved it for Valentine's Day.   There was not a Valentine's Day menu for this location, but that didn't both us as it gave us the opportunity to taste many items on their menu.   One thing to take note is, there is no corkage fee! So bring your own wine if you know exactly wheat you want to eat.   Because we tried so many things I would just like to shout out a few key items.  1. Those portabella fries are my favorite thing here and is my number 1 (Jacob would say it's his third favorite, but he isn't writing this :P) 2. The side of carrots (Jacob's number 1), they are super yummy 3. The bacon with BBQ sauce (Jacob's 2), that bacon is yummy 4. The charred steaks. They have a nice char on the outside and are True to their temperatures. I loved their creamy horseradish!!   We finished with the salted caramel sundae which was both fun and delicious. Sadly I turned away for a few seconds too long and Jacob ate most of it.   The service here is phenomenal. They try to leave you in peace and are extremely respectful, but we love talking to people and could see just how much the staff loves Echo & Rig as much as we do!   Happy Eating!",

The manager came over to greet us and wish us happy birthday and it was not forced or desperate. Prices were affordable and food was spectacular. Farm to table with an end to end butcher! Our total came to $101 after drinks, dinner and dessert for two. We were expecting to pay at least $250. Shout out to Beth! She was an amazing waitress and cared for our every need. Our glasses were never empty. Highly recommend the Bavette steak. A little smaller than most but the flavor was beyond anything I've tasted. Oh, and the mushroom fries we !

    "text": "This was our second time visiting Echo and Rig. Our first visit was so delicious, we were back for round 2 while visiting Vegas. This visit was not as amazing. The staff was attentive and incredible but my entree left something to be desired. Let me start at the beginning. Our crispy bacon appetizer was delicious. Crisp, as promised, with a delightful BBQ sauce. My husband ordered a medium-rare ribeye which arrived more on the rare side. He roughed it out because he's not a complainer. I gave the waiter 2 entree choices (horseradish encrusted butterfish or lasagne and he picked the former). It arrived VERY over done. The dried out fish totally overwhelmed the possible \"butter\" flavor. I got more sauce to help it out but it was very disappointing and I was super hungry so I managed to get it down. We were celebrating our anniversary that evening and they brought some delicious ice cream with chocolate and caramel bits for us to share. As for the ambiance, I know it's not the fault of the restaurant but sadly when people allow their children to run around a restaurant it detracts from my enjoyment. About half way through our meal, about 3 families arrived with children (who ran up the stairs and then over to the table yelling at one another then went for a bathroom break and walked out fairly calmly but returned like gangbusters sprinting to the table and shouting to each other). I don't know that I will rush back when in town again. It was not the sublime experience we had a couple years ago.",

I had dined here previously and really liked it. We agreed that Tivoli Village is great convenient location and that Echo & Rig was the place to celebrate.   Service here is A+. The greeter used our names repeatedly as did the server and restuarant manager who came by twice to check in with us and wish us a happy anniversary. Austin was our server and he was very helpful, pleasant and accommodating. I made it a point to remember his name as he knew ours.   The bottom floor consists of a swanky bar area and in house butcher where the meat is hand cut. Upstairs has both indoor and an outside dining patio with a great view of the roundabout and Brio restuarant.  I had the Spencer steak. Cooked to perfection and just as described by austin as being a lean cut of meat. Sides included Macaroni and cheese, grilled asparagus with egg & cheese topping, caesar salad. My plate had tasty homemade chips and a baked Portobello mushroom. My wife ordered the butterfish. Both meals were excellent!!  FYI, we did not order any alcohol with the meal, just 2 waters and a diet coke. Dessert was complimentary and consisted of a giant cookie broke in half with ice cream, sliced apples and fresh cream topping. Yummy!  I really feel that you get alot for your $ here and represents a great value for the experience for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. The ambiance is very upscale befitting the overall theme of Tivoli Village. We love coming here and we will be back. I recommend Echo & Rig. Give em a try. You wont be disappointed.",

Only 4 stars because the shrimp cocktail was disappointing.",

    "text": "Firstly, we dined at Echo and Rig for my husband's birthday, this was the first time he or I had dined here. I received a call confirming my reservation the woman who called (cannot remember her name for the life of me) she explained that our reservation was for 10:15am (we dined for brunch) and that we were allotted 2hrs at our table and then it was reserved for someone else afterwards (I was not informed this when making the reservation). She also stated that we had to pay together (which is fine) but would've been nice to know at the time of me making the reservation so that I could tell my guests, but no big deal.   So we arrive and they seat us promptly. We get to our table and it takes our waiter about 15 minutes to get to us mind you were only \"allotted\" 2hrs at our table so it's now 10:30-ish. Our waiter finally comes and, gets our drink orders and 5 of us order bottomless mimosas. Our mimosa come 10 minutes after ordering and once we got those we decided to just go ahead and ordered food because we didn't want to lose anymore time waiting...Quite frankly the rushed feeling is not enjoyable.  Anyway, bottomless mimosas to me means my drink is kept refilled until I call it quits or our allotted time was up. We were now 45 minutes into our first hour and still had not had a second refill on our bottomless mimosas.   Now the food wait begins...we did not get our food until half past 11, leaving us with eh 30 minutes to eat and finish our \"bottomless mimosas\"   Our food finally comes, the Caesar salad was the best thing about the entire experience oh and the sugar scrub in the bathroom LOVED that anyway, I assume the Manager checks with every table to see if our experience is going good, so he comes, he asks and I respond \"eh it's been okay\" and he says \"okay? What's going on?\" And I explain the issues with the time and the lack of what we're paying for and the over feeling of being rushed so he says he'll get the waiters over to take care of the of refills on our drinks and he will get us dessert and take care of a \"few things\" on the bill.   So the bill comes and nothing, no sort of discount, NOTHING. So I ask our waiter and he says \"he took care of the desserts for y'all.\" Desserts we hadn't planned on getting? Oh great that was so generous of him. So by the end of our dinning experience we had 4 mimosas, I had 5 because my husband gave me his, free desserts, and a sour taste in our mouths about Echo and Rig. Heard great things about this place but my experience definitely didn't live up to that.",

When you walk in, you'll see a bunch of meat for sale, all properly labeled (this place is also a butcher shop!). Reviews say they're all great, but I have yet to try as I only came for brunch.   For brunch, I really enjoyed the NY egg breakfast sandwich (only $7!) and the short rib hash. Both were super delicious and full of flavor. The short rib wasn't too dry, and I really felt as if I was getting quality food with each bite. The workers and managers were all very attentive and friendly, which I really appreciated as well.   All in all, I felt like the NY egg sandwich was still my favorite. The egg was runny, and the bread was so soft. I would not hesitate at all to come back!",

The bonus? It is reasonably priced on top of serving meat from cattle that is not given antibiotics or hormones and is grass fed.",

    "text": "We've been here only once - yesterday, and it immediately became one of our favorite places to eat.  Me and beau had a date yesterday, which we didn't really plan ahead. So when we decided to go out all of a sudden at 5 pm, we remembered that we had echo&rig listed in our to try collection forever. We called and made a reservation for 7pm, I liked how they asked if that was a special occasion. We arrived at 7pm and were escorted to our table immediately. Water and bread were served fairly quick. Bread was good not warm, which is a shame. It would taste amazing if it was! We ordered drinks - vodka and tonic for my gf and lemon drop for me. They prepared everything but served us our drinks at our table, which was cool. Live entertainment lol Then we ordered food - Caesar salad, portobello fries, ribeye steak medium well with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and spinach - all to share. Timing for everything was PURRRFECT! We got our salad and portobello fries first. First thing that I loved was that they split our salad for us. I love when restaurants do that - it's so simple yet it shows impeccable service and class! They didn't bring our main course right after we finished our apps, which was perfect and very thoughtful. We had time to digest our food a little bit before being served more. I think there were good 10-12 minutes before they brought our dinner - it was perfect! Anywho, they brought our steak. It was perfectly cooked, it had a nice crust and it tasted charcoal (in a good way). Meat was tender, edges were crispy. I enjoyed EVERY bite! Mashed potatoes were bomb! Spinach was also really good. I liked that it didn't even look sauteed - it was pretty crunchy :)  All in all, everything was great - service, food, ambience!  5 stars for every single thing we ordered including drinks - everything was high quality, flavorful, and simply delicious.   We can't wait to be back! P. S. I took photos of apps but once I saw the steak.... My mind went blank - so no photos of the steak and side dishes peeps lol",

    "text": "It has been years since we went to Echo & Rig, so time for an update. The last time was for a late Happy Hour, which no longer exists :(  We skipped the Cinco de Mayo street food crowd, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The hostess didn't ask if we wanted to sit outside, but led us right to the balcony. The weather was simply perfect for an al fresco meal. The chairs would have been comfortable if I weren't longitudinally challenged, but the loose cushions were a big plus, and I was able to make my own booster seat!  Our waiter, Ryan, was the best - attentive, smart, and considerate of our less-than-lumberjack appetites.   This is the only restaurant where I've seen the term \"half glass\" on the wine list, so I had to ask. It's a 3 oz. pour, and the explanation made a lot of sense. I had a glass of cava, though. I love my bubbly!  We shared an Over the Rainbow salad, a hearty mix of farro, quinoa, veggies, and nuts. The kitchen split it for us, and I was full before I finished my half. I was glad we'd decided to share a sandwich, the hanger steak. Neither one of us could have handled a second one.  We loved our meal, but I do have two nits: both the bread served before ordering and the baguette for the sandwich had soft crusts. I know that bread with crunch is sorely lacking in these parts, but some restaurants have managed to do it. Echo & Rig should, too.  The second complaint is that the steak, while tender, was way oversalted. We should have asked for no extra salt, but forgot. I also learned that one of the seasonings used is tallow; that's beef fat, and I wish I didn't know that; I feel my arteries clogging just to think of it! We were surprised to find that the sandwich came with fresh chips; they had salt, of course,  but not too much, and the delicious crispiness was welcome.  At the end of our dinner, which was shortly before closing, we had a terrific discussion with Ryan about the state of our country, and he got extra brownie points for being on our side of the aisle. I love it when servers interact with us instead of being automatons, and this was another layer of praise for the overall fine meal we enjoyed. We won't wait so long to return!",

Bathrooms needed attention as there was no toilet paper in the stalls and the soap needed to be refilled.   I did love the ice cream they brought me as they sang happy birthday (a toffee ice cream, yum!). Their Bloody Mary is one of my favorites with garlic pieces in it! Will come back again soon.",

    "text": "So sad that this place has drastically decreased in quality and service. This was seriously my favorite restaurant in town and a place that I've recommended to so many people. Not anymore. Had a pretty bad overall experience today.   PROS 1. Drinks came quickly  2. Short rib hash and salmon lox was pretty good  3. Beth was a good server when the busy rush died down a little bit  CONS  1. Nasty thick hair on the rim of coffee 2. Took forever to place our order 3. Received one of our menu items at the end... everyone was already done eating.  4. The salmon Benedict (which I usually LOVE) tasted like it was sitting out for a long time - the pancake hash tasted so old 5. The last menu item served was the French toast because they forgot about it.. so they obviously rushed it because the inside wasn't cooked at all. It was basically custard... that's not how fresh toast should be.  6. They said they were going to box up the short rib hash and we never got it. They threw away our food? 7. The portobello fries were NOT fries. They changed the way they cut the mushrooms? Or they were too busy to cut them properly?  This was my favorite menu item and today was such a disappointment.  8. The sausage was gross and had tiny hard pieces in it. I could barely chew it and I held my breath to swallow.   It's pretty ridiculous that there were multiple reasons why today's experience was so poor. The manager did take care of some items on our bill. Thanks for that, but I doubt I'll ever come back.",

He was fun, entertaining, and professional all at the same time.  The food however for some interesting issues during our service. To start, the kitchen switched the requested temperature for the two steaks. The waiter was nice to get that issue fixed and offered upgrade to our meal. The dessert (cappuccino) supposed to come with cakes, but it was missing. Again, the waiter fixed it by bringing some over after we destroyed half of the dessert.  Aside from the slight issues during dinner service, the food taste itself was decent. The sauces were great addition and the pricing of everything seems very reasonable.",

Every staff member, from the hostess who laughed at our jokes, to the manager who personally introduced himself to us, to our server who had phenomenal recommendations...all treated us with kindness. Our server was Jesse was impeccable and exhibited professionalism and a relaxed vibe...a fine line that not many can walk. The food was delightful, filling, and well priced. We would drive back to Nevada from Southern California any day just to eat here. Thank you to everyone for making our experience so amazing.",

After seating and water being provided, we ordered drinks and a side of bacon (you know, the melt in your mouth house special) and WAITED...and WAITED... and WAITED.  Bacon finally showed up from a very nice man, not our waiter, but drinks never did.  Nice man got us our drinks and we ordered another side of bacon.  Our waiter came and finally took our order.....and we waited, and waited, and waited.  While waiting one of our party ordered another cocktail which didn't come until we were 1/2 through eating our meal.  Wanted to order dessert and the table was cleared, but our waiter never came back to ask if we wanted dessert.  We finally waived him over and after finishing his conversation with another wait person came over.  When we finally got the bill.......surprise.....it wasn't ours and so we had to wait, again, for the right one.  Guys, get your stuff together.",

    "text": "I've had Echo & Rig book-marked as a place to try on my Yelp for awhile, and we finally gave it a try today.  Came here for lunch and there was no wait.  The layout of the restaurant is nice.  Downstairs is the butcher shop area, the reception, and a bar.  Upstairs is the actual dining area where there is indoor and outdoor seating.  I like how it's very spacious and airy upstairs.  The service we got was great.  Our servers were nice and just attentive enough.  Now on to the food.  My friend and I ordered:  Sweet First Cauliflower - Tasty!  Just had the right amount of crunch and saltiness to it.  We really liked how the sliced chilis complimented the cauliflower.  Bone Marrow Asada - A-Ok.  One of the toasts we got was burnt on the end (..BOO! to them for not replacing it).  This was the first time I've had this type of dish before.  I saw the pictures on yelp of others raving about the dish.  But overall it was just OK.. not worth a repeat order.  Black Spaghetti - my main dish.  Not quite what I was expecting.  The broth was a bit too tangy for me.  Pasta itself as well as the seafood (which was shrimp, calamari, and mussels) was not bad.  But I was disappointed overall.  Won't be order this again.  Trenne Pasta - this was my friend's dish.  Much tastier than mine.  I had no clue what trenne pasta is and therefore did not know it was suppose to be a crunchy texture.  I didn't care for the crunchiness of the pasta but I did like the prime rib eye and tuscan black kale that was part of the dish.  Overall - I would go back.  The prices are overall are reasonable.  Staff was nice and the restaurant itself is lovely.  Next time I will order some  kind of steak.  That will be the make it or break it deal of whether or not I will make future repeat visits.",

We walked in and were greeted by a friendly staff.  Behind the hostess stand we saw several butchers working on a hind quarter of a cow.  Wow!!  What a great visual for a steakhouse!!  We sat upstairs in the patio overlooking Tilvoli Square and it was impressive... But would the food live up to the hype??  We started with the charcuterie plate, beef tartare, and bone marrow carne asade and they were all excellent.    Some of our kids ordered the BLT and they loved it.  The adults ordered several different cuts of steak and it was all very well done.  The spencer cut was especially delicious.    We ordered the portebollo fries, fried peas, and brussel sprouts for sides and again...all were delicious.    What an outstanding addition to the neighborhood.  We will be back and we will most definitely recommend to all our friends!!",

And i think that any place that specializes in meat should at least cook a med rare steak right? And we got a charcuterie thinking it was going to be good. But the pate was not spreadable and everything was flavorless and tasted the same. Bleh!!!!! Lastly open kitchen means I can see your asses eating from the service station.

When we got to our table we could tell that our server was busy (it being a Saturday night) but he was knowledgeable and quick to assist us. All of the  staff was great, but the food was not.  We had the steak tartare and crab cake to start. The crab cake was served lukewarm with a cold center and need more sauce. The steak tartare was the worst I've ever had, the texture was not good, it was very chewy and the only flavor it had was from the capers. The good news is that the steaks didn't disappoint, and I was a little worried after the below average appetizers.  I enjoyed the hanger steak with 2 of the steak sauces and my husband had the Ribeye. They were delicious! The mac and cheese we ordered with it was just ok. Overall the Service and the steaks were great, everything else was just alright.",

However, we ordered the porterhouse medium rare and it came out with a cold center. That was our only complaint. The small plates were all so good. My favorite was the risotto and the thick cut bacon. My boyfriend really enjoyed the crab cake. Overall, this was a great dinner and we would definitely come back.   Now for brunch, we ordered the eggs Benedict and the smoked salmon Benedict with a side of thick cut bacon, obviously. My boyfriend had the Bloody Mary and he loved it. Both of the benedicts were amazing. I especially loved my salmon Benedict. The best brunch in Las Vegas. I can't wait to come back and sit outside in the patio!",

We ended up getting drinks at the bar but waiting that long with a reservation is ridiculous. Why bother making one if you're going to wait? We ordered our food. It took another 30-40 minutes. The food was delicious (ribeye, portabella fries, butterfish) but I don't know if I would return somewhere you have to wait a really long time for a reservation and food brought to you. My friend went on a previous occasion and had to wait an hour for their food. I would probably give it five stars if it wasn't for the long wait.",

Balcony seating is worth the wait especially now that the weather is perfect. Service is super amazing and very down to earth. The portobello fries is a MUST to order. Short rib hash for brunch is a MUST. Any of their steaks are delicious and their sauces to choose from are delish. The environment is very welcoming as if you entering someone's gorgeous home. Extra fun fact is in the bathroom, they have this hand scrub u put on and leaves your hands super soft and pleasant. This place has a casual feel but with a 5 star experience. Best deal for locals on the bottomless mimosas. Only $16 bucks. The way they serve it is really cute as well. I added pics of it and also my hash. Never can go wrong with those 2 choices. Been here like 5 times and every time was an amazing experience. The manager even came to our table and introduced herself. They really treat their locals like royalty.",

My grandma ordered an appetizer that neglected to come out with the other appetizers. We had to ask twice before it finally reached the table. And then. Oh my goodness and then. My girlfriend ordered the brisket and it was too dry. Like chalk. (Which is weird bc it is typically perfect.) so she sends it back and orders the filet medium rare. It comes out medium and she's unhappy with it. She basically tells them, in the nicest way, that she loves the restaurant but she doesn't want anything else. She's really frustrated because it's our favorite place and the food is always good. He manager took AMAZING care of her and brought her a new one to surprise her and it was perfection. His service was exceptional and we could really tell how much he cared. He made the whole bad experience into an amazing one. And we will absolutely be going back specifically because of him.

We had a big group of 9 people and were seated outside that had warm heaters on.  Like many yelpers say, the Portobello Fries were heavenly and also the pork belly was glorious as well. It does take awhile for the main steak to come out, so make sure to grab one of these appetizers to munch on. By the time we got the steak, we were already starting to get full, so it was quite a challenge to finish our steaks.  I really want to emphasize on the excellent quality of service Echo and Rig provides for the customers. We were checked by the floor manager numerous times and every servers treated us like VIPs every time they came by. They certainly provide better service than most high-end restaurants without charging too much for the food.  If you want to experience what good service is for a reasonable price, go check out this place!",

It's a drive from The Strip in what seems to be an up-and-coming area of town. Great shopping center that it was in. When I walked in and told them my reservation, they led us upstairs and made conversation on the way - and remembered it later on - which to me is high quality service.  The waiters are introduced to you and are there for questions.   I got the Spencer Steak after asking if the description was related to Jocko's Steakhouse in Nipomo and they said yes (which is also a great steakhouse, but in a very different way than this place). The steak was huge, I didn't really even need the chips and mushroom it came with, especially after splitting the mac n cheese.   Again, amazing service, delicious food, and surprisingly reasonable prices. Upon walking out, I was handed a business card and they referred to me by name saying if I came back again, to give them a call. I assume this is the \"club promoter\" aspect that is prevalent in Vegas, but it was nice to know that they did care how your experience was.",

I had a craving for steak, but didn't want to shell out $100 at one of the super fancy steakhouses. Something about Echo and Rig rang all the bells for my desires.   I rolled into the restaurant, which has a bar and a butcher shop downstairs. There is a main dining area upstairs, but I settled into the only seat open at the bar, between a visiting guy from Texas and a retired Navy lady living locally. They both were very friendly, which makes eating alone a little easier. I ordered up a Stoli cranberry which was made with white cranberry juice providing a little sweeter taste and a nice change from the routine red one. A brief look at the menu brought me to the Spencer steak, which my new friend from Texas was enjoying. He has a cattle farm and raved about the steaks here, so I simply followed his recommendation. Good choice as the steak was prepared perfectly medium rare, served with my choice of sauce (bernaise), a stuffed mushroom, and some potato chips (this I would have preferred the choice of a baked potato). Plenty of flavor in the steak, a little salty but then I\"m one of those who never salts any food. A delicious meal it was for a nice price of $26.   I\"ll try a few more meals here. You should give it a try too.",

Your dog will love you for this.  2. I had always wanted to make pulled pork and the butcher was kind of enough to butcher a pig for me AND write out very detailed instructions for an upcoming dinner party that turned out to be a culinary success.  3. Order the short ribs on their brunch menu. It never disappoints.",

The service was incredible (shout out to Amanda who was such a doll) and the food was so amazing. We started with the fried calamari and crab cake, which both tasted very fresh. For our meals, we had the Filet Mignon and the Spencer Steak, paired with mac -n- cheese and the cauliflower. There was so much food, but it was all prepared impeccably! They even brought us an anniversary dessert, which was similar to a berry cobbler. It was a very unexpected, but very kind gesture. It speaks to the service that this company stands for and the overall experience we had at this restaurant.   It was an incredible experience and we look forward to our next visit!",

    "text": "Loved it! 4 stars instead of 5 because the wait was so long. I think my friend and I waited about 45 minutes for a table for two - late dinner, on a weekend. We sat by the bar and had cocktails while we waited so it wasn't too bad. I was a little annoyed when our table was ready. The hostess came over to tell us but we still had to close out our tab with the bartender. He was quite busy tending to everyone else so we had to wait a bit and the hostess didn't look too happy about that. Oh well.   We decided to order a bunch of the small plates since we weren't too hungry and neither of us wanted to gorge on giant steaks. We got the bone marrow, Mac n cheese, broccoli, and steak tartare. They came out all at once, and pretty quickly. It ended up being way too much food for the two of us but definitely worth it. Anyways, as we were working our way towards clearing the plates, one of the bussers came over to take an empty plate.... And ended up taking away all our plates! It was extremely awkward because my friend still had her fork in her hand, eating off her personal plate (which he took away). There was probably some miscommunication but the whole thing was a bit awkward. Our server's great personality outweighed the awkward experience. He convinced us to get dessert so we ordered the cappuccino sundae. It was way bigger than I expected and oh so delicious!!   I'm definitely coming back here again. Maybe not on a busy weekend night. I loved the atmosphere and the food was great. I think our entire meal was around $40? Great deal in my book :)",

This was the experience I was hoping to have when we dined at MadeLV that is located across the street from Echo & Rig.    My wife ordered the filet mignon with bearnaise sauce and it did not disappoint.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I ordered the ribeye cap and I highly recommend that.  It was so good, I didn't need any sort of sauce for it.    We recommend the cauliflower, portobello fries and the steak tartare.  All were delicious and all were a great compliment to our steaks.    This place is definitely going to be on our rotation of \"go to\" restaurants.  We will come here again without any hesitation!",

For a place that prides there steaks the cook compleatly dried/burnt/ over cooked every single steak that came out. The waiter had an ugly attitude and wouldnt stop sighing and shaking his head. There are no appetizers, I would greatly recomend to add that to the menu...we ended up starting with some orders of sides, the cigars are awsome!   The only reason this is not a 1 star is the owner of the place seems to be a very nice man, came and sat in our table and told us a little about him and the place. Second, the prices are fairly reasonable.   Overall, I dont think I would go again....might have been a one time glitch on many levels as I heard great stuff about these guys",

We were seated in the dinning area and I noticed a few things that initially put me on high alert. The wait staff situation seemed chaotic. I saw some dishes sitting under lights for a long period of time and just a bit of general uncertainty. Usually warning signs to me.     However the floor manager managed to ensure our service was prompt and took the orders himself.  The menu was simple but everything sounded so good it was hard to make a decision. I ordered the kale salad, with goat cheese, the salt and pepper ff and brussel sprouts. My friend got the bravett cut steak. Our food arrived hot, and in a timely fashion. I am thinking about going back today for the salad it was so good. The ff and aioli were just perfect. THE STEAK ..... Seriously one of the best tasting and perfectly cooked steaks I have ever tried. Please try this place if you like steak.       The only reason it got 4 stars was the chaotic feeling around the open kitchen and the stuffed mushrooms that showed up with the steak. Two small details that made it less than perfect but that food tho!",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. When we first arrived, I could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. Our water came out quickly as well; I chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. After this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. About fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. Considering how long it had taken, I assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. The drinks came a few minutes after; I felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.  As appetizers we had the portobello fries and fried spinach salad. In retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but that was our fault not theirs! Both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced.   For the main course, I ordered sides only as I am a vegetarian. I found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; I didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. I had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. Both were excellent. My boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  We also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; I really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. If you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh!   They brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy.   Overall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. We both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. Our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. The busser Enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad I remember his name but not the waiter's name! Enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.     Overall we gave the service 3 stars and the food 5 stars. The price was very reasonable. We will be back to try it again, but hope to have a different waiter!",

I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time and it did not disappoint. Brunch was absolutely delicious (had the steakhouse scramble) which I mean who can go wrong with filet in their eggs? A side of the watermelon tomato salad and the Duck Duck Goose as my drink sealed the deal. Not to forget about the desserts. Wow. On a consensus both of my friends and I decided we were going back for dinner.   For dinner we shared small plates and a steak and it was not only delicious but just enough to save room for, um, more desserts.   Food aside, the staff truly loves this restaurant and what they do. Everyone was incredibly nice and enjoyable to converse with. From being in the industry before, I have never seen such a passion and dedication to the food and service anywhere else.   Going back again this weekend, that should explain it.",

The service was great and the mimosas were flowing.  I chose the Steak frites ($21). I figured it was the best choice at a place known for its meats.  The steak was seasoned great, cooked medium rare like I asked and the flavor was delicious.  The downside was that it was very small and I could only eat about 3 bites because the rest was fat and gristle. The fries were very good, though it did not fill me up.  My friend loved her smoke salmon but the guys said their Steak Scramble fell flat. Eggs were not fluffy and very rubbery.  Luckily we ordered dessert (apple pie and the turtle) and due to an order mix up got a free cherry berry ice cream dish too. All three were delicious and we scarfed them down.  We really had a great time and the mimosas and dessert were delicious! The service was fantastic too. Our waitress was engaging and funny. Just wish the steak was better considering the place.  Haven't given up on it, maybe dinner is better.",

    "text": "So I happened to be visiting a friend in town and he mentioned that I get off the Strip and come check this place out for brunch. To start, as soon as you walk in the front door you notice right away they have a full butcher shop in the downstairs area of the restaurant. The had a full range of options from pork, beef, and an assortment of poultry. They do all of their cuts in-house which was a great sign for a steakhouse. We were greeted enthusiastically by our hostess and then taken upstairs to the outdoor patio. Their menu for brunch is very well thought out and had a wide range of options with some fun interpretations of classic dishes such as their egg scramble but they add in house-made sausage, filet minion, potatoes, tomatoes and burrata cheese. I decided to go with their steak frites, a hearty potion of their rib eye, shorestring fries, and a fried egg. After my first bite of the rib eye I know I'll be coming back here for dinner service. The rib eye was cooked a perfect medium rare, an abundance of fat marbling creating one of the most tender and juiciest steaks I've had in a while.  They also have quite an extensive drink menu with a great range of wines, beers, and craft cocktails to choose from. We decided to go with the bottomless mimosas and gosh were they generous. They kept our glasses full the entire time, used fresh OJ along with a decent champagne, and topped them with Maraschino cherries. Service was top notch, we always had people checking in on us, clearing our plates, and offering very helpful knowledge on the menu. They were a little busy so even the manager came over to help our her staff which is a great thing to see. All and all can't wait to come back!",

For brunch I always go with the short rib hash and bottomless mimosas. If you haven't been here you have to try it at least once. But it's so good, I guarantee you'll be back again and again.",

    "text": "We were looking for another steakhouse off the Strip. We haven't found one downtown that was exceptionally good or worth the high Strip prices. Echo and Rig fills the bill for us. Quality was very good, prices were in line with what they should be, service was good to excellent. One thing that impressed both my wife and I was the appearance of the wait staff. Traditional black pants, white shirts and whlte aprons....but neat, clean, well-groomed. Polished shoes, even! You know how it is in most places......billboard style tattoos, no shave for 2 days, generally sloppy look, etc. like no one cares as long as the prices qualifies for a bigger tip. There was almost a military crispness among the staff. Kudos to management.    Menu was fairly complete.......limited, but not in a bad way. I had wild mushroom soup and shrimp/artichoke /lemon butter capers. Very good! Wife had fried portobello mushrooms and a steak. also excellent. No room for dessert and some of the steak will be tomorrow's lunch.   Will we go back? Of course. One of the floor manager\"s thanked us as we were leaving, (Kevin) and asked if we ever needed anything special, to call ahead. He even gave us his home phone number. Quality service and dining experience at respectable prices. (Probably one third lower prices than downtown) We weren't expecting the reasonable price, but it is a bonus with the quality of food and service.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise.  I've been to Echo & Rig only once, but the overall experience will undoubtedly keep me coming back.    For starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the Asst. GM.  The staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  The dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes that were recommended to us were exceptional.  Another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for what they produce.    On to the meal: The restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  This is a nice touch, one I wish more restaurants would adopt.  Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli They call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item that was recommended to us.  We were not let down, the fries were delicious. They're not too greasy/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.    Steak Tartare I love a good steak tartare and Echo and Rig deliver a great version.  The dish is well balanced and the toasted bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  The caper/beef combo is so delicious.    Brussels Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon This was probably the most basic item we ordered, but that in no way is a criticism.  In comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which I often welcome in a vegetable dish.  Great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.  Fried Spinach We were about to order the Arugula Salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the Fried Spinach.  This is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  Flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   Throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  The vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  Bravo.  Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol, Crispy Shallots & Onions Another impressive and inventive dish.  The cauliflower almost tasted candied.  There were so many layers of flavor and texture, I'm not sure I can do a technical description any justice.    The Spencer Steak This was an excellent cut of meat.  Cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  We sampled three of the steak sauces - Charred Onion, Red Wine Demi and Brandied Mushroom, which I liked in that order.  I didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. The mushroom Rockefeller was so good.    DESSERT - Caramel Turtle Another staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  Their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.    On top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  I don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  It's a very smart concept and one that surely adds to the culture of the restaurant.  On my next visit, I'll likely take home some cuts of meat and WOOD (assuming it's red oak), for my home BBQ.    I look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes that I was simply too full to order.",

Attentive, friendly, genuine and well informed. Robert the manager came over and also introduced himself and ensured we were comfortable with the menu.   I ordered a glass of wine and when it came out I thought it was corked or the wrong vintage. Just didn't taste right. Ricky told Robert, Robert checked with the bar, and then he came over and said they had just opened the bottle two seconds before it was poured and recommended I wait a few minutes. So I did, so it was, and everything was stellar.   One of my favorite places in Vegas period. Classy without being pretentious, beautiful without being intimidating, gourmet without being overpriced.  Also, if you feel like getting a fantastic piece of meat to take home and cook yourself, this is definitely the spot if you don't have a local butcher to consult. These people know their protein something fierce.",

Manager Beth and her staff set themselves apart from almost every other service staff I've ever seen in efficiency, generosity, and unflinchingly warm customer service. When faced with a hungry 1 year old, they offered berries before the water even came to the table. Beth always stops by to say hello, and despite a city of 2 million people- I'd swear she genuinely remembers me every time. They KILL IT with AMAZING SERVICE.  Now the food- well, you've died and gone to heaven. If the meat seems a little heavy- have a salad-- they are just as amazing as any of the entrees. From the butcher to the bathrooms, this is a not-to-be-missed dining experience.",

    "text": "I'm so jealous that Echo and Rig is in Vegas and not in my own town. I love the idea of having a full butchery with an upscale steakhouse in one spot. They offer all cuts of meat and charcuterie and when I was onsite a few weeks ago, one of the butchers offered a guest to come in back and watch her filet a leg of beef. WHAT?!!?!? AWESOME! They have a full bar, (the bloody mary knocks my socks off!) and although we were not in for happy hour, the downstairs area can seat about 20-30 guests easily. The upstairs offers a full dining room , open kitchen and outdoor balcony with seating for guests. The bathrooms are big, roomy and always clean. I love that they offer a salt scrub for ladies to wash their hands after they grub done on some bone in meat! I have been here on two occasions, once for a dinner with a big family and once for brunch with another couple. Both times the food was outrageously good and the price point, well... on point.  Of course for dinner our table order steak, we went with the special of the night which was a huge cut of steak but family style for our table to share. We also had a multitude of appetizers (Bone Marrow! You're in a steakhouse! GET IT! And the french onion soup is EXACTLY what you think you should get when you see it on a steak menu) and the desserts were tasteful and elegant. But what is still sticking with me is the brunch items. I am a sucker for Corn Beef Hash with a poached egg. I absolutely hate ground up corn beef. Who makes a beautiful corn beef then grounds it up like dog food paste? YUK! And don't get me started with a \"poached egg\" that has a hard boiled middle. My dish executed by Rig was outstanding. OUT FREAKING STANDING! It was so tender, flavorful and so well done. I can taste it now. I want it now! HA!  So here are the down points, it can get busy and I have had service where I needed to grab some ones attention. The place was packed so Ill give them a slight break... my drink was never empty and that was a plus in a very slammed eatery. I also think that the upstairs when not dimly lite can be a bit sterile feeling like a cafeteria. For being in Tivoli they can add a bit of piazza and still keep it in line. OVERALL I heart this spot. I come off the strip when in town to grab a meal here and hold it in high regard.",

    "text": "May 31 2014. Called ahead. Said they couldn't take a reservation for 6 people. At 5:30 apparently there was no wait, but when we arrived at 6:30 it was 30 min, not bad on a Saturday. The host crew was friendly and professional. Upon being seated our waiter promptly introduced himself. Bread water, sparkling and still, were served complimentary. Our group experienced a bit of confusion with the menu; what appeared to be sides, the waiter referred to as appetizers and as tapas. The one knock, our waiter seemed to be pushing for the up-sale. He seemed annoyed that we didn't order from the bar and pushed hard for the larger steaks. Some of their steaks were absolutely massive. \"Sorry bud, we just ate a late lunch a couple hours ago and were out with the kids so no alcohol, nothing to get annoyed about.\" We were seated next to the kitchen, lots of energy. In our case it was entertainment, but if you want relaxing request a table away from the kitchen. Our waiter didn't make frequent stops at our table, think we saw him a total of four times including the check. If you are reading this review do decide of you want to go here, I wouldn't let my mediocre service experience stop you. I'm sure it was a fluke as the rest of the staff seemed overly helpful. However it did stop us from ordering dessert. And it may stop me from returning. The food was good, see the photos  for the evidence. Beware, the \"Bavette\" is a skirt steak. Good, if perhaps overpriced.",

    "text": "Ok, so we get there and they are super friendly. It was my spiritual fathers 73 birthday so we wanted to spoil him. The service was great. Atmosphere five star. He had a New York strip and loved it. However, I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say for all its effort to be something great, my food missed the mark. My ribeye was almost too rare. To be honest with you, the more expensive places from this place to Capital Grill etc, seem to have the most issues with cooking a steak correctly. I've gone to Tony Roma's and they have yet so mess it up. It  frustrates me no end that I can go to a less expensive restaurant and they nail it every single time but as soon as we go to shell out more money damned if they don't almost screw it up. It's medium rare. It's not rocket science. Get it right. Cook with confidence and timing for the love of good. I don't want rare or almost rare, I want medium rare. Most of the time I just settle and order medium these days. I am not confident they can't get it right pretty much everywhere but this time I took a shot. Now the cut of meat was not the best I believed it to be somewhat gristly  and I had to spit a lot of it out. I'm just saying the overall experience did not well me despite their best effort to please us the food just missed the mark I'll say it again. That's all and to the non foodies out there you probably have a great time. For those particular with more experience eating out,  I recommend you try somewhere else if a good steak is what you're looking for and not just a fun atmosphere with nice people.",

We had reservations that I ended up changing about 10 times throughout the course of the day (sorry guys) as everyone was getting prettied up and the party of people was increasing as well.  However, they were always very flexible and accommodating which was nice.  We finally made it there, 15 minutes late for our reservation.  Still, nice and accommodating!  We were seated after about a 5 minute wait and although it was late evening Saturday, and two of our party were stragglers, we didn't feel rushed.  The food was excellent!  My husband had steak and I stuck with the lamb.  The kids had what kids have, sandwiches but they seemed satisfied.  Our guests enjoyed lasagna and we loved the appetizers and the variety as well.  The manager personally comes out to introduce himself and our server was wonderful as well.  We appreciate feeling like celebrities when dining out for special occasions.  It makes the experience that much nicer.  Thank you!  P.S.  I say not good for kids because although there were sandwiches and items such as that on the menu, some kids are funny about bread types and such- therefore I would recommend for adults.",

But, considering it's only 5 minutes from my house it really should be in the rotation more often.  Anyway, went here recently to meet a friend for Friday afternoon drunch (drinks and lunch, so much better than calling it brunch), sat on the balcony patio enjoying the soft fall air and a view of downtown Vegas in the background, and it all came back to me.  The little skip of my heart when I take that first bite of the fried spinach salad, with it's lime vinaigrette dressing and crunchy veggies.  The perfection of the Portabello fries, how they aren't greasy or soggy, not even a bit, matched with the freshness and zip of the goddess dressing they're served with.  And then there's the butcher's sausage dish.  Smokey and seasoned to perfection, with a mushroom ragu that tasted like it was made to order and not sitting in a pot all day waiting to be served.  The service, as always, was amazing.  Our waitress was cheery, patient (my drunch date was 30 mintues late), and efficient.  Put this in your bookmarks list.  You won't be disappointed.",

I ordered the ribeye medium with red wine demi, and wow! Nothing has topped or even matched the quality of the steak here. The meat is a big portion, and cooked to perfection. Each bite is so tender and the red wine demi compliments the steak so well. The appetizers are also definitely worth mentioning. The baked brie, portobello fries, cauliflower, octopus, and thick cut bacon are among my top picks. They are shareable and are uniquely made in regards to seasonings and flavor.",

Walking up to the door and you're face to rump with a pig hanging in the window. Fantastic! My kids raised pigs so this was awesome to see. We had made reservations so didn't have a wait, although I feel as though we missed out on the atmosphere and goings on at the bar area. We were met by the maitre d once seated, who then introduced us to Nick, our waiter. After talking to Nick, he brought out THE TRAY, steaks with bones..including the Flintstone or as they call it a tomahawk. Impressive...but far too much meat. We all ventured on a Spencer (you'll know when you go) with different sauces. We also shared a cesar salad and the portobello fries. Again...fantastic! Our glasses never emptied, which was nice. For dessert Nick recommended the Salted Turtle sundae, which we shared and he also brought out a complimentary birthday sundae. We had a great time, and enjoyed our wait staff and appreciate the service they provided.  Also....my husband enjoyed the bath salts and was happy they had them in the wash room. Now I have to get some for him. Looking forward to our next visit to Echo & Rig, I want to try the burger or the BLT...so it will be in the near future. Enjoy!!!",

Sorbet ice cream was delightful and a huge serving.  Grapefruit flavor sorbet was our fav. Friendly and excellent service from everybody - from the hostess to GM Xavier, the lovely lady who walked us to our table, the gentleman who kept refilling our drinks, and Amanda our server was nothing short of perfect- lovely and cordial.  Highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "It's clear that this place is all about meat.  But they do have a unique take that separates them from traditional steak houses.  In my book, nothing beats the ribeye and that's why it can be expensive.  Echo offers entres that are just parts of the ribeye for a small pricetag.  They also have other non traditional cuts and preparations named after people no one knows.  The appetizers and sides are very creative and more interesting than tasty.  We had the legendary fries, but I wasn't too impressed.  I took a chance and went with a flatsteak with a french name rather than my favorite ribeye just to try something new.  It was a mistake.  The edges were completely burnt.  I wanted to send it back but the waiter rarely came by the table and the cut was so small it didn't seem worth the trouble.  The next morning I was not well.  I definitely had food poisoning but I really don't know for sure if it was from Echo & Rig.  We had a big group and shared most the appetizers and I was the only one sick.  And I know it can take over 24 hours for the symptoms to show after you eat the poisoned food.  I'm just mentioning it because it was the last meal I ate before the sickness and I had a lite lunch the meal before no breakfast.  So while I dig the atmosphere and creativeness.   I didn't dig the burnt steak or illness.",

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas for years and went here for the first time with some work associates for dinner.  Decor is good, but their is nothing to dampen sound (carpets , partitions, etc.) so it is extremely loud when it gets busy which it was.  Very difficult to carry on a conversation, felt like I was at a concert almost.    Waitstaff and Manager Beth were very attentive and very eager to please.  Forgot our server's name but he had this attitude like he certainly didn't want to be there which became evident throughout the night.  He showed us some large plate of meat cuts and I never understood what that was for as his explanation was very lacking and the large cuts of steak he showed us weren't on the menu.    We ordered and our food came out within a normal time frame.  Portobello Fries were amazing, Steak Tartare was ok, appearance was average but it was drenched in some kind of sauce.  Our main course arrived and everything looked good, however my friends \"medium well\" filet was definitely not even close to that.  Once it was cut into it was plain to see it was on the Rare side of Rare.  We found out that another member of the table had ordered the same thing and the serving staff had served the wrong food to both of them.  Beth offered another steak to replace it and after we had all finished eating her replacement steak arrived.  It was supposed to be \"Medium Well\" but they barely managed to get it to \"Medium Rare\".    We ordered some dessert and again the wait staff mixed up orders and served the wrong item to the wrong person. Nothing like paying to serve your own food.   We asked for separate checks and after an extraordinary amount of time our server ensured to point out multiple times that a gratuity was not included on the checks.  He seemed to be hovering over us as we signed our bills as he scooped them up almost immediately - can we get a little privacy or peace please?  Sheesh.  Overall - meh.  Waitstaff is attentive but unable to properly serve food.  For being a steakhouse, the kitchen can't seem to cook a steak properly.  Cost is far too much for the level of service received and quality/portion size of the food.   Definitely more than $$ place.   Cross this off the list places I will go again.  I don't mind paying for great service and great food, prefer it actually but there are plenty of other steakhouses in town worth paying this much for ok service and improperly cooked steaks (think Outback).",

The ice cream desserts were great. Really great!  The steaks were ok. Cooked properly and seasoned well, but the overall quality of meat wasn't as good as some of our other, nearby favorites like TBones. Not tender and \"melt in your mouth\" like they should be at an upscale steakhouse.   The service was good and attentive. A nice experience, just not a 5 star experience.",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined at Echo & Rig last night (6/2/2017). To sum it up, it was the worst restaurant experience either of us have ever experienced. For example:  - My fiance had made a reservation over a week prior to our 7pm reservation. We waited 35 minutes to be sat at our table.  - After being sat at our table, the manager (Kevin) approached us, apologized for the wait, and handed my fiance his card. He said that next time we dined there we should give him a call and we will be sat right away. Kind of a tacky move if you ask me, but this was the only apology we received that evening.  - We ordered oysters from the raw bar menu, and our server (Jess) later informed us that all were sold out other than one varietal. - Food runners removed appetizers from our table without asking if we were finished. We were still enjoying our food as they were removed to make room for additional plates. - My fiance's steak was over cooked. He asked for the rare side of medium rare and it was medium. - I ordered the \"over the rainbow\" salad and several ingredients in the salad were frozen. - We were celebrating a birthday and no complementary dessert was offered.  - A food runner dropped bread off at our table after our entrees were already cleared.  I requested on my check that 100% of my tip go to Jess. She was the only highlight of the evening, as she was friendly, professional, and attentive. Other than Jess' service, we had a terrible experience. I have worked in the service industry and I am sympathetic to minor mistakes, but everything that occurred had no excuse.  I sent a summation of my comments above to Kevin the same night. I have not received a response.",

Drunken Goat red wine-marinated goat cheese, brie, cranberry chutney, herbs de provence, green apple, petite greens, aioli & walnut bread  The Sweet potato fries are great. I don't know if they still have them as they don't seem to be on the menu anymore.  Great seating outside and in the summer have singers perform in the evening.  Upstairs can be a bit loud.  Haven't been in a while. Will probably go back when the weather is warm at night to sit out on the patio.",

Secondly and moody important is the staff from management to the waiters, hostesses, and bussers are top notch, each and everyone of them are professional, courteous, and truly care about this place.  And they should it is one of America's greatest gems like M'Tuccis in Albuquerque.  They put effort in everything they do and the food is stellar to say the least.  We were in Vegas for just shy of 72 hours and we ate there 3 times and my wife and I know good food.  My wife and I are trying to figure out how we can get here quarterly it was that good.  I want to thank Kevin for showing us an amazing experience and caring enough to thank us for each visit.  I would love to mention all the staff by name but in three visits it's hard to remember each name but we will never forget any of you especially Kevin and former Albuquerque resident Ari, you made our vacation one of the best ever because food is the way to our hearts.  Eternally grateful,  Mario and Stephanie  From Albuquerque!",

Sat on balcony for dinner, very pleasant service, delicious Bavette and rib cap, watermelon tomato salad, mashed potato, lamb cigars, cauliflower and tasty tasty sorbets.  Two glasses of wine.  $125 plus tip.  Would we return???  Absolutely.  Tomorrow if possible.  Wow.  What a difference time makes.  My 3rd or 4th visit.  Ate here tonight.  Really looking forward to the dinner.  Disappointed from the get go.  Waited 10-15 min to be seated.  Why?  Not sure.  Restaurant half empty mid week.  Then another 10 min waiting on server.  Then the meal....ordered a couple of steaks, sides, no dessert.  Steaks burned.  Too much char, masked flavor.  Then the sauces....chimmichuri and horseradish cream.  Both very underwhelming,  I like strong flavors and I really felt like the chef was afraid to offend anyone with tasty bold sauces.  Horseradish cream?  Little horseradish character.  Chimmichurri....not herbal, not garlicky, not wow.  Couple of glasses of grocery store wine...$200 including tip.  Not sure I'd return.  It's really a shame.  I really loved this place.",

    "text": "Before I go into this review, I just want to add I've been waiting to come here for a year so needless to say by the time I arrived my expectations were sky high. Were they met? A resounding YES.  Echo & Rig is a butcher/steakhouse set in the cool and gorgeous Tivoli Village across from the Suncoast casino. On the first level you'll find the butchers, a bar and the raw bar where you can get oysters while you wait. We didn't have a reservation but we were able to get a table inside. They ask for your full name which I thought was different but they do that because everyone from the manager to the guy who fills your water glass will refer to you as Mr, Ms or Mrs (your last name here). Nice touch.   For an app I had the Onion Soup Gratinee. The broth was absolutely fantastic and the small chunks of pumpkin were a nice touch. For the main, I had the 16oz Ribeye and for sides we got the roasted heirloom carrots, garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus & egg. The steak was perfectly cooked and the red oak it's cooked over added just a extra something. Incredible flavor. The sides were all amazing. I wasn't sure how the asparagus and egg would work but it did!   The service was absolutely impeccable. Our waiter, Jesse, knew everything about the menu including information about the Spencer's cut which was inspired by a small steakhouse in Nipomo, CA. The third person in our party was running late so my friend joked about giving him applause when he arrived. Jesse took it seriously and brought another server to clap for him upon his arrival. Little things!  In the end, Echo & Rig was totally worth the wait and will be a destination for me when I visit Vegas. The location is amazing, service is incredible and most importantly the food was delicious. Highly, highly recommended!",

This is a hidden gem of a steakhouse in the Las Vegas area.  They have many different types of meat from many different suppliers from around the country.  We arrived before our reservation and pulled up some stools at the bar downstairs.  Good drinks and good service.  The bartenders were friendly and nice.   While we were waiting for our table, we checked out the butcher shop and talked to one of the butchers for a bit.  He was really nice and gave us a few pointers on what his favorites were.  My Wife ordered the Lassgna and I ordered the Bavette steak.  The lasagna was a very large portion and she said it was very good.  She couldn't eat all of it.  My steak was a smaller cut but was cooked perfectly and was excellent.  Nicely marbled and very tender.  We split a side of the Mac & Cheese and it was delicious as well.  We also ordered the Mashed Potatoes which were very good. I accompanied my steak with the blue cheese sauce that was incredible.     Service at this restaurant is top notch and everyone is friendly.  Prices are very reasonable and the quality of food is as good as most high end steakhouses on the strip that are way more expensive.  I am looking forward to going to Echo & Rig again!    We learned about this place because we saw the owner, Sam Marvin, beat Bobby Flay a few years ago on Beat Bobby Flay.",

When seated water arrived quickly followed by the menu. Next the server, getting drink orders and answering any questions.  Now, the drinks arrived followed by the Service Manager Nicholas Gutierrez. He knew we were from Portland, he knew this was our first visit and that our daughter was a local......OK all the questions asked by the gal that seated us. Really nice touch. There are a ton of high end restaurant's that could use a lesson from you.  The great service continued the entire meal, by the way, it was excellent. Daughters steak and mine were done to perfection. We added the garlic whipped mash potatoes which also were really good. My wife had the Alaska salmon which she enjoyed and we had to laugh cause she told us \"oh my God this is good\" after every bite.  To finish, find yourself in Vegas and want a 1st class dinning experience... get away from the strip and head to Echo & Rig.  Thanks Nicholas,  it was a great night.",

Apparently they are very popular for their bottomless mimosas. We got the portabella fries to share and a steak off the dinner menu which came with hand cut fries. The portabella fries are amazing and actually made of portabella, not some fries with seasoning on top like I thought it would be. The breading is super light and the seasoning is on point. 10/10 would recommend Definitely the best portabella/mushroom fries I've ever had. Also came with a green garlic aoili sauce that was really nice and complemented the fries really well.   The steak was really nicely seared, maybe a little tendon-y and the cook was a little uneven but overall the flavor was very nice. I think it was about $35 for the steak and $10 for the fries. Would definitely recommend coming especially for the fries, probably should have a reservation if you come during a busy time.",

    "text": "Every cretin in Las Vegas has probably gushed to you about their favorite brunch spot - Echo & Rig. Who doesn't love being drunk at 11am on a Sunday with their best friends? E&R satisfies all the necessary criteria for a popular brunch locale: 1) location: it's inside Tivoli Village so your friends can pretend to be Summerlin moms and dads for the day. 2) Atmosphere: you can get away with dressing up or if you're still hungover from the night before you can wear your cargo shorts and Nickelback t-shirt. 3) Food: When you're finished obsessing over the fact that you're \"brunching\" and drinking OJ and champagne, you'll realize that you're actually in a decent restaurant. I haven't had a bad plate to date. I'm partial to their dinner menu with the scallops entree that rocked my world. I also like the mushroom fry thingies. My meat eater friends like their scrambled hash. Eggs were good.  Anyway, here's Wonderwall.",

    "text": "First visit was great but second visit with a party of 7 wasn't so great. Not sure if patio service is worse or server was too busy to give the same good service I received during the first visit. We were asked if patio seating was ok because it was a full house. Patio was pretty crowded and there were space heaters all around, we were also offered blankets if we needed.   I don't remember who our server was but no meat platter was brought out and it took forever to flag him down. When he finally came to take our orders I asked about the meat platter since we were planning to pick a meat from there. Eventually someone came to show us the different types of meat and I believe it was $2.49 an oz for any cut on the platter. We decided to go with 2 tomahawks and a few sides. Our server did tell us food would take a while since the tomahawk was a thicker cut, but it was accurate. I think he estimated about 45 minutes.   Bread was brought out with whipped butter. I wasn't too fond the whipped butter because it was like we weren't eating any butter! It was very airy.  For the 7 of us, we shared 7 different sauces which was disappointing because I thought it would have been 2 servings of each sauce since we did order 2 tomahawks. Some of the sauces ran out quicker than the others. The lemon chimichurri and red wine demo were our least favorite and the horseradish, charred onion and mushrooms were our favorites.   We ordered our tomahawks cooked medium but both came out medium rare. The centers were a bit too pink for my liking so I ate the ends. Even so, the tomahawk was really good. For 3 of us, the 33 oz was a little small so I'd recommend at least 40 oz between 3 people.   I highly recommend their cauliflower and portobello mushrooms. Calamari wasn't crispy enough for my liking so I'll pass on that and Brussels sprouts next time.   We did not see our server again until the end of our meal. He was friendly, but service wasn't on par with what I expected. I think they automatically put on 20% gratuity for groups of 6 or more.",

I ate the tenderloins and potatoes, which was good but definitely would try something else next time. My boyfriend got a filet and it was perfectly cooked.  Be cautious sitting on the patio! It was a nice day and the misters were on, depending on the breeze the mist would sprinkle directly over us. There was a solid 3 minutes I got rained on and the table, my food, my utensils, my hair were getting soaked! I laughed it off, but we had to ask them to turn the misters off and the manager came with a towel and wiped the table down and gave me new utensils.",

What sets this place apart is the quality of service was top notch. They really paid attention to our very request but didn't over do they're job. Sometimes it's overwhelming to have servers hover, which they did not.   The only issue I had was the fact that I made reservations a week in advance and when we got there we still had to wait over 40 minutes to be set down as other people seemed to be getting sat be for us. Rather upsetting seeing as these people just came in the door and were give tables ahead of us. Not sure why. What's the point of reservations if you have to wait so long? Overall the food was good, wine was also nice and the servers were attentive and sweet bit the front desk was a bit dismissive and aloof. Maybe you'll have better luck, but felt kind of unfair to us. Not the best look for them.",

I have tried the apps at dinner with my colleagues and it was spot on but brunch, that's where it is at.  A nice brunch selection with bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's on the weekends leads to a packed house.   Reservations are highly suggested but the bar also offers the full menu.  Like the meat?  They also have a butcher shop.  All in all 10/10 will try again.",

    "text": "I was very happy with my experience here and will be going back.  There is something I have found at so many restaurants - for all the cooks that know how to prepare steak or chicken well, many don't know how to bring out the best in vegetables.  So, I was very happy to find the best dishes I sampled here were from their small plates selection - cauliflower browned with chili and crispy shallots and the portobello fries.  Both were fantastic.   The wine list gets a gold star for some very reasonable prices both for bottles and by the glass. Our server was painfully new and slightly awkward, but his heart was in the right place, so any missteps were forgiven. A missed order was quickly corrected and comped, though I thought that was unnecessary, they were obviously aiming for good customer service, which is more than I have experienced at some of the other restaurants in that immediate area (that includes you Honey&Salt, ahem). For my main course, I had the rib eye cap at a truly reasonable $22.50.  It was served with garlic chips and a stuffed mushroom.  My steak was good and cooked exactly right.  It came with one complimentary sauce - I chose chimichurri.  I had mixed feelings about part of this: I tried both the chimichurri and the horseradish sauce and they were equally bland.  I also didn't really enjoy the chips or mushroom much, but considering that most steak places no longer give you anything with  your steak - any sides are usually $7 or more, I thought it was nice to have something with it. I finished off with a turtle sundae and left happy.  All that food for $50 per person (before tip) = happy diner.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, my boyfriend and I had been wanting to try it out for months, some were excited to give it a shot. We were seated quickly, but ignored after that for about 15 minutes, when the waitress finally came to take our drink orders, she blamed the hostesses for the wait, kind of annoying. My boyfriends ice tea came out pretty quickly, but my glass of wine took forever, so did the water for the table, so I was left without any thing to drink for quite a while. It also took forever for the server to come back and get our order, in fact, the server didn't come back, another person came and took our order, odd but, okay. They finally brought us some bread, which wasnt even warm and was nothing special, but it made no matter because the server took it away before we could finish it, weird! The appetizer of portobello fries was good, probably the best thing we ate, though the portion was quite small, and once again it was taken off the table before we could finish, kind of awkward. The arugula salad was next, and poorly dressed, with whole peppercorns lurking beneath, waiting to bust a tooth, hah. My boyfriend had the horseradish crusted butterfish with roasted veggies. The butterfish was not horseradish crusted nor did it really seem to be butterfish, it was cooked well, but had zero taste. The roasted veggies were still raw and unpleasant to eat. I had a filet, which came out so overcooked some portions of the crust were burned, also, the meat was flavorless. The garlic chips were flavorless, the  stuffed mushrooms garnish was also flavorless. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay, but seemed as though we were served the bottom of the barrel, because they were lumpy and cold. The squash with maple and rosemary was okay, but there were parts that were so overly roasted that they were hard and completely inedible. I was picking pieces out of my mouth. Yuck! We didn't bother with desert. All in all, the service was lack luster and inattentive and the food was bland, and overpriced. We left wishing we had eaten at honey salt.",

Our hostess checked us in as we waited for friends and we were seated right away when our party was full. One of our party had a bad experience before and the staff remembered him so our service was remarkable. I got the Pork Belly spicy slaw as an app that we shared at the table. I was impressed with the tangy, salty bite. I can say that you can not go wrong with the new pork belly trend going on the dining world. My main meal was The Spencer Steak, a form of ribeye cut that is not quite the size a a bone in but fortunately not as pricey but just as filling. From my past reviews you know how i can be about a steak i can do better at home. This I could not do better. Perfectly cooked melt in your mouth tender. You must try this as an alternative to a big ribeye. The staff brought us lamb cigars as an app on them. I like these with the Tzatziki dipping sauce a tangy bite to start your appetite going. We also had the salt and pepper fries which to me were not impressive. We did not eat many of those and in hindsight should not have ordered as we were getting pretty full. Wife has the filet tenderloin with garlic mashed & white cheddar. Steak was nicely cooked and the taters were on par with any upscale steakhouse. Over all our dinner was good and lived up to reviews I have read. The atmosphere is open and it rather loud. hard to have a good conversation. I will eat here again and will recommend you try it. Staff was on point and drinks filled on the regular.",

    "text": "I went to SW Steakhouse at the Wynn last night ( I will post a review shortly) and Echo & Rig was so much better, I felt I owed it to them to post a review.  First, it has been a long time since I have received service like we did at E&R. The hostess was very polite and friendly, but at the time I just assumed she was bubbly. Little did I know that the entire staff was going to be that way. Although it was packed, our waiter came over taking drink orders and introducing himself. Water and bread were there immediately. The manager came over, introduced himself, thanked us for coming, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. And the service didn't stop. Suffice it to say the waiter and bus people were as attentive as any, without bothering us--meaning they kept an eye on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and to get it if we did. For starters, we my wife had baked brie. It was delicious. I had crab cakes. They were good; my wife thought they were some of the best she's had. We also shared an order of Portobello fries--they were addicting. Definitely get them. My wife had the butterfish for her entree. She thought it was going to be like sea bass, very flaky and buttery, but thought it was much closer to halibut in taste and texture. She enjoyed it, thought it was prepared perfectly, but was expecting something else-not E&R's fault. I had rib-eye cap which was great and cooked perfectly. We also had broccolini--very tasty--and garlic mashed potatoes--just right. For dessert we had ice cream that was as good as any you will have anywhere.  Finally, the manager returned, thanked us again, gave us his card, and told us to call if we ever need anything. It really felt like an old style Vegas gourmet room where they treat everybody like a high roller. It was awesome.",

The atmosphere upstairs was lovely, and the staff was attentive and knowledgeable. There were incredible options on the menu for anyone (not being a red meat eater I was a little worried at first) and the pricing is excellent.  Being a GM myself I most appreciated the personal touch of the management staff with Chris at the helm. You could see them stopping in to tables all over the restaurant to check in with their guests (us included) and assisting their staff in everything from setting tables to clearing. I've struggled recently with the level of service around town, but my experience at Echo & Rig was flawless. We will definitely return, and have already begun telling all of our friends.",

The previous day I went to my local grocery store and asked if they could cut me some thin slices of sirloin so I could make cheese steaks. They lacked the equipment so I was out of luck. When I walked up to echo and rigs window the first thing I noticed where the pigs hanging from hooks and then there was rack of lamb and strings of sausages. I knew I had to walk in to check it out. Inside, it's a two story restaurant. Rustic looking but really cool none the less. I went to the butcher counter after looking at all the beautiful meats. I asked if they could shave sirloin for cheese steaks. They said absolutely and brought me out two choice cuts of steak to choose from.  I made my selection and it was shaved so beautifully thin. They packaged it and I paid. For those of you who dread cooking at thanksgiving they make thanksgiving dishes and turkeys if you like. Just FYI :) I'll definitely be back for more custom cuts!",

After a long week of a trade show in Sacremento we were dubius about staying in the restaurant due to noise. We were thrilled we stayed. First let me mention the human element. Hostess Lauren, server Michele and my feeble brain cannot remember dining room manager but they did all they could plus more. Watching team work in front of house was a ballet. I had interaction with at least 10 employees and each one had an answer, a smile and great attitude.   Now for food. Each course primo. Steaks rate in top 5 I have consumed in my life. We tried all 5 dipping sauces, watermelon salad, octopus and bone marrow. I cant remember a past dining experience that was so near perfect in ALL aspects! They should be very proud of what they are doing for the hospitality industry!!",

Most Steak places in Vegas are going to cost you $50 just for the steak no sides that's it. Here you get amazing shareable sides at a wonderful 0ric3! Beautiful location and setting with upstairs patio available to enjoy the Sunset. By yourself? No worries downstairs they have a bar where you can sit by yourself and order food whilst enjoying the Sports Game on TVs at the bar.

    "text": "Located in a fairly quiet Las Vegas suburb, Echo & Rig is just as good as any steakhouse on the Strip, minus the exorbitant prices. The ambiance is modern, open, relaxing, and somewhat minimalist. The balcony overlooks the Tivoli Village shopping center, making you almost forget that you're dining in the Nevada desert.  Being part-butcher shop, Echo & Rig offers several unconventional cuts of meat. You can order a ribeye cap (the best part) on its own for less than $30! Where else can you find that? Each steak comes with a choice of sauce, but we found these to be totally unnecessary. Our steaks were well-seasoned and cooked to a nice medium rare.  As far as side dishes go, the creamed kale was my favorite by far. Imagine creamed spinach with a more complex, springier taste. Very unique and delicious. On the other hand, the white cheddar garlic mashed potatoes were just OK.  Our server, Hugo, took very good care of us throughout the night. My girlfriend and I celebrated our double birthdays here, and they were very generous by offering each of us a complimentary dessert! Overall, we were blown away. Check this place out for sure!",

I just think if your price point is this high your food needs to be amazing and service perfect.  The service felt stiff and pretentious.  Our server was a bit too aggressive with selling and slow to serve.  We had to ask for a lot of items and he took forever.  He over-explained the meat and menu and it felt like buying a used car.  There was not one ounce of sincerity and the service felt awkward.  We seemed to wait quite a bit for everything and the food was completely average.  We ordered a bit of everything - rib eye, filet, pork chop, chicken and lasagna.  It was all okay nothing great.  Our server made a hard sell on the fried portobellos, they were yuck. Aioli dip was so Mayo based it was gross.  The Mac n cheese and gnocchi was good but I can get those anywhere.  My least favorite thing...dessert.  They only have sundaes.  Fancy overdone sundaes that were not good.  The shortbread sundae was disgusting.  Dry hard shortbread, hated the texture of the ice cream and there was a weird dried fruit on top that was not palatable.  Sour taste with beef jerky texture.  Our bill was $500 for 6 people and it was not worth it.  Honestly...at this price point we could gone to a really amazing steak house on the strip and that's probably what we will do next time we celebrate something.",

Day drinking has never been so choice!  Pick a meal, they've added a steakhouse twist to most of the dishes. Delicate hollandaise, bold smoked meats, perfectly poached eggs. Seems like it's hard to go wrong with this menu.   Reservations a must here in the heart of Summerlin, don't be afraid to wait a little longer to get a plush seat on the balcony overlooking the obelisk fountain and continuous parade of super cars at the valet.

    "text": "Oh Echo & Rig you have disappointing once again. I said I would never come back her again, but my husband wanted to try it out one more time. Once again this restaurant cannot cook a medium well steak. Its crazy. They must have a new cook. My first 3 visits to this restaurant were amazing and the last 2 have both been bad. Also, we were seated very fast but the service took 2 1/2 hours and you could tell no one knew what was going on. It was so unorganized. Unfortunately this will definitely be my last time eating here. Outback can cook a better steak for 1/3 of the price.",

    "text": "I don't like to give negative comments about anything but I just couldn't pass this one. It was a huge let down, shock is the right word to describe the filet mignon I ordered. I was with a big group for dinner on a Tuesday night. Four of us ordered the filet. I wanted my steak cooked medium and a friend ordered exactly the same thing.   The minute I saw my plate, the meat didn't look like a filet. It wasn't round but  shaped like a cone and I knew they served me the end of a tenderloin meat.  As I was cutting the \"filet\"  it was cooked medium well instead of medium as I wanted it,  charred pretty good on the outside that it had some bitter taste to it. My friend who ordered the same thing had the filet, it was round, plump the way it should be but they served it medium rare.  I had high expectations for this restaurant and my first as well. I love to cook and I buy the whole beef tenderloin cut them up into filets and  at the end of that is a cone shape left over meat that should never be served as filet.  When I grill my filet at home I made sure I tie a cooking string around it so it retains the round shape.  I was really shock that they served the end piece of a tenderloin and calls it a \"filet\" , charging my plate 38.00 and it wasn't even grilled medium, and probably weighed less than 4 ounces. My suggestion,  the sous chef should be keeping an eye  on the details from the meat, grill, temperature before it goes out!!! So disappointing!!! I wish I had the chance to take a photo of it, but no one took any shots of all the food we ordered so I skipped it. On a positive note, I would give the side dishes a 10 !!! Fried spinach salad, Mac n cheese, portobello fries, Calamari, cauliflower, beef tartare , mash potato, even the warm bread was good! The dips hit high marks for me!  The service was really, really good, the crew that waited on us were very attentive!!! This is a butcher shop, a steak house, where meat is the star of this joint and tonight the side dishes was truly the star!",

I knew they served Sunday brunch, yet didn't know they also served that delicious menu on Saturday.  Regardless, my main focus was on their mouth-watering burger, which I've have many times, as well as their salt & pepper fries.  As usual, the burger was cooked to perfection!  Even though they normally have great service, it seemed like they really stepped up their game. When I was half way done with my iced green tea, they quickly gave me another glass (I'm a heavy drinker). Nan was our server today and she rocked!  To say that I enjoyed my experience today was an understatement!",

    "text": "My friend had been raving about this place.  I enjoyed it so much so I Google about this place.  It was created by Sam Marvin. I didn't realize Bottega Louie in downtown LA is also one of his creation.  The cost of the steak is reasonable... Tomahawk steak was $106ish... it's the sides and appetizers that enhanced the experience.  You go to those steakhouses in the casino and the sides alone could be at least $20 each.... here there's options for $7/$8/$9!  Avocado toast, portobello mushrooms fries, mussels, French onion soup.... there's more! Gotta come back to try em' all!  Coke or lemonade, free refills for $2... no corkage fee for bottle wine (I'm not a wine drinker, just FYI for you... and in the plaza there's a place you to buy wine!) Give you an idea of how their good service doesn't mean fancy pricing.  Valet parking is free (when we went..Ask for an update when you go..)  You must plan to visit this place on your next Vegas trip... call ahead to make reservations.  They will return your voicemail. About 30 mins local drive from the strip... well worth it. (There is a verbal kids menu...ask them and free dessert for birthdays...)",

    "text": "I most recently went here for dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday. This is one of those restaurants that is just ok. An average restaurant. The food is not bad, but not too memorable either. I've been here a couple times before for brunch. The reason I go for brunch here is not because of the food, but because they have bottomless mimosas (for $16. Bottomless bloody mary for $22) and they're not stingy with the champagne :) Also, the place is nice and easily accessible, so it makes a good place to meet up with friends. I tried their short rib hash and steakhouse scramble for brunch. Both were ok. Not special enough for me to want to order again. I do really like their portobello fries!   For my friend's birthday dinner, I shared a 48 Oz. tomahawk steak with 3 other people. I think the steak was cooked a bit too charred on the outside, but the inside was a nice medium. However, the steak was bland and not tender. It was so bland that I had to eat it with a sauce. I recommend the brandied mushroom and the red wine demi (they offer 7 different sauces). The fact that I had to eat the steak with a sauce is quite sad. To me, a sign of a good steak is when you can eat it by itself and you can savor that juicy meaty taste alone, not covered by some sauces. For sides, I tried the cauliflower (this is good), brussels sprouts (just ok), and mashes potatoes (again, just ok). I also tried the steak tartare for appetizer. Nothing wrong with it, but I've had better. Service was kind of on the slow side that night.   Side notes: you can bring your own bottles of wine and they don't charge a corkage fee. If you have a big party, they automatically add a 20% tip.   Overall, this is a nice place away from the strip to have some drinks and appetizers (portobello fries!). If you're looking for a good steak though, there are other local places that offer better tasting steaks.",

However, the past two times we have made a reservation, my family and I waited 30 minutes before being seated. I checked in with the hostess 3 times and she told me that they did not have a table for 5 people after just taking a party of 5 that had just walked in. What is the point of taking a reservation if you are not seated on time? Reservations should be seated on time and should NOT be put in line behind a walk-in party. This was very disappointing and I will not be back for quite a while.",

It's nice to sit on the outdoor patio and they keep it pretty well ventilated so you're not feeling the scorching Vegas heat. The only thing I have to complain about is that the food is subpar. There wasn't anything extra special about it and its really something I could make at home. I had the short rib grilled cheese and the waiter raved about it but it was no different than any other grilled cheese and the short ribs lacked in flavor. The pancakes had too much lemon zest which some may like but it wasn't our thing.

First, I must say, I only gave this 5 stars because that's the most you can give. If I was able to give 10 stars out of 5, I would.  I found this restaurant from other reviews on Yelp. My friends and I were looking for a good steakhouse without spending an arm and a leg. They were hesitant at first due to the location (it's a good 20 min off the strip; $50 cab ride). I convinced them you could go to any steakhouse on the strip and of course it's going to be great, why not try somewhere different.   When you arrive you pull up to the most expensive cars you'll ever see in your life in person. The plaza this restaurant in is gorgeous. When you walk in you're greatest and welcomed by the hostess, who checked to see if our table was ready. To the right is the Butcher shop, which was closing. We then made our way upstairs to our table.   The restaurant was mostly empty; only two other tables had people. Our waitress, Ally I think, was AMAZING! Super attentive and quickly broke down the way they do things there. They recommend you go \"family style\" and order everything you'd like separately. They brought out a platter of steaks. There was a 64oz Tomahawk, then it progressed smaller. They recommend you order one and split it amongst your table. My friend and I ordered the 32oz off the platter and split it.   The food was beyond words. Everything was amazing, and the price was surprisingly not as bad as you'd expect for a place like this. If you're looking for a phenomenal steakhouse and awesome experience, GO HERE!!!",

Great for a date night, happy hour our my \"go to\" for dinner when we have friends or family visiting. The steaks are cooked perfectly and can be sliced and served family style. This allowed us to try a couple cuts and order another dish too. A little tip: you can take your own bottle of wine for a minimal corkage fee. We do this often and take a couple really nice ones to pair with the meal. If this is not for you, they do have a really decent wine selection also. The small plates are great to appetizers and sharing. We hope to continue to frequent this place often!",

    "text": "This place has been so hyped up that I had to try it for myself. I didn't think the restaurant look as nice as people made it seem. The meat market and the bar section are on the first floor of Echo & Rig, they have a warm inviting feeling that kinda says \"have a drink and buy some meats!\" The second floor is where the restaurant is at. I like that open kitchen that let's you see a little of what is going on, however, the decor of the restaurant itself lacks a relaxing atmosphere.   When you sit down, you get complimentary flat or sparkling water and bread & butter. Well....you're supposed to. The service here is what may stop me from coming back. The waiters have the biggest attitude ever and they don't serve you unless you stop them repeatedly and ask them to take your order or to bring your bread & butter. I don't expect fancy service, but at least let me order my food...  The food here is good, but that's all. I had the beef tartare, the wild mushroom soup, the fried spinach salad, and the grilled cheese with short ribs. They were all good dishes, but they were not out of this world amazing. I will say though, there menu does have a lot to order so there is always something for someone to eat.   Good food, annoying waiters, and nothing that really makes me want to eat at the restaurant again. The bar and meat market may be the only reason for me to stop by again. Giving this place a four star for the sake of the food.",

Repeatedly I was welcomed back by name including the hostess who took care of us without a reservation, the manager stopping by our table and our waiter, Dillan, shaking my hand and welcoming us back. We felt like rockstars... or at least the backup singers!  You can read countless reviews about the atmosphere and decor, the hospitable staff, the food being great and even the need to check out the hand-washing salts in the restrooms, so I won't go into all that since there isn't much more I can add that's new information. I agree, all these things were great.  E&R remains one of my favorite off-strip restaurants in LV.",

    "text": "I chose to surprise my girlfriend for her birthday.  We both watch the Food Network fairly often and have known about this place from Chef Sam beating Bobby Flay in a cook off. After visiting Trivoli Village a few times I knew that it would be a great place to come try for a special occasion. I had made a reservation the day before and arrived about 20 minutes early.  We were sat almost immediately.  Greeted by the gracious AGM Xavier and welcomed personally with an introduction of our server Sam.    We started our night off with a debriefing of the menu, as neither of us have tried half the cuts they offer on the butcher menu.  Sam brought out a few dinosaurs and explained we could share one of these monsters with a bone about as long as my arm sticking out the end.  We passed as the menu cut options seemed fitting for the portion we wanted.  We got both rib-eye cuts, the standard and the cap.  He offered to have it pre-cut as to make it easier to share.  We ordered the Portabello Fries (as it seemed everyone on yelp said it was a must try) and got the Brussels sprouts (my fav veggie) mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese as sides for our dinner.  Also ordered a cocktail to sip on while we wait for our dinner to be prepared.     First arrived the cocktail which was a gin w/ lychee, passion fruit and lime. We both loved it.  One drink each lasted us through our dinner.  Then came the surprise of the night. Xavier gave us two complementary appetizers, a watermelon and tomato salad, and a breaded spicy cauliflower dish.  First time I ever tried a yellow watermelon and was amazing! The fries with the dip are one of the best things either of us have ever tried! This alone would bring me back again.    Then came the dinner.  Three servers neatly placed each plate on our table and I think we then realized why we are here.  We had our steaks cooked medium, and I have never seen a more perfectly cooked steak in my life! I had some of the best bites of food I have ever tasted!  We both could not believe how good the steak tasted, and we did not even touch the sauce as we found it not necessary at all! We had some leftovers, and they prepared our to go bag before we got our desert which was fine because we were so full! They gave us a complementary desert for her b-day, and she got the Caramel Turtle Sunday which was amazing!   If you want to have a great food experience, and need somewhere to go on a special occasion, this is a great place to eat! I will recommend this place to all my friends and family and we already were talking about the next excuse to come back! Xavier gave us his card and said to give him a call if we ever were to come back so he could take care of us on our next visit.",

    "text": "Tonight was very disappointed. We come here pretty often considering a neighborhood steak to go place but recently service has gone worse & worse each time we visit. This place from hostess to server, busser, food runner have no smile whatsoever. Tonight the server name is Sam. The place was very loud as usual when he was taking our order, he stood across the table from me and said I can't hear you. We're 2 pax at 4top I'd think he should stand between us? Or do you expect me to yell at your face? I looked at him for like 2secs waiting for him to come through but no he just stood there.   Then I can see his not so happy face again when I ordered steak salad as my entree (I'm 7 months pregnant can't eat too much w small stomach) he didn't even ask how to cook the steak I had to remind him. The food runner dropped the food my mid cooked steak was too raw (I can't eat raw meat throughout the pregnancy) my hubbys ribeye was way too salty. he never asked us once if everything is ok so we couldn't address it. When we were ready for our check he finally showed up!   Hubby usually tip over 20% , tonight he still tip around 13% (I'd just tip $0) our bill was around $80. When we about to walk out He has the freaking nerve to stop us and asked us about the tips. Wow really? You know your service sucks.He asked if we would like to talk to the manager. We said no we are not here for a comp dinner. There's no need at this point.   Tips is based on your performance not mandatory. We were just very bumped tonight cuz we like this place a lot. probably won't be back anytime soon.",

However, it's not pricey if you want to just buy cocktails.   Second, the steaks are really affordable. The steak price point is only $30-50. If I order the steak on the menu then I usually always get the filet mignon. It comes with potato chips and stuffed Parmesan mushrooms. You can also order a variety of different sauces to eat with your steak. I usually just eat it plain because the flavor is so good.  Third, you can order specialty steaks. My husband and I usually order the Tomahawk steak and it's seriously the best steak ever. For sides we also love the portobello fries and the bacon for an appetizer.   Finally, this place has bottomless mimosas on both Saturday and Sunday for only $16! They also have a filet mignon steak scramble that's literally my favorite scramble in all of vegas. If you want a nice steak house and don't want to go to the strip then go to Echo and Rig- you won't be disappointed! The service is always superb!",

After meeting the host at our first dinner here in April, my husband  called that host 2 months ago  to make arrangements for this anniversary dinner. The host promised us a special table. We should've gambled and walked in off the street because from the 20-minute wait past our reservation time for a table (with a reservation!) to missing plates not once but twice (not OK when the hot food is set on the table but you have no plates to eat off of), to being seated in a corner with a view of the concrete next door and 90-degree temperatures in the restaurant (we figured they were baking potatoes back in our corner without using an oven), it was a mostly disappointing evening. The wine was superb, only because we brought it ourselves. With so many other dining options in Las Vegas, we won't be going back.",

The space is beautiful - modern, clean lines and sharp-looking staff. I appreciated that they were offering samples of the charcuterie in the bar area while we waited.   Service was quick, pleasant, informative, and accommodating. We got to see the special cuts of the day, which was a lot of fun. One recommendation I have to improve the experience a bit more would be to have visuals of the regular cuts as well - we had some steak novices at the table who would have benefitted, and it would enhance the experience.  Food was excellent. My steak was cooked perfectly, and we got a mix of sauces so I got to try 4 of them. My favorite was the wine sauce, which was not much on it's own, but once on the steak it really popped. The wine selection also highlighted the food. I had a Spanish Tempranillo that was lightly sweet, fully of cherry and some vanilla. My friend went with a California Merlot that was dark, bold, and spicy. Flavors of honey and an acid balance that worked well with the richness of the beef. I did not have the mushroom rockafeller because it had bread crumbs (I am allergic to wheat), but reports were they were also tasty.   We sampled small plates as well. The bacon was smoky and thickly-cut. It was balanced well with the tangy spice of the BBQ sauce. Cauliflower was well-spiced, and still managed to not overpower the nutty flavors. The salt and pepper fries were crisp on the outside without being over done, and the dipping sauce was light and flavorful. I also liked that the fries were not greasy at all.   Dessert was a major treat. I had the turtle sunday, and it was both a flavor and texture dream. I appreciated the smoky, salty, and nutty crunch that highlighted the sweetness of the caramel. Presentation on desserts was excellent.   This place is fantastic, and I highly recommend.",

Truly a wonderful experience and you can tell the staff has pride in their product and service. Can't wait to return. And we will be recommending this to everyone from now on. Probably one of my top two dining experiences in Las Vegas. Not touristy at all and definitely caters to a more local experience.",

But let me tell you what I dont love. Calling the manager the day after a meal and explaining that I dont like being made to feel cheap. Stop pushing so much damn food on me. I've been here before, I know your menu, I've TOLD you that. Stop telling me to order 2-3 of everything. I am NOT cheap, and these waiters/waitresses make you feel like that.  I got SO turned off the last time I came, I called and complained, was told I'd get a call back, didn't, and said I'm not returning. Well, my friend had a birthday and I was invited and thought, hey, it's been a while, things have changed....right? WRONG. Same pushy ass service. Like this night when I had to send my steak back. Put me on blast all you want for wanting my steak well done. Whatever. That's how I eat it. So when I say over and over, freakin well done, and you bring me some pink ass steak, I AM PISSED. I think it's going to be a long while before I return. As much as I love the food, AND I DO, the service is just so offputting, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.  THE END",

    "text": "This place is the ultimate spot for lunch or dinner, but their brunch is out of this world.   The brunch menu offers both savory and sweet options, from benedicts to blueberry pancakes. I started my order with a classic Bloody Mary (a Bloody Mary isn't on the menu but they will make one for you that is fresh and still has a great kick.) We also ordered the restaurants portobello fries served with a herb aioli ($9) as a starter. The fries are a signature item for the spot and they go through more portobello mushrooms than any other restaurant in Las Vegas. The breading was light and the mushrooms were sliced at a great size, plus I'm a sucker for any aioli.  In addition to being a restaurant Echo & Rig is also a butcher shop which made savory an easy decision for my main brunch plate. I decided on the short rib hash ($15) and I was so glad I did. The short rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and peppers were diced to the perfect consistency. Plus the hollandaise sauce had a dash of paprika on top which I was obsessed with. My friend got the same hash as me and my other friend got the grilled cheese ($12) which was ALSO stuffed with short rib and was equally unreal.    I capped off brunch with a final cocktail from their signature cocktail menu. I got the echo gimlet ($9) which was beyond refreshing, sweet and delicious! It was a vodka based cocktail with peach and mint, definitely one of the better cocktails I've had in my brunch explorations. They also offer bottomless bubbly ($16) if that's your thing, which it totally should be.  If it's a beautiful day (hello, Las Vegas) take advantage of their outdoor balcony seating offering lovely views of Tivoli Village.   Love this spot, a favorite for lunch and weekend brunch. I will absolutely be coming back for dinner soon.",

After reviewing the menu, I was glad it was simple and did not offer too many items. You get to choose side dishes, salads, pasta and steak. For the visit, we ordered a kale salad, roasted  pumpkin squash and carrots, a chopped steak salad and the butcher's sausage.   The pumpkin squash and carrots were amazing. Max said the steak salad was good and the sausage was the best sausage he has ever had in his life so if sausages are your thing then this item is a must try!   I didn't like the kale salad. There was too much cheese and dressing which made the greens all soggy.   I'm coming back here to try more side dishes!",

I got the Short Rib Hash made with diced Yukon gold potatoes, paprika hollandaise, bell peppers & two poached eggs. The diced potatoes had a nice texture, but the short rib was a little too dry for our liking.

    "text": "I never met a Rib-Eye I didn't like. Although I suspect the opposite may be True for the Rib-Eyes.  I have, however, had some rather unsavory characters come between me and my Rib-Eye and I don't like it (more on that later).  I have said this many time before, sometimes it takes a few visits before one can get a good feel for a place. Of course, the opposite is also True and those places typically get what they deserve.   When it cam to Echo & Rig, I was determined to take the time needed to formulate an honest and straightforward review. Which is why it has been several months and several visits before I sat down to write this.  The breakdown:  The happy-hour: is amazing. Plenty of people have already exalted it's greatness, so I feel I have nothing to add on the subject.  The butcher shop: is rather spendy, considering they will cook the darn thing for you for nearly the same price. Still, as Vegas is desperately lacking in good butcher shops, I am delighted to pay a few bucks more to save the trip to the other side of town. Plus the quality of meat is pretty good. Oh hell, it's worth it.  The bar: is a friendly enough place and the bartenders are usually very attentive. I like that you can order dinner there, sometimes a guy doesn't want to sit at a table all alone. I am very disappointed in the selection of tap beers. There are way too many of what I would consider very hoppy brews. Despite everything Mr. Koch from Sam Adams would like you to believe, the whole world is not mad about hops. How about a nice amber lager? And what's up with all the \"goofy\" beers, aren't those better suited for bottles?  The restaurant: is very open, which is not always my style, but the patio is always good place if there's room available. The decor is simple, but well lit, which is great because some of us like to see what we're eating.  The food: is excellent. Echo & Rig care about the quality of the meats and it shows. There have been a couple of occasions where the kitchen completely mucked up the beautiful relationship I share with my Rib-Eye (one-sided though it may be). If you're a steakhouse, getting steak prepared correctly is crucial. Do you really need me to explain to you Pittsburgh Blue?   The staff: is sometimes great and sometimes disappointing. I don't know if there is a pattern to figuring it out, but I hope they do soon. There is a lot of standing around and talking going on. I would think some of the other reviews on Yelp would have alerted the staff to the need for better attention to the customer.  The price point: is the real winner at this place. These steaks would cost you twice as much down on the strip, even the other steak house close by (Flem-something or other) charges one and half times the price for a lower quality cut.  I think this place can honestly make headway toward a 5 star rating, and in fact there have been occasions when it has, but there are still times when it falls short.   Until then, I will continue to make regular visits to Echo & Rig. Maybe they let me step back in the kitchen and teach them how to make it Pittsburgh Blue. :-)",

    "text": "My Parents found this place the last time they were in Vegas and they wanted to show it off to the family on this trip. We made reservations for our first night in Vegas. We got here a little early for our reservation and hung out downstairs for a little bit. I checked out the butcher shop they had downstairs and they had some nice looking pieces of meat. It's super smart for them to have a butcher shop right down stairs, lets you know that their meat is super fresh. When everyone arrived we went up to our table. We were seated in the back away from most of the customers, it was much appreciated that we got our own little private area. We brought a bottle of wine and the host that seated us joked that it was a $100 corkage fee, it gave some of my relatives a heart attack, but then she told us she was just kidding around and said they didn't have a corkage fee. I don't think I've ever been anywhere that didn't have a corkage fee so that was gracious of them. I really liked the style of this place, it was fancy, but a little rustic. The room balanced itself out, nothing too over the top, except for maybe that huge chandelier in the center of it all, but hey this is Vegas.   Our server, Ramone, was exceptionally helpful. He recommended that we all share their 42 ounce tomahawk because they slice it up and make it family style. I wanted to try the duck, but the rest of my family decided to share the steak so I went with it. We also ordered a few appetizers to start, they all sounded incredible. I picked the pork belly with slaw and the chile cauliflower. The rest of my family also ordered the carne asada bone marrow, grilled octopus and portobello fries. It didn't take too long for our appetizers, and they all came at the same time. We each got a small portion of every appetizer. The cauliflower wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, it was actually more on the sweet side. We asked Ramone what made the dish sweet, he told us there were pieces of garlic that were caramelized in brown sugar. Even though the dish wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still wonderful. Those caramelized pieces of garlic were and unexpected delight. The cauliflower was roasted and had a nice bite to it. My Mom loved the cauliflower dish, it was her favorite. The pork belly was marinated in a savory soy sauce and served on top of cabbage slaw. The pork melted in my mouth and the slaw gave the dish a refreshing crunch. The carne asada bone marrow was really innovative and unique. I've never seen another bone marrow dish like it. The addition of the citrusy carne asada and red onions gave the bone marrow more than just one note. It really freshened up a normally rich and heavy dish. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the sauce was tangy and clean. Lastly the portobello fries, the dish that I thought I would like the least actually turned out to be my favorite. I'm not a big mushroom fan and I especially don't like portobello mushrooms, but I could eat these all day. They had an excellent crispy coating that was seasoned well with freshly chopped basil and parmesan cheese. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it was thick, bright green and very addicting. I would come back just for that snack. Next came the salads, which I didn't order or try, but they all looked good.   I did use the bathroom a couple times here and it's lovely, clean and has a lot of space. I liked the single couch they had in the front of the restroom, it gave the room a charming touch. I also noticed they had a balcony with seats. They had a good view of the elegant round about and other shops and restaurants. Next time I want to sit out there.   Lastly our glorious steak came along with a couple of sides. The steak came with house made potato chips and stuffed mushroom. We also ordered the broccolini side. The steak was cooked medium rare, but it was more rare on the inside pieces. No one seemed to mind though because it was just melt in your mouth, meaty deliciousness. We also got some sauces with our steak. Everyone ordered separate sauces and we got them all free with our steak. The favorite was the red wine demi-glace. I soaked my steak in demi and got some thick and creamy horse radish sauce on the side. I also had a couple potato chips and a small serving of broccolini. The steak was unbeatable, it was obviously treated with love and care. The demi was like a gravy and the horseradish brought some zest. The chips were thin and shattered like glass in between your teeth. The broccolini had a nice bite. It was served with whole cloves of cooked, soft garlic and was seasoned with red pepper flakes which brought some spicy heat. I love broccolini and they did this vegetable right. Everything here was absolutely delicious.   Not only was this place amazingly delicious, but the prices were low. The steak that everyone shared was just $100 and each appetizer was under $10. This is definitely our new to go place in Vegas, such a special find.",

    "text": "Pink Himalayan salt, portobello mushroom fries with aioli, marble flooring...am I at Bottega Louie in L.A.? This place seem all too familiar thanks to Chef Sam Marvin who's behind both Bottega Louie and Echo & Rig. I'm so happy I could eat portobello fries whenever I please now.  Located in suite #120 in Tivoli Village. Across from Brio and Barton gym where there's a roundabout for valet. The only signage you'll find are carcass hanging and pig heads. This is afterall a butcher shop and a steakhouse. You can also buy Terra Blue chips, sauces from here aside from meats.  Our server, Brian was terrific. Great personality and knew the menu inside and out. He informed us that they currently have 3 dessert sundaes: applie pie, mixed berry shortcake and salted caramel. But that they would eventually have 12. He also told us that the 3 top-selling appetizers are octopus, portobello fries (of course!) and tomato watermelon and cucumber. Our busser, Shawn, also did a great job. Our tables were cleared immediately and our drinks were not even half empty and we'd already get another glass of whatever we're drinking.  For our appetizers, we got fried chicken, oyster sliders, portobello fries and grilled octopus. For steaks we had hanger (with Bearnaise), rib eye cap (with blue cheese) and filet mignon (with chimichurri) - all come with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. The sauces were excellent. We got a side of garlic mashed potatoes anyway. For dessert, we tried apple pie sundae and salted caramel sundae.  Fried Chicken: Crispy fried chicken skin (not breaded), meat was tender and juicy, and the sauce reminds me of Korean fried chicken...the one with sweet brown sauce. 5/5  Portobello Fries: Breaded and fried strips of portobello sprinkled with parmesan cheese and parsley. Comes with the most wonderful aioli for dipping. One of the reasons I go to Bottega Louie and now they're here. Love it love it love it! 5/5  Grilled Octopus: Tender grilled pieces of octopus with gigante beans in garlic and green olive vinaigrette. The vinaigrette gives acidity to the perfectly-charred octopus. 5/5  Filet Mignon: Simply seasoned grass-fed natural beef. This is my favorite cut since I'm not a fan of animal fat (except for pork belly and bacon) and as usual, cooked medium-rare. I got chimichurri to go with it but honestly, the steak doesn't need sauce. 5/5  Apple Pie Sundae: Vanilla ice cream, half a cookie, apple pie pieces and caramel. 5/5  Salted Caramel Sundae: Vanilla and coffee ice cream, candied peanuts, toffee bits and salted caramel. 4/5  The prices are totally reasonable. $35 for a good piece of steak? Oh, c'mon! For everything we ate, we only spent $160. We also got a complimentary bowl of cauliflower with chili. The only thing missing is macarons. Bottega Louie does have the best macarons in this country that isn't Laduree. So, when the day comes they start to carry macarons here, I've no reason to go back to L.A.!",

Top-notch service.  We stopped in for a late lunch/happy hour and were not disappointed. I had two small plates: brussel sprouts and thick cut bacon, dad had the BLT, and mom had the vegetarian sandwich (can't recall what the exact name was). SO GOOD. I also tried the Malbec (different than the one currently on the menu) and it was delicious.  The spot is a little fancy, but there were a mix of people dressed casually and nicer. Definitely want to try their bottomless mimosa brunch and dinner soon. Not to mention there are a lot of cute shops around this area too!",

Well lit, perfectly decorated with earth tones and the butcher shop was the focus point to the right. Ahead of you is the seafood station with fresh oysters ready to be eaten.   To the left, behind the host station, is the bar. They didn't have the best selection of scotch but definitely knew what's up in the whiskey and bourbon department. I asked for a Laphroig and they poured a perfect portion of this delicious scotch over the most clear and perfect block of ice I have ever seen. I could see my finger behind the ice, totally kept my ADHD entertained.   We were seated and immediately greeted by our server Alfius (hope I spelled that right.) Now, if you can't have an amazing experience with him, there is something wrong with YOU. He took our drink order, got a feel of what we were in the mood for and brought over the plank of different steaks for me to choose from. I picked my 41oz tomahawk and my girl got the sea bass. We ordered mashed potatoes, octopus and pork belly as well.   Everything. Was. Amazing. I was only able to knock out 38 of 41 ounces (with a 2 minute nap in the middle) but I was still proud.   I forgot to mention that almost immediately after being seated someone came over to fix the wobbly table. It wasn't a problem for us but the staff insisted they fix it.   The food was amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked and the sides were NOT made with pounds of butter and flavorings to mask the chefs shortcomings.   5 star service all day and they even recommended a desert for us which was a perfect way to cleanse and cap off the night.   My only issue is that I have to drive from LA once a month now to eat here. There is nothing better than Echo and Rig in Los Angeles. NOTHING. Mastro's, BOA, Fleming's and alike don't hold a candle to this place. Quote me, test me, thank me.   Oh, you're welcome.",

Tonight I went to echo & rig with my girlfriend we were early so we sat at the bar had a cocktail and a glass of wine bartender was great and made a very good cocktail we ordered some appetizers ..... Portobello fries, arugula salad, beet salad  and salmon .... Fries were great, salads were good and  salmon was ok .... We then decided to have dinner at the bar ordered some more portobello fries, Brussel sprouts and I ordered a Hangar Steak (medium).    The portobello fries came out along with the brussel sprouts and the Steak ..... The fries and the sprouts are great but once i cut into the steak its rare .... I show the bartender and ask for another steak he agrees and apologizes .... I am fine and say \"it happens\" ... Then they bring out the second steak and once again it is RARE TOO !!!!! At this point i pick up my plate and walk up to the kitchen and offer to teach them how to cook a steak because they obviously have no idea.    Now you may say what do I know about food well i was the chef of a $1000 a night luxury lodge, I owned two restaurants in Vegas one of which was a Steakhouse with Kerry Simon and Elizabeth Blau so I can at least say i understand a kitchen.  If you are a Steakhouse the one thing you should know how to do is cook a dam steak ....... It would be like a British Pub not knowing how to cook fish and chips .... I did tip the bar staff well as they did a good job and I feel sorry for them that the kitchen let them down.",

We arrived at 6:30 pm with a reservation and it took a full 45 minutes after we ordered to have our meals. We did, however, get our appetizers maybe 20 minutes into service at the same time we received the complementary bread.  The waiter brought over the giant platter of steaks before we ordered.  We were first timers, so apparently that's just what they do since they pride themselves on their in house-cut steaks.    We all ended up ordering a combo of entrees, salads, and apps (enough for each of us to have a $30 tab) Up to the point of ordering, service was on par!!! After we ordered, our waiter kind of took a turn. We think he was mad no one ordered a big $35-40 steak and out service reflected that. Our drinks were never empty thanks to the staff (not our waiter), but we never once had anyone ask how the food was (once it FINALLY arrived) and it took forever to get our checks... We finally left after 3 hours!!!   Conversation was good between us as we were all friends, but we had been hinting at wanting the check for over an hour and were never asked about dessert or drinks post meal... The 3 stars are mainly for the awesome busboys and drink refill guys who were NOT our server. Our sever honestly did jack after he took our order. Food was good but I'm not sure if the overall experience and 3 hours of time to get in and out was worth it... 3 stars.  Also..... Our server was so annoyed with our presence by the end of the night, he got visibly angry when we asked if we could get split checks. It's 6 people, not 20, and our orders weren't that hard!!!! He gave us HUGE attitude about it, so we just decided to split it 6 ways so we could get out of there (after 20 minutes waiting for our cards to come back) Can't imagine how long it would have been if we'd followed through with wanting our checks split. I've been a busy waitress before. Splitting a 6 person check is NOT a big deal. 2 minutes of time...",

It's failing at both and we're over it. Made reservations a week ago for 5 people. Even received a confirmation call the day of. Arrived 10 minutes early to an insanely crowded downstairs with blaring music, no where to sit, people drinking and families like us all standing around waiting. Was told they were running late, how late I ask? Here for a birthday. No idea how long the group of 3 giggling 20somthings working the hostess station say. So, I guess we wait...last time we were here the same thing happened so ok. However after 20 minutes, I go ask, how much longer? The group of girls working say no idea, there are \"many\" people ahead of us. So after 30 minutes and coming to the understanding that Echo and Rig is being run by amateurs who over book their their reservations list consistently, we departed. Twice in a row this is happened here for us, off to find a better run establishment in the area. Shouldn't be too difficult.",

We planned our wedding reception for the restaurant, and everything ran like a well oiled machine. I wanted an off-strip restaurant that would be \"where the locals would go for a nice dinner,\" and I was NOT disappointed.  I could not have chosen a better location for our reception.   The staff were friendly, gracious, and ever-accommodating, making menu recommendations, and working tirelessly to ensure that all 10 of us were satisfied (even the toddlers!) throughout the meal. I have to give a special shout out to our server, Brian. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and did a fantastic job with everything.   In terms of the review of the food, we started with the small plates - the knockout items were the portobello fries, the ricotta and figs, and cauliflower. Other really good ones were the squash and the macaroni and cheese.   For the mains, the Texas Brisket was one the best that I've ever had. I also loved that Brian took the time to explain to us the origin on the Spencer steak. Several people in our party ordered it, and it was fantastic. Just the right size, and cooked to perfection for everyone at the table (no small feat!). Even the vegetarians in our midst were satisfied; with all the small plate offerings that were vegetarian, in addition to the salads (the Over the Rainbow was great!), everyone was happy. The Salad was so big, that it was shared! As the person who paid for it, I also have to say, the pricing is extremely reasonable, with options at a variety of price ranges for everyone.   I'm sad to say that with our wedding cake, we did not get to indulge in the E&R specialty ice cream sundaes, but I'm hoping that next time (there WILL be a next time) we will be able to make sure that happens. We can't wait to recommend this spot to everyone, and come back again!  #echoandrig #echo&rig #parmieuxadventures #restaurantreviews",

We frequent the restaurant often and always wonder what's going on with all the meat displayed in huge refrigerators near the entrance of the restaurant.  The butcher (Aaron) was EXTREMELY helpful.  He suggested a nice mix of charcuterie based on our adventurousness as well as provided some great tips on how to cook the steak.  With our skirt steak, he suggested that the best way to get an even temperature is to flip the steak every minute (vs flipping it once).    He also suggested wines and cheeses that would go well with the charcuterie.  Even wrote it all down on butcher paper for us! He really knows his stuff!  Is it a little on the pricey side? Sure, but not more than Whole Foods.  You are getting premium service and products so you def get what you pay for here.",

Was told in an email that they had oysters Friday and Saturday night. Fasted server what type oysters they had and he responded with one type. Asked how much they were and was told  $3 each or $18 dozen.......... Ordered dozen prepped to pay $36. Waiter came back and said oysters \"didn't look good\". Found out later that they sold out Thursday night. So much for champagne and oysters. Food was solid as usual. Waiter, not so much.  We did get a dessert on the house due to anniversary. Will return, but wait staff needs training. Or something. Still upset over oysters.",

We stayed out at Summerlin for one night and decided to hang out the rest of the day so we could go back the next.  If they ever open in Henderson we'll be regulars but until then we will probably have to keep venturing over to the west side.  Food and service is top notch, and it's clearly not just any steak house. The chef varies the menu items to keep it interesting. Starting with the bread - obviously baked in a wood oven, steaks are cooked to perfection, so was the fish I had.  Very interesting and innovative sides they definitely take some chances here.  Then there is the no corkage fee thing. Oh my.... Can they make it much better? When we arrived with our wines they brought out a decanter, and a cooler. That kind of service usually only happens in Michelin star restaurants, and it is much appreciated.   At any rate- we walk out with a smile every time, thanks.",

The hospitality and service was impeccable and there was a meat presentation not the different cuts that they offer, (they have their own butcher on site)! There are reasonably priced bottles of wine and they even sell some by the 1/2 glass. I split the New York steak with a colleague and we probably got about 5 oz each which was plenty for me. We got the cauliflower, broccolini, and fries. The cauliflower was delicious but a little too sweet for me. The fries were fresh but also plain. The broccolini for me was perfect! Next time I just want a side of it for myself! The greens of the broccoli perfectly absorbed the seasoning from when it was roasted. This is a new team favorite for us! I hope you make it there to experience it for yourself! Cheers!",

From the ridiculous narcissist chef yelling at people in the kitchen to waiting 25 minutes for my cocktail from a person that is NEVER my actual server. I honestly can't wrap my head around it. I think Outback (the 1 time I go there per year) has more efficient service. And WTF is up other servers stopping by my table & moving things around?! DONT TOUCH MY STUFF! If I want my salt shaker close to me...DONT TOUCH IT!!!! So food...the menu has changed a bit. Of course they have removed some of their signature items. Buratta? Nope gone. The cauliflower was completely terrible! This is usually what I look forward to...the sweet, spicy crunch that compliments the texture of the cauliflower...ugh!  The pork belly was soft & mushy in texture. I sent it back and the server sent me bacon. Hmmm. Pretty sure I can make this mediocre dish easily at home. Yup. Yes I sure can. I didn't complain because I didn't want to be a total pita. But sooooo not pleased! And WTH is up with the wine list?! Can we say RAPE!? It's more expensive than the top steakhouses on the strip. Hey E&R....why don't you actually CHARGE a minimal price for corkage & let your guests enjoy your wine list at a normally inflated price?! Strange concept I know... My best gf tells me all the time...\"I'll never go back. Every time I've been there, there's been an issue.\" And the first few times I dined there I didn't really see it, but the last few times..I do.  They really need to get their shizzz together. From the kitchen to the service. It's gotten so terrible.  I don't think my husband & I will be back. I will certainly not recommend it & im sure they'll lose their actual \"diners\". Ya know..those of us that ADORE dining out & plan on spending money!  If you're on a budget...go here. If you want an actual dining experience & fantastic food & service....skip it.",

There is also a charcuterie  area, tables and chairs, a bar, it was quite nice.  The hostess took us upstairs where the dining area is.  It looked very classy and chic.  We were immediately greeted by our server and they have a pretty good memory on our complimentary selection of flat or sparkling water.  Our table shared/tasted the following: -Portobello fries: slices of thick Portobello were lightly battered and served with a green aioli.  Yum. -Bone Marrow:  A must try!  We all enjoyed this appetizer. -Octopus with gigante beans and green olives: very refreshing. -Lamb Chops: Seasoned to perfection and was very tender. -Trenne: Our server Nicholas recommended this but for us to keep in mind that it is not like the typical pasta.  I loved it!  I liked the crispiness and charred taste to some of the trenne.  The prime rib eye was super tender as well.  The black kale went so well with it.  We tasted Nelson's hangar steak and oh boy, that was seasoned very well and again, super tender.  E&R sure knows how to cook up a piece of meat.  We ended the meal with the berry shortcake and the caramel turtle sundae.  Caramel turtle sundae was the winner of the two.  Our entire dinner service was stellar.  Nicholas was super attentive.  Even after we had paid our bill, he still made sure that we are ok, and that our water is topped off.  We have already made plans in the future to return for brunch!",

    "text": "A beautiful oasis of perfectly cooked protein in the desert! Many thanks to Yelp for helping me to discover this gem. I arranged a group meal for my old college buddies during our recent trip to Las Vegas. I explained this to the woman I made the reservation with (who inquired if this was a special occasion). Upon arrival, we were greeted at our table by the manager who welcomed and thanked us for choosing his restaurant for our college reunion. I must say that this was a very nice personal gesture, and demonstrates an emphasis on a great customer experience. The space is a more modern take on the traditional steakhouse. I've been in many with the traditional dark wood decor and old time character. That's always nice and fun, but Echo & Rig is one of those foodie-centric establishments which understands that sometimes it's best not to have anything to distract one's attention from the meat (like too much decor). The space was clean, elegant, and minimalist. Perhaps it could be called a new take on an old-school steakhouse. I knew it would be outstanding the second I walked in. Just behind the entrance is a butcher counter with a refrigerated case filled with an incredible array of carnivorous pleasures in the form of cured meats and Charcuterie. I'd say that any steakhouse which is also a butcher shop is almost guaranteed to be great. The service was constant, attentive, and well orchestrated (this despite my rowdy compadres). We ordered a wide assortment of their small plates for openers. Each was better than the next. My personal favorites were the Asparagus & Fried Egg and the Bone Marrow Carne Asada. Please note that this is not totally la-la-carte. Each steak is served with a stuffed mushroom cap and their home made potato chips (all delicious). For my entree I chose their \"Spencer Steak.\" This was the center eye of a Rib Eye (I'm usually not a Rib Eye kind of guy, but this was absolute perfection in a steak)! There is of course an excellent wine list, and a great selection of mixed drinks to accompany a fine meal. Like me, all seven of my friends were completely thrilled with their meals. Another thrill was when the check arrived. Let's just say that we ate a lot of food. In my opinion, the $$ out of a possible $$$$ for the Yelp price review was right on the money (if you'll pardon the pun). One could easily spend twice as much at almost any other steakhouse in Las Vegas, and probably no be as satisfied as we were. Echo & Rig is located just a few miles away from the main strip. It was nice to get away from the craziness of Las Vegas Boulevard for a while, and was well worth the trip. The folks there go the extra mile for their guests, and the results show. If you're in Vegas, go and treat yourself!",

The manager came over to introduce our server who was AWESOME! He presented the specialty steaks and discussed the menu specials as well as made recommendations for dishes to share. They even have a kids menu (off the menu). Love that! Next, we ordered. My husband and I shared the 16 ounce rib eye. My kids ordered the Ultimate BLT and hot dog (kids menu). Others ordered the Porterhouse (36 oz. ). We ordered the heirloom carrots, sweet & spicy cauliflower, baked sweet potato, and ahi poke for sides. It seemed like no time passed and our food arrived. OMG! THE FOOD!!!!! The steaks were melt in your mouth delicious! Although a variety of sauces were brought for the steaks, nobody wanted to ruin the flavor of their steak with sauce. But, guess what, those were delicious as well. Then a birthday dessert was brought (carmel turtle sundae). You guessed it...delicious too. Bonus! Halfway through dinner one child fell asleep. The server brought a pillow and a blanket. I couldn't believe it!!! Best restaurant ever!",

It was very tender and  it tasted excellent. The charred onion sauce and garlic potato chips complimented the steak well. The ribs, however, was very tough. The waiting time is so long , 30 minutes for a seat and another hour for the actual meal. It is somewhat understandable considering it was a Friday night meal. Overall, beside the waiting time, the food was outstanding. I definitely will go back and recommend to others too.",

    "text": "Given the length of time that I've been wanting to try this spot, it's no surprise that I chose to have EVERYTHING on the menu.    Let's back up and start at the beginning. From the time you enter Echo & Rig, you know you are in for a unique experience.  There's the cute little bar tucked off to the left.  The white staircase which must have heaven at the top.  The cute group of hostesses in their all black attire.  And then there's the meat.  That's right.  A full butcher shop with big, beautiful hunks of meat pornographically on display.  Meat-centric heaven.   We went with friends on a Saturday night at 7 and arrived a little early, expecting a wait.  No need, a table was ready for us and when our friends arrived, we were quickly taken to the upper echelon where the real deal happens.  The overall vibe of the restaurant's upstairs is that of a very inviting, rich person's dining room (No travertine decking out my house!).  The lighting is low and warm, but not so low that you need a flashlight to read the menu.  I am also a fan of open kitchens and really like how it is set back enough that the noise from the kitchen doesn't take over the dining room.    Now for the stars of the evening.  We took the advice of Yelpers and ordered the Portobello fries although I was a little unsure.  Don't question it.  That crispy, fried goodness is delicious and unlike anything I've ever had.  We also started with:  Fried Spinach Salad - One of my favorites.  Just the right amount of oil and the crunch of the cauliflower is bomb Kale Salad Caesar Salad Fried Oyster Sliders (2 orders) (Didn't try because fried oysters are not for me) Small charcuterie plate - this was a last minute addition by my boyfriend who knows all too well that there's not really anything I like more than a beautiful plate of meat, cheese and accoutrements.  I have insanely high standards and Echo & Rig's plate exceeded them.  Fresh prosciutto and salami, two housemade pates, sour gherkins, whole grain mustard, some sliced turkey and toast points.  I literally had to force myself not to eat the whole thing, knowing a bomb diggity steak was in my future.     My friend and I both had the Spencer Steak which was recommended by our server and our other halves both had the New York Strip.  I really liked my steak, but be aware that the char on the outside of the steak may require you go a little more raw than you normally would.  My medium rare was a little too done but now I know to order rare.  It was still an incredible cut of meat and I really enjoyed it.  You get a steak sauce of your choice and I went with the horseradish cream.    As everyone has said, there's no corkage fee at Echo & Rig.  I hope they continue this practice, although I know it has to be difficult to make money doing so.  We brought a few bottles of wine for dinner and then ended the night with some espresso and coffees.  The manager visited our table and all around, the wait staff was just fantastic.  Finally, a dining denizen that I can love in the snooze fest that is Summerlin cuisine.  Echo & Rig, don't do me like Rosemary's.  Don't you ever go away.",

    "text": "Would you like the left or right side... of the cow?  Vegetarians stop reading.    Echo and Rig has fast found its niche in the Vegas steakhouse world.    1.  The producer, how they rear their cattle, and the breed, not USDA rating dictates what is served.  Corn fed beef with better muscle texture, Grass fed beef with more mineral overtones or at its highest level, Akaushi (Japanese brown wagyu) beautifully marbled wiith a sweet beef taste.    2.  Offer \"butchers\" cuts (flank, skirt, hanger, tri-tips).  The best beef flavor at the most reasonable prices.    3.  Offer sharable classics (T-bone, Porterhouse, NY Srip, Rib steak) cut to order.  Want to bring out the best in a steak?  Cut it like a roast.  Two, maybe three inches thick, 30, 40, 60 ounces, cooked right, the classic char on the outside, juicy and meaty through the middle.  In general, all steaks are well trimmed.  Evenly cooked to temp with a good sear (hard sear on the butchers cuts that shouldn't be cooked past mid rare).    The flank, skirt, and hanger; all American wagyu, are outstanding.  Beefy in all the right ways, the muscle has deep grain (think the way perfectly cooked brisket can be stretched), very juicy with clean, not cloying melting fat.  All are inexpensive at $26.20.  Note: each has a different seasoning.  Honestly the beef and it's texture was the star.  For Asauchi beef, two cuts stand out: the rib cap (ultra tender, gently sweet, well integrated fat; the best part of a prime rib, AKA spinalis dorsi) and the Bohemian steak (tail end of the sirloin, denser, with a sweet beefy taste and melting fat),   Note:  both cuts priced by the ounce.  Prices vary so ask your server.  Finally the big boys.  While there are arguably better places to enjoy a huge hunk of beef, nothing says steak like a 40oz, two inch porterhouse.  Raw, it looked between Choice and Prime but the flavor, exactly as expected.  Great American beef.  Aggressively seasoned, cooked rare.  Firmer with good chew.  The sections nearest the bone... oh yeah.  Two standout sides, portabella mushroom fries and glazed heirloom carrots.  There are other dishes.  Salads and whatever so you can convince the non beef lover to join you.  Well chosen wine list with low off Strip markup.  Very friendly local service.  A pantheon of beef in Vegas and perhaps it's best steakhouse for beef lovers off the Strip.",

After a few awkward moments though I did get a seat, and got an order in. The steak and eggs on the happy hour menu is quite a good deal, actually--I could have a meal out of two orders of that. I had two other things though--the bone marrow appetizer (enjoyable), and the grilled cheese (ok). I'd say the dishes were 4.5, 4, and 3.5. My initial server took my order and checked on me once, and then not again, another person (one of the workers from the bar) ended up being more attentive.  So, the lackluster service loses them a star. I think they were much more observant to people who looked ready to spend more money.",

He made a reservation for two on a Saturday night, we checked in with the hostess when we arrived and were seated within 5-10 mins.  We tried a few cocktails to start:  1] Sweet Passionate Love - Gin, lychee liquor, green chartreuse, fresh passionfruit and lime juice, with citrus soda. I love gin and this was a great combination of flavors and not too sweet. There was a decent amount of alcohol in there, tbh I was pretty buzzed by the time our entrees arrived.   2] A Rye Manhattan - Crown Royal Rye, Vermouth, and Tiki Bitters. This was a really strong drink IMO, but my BF seemed to like it.   For our entrees we both went with the Rib-Eye Cap - they advertise it as being \"the absolute best part of the rib eye.\" And I'll have to agree that the flavors were excellent, the meat was cooked to the perfect medium rare, and the presentation was just excellent. The meat was great on it's own, but we also got to try the Brandied Mushroom and Charred Onion sauces and both were delicious as well.   To top off the perfect night, I was surprised with a Caramel Turtle Sundae for dessert.   Overall the service was excellent, ambiance is very trendy and very Summerlin IMO. We had a great time.",

Roland was a great waiter and very attentive, he thoroughly explained the menu and they kept our glasses full with mimosas.  When I travel back to Las Vegas this is a MUST restaurant to return to!  George was his P.I.C, very great as well!",

I guess a reservation wouldn't be necessary but it was definitely nice to have since it was getting somewhat crowded. We had the pleasure of being waited by a very friendly gentlemen who we learned lived in San Jose (where we're from) for some time and he was really attentive and friendly.  As for the food, we ordered the infamous portobello fries, mac and cheese, carne asada bone marrow, and 2 steaks. You can probably skip the mac and cheese because although it was good, it isn't really different from other mac and cheese at other restaurants. The bone marrow and fries, on the other hand, were some of the best appetizers I've ever had. Also, they sous vide the steaks so it was very nicely cooked and tender.  The other thing I wanted to mentioned was that our main course took quite some time to come out and so they gave us free dessert haha. I mean, the dessert wasn't even valued at 10% of our bill, but hey, free stuff is free stuff.",

The bone marrow carne asada was sizzling, not only in temp but flavor. And the portobello fries and the herb aoili (I agree with Ari, could almost put that sauce on anything, including my shoes and it would taste great). Chose a large tomahawk cut. Definitely not disappointed. Tender, and you could have cut it with a spoon. Came out with sauces, a caramelized onion red wine reduction, cream of mushroom, a very creamy horseradish and a bleu cheese cream sauce (I dislike bleu cheese but this was quite good). I think I need a second stomach next time. Forgive my grammar this time around, two drinks in and I'm really not making too much effort.",

    "text": "I should be biased to be writing a review of a steakhouse since I'm not one to love steak. Anyways, this place alone deserves the greatest praise for customer service. Customer service is everything when it comes to dining in to a fancy restaurant. A group of us were here for dinner during our last weekend in Vegas as suggested by our friends who live here to try this place out as it raves awesome reviews.   From beginning to end, service was impressive. The waiter offered us water (with a complimentary choice of still or sparkling) all around and the way that they all presented themselves in pouring our drinks were quite the service. Our waters were constantly filled even when it was only half way. They even poured the rest of my cider when I drank just enough to fill up my cup again. The waiter who served us brought different cuts of meat and explained the different types of meats we could get. He offered recommendations as well to preferences we may have had. Very informative to any questions we had.   Everyone else on my table got steak but me of course. I got the Roasted Chicken Sandwich with a side of Portobello Fries & Herb Aioli. All our entrees came with potato chips as a side. As much as I love potato chips, these were too salty for me. The chicken was tasty, the sauces made the sandwich more flavorful. The portobello fries is a must! It was really good with the aoli sauce that complemented the perfectly battered crisp fries.  It was the highlight of my meal. It has a unique taste to it but its full of flavor.   But really, if you're a steak lover, this would be the place for you as it's well known for their steak cuts. They also came out with a complimentary dessert for our friend who was celebrating her birthday and so we all sang for her. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a nice place and atmosphere to celebrate something special.   Btw, use the sea salt scrub in the bathroom, it's makes your skin so soft! Fancy bathroom for a fancy restaurant. The view outside overlooked the big beautiful Christmas tree out in the courtyard. Go outside and take a picture as it makes for a great background during the holidays!",

From the moment I inquired about having a large lunch party to the moment we left the restaurant after our celebration, I felt in complete ease. Such a great experience! Sheryl was so accommodating even when the number in our party fluctuated a day or two before our reservation and her response rate was lightning quick. When our party arrived, we were seated in the balcony area and had a corner to ourselves - it really felt like the place was ours that afternoon. We were introduced to the wait staff by a manager automatically after getting everyone settled into his/her seat. They outlined the afternoon, what to expect, and got us excited about the food & service. E&R's waitstaff is professional and experienced. Expect an informative meat/cut explanation at the top of your service - super important. For our party, we ordered about 3 cuts to share within each table of 10 for brunch. Great way to have a taste of everything. Sides and salads are super important too for this meal so expect some really yummy pairings. The service was so good I didn't even realize that the kennebec fries that I ordered was missing. Such a great meal! I can't wait to make it out to Echo & Rig for dinner!",

All of those starters are amazing. I had their lamb chops, while disappointing that they didn't have mint jelly... he meat didn't need it and was amazing. Everyone else had rib cap and loved it. As always, this place never fails to deliver. Amazing. Ps ask for Xavier.",

The manager (Xavier) came over to say hi shortly after being seated and greeted us by name. We were at a little 2-top table kinda in a weird spot (you know, where they try to shove a table into a space that shouldn't have one just to be able to get more covers, sorry but its True) and he moved us to a 4-top in a better location. Our waiter was fantastic as well and the food was perfect. We'll definitely be back!  Our food: Cesar salad - split in half for us and was still pretty big. Very Tasty Rib-Eye cap - cooked perfectly! Brussels Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon - SO GOOD and pissed I can't replicate it! Kennebec Salt & Pepper Fries - 'cause one must always have fries! Apple Pie sundae for dessert - honestly was good but nothing I have to do again.",

Bar area (open seating) downstairs + main dining area upstairs. It's clean and everything is spaced right (tables aren't too close, nor too far). So snaps for lovely interior design!   Now the important stuff: the food.   I got the sea bass -- soft and moist, with a beautifully crunchy exterior. This was served with a side of olive oil for dipping; oh and of course a lemon slice to squeeze over the fish! Seriously, so flippin' delish.   Husband got their most popular steak (forgive me, I can't quite remember the name, but it's basically smack dab in the middle of the menu, so your eyes focus on it almost immediately anyway! -- great placement guys!). He made sounds I've never heard him make at a restaurant before. Yea. Ah. May. Zing. It came with a little stuffed mushroom, some housemade potato chips, and a mushroom gravy sauce (you can def taste the butter in it, yum!).   So let me tell you, this was so good that when our waitress took his plate (took it too soon on accident cause we were all talking and not paying attention), he shouted after her, \"no! Come back! I have one more bite!\" And she didn't hear him, so he ran after her and got his plate back -- then proceeded to make the last bite into two bites (ain't he adorable?). Now that's how you can tell it's a good steak.   Oh, and for you beer enthusiasts, if you can get their whiskey cask beer (not always on tap), it's a must!   Will definitely be returning :)",

After all, at most \"trendy\" restaurants, after some passage of time they fall back on the belief that whatever they do, the sheep will come.  Well, I WAS WRONG!!!  We were early for our reservation, but they seated us anyway, and the girls up front were so cheerful and upbeat.  The manager Xavier came over to introduce himself---we are not famous, I am an attorney and my husband is an airline captain--and this impressed my husband.  Our waiter Jessie though---STOLE THE SHOW!  Not only was he friendly, energetic and professional---he has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the menu and took the time to inquire if we had any time constraints (show to get to, etc.) before we began.  The drinks were strong but great!  The sea bass was heavenly (I could just eat the skin and be happy), and my husband who never \"cleans\" his plate, did here with the Ribeye.  But the best was at the end of the meal.  Computer issues prevented our check from being issued (along with everyone else in the place).  Yet Xavier took special care to take our information and ensure us he'd get back to us when it was sorted out.  Which is extraordinary when you think he had to do that with 30 tables!  We will be back.  We have a child to put through college and retirement to save for, so we won't be back every weekend....but we will be back!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I came in late in the evening without a reservation and was sat promptly on the outdoor patio which is exactly where I wanted to be. I had a lovely View and my servers name was Dylan, and he was incredible. I was greeted promptly by the manager on duty whom I can't remember his name right now but we chatted briefly about the weather and my water was filled and I looked over the menu. I am extremely allergic to butter milk and cheese all the good stuff and Dylan walked me through the menu thoroughly and helped me make a few choices that I was super pleased with. Usually I'm faced with compromising a good meal because of my diet restrictions but the server was so nice and explained each dish even though he was quite busy with other tables he took his time and helped me without being irritated which is usually the reaction I get. I ordered the watermelon salad which was incredible and actually has yellow watermelon. It's delicious whether you have an allergy or not. I also ordered the signature steak which on the side comes with a stuffed mushroom. Staring at my steak and the demi glaze I was allowed to eat, Dylan came over to me and I looked at him and we shared this thought of yeah I can't eat this. He told me that he told them to leave it off the plate but it was fine because he caught it in time before I ended up eating it. I never had a steak here and always wanted to try it since that's what they are known for. I will say it was not the best steak I've ever had but it definitely was one of the best services. I ended up sitting there for a good 20 minutes more enjoying the eclectic music playlist the cooler weather and a cup of decaf coffee. The environment is very friendly and relaxed and perfect for group outings or a date night or especially a night to  have dinner alone. I will definitely Return To Echo & rig and recommend it to friends and family coming in town who want and ala carte dining experience with Incredible food and incredible service.",

    "text": "With such high expectation and a group of hungry pigs, we were off to echo & rig as one of my employee whom is a big foodie critic said this was a must try place. We made our reservation in advance 48 hours before because we read that this place can get packed and reservation is a must. When we arrived on time the hostess made us wait. She said our table is getting cleaned up. So we waited and waited. 25 minutes later I went up and asked what's going on? She said it's coming soon you're up next! So we waited and waited... 35 minutes go by we are still sitting at the waiting area... Now I'm becoming a bit irritated. What's the point of making a reservation when we can't even be seated on time?   45 minutes goes by, a group of 8 people walks in and I assume they have a reservation, they waited about 5 minutes and got seated before us... Just to be clear we had a group of 7. I'm sorry but that was unacceptable. Clearly something is wrong. Either with management or the hostess was incapable of managing the reservation list. No updates were given to us. No water. Nothing... Just coldness all around.  We finally got seated after 55 minutes of waiting... Again, what's the point of making a reservation?   As for the food, honestly, if people think it's good or great, I can tell you from experience this place is nothing special. Yes they have different cuts but it's just a fancier version of BJs and Wood Ranch. The fish according to the server is flown in \"daily.\" Their sides are \"amazing\" and their beefs are \"spectacular.\" LOL. Thinking about this place just makes me want to laugh and cry. The way that people talk about this place makes it sound like JoEl Roubochon, but this is nothing compared to Joel. Their fish was certainly not flown daily and their their sides are decent but overly priced for what it is. The beef was good and priced quite well for what it is.  Oh yes the manager came out and apologized and gave us free dishes which consisted of 2 sides (cauliflower and squash), equivalent to a total $10 dollars. $10 for waiting almost an hour, LOL. I honestly felt cheated and abused. Oh yes they gave us their \"best\" waiter, whom was nice but a bit too headstrong and overly confident. Seems like he was in a rush. But it was a slap in the face. I felt like calling out the manager and speaking with him but what's the point? We are never coming back.  Overall, the wait killed it for us. We had a reservation and we waited for over 55 minutes. The worst was when a group of 8 got seated before us and they only waited 5 minutes. The food was mediocre. The bread is a joke. Serving cold bread? Hahahah. The service and he management was just piss poor and I seriously thought some of the reviews I have read made this place feel like the next Joel Robuchon but this was nothing close to a high end BJs or Yard House. There are so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas and this one was a big disappointment. If I'm going to fork out $60 per person (no tips includes) I rather do it on the strip when I know the service will be good and the quality will be better.   Save your money and go elsewhere. This was a joke of a restaurant who is trying too hard with their ambience and the whole meat bazaar.  1 star for the service (waited 55 minutes when we had a reservation. Got seated after a prty whom waited for 5 minutes and only got 2 sides for free, LOL) 2 stars for the food (cold bread and mediocre beef/sides) 2 stars for the value (just a high end version of BJs and Yard House)  Stay away from this place...",

    "text": "I love coming to Echo & Rig for several reasons.   1) It's so conveniently located by my office; it has become my second conference room.  (In case you don't know, it's located at Tivoli Village.) 2) Valet is right there! It takes me less than a minute to walk from the valet to the entrance of the restaurant, in three-inch heels!  3) No one ever says no to Echo & Rig whenever I suggest this place, and I usually deal with picky/snobby eaters.  4) Service is always phenomenal.  They always make it a point to ask whether you're a first-timer or not.  They like to welcome you back and warmly greet new guests and explain the culture of the restaurant (this place is chef-owned, by the way).  For me, that's a plus because it gives me a couple minutes to breathe and watch someone else entertain my clients for a few minutes.  5) The food is always exceptional.  My go-to is the duck because it is absolutely delicious, but the rib-eye cap is also heavenly.  If you do get the rib-eye cap, get it medium even though you like your steak medium rare like myself.  Due to the marbling of the cut, medium rare will make it too chewy.  I was a skeptic myself when the server suggested I have it cooked medium, and I made it a point to him that I will return it back to the kitchen if it's not good.  Needless to say, I didn't return it; it was perfection.  Yes, the portobello mushroom is their #1 seller, and yes, they are delicious.  Crab cakes are just ok even though it's 95% crab meat.  Caesars salad is well done if you really need a salad.  Their cauliflower is good and most people like it, but I like cauliflower without it being deep-fried, so I am biased.   6) Extensive wine list and all their drinks are amazing and well done; the drinks keep getting better as you keep ordering...    I'm there almost once a week, so maybe I'll see you there!",

Took a good friend here for her b-day, at the end of the night we both it was a great choice.  Lets start off wit apps. octopus, gigante beans salad and it was just the right amount of dressing and not to sour. next up portabello fries with herb aioli. kind of stuff dreams are made of.  Main course. she had the rib eye cap (med well). i had the steakhouse cut rib eye (med). both juicy, tasty and had the right char on ends.   For dessert we shared an espresso ice cream which wasnt nothing to write home about but it didnt exactly suck.  Overall, it was worth the price , this is definitely a dining experience one must try atleast once. and compared to the strip, what a value you get! my only gripe if had one was 2 days before i called saying i had reservations and was celebrating a birthday . they even took her name down and said we would surprise her and bring out a bday sundae. they never did , no biggie still had a great time, they must have been busy. i also should have reminded the girl at reception regarding the surprise",

Where else can you get a tasty piece of quality steak and an egg for $1.99? They also have an amazing hot dog that is only $1. They're plump and tasty too. Not like a bland mystery frank you get at a snack shack. The bar staff is always friendly and quick to offer a fresh drink. Their dinner menu is amazing and you will be shocked at by the huge gorgeous steaks they will present to you as an option. Also be sure to visit their restrooms (yes, I know this sounds weird..but it worth the walk up the stairs) They have the most amazing salt hand scrub in there. They even sell it downstairs due to its popularity.",

    "text": "Visiting a friend in Vegas with 3 of my other girl friends. She took us to Echo & Rig with a total party of 7 girls. Even though we were late to our reservation, they were flexible and we were able to sit out on the patio on a beautiful day for bottomless mimosa brunch. Jeff was a wonderful server who never let our water glasses or mimosas be unfilled. The food was amazing! I wish I had taken pictures. Ryan, another server, sent us the mushroom fries with delicious aioli. The avocado toast is to die for. And since we were celebrating a birthday, we received a complimentary salted caramel icecream for the birthday girl along with the apple pie dessert we ordered. Anthony was also an awesome server to talk to, helping us out when Jeff was busy with other tables. Overall, wonderful experience. Will definitely be coming back next time I am in Vegas!",

Around 9:00pm on a Saturday night, we decided we wanted a great steak dinner to celebrate over a decade of being together. He had never been and I was happy they were able to take us.  The service is on point! The hostess passed along to the manager and our server that we were celebrating a special occasion. Our server brought over the steak tray for us to choose from.  We were splitting the tomahawk and knew it was going to be about a 40 minute cook time. Our server advised us to order an appetizer. We had a huge steak on the way, so we went with the fried spinach salad. Sounds weird I know, but spinach will never be the same! It was amazing. The chili vinaigrette was delicious and really brought out the textures and flavors of the salad. I don't think I can have spinach any other way ever again.  The food was fantastic. The service was amazing and their attention to detail was superb. I'd definitely recommend this place for a special occasion.",

We didn't have anywhere to put our purses and the wait staff graciously provided a side chair to place them.  They do not charge a corking fee which allowed our party to enjoy several bottles of wine. The waiter made sure our wine was on ice and our glass was full!  The Drunken Goat sandwich was a perfect blend of brie, goat cheese, and cranberry on walnut bread.  Portobello fries....holy cow.  Served with herb aioli. Perfect crisp and seasoned with Parmesan cheese.  Hands down to the wait staff and management for making our evening run smoothly and making us feel welcome.",

The restaurant has a very interesting layout. Downstairs is the bar and very minimal seating mostly for waiting on a table which will more than likely be upstairs. The upstairs is also where the kitchen is which is laid out for the customer to watch the magic in the kitchen.  The staff are all well dressed in uniform and I've never had anyone who didn't know what they were talking about. Everyone has always gone above and beyond.  The food is INCREDIBLE. Not only is it the taste it's the price. I can't believe the prices on the food at this type of place.  If you're looking for a quick dinner or a dinner with reservations hit this place up.   Top recommend!",

The manager, Beth introduced herself to us and made recommendations since it was our first time here. Our server Hugo was very nice, and kept my mimosa glass topped off. I had the smoked salmon Benedict, my bff had the short rib hash. The salmon Benedict was great. And it didn't have a muffin at the bottom, it was a little hash brown. I prefer it that way since they usually end up dry and flavorless. The eggs were done perfectly. I tried the short rib hash and the meat was so tender. It melted in my mouth. After all that and many mimosas la later, we had dessert. My bff got the berry shortcake sundae. I had the cappachino sundae. Both were just perfect. Thank you for a great brunch experience.",

I was worried that maybe it would of been too fancy of a place to take our 3 year old for his birthday dinner, but he is usually pretty good as long as he is hungry lol. Our server took his time to make my 3 year old feel special for his birthday. This place definitely felt upscale without being pretentious. They even provided crayons and a cute little dinosaur cup with a lid and a straw for kids (hard to find little accommodations like this in a nice \"adult\" restaurant). Lots of small plates to choose from at 3 different price points. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. The manager took the time to introduce himself when we sat down for our meal and our server Dillon was great. Looking forward to eating here again and bringing my friends next time.",

Ok first suggestion,ask the customer if he likes a barely dead cow served to him before you do it. If this meat was any rarer I could have hung a bell on it and called it bessie. Next time ask. so basically that ruined my whole meal, F for that. my dad had the breakfast plate looked like anything you could get at a 7.99 joint. No jam served ,weird. couldn't find server to get any either,<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffrustrating.so&s=a8aff2588a1a206ee24dc68e58f2db38779dfc79c257db705430794c357a3ed7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">frustrating.so</a> i think the bill was somewhere in the area of 60 bucks and i was not pleased at all with what i was served. The waiter was working on his david copperfield act,he was very good at it too,he disappeared and never returned. I had to ask the very helpful hostess of all people to get what was needed. I may try again but probably with so many untried places I wont be back soon. Next up..Poppy den :)",

Their prices are very reasonable and I would have been fine paying much more for such a fine quality steak.   I'm already looking forward to visiting the next time I travel to vegas!

The opening statement says it all in a nut shell or in this case a Horseradish Butternut fish dinner (yum)!  We were promptly greeted by a hostess upon entering and seated within a reasonable wait.   Promptly greeted by one of the restaurant managers (Robert Wank) by name no less.  Classy touch and to me this is a sure sign of a well ran restaurant!  Robert gave us a rundown of our waiter and took care of our initial water. The chef did an excellent job in not only quick delivery of the food (yes they were busy) but also the quality was superb!  Richard stopped by to ensure our experience was good and even filled our water got more drinks and picked up plates!  All of the food was excellent in taste and presentation.   Well done Richard Wank and crew!  Anybody who is or inspiring to be in the restaurant business would do themselves a favor to pay Echo & Rigs a visit and learn from their operation!  Too many times I never even see the managers let alone have them interact and ensure each and every customer is well cared for!

    "text": "About a month ago, myself and 4 of my friends showed up at Echo&Rig on December 19th, just before Christmas. We came in, excited, and ready to enjoy. We sat at the table closest to the bar. We ate and drank as any group in their early 30s would. Shared apps, steaks, cocktails. Nothing out of the ordinary. A young woman waited on us, who I will not name. As our time at E&R came to an end, we asked for the check. The bill was placed on the table and was left for us to figure out. We did, over $360 in cash, was put in a pile on the table. We continued to finish our drinks and our plates of food. Moments later, the female server came over and set down another check. One of the guests in our party explained that we paid it already, as she looked for the money. The server insisted we had not paid. The group immediately asked for management. After a brief description of the situation to management, the manager spoke with our server. He then came over to us moments later and brought 3 of us out on the patio, adjacent to the bar. He explained that the server accused one of the members in our party of stealing and he pointed out who the server felt committed this crime. I want to preface the rest of this story by saying, everyone in this party has been friends for more then 10years, minimum. We enjoy holidays together, know one another's family intimately, and have even been in weddings together. I trust everyone from that party implicitly. That being said, we finally called out the accused guest to the patio. We explained the situation and he immediately took off his shoes, coat, shirt, belt, pulled out his pocket. He was one article away from being naked. Imagine the horror? In front of strangers, guests, and friends, being accused of stealing and having to defend yourself in that manner. Everyone else in the party followed suit and we asked the manager to please check the cameras. He explained he could not, only ownership had access to the cameras. Really? What sort of policy is this? Obnoxious. We politely obliged the managers request for a day to resolve the issue. He then asked us to pay the bill again. The audacity! We did, begrudgingly, as we knew the next day the group would be vindicated and the money returned. Wrong.        Over the next week and a half I called the restaurant almost daily. Everyday it was a different excuse as to why they haven't checked the cameras. Either \"The Owner's are working on it\" or \"They are close to a resolution\" or \"The manager you need isn't here\". This team of managers and owners passed the buck and I think it only peaks to their character as adults and people who run a business. Finally, after 15 days, I received an answer. The verdict? The camera was bad and they can't see the angle. It was tough to tell. I implored them to spare my feelings and please tell me if it was one of our diners who committed the crime, so that we could rectify it personally and I could apologize to Echo&Rig. The manager on the other end explained, \"It's not that....\" He would not elaborate. They basically said \"That's it\" No invite back in, no free dessert, no handshake, no sincere apology. They were just glad it was over. I will never set foot in that restaurant again and I suggest you do the same. We paid over $700 for one meal, do to the inept and dishonest nature of the staff, management, and ownership.      To conclude my review, I will say that, I work in the Food and Beverage sector myself. I work for a renowned chef on the Las Vegas Strip. The rest of the party, also works for either the same chef or others of similar ilk on the strip. We told this story to every person we could in the last few weeks, in order to gauge if our behavior and actions were appropriate. We feel we handled it in the most proper manner. E&R did not. I realize that reviews like this can cost people their jobs, so I do not take a review like this lightly at all. I realize the brevity of a tool such as Yelp. If you are an honest, hardworking, decent person, I believe their are better places to spend your money, right here in our community of Summerlin.",

    "text": "ECHO & RIG = ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN VEGAS!!!  My boyfriend and I happened to walk by this restaurant a few months ago and were intrigued by the fresh meat and butchering demonstrations in the window. We went in and met the butcher / chef. Aaron and he was very friendly and informative. He even gave us a personalized crock pot receipe and some fresh ingredients!  After that, we knew we had to go back and try the dining experience. We went back this weekend and there was a 40 minute wait, but it flew by. We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar downstairs and chatted with the Aaron again while he was breaking down some meat for the evening.   Now for the food - - AMAZING! First we started with the sausage and peppers and the portabella fries. Now, I don't like mushrooms but the waitress said we had to try them so we did and they were great! The breadding was light and crunchy and not at all greasy and the dipping sauce complimented them superbly. For entrees my boyfriend had the new coulotte steak and I had the roasted chicken sandwich (I know, I know a sandwich at a steak place? But the balsamic onions had me at Hello). For sides we had the cauliflower and fries. The steak was scrumptous, perfect crust with just the right amount of seasoning to let the natural flavor of the meat shine. The cauliflower was unlike any vegetable I have ever had. It was sweet and spicy and all the different flavors popped in my mouth with each bite. A MUST TRY! The sandwich was great too - the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the onions, arugula and onions merried perfectly with the chicken.   We brought in our own wine to take advantage of free corkage so the total bill was only $60!! We couldn't belive it. For food that held its own against some of the steak greats like Mastros, Flemmings and Mortons the value was unlike any other. One of the best restaurant experiences in Vegas!",

The service was also impeccable. Echo & Rig has an exceptional waitstaff and has managers making sure that customers are satisfied. My daughter had ordered a seafood with black pasta dish. She was eating the dish but did not appear to be enjoying it and our waiter noticed. He immediately came over and offered to get her another selection without being prompted to do so. He also made sure the item was removed from the bill. That is the type of exceptional service that separates Echo & Rig from other restaurants.  These guys \"get it\" with a reasonably priced menu and great food and service",

I was told the salad was big enough for two people, so that's all I ordered. Being in food and beverage I could just tell my table was being judged for not ordering wine or steak or more expensive items. Other tables around us got excellent service but we hardly got checked on. We were dismissed by the server and the manager, the manger who introduced himself and said he would be overlooking our table, not once did he ask how our food was, neither did the server. The only person who was on it was the guy who filled out water the entire time. I was looking forward to bringing my husband here and trying the ribeye, and other things on the menu, but service was horrible that I don't want to give them a second chance let alone my business, I'm so super bummed that service was the way it was.

They had to seat us at 2 separate tables.  We were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and it was a good 15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  Our server kept coming by our table and saying \"take your time-no hurry\", well we were ready the first time.  Drinks took about 10 minutes once we ordered them and then we had to make the effort to ask for additional drinks that arrived just as slow as the first.  It was about 25 minutes till we received bread and they took our order.  Needless to say we had 8 people at our table and they only brought enough bread for each person to have one VERY SMALL piece and only one VERY SMALL thing of butter.  It took 30 minutes to get our appetizers and we had to request 4 additional bread refills because we were all sitting there starving...plus EACH time I had to ask for additional butter.  25 minutes after our appetizers the main dishes arrived.  My husband's porterhouse was over cooked and had way to much sinew.  I only got a grilled cheese so really no need to comment on that.  However, most meals came with a side of \"garlic chips\"...these were homemade, deep fried slices of potatoes with absolutely no taste.  Complete blah with no hint of garlic or any seasoning.  The mushroom served with all meals was plain and stuffed with very dried bread crumbs...  They must have felt bad for making us wait so long for our dinner because they threw in a complimentary deep fried spinach salad...Way to much oil on that!  Ooops, almost forgot--I ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts which they never brought so I had to request they remove that from my bill.  Over all this dinner dragged on and on and was not relaxing nor enjoyable.  Only great or memorable thing was my husband's drink- Kentucky Peachtree, VERY good!",

I thought I had ordered a $35 NY but instead got a $60 NY with bone in even though I pointed to the menu item and was fairly certain the waiter understood... I'd like to think this was just a miscommunication, but when the food was brought out it was painfully obvious that the steak was close to beef Jerky so the waited apologized and offered to comp it. I did not want to delay the remainder of our party so I kept it. At the end of dinner the waiter asked how it was and I told him very disappointing. With that he comped a dessert and said sorry... Not the comp I was expecting.  Given the vast competition of steak houses in Vegas I would recommend skipping this one. Hope this is a helpful post for anyone that is about to spend a couple hundred dollars to be completely satisfied with a phenomenal Vegas quantity meal!",

My second drink (I asked for a twist) came without it even though the first drink had one. Go figure. The worst part was that they had to run my bill three times before they got it right, that was really strange.

The server was impeccable, explained the entire menu made sure we didn't have any questions. The food was amazing. after we are finished with our appetizers and dinner they brought a complimentary caramel and sea salt sundae for my husband's birthday. I would say it's reasonably price for the quality and service and we will be going there again.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with my family and friends.  The place was packed on a Thursday night.  The dining room is sleek and modern, but it is very loud because there is no carpeting in the restaurant.  We had a hard time hearing each other across a medium-sized round table.  We ordered a rainbow salad, sauteed spinach, apple and fennel salad, pork belly, bone-in New York Strip (you  pay extra for this), grilled cheese sandwich (has shortrib in it), and a hamburger.  All the small plates were ok - nothing to write home about.  The pork belly was very sweet for our taste.  The hamburger came out cold and was sent back.  The second time it came out, it was overcooked and cold.  The third time it came out, it was good.  That said, our friend did not get the burger until we all had finished our meals.  The waither, however, did bring our friend a cup of mushroom soup to tide him over until the burger was ready. The steak was good, but I felt the meat was oversalted.  The sauces and mushrooms that came with the steak were good.  My brother enjoyed the grilled cheese.  To compensate for the burger problem, that meal was comped, and we got two free desserts - a turtle ice cream sundae and a berry sundae.  Both were quite good.   Service here is very attentive and friendly.  I think they might have had an off night when we were there.  Overall, I would come back and would try a different dish next time.",

    "text": "LOVE this place. Newest pick for a dinner place that is nice & trendy but not packed or overpriced like the tourist spots tend to be.  The space itself is beautiful, with high ceilings, modern decor and the butcher feel that's just plain cool (sorry, I know I sound lame, but it's the best word to describe it). I love the hot dog and cheese area you can order from while you wait, as well as being able to stare at all the awesome cuts of meat before heading upstairs. The bar also looked great and very cozy, but I didn't sit down since the wait was only a few minutes.  Onto the food - I ordered the steak sandwich ($12) and my grandparents the burger ($12) and skirt steak ($22). Everything was delicious, and the sides we got (mac & cheese and brussel sprouts, $7 each) were divine. Great wine and beer and cocktail selection. Wish we weren't so stuffed from the meal and had room for dessert!  The service was great, if not a little new. Some waiters were unaware of the menu and order of food delivery, and my grandfather's burger came without cheese and undercooked at first, but really it was quite enjoyable overall.  I was shocked at how affordable this place was. Even if you ordered a ton of food you could have a fantastic dinner for well under $50 each. The steaks, the sides, the drinks...everything. Really a fantastic new spot. Can't wait to return soon!",

We shared the Hawaiian cut which was so flavorful I could have slurped up the juice off the plate! Caesar salad and Asparagus with egg -best we've had! Bonus points - I couldn't decide on which dessert and our waiter offered to make the choice for us and brought our the strawberry shortcake - it was the perfect balance of sweetness with the fruit, shortcake for texture and fresh whipped cream.   Overall -- impeccable service, chic decor (love the mix & match seating), and tasty food. Excited to see they serve lunch and brunch so we look forward to our next meal at E&R!

Sea bass wasn't bad but not as light as I typically like. Very good Carmel turtle desert w salted caramel ice cream. The berry shortcake was very good also. Would come just to get dessert.

The slab bacon is excellent, the burger patties are amazing, and the sausages and terrines are lovely.  They're the only butcher I have put special requests in to that actually produced, and since they bring in whole animals, I can always get pork skin on, which is very rare these days outside of a Chinese market (which don't generally have roasts).  Oh, and give their experiments a try, never been disappointed.  Service at the bar is friendly and competent.  The beer selection is respectable for the small number of taps and the house wines are decent.  The happy hour menu is great, sadly they've reduced the happy hour hours.  From the full menu the bone marrow carne asada is excellent, and they do not treat their calamari as an afterthought.  The Mac and cheese is not the best in town but it is not disappointing.    The one real problem is the weekend.  Since they do brunch the regular menu is not available before 4pm, which is kind of a bummer if you go to the farmer's market, which ends at 2pm, and want to grab a proper bite there afterwards.  I don't know about anyone else but I like to have breakfast before wandering a farmer's market, not after.",

We sat out on the balcony, nice view of downtown Vegas, though not panoramic due to some buildings. The wait staff were superb, taking care of you as a TEAM, each able to answer your questions equally informative.  The food was excellent.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I only take the time to review a restaurant if it's worth reviewing.  That being said, Echo & Rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Their downfall is 80% of the staff and service!   I started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! Since January I have been back AT LEAST 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  I return because the food is THAT GOOD (that is, IF I receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right).  First time I went, it was during lunch.  The server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  Lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.  Returned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  There are two evening hostesses that ALWAYS remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  However the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  Only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  Offered the cuts of the house only once since I've been there.  Once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  Found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  One waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  Waiters seem rushed or impatient.  Management seems unconcerned.  Complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.  Went for lunch once and, I kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  Ordered the Portabello Fries (YUM by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while I ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  Also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  At the end of the meal (fries STILL up in the warmer) I was presented with a check that still had the fries and coke.  Mind you there were only 4 other tables present.   Also have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  Also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.    Positive notes: food is amazing.  Flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  Portabello fries are always a favorite, Carne Asada bone marrow delish.  Love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  Black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  Crispy bacon is decadent.  Ultimate BLT was one of the first things I tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  Decent wine selection, white sangria is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  They used to have a chaucuterie board that was really good but I no longer see on their menu.  Downstairs has fresh squeezed juices that they should put at least on their lunch menu, I am always curious about them but never know what they have.  Steaks are amazing, I have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  All their meats or all natural grass fed.  Have been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  This restaurant definitely deserves better.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE... you get a sense of classy yet HIP. Every time i go there i feel like its the place to be.  Service is EXCELLENT... wife says it was a lil too much but i rather have too much then dying of thirst bc im waiting forever for water. OH the food...hahaha... This is steak place and they do have a GOOD selection. Their presentation is ON POINT!  They have the hippest butcher shop on the first floor and when you are seated (on the second floor) they present this HUGE platter of various cuts of beef.  CARNIVORE HEAVEN!!  They have a variety on the menu from small menu items to regular options. The wife and i always order several small plates and 1 main steak dish and we feel STUFFED.  Not gonna talk bout the menu bc its a place you need to experience yourself and people put up many pictures here that you dont need me to talk bout it.  Im sure all the staff is great although Austin (server) and Kevin (manager) took care of us this night. After eating take a walk around the mall if its not too hot. As i always say.... try this place... you might like it !!!",

    "text": "Last night we had such a fantastic experience eating dinner at Echo & Rig! We are locals that live in Summerlin. We brought four friends from the LA area who had never been there.  From entering the front door, where we were greeted by five smiling beautiful hostesses, to the end of a spectacular dining experience, the evening could not have been any more enjoyable!  The attention we were given from Derek, the general manager and Austin, our food engineer(waiter) was spectacular!  The quality and presentation of our dinners was the BEST! We all had steaks, from their Special selection, Rib Eye and New York cuts. We all agreed that they were the BEST we have ever had. Our evening ended by  celebrating my birthday with two delicious desserts!  So, if you are looked big for the best steak house in Las Vegas, Echo & Rig is it! Brenda & Ted",

    "text": "The service at E&R was beyond excellent.  Our server, the manager, and other staff members were laser-focused on their roles from seating us through thanking us at the end of the evening.  We specifically selected this restaurant because of the no-corkage fee.   Our waitress was the best of the best I've experienced.  Having been a waiter myself, those extra touches of refilling water glasses without being asked, discrete plate removal, pouring of wine, as well as really knowing the menu all made for an excellent experience.  I would rank the service higher than the best restaurants I've dined at in New York, Chicago, Paris, or London.   The downside - the ribeye cap was tough.  The tendon structure of the meat made it tough to cut and it was cooked at a True medium rare rather than the medium I ordered.  The flavor was superb as well as each \"little plate\" of side dishes.   In summary, a 7 on service and a 3.5 on the ribeye.   This should demonstrate just how important training and execution of service is to any restaurant, whether an IHOP or Michelin-rated establishment.  Service trumps Selection and can balance a dining experience that may be less than perfect.",
