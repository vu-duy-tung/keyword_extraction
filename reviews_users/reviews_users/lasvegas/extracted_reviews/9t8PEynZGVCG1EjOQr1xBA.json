The name is a little deceiving because who thinks Chicago style tacos would be good tacos lol I'm from LA, I know good tacos. Worst part of the experience was not personally ordering enough tacos!! They were so good!! I could have had a dozen to myself and can't wait to go back and get more! I'm mad I live so far cause this place would be a daily stop for me! The tacos were bomb, the asada fries were damn good and you can't beat the prices. I'm so tired of being charged thru the roof for tacos that suck. Here you get great tasting food for cheap! I'll definitely be coming back when ever I'm on that side of town! Worth the trip! Give them a shot!!",

    "text": "What a gem, place is hard to find yet right in front of your face lol! The lady and I decided to check out a new spot, this fit the bill perfectly. Hot new business, perfect ratings, and close to home. When we arrived it was clean, staff was friendly, and the menu is easy to navigate. Prices are comparable to other similar resrurants. We ordered asada, barbacoa, and pastor tacos along with pastor windy city fries, champorrado, and an horchata. I will say that the meats are outstanding, seasoned very well and cooked perfectly. My favorite was the barbacoa, I usually tend to like the pastor because it has pineapple which adds a tartness and sweetness that I like, but the Barbados was cooked so good that it was the winner for me. We had our tacos with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime and a sampling of their salsas. They have three salsa, an avocado roasted jalapeno it seemed, a fruity fresh tomatillo, and a spicy red pepper salsa. They were all great but I have to admit that the fruity fresh tomatillo was my favorite. The windy city fries was crazy, everything you would expect pastor fries to be and more, pico chopped fine, gauc which had big pieces of avocado in it (yum), and grilled onions! The onions were the kicker and set these apart from everyone else. The champorrado was different and had a banana taste to me, once I tasted it I liked it and liked the fact that it wasn't like everyone else's. The horchata was delicious, smooth, sweet, and had a creamy condense milk taste that was welcomed. All in all I felt like it was a great visit, the owner is humble, makes all of the food from scratch and you can taste the love. It the food continues to stay like this then it will be here for a long time and I'm happy with that as I will be back for more. Of your in the area...or not, take a visit amd try Chicago style tacos. You will not be disappointed.",

Ended up with the small portion of the Windy City fries. Only 5.99 but the portion was well worth more. Nice charred carne asada with great flavor and fresh toppings. Pico and guac were flavorful and delicious. The full portion for 11.99 would've been a good challenge but will take that on next time.   Service was fast and friendly. Quality was right on point. Will be sure to stop by again when back in the neighborhood. Highly recommended.",

Our food took about 30 minutes, but they kept apologizing and asking if everything was ok once we got our food. We didn't mind since we were really enjoying our food, which made the wait worth it. It was also a plus that the manager/owner even offered to let us try the barbacoa tacos and those were the bomb! The meat was soft and very flavorful. We'll be ordering those again!   Aside from the barbacoa, we ordered chicken, fish, & steak tacos. My husband is picky when it comes to meat, (doesn't like fatty pieces) but he ordered the thinly sliced steak tacos and approved! Even my picky 2 year old enjoyed her chicken quesadillas. They used \"beautiful pieces\" aka how we describe our chicken lol.  & The spicy avocado sauce is also a great addition on top of everything. It was a little too spicy for me, but I still kept adding more... it was that good!   Food and service were both amazing! We'll  be back soon!",

Once I realized where it was I said to myself wow I've driven past this place many times and didn't know it was there.. it's located in a small business complex but if you blink you'll drive right by it. Anyway the tacos were delicious my only thing I can say that I wasn't thrilled with is that they don't use crunchy shells they make them with corn tortillas... held up well as u ate them but I just like that crunch so I had two beef tacos and my boyfriend had two beef and one chicken but later on ran out to the store for a bag of potato chips because they are small but good value.... I could've even ate another one but I didn't want to be greedy  Tuesday special is between $1.50-2.50 it's a pretty good value I will definitely be back",

The VIBE is great, the staff is super friendly and helpful -- especially the adorable, little boy who took my order. He was so sweet, and helped me pick out what to eat on my first visit. I love that it's a small business, feels good knowing you're contributing to REAL people.  Today was my second time there, I tried their taco salad with carnitas -- life changing AF!  I never want to leave Vegas just because of this spot.  Best Hispanic food I ever ate, doesn't give me a sore stomach like other places, pretty sure it's because everything is fresh; and absolutely delicious.    The food looks and tastes incredible!  Action Bronson needs to put this spot on his show, F*ck that's Delicious!  So far I've tried: - Tacos with barbacoa and carnitas...out of this world AMAZING, and yet, so simple!  They even use yellow corn tortillas!  - Windy City Fries are to die for!  It's like food industry  GOLD, you'll want it in and all around your mouth.  I have no idea how those fries stay so crunchy!  They're magickal! A++++ - Taco Salad is GARGANTUAN, scrumptious and satiating.  I bet the list of tastiness doesn't stop there!  This is going to be our new spot after church from now on.  Mahalo, Chicago Style Taco Shop!  You guys are doing food right!  May your business thrive and be blessed with abundance and prosperity for a long time!  You bring happiness and good memories to people!",

I ordered lengua, chile relleno, al pastor, barbacoa, tripitas. My favorite was barbacoa, the tender and well spiced meat is my favorite personally.

    "text": "Friendly husband and wife taqueria team- they emphasize that their tacos are \"Chicago style\" which seems to mean that the yellow corn tortillas are fried. I didn't notice a significant difference in flavor, but the tortillas seemed to hold up better than elsewhere.  There is a good variety of meats and they all seem to be done pretty well: the asada was solid and the barbacoa was a surprise hit. Not only is it difficult to find barbacoa in Vegas, but flavor is hit or miss. Here, they use braised beef cheek for the most flavorful version I've found. I also liked the texture of the lengua.   In addition to tacos, menu has burritos, tortas, plates, and Windy City fries- basically asada fries, with sour cream, pico, guac, and your choice of cheeses. The barbacoa was especially good on this, but I would have preferred a different type of fry than the frozen crinkle-cut variety, which were a bit too thick for my liking. Toppings were super generous though, and even the small size will require you to share with a couple of friends.   Service was friendly but orders came out a bit slowly- keep in mind that this is a two person operation, so be patient. Food is tasty, wish I'd grabbed a torta to take to work the next day. I'm rarely on this side of town, but I'll be suggesting it to others to check out.",

My boyfriend got the nachos with carnitas and felt the carnitas where on the dry side but he still thought it was good over all but once he had a bite of my food he was regretting not getting the same thing. This location is really small and kinda hidden, it's more of a to-go place. A con is the menu, when you walk in is on a flat screen tv and it's really small I have bad eye site so I couldn't even see anything on the menu so good thing I looked online before going, and also it was kinda dirty when we came in but the cashier did help clean a table for us so that was nice of her overall I think I would come here again but only when I'm craving those Windy City fries",

    "text": "It's been some time since I've had a new, good taco experience. I had the opportunity to look for one tonight with several other Yelpers, so I took it.  Chicago Style Taco Shop is in a little North Las Vegas strip mall on Craig Rd, cross-street Ferrell (_not_ in the spacious plaza with Smith's and whatnot). The restaurant itself is pretty much a hole in the wall too, with seats for perhaps twenty. Even the cash register is on a narrow ledge, with the credit card machine closer to where the customer tends to stand than where the cashier does.  The owner and his wife were the only ones working. They moved to Chicago but came back to start this business, and they seem nice. I got offered free samples after I'd inquired about their Taco Tuesday specials (which are $1.50 but just for the ground beef and chicken), and those cups that I received were at least one-third of the actual protein of a taco.  The menu has pretty much everything that you'd expect in a casual Mexican restaurant: tacos, tortas, burritos, taco salads, quesadillas, a few breakfast and dinner options, desserts, and traditional drinks. There are also nachos and something that they call Windy City Fries ($5.99 for a \"small\" and $11.99 for what must be an unimaginably large portion). Gotta say that the fries themselves had a great balance of crunchy exterior and fluffy interior, and they were decked out with plenty of meat and toppings (cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream in sauce form). I could see myself ordering fries on my own, so thanks a ton to Stefany V for sharing tonight!  All of the tacos (whether $2.50 for certain premium proteins or $2 for the rest) come with a double-stack of corn tortillas, oiled and fried (but not to a crispy), plus your choice of veggies (had to go with onion and cilantro instead of lettuce and tomato, the latter of which feels too Americanized) and salsas on the side. The tomatillo salsa is mild, but the other sauces (the seedless green one and red sauce) were medium/hot (depending on your palate) and were somewhat uncomfortable to use. I tend to prefer spots that pick the salsa to complement the meat because it becomes a guessing game for a first-time customer like me to make the right choice.  I ended up trying most of their proteins, and I'll list/tier them from my most to least favorite:  - Tripas: intestines can be weird to some, but these burst with flavor and may be my new favorite because they're less overpoweringly salty than what I expected.  - Pastor: out of the tacos, these were my second favorite. They're the rendition with caramelized onions, and they're on par with the only other pastor tacos in this style that I've had (which at another local taqueria, actually). The meat is moist and delicious. - Barbacoa: made from beef cheeks and a perfect topping for Windy City Fries. Gotta love the fat. Wish I'd had this on a taco to see how well it would've worked out. - Cecina: this is actually a refried beans sandwich, with the tortillas as one bun and a giant hunk of tender beef as the second bun. Visually impressive and also flavorfully satisfying.  - Asada: didn't enjoy this diced steak too much on the taco because it wasn't marinated as far as I could tell, but it worked great with Windy City Fries. - Pescado: could flip flop this with the asada. Big hunk of slightly dry fish that didn't have that much flavor alone, but picked up a lot of flavor with the tomatillo salsa.  - Chorizo: finely ground seasoned pork. Better than the one other version that I've tried in that it really bursts with flavor without being too salty. - Carnitas: kinda on the dry side, which is an unfortunate trend that I've noticed with carnitas in general. Lots and lots of protein on a carnitas taco though. - Picadillo: ground beef. It's marinated and has corn and green beans (perhaps among other veggies), but it was underseasoned. - Lengua: beef tongue. just not much flavor here, with zero caramelization in the gray meat. Ranked this so low because it's one of the premium tacos.  - Pollo: chicken. Underseasoned. Enough said.  Overall, I experienced enough hits that I could see myself easily returning... but only if I ever found myself in the neighborhood. It's a great local taqueria for people residing in this part of North Las Vegas or in neighborhoods even more distant from the heart of Las Vegas. Otherwise, just bookmark this for when you're really that bored of all the other options.",

After asking for a towel to clean our table,  went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there was no soap. I then went out to get my fountain drinks, no Ice and the fountain was missing several syrups. Finally decided to just drink water from the dispenser. We ordered 2 three taco combo & 1 extra taco, mind you there was no one before us waiting on food & our order took almost 30min long. The salsas are tasteless and watered down, the tortillas are stiff & the meats are sliced as opposed to chopped and you can't distinguish one flavor the other. Overall this was not a good experience and definitely not in the top 10 taquerias in Las Vegas. Won't be returning & wouldn't be surprised if they get shut down for health/sanitary violations.",

They come fully loaded and cooked to perfection.   Girlfriend had the Taco Salad and it was apparently so good she started eating it before I could get a picture. The tostada is firm and melts in your mouth when you're eating it.   This place is very refreshing for Mexican food. Will definitely be coming back soon.",

It was REALLY hard to order because the TV was so loud. The didn't have any more green onions, they were also out of flan. So that was disappointing.  My order consisted of: -3 tacos (chile relleno, carnitas, and cecino) -horchata -fries with carne asada  My favorite out of all of those was the chile relleno taco. My sister wants to try this place after I showed her the menu so we will stop by again.",

    "text": "After having Roberto's carne asada fries for the one-trillionth time (they can only satisfy your cravings for so long), I decided to try this place out after seeing it pop up on my Yelp a couple times.  Location:  This is a fairly new business and has, to my knowledge, been only open for a few months. It is a very hole-in-the-wall place and you sort of have to look to find it. If you see a shop that has a sign on top saying \"Carnitas Taco Shop\", you've reached the place! Don't worry, I'm not lying to you. If you look at the door sign, you'll see that it's Chicago Style Taco Shop. The interior is honestly like how you expect a small, family-owned taco shop to look like. Almost every time I've gone, I've noticed the same people - most likely the family members of the owner - having dinner and relaxing in the shop, which really help make the shop feel more homey.   Service:  The owner, a man who greets you happily right when you enter the door, is so sweet! The first time I visited, he had no problem answering our questions. You could tell he has a lot of love and passion for the food he makes. When we were waiting for our food and there were no more customers up by the register, he took no time helping the cook make orders and make sure the quality was up to par.  Food: Tacos: The tacos were also cooked to order and were served piping hot. The meats were juicy. You could even request a choice of salsas, red or green, to top them with.   Windy City Fries: Though I still do not know the difference between Chicago Style fries and regular carne asada fries, I've officially converted from Roberto's. You can choose between a small (better to eat by yourself) and a large (to share). You get to choose the meat and cheese to go along with these fries and everything is made to order. After much deliberation, my cousin and I settled on a large thinking we were hungry enough to finish it. The large was more than enough between the two of us, and we even had enough to take home for a snack! The fries were cooked to perfection, not too crispy and not too soggy. The toppings - pico de gallo, guacamole, meat, cheese, onions, etc. -  were loaded on top and were more than enough to fill every bite with a burst of flavor. Why go to Roberto's when you could just drive a couple more miles to eat this plate of heaven? I may not know the actual difference between Chicago Style and Roberto's Style, but my mouth sure did!  I have officially turned into a fan of this shop. I see a lot of potential and I hope more people discover this place soon. It deserves to be recognized for the amazing food, service, and quality it has. Writing this review caused my cravings for their delicious food to shoot up, my mouth to salivate, and my stomach to grumble. I guess I know where I'm going for lunch tomorrow!",

Prices are awesome I mean, there isn't enough praise I could give this place.   It's a little hidden but look for the northern Vistas business center next to Toro taxes and it's just next door.    Worth the trip and will definitely be returning. Far better than Robertos, pepes, and tacos Los gordos...  wow.",

Chicago style tacos is frickin' awesome *said in my horrible little Nicky voice.... Because my friend is vegan and gluten free, not by choice so I guess I'll keep her, we Googled away looking for places close to us to grab a bite. Success!!!! This place pops up. We called in and confirmed that they did have vegan options so off we went. I got pastor windy city fries, and she got the vegan taco.....Holy guacamole. Everything was delicious. Praying to the taco Gods that the first experience wasn't a fluke, we continued to visit frequently. The staff is fantastic and the food is consistently delicious.",

First and foremost, the staff were super friendly. They treat us so well!!   We had Al Pastor, chorizo, carne asada, chicken, barbacoa, cecina and chile relleno tacos. They were ALL amazing. Our favorites though were al pastor, barbacoa, and chile relleno.   Hats off to the chef!!!   The green salsa that we used was pretty good. We added it to all the tacos.   If you've never tried a Jericalla, I suggest you try it. It's kind of like flan, just not as sweet.   Just overall...an amazing little place.",

Overall a pretty simple combination, but that's what makes it awesome. You can order tacos individually, or get them with a meal that includes beans and rice. They also have breakfast options that includes burritos. The prices are a little steep compared to the last place that was here, and the wait is a little long, especially around lunch time when a crowd comes in and there is only one chef. I like to come here when I get off work if I'm feeling like tacos, but I had to stop coming in on my lunch break cause it was taking too long. All in all though, a good place.",

I will go back for the good food but if this isn't corrected they will chase away newer customers and myself no excuse for laziness especially when you have a hidden gem as they do with the food so food gets a A plus the cleanliness of the dining area gets a D need cleaning and updating the cooking area was open to see and looked clean and was being utilized as a kitchen so Chicago Style Tacos ,, you are great but please get a hold of the cleaning person and keep it up to par salt pepper and proper utensils knifes etc and maybe replace those chairs that are falling apart and torn and you'll be there for years to come.",

All the flavors blended together makes the burrito 10x better. They've done a lot of renovations and improvements to make their restaurant cleaner and more modern.

Even though Tacos el Gordo is closer and more well known, I am now a HUGE fan of this place! More so than Gordo. The meat here is much better. I've tried the asada, cecina, pastor, lengua, barbacoa and carnitas. Every single taco is better than Tacos el Gordo. The meat isn't oily/greasy, and their salsas are great, too. The tortillas were just the right size for the amount of meat- which was overflowing.   When I came here last week with my husband, we each got the 4 taco combo. It comes with rice and beans, which I don't usually eat, but they were great. The rice was super fluffy and flavorful. The beans were creamy. I liked it, and thought them to be of the same quality as Lindo Michocan.... Maybe even a little better.  This time around, I got the 4 taco combo, little T got a small Windy City fry with just fries and pastor (hold the pineapple, please) and we also shared a side of chips and salsa. I love the salsa selections. The red is my favorite- super spicy! The chips were good too, not greasy and crunchy.   We came around 6 and there was steady traffic in and out, a combination of sit down and to-go orders. We didn't have to wait in line but we did have a bit of a wait to get our food. I'm good with that- it means it's fresh. And I know it is because you see them make it right behind the counter.   T's fries were so fresh and crispy! No pineapple either- thanks guys! My 4 plate combo was awesome, as it was before.   As stated before, I'm REALLY glad my husband had us go back. We'll be regulars here for sure!",

The only thing that I have to complain about isn't even that bad; the barbacoa tacos were delicious but a little on the soggy side. Not sure if that's a \"Chicago\" style or not \"hence the name\" other than that everything was awesome. Especially the young man at the register. He was extremely polite, professional, helpful, and just seemed really happy overall. Great place to try. Oh also the prices were not ridiculously over priced, like other popular taco shops.. will definitely be back.",

It's dirty, they mess up on your order and the food just sucks. We have given them many second chances, thinking we just got a bad cook that day. WRONG! The quality, cleanliness, care and passion for cooking no longer exists here. Eat elsewhere!",

    "text": "I have to update my review. Our family decided to dine in on this visit on a Saturday evening. I've been going to Chicago tacos for a while now and we pick up food pretty often. I ordered my usual tacos pastor without onions. Plate came out and the meat is completely different than what they've had EVERY single time I've been there and there's tons of onions and no pineapple (this came automatically with pastor). Lady taking the order doesn't speak good English so she asked a younger guy to help translate. I explained politely that I ordered no onions and he said the mixture already has onions   ?? I asked him if they have a new mixture now for pastor because it never had onions and came with pineapple. he said no it's been the same. Seems odd because the meat was large strips compared to a chopped style meat before. None the less I take the plate and decide to pick out the onions but I couldn't even eat the tacos because it was very spicy !!! Again I bring my plate up and speak to the younger guy and see if they could possibly make a different meat because it's very spicy.  The young guy storms off and pushes the work cart out of frustration.. very very uncalled for as I was polite to him and the other workers.  I then have to wait about 15/20 min as he purposely takes his time to remake my plate .. great food but this very uncalled for , not sure if I'll be back   Great tacos !!!!! Nachos are soooo good , loaded with a ton of meat. Also ordered the 3 tacos. Pastor, carne asada & chicken. Great prices !!!",

We were sitting in clear view of the cooking and food prep area and the work area where they were preparing the food was filthy and yet they were working in the filth. The floors were gross. There was old food under the cash register and work areas and by the fryers. It just needed some deep cleaning. Last the tables for diners were nasty. Again we loved our food they just need to deep clean their restaurant and I'll come back and gladly give 5 big stars.",

You can choose any kind of meat you want for your fries two different kinds of cheese, and the portion they give you is really good.  If you haven't tried Chicago style taco shop then you need to take a trip down there and try their food which is really delicious. I highly recommend this place, try it for yourself you will not be disappointed!",

Service and food quality is consistent, but the prep/wait time for your order can vary drastically. I always order the 3 veggie taco combo which comes with a side of rice, beans, and a drink. This plate fills me up for sure. The sauces they offer and great- and can knock your socks off so be careful which one you choose.  As far as cleanliness- I would give it 2 1/2 stars. Not sure how long the taco shop has been there, but it could use some more modern touches and a good scrub down. I have seen few cockroaches (dead) down the hallway towards the bathroom. And during one stop- I saw what appeared to be either a friend or family member of the owner take his lady friend into the storage room next to the soda machine and they laid down together on a bed with the door open in plain view of the customers..  Anyway-- I still will go to eat here, but usually get everything to go.",

    "text": "Once again, thank you Yelp!  I was in NLV and hungry, so I turned to Yelp for some guidance on something tasty and cheap.  Chicago Style Tacos pops up and it's only .3 miles away.  I head over to a little plaza and initially can't find it.  I see a Carnitas Tacos, but no Chicago Style.  I circle the plaza and see a Chicago Style banner hanging in the Carnitas Tacos window. It's held up by some duct tape.  Uh oh...do I dare go in?  Am I going to regret this?  I'm starving so I enter.    It's pre-lunch so I'm the only one in there.  I ask the guy what the difference is between Chicago style tacos and others.  After all, I'm from LA and have had some of the best taquerias in the world in my backyard.   He says they use yellow corn tortillas instead of white.  And they make everything fresh to order.  Umm...okay.    Now my initial concerns from the exterior aren't alleviated when I walk in.  They don't have cash in the drawer so it's cash only at the moment.  Their fountain soda machine isn't working.  Ugh.  Anyways, I'm hungry so I order three tacos: asada, pastor, and pollo. Plus an old school glass bottle of Coke for $1.  Food comes out and it looks great.  They have three sauces:  Spicy Red, Spicy Creamy Green, Mild Green.  I take turns between the two spicy ones and both are delicious!!  All three tacos were delicious too.  Next time around, I would have a hard time ordering just one of the meats. They're all equally tasty.    Yea, the place is a dive.  But service was good, prices were right ($2 each taco), and the food was fresh and delicious.   I'll be back!!",

Honestly I am surprised we liked this place as much as we did, but I can hardly wait to come back.

Joe (not sure if spelled right) the owner welcomed us as we walked in and even though he was sitting down taking a break and enjoying his own meal, he went out of his way to introduce himself and get to know us.   As for the food, it was freakin delish!  We weren't aware of what \"Chicago style\" actually meant, but there is definitely a huge difference in flavor when compared to other taco places.  I ordered the chicken taco salad and my boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito.  The chicken was shredded just perfect and consistently, and they were over-generous on the amount of meat in each meal.  They place 3 variations of hot sauces at your table which all were distinct and flavorful.  The portion was large enough to where we each took home leftovers for another meal later on.   The restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating.  Parking wasn't a problem as it is connected to a plaza of other small businesses.  This will definitely be our go-to spot!",

The tacos were topped with cilantro and onionsThe meats were chunky in a good way. They had 3 different spicy sauces.I enjoyed all the tacos. Really really good!

There are a bunch of comfy leather bar stools, which made it harder for me to want to leave. Good call, CSTS!  I ordered the Tacos Combo (fish, steak, and chorizo), which includes 3 tacos with your choice of protein with rice, beans, and a drink. My drink of choice was a mandarin Jarritos. All 3 of my tacos were decently good. The steak and fish ones were a little dry, but nothing a little salsa couldn't fix. By the way, I chose their red salsa. My favorite of the 3 was the chorizo taco -- because it was a little spicy and well seasoned.  The Tacos Combo was very filling, and it only cost me about $10!",

We came in at 8 pm and they weren't busy, which was nice. Lady who had taken our order was really friendly and helped us with the menu. I ordered the Windy City fries with chicken and two barbacoa tacos. My husband ordered Windy City fries with pork and a chicken burrito. The tacos were amazing. My husband enjoyed his burrito. I think the only complaint I would have is the fries weren't crispy enough so they became wet and soggy. I think they are using the wrong type of fries for this dish. Other than that, experience was good.",

Which is amazing considering how delicious they were! I highly recommend this place if you want real authentic Mexican flavors!  PS. The prices are great too!

First, they are in a plaza that you cane easily drive past so pay attention to where it's at. Its pretty small inside, but of course hole in the wall places are always the best. The cashier was so nice, she helped us pick out our meat and also gave us samples of all their freshly made drinks. We chose the tacos- chicken, carne asada, and barbacoa. We also ordered the fries since we wanted to see what all the fus was about. The chicken was ok, a little dry, maybe wouldn't get that again. The barbacoa was AMAZING; tender, juicy, and all around bomb! Carne asada wasn't anything to rave about since it's pretty much a staple at all taquerias. The cashier recommended next time to try chorizo and cecina. Definitely will be coming back and trying their different meats. Their green sauce is amazing as well. They usually give 3 sauces, green that's mild and a red and green sauce that has a little more kick. I'm a huge fan of the medium green sauce, it adds to much more flavor to their already flavorful tacos.",

We ordered chicken nachos (beautifully done with very flavorful chicken), pastor tacos with a heap of pork, and ground beef tacos with lots of cheese, tomatoes and lettuce.  Three sauce bottles are brought to the table - two sooo spicy but good.  For such a small shop, the menu is large.  The shop has light bright and clean tables and atmosphere.  Family run and we enjoyed chatting with them.  I loved this place so much I had to load the yelp app and post my first review ever!  We will be back!!!",

When we finally had the chance that night to eat dinner there, it was already closed after 8pm (place closes at 1000pm)! We were upset because we was so looking forward in trying out this place for the first time due to the wonderful reviews and was wondering why they were closed. Leo, stepped out of the restaurant and informed us that they ran out of Tortillas. We were quite bummed out. I informed Leo that it would of been the first time for us to try out this place. He looked at us and invited us to come in and was going to muster us a meal. We were grateful, but declined after he insisted to accommodate us. We told him that we will just return tomorrow, which we did to give this place a chance. We returned the following day and this place didn't disappoint! Everything we ordered was delicious, full flavored and the salsa options were awesome! Leo noted we returned and apologize again for the inconvenience the night before. He hooked us up and the rest of the staff were welcoming and wonderful! We surely be returning regularly again!",

Also the beans and rice were great. It was all pretty great except for the guac and I think that might be kind of a personal preference thing so 5 stars.  Also the tacos are pretty small. I could probably eat 6 but I'm really into tacos. I'm going to go here again and do that.",

The kitchen is open so you can see them prepare your food while you're at the counter. The young lady who helped us was very personable, welcoming and helpful. I explained it was my first time there and she took the time to go over the menu, explained the options and even pointed out the popular dishes which is always helpful. She was very patient as it took me awhile to finally decide what I want. (Never go to a restaurant when you're already starving!!) I ordered the Windy City fries, a variety of 6 tacos and jamaica to go. The tacos are street style which I love and they were delicious. I got the carnitas, pollo and barbacoa tacos. The Windy City Fries were delicious as well. I didn't know what to expect at first but wow!! They were very flavorful and filling. The small size is more than enough to share.   The restaurant was clean. It looks pretty new. Everyone was nice and welcoming. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Seeing \"Chicago\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars.   The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!  I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.   Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.  I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.",

I've been to many places that can come close to this style of food, yet, this one has exceeded my expectations. I am truly happy my family and I decided to come and eat here. It's a very small space (about 7 dine-in tables) but definitely worth it all. I ordered 3 tacos al pastor, my husband ordered the nachos. Everyone else in my family (in-laws and cousins) ordered different plates. All where 100% satisfied! Will be definitely coming back here!!  Ps. Churros are great too!!",

Couple things I didnt dig was how long the wait time was for lunch considering there was only 2 orders ahead of me and an almost empty resturant lobby.  The next thing that was a bit less then kosher was that the tables was all pretty dirty. As I sat down my hand kinda did that velcro sticky thing when I picked it up from the table! Yuck!!  Then I look over my shoulder and there is a mother with her toddler sitting diaper exposed on top of the table while she waited on her order. Gross. Please if you have kids dont put them on eating surfaces where there pooppy diapers spread all kinds of bacteria to would be customers.  That table never got wiped down while I was there. Dont think I can come back after that.",

Went in yesterday since I was randomly on the northside of town, they must have been having a/c problems because it was warm and muggy inside (but still better than outside).   Ordered the 3 taco combo with carne asada and al pastor. The meat was way overcooked, almost beef jerky style, and the beans were obviously from a can. The rice, meh. I also got the smallest slivers of limes known to man, only two of them for three tacos. I had to ration my lime juice to cover all three tacos, it was a sad day.   There are hand-written signs everywhere, the soda machine was randomly in the middle of the room in front of a open-door closet with a sign that said, \"do not mix/change sodas on refill.\" Also, looked like a bullet went through the front door.   Maybe I came in on a off day? However, I won't be back to find out.",

There was a BUNCH of asada meat on there though. We ordered plain fries for the kids and they came out 5 min after our Windy City fries, so the kids just sat there and watched us eat.

There's nothing different about it other than the time it takes to get your food. The only Chicago about it is they probably had the good delivered from Chicago which caused them to take so long to get my four tacos. Seriously. Been here before I I was the only one and it took like 20 mins to cool now I come back it took more than 30 minutes. Food is mediocre and service as well.

I had to send a few  texts to someone so I ended getting to the door at around 10:08. The door was locked but I could see people inside(who glanced at me and  didn't even acknowledge me). I looked at the door and yeah it said 10am. So confused I walked back to my car and as soon as I got in a lady came up to the door.. turned on the \"open\" sign and then unlocked the door and walked away. Still not acknowledging me. I said well I'm definitely it going in there now and drove off. Those people hate their job so why would I trust them with making me food. If I went back in they may have spit in it. Seemed like that type of place based on my first experience of it. I don't recommend it at all. I worked in a hotel/casino and service is our first priority.

We ordered the chicken nachos and 6 tacos (2 chicken, 2 asada & 2  barbacoa). We had to wait a long time to get the food as well because of the lunch rush but everything was DELICIOUS! It was way too much food for two people. The chicken nachos are huge and can probably be a meal for two on their own! The tacos were awesome. All the meat seasoning was really good and the salsas were great. All the workers were really nice. We asked for a to-go box for the nachos and the lady working there added some more sauce to the nachos before we left. I really enjoyed this place. Only thing stopping it from being 5 stars is the wait for food and their air conditioning.",

Also grabbed a ground beef Quesadilla and it was also huge and the flavor was unique and a breath of fresh air. I would usually pass up a Mexican food shop but this one was worth every penny as its sort of like a fusion between american and Mexican.  The hot sauces they provide are all homemade and they stamp a sticker on the containers so you know when they were prepared. The Green, Red, and they had this other sauce that I kid you not tasted like Raviolis to me. Go here and enjoy.",

    "text": "Perhaps I haven't frequented much Mexican establishments, but I'm giving this place 4 stars for serving me tacos so fresh that it was hot picking up my taco, that I had to put it down to let it cool a bit.   Husband and I decided to stop in after our little afternoon date. We were the only ones in there...so we were immediately greeted by a woman who seemed pretty jolly.   We didn't order the windy city french fries as everyone else in the reviews have raved about. I mean, at the end of it all...you're pretty much eating french fries with all the Mexican fixings. Quite frankly, I wasn't in a french fry mood anyway. I wanted me some tacos.  Between the 2 of us we ordered, 2 Carne asada tacos, 1 lengua, 2 barbacoas, and a carnitas. You have the choice of either lettuce and tomatoes orrrr cilantro and onions in your taco. We opted for the cilantro and onions. I absolutely LOVE how they give lots of cilantro. Some places I've been to give you lots of onions and some cilantro. As a cilantro lover...I noticed it immediately and was like, hallelujuer.   The lengua (tongue) was the husband's. Definitely not something of my fancy. Lengua is served in 2 thin slices versus the typical chopped up version you'll normally see. Husband thought it didn't make too much of a difference sliced vs chopped. He enjoyed it. Typical. He said the barbacoa was on point and couldn't get enough of it.  I had the Carne tacos. I enjoyed it, but I thought it was a little on the salty side. We arrived fter watching a movie...perhaps the salt in the popcorn was still lingering in zee mouth?? Impossible. Although twas a tad saltier than expected...it was certainly edible, yet, still found it to be pretty good. Hungry much? My carnitas was definitely the winner for me on this round. Perfectly seasoned, had the right char to it...twas certainly my fave between the two.   We were also given 3 different bottles of their sauces to go with the tacos. Don't know the names but I'm assuming each bottle is named, spicy as hell, spicy as hell, oh...and spicy as hell. We also ordered chips and salsa....spicy as helllll. I'm not a professional spicy as hell eater, but I can take a little heat. All their sauces and their salsa was spicy as hell. Moral of story, if you want a little hair on your chest, then hair on your chest shall be granted. Jokes aside, the creamy light green bottle was the most spiciest between 'em 3.  We spent about 20 bucks between the two of us for 6 tacos, a large horchata, and some coconut candy my husband couldn't resist. He is a huge coconut lover.   Will we be back? If I'm in the mood for some tacos, most definitely! Personally prefer this place than Taco El Gordo, hands down. Stop dropping your jaw, gotta read my El Gordo review to understand why. I think there is literally just 1 cook, and your food may take a little longer than you'd expect, depending how busy they are...but it'll always come out FRESH, which is important to me.  They offer small sizes for the quesadilla and other items which is great if you have children.  I recommend not ordering to go unless you live real close or else you'll miss out on the fresh serve. Then you'll spend your time griping on yelp.  If you need a taco fix, taco salad fix, quesadilla fix...it's definitely worth the try!  They're certainly kid and stroller friendly! Just don't roll up in those double, side-to-side kind of stroller.",

I went with their suggestion of Windy Style Fries.  You can do small or large and your choice of meat and nacho cheese or Monterey jack and guacamole and sour cream at no additional cost, wow!  I went with the small and it was still huge. The meat I chose was carne asada, and for cheese -Monterey Jack. This was my first asada fries so I can't compare but they were very good and even the small was definitely great for sharing.  I also had to try one of their tacos. Taco Cecina (beef) which is meat that has been salted and dried by means of air, sun or smoke. It was served on a yellow corn tortilla which I am usually not a fan of since they tend to be hard, but this place really changed that for me. it was delicious! The tortilla was smothered with a little bit of refried beans, the nice size piece of steak, cilantro, and onion accompanied by some lime Mmmm!    I got to try my hubby's taco of tripa and chile relleno and they were also delicious!!   A plus is that they also serve breakfast and they have a pretty big and affordable menu. They have so many meat choices and styles so I can't wait to come back and try them all!",

The cook kept touching his clothes, such as his baggy pants & never changed his gloves afterwards.   & once I left, there was two customers waiting for their food & as I left out, the cook started to talk about me because I wanted to know how my order was packaged together!",

The food here is very honest and flavorful, the sauces are delicious and make it fit nicely.   The service here is family and warm, you're in a neat place. Great food! I am always asked to recommend a good Mexican restaurant and it's hard for me to say because I only eat tacos or I will only go to a place and eat one thing there. Anyways, next time they ask I will send them here.   This place got a bad rating from me the last time and it made me feel bad. I am no food critic and I eat anything and in all fairness, my score has more to do with service and prices. This place has always been a five star restaurant.

    "text": "Came across this joint here on Yelp. Seen the 4 1/2 stars and 500+ reviews. Thought, hot dang, place has to be good. I don't know how long this place has been here but I have lived up the street 7 years and had never even thought of going and finally said alright I'll give it a try. I'm not big on changing up where I eat. Well, this place is one of the reasons why. I have to be honest, I don't know where the 4 and 5 stars are coming from and in such abundance. I will start off with this though, staff was friendly. A teenage girl working the register and 2 teenage looking dudes working the kitchen and an older guy there, maybe the owner.  I ordered a small windy city pastor fries and 1 pastor taco. Was $9. The fries tasted like grocery store bought fries. Not much flavor in them. Tasted like oven cooked fries with no seasoning. The pastor, I have way better when I go to friends' houses. It was pretty tasteless. I don't know how long the meat is marinated but I don't think it's near long enough. The best tasting piece of the fries was the guacamole.  The last thing, literally a minute after I ordered, the girl comes out to hand me a bag full of barbacoa tacos. You literally took my order 60 seconds prior and you don't know what I ordered so she goes to the table next to me which was the people who ordered right before I did to give it to them and they're like nah but what we would like is our drinks. Then, I proceeded to wait 23 minutes for some fries and 1 taco. Like I said, I don't know where this abundance of 5 star reviews are coming from but this is definitely not a 5 star establishment. Or 4 star. Or 3 star. This gets 1 star. Had I not waited so long, on a Monday night at almost 730 at night, then it would have got 2 stars. I can see waiting 15-20 minutes on a busy night like Friday or Saturday night. Not on a Monday night with not that many people there.  And why is it called Chicago Style Tacos? Everything was regular Mexican food. Only thing Chicago anything was the name of The Windy City fries. Fries, meat, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. That's it. What makes them Chicago style.  Bottom line is, I think I will just stick to the places I know best.",

The first time there the cook was an older gentleman he look like the owner and he had a son or some younger guy working the counter. The food was really good the tacos were good they had flavor the nachos were good the Carne Asada,  it was good. Fast forward one month I go back last night and this young kid cooking looks like his mom or somebody and then another young girl. What is the kind Asada burrito and the nachos with Barbacoa. First of all the varicose like something that you pull out of the P-trap in your sink, globs of hair,  it was disgusting ... Second, the Carne Asada had no flavor whatsoever and was loaded with fat....  That's about all I will say at this point but I will never go back to this place for it has disappointed me like many of the places in Las Vegas that just aren't consistent with their food.",

    "text": "I typically get threaded at Eyebrows R Us. Afterwards, my boyfriend and I were hungry and decided to stop by Chicago Style Taco Shop around 5:00 P.M.  Wow this place is busy! There was a line pretty much right out the door! There is booth seating on the right side of the restaurant and table seating scattered across the restaurant. It wasn't clean inside, but I can imagine why! There was just so many people inside the restaurant.  The menu offers a wide variety of Tacos and their Fries. My boyfriend ordered the Fries with asada and al pastor [large]. I selected the chicken quesadilla with a side of sour cream/pico de gallo.  Our meal came out to be slightly under $25.00 with a large fountain drink. Since there were so many people inside the restaurant, we did end up waiting for our meal, approximately 25 minutes before it arrived to our table.  We were quite surprised at the portions! Both the asada fries [al pastor] and chicken quesadilla was large! It was enough for a breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The Chicken Quesadilla was scrumptious! The cheese was perfectly melted. The tortilla wasn't burnt and the chicken was flavored perfectly. The chicken was shredded, not in chunks. It was also seasoned with a little red spice, but wasn't too hot. The fries with asada and al pastor was also good. The fries at the bottom was crunchy, not soggy. The asada was really good. It felt like the flavor just melted in your mouth. The al pastor wasn't overpowering on the meal either.  I'd come here again, but perhaps during a less busy time at their restaurant! Great food though!",

It's pretty standard Mexican cuisine with a tiny sprinkle of Windy City aesthetic. For the most part the menu is tacos and burritos, but what caught my eye was one of the few Chicago related items, the Windy City fries. The portions are pretty big. I couldn't finish my fries and my friend had to take his monster quesadilla to go. Pretty small place so I can imagine it gets packed during prime meal hours.

I would like to try their tacos but unfortunately I will not be going back to this place. Their cleanliness is way below average for a restaurant. A lot of their used/dirty supplies are left out on the counter, the supply room is open, i found a roach on the hallway leading to the bathroom, the walls are scratched. Overall, these factors just don't promote the basic cleanliness needed to run a restaurant. I am by no means a clean freak, but i simply would rather not eat at a restaurant that comes off as dirty.",

He brought our food out, checked on us at appropriate times and offered to clear our plates when we were finished.   A definite place you must eat at because the food is flavorful and the service is outstanding!!!   Get the fries! They aren't like your normal fries!",

    "text": "I recently checked out this place after wondering what a Chicago style tacos would be like, only to find out that there is no difference aside from the time it takes to make them, and the fact that their food tastes like Taco Bell.  When I walked in, there was a group of three people sitting at a table, presumably waiting for their food already, and then I ordered a burrito.  From time of ordering to when they dropped the burrito at my table, 27 minutes had elapsed.  Seriously, 27 minutes to make a single burrito?  Ridiculous.  To make matters worse, the burrito was super greasy and most resembled some of that ground meat garbage that one can get from Taco Bell (for a quarter of the price in about a tenth of the time).  For no reason should anyone ever go to or return to this place.  Terrible.",

My boyfriend got the Windy City fries with asada and al pastor. We also got two tacos, barbocoa and al pastor. Where to start? The tacos were amazing!! Especially the barbocoa. It was so tender and flavored amazing. The fries were so good! They use crinkle cut fries. They were crispy and delicious. The large is enough for two people or enough to have for two meals, it's plenty! Overall, flavor was delicious and everything tasted authentic.   Customer Service: The men working that Sunday were so pleasant! The cashier was extremely nice and attentive. He was very helpful on suggesting what their popular items were. The cook was also very nice. He brought the food out to us and asked if we needed anything else. This place has a real family feel. I felt like I was at a family members house for Sunday dinner.   Overall Experience: I would recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Mexican food! The restaurant is clean, the cooking area is clean and the food is great! A+",

When we got there were very surprised at the lack of professionalism and order in the establishment . First, The area where you order was crammed and it was hard to maneuver to order and the worker even took our order from our side of the counter . We placed our order and as we Waited VERY patiently (you have to have patience here) it took AT LEAST 30 minutes just to get our tacos and all of our food came separately within a 30-45 min time span . As we began to eat we noticed the meat was SEVERELY under seasoned , we had to add salt to everything and the salsa had no kick at all or flavor . The idea of the salsa was so much better than the taste . And to wash it down we had a soda from the soda machine that was nearly out of syrup and it was obvious . Our view was a dirty kitchen and the two workers speaking very loudly  about how long everyone's order was going to take IN FRONT of the customers . There was so much wrong with this place I think 4 1/2 stars was VERY excessive but , different strokes for different folks .... You've been warned",

The food blows away even some higher end full service Mexican restaurants that are very expensive. The owner and workers were very helpful and friendly. They offered a sample side of their pork with pineapple and it was out of this world. I'm very picky when it comes to food as I worked in a restaurant for about 20 years.

The staff was super friendly and inviting. (They even turned on a cartoon for our 2 year old)  The Windy City fries were very flavorful and I was surprised how big the large size was! The breakfast burrito was so big we had to bring half of it home!  We got a chicken taco, carne taco, and a pastor taco. They were amazing! And the red sauce on the table gave it that spicy kick I was craving!  The small quesadilla is the perfect size for toddlers and young kids.  We will be back!",

My wife enjoyed a chicken torta. She loved the flavor of the chicken.  To top things off, we split the Windy City fries which are a meal itself. Everything was excellent.

For being a fast food type place it took a long time for them to make the order and it was colder in the restaurant than it was outside.   If you plan on eating from here order by phone and wait about 40 mins  I liked that the burritos had lettuce beans and tomatoes in them but my al pastor burrito was primarily just that. Where was the meat?  We ordered the small Chicago style fires with ground beef and there were chunks of ground beef so burnt and charred that it was hard as a rock.   The portions are good for the price you pay.   I think this place has a lot of potential but not sure I'll be back any time soon.",

    "text": "Chicago style tacos is a Mexican street style taco , I'm not sure what makes it Chicago style , but these tacos are very tasty. The torllias are yellow corn soft and tasty a step up from most taco shops . The asada carne is moist and fresh ,and best of all it does not have the fatty chewy pieces that slip in most other taco shops.The price is reasonable inexpensive making this a good value for your dinning dollars. This is my second time here and definitely won't be my last. The place is run by the owner , a friendly enthusiastic fellow . There is no language barrier issues as the staff speaks English fluently,  or if you perfer to order in Spanish that is spoken as well. Good food , good service,  the shop it self is not aw inspiring but don't let that fool you this place is good eats.",

I wouldn't have minded except it was a Sunday afternoon and I was there with my husband and for young kids.  The language and videos were very inappropriate for my kids who were all ages eight years old to one-year-old. I mean I'm talking vulgar images and language. Like I said if I wasn't there with my kids I would've just ignored it but definitely not cool when you're eating with your family",

The rice and beans combo was a smaller portion than other restaurants but the quality and flavor made up for it. Anyway, you really shouldn't have so much rice and beans ;)  We loved the variety of sauces. I fell in love with the avocado sauce and they preferred the spicy habanero.   The sodas were cold and the place was clean. It's a fast food place not a fancy diner so don't expect a chandelier...lol   Their service was great. Both the cashier and the cook interacted with us and asked for our feedback. I took some stuff home and it traveled well. Just wish I had asked for more salsa in the bag. It was really tasty.  Definitely recommend! The barbacoa was my favorite meat but I did enjoy the quality of all the meats we tried. I can't wait to go back and try the Chicago spacial and the fries.  Thanks for a great experience!",

Not very satisfying. I also had carnitas taco, Which was very dry. I also had a barbcoa taco, which is a little more juicy. And one small barbcoa quesadilla which was good but very very oily. Their sauce was great. And the horchata just tasted like the powder form.   Saw the reviews on yelp. So I decided to try this place out. The restaurant is very small. The appearance of the restaurant sure made it look like a hole in the wall spot which is what usually makes a restaurant great!. But overall the restaurant wasn't my cup of tea.",

I hope they get their AC fixed soon! Other than that problem I would return.",

When I came as a first time customer at 9 pm on a Friday night, I was with my sister and we were not greeted or looked at for the first four minutes as we stood in front of the register.   When we finally were, an older lady with thick eyeliner did not speak English well and took our order of fish tacos and windy city fries which cost $18 and took nearly half an hour to get to us. Actually, it was made in 25 minutes but the old lady was in the back hanging out and didn't wrap our stuff until five minutes had passed, at which point the nicer guy who speaks English told her to get to it, so she did.   The Windy City fries were good, but if she's working the front I'd not bother ordering from her.",

The fries were decent, but the meat was not seasoned. They come with the regular fixings: sour cream, guacamole, pico de gillo, and choice of nacho or mozzarella cheese or both. With all the toppings, there wasnt much flavor. I will say the serving size is great for the price and the service was quick. I ordered a small, and it was enough for two people.",

The 3 taco combo is a deal at $8.50.  For that inexpensive price, you can choose from asada, cecina, picadillo, barbacoa, pastor, carnitas, chorizo, or pollo.  I tried the cecina (thin salted steak) for the first time based on other Yelpers' reviews and it was excelente, as were the other tacos.  The combo also comes with rice, beans, and soda, so the price is certainly right and I got to watch Lady Gaga tear it up on the flat screens, too.  Give this small taco business a try and you'll see what Chicago style is all about.",

Well what I got was called tortilla chips with Just white mozzarella cheese just thrown on top cold not even melted with little pieces of steak that had a lot of nerve in it it was just disgusting the meat was overcooked the service was just very Poor. There was no ice in the machine the soda no carbonation water down I don't know what was going on in that place that day but the last couple of times the service just is very disappointing the quality is just going down the drain I wish the owner would come back and take charge of his restaurant???",

Fast foward a couple of weeks later, Wifey comes back raving about their Cecina(Thin Salted Steak) Tacos stopping by after work one evening, and if she says it's good, IT'S GOOD! The 5 stars do not lie! This is a definite diamond in the rough in all of Vegas' taquerias. SHAME ON ME for diving away the first time!  Locally owned, family run, and clean little taqueria with just a few tables and chairs, the service here is great as well. Don't know what really differentiates Chicago style from say, Cali style, but all I know is that they serve some damn good tacos! They have some of the widest variety of options I've seen-  Asada(Grilled Steak) Cecina(Thin Salted Steak) Picadillo(Ground Beef) Barbacoa (Braised Beef Cheeks) Carnitas(Shredded Pork) Al Pastor(Marinated Pork) Chorizo(Spicy Pork Sausage) Pescado(Fish) Chile Relleno(Pasilla Chili with Cheese) Pollo(Chicken) Lengua(Beef Tongue) Tripas(Beef Intestines/Chitterlings)  Aside from Tacos, They also offer Tortas, Burritos, Combination Plates, Nachos, Loaded Fries with your choice of meat and even Beakfast items. I decided to go with a Cecina, Chile Relleno, and Tripas Taco. Yellow corn tortillas are used here, and they oil them up just right, so you don't feel like you're eating a piece of cardboard. Tacos are topped with cilantro and onions with some lime on the side, and while they do not have a salsa/condiment bar, they do have three different salsas in squeeze bottles and escabeche veggies(Carrots and chiles in vinegar) I enjoyed all my tacos that I got that I had to get two more Tripas tacos...If you're a fan of Tripas like I am, request them \"Bien Doradito\" if you like 'em a little more crispier! Bonus also for having agua frescas made from scratch!  Looking forward to returning to try other menu items. If you're ever on this side of town and craving some tasty comida Mexicana, check this place out!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  5",

    "text": "The restaurant owner is a nice guy whose family has a few stores open in Chicago. The original Vegas location was downtown by CCDC, but they moved to Craig pretty recently. You can easily tell the owner is passionate about the food he makes - as he wrapped my burrito up, I couldn't help but think of the similarities to when Spongebob lovingly tucked his Krabby patties into their buns and read them a story. The sign on the storefront reads \"Carnitas Tacos\" but there's a small banner in the window that actually says \"Chicago Style Taco Shop\". Nestled in between an Asian market and a nail salon, this small taco shop is easy to miss!   WINDY CITY FRIES ($5.99, small): My husband loved this entree and trust me, a \"small\" is more than enough food! These fries are loaded up to the brim and make an excellent carry-out dinner. 5/5  NACHOS ($7.50, asada): Husband ordered this on his second visit and was a fan of this entree as well. He barely made a dent in this hefty serving of nachos. 5/5  VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($6.50): Comes with all the toppings stated on in the menu, (beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, tomato, avocado) plus rice. On my first visit, everything went off without a hitch. On my most recent visit, it went like this: Onions: 1, Me: 0. Onions seriously make me nauseous, like I will start gagging if I attempt to consume them. The cashier listed all the ingredients in the veggie burrito, and onions sure as hell wasn't one of them. I get home, and there's tiny diced onions freaking everywhere in the burrito! WHY? For the love of humanity and all things good, please do not add 'surprise' ingredients to my burrito. 3/5   There's no fountain drinks and the restaurant is pretty small, so I'd recommend getting take-out. Burritos to be honest, are on the smaller side (comparable to Frijoles and Frescas). I'm still definitely a fan of Chicago's Style Taco Shop, and am looking to trying more menu items. I see you horchata.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #268",

I have to say I was a little nervous at first because it looked like the inside good use a deep cleaning all over, but after seeing all the buzz on yelp I decided to give it a try...... Then seeing what Loren F. mentioned about the cleanliness in her review after I had eaten there kind of made me think about not going back even if I did like some of my food because I noticed some of the same cleanliness issues.   Tacos Combo ($8.50) - 3 tacos, rice and beans with cheese are in this combo. You can choose from different meats it doesn't all have to be the same kind of taco, so I went with 3 different tacos. The carnitas, chicken and pastor were all tasty meats. I actually ended up just eating the filling with a fork and it tasted good. I wasn't sure what \"Chicago Style\" tacos were, but according to Stefany V.'s review it apparently means that they serve yellow corn tortillas that are fried. I personally found them to taste hard and stale which is why I ate the inside salad style with a fork. I also didn't get the tomato slices they put on the tacos when chopped tomatoes just make more sense. The rice had great flavor while the beans had crunchy bits, yuck. Lots of hit and miss here.   Windy City Fries ($5.99 for small size) - The fries come topped with your choice of meat and pico, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. I asked for no meat and extra beans instead and they made it that way with no problem. The problem I ended up having was the beans had crunchy bits just like the beans with my taco combo, no bueno. The fries actually held everything up well and didn't get soggy which is a plus and the pico and guac were pretty good, but those crunchy beans ruined it.",

All I gotta say is lock the restroom door when deuce in it up jeffe.",

The Windy City fries are a must have, being an inventive spin on the ever so common carne asada fries.  The Pastor is like nothing I've ever had before. Crispy, buttery, luscious pork morsels grilled and seasoned to perfection. Try it on anything! (Add the pineapple, you won't regret it.)  Whatever you order, be confident you will be taken care of by a local small business with awesome food and great service.",

I came in with my 3 kids and I was informed we had to take it to go because they close at 7pm. This place if trash and it does not say anywhere that we have to order to go 30 min prior to closing! I hope the owner makes some changes if he is the one implementing this rule or at least make it known that sit down orders will not be taken after 6:30pm!",

Definite favorites were the pastor and barbacoa. The carne asada was great as well. The meat was tender and juicy with little need of actual hot sauce.  The fries were deliciously seasoned and full of meat. Definitely could only finish half of a small platter. It's quite substantial for one person.  The one thing that really didn't hit home was the atmosphere. It felt like a regular taco shop that had a couple things decorated to make it look like Chicago. If ambience was changed, I would've stayed longer.  Outside of that, I would definitely come back and order again.",

The only thing I have to say is if you're planing to come here to eat be aware that they keep their ac almost completely off! You can read the reviews others are saying about this too, so it definitely wasn't broken, they just either keep it at over 80 degrees or they don't turn their ac on . My grandmother, mother, myself and my two children were all SWEATING! My sons 1 1/2 and his face was completely red and his hair was even WET because of how hot it was! That's the only reason why I'm not coming back because typically when you go somewhere you want to eat, relax, enjoy.... right?",

It's located in a little strip mall down the street a little from Craig ranch park.   When you walk in it's super small and kind of a dive aka you know it's going to be delicious. All their tacos are made fresh as soon as you order and they provide you with three different salsas as well. Personally I loved the thicker green salsa which was similar to a spicy guacamole type.   I decided to go with three asada tacos and let me just say they were amazing. Each taco was only $2 or you could get a combo which included three tacos, rice, beans and a drink. The tacos were super fresh and flavorful. They come the traditional way with onions and cilantro. I added a mix of the green and red salsas, bomb.   I can't wait to come back here and try some other meats. So excited to have this so near by for lunch time!",

Then, while waiting on my order, she gave me another customers order, thank God the lady was friendly about the MIX up because I'd opened all of her food, but I hadn't touched it. Still I probably wouldn't have wanted it. After about 15mins she got my order out to me 6 tacos. 4 plain tacos and 2 w/lettuce, onion, cilantro. They came out piping out and smelling delicious!!!!! They also were made correctly!!!! We dined inside and the cashier w/limited English was friendly while we dined in. I'd go back! Prices weren't too bad. 6 tacos were $12.

My favorite are the pastor (pork) and the asada (steak). Top these babies with one of their three house made sauces and you will be smiling in no time. Their windy city fries are a must try when you come here. They are fries topped with your choice of meat, cheese, guac,  sour cream,pico, and salsa.

It was well balanced with shredded chicken, avocado, beans, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and tomato in an excellent soft bun. I asked the woman who served us why Chicago was in the name and she said it was because all the ingredients were fresh. Works for me. My sister wasn't as thrilled with her tacos as I was with my torta, but they were decent. Thank you for the good lunch!",

It was kind of hard to find because they have yet to place an updated sign up. The place looks like your typical hole in the wall, very clean though. They have a large menu with a ton of options but it is not at all overwhelming. I was greeted by two friendly faces who explained the story behind the name and that they've been open for only two months. The man behind the grill seemed super confident saying they're style is totally different from any other taco spot out here.. Bring it buddy! I ordered the small chicken and barbacoa Windy City fries for $5.99 a piece which were more than enough for a single person each. I got really excited  when I saw him scooping Guac out of a small bowl like he made it just for my dishes.  I took it home with some sauces and everything was so amazingly fresh.. The fries stayed crispy, everything was full of flavor. They really focus on every detail that goes into their dishes. The sauces are extremely potent, which is great because I like it hot! I got full before I could finish my fries. I feel like I got more than enough bang for my buck. And I can definitely see myself craving more trips to Chicago Style Taco Shop in the near future!",

We've tried a few places and Chicago Style Taco Shop was stumbled upon by his boss. He took my dad step mom and me there tonight.. we tried the Tacos de asada, pastor, and pollo. And we had the nachos de asada. Everything was hot, fresh, and so good. The red salsa was spicy and it was the best. We definitely found our spot, took us almost 2 years but it's okay. My step mom is a hard food critic and even she liked it. What made our visit even more special was Joe came out of the back and asked us about our visit. We got to conversation with him for a little bit and it was a pleasure. We definitely will be bringing family and friends and spreading the word about this spot. Good job Chicago Style.",
