The guys that work there were on a positive note, and those chicken fingers and fries are just delicious, the only thing that I didn't like was the amount of people, the place was full, that's because I came at around 3pm, and that's the time that hungry students get out of school. They need to get a bigger place for sure, because those chicken fingers have a big future! They deserve every star of the five that I put.",

Shoestring fries also good, the price for the combo is very fair.  Why only 3 stars?  Well, I hate to pile on but previous reviewers are right - the tables/eating area is a dump.  Come on Chicken Shack, either hire someone to clean up the place or have one of your current workers spend a few minutes out of each hour wiping down tables, emptying trash and mopping up.  My shoes were sticking to the floor it was so bad.  I told myself that the cleaning problem was probably just limited to these areas, since I wanted that chicken, but it's not hard to extrapolate and think that the kitchen might not be so great either.  These aren't the kind of thoughts you want your customers to have.",

    "text": "We were recommended this place and since we were on that side of town, we decided to try it. It's in one of those strip mall centers on the corner of Sunset Road. The reviews about this place being small are correct. There are only 6-4 top tables and 3-Deuce tables. The decor and cleanliness is very fitting for the name as it did remind me of a shack with it being small and had that \"dirty\" look. I'm not sure if it was the floor color or what but, you can decide from the pictures. I couldn't get the whole place because there were obviously people in here.We ordered the 5Finger,fries and drink combo, 10 Fingers and a 3 Finger & 3 Finger,fries and drink combo which all totaled about $30. From the reviews, I was excited to try it because my ultimate Favorite is still Raising Canes even over Chic-Fil-A... have yet to try PDQ. I must say that I was not impressed. The fingers were bland and the fries tasted like straight oil. Perhaps our chicken would've had flavor if I didn't ask for sauce on the side(another tip I got off of here) but, even with the sauce on top, I'm sorry but, it still only qualifies for a ranking of 3stars. On a good note, the fingers are a very good size hence, the reason why I'm giving 3 stars and not 2. I would be willing to give a 5 if this place were bigger, cleaner and tastier.",

    "text": "This is our new go to wing joint, and let me just get this out of the way...This place serves some big ass wings!!! My husband and I crack up every time, wondering where the hell do they get these chickens?!  Soo.. big juicy, crispy well cooked wings and delicious sauces. (we've only tried a few so far) The chile-lime was yum, the habanero honey was sweet/spicy heaven for me. Both kids like the honey bbq, and occasionally we order the dry spiced wings for when we don't feel like getting down and dirty. They have lemon pepper and garlic parmesan, both good. The fries are super skinny, and that's a nice change...very crisp.  So why not 5 stars? I hate that they offer big packages, 25, 50 or 100 wings but you may only have 2 different flavors in those packages. I don't know if it's like that at other places or not, but regardless, I think it's lame.  The second reason is that there are always dirty tables. Every time we've been, we've searched for the least dirty table and watched the other ones sit there un-wiped for the duration of our stay. You may be  understaffed due to the economy, but the tables have to be wiped down. No one wants to sit at someone else's mess. On the bright side, you can phone in your order, walk in and pick it up and bypass the dirty tables.",

One day, our preshopping hunger was going to cost us way too much money in the grocery store, so, we decided to give the Chicken Shack a try.  We both got the chicken finger and fries, with a fountain drink for both of us. Looking at the menu, if I was a fan of wings (too much work, not enough food) I could see myself diving into their AYCE wings. With such a wide selection of sauces available, you could eat your fill and still not have tried all of their sauces (maybe).  Our food came out pretty quickly, and tasted quite good. My main complaint is that the fryer oil appeared to be very old, as our fingers were dark and a bit tough. The high level of grease soaked into the batter was bordering on being too greasy.  That won't be our last visit, I hope to give them a shot, and see if we can time it to be near when they change the fryer oil.",

I asked the cashier \"When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky\" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel \"Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance\" he replied \"sure\". As he walked away with his back turned to he says \"a please would be appreciated \" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with \"cool story bro\" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional. When I spoke to them they mocked and asked me what they should do \"sit him down and give him a stern talking to\" with a huge grin on their face. They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day. They shouldn't take it out on their customer and if he can't deal with customers then he shouldn't be working in the customer service industry. I can honestly say that I will not be returning to chicken shack not after the complete disregard they showed for customer satisfaction.",

There's something about the batter on the chicken pieces that makes it taste so good...it's also spattered all over the fries.  It's just a nice, greasy, deliciously unnutritious meal.  I have to slightly recommend the wings over the fingers though, as the fingers are a little thick and dry.  I tried the BBQ and mild sauces this time, and the mild was nasty.  I'm not a hot wing guy, so I'd definitely recommend sticking with the honey BBQ or teriyaki sauces if you're anything like me.  TIP: The fingers taste better if you let them marinate for a few minutes in the styrofoam \"to go\" box on the way home...a lot juicier and tastier than dining in.",

Three fingers is the right size if you're alone, unless you're super hungry. Five is a bit high unless you're sharing with a friend or two, Sometimes, they'll throw in an extra finger if they think that your pieces are a little small.  I have to start with the fries. They are the best shoestring fries I've had anywhere. There's just something to the flavor that draws you in. Don't put ketchup on them though. I don't know why, but that destroys the flavor for me. You can dip them in sauces (see below).  And of course, the chicken fingers are the main point of the restaurant. They are large. They are crunchy. They are tender. And they come with dry or wet sauces (note: get wet sauces on the side if you don't want to destroy the crunchy texture of the fingers). Come back multiple times and try many sauces.  I have no darn clue why there isn't a lemon-lime soda option here. That's the only negative that I have to share. I would probably just get a small cup for water if I could, but a drink comes with the combo.",

Even on days the line stretches to the door, I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food. Often enough, they have it ready before I can even put the lid on my drink.   The ranch is top-notch, as are their fries. And quite often, you'll get more than what you ordered.",

    "text": "I don't entirely know why, but I'm kind of obsessed with Chicken Shack. I'm rarely on that side of town, but have noticed it on my way to Ross J's. It looked kinda ghetto so I stayed away till a couple weeks ago when Ross J's was closed early. I'm glad I tried it because I'm a little addicted now.  I'm probably kind of biased because their plain wings taste just like when my mom makes korean chicken before she dips it in the sauce. Nostalgia is a funny thing, but I do think they're also just really good wings.   Price is about $1/wing and many have mentioned that's overpriced, but that seems standard to me for restaurants - BWW is about the same. Chicken Shack also has huge drummies and wings, not broken or midget ones like a lot of other places. I'm a fatty, but I was full off of 6 wings because they're bigger and meatier.   For sides, we've tried the cole slaw, baked beans, and fries - only the fries were really good crispy shoestrings, I'd pass on the rest and just stick with wings. For sauce my fav is the habanero honey (not that spicy) and garlic parm. The bbq and sweet chili were pretty standard, but I also liked the wings just plain because they had seasoning already.   Service was great and the tables were clean the 2 times that I've been, with guys coming out to wipe down tables as soon as they're free. I hate nickel and diming - they charge for ranch/blue cheese and extra sauce, but what can you do.  I also agree with others who've said that their chicken fingers are dry - stick with the wings.",

The fries were good. The chicken was juicy but I feel as tho they could cook their chicken wings and tenders just a bit longer, give it that crisp. And it could use some more seasoning, wasn't impressed with the seasoning on the food at all. So decent spot but it won't be somewhere that I'd set out to go to in future unless by passing.",

They do not try to be like wing stop or BBW and we should all respect that. But they offer tossing you sauce for you anyway. Also another tip don't eat here it's small and busy so it's best to get in line order Togo and take it home. I love their chicken wings and dipping sauces Mild sauce and sweet chili and garlic Parmesan are my go to sauces but I will try more next time. The wings are a good size and cooked perfectly. They don't overcook it like BBW to the point where you get a mini wing. One of my fave spots to stop when I'm on this side for sure. They seem to be putting out a great product but I think they need more space to operate more smoothly.",

My orders here are very eclectic, but I'd say my favorite is the Hot BBQ with a side of Hot teriyaki and spicy bleu cheese. It might sound a little strange, but even if you're just dipping their delicious fires in the teriyaki, it's totally worth it.",

    "text": "Located near the intersection of Sunset Rd. and Mountain Vista, which I like to think of as \"old Green Valley.\" This place is definitely a beaut that contributes to the other mom and pop owned places in the area. Chicken Shack was a typical eating spot for me while I was attending USN because my classmates and I would come here during our lunch breaks or after school before we would get our study on. And yes, all the raving reviews are correct. From what I've tired, probably the best chicken wings in LV, so this place is a MUST TRY!   I've noticed that I am a tough critic when it comes to the breading because Raising Canes is a little thin, while KFC is so thick I just opt to peel all the breading off. However, Chicken Shack has the perfect amount of thickness and also has nice crispy texture. Seasoned very well and they offer different types of flavors too like Wing Stop or BBW. The fries are also delish, thinly cut with extra crispies (almost the same as Yard House fries). They also have an all you can eat chicken option for $12.99, but I don't exactly know what it comes with. But I found that interesting because I've never seen such a thing at a chicken place. The only down side is you have to pay extra for ranch or blue cheese, which in my opinion kinda sucks.   I really like the mom and pop vibe of this place with the friendly staff and decorations.They even have their specials written on a chalk board. All of it really makes everyone feel welcomed.",

The food is way salty which is good for some people at some times(the bf loves salty ass food), but my firm belief is if you sell food, don't nickel and dime for stuff that makes YOUR food better. For example, making me pay a side price for some (veggie sticks)celery and carrots, ridiculous. Celery is literally a dollar for a giant bunch. Charging for ranch? At a dedicated chicken wing place? Wha??? I mean, where is any logic there?? If you want more than one type of sauce, charge. I mean really...  I am a frequent craver of chicken wings, fingers, anything crunchy and salty with some hot sauce and celery. The celery is a must. I still think it is  a travesty that some fast food pizza places have the audacity to serve wings and yet do not carry celery. I frequented this place a lot at first, but after a while spending over ten bucks a pop for a single meal just so I can get some celery and ranch with my meal is ridiculous. Now I just head over across to (casino takeout)...which is good but I would rather support small business.",

I took it back and kindly asked for it not to be super dark and the lady at the cashier (short black hair, white Mexican looking, with gauges) rudely said \"that's how they are cooked\". I just asked to get another batch and she said \"that's just be oil\" but I've been in the food industry. The oil needed to be changed or filtered. Ive only had issues with this one cashier. Then I go to get fruit punch Gatorade and it was out. I kindly told her it was out and she said okay and didn't do anything about it. I was there for 30 minutes and asked her 3 times and nothing got done. Chicken shack is a great place but not recently. Very disappointing with the service.",

If they could brake the habit of serving old fries (cause we know the difference) then they would be a 5 star spot. I'd rather wait a few more minutes for fresh fries rather than fast food with old fries.  Other than that we are 3 years loyal.",

    "text": "Here's the deal with this location located on Sunset Rd.   The chicken is good as long as it's not overcooked. In my experience of going to this location at least a dozen times it's about a 50/50 chance of whether the chicken will be really good or flat out burnt. I have learned to ask for the chicken to be cooked on the spot and to say \"don't overcook it.\"   The manager has not been very professional on a couple of occasions. She basically didn't want to hear about the problems in her store and just proceeded to talk over me. I wasn't to happy about this, but I did like the chicken so I was eventually willing to overlook this and she was more professional on visits thereafter.   What really pissed me off big time was on my last and final visit. The girl who works the register (heavy set, short dark hair, butch looking) did something which I find pretty bad. We ordered our food, I sent my 17 year old autistic child up to the counter with a $1 bill to buy an extra dipping sauce which is 59 cents or there about. He gave her the $1 bill, yet she didn't give the kid any change. She just kept it. We are only talking about .40 cents or so, but that's not the point! She knew the kid didn't know any better and she took advantage of it. I walked up and said something, but she acted as if she didn't know what I was talking about.  For these reasons and mainly the last, I will never return to this location ever again. The employee who did this is constantly on her phone, tables are dirty, floors and walls are dirty, yet she stays on her phone instead of cleaning.   This has been my experience, yours may vary.",

First things first:  Pros: Short drive from my house Cheap combination plates Festive decor   Cons:  Was a little put off at the guy mopping the floor while I was eating.   The food is amazing!! And they give you a LOT of it. I ordered the #4, 3 chicken fingers,  3 wings, fries & a drink (with ranch)  $10 & some change. The fries, shoestring, are so good and seasoned (which is rare out here cause everyone is afraid of seasoning). I couldn't even finish. Ate 1 finger and one wing, handful of fries, and I was done.

Inside, the walls are decorated with license plates from different states. It has a pretty cool feel to the place, but it can get crowded given the fact that it is small.  Since I was buying food to feed 4 people, I ordered the shack pack (your choice of 25 wings OR 20 fingers, two large sides, and 4 drinks for $34.99). I opted for the chicken fingers and chose the macaroni salad, potato salad, and the coleslaw for my sides (I decided to get an extra side item instead of the 4 drinks).   The chicken is supposed to be their showcase item, but it ended up being more of a letdown. The fingers are a good size for what you pay for and they're juicy when you bite into them, but the fingers I got tasted like they had been cooking in old oil (it wasn't that pretty golden-brown color, but more on the darker brown side). The sides were alright. The macaroni salad and potato salad were the better of the sides. Unfortunately, the coleslaw looked like it was put in a blender before serving. It was more on the sweet side and really watery.  They didn't deliver on the wow factor, but I'm willing to give Chicken Shack another chance.",

Woman wearing a backwards ball cap at the register is super rude, I've been brought here by some friends a couple of times and she's always been working. She's very short and makes you feel stupid if you can't hear what she says as she mumbles questions to you. You can tell she doesn't want to be there as you compete for her attention with her cell phone.   Bottom line the food is great. But I don't think it's worth the bad customer service, and I mean it's a chicken place, it's not that hard to take an order. It's so dirty in there too. They have other locations so just go there instead of this one.   **Update** they have a new team and have cleaned the place up. It's perfect.",

    "text": "We arrived a bit early to see Mad Max at the Galaxy Luxury Theater, so we decided to find something to munch on to kill the next hour. We found a few places nearby on Yelp! and saw the solid reviews for The Chicken Shack and decided to check it out!  What i liked...  - Had an order of chicken wings and an order of chicken fingers, serving size was generous and both the wings and fingers were plump and meaty! I like! - they do give you a generous portion of ranch sauce, but if you wish to have an additional or different sauce there is an extra charge for that - Beer on tap for decent prices, especially compared to what you will get at the movie theater. - very fun and chill atmosphere with the 90's music playing and funny little phrases adorning the walls plus a ton of license plates and other unique little things - Service was pretty quick, and they were pretty busy when we were in there  What I didn't like...  - tables were not very clean. Having someone just wipe the tables down between customers would make a big difference - customer service was spotty. Some of the guys were very friendly while others would barely speak  - this place is very small and when it gets busy, it can feel cramped quickly  Others items to note..  - their soda fountain consists of Pepsi products - this seems to be a very popular spot for the high school/college aged crowd. Nothing wrong with that. Merely an observation. Lots of \"dude\", \"man\", and \"bro\"'s were being flung about recklessly.  I really am so back and forth between 3 or 4 stars on this place. The wings were nice and plump, but lacked any kind of seasoning or flavoring. The chicken meat on the fingers were excellent! I will definitely be back to try out more menu items and snag some more of those chicken fingers! After a couple more visits, I could easily see myself bumping this up to 4 stars. For now though, I like the Chicken Shack, but it's just..  A-OK.  3 stars.",

I have a catch phrase of 'Shack Sunday' because we always come here to get our wings during football season.  They open at 10 so it's perfect for game time. They are located off of Sunset in the Smiths shopping plaza so it's easy to find with ample parking.    Now let's get down to business- the wings here have stayed consistently huge, succulent and flavorful.  They offer a huge variety of sauces for the wings.  All are great.  The hot sauce and the honey habanero are our favorites.  You can choose to have them tossed in the sauce or on the side.  Tip- if you're carrying out, get the sauce on the side and toss them yourself when you get home.   I hate to leave out mentioning the over addicting shoestring fries.  They do not skimp on these tasty sides.  The BBQ baked beans are also a favorite of mine. It's always a tough choice of mine which side to get.    Customer service is reliably top notch. They treat us like one of their friends every time.  They are always friendly and make a point to say hi even during a busy time.  I always appreciate their kindness as well as the amazing food.    Any day is always a great day for wings!",

It was shredded up while they chopped it up. I tried to use ranch to make up for the dry chicken but had no luck. I used one and a half ranch cups on less than half the salad and it was still dry! It had 3 pieces of sliced cucumber and 5 cherry tomatoes atop a bed of chopped romaine lettuce and two pieces of red onion. It was sprinkled with croutons and cheese which was probably the best part.   I had some of my bfs chicken fingers and fries and they were good. That Chicken was dry as well and the batter was soggy. Dipping it in the honey mustard seemed to remedy the problem.   Overall, i recommend ordering ahead so you dont have to wait in line. The dining area is way too small and hot. The fried chicken fingers and fries are good, but i personally prefer Raising Canes any day.",

So a few weeks later, I've double verified that I have it all signed up correctly. We go in today and I ask if I need to let him know I've got the cash back Groupon signed up.  He says \"oh, that is the valle verde location and not us\".  He says this right away.  Well aware and this Groupon has been on for months.  So I say the Groupon doesn't say one location only and everyone knows that Groupons do specify a single location.  He says he can get the manager.  I say ok.  The manager comes and say \"nope, not this location and it is for valle verde only\".  Has nothing to do with us.  However, he could have a sign, he could call headquarters or Groupon and he is well aware of this False advertising and that he is getting customers who assume they will receive their rebate, taking their business in silence and out right knowing people will order anyway once they have came in under False pretenses.   I told him that this was my second time coming in for the promo, I lived around the corner and would be a potential regular customer....I watch a lot of football!   Wings are needed.  Lol.  He just says, sorry and that is that.   I said that if he didn't honor the promo, I was leaving without ordering.  So we left.  I do not like False or deceitful businesses.  Everyone in the store was well aware of the promo and that they were not honoring it.   Groupons do have Specific store only addresses.  He is well aware that he is intentionally having people come for the promo and then not honoring it or letting people know he is not honoring it.    Btw, u.s. halal chicken is a block away and great food and great service and wonderful staff who appreciate your business and go above and beyond.  Please go there and leave these unethical \"business\" owners to their own kind.  I appreciate people that don't use deceptive practices as business models.",

The chicken is seasoned and juicy. You get to choose your flavor of sauce. The portions are generous. I always am given an extra tender and tons of fries.   I can't believe I've been going to Canes all this time.  In-restaurant dining can get crowded. They don't have a lot of space to meet the demand. Tables are full of paper towels which is much better than napkins. Drinks are small.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I come here every once in a while for chicken tenders. We would come here everyday but unfortunately it's across town from us but when we are on this side of town we come here. Well this visit was different because I ordered chicken wings instead of chicken tenders! Their chicken wings were a game changer. I will never order anything else but their chicken wings. They are so damn good like you can't go to any other fried chicken ever again because they are that good! They are buttermilk battered and fried just like the tenders. But they seriously taste like miniature fried chicken! Omg.... Drool. I've literally been trying to find a fried chicken place and now I can finally stop looking. Chicken Shack won. They won all the awards. I don't care what anyone says. Man like after I finished my meal I wished I had another basket of wings...  Another thing though, their service was spot on seriously. We went in there at peak lunch time. People clocked out for lunch and headed over here. The line was basically out the door. But they were so fast and efficient it was amazing to watch them work. We literally ordered, got our drinks, haven't even sat down for a minute and our food was already ready. Talk about fast food. And that was literally everyone's orders too. They barely sat down and their food was already done. It was piping hot and their portions are always generous. They always give you extra. My boyfriend ordered a 3 finger combo and they gave him 2 extra tenders. He almost mad that he got extra tenders because he couldn't eat it all haha. Chicken shack is always the best choice for chicken tenders and wings.",

    "text": "I should have been smarter then to be fooled by the TV ad for this place.  There is a reason I have driven BY this place for years without stopping.    The young lady who took my order had the charm of a wet mop.  There was no greeting, just a \"what do you want\".  When I said I needed a second to decide, I got an obvious eye-roll, and a slump in her posture.   There was no one behind me in line, but I felt like I was bothering her just by being there.    I had chicken fingers with fries, and a small cup of macaroni salad.  One should be aware going in that EVERYTHING is ala cart.  U don't even get one dipping sauce for the overpriced fingers without paying extra.  Speaking of the chicken fingers ... definitely one of the worst I've ever had.  They were very tough and stringy.  The crust was plain-ass flour!  I don't think the chicken or the breading had ever SEEN any seasoning.  Bland, bland, bland!  That, on top of the chewy chicken made them a ZERO star item for me. The macaroni salad, while WAY overpriced, was pretty descent.  At $2.50 for about 1/2 cup, it should have been good! The tiny cup of honey mustard dipping sauce (which was a 50 charge) tasted just like the Kraft dressing of the same flavor. The only thing that was actually good was the order of fries.  ($2.50 for a small).  They were the shoestring type, which I prefer.  They are about one and a half of the 2 stars I gave the place. Would I return?  Only if I was VERY hungry, and everything else was closed.",

The meal that I got was six pieces of chicken, and included a drink. Somehow, this ends up close to $11.  $11...? That's like charging me a dollar for every piece of chicken. Then charging $2 for a handful of fries, and then $2 for a drink, plus tax. I just think that's a little steep.  I get home, and I didn't have tenders, I had wings...and they are wimpyyyyyy!!!

I walked in and looked at the menu and thought to myself that I could put down a 5 piece chicken fingers easy so I better get some wings to back them up. The portions here are huge and they also have the best fingers I've had in town so far. I was delighted. I love Fried Chicken so much that I drive to L.A. just to eat at Roscoe's, The Chicken Lady, and KyoChon. I am happy this place is here because I would have to drive to L.A. for it too.  Thank you Jaime W. for letting me in on your little secret. I'm hooked, I need to come back here again.",

If you want to know where all your cox workers are well come have lunch and you will see lol. We arrived about 11:00-11:30 and it wasn't packed just a few ppl but in 30 minutes this places filled up and it was a Saturday. Ok ok let's rate the food the chicken was ok nothing I was in awe about it satisfies your craving though if you're having one. I will be back I think maybe I didn't order right maybe I will try a different flavor. The fries were yummy but what I loved best was the bacon cheese burger we order.....go figure right but it was hella good! Well that's all I have for now but the experience and food were good you should go check them out",

But its not a burger place. I go to this spot a lot. It is on way to work, I order on way stop in and head back out to work. Once they get to know you it is like family when you go in here. (customer service is job one here. the parking lot has been under construction due to smith's new gas station so it has been a bit inconvenient getting in and out. They are always busy so that is a good sign. Chicken, Josie likes the Garlic Parmesan I am a fan of the regular wings. If you order in they have beer on tap as well. This Chicken is so crunchy and juicy. Big wings with a ton of meat. You can also order sauces to go with you. I like that they offer blue cheese as well as ranch.  I go back again and again. You need to try this place. I believe they have other locations, however I have only been here. They know me by name so what's not to like.",

The tenders are white meat and no gristle or unwanted \"parts.\" The breading is light enough that it doesn't fall off and crispy enough that it's not a chore to eat. I think it was seasoned well too. The sweet chili dipping sauce had just the right amount of heat and not overly sweet or gelatinous in texture, like some \"sweet/sour\" sauces can be. For takeout during a lunch rush, the wait was less than 10 minutes for an order of tenders. Also a plus, will be back!!",

I have tried the hot BBQ and just regular buffalo wing sauce both were OK. Upon my 2nd visit I politely asked what sauce they recommend, the lady taking my order was kind of a bit## , she just said,\" the sauces are on the menu\" in a snide way. The fries seemed pretty good but mine were doused in salt. What's kinda bs is they charge you for ranch or any sauce. That's like ordering nachos and paying extra for cheese, also there's no celery to bite into when your mouth is burning. All that aside, I didn't think this place was anything special. I will probably try it again if there is a spectacular sauce someone can reccomend and I have better customer service.",

So astray that I feel inspired to leave my two-cents.   The fries were soggy. I like a fry with a good bit of crisp, but without too much crunch where it is overcooked. These fries must have been sitting around for a long time. The chicken was terrible. For a place being named for their chicken and still being open, I'm surprised it lasted this long. The chicken fingers were just as soggy, the breading fell apart, and there was no seasoning. I can't believe I spent money on this.  The only thing this place has going for it are the jokes on the walls and its variety of amazing sauces, which had some kick!  You're better off with Raising Cane's. It's cheaper and better quality.",

I really don't have another chicken restaurant to compare this to since I've never been to Raising Cane's due to the distance, but this place is mouthgasmic enough for me. Chicken Shack is just minutes away from my house, it's cheap, and service is fast, which makes this place a great choice for poor medical students like myself.  The tenders are deep-fried to a crisp, moist, and comes piping hot either drenched in a sauce of your choice or on the side if you so please.  You can also ask for a side of ranch to cool that palette if the sauce is too spicy. The fries taste fresh and definitely beats any fast food chain.   I'd come here every week if I wasn't worried about growing another chin or fucking up my arteries...but alas, I'll limit my attendance to every few months because my hyperactive thyroid is now slowing down and soon, i will have to eat just lettuce to stay alive.",

I was pleased to see that they had am array of different seasonings and sauces to go with your chicken. Including chilli,  hot,  mild,   lemon pepper,  and sweet garlic.  I decided to get lemon pepper seasoning,  and a side of honey mustard.  The chicken it's self it nice,  crispy,  and juicy... Magically everything you could possibly want in a chicken tender.

The place definitely has that mom and pop feel to it. The walls are decorated by license plates and 'why did the chicken cross the road' jokes. They even have a couple of arcade machines if you get bored. The menu is pretty standard for a chicken place. They have wings, fingers, fries along with several sauces. They also had a burger, coleslaw, and some other stuff but I mean c'mon who gets the cheese burger and the chicken finger restaurant?  The fingers were great, juicy and moist and good size. The shoestrings fries were just like the ones you would find at other restaurants but a good addition to the meal. I had mine tossed in the hot bqq which had a perfect combo of spicyness and bbq flavor. The honey bbq and the lemon pepper are also great.   While I thought the food was great I did notice that the service was pretty slow. I understand they really focus on fresh food, but it should not take 25 minutes to get chicken fingers out. It's a fast food restaurant and even some sit-down places are quicker than that. I also think its a bit pricey for chicken fingers, a 5 finger combo is close to $10bux. Still def worth checking out if your into chicken.",

My husband remembered that we wanted to try this spot and we knew it had to be done.  This spot was busy on a Saturday afternoon which was a good sign. We decided to get our order to go and it didn't take long for it to be prepared. The guy at the counter was friendly. The prices are great as well.  I really liked the chicken fingers. There is plenty of white meat and the breading is really good. The breading was light and seemed like it was made fresh for our order, not kept in a heater until served. The French fries were really good. The large order was way too many fries, a small would have been enough for two to share. I'd been craving macaroni salad and this macaroni salad really hit the spot. I loved it. The sauce options are crazy. There are so many. We ordered about six because we couldn't decide. My favorite was the Honey BBQ with the Sweet Chili coming in second.   Great food and great prices. This spot definitely beats the chicken chain that is completely overrated.",

I thought that was really nice she noticed and talk about attentive! She made me feel my preferences matter in just noticing that one thing. I ordered a large fry and had no idea it would be so huge. Great value. I love that they're thin. Added a side of ranch and blue cheese. Seemed to be ample sauce. The mustard potato salad was truly southern and tasted homemade possibly.

This small restaurant was jammed with people which is always a good sign. I got the 5 piece Chicken Fingers with fries. Calling them fingers is misleading as they are very big cuts of breast meat that are expertly coated and fried to perfection. The seasoning on the chicken was a letdown as it was way too salty. The sauces are all house made and my Honey Garlic helped out my salty chicken quite a bit.  Overall a decent meal that is close to being great once they get the seasoning down.",

    "text": "Alrighty, although there were a few minor issues I have to say this is my new favorite wing spot. I walked in and was greeted by a cool cashier chick with tats and a hat. She led me to order the #1 which was 6 wings (I chose 3 medium and 3 garlic parm), fries and a drink for around ten bucks and within 10 minutes they were yelling my name that my order was ready.  The wings are large and meaty for the record but when I bit into my first medium wing it was an odd feeling of wonderful flavor mixed with disappointment that it wasn't as hot in the inside as it was on the outside. My next wing was garlic Parmesan (plain wing with some powdered Parmesan) and that bad boy was nice and hot on the inside.....idk why, but they were oddly different temperatures. The fries were whatever, there were a ton of them but they weren't anything special. The ranch was fine too but I'm a dipper and I should have asked for two.  I could almost live on those medium wings (next time I'll try a few lemon pepper) but I won't be ordering the boring garlic Parmesan again and depending on the occasion I'll probably just go for wings without fries. Lastly, there is only one small bathroom and it wasn't a dump just a little dusty here and there.",

Latest visit the place already looked trashed, sticky floors, the floors around soda dispenser area was wet.  Come on, they just opened? I was hesitant on ordering chicken because if front of house is a hot mess what about the kitchen? Went against my better judgment and ordered my combo meal from the surly cashier.  Well now I remember why we don't come here so often.  Some pieces were good, some salty, most pieces dry.  Ended up with upset stomach even though I ended throwing most of my meal. Sigh.  So this update is more a note to myself why we pass on this place.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never reviewed this place. Chicken shack is my spot! I love hot wings but I love lightly breaded plain chicken wings with sauce on the side better!  Chicken shack serves wings, tenders, chili, beer, and crack fries. Their wings and tenders are lightly floured and are also huge. I always get the wing, fingers, fries, and soda combo. I think it's a #4. It comes with 3 wings 3 fingers, their shoe stringish fries, and a soda. I believe this combo is $8.95. It is A LOT of food. Last night the guy even gave me an extra wing AND finger. Kudos! I ended up taking four pieces of chicken home.  For flavor recommendations I suggest the lemon pepper or garlic parm POWDER flavoring or the hot sauce. The hot sauce had the perfect amount of heat with a slight sweet note that I adore.  I love my sauce on the side when I eat chicken wings and imagine having these breaded wings thrown into sauces would be too much.  They get REALLY busy, but the food comes out quickly. I think for the freshness and taste that the prices are fair as they do give you a lot of food. My only gripe is that you might have to clean the table you want on your own as the turn around is quick and there isn't always someone to wipe it down.",

After some deliberation, I decided to go back in and order. Again, the lakers beanie guy was there and asked what I wanted. I ordered a 5 piece but changed to a 10 piece. At this point, the computer was giving him some trouble so he asked a lady to come help. She was wearing a baseball cap. While she was fixing the order I asked her a couple questions about the sauces and what type of sauce went on the hot wings and such, to my surprise she replied rather rudely. I had never been to the restaurant before so I figured they were reasonable questions but to her it seemed like I was really interfering with her daily routine. Other than the rudeness from the baseball cap wearing female, I felt goods about this place. The chicken strips were great. I got 5 in medium sauce and 5 plain along with a ranch and spicy ranch. The 5 tossed in the sauce were better overall bur if if you want plain strips i wouldn't hesitate. Also, there are some funny quotes on the wall. I look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu.",

Acting like we were trying to steal food, when they were the ones who offered. They talked back to us..argued with us, just all around acted terrible. They finally said they'd replace a small portion of the terrible old chicken they sold us. We said never mind.  My sister didn't think the food would be safe for her kids, that they might do something to it, because the people acted so underhanded and trashy.

I had some of the best chicken strips I've ever tasted. Their grilled chicken sandwich was similarly tasty. The choices of sauce are add nice variety and flavor. Further, the portions are generous.  However, the Chicken Shack's strength is also the major weakness. The focus is on chicken such that there aren't many non-chicken selections. There is salad and burgers, but it seems to defeat the purpose of going to a chicken specialty restaurant.  Take home point: if you're craving delicious chicken, this is a good place to satisfy that hunger.",

    "text": "This review is purely based off of the fact I just made a large order for my office and got nothing but attitude from the woman taking my order. My office orders lunch on several occasions from small local businesses like this one and I have never witnessed someone be so annoyed that we haven't finished our large order yet. The state that broke the camels back was our final co-workers order was preceded with the exclaimed comment of \"oh my gosh ok, is that the last one\". Prior to that, a side note during our order was that if we have a large order, to call ahead of time. Believe me when I say that if I didn't work for a busy office and that the last thing we had to think about two hours before lunch was what and where we were going to eat, we would have. We got to our order for a burger, where she then continued to largely exhale and tell us how small her grill was (we had 45 pieces of grilled chicken on it already and she told us it would take at least 30 minutes) and that now it would take even longer. As if being there and ordering food for at least 10 people wasn't bad enough, we sure as hell weren't going to waste anybody else's time by cancelling a burger order because you warned us of how inadequate your cooking equipment was. I'm sure I could continue with every eye roll and every interruption during our order from this woman, but to make matters worse, yes - I was standing there so long that my sandals were stuck to their disgustingly sticky floor and I could have potentially cracked my ankle. I hope they're glad that I do NOT recommend anyone bragging to a group of people to eat here or else you'll be greeted with frustration. This experience lacked enjoy ability as much for us as I'm sure for her.",

These wings are huge and they give a generous amount of fries.  I recommend getting the 3 fingers and 3 wings combo, way worth it, the fingers are huge pieces of juicy breast meat.  They also have an AYCE special going on all day everyday for $11.95 ($1 dollar cheaper than chicken bonz).  I still have yet to try it.  They also have $1 drafts!  As for the inside, it's small and it's maintained pretty well, they got two TV's hanging on the wall, two arcade machines and limited seating on the inside, but there's a couple tables on the outside too.  Overall, flavor and quantity is what Chicken Shack has.  That's really all you need for a good place to eat right?",

    "text": "I went here ever so eager. My eyes went wide at the menu - so many possibilities and so many sauces to try.  I opted for the standard wings. And went with trying 4 of the sauces - hot, damn hot, chili lime, and habanero honey. Blue cheese and ranch for dipping. Also ordered fries with fry sauce and potato salad.  The wings themselves are nice and plump. Very good quality. And the wings are actually breaded, which can be hard to do well. But the breading was nice and crisp and had a good flavor. So all is good with the actual wings.  The sauces, though, are lacking. The hot was actually more like a mild. Zero heat and little flavor. The chili lime was similar. I could barely tell it was chili lime there was so little flavor. The habanero honey also had zero heat and was too sweet. The damn hot, however, was fabulous. It had heat and flavor, but wasn't hot just for the sake of being hot. So, with the exception of the damn hot (which is the hottest on their menu), if you don't like heat or lots of flavor in your wing sauce, this might be the place for you. This is where they lose major points. The sauce is the most crucial part of the wings.  The blue cheese and ranch were ok, but not great. They didn't add anything to the wings. They're just sorta there.  The fries are really good. They are shoestring fries that are crispy and non-greasy. The fry sauce was just average. They do also offer chili cheese fries.  The potato salad was edible. And that's pretty much the best I can say about it.  Good service. Props for the $1 drafts and all you can eat wings.  Overall, if they could just get some better wing sauces (or my taste buds suddenly deteriorate), I might be back.",

    "text": "Nice little joint you guys got here tucked away in a plaza off of East Sunset Road.  I ordered the number 1 combination which consists of 6 Wings, Fries, and a Drink for 8.29 plus tax. I chose chipotle honey barbeque sauce for the wings which has a nice combination of sweet and spicy. The wings themselves has a slight breading on it which gives it more of a crunch to its crispiness.  As for the fries, SHOESTRING! I dont think I have had shoestring fries that good in a long time. If anything, I would go out on a limb and say it was even better than the wings! I can only fantasize how good their chili cheese fries might be.   They also have chicken strips, burgers, and a salad with your choice of grilled or fried chicken.   Now for the downers. Their prices are bit high for your basic chicken wings. The biggest thing I think that doesnt make sense is that they dont serve you any sauces with your wings like ranch, blue cheese, etc. Of course you can have your choice of dipping sauce but only if you wanna pay extra. Also if you want veggies like celery or carrots, that is also a separate charge. WHAT? When you think of wings, you see a plate or basket full of wings, fries, veggies and dipping sauce. That right there is perfection. I can think of many other places that give you dipping sauces and veggies included with your meal or at least free when you ask for it.   With everything mentioned, mostly good and a little bit of bad, this warrants 4 stars. To the owners, if you are reading this, a little bit of sauce and veggies goes a long way.",

Large, meaty wings in great sauces, with surprisingly tasty shoestring fries- and I don't even like the shoestring cut! Service was also surprisingly friendly and prompt, so don't let the location and exterior fool you.  The #4 combo is the way to go for a little of everything: 3 wings, 3 strips, fries, a drink (fountain), and toss in bleu cheese or ranch for just under fifty cents extra. Your total is under $10 and it's enough to stuff you to the gills or share (though for dinner I'd add on an extra 6-piece).  Habanero honey and jamaican jerk are really tasty sauces- as my BF said, I'd buy these bottled if they were available! The bleu cheese dressing tastes homemade, which makes paying extra for it a little less annoying.  Wish they had more than one location- I think they'd do well on the West side (hint, hint).",

People writing reviews about \"omg best chicken ever!\" are probably comparing it to McDonalds chicken nuggets. The tenders are fairly dry and the wings are not much better. Their BBQ sauce is actually pretty decent but the other ones I've had (ranch and bleu cheese) are bad.   The crux of my review is the customer service. A bad experience will sour my entire meal, no matter how good the food is. I feel like the owners have an ongoing contest to see how rudely their cashier can treat their customers while still staying in business. Every single time I come in I get the stink eye and get attitude from the cashiers. I mostly ignore it because my mom loves to get the food here so I bring her here, but after the way I was treated today I will absolutely not be coming back.",

    "text": "Now this establishment takes the award for best customer service of the day. When you come here you get such a homey feeling where you can just relax and eat good food.   Like it's name suggests the Chicken Shack specializes in Chicken; Chicken Sanwiches, Chicken wings, Chicken Fingers, Chicken Everythang!!   My friend Anthony and I had the honor of trying the \"6 piece chicken fingers with medium sauce\" and the \"chicken sandwich\" both of which were cooked to the point of perfection. The meat was so tender that it would literally melt in your mouth.   And while we were enjoying our meal the cook had overheard that it was our first time at the establishment, so he brought out a sample side of wings with 2 of their different flavors of sauces!! Honey Jabanero and Sweet Chilli, which completely topped off out whole eating experience!  As we finished our meal we noticed how much like family they treated all of their customers. While calling regulars by their names and with greetings like \"Aye!!!\" But what really caught my attention was their willingness to help one of their customers who had a fairly large to go order, out to their car. That's something that's not at all necessary but it's nice to know that they would go that far for their customers.   Overall my experience here was 5 stars for their amazing overall vibe. We'll be back Chicken Shack!",

Well that was a mistake as the young man behind the counter said NO....I could buy a bottle of water because too many people are taking soda instead of water. Did he just say I was going to steal soda????? Ok well on that note I replied I bought a soda but I'd like a cup of water for my medication....again a resounding no. Even if the chicken was great WHICH IT IS NOT I would NEVER step foot back in this filthy place again. Keep your dirty restaurant, poor service and water!!",

The fries are like shoestring fries seasoned lightly and you get a big portion of them with your combo.  The wings are just as large I ordered the 3 fingers and 3wings a great way to try them both.  Better choices of types of sauce too but the best way is plain with sauce on the side  Come Hungry and Enjoy!",

Chicken Shack is a small restaurant in the Smith's and Barley's Casino-anchored Shopping center that has masses of people shocking to the southeast corner of Sunset and Mountain Vista. The two times that I have shocked here in the mid afternoon, the place was packed. Today, I barely landed a table when a couple left. I came close to having to take it out to Ethal. M Cactus Gardens for an impromptu picnic. The reason that Chicken Shack is so popular is that they serve quality food at prices that won't burden the wallet in an upbeat environment.     It is funny that many of the hole in the  places that I have dined in are the most fun places to dine in. Chicken Shack is a quintessential example. Adorning the walls are humorous quotes related to chicken jokes, the Chicken Shack mascot that reminds me of a yellow version of Foghorn Leghorn, and license plates from all over. Supposedly every state licence plate is represented on these walls. Here is an example of one of the humorous quotes on the walls of Chicken Shack:      \"In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the road and that was good enough.\"  Grandpa    What is not a joke is the food. And plenty of food! On both of my visits I'd order a combo. The combo includes shoestring fries and a Pepsi fountain beverage. In response to the previous Yelpers stating that the shoestring fries were good, I say \"Ditto.\"     On Friday, July 9; I ordered six chicken wings dipped in a hot garlic honey sauce. The price of the meal was $9.95. If I opted for one of the sundry dipping sauces, I'd pay an additional 50 cents. After taking my $ and name, they brought the food to my table a few minutes later. Sharing the table with the chicken wings combo was a roll of paper towels. They were necessary. These chicken wings were the stickiest finger food that I remember eating in a long time. This might go down as the stickiest finger food or thing that I reviewed on Yelp. I got extraordinary use out of the paper towels. With that said, Chicken Shack chicken wings and texting is a bad combination. When I got past the consistent reaching back and forth to the paper towels, the chicken wings were all right. They were loaded with  white meat and flavor.     Today, I ordered the chicken sandwich combo for $6.99. They gave me a choice between crispy and grilled. I chose grilled. It was worth the long wait. This leads into me recommending passing over Chicken Shack if your in a hurry. This isn't a fast food joint where the chicken is sitting under a lamp. When the chicken sandwich arrived, I was like, \"Wow.\" The sandwich was stuffed with three mutant chicken fingers, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes next to a large portion of shoestring fries. Two of the pictures below show the giant sandwich. It is safe to say that I did not leave hungry.      In the future I conceive visiting Chicken Shack to put their chicken fingers to the test. Ideally this will be at their Boulder City location after hiking. In the present I give Chicken Shack my 4 star stamp of approval.",

I expected the food to take a little longer to be prepared than Canes, but it was actually brought out to me extremely fast.  Not only is the food great, the service is excellent. I had Eddie as a cashier and he was very friendly and helpful. He brought the food to our table and even came by to check up on us and asked how everything was knowing it was our first time there! He was kind and courteous to even the children in the restaurant no matter how busy it got! That guy would be an excellent waiter.  I will definitely be returning to chicken shack for the tasty chicken fingers, bomb sauces, and friendly employees.  ALSO I LOVE THEIR CRISPY SHOE STRONG FRENCH FRIES!!! I prefer these to crinkle cut fries any day!",

I've tried a few of their items on the menu.  The chicken tenders are very juicy and come in larger portions. Sometimes they'll even give one extra chicken tender with your meal. The fries....don't get me started. I. love. chicken. shack. fries. Sometimes they can be on the salty side, but they are the thin, shoestring kind and they are always perfectly crispy!! I'll admit...I've gone just for the fries before...(Don't judge me). Don't forget to ask them to toss your chicken in your selected sauce, or else it will come on the side. I've tried about half of their sauces available and all are yummy. You can't go wrong with which ever sauce you choose. I usually get the buffalo and ranch. Their ranch is so good. I've also had their salad for a healthier alternative with grilled chicken. Its not bad for healthy...but if you're going there you might as well indulge and get the fried stuff!  Definitely my go to spot if I'm craving some chicken tenders!",

We like it so much that we forget to try and order the wings. There are so many sauce I could recommend. Number one recommendation is definitely the Creamy Garlic Parmesean. My favorite is Habanero Honey. If you want a real change of flavor, try either the Jamaican Jerk or the Chile Lime. Staffs are always friendly. There are seating outside. Next visit we'll try that Fried Twinkies.",

The honey mustard also still tasted like it was made in a laboratory and was not meant to be consumed. What are you guys using to make this stuff?!  The chicken is oily and heavy on the breading. Choose fingers over wings. If you're looking for wings go elsewhere. The fries are shoestring fries and they're pretty good if you get lucky. If you're unlucky, they'll be overfried and you'll regret eating them. The sauces for the chicken are all free, the other sauces, such as fry sauce, are 39 cents.",

I don't know why but it cracked me up every time.  It seems pretty dumb now LOL   Went on Friday 3-11-16 at noon for lunch.  This restaurant is located on Mountain Vista & Sunset in the Smith's shopping center.  The place was totally packed!!  Seems to be a popular spot for lunch.   It's kinda small inside but they do have some outdoor seating.    $16.51 got us a 6-wing basket with a drink and a chicken sandwich basket with a drink. It came out super fast!    Their chicken is crunchy on the outside although a bit bland but they have some tasty sauces for dipping to make up for that.  The wings were full of raw, yellow, fat which I HATE but not so much that I wouldn't eat them again.    Their fries are the skinny shoe-string type and were hot and crunchy.  Their soft drink machine must be calibrated perfectly because their mountain dew is pretty much the best I've ever had.   Overall a solid place to have lunch and not too hard on the wallet.  Their ranch is out-of-this-world AMAZEBALLS.",

Overly salty and greasy for me - but the chicken seemed very good quality, and the portions were large.  Tiny place. No ambiance to speak of - other than a wall of \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" jokes. (some of which were actually pretty cute - but it wears off quickly).   Because of the limited menu, this probably won't be a regular stop for me. But if I'm craving wings or fingers, this is definitely the place.",

I was placing an order to go, the counter to order is in the back, there is a 4 top on the left & the soda dispenser on the right. I have an 18 month old & had her with me. So trying to not have her grabbing or hitting the people at the table & not play with the soda machine left VERY LITTLE room. I was in the way of staff coming from the back to hand out orders & for people trying to get refills. We finally get to the counter & I asked a few questions making it obvious it was my 1st visit. I place an order for 24 lemon pepper wings & a garlic Parmesan fingers meal. I pay & turn around to go wait & there's nowhere to go. They was 3 people in line behind me 2 other people waiting for their to go orders & 2 people trying to get refills. SO CROWDED. I finally get out of the way & go to wait at a 2 top, the only open table. My order didn't take to long. I get home w it & unpack it & there was no sauce for anything, wings, fingers or fries. I'm assuming now it's something you order as well. That would've been nice to know.   Now the food itself, it was very good. The chicken was cooked to perfection & the fries were great. We will go back but try different flavored, the lemon pepper was good, garlic Parmesan needs more garlic & Parmesan. We'll also be sure to ask for sauces!",

    "text": "This is my go to place for Chicken wings in Las Vegas!  It took me a while to find a great wing place, as sadly Vegas does not have many, but when I found this place I was hooked!   First and foremost they have sweet tea!  For me this is a big win as I grew up in the south and sweet tea is the House Wine for any southerner.  And yes there is a major difference between making sweet tea and taking a sugar packet and adding it to unsweetened tea! hahahaha  The quality of it can very.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is not. But hey I am in Vegas so I cant be too picky lol  As far the chicken wings they are HUGE!  Much larger then a normal wing.  Not sure where they get the chicken from but the chickens must have a weight room and spent the day bulking up.  The wings are pretty tasty and fried well.  6 wings here is definitely a good size meal.    The sauces vary in good to OK.  After trying a multitude of them I have settled on the Hot BBQ and the Hot Teriyaki.  I like the heat that both provide along with the balanced taste of the BBQ Sauce and Teriyaki sauce.   I am not a huge fan of the Lemon Pepper as it can tend to be on the really salty side along with being a dry rub.  The past couple of times I have been they have added new flavors.  This is always nice to see as it shows they are experimenting with new things.  I always make it a point to try the newest ones.  They can usually be found on the chalk board next to the register.   The fingers are also really good and they have meals that are reasonably priced.  They come with fries and a drink!  The fires are also a plus as they are on the thinner side.  I would recommend trying the fry sauce with them.    The decor is all based on the joke why did the chicken cross the road.  If you dine in or are waiting for your food they are pretty entertaining to read.  They also have some TVs and a little outside seating.  Overall it is a small space so not a ton of seating.    I would call there style of wings pretty standard, nothing fancy, just wings fried and served tossed in pretty typical choices.  If you have never been I would give it a whirl as it is much better then most of the places that sell wings here in Vegas.",

The spicy ranch sauce whoever made that up deserves a raise.   Check it out.",

The counter attendants are extremely nice and courteous, even when it's busy.   While True, sometimes the some of tenders can be a little dry, it's not something that ruins the meal and everything else far outweighs this issue. Highly recommend.",

My favorite sauce Is this sweet chili. I ask for it on the side, because I like to dip it. The fries are shoe string, but a much better quality than fast food joints. It's crunchy but still has a good amount of potato innards. The main problem I see about the chicken shack is how so many people come, dine in, and go that the workers have no time to clean. They are too busy cooking abd taking orders. Therefore, crumbs are everywhere, no clean tables, and trash cans get filled. I recommend then for take out. If you dine in, you could actually wipe your table using Pattie towels and their fountain water.   Anyways, the pros outweigh the cleanliness con. Go try it!",

I am the kind of person that tries to eat things I wouldn't normally cook, and chicken strips is one of those  things on my \"don't buy it if you can cook it\" foods.  I gave in to my hubby's begging to try this place one day after work.  We drove from the southwest to Henderson just for these strips, and I told him, \"these better be awesome for the trip.\"  Fortunately, he was right--the strips are awesome.  They are huge (I'm wondering what size these chickens are) and juicy.  Their coating is great and the sauces are wonderful.  I love their shoestring fries, but I was honed in to those strips and downed three on my own.  I even gave the wings a try, and they are quite tasty.    Overall, a great place to stop for some chicken.  I will drive down to Henderson just for these strips despite a closer competitor.  They're awesome.",

    "text": "A young Rex...a young taught schoolboy Rex...was once a star athlete. I was good at all of the sports the other boys wished they were. I was great at shooting dice, 3 Card Monty, pick pocketing and loan sharking. I was the envy of my entire 3rd grade class. Very few kids that age can play the shell game on a street corner for 8 hours and then kneecap some deadbeat over a 20 dollar debt at night.  I was a machine...a well oiled, tight bodied machine. The girls...oh the girls...nap time was a special time. A young Rex surrounded by his prepubescent harem.  It was magical. I was on top of the world.  My aunt Eunice would see me come back with some old man's pension check, because he owed 3 weeks of the vig after betting on the Giants, she would beam with pride.  We would go to our special place...and then he would take me for food. I deserved it...believe me. She would buy me fried chicken. I loved it. It washed out the taste of low tide. Bribe sweet bribe. Bribed my silence.  As an older man I look back on those days and still cringe. Sure the money was good. Sure the chicken was good. The rest...not so much.  I tell this tale of woe and want for one reason...all of that great chicken was almost blotted out of existence from a combination of court ordered therapy, LSD, electroshock, and Kenny G Therapy...my own creation...not for the week of heart.  I discuss it in detail in \"Kenny G: How the Devil Gave Us Therapy.\"  Those great chicken dinners would be lost to the recesses of my mind...just flickering images...like the ones I see of me standing on top of a building, naked, wearing a beer hat and smoking a cigar...images of meaningful nonsense. That was until I went to the Chicken Shack. Oh, sweet Chicken Shack. Let me hold you. Let me kiss you. Let me call you aunt...wait...never mind.  Chicken Shack does what it does...and it does it amazingly! Chicken Shack chicken is never frozen. The breasts and the wings are huge...like Busty Dusty big. Ah, memories...I almost suffocated at a club in Pittsburgh once.   The 5 strip lunch/dinner is more than enough for the biggest eater.  It comes with fries and a drink for under 8 bucks.  Fountain drink for unlimited soda. I saw these two huge fat guys mowing down a 5 piece. They looked full. They looked content. They looked like they had hypertension. God Bless America. The wings are excellent but I recommend the strips. More meat. Tender. Juicy. Delicious. Same price.   The sauces. The sauces are key to a place like this. Like having weed on you when trying to sleep with Jennifer Aniston. Mandatory.  Well, Chicken Shack doesn't disappoint. Recently I had the special Habenero Honey. It was sweet. It was hot. It hurt a little bit after 4 pieces. It hurt the good way...like being dumped by Amanda Peet...that body can only keep you happy for a long time...then you are just praying for a stroke.  The BBQ sauce is excellent. The Garlic Parmesan sauce is absolutely amazing. The chili lime isn't very good, sorry. Too limey...like Hugh Grant.   If chicken isn't your thing...then you think that Rex will tear into you for going to THE CHICKEN SHACK...but no...not at all...they have a burger there that is amazing. A single. A double. A triple. You can add cheese and bacon. Yes...triple cheese and bacon.  Oh is it good...it's really good. I ate it. I cried. I ate it again. I cried harder. I threw a chair out the window. I ran.   They have an all you can eat chicken wing and 1 dollar beers. If that doesn't sound good to you then you are a loser. I say that with no hesitation. No remorse. No second guessing. You are the type of person who would hold up a bank but leave the stuff in the safe.  The atmosphere is great. They have funny slogans on the wall. Cute. Sickeningly cute. Rex is sarcastic. Rex hates it. Others will love it.  The bottom line is that this is obviously a family place run by people who actually care. Rex is very happy to find a local business that prides itself on quality and building an ongoing local relationship with customers. Nice owners. Great food. Local. Cheap. Quality.   When Rex dies please batter and deep fry him. He deserves the honor. Take a bite. Take a big bite. You love the way hate tastes.",

    "text": "My youngest son loves chicken wings.  Actually the whole family does.  We discovered this gem of a eatery via Yelp and visit every time we are in Vegas.  Even if we are not staying very close by.  Why?  Because the wings are plump, juicy and delicious. We had the sweet chile, honey bbq, teriyaki and buffalo medium.  Everytime we have been here, John was behind the counter and taking care of us.   Very friendly and patient and has great suggestions.  It is obvious from the steady flow of patrons that the wings are delicious.  We also had the shoestring fries and coleslaw.  Coleslaw was ice cold and kind of sweet but definitely great.  And the fries disappeared almost as fast as the wings.  I wasn't sure the 36 wings would feed the five of us but the wings are so big that we left full.  No leftovers.  My only comment would be that the orders had a much higher percentage of drummettes than wing sections.  I prefer the wing but I am guessing John could make that happen for me next time.  Worth the trip and forget about the decor.  The chicken is the draw here.",

For about $6.00, you can get fries, 3 chicken strips, and a soda - Combination #3 on the menu...they also have beer (on tap) for around a $1.00, but the selection is limited. Both times I've been, the place has been packed with people. It's a small space, but I've always been able to snag a table. I like when a restaurant has some personality, and this place is anything but boring! The staff is friendly, the patrons are lively, and the walls are covered in funny phrases that reference chickens...on top of that, the service is usually pretty quick.  Okay, now for the food. The star here is the chicken. It's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...it's surprising that with no bone they are able to keep the chicken so tender and juicy, but somehow they manage to do it. I should mention, too, that these are NOT little chicken strips...they are plump pieces of all white meat (their chicken is the antithesis to McDonald's ha ha). Every time, my friend thinks that he needs the 5 piece, and although he finishes them, he always says it was too much food! Everyone is different, but the 3 piece combo has always been plenty for me. I get the Habanero Honey BBQ sauce on the side, and also order a side of blue cheese. One of my pet peeves at restaurants is when they nickle and dime you, and here the blue cheese/ranch/extra sauce is an extra $0.49/$0.35...I'd rather them just factor that cost into my food. The fries are good, but after eating my chicken, I find that it is salt overload...  The reason I come here is for the chicken. They execute it well, and they're consistent. If you're craving some fried chicken, skip KFC and check this place out!",

As we walked in most of the dining area had the chairs on top if the table tops and an employee was sweeping the room. I find this so annoying as they aren't supposed to close for another half hour. When I ordered the guy behind the counter seemed like he wished we hadn't walked in. He turns and asks the cook if the fryer is \"still on\". Why wouldn't it be on?  You don't close for another 30 minutes. We sit at one of the few remaining tables to wait for our food. When my order comes up they call my name and say \"Aaron! Togo!\"  Umm, no I didn't order it togo, but we can take your rude hint and we leave. I work in the restaurant industry and I know that your closing time means that's when you stop taking orders or seating people. Sorry if you had big plans for a Friday night but I had plans too. Plans to get some delicious fried chicken wings and fingers and hang out with my girl. We left very disappointed on our first and LAST experience at Chicken Shack, and not due to the food though which was very good. But there are too many great spots in town where we can get good food AND at least decent service.",

WingStop back in Cali was my favorite go to spot for crispy well seasoned wings, but I have yet to find a place out here in Henderson near home that can compare. I ordered the #4 which comes with 3 boneless wings and 3 regular wings all in the Lemon Pepper flavor. The fries are pretty tasty - well seasoned super thin shoe string fries, but the wings were too much on the salty side compared to what I'm used to getting with WingStop's lemon pepper wings. Plus, as one Yelper pointed out, they keep their back door open, which you can clearly see from the ordering counter.  That somewhat worries me, for obvious health hazard reasons.... The place is real small, untidy and not as inviting as some describe it to be. It was an okay visit, but I'd rather go elsewhere - even contemplating just sucking it up and travelling across town to get my WingStop fix.",

Coleslaw was bland nothing to rave about. The fries were good, string fries. The tables were not clean. The hot sauce and ketchup bottle was crusty. The workers looked high from smoking weed.

I never like to review a place after one visit anymore, so I gave it a couple chances. Fail fail fail.   To succeed in business, you need great customer service. This place does not have it. After reading on their website that they close at 9pm, I get in my car around 7:45pm to travel 11 miles to this place. I arrive around 8:15pm. It's a family of four head of me in line. The guy behind the register is preparing some take out orders and never acknowledged them. They had enough with the waiting, and the lady says she's ready to order. His response? \"Oh we're closed\". What the hell are you talking about you're closed? He says \"we close at 8:30 and its 8:31\". I couldn't believe what I was seeing or hearing! If the customer is inside before those doors are locked? You're still open for them!!! The lady and her family angrily walk out, and I do the same. What made me even more mad??? I get to my car and see that it's only 8:24pm!!! The boy was straight up lying to our faces!!!  I told myself that I was done with that place, but because of such high remarks on yelp, I wanted to try the food. Decided to go back the weekend after, early in the day, so I can see if the hype was real. Ordered 3 wings, 3 tenders and fries. Back in college, I worked for KFC... So I know exactly what old fryer oil looks like when used on chicken, and what it smells like. Old oil (reused or not changed) will make your chicken darker, and make it taste funny. This was the case with Chicken Shack. Absolutely nasty. Fries were soggy and lacking taste. It was so bad that it prompted me to go online to find out who owns this place. Whoever you are...we need to speak.   You served me a trash worthy product. Get it together. Will not return.",

The service was friendly and the customers were as well.   For the price you pay, you get a whole lot.We had the chicken fingers, with 2 large sides and 4 drinks. It was enough to satisfy our hunger. Everything we ordered was yummy, esp the bbq baked beans. If we're ever in the area again, we're definitely going to stop by again to try something new!",

We walked in there and the place was disgusting. Chicken bones, straw wrappers, utensils, fries, sticky floors, the soda machine was gross, the tables etc etc..it was so bad we walked out and went somewhere else. On top of all of this, their health card wasn't posted anywhere. I know it's a bunch of young high school kids working there, but come on.",

Hubby and I tried the medium sauce wings.  The wings are a nice size, super juicy, perfect amount of breading/crunch. Also the sauce was PERFECT!!! Only issue was No dipping sauce was included with our to-go order (perhaps you are supposed to tell them you want some; we were never even asked if we wanted any) Normally I'd detract a star for something like this. But the wings were so good that it honestly wasn't a huge deal not having anything to dip them in.  This is def my new wing spot!!! Cant wait to try their tenders :)",

Better quality chicken than wing stop or b-dubs, not better sauces. Similar concept, but more mom and pop style instead of chain food. To me you can taste the freshness, which made up for the \"just so-so\" garlic parm flavor. Also tried spicy teriyaki and I expected more spice. The spicy ranch however was AMAZING. I think their dips are up to par if not better than the rest. I upped it to 4 also because I haven't tried all the sauces yet, and I will for sure return based on quality N service.  Another good local Hendo spot! Check!",

If it had been my 1 st time, I'm sure I also would have been bothered by it. The staff is comprised of high school kids who are most likely looking to go home, or go somewhere else besides work so it really doesn't bother me that much.   As for the food at The Chicken Shack it is  good. My coworkers are always pushing Canes on me, but bang for Buck The Chicken Shack kills Canes. The fingers are plump and juicy with a light breading that is not overwhelming. The sauces are diverse and tasty. Sweet chili and Habenjero Honey are my two favorites. The fry sauce is a perk for the crisp Shoe string fries. The chicken wings are fantastic as well. Very large and meaty so you get your money's worth.   It is a weekly, or at least bi-weekly regular foe me and my wife. .",

    "text": "Today was my first time at the Chicken Shack. I went to the new location in Boulder City, NV. The building used to be an old Sonic. It was their grand opening today so the lot was super packed, not a single open spot to park. I parked at the o'reillys and walked over to pick up my phone ahead order. Parking was my only issue, but it may be different when it settles from the excitement, so I won't count that against them.  The aroma was amazing and you can hear them frying up that crispy deliciousness. The establishment was clean and has a few indoor tables as well as outdoor seating. When I got there to pick up my order the line was a good 10 deep. I eventually asked one of the gals if my order was the one on the counter. She started to prepare it for me, but the owner or manager (not sure which, could be both) asked if it would be alright for them to fry mine up fresh since those boxes were sitting for about 30 min.  I had come at the right time (20 min estimated) but they must have finished it up ahead of time. There will be a learning curve for pick up orders so it wasn't a big deal to me. She wanted to make sure my stuff was fresh though so I waited another 5 min, paid for my order and was on my way. I really appreciated her thoroughness and effort in ensuring a quality meal...and they did not disappoint.  The chicken was so tender with just enough crunch on the outside. Super tastey and the portions are huge. We ordered large bc we expected small chicken tenders. These were massive. I could only eat 2 (kiddie size for me next time lol). We chose multiple dipping sauces (I got 4 free with my 20pc order and 2 lg fries...each additional was around 40 cents): Chipotle bbq, regular bbq, hot, sweet chili, honey mustard and of course fry sauce. They were all so good and they are quite large...looked like a 2oz plastic ramekin vs the small 1oz you get everywhere else so that's a plus. The fry sauce had a kick! Loved the skinny \"shoe string\" style fries also. The large is an entire togo box full at about $4.19 I think. Needless to say, after feeding 4 people, I brought home an entire box of tenders AND another full box of the fries to my kids.  They offer a deal 20pc tender (or 25 pc wing) 2 lg sides and 4 drinks for like $34.99 but I didn't need the drinks, so I just ordered my 20 pc and fries separate.   We will go again sometime. It was great. :)",

    "text": "Before the movies today, my work team decided to have some lunch at the chicken shack.  I've heard some good things about their chicken so I was excited!  When you get there, you'll notice two picnic tables outside for additional seating.  I don't know if the tables are constantly cleaned, but it looked sticky and dusty.  When you get inside, there are tables on both sides of the restaurant:  two tops, four tops and 6 top tables. The inside seemed the same type of cleanliness as the outside tables.  Just looked sticky and a little dirty.  It looks like a small place, however, they seem to be efficient.  A lot of people were there but we fortunately got a few tables fast.  The staff was really nice, a guy and a girl in the front.  They were really busy but kept professional and nice.    For the food, we literally got about 150 pieces of chicken:  100 wings and 50 chicken tenders and a bunch of fries for about $150.  We got a lot of different flavors and sauces on the chicken.  Mild and medium heat chicken wings/tenders, lemon pepper wings and my favorite, garlic Parmesan wings.  The wings are super crispy and juicy inside.  I ate a bunch of wings and they were all cooked perfectly.  The garlic Parmesan really had a lot of flavor and no overly salty.  ON POINT!!!  The lemon pepper flavor wasn't overpowering and managed to still shine through.  I REALLY liked the chicken.  Definitely would recommend the food to someone else!  All in all, we ordered way too many wings for our group of people today.  We literally ended up wasting a bunch of wings because we were going to the movies right after and didn't want to leave the food in the car during the movies.  Aside from that, I was definitely a happy customer and think the wings were great!  Will be back for more :)",

Their food is always on point and quick, their service is good and their staff are friendly, and they are pretty quick and (usually) give you an extra wing. I have gone so many times I've lost count, and will continue to go as long as I live here and even once I've moved away whenever I come to visit.",

I am sure others might disagree but this place has fresh chicken made to order and also they give you good size portions, they are skimpy on the chicken either they are good sized pieces. This location get busy a lot but its totally worth the wait. They staff is also very friendly and nice to offer items to complete your order in case if one forgets to add something.  Also the time to get your food doesn't take long, so your not waiting a long time. You will always see people coming and going to get take orders, makes it look really busy which is it. I want to try their other location but haven't yet. The chicken is always cooked done and juicy.  Try them I'm sure you wont be disappointed.",

    "text": "Their fries are pretty good and you get a ton of them with your combo, but the chicken is mediocre. Some of their sauces are really good and creative. The chili lime is probably my favorite. The lemon pepper rub was pretty good, but nothing to fan-girl over. But, a lot of their sauces are so-so and in my opinion, are just there so their list of sauces is longer. I got the 'hot honey garlic' thinking I was going to get a sweet and spicy sauce that tasted like garlic because it was in the name, but it tasted like regular bbq sauce. I could see flakes that could have been garlic or chili flakes but it tasted like straight up bbq sauce so I thought they gave me the wrong sauce. I went back and the guy working informed me that the hot honey garlic sauce IS bbq sauce and it is only called hot because they mix the 'damn hot' sauce in it. I don't know about you, but if a sauce is called 'hot honey garlic' I would at the very least expect it to be spicy and have the slightest hint of garlic in it. Or, that if a sauce was a bbq sauce, maybe specify that it is bbq sauce. Bbq is such a strong, specific flavor. It is also one that I hate, so maybe it wouldn't hurt to put bbq in the name so people who are unfamiliar with the sauces and are just trying out a chicken shack sauce for the first time may be able to choose a sauce they would find satisfying. But what do I know right? I'm just someone complaining on yelp. All in all, chicken shack is pretty good, but not my favorite. I think raising cane's in comparison has juicier chicken but chicken shack's chicken is crunchier, although it is also way saltier. Chicken shack definitely gives you more/bigger food, but like I said, their sauces are meh for a place that seems to be all about the sauce options. It would be awesome if they could make a hot honey garlic sauce that was actually that and not bbq. But I will say, when you pay for extra dipping sauce or ranch it comes in a container that is quite big so I mean that's kind of cool but I'm still not a fan and don't really get the hype.",

But after I paid, they offered me a water cup while I wait, and told me I can get any fountain drink I wanted! How nice of them  If you order a side of ranch or any sauce their sauce cups are huge so it's easy to dip the wings and portion is a lot too.   I'll be back to dine in soon, especially they have cheap beer too :)",

My experience there was \"ehhhh.\"  Girlfriend ordered the fried chicken with fries. I got their triple patty burger and fries. We both got drinks with the meal.   First off, the Dr. Pepper machine was not working. Strike 1.   The guy taking my order asked how I wanted my burger cooked, I said medium rare. It came out well done and dryer than moses' nose in the desert. Strike 2.   There was no strike 3 from myself, but girlfriend did not like the chicken and was less than pleased with the meal. She said the chicken was dry and flavorless. With a simple meal like fried chicken, I imagine its hard to screw that up but it happened.   Perhaps I'll give them another chance in the future and maybe we caught them on a bad night. If that's the case, I'll update the review at a later date.",

Ordered the 5 piece finger combo. While the chicken itself was moist the batter was so salty, I couldn't eat more than 2 fingers. The fries were nice and thin & crunchy but were also so overly salty that only a few could be eaten.  It's not just the chicken either. My lunch date ordered a burger which also was so salty he could only manage to eat 1/2 the burger!!  Lastly, the side of coleslaw we ordered to share was partially frozen so it also went mostly uneaten.  All in all, even though the ambience is cool, I will NEVER go back!",

    "text": "Thinking about wings to hang with my son and instead of Buffalo Wild Wings, we to Chicken Shack based on yelp review from Bethany E.  She gave it a five star and I am glad we tried it!  a.  Location - In a funky odd strip mall near to the great Ross J Aloha Grill!  Plenty of parking and space.  This is a very small place that can seat perhaps 30 people approximately.  b.  The fare - Here you can get hamburger, chicken strips, chili and the famous chicken wings.  You can buy by quantity or in combos.  We decided the 25 piece for 22.89 and also the fries.   c.  The taste - Nice and plump wings with a crispy textured coating. Very nice. Not greasy or anything, just right. The sauces come in a variety of flavors that are given to you free based on the quantity you order.   d.  The extras - If you want something like ranch or blue cheese, this will cost you like .39c per small cup.  Odd, but okay.  The veggies of carrots and celery cost you and is considered a side.  They have small and large side portions including macaroni salad and potato salad.  I am sure there were other things I am missing here as I was focused on the wings.  e.  Speaking of wings - Further to my comments, I did like the wings, however, the ratio of drum sticks to the wing portion was about 3-1 and I prefer the wing portion with the two bones.  f.  A following - When we walked in, we were the only people here. After five minutes, the place was packed!  I say, check this place out. It is not bad at all and for the good ole wing craving, this is a well priced and tasty place.",

So I didn't expect much other than another chicken place.  Was I mistaken.   First thing that caught my eyes were all the various quotes and license plates all over the walls, NICE.  Even saw a license plate from Hawaii that started with a 'K'. I'm 100% sure that a 'K' means it's from Kauai, my home.  They most have known I was coming LOL.  They have 2 flat screen TVs and two arcade games, PAC-MAN and Marvel Super Heros vs Street Fighter.  There wasn't anyone there when I arrived around 2-3pm.  But I just missed the rush, as I was waiting for my food it started to pick up and it was filled.  I ordered the #4 which was 3 wings, 3 fingers, fries and drink for $7.95. LOVED IT.  The wings were good, cant really mess that up.  But the fingers were AWESOME must have been a rhino's fingers, they were plumped, crispy and crunch on the outside, and juicy on the inside. The fries were different, it was prepared like how you would fry calamari and salty but really good, not your regular salt combination.  Something that I've been doing lately and recommend is having the sauce on the side.  My sauce of choice this time was the Hot Teriyaki sauce which was a perfect complement to the saltiness.  I left full but really wanted more.   After talking to one of the worker I found out that Chicken Shack or at least this location has been open for 8 years already. I wished I found this place earlier, especially now that I don't live in the area, this would have been my regular eats.  They have a HH special which is actually all day everyday, its 12 wings, bucket of beers, and a basket of fries for $16. Which might be a good deal.  They also make burgers, sandwiches, and a fried or grilled chicken salad. I'll be back soon definitely.",

I enjoyed the \"chicken\" sayings that were painted on the walls throughout the shop.  Definitely good for a laugh while waiting for your food.   The shop certainly wasn't clean as a whistle.  But the service was nothing to complain about.    I didn't enjoy my chicken fingers.  Breading was not as crispy as I prefer and the finger itself was just... eh.  I did enjoy the shoestring fries.    It's not exactly the same but while I was there I just kept thinking, \"If a Raising Cane's were closer I would have just gone there.\"    I'd go again and try more stuff but it probably won't come to mind over other lunch joints.",

They gave me 4 instead of 3, not a complaint there. The chicken is delicious and the fingers are huge portions, they are huge, the fries were ok, very thin but still fries lol. I ate two and was full. Regardless I shared the rest with boyfriend, he liked them too, the sauces are great, lots of variety for sauces, you can pick two with any combo and they are bigger cups. Definitely enough ssauce for your meal. I would say, worth it!",

Got it with the chicken tenders that were just as good. I got the mild sauce so I wasn't too happy because it was kinda spicy for me but i'm a wimp so it's ok but still was good. I loved their shoe string fries too! My bf had the hamburger and he loved it as well. The prices were reasonable. Only downside is that the place is small but other than that I'll come back to try the different sauces!",

Not what I really expected, first of all the the chicken the star of the dish was way over cooked, like it was cooked yesterday and just flashed cooked today, the chicken was tough and chewy.  The buffalo sauce was good and potato salad was very flavorful.  The bottom line chicken was over cooked, chewy and tasted old, possibly freezer burned.  I have them three stars because the last time it was much more fresher then this body, so next time will decide if we ever come back.",

    "text": "This is a good place to go if you are craving for some chicken and fries. It does get busy and the seats can filled up quickly, leaving you no place to sit and eat.   I normally get the 3 piece chicken tender combo. It comes with fries and a drink. You get to choose one of many flavors sauce they have. You can opt to have it on the chicken or on the side for dipping. I normally get the Jamaican jerk. This time I went with honey habanero. It was more sweet than spicy and didn't have any kick at all. The chicken is moist, cooked well, and has a nice crispy outer layer. The fries here are good! They normally give you more than what you order (I got 4 tenders), but that probably depends on the size of each piece.   The service was okay. The person who helped me seem more interested in her phone than working. She must've looked at her phone at least 5 times while taking my order. After ordering, she asked if I wanted blue cheese or ranch. Not knowing that they charge and thinking it came with it by how she ask me, I went with ranch.   Overall, food is good for chicken and fries. Service could be better and it wasn't even busy when I went. I'll probably come here again.... ONLY if I'm not willing to drive far.",

I thought that perhaps I had a sensitive stomach but judging from other reviews there seems to be an ongoing problem with this restaurant.",

From previous Yelp pictures, the crispy-crunchy skin looked delish and with my random craving of chicken wings, I decided to give this place a try!   This location is on the smaller size with maybe 6-7 tables and two tables outside. They have some super friendly staff; When I walked in I was greeted with a smile and a \"Welcome In.\" It was the same guy who took my order at the register- again super nice and gave great recommendations on which sauces to try.   Within less than 10 minutes my order was walked out to me and I was on my way... upon first crunch, I knew I was going to really enjoy these wings. That golden glow was mesmerizing and after trying both the Honey Habanero and Damn it's Hot- I knew I was going to be a fan of The Chicken Shack! They serve up some good wings here! I got my wings dry so that I can really feel the crunch of the skin. Plus this way you can control how much sauce you want.   I would definitely return for some more wings in the future and I would recommend this place for friends to try.",

Not a big deal, but worth mentioning on this forum. Well Abdul wanted to know what store, what time, but was never concerned about correcting my disappointing visit- just what employee to address.

We both knew it was a fail. I got the number 4 - wings, fingers and fries. Wings were breaded which is a crime against humanity. Sauce was ok, but the fingers were dry and overcooked. I ate one wing and one finger and tossed it all. Waste of time and money.  Such a let down. Fries were good. I don't see myself coming back.

Hot was standard buffalo sauce, lemon pepper was TOO salty and the habanero honey was great (not too sweet with a slight kick at the end).  The hot and habanero honey were sauces but the lemon pepper was a dry rub.  I like my wings and fingers crunchy so next time I will ask for sauce/dry rub on the side.  Chicken was not dry and the portion size was good.  The only negative thing was the cashier made a mistake on my order.  He offered to correct my order, but I would have to pay the difference.  No thanks, it was your mistake buddy.  Overall, the food was good and I liked the decor.  I don't expect mistakes to be made all the time so I think 3 stars is fair but my True rating would be 3.5 stars.",

My favorites are the honey habanero, Hot, spicy teriyaki and sweet chili.   Shoe string fries are addictive, how do they make them so good ?!? Dip them in their crack sauce, I mean honey mustard and OMG. I literally have to throw them away to stop eating them. Their coleslaw is also really good.   So why 4 stars?  They charge you for sauce ?! I have never had wings that don't come with Blue cheese ( ranch for the west coasters) on the side. It's annoying is all it is.  No celery and carrots either?! This you also have to pay for. We always pay extra for these things because you're eating wings and these items are necessities. For the cost you would think it would be built into the price.   I would come here more often if it wasn't for the things mentioned above. Other than that, you won't be dissaointed.",

I suggest either an early or a late lunch.  This place gets busy!  And rightfully so I might add.  I ordered up five tenders and fries with a sweet tea.  Some tenders were coated with habanero honey and some were dusted with the garlic parmesan seasoning.  For dipping I chose both ranch and bleu cheese.  Fully expecting the habanero to hurt me, it did not and was not overpowering but offering a very nice spicy/sweet taste.  I did not notice the parmagarlic rub to much.  No matter, the chicken was moist and tasty.   FYI...They serve beer.",

    "text": "This was my first time eating here tonight! I read other reviews that complained about the size of the place, and it is small, but it's called My Chicken Shack, not My Chicken Palace. The name suits the size.   It was busy when I went tonight, but not too cramped and they definitely had a good amount of tables for groups to sit at. I waited maybe 5 minutes in line before I ordered; they had only one register from what I could see. There were a lot funny phrases playing with the \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" question all around on the walls though that entertained me while I waited to order.   When I reached the counter, the worker was friendly and provided recommendations of popular sauces to have for my wings. There are definitely a lot of options to suit everyone's preference. I ended up ordering 6 of his recommended Honey BBQ and 6 of my personal choice of Medium. The Honey BBQ was good! I could have done without the Medium though, it was whatever.   I ordered the 10 piece chicken fingers with Chipotle BBQ sauce for my boyfriend and was asked if this order was for one person. When I said yes, I was warned about the size of the chicken fingers and that it might be too much for just one person. I decided to stick with it but.. damn, he was right! Those things are huge!!! I thought the fingers were better than the wings too, honestly.   They only have one size option for drinks too, and it's probably the equivalent to most places' small size. I didn't dine in but it looked like you could have unlimited refills, at least.   I had high expectations for this place considering how busy it always looks from the outside. I'm not sure these expectations were met, though. It was good - don't get me wrong - but I was expecting it to be the most amazing chicken I have ever had and I think my hopes were a bit too high.   Rating is really a 3.5 but giving them the benefit of a 4. I would go back, but only now and then.",

The chicken is slightly salted for flavor and I'm not sure if I could pick up on any seasoning, but the chicken is delicious nonetheless.  You have the option of getting a combination of chicken fingers, chicken wings, and/or fries. They had a wide array of dipping sauces, all of which are good when paired with the chicken and fries. I either get the 10 piece chicken fingers for $12.29 or the 5 piece chicken fingers, fries, and drink for $8.99. I usually get the habanero honey and honey mustard sauces. I've heard the garlic parmesan and lemon pepper are good sauces too.  The service is quick and there is not wait staff, so you have to get everything yourself if your forget it at the counter.  It's a very straightforward and simple restaurant, just chicken and fries, nothing else. If you're looking for a good chicken, check out Chicken Shack!",

But this is an older hole in the wall with a reputation of good chicken. They have cheap beer and a tv playing the game for people who are into that. Definetly  making the trip out here to eat.

The only downside of this place is if visiting right before they close, they run out of some options and it just never tastes as good - the rest of the day is spot on.",

I liked their hole-in-the-wall location and atmosphere. It seems very little has changed since my last visit. Their place is located in an older strip mall. When I got there it was about 7:00 pm and the place was busy but not crowded. I ordered the five piece chicken strips along with the creamy parmesan and I believe it was the hot honey garlic sauce, both on the side. One side of sauce was enough, actually, to handle all five strips. Shoestring fries and fountain drink completed my order. The chicken strips I received were cooked to a darker golden brown (which made the outside more crunchy) but the chicken itself was tender and juicy, and hot off the fryer. I needed to wait a couple minutes by eating the fries first. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Although *I* have had no issues, I would side with a few other reviewers and recommend coming during their peak hours. Yes, it will be busier but I also believe this is when they cook and serve their best food. I would be cautious of coming in close to closing time because orders may be cooked inconsistently.",

    "text": "Ok, first off, the food is great! The chicken wings were really good, the sauce is tasty, and the fries are CRAZY GOOD! My only complaint is with the service.  They advertise being open until 9pm. My wife and I showed up October 31st @ 5:50pm and were told that they were closing in 10 minutes, so we would have to eat outside.  We agreed to this and then proceeded to watch multiple people get turned away, even though the open light was still on and the door was unlocked.  We could hear the employees talking about some Halloween party that they were wanting to go to, and it made us wonder if they were really supposed to be closing early, or if they were just taking advantage of the boss being away.  There was a sign on the door that asked patrons not to wear masks inside the store for Halloween which made us believe even more that this was not something that the owners were aware of. We sat outside for about an hour and watched numerous groups get turned away because the \"fryer was already turned off\" as the cashier would tell people, and then proceed to take the orders groups of 1 or 2. One lady who was turned away, was pretty upset, and she was talking to her husband, complaining about them supposedly closing, but saying that she overheard the people in the back talking about their Halloween party. Then another group that was turned away, said that they thought it was ridiculous that they were closing @ 6:30pm. I overheard them and said, \"That's funny, they told us 6!\" Another group was turned away shortly thereafter being told that the fryer was already turned off. Not 2 minutes later, a man and his wife walked in, ordered their food, and continued to eat their meal, inside. Some people were forced to eat in their cars, because there was no room @ the tables outside, and the staff kept telling people that they had to leave. The cashier came to the door as we were eating, and started to peel the sign off of the door, notifying customer about their mask policy. He looked over at me and said, \"I probably should lock the door huh?\" I said, \"Probably, unless you want more angry customers than you've already had so far tonight.\" My wife asked him if the owners were aware of their early closing, which he skirted the question by saying that it was a family run business that closes early for holidays, like Thanks Giving and Halloween.  I told him that this was the first business I've ever heard of that closes early for Halloween and he just kind of nervously chuckled and said, \"Yeah\" and then I told him that it might not be a bad Idea to turn off the Open sign, or put up a sign notifying customers of their change in business hours. My guess is that this was just a bunch of idiots, thinking that they were pulling a fast one, by coming up with a \"genius\" plan to close up shop early, so they could get to a partly. I know that I won't be going back, the next time I am in Vegas.",

Didn't think it'd keep up with a name change since it was so known with the bonz, but they never missed a beat!   Pros: 11$ and under for any combo (8$ for the 3 finger)           Friendly environment and nice wall decor           Good customer service!

I often try different sauces on the menu, but my favorite, so far, has been the Hot BBQ.   Try this place if you're looking for great chicken fingers, wings, or a chicken sandwich. They also have burgers, but I haven't tried one yet.   The prices are so reasonable that it's hard to believe. The portions are larger than the price one pays.",

Love the feeling of eating at a sports bar without the smoke or rude customers.  The only thing I dislike is the size.

I tried the BBQ, Habanero Honey, and Garlic Parmesean. I think the Habanero Honey stood out the most and it's probably my favorite flavor there. I also got a side of cole slaw which tasted like KFC's (which I personally like). I also got a side of fries but it wasn't memorable and it didn't enhance the meal. Hence, I would probably opt out. As much as I like getting a bang for the buck, the unnatural plumpness of the chicken was bit disturbing. Though, I enjoyed the meal the breading was a little bit too thick. If they would refine the breading, I'd give them 3.5 stars for great price and the Habanero Honey flavor.",

Their chicken tenders are the best I've had in Henderson, and their skinny fries are the perfectly crispy complement to the tenders. The best part of eating here is the occasional 4th tender they give you when you order a 3-piece meal. They have great sauces, and one of my favorite requests is to have the tenders thrown in medium sauce. For the days when you need a somewhat healthier meal, their grilled chicken salad is filling and somewhat satisfying. The only issue with eating at chicken shack is the limited seating.",

    "text": "Rothman S.'s review is so accurate!   I went to this place based on the recommendation of a co-worker and I prefer to support independents.    It's noon/lunch hour and I can not imagine placing a less welcoming person at the register/order station. NOT A HINT of a smile came across that woman's face and the entire time she was taking my order she had her blue eyes starring out the window. NO LIE; I looked behind me to see what was in the parking lot that was so damn captivating.  I must admit she did make eye contact one time; when I handed her my twenty bucks.    There was no one tending/cleaning the empty tables, so if you came after me; enjoy the crumbs & spilled sauce!   I have an idea, put Ms. Personality on busboy duty and allow customers to yell their order to the cook in the kitchen!  She'd be less appalling and the next customer wouldn't have stains on the elbows of their long sleeve shirt!   I end this by stating my opinion about the food because that's all that really matters, right?  Simply; the chicken was consistent with the service.  F",

The fries were disgusting, oily and cold.  We also purchased wings and those were nasty as well. Don't do what I did and believed people that this place was so great and then expect great, because you will want to slap yourself for believing this. People are easily impressed with anything they don't cook. Maybe that's the problem, they should cook.   Don't waste your money. To top it off it is pretty expensive for the quality of food. Don't do it.  Unless you like wasting money.  :)",

    "text": "Called ahead and ordered to go around 7:30pm. Once driving, I opened the box to grab some fries and noticed order was missing 2 tenders (5 pc order), & so i circled back to get rest of order. *not a huge deal, but definitely inconvenient*  The big issue here is that upon opening the lid of the box there immediately was a very foul and overbearing smell which reeked of rubber/old dirty oil. I mentioned this to the staff and was told, \"it's fried so its going to smell and taste like oil\". I left, as I was in a hurry and figured once I dunk it in hot sauce and ranch it wouldn't be bad.   While driving, I took a bite and dipped the chicken into the buffalo sauce yet had the worse taste of butt/oil in my mouth.  After looking at them in the light closer, the chicken fingers were drenched and coated with a greasy/slime residue of oil and very soggy. The fries, unfortunately, were exactly the same and tasted like pure oil. I immediately lost my appetite. After only having a few bites of a chicken tender and a few fries my stomach soon after began to reject the food and  I had to pull over and puke.   I have eaten here several other times and the quality of food and way of which it was prepared has never been an issue. Not sure if maybe they had new cooks, if they hadn't cleaned out fryer properly (using old dirty oil), or if they just got lazy due to being later in night. Regardless, this should never of been an issue and it was a waste of my time, money, and messed my stomach up for the night.  I hate that I wrote a review only after having a bad experience as I've enjoyed chicken shack before, and for that reason alone I will give a 2 star rating. However, after eating/throwing up what was clearly food that was not prepared correctly and not suitable to eat, I doubt I will ever return here again or reccomend this establishment going foward.  Side note: good prices on beer and good location.",

I got a chicken mozzarella wrap with the cucumber salad.  $10 w/o a drink.  Wrap was actually very good, cucumber salad was a bowl of cucumbers with straight, potent apple cider vinegar poured on it.  Way to strong a vinegar flavor to be edible.    My wife got a chicken Caesar wrap with Mac and cheese. Wasn't very impressed.    Friends that met us here got a chicken meal with mashed potatoes.  Chicken wasn't bad, potatoes weren't impressive.   Drink dispenser sprays soda all over your wrist.    Brought the wrong order to our table and weren't very friendly when we brought it back to them.  They replaced it, but didn't really say sorry or anything or even speak to us about it. They looked mad at their staff, took the wrong stuff away and didn't say anything.  I stood there for a bit and then told them, \"I guess I'll go sit back down and wait for it.\" and they didn't reply.   Simply, it wasn't overly impressive for $40.  Won't be returning",

Well, finally decided to go in an check it out on a Monday night around 8pm. A couple TV's with some sports on. They serve beer. OK, I'm beginning to understand the appeal. Wings, chicken strips, burgers, chicken sandwiches, fries, and a few other sides. Simple menu.  I got a 12 wing pack, creamy garlic parmesan and Damn Hot! split. $11.99 or a dollar a wing. Wings are big, so decent enough pricing. At a glance I thought the sides prices were a bit high, but I didn't see the quantity served.   I wasn't overwhelmed with the creamy garlic parmesan wings, I have had better at dive bars. Not bad, just not great. My friend said the Damn Hot! wings weren't that hot. I didn't try them so no comment.  Its an ok place, mostly frequented by younger people. I'll probably stop by again sometime but I wouldn't go out of my way. Usually I bbq my own wings. 3 stars fits the bill.",

Good place to get a party platter from - I think the chicken would be awesome in a wrap.",

I hope this was just a one time issue because my son loves this place and would like to return. I appreciate fast service but if that doesn't mean my wings are cooked to order than I don't mind waiting longer to have good fresh food.",

The fingers are perfectly HOT when they come out and the inside remain juicy while they are nice and crispy on the outside.   The variety of sauces really makes it so I don't get sick of the place. You can always find a new combo.   On days I don't feel like fries with them, they happily sub a different side.   And, to warm the dark cackles of my heart, they offer both ranch AND blue cheese as dipping sauce.  No, the staff isn't the most warm and fuzzy and happy group. But this isn't  a Guy Savoy fine dining experience-all I care about is getting my fingers fast, hot, and crispy. And that they do.",

By far, the best fried chicken (both wings and strips) I've had.  Tried a couple of other places and it just doesn't compare: the flavors, the texture, the size... Mmmmm-mmmm!!!! (smacking my lips)  What also gives it the edge are the shoestring french fry combination, it brings out that crunch that I had been looking for at the other chicken wings/strip spots.  The serving size is huge, I usually split a combo with a friend and that tends to be enough for me.  For those with larger appetites, don't worry, this place won't disappoint.  BIG Thumbs up!  The service is great, everyone there are friendly. Cute little spot that gets busy with a diverse crowd of patrons. The only complaint I have is during the times I've dined in, I can't help but notice how dirty the place is (the walls are friggin' gross as it's covered with dust and grease). As much as I enjoy the food when I dine there, the walls can be distracting.  Other than that, this place has great food (5 stars) and great service (5 stars)... just wish it was a bit more tidy (3.0). Overall, 4.3 stars in my book",

I would give it five stars if it was a five star type of place, but this is as good as it gets in dining like this! Next time I am going to try the extra hot as I like things very spicy, and the normal hot wasn't super hot. Also the hone habanero isn't very spicy but is sweet and spicy and very good. Also the garlic parmesan is outstanding, but in wings I do like spicy.",

I ordered a five strip meal with fries and selected spicy blue cheese and honey habanero sauce on the side. Few minutes later, my both mine and my friends food came out rather quickly with a clean and concise presentation. Eating the food, I can tell that they use quality products and they pay attention to detail with cooking. Nothing was skimped on and the sizes of everything were proportionate. I found myself really enjoying the food, however my eyes were bigger than my stomach.

    "text": "I would give this place a 5 star review if they didn't use Postmates as their delivery service. I was able to make ONE single successful order though postmates but since that order, my cart will not clear. Because of that, I cannot make another order for delivery. I have tried emailing postmates a few times now and even called them. Each time, they give me the same useless solution. Uninstall/reinstall the app or click \"edit\". It still won't allow me to place another order. If Chicken Shack began delivering or changed their delivery service like EAT24 or BiteSquad,  which work flawlessly, I won't be able to eat there as often as I would like. This is the only negative. Their food is amazing and I wish I could have it delivered.... :-(",

    "text": "Great Quality Chicken Strips!!! They have a great selection of dipping sauces that can be drizzled over top or on the side for dipping. The batter is light and salty and the chicken is 100% breast meat. Very tender. The prices are reasonable and there is a sauce for everyone. For an alternative to \"Fast Food\" that is a bit more healthy than the chain stores give Chicken Shack a try. I prefer them to Canes.  We were told the name change occurred when the original Chicken Bonz owners wanted to increase margin with frozen chicken and lower cost recipes and preparation.   Regardless of the name Chicken Shack is a solid pick for some Good Fried Chicken in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Very tasting wings, I prefer them to the tenders because to me, the wings have more flavor. I also like that the wings are breaded then fried so they are extra crunchy. I recommend avoid going in within 30 minutes or even an hour of closing. We got there a little after 7, got our food after 7:30, and were still chowing down around 8. The guys working there though were putting the chairs up the second customers leave the table. I understand there's a lot of prep work and cleaning they have to do after closing, but it made me feel like I needed to hurry up and get out of there. It also doesn't create a very welcoming atmosphere for customers who are coming in to eat.",

We used to get just the grilled chicken fingers as we try ro be health conscious, but the breading they use is very light and males the fingers come out delicious, the insides are moist and tender and break apart able to dip in their  multitude of fantastic sauces. Add on a giant beer for only $3 and this meal can't be beat!",

    "text": "This place was a good little eatery that offered a variety of items from chicken fingers, chicken wings, burgers, chili, etc. Of course we came to try to chicken fingers since that's what all the hype was about. Tried it slathered in hot sauce, which was good flavor... but seemed to be just like Frank's Red Hot sauce just not as spicy. The chicken was  dry, but still okay covered in sauce. I was pleased to have shoestring fries! They also offer a variety of other sauces either on the side or on your chicken. Next time I think we'll opt for on the side. Of course they offer the usual fixings of ranch, blue cheese, etc for dipping as well. This place can get busy though! We beat the crowd, but shortly after many people were looking for  table to sit at. Decent place to check out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Picked the wrong day to come try this place!!!!! Called in my order for myself and a co-worker and specifically asked for sauce on the sides. Drove about 6 miles to pick up and of course the orders were incorrect. The girl who was working the register at 12:10 pm was rude, arrogant and had a HUGE attitude when I told her the orders were wrong. She started to have MORE of an attitude when I asked for the manager and she said \" anyways with you\" which I thought was beyond disrespectful. A male chef came out and tried telling me that I didn't order what I said I did over the phone but yet I spoke to a female on the phone to place my order...how does that make any sense?? The male chef asked me what I ordered and I told him, he then went back to the kitchen and fixed my order. By the time my order was fixed I had already lost 23 minutes into my 45 min lunch break from work!! I will NEVER go back to this disrespectful place of business. On top of it all they screwed me out of a chicken finger when I ordered a 3 piece they only gave me 2 fingers and shorted out on the fries !!!!! This place sucks !!!!!!!",
