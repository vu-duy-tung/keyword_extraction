    "text": "OK, I'm going with 3 stars just because service is of the utmost import to me. The service was super inattentive despite the fact that there were myriad servers on the floor at all times.   An empty sake cup is the ULTIMATE sushi dining foul! Grr!  This place has been given rave reviews from all of my friends, so I had to try it for myself.  It's VERY American meaning large portions and  lots of American ingredients.   They did have this incredible roll called the Something Wrong #35. Oh, there was something oh-so right about this something wrong. The tempura yams and carrots we very unique, and this was my hands down favorite.   I fell in love with \"japanese lasagna\" at Osaka, but Sushi Fever's version didn't give the dish its due.  The cool thing about this restaurant is the clever naming of the rolls (really?! Dale Earnheart --whoever that is with THAT spelling) has his own roll? Oh, and I think I'll try this one \"Just for the Halibut.\"   Punny. Corny. Still Fun.  But I digress...  This place was jumping for an early Sunday evening. The people didn't stop waltzing through the doors in their khaki shorts, t-shirts, and hiking shoes (c'mon people! Dress up for a change!). The fact that each customer was greeted with some foreign Japanese phrase (it probably means a$$hole for all I know because I stopped speaking Japanese in elementary school) was a unique  personal touch.  Next time I'll sit at the bar. At least I'll be entertained by the sushi chef while I wait for my sake cup to be refilled.  Give it a shot! ~L2",

I had the Monica roll which was delicious and a rainbow roll, albacore sushi and a cucumber and sashimi salad. All of it was delicious. The chef at the table was fantastic he did all the basic tricks, tossed cubes of broccoli at everyones face and kept s entertained the entire time. I love when you get to watch someone play with your food before you eat it, so all in all this place was pretty good.",

(And I've never once gotten sick like I did at one place that shall remain nameless...)  My favorites are the Joe Special, Japanese Burrito, Garlic Tuna, Gail Special, and Spicy Yellowtail. I also love their yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. My bro and I devour that one!  The Screaming O is a little fiesta in your mouf, but I'm not a huge fan of mayo and usually ask them to leave that out of the sauce (and any other sauce they put on my rolls).  You'll be pleasantly surprised by the bill, too. We ordered take-out tonight and it only cost $59 for 6 rolls. Yeehar!",

My personal favorites are the Mexican roll and the Dale Earnhardt roll.  Not quite sure why they equated Dale Earnhardt with soft shell crab, but it works.    It's a bit pricier than other sushi places around town, but it's less than what you'll find on the strip or in off-strip casinos, and the freshness and creativity are worth a few extra bucks.",

We have been coming here for quite a few years, since 2011. A man named Kim use to be a waiter there, we always asked for him. He was one of the best waiters we've ever had. They hire only the best.   We do not go anywhere else since we found this gem. Something about ally 1, Linda special, ex- girlfriend, TNT, nuclear roll, Tijuana, kiss of fire. J-roll are just some we have repeatedly enjoyed. Everything is delicious here. You can't go wrong! Besides that the service is fabulous!  Always faithful to our sushi fever!!",

Most of the rolls are unique, too. I haven't been anywhere else in the world that serves most of their roll.  I love their \"special\" sauce. You can serve me a seaweed with special sauce and I'd still eat it. I love their hot towels they serve you before you eat. And oh, that complimentary orange slice as a dessert. LOL   My favorite here is the Something Sexy #2. And the Screaming Orgasm! LOL",

Places like this can go either way in terms of food content, and I wanted to try a new place as I've been getting more rice than fish in my rolls.    Not here.  We tried a few of the specialty rolls and a sashimi platter.  The rolls were tasty, but the platter really stood out.  They pack their rolls with fish, and everything tasted really fresh, so you definitely get what you pay for.  The prices themselves aren't that bad, either, so you can get filled up pretty quickly for a reasonable price.  Big points for their sake.  It helped to make the already pleasant rolls that much more, well, pleasant.  The service was no slouch, either.  Attentive to the point of covering whatever was needed, by not constantly in your face or disruptive when you had a mouth full of food.  Everything was very laid back and casual, and the servers were helpful for new choices.  Bear in mind this was during a lunch, so I can't speak for any potential dinner rush.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience here, and I would gladly go back to explore their other options.  At the very least, we now have yet another sushi place to frequent.  I could think of worse things to have.",

I do wish the servers would actually call it by it's full name and not the screaming O.       As for the sushi, it really is all good.

    "text": "One of my favorite places in town!  The rolls are huge and I love the toppings. One roll will fill you up and I typically split two of my favorites and I'm a happy girl. The Monica roll has shrimp tempura & spicy soft shell crab, topped with tuna, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce & spicy ponzu. The Sexy #2 roll comes with fried onions and mushrooms on top and the Carrot Top roll has thinly fried carrot ribbons on top. Lots of fun stuff here!  This place doesn't do AYCE but like I said the rolls are massive and that makes it ok for me. Typically I'm a big AYCE fan but I can't get away from the flavors here. The restaurant itself is also really dated and the service is a hit and miss. But with all that said, I like the rolls so much that I keep coming back just for them.   The big rolls will run you between $12-17 each and the flavors are on point. You know it's good when you let certain things slide because the food is bomb!",

I first started ordering to-go and pressed my luck with the Ex-wife roll (ended up being my go-to a few times. I finally ended up eating at the bar and service is great! The sushi chefs if sitting at the bar are funny/quite talkative. The servers are attentive. Wet towel for you, cucumber dish and edamame to snack on while you order. I told them what I liked and they custom made a roll for me. Also, ordered Carrot Top and the carrots on are the perfect taste and touch to the dish! The Screaming Orgasm is great if you're looking to cut carbs from rice out. They even have pure veggie options instead of rice wraps. I feel like every dish alone is a perfect amount and filling, but the taste always has me ordering more!",

They aren't all you can eat...which is why I love it! The sushi is fresh! The sashimi cuts are huge! The main reason I come here - the Rolls! The rolls are huge and loaded with fish, not rice.  The Sushi Roll menu is extensive. They have so many rolls to choose from! Overwhelming! They have three menus of rolls! The rolls are fantastic!  * Only Bad part - they don't have any of the special rolls listed on the order sheet. You have to write down your order on a napkin. They should get this fixed   The Rolls:  Some of my Favorites  * Lamborghini * Ultimate Shrimp * TOP * Sushi Special #3 * Monkey Roll  Definitely a great place to go grab amazing sushi!",

Within the last 6 months we finally decided to step outside of the box and try nEw sushi restaurant.  We found one that was satisfying the first visit, so we went back a couple times before returning to our trusty Sushi Fever.  My hubby, kids and I came in for dinner on a week night last week.  There have been so many changes in the menu and unfortunately we don't like them. First off, PORTION size has diminished quite a bit!  Prices didn't follow suit with less food being served. Then they went and changed our favorite, the OMG roll.  It was terrible.   The snapper was so dry we left almost the whole roll to waste. For those reasons I took off 2 stars from where I would've rated them before the changes.",

Not might - I have had friends from all over the world who are sushi fanatics, don't expect much when I bring them and are BLOWN AWAY by the flavors.  Sure it's not the fanciest looking place.  On a busy, understaffed night things might take a little long (very rare) - but there is no better place. I've converted non-sushi eaters to sushi eaters.  A simple Ultimate Shrimp is a sure fire way to get them in the mix.  Then you can introduce the Monica Roll and expand.  My family's undecided favorite is the Monica Roll.  Your list of tasty tries follows:  Lamborghini (share this one) Something Wrong Roll #7 (spicy kick) Jay Roll (spicy no tempura) Naked Salmon (no rice and delicious salmon dish) Screaming Orgasm (tuna and radish treat) Apple Roll (non-rice pallet cleanser) Summerlin Special (tastier than expected) Rock and Roll (no rice and delicious) Kiss of Fire  Their Udon is delicious and for your non-sushi eaters they have a great xxxxxxx teriyaki and tempura combo that those that won't eat fish can enjoy.  Something for everyone and all around delicious.",

Once we were seated it took a while to have someone take our drink order and after that I told my son if they take much longer to come take our food order we are leaving. Someone came to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks and I asked if we could just order. Once the order was placed I admit they were very quick to bring out the food. The Steak Hibachi was mediocre. I also ordered spicy Tuna Roll and seaweed salad and my son ordered chicken teriyaki. No one came  to check on us, I had to get their attention when they were buzzing by our table. It would be a good spot to eat if you were wanting to get a quick sushi dinner and get in and out fast with no real interaction with your server.",

The large interior is filled with teppanyaki tables, a large U-shaped sushi bar, and a dining room. The quality of the food is average with rolls like the Hawaiian ($10.50) constructed with minimal rice and decent flavors from the tuna. The Don't Tell Mama ($16) was more visually impressive, but flavors were dominated by the overall spiciness of the chili sauce. For dessert, the deep fried cheesecake was disappointing. The center still frozen and the tempura batter covering the slice was uneven with some areas too thick and chewy.  2.5 Stars",

The only thing that I can say that was not much different were the 2 Japanese Lasagnes. I also ordered a James Bond and it was one of the worst stale tasting rolls I have had in years. I wanted to ask him if he had pre- made it or something. It tasted like the rolls you get from the supermarket deli section. I also ordered the FindomSarah which was not bad but not great. My son ordered another roll with salmon but it also was not up to par with the high standards I have set for this restaurant. The worst thing is although I didn't say anything at the time I was at the restaurant I have called to speak to the manager for the last 2 days and have not received a call back. I have read on other Yelp reviews that Sushi Fever is under new management which is probably the reason for such drastic change or maybe because it was a Sunday and not managed the same. I hope this was a fluke but will definitely stop coming here if no one even calls me back..",

If you're not in the mood for something spicy, the Nevada roll, is simple but delicious. All the ingredients they use are clean and fresh. It's always a pleasure to come here and take saki shots. Feel free to sit anywhere at the sushi bar, you're bound to have an enjoyable meal.",

Actually its one of the first things I start to get excited about when we start to plan a Vegas trip.   You must Must MUST try the Screaming Orgasm!   Its not cheap sushi... but you pay for what you get. The suchi chefs do not just slap these rolls together. The Apple Roll requires the sushi chef to peel and apple into a ribbon as it becomes the wrap for the roll! The Apple Roll is amazing, but I personally wouldn't order it when the chefs are busy... it requires way too much of their time. But if you are in there when its slow... my goodness its yummy.   Everytime I have gone Ive had amazing service. I always sit at the sushi bar and the chefs have always been extreemly nice and attentive. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.   Do yourself a favor, try Sushi Fever.",

The first thing I ordered was the screaming orgasm.   It was perfectly seared tuna over a bed of rice noodles.  The presentation was very appetizing and beautiful.  The second roll I ordered was the Something Sexy #1.  One of the best rolls I've ever had!  The dipping sauce for this roll was excellent.  The tuna was a vibrant red color and tasted fresh.   I would definitely rate this place a five star due to the wonderful quick service and the excellent food.  A very unique selection of sushi rolls.   The only thing I could find wrong with this place was when one of the waitresses sneezed in her hands behind the sushi bar and continued to serve food without washing her hands.",

We had the tuna sushi and like butter it was i mean melted in your mouth perfection that tuna was so fresh i almost wish it was still swimming it was so good but I'm glad it wasn't and a sliver was on my plate yummmm. The spicy edamame was delicious. We were fat and happy. It was seriously fantastic i would drive from los angeles once a week to eat here. Its a local place and i got a tip from a local to go. Its about a twenty minute drive from the strip but worth driving hours to go to. And we got the bill and damn not what i thought less then $200 for all of us with beers and sake , if we had this at one of the hotels on the strip we would have been out about $500 easy.",

    "text": "Sushi Fever certainly makes a strong, strong case for the \"Most Interesting Meal of My Life\".  I suppose that I should have entered my dinner with this expectation in mind, as I was already coming fresh off of the sensory stimulation-packed slambanggasms of the 2011 Electric Daisy Carnival. With this being said, my dining companions and I were looking forward to a relaxing, refreshing meal - the ideal contrast to three days' worth of dancing between the hours of 8 PM and 6 AM.   In a way, Sushi Fever certainly did accomplish just that. The sheer variety of the restaurant's offerings is simply staggering, as the five separate types of menus awaiting our party of six were accompanied by lists of the day's specials that were craftily placed under the glass surface of our table. Although it did take some time to decide between dozens of sushi varieties (and a nifty selection of entree items such as teriyaki, as well), I decided on a Crunch Roll (a reliable classic that has yet to disappoint me at any sushi bar) and a Honey Roll (I think that was what it was called, I know that it was the first item on one of the special rolls menus and that the roll was listed as being drizzled with eel sauce).   My fellow diners and I also ordered two orders of gyoza - one steamed and one fried. Each order consisted of six potstickers, so all six of us exhausted rave-slaves were able to sample the dual dishes' tender/crispy textures and refreshing meat/broth filling. The dishes also came with a nice bowl of edamame - just what my tired bones and seratonin-depleted brain were looking for! Healthy and refreshing.  NOTE: THIS ENDS THE PORTION OF THE REVIEW WHERE THE DINING EXPERIENCE CAN BE CONSIDERED \"NORMAL\". Thank you.  Upon finishing our appetizers, my friends and I expected to receive our entrees within roughly 5-10 minutes. Strangely enough, Sushi Fever seemed grounded in the practice of bringing our entrees out one by one. Poor Nick got his chicken teriyaki almost twenty minutes before any other entrees were served, and it must've been strange for him to nibble on the twin chicken breasts bit-by-bit as the rest of us suppressed our appetites. I sampled a bit of the miso salad that his teriyaki came with (the dish also comes with miso soup), and the salad was relatively tasty, but not anything to write home about.   Ryan was the next at our table to receive his dinner, and he too attempted to slow down his eating while waiting for the rest of our entrees to be served. The gap between the arrival of his entree and the arrival of the next two dishes was about ten minutes, and I did note that the restaurant appeared to be picking up in pace rapidly, as dinner customers were arriving in larger parties. Still, shouldn't establishments be prepared for stuff like this?  Nevertheless, my food finally arrived. The Crunch Roll had a somewhat strange presentation; it almost seemed as though the roll had been organized in a sort of jumbled fashion on the plate, and the sushi was positioned in a shallow plate of sweet sauce (not quite teriyaki sweet, but still sweet nonetheless).   Now inevitably, you're probably wondering how Sushi Fever earned three stars (or any stars at all), and this rating is due almost entirely to the INSANE FLAVOR OF THE SOOSH! For all of the restaurant's shortcomings, I cannot deny that my sixteen dollars certainly went far in the way of the food itself; funky presentation and Snorlax-esque service couldn't upset the fact that the Crunch Roll had an unforgettable contrast of texture and that the Honey Roll offered a mellow, rich, refreshing flavor that jolted the tastebuds in the same way that the Swedish House Mafia's drops jolted my eyes into the back of my head at around 1 AM on Sunday morning. Pure bliss. The portion size on the Honey Roll did leave a bit to be desired, however.  Our meal took a turn for Beyond Wonderland, however, once my friend Scott received his \"Chef's Special\". I'm not entirely sure as to what the roll's contents were, but the dish resembled a regular sushi roll with a transplanted hat of crabmeat glued to the top. Looks weren't deceiving on this day, as Scott took a bite of his sushi and promptly proceeded to gag, again and again (HAHAHA). He washed the piece of sushi down with some lemonade, and my friends and I decided to have a Man Vs. Food moment of our own by sampling the choke-inducing dish.  Oh my.  Strange stuff; I suppose that being Filipino really saved me today, as my companions each began to put on the most grotesque faces upon sampling the Chef's Special. My tongue, specifically, was greeted by relatively normal sushi flavors and an undesirable gut-punch of bitterness (not the sharp heat of wasabi, nor the unmistakable flavor of ginger, mind you, but some awful bitterness). Never again.   In any case, Sushi Fever was a hit-or-miss experience. Kinda like Russian Roulette. You just gotta know what to order.",

I would normally give it five stars however...  we were celebrating 10 years of being together and decided to come to sushi fever .. we had been to sushi fever two months prior and noticed the same behavior. Right when we sat down and we were beginning our experience, I noticed that one of the servers stacked a big pile of dollar bills in front of us to hint at us to tip them. We believe in tipping good service but this is kind of ridiculous. Thank you captain obvious ! The servers at the bar were very pushy and kept barging into our business, \"ruining the moment\" so to speak. Asking us what we wanted to order and didn't let us take our time... Felt very rushed! This was the first time tonight that I walked away really bothered with our experience. Never before have they been so irritating with trying to upsell roll after Roll and then pushing us to buy them a beer at the bar.. Am I mistaken to think that we should OFFER to purchase them a beer? Instead of being forced to buy it for them? The guy tried literally three times during our 45 minute experience. We won't be back for a while. This kind of behavior is unprofessional and Unacceptable. It does not lend itself to a relaxing, dining experience. :(",

I'll get to that soon)  Ok, this is not the cheapest sushi place around. No AYCE, and the rolls are fairly pricey.  But the rolls... Good gosh there are a lot of choices!! I counted 75!! That's seventy-five choices of sushi rolls!! How can people ever decide??  Well, decide we had to do.  I feel as though I decided pretty well, getting the Love Me Tender and the OMG rolls.  I was kind of cheating- both had cooked items in them rather than raw, but who cares.  They were both very, very tasty, but the Love Me Tender was my favorite. Both were full of fish, not rice, and came with their own sauces, so I didn't even need to mix up the soy and wasabi.    Now, service was the downside of Sushi Fever.  We sat at the bar, and it took a long time to get the chef's attention for our order.  A cucumber salad and edemame (sp) were brought quickly, and that's a good thing, because it took forever for our rolls to be ready.  It also took quite awhile for us to get someone to bring us the bill.  I wonder if things would have been quicker at a table?",

    "text": "I had one of my best experiences here. Not because of the food. To be honest, since my father is a chef -- I have high expectations when it comes to Fine Japanese cuisine and this spot does NOT do it right. My father trained the chef who trained the owner of this store and for that reason ... My mother and I ventured here when I was craving raw fish in Las Vegas.  To be fair, getting good sashimi and such in Vegas is quite a task. This place is local to my mother's home, and due to the familiarity of how this chef was trained, we decided to take a shot.  What made this experience so great was that my beau, who is completely allergic to fish, was ready to rumble in the ring -- to make me happy. His lips puffed up as he ate but he kept a smile on his face. My mother and I were both mutually impressed. And he made me happy ... Ok this is coming off wrong. I'm not happy that he's allergic, I was happy that he cared to make me happy... Whoa whoa whoa! Back to the food story:  Alright so service, not so good. It was slow, and the waitress forgot to give me my miso soup and cucumber set. When I asked her about it, she said \"Oh I didn't give you one?\" Clearly, lady... clearly... So she went to get me a set. Then she noticed that we had edamame on our table... To be real, oftentimes sushi restaurants hookup a small portion for free so we were nibbling on them waiting for our dish... Well well well, when the waitres noticed our edamame, she took it away, mentioned that we didn't \"order\" any, and gave it to another table!!! GROSS!! Hamachi kama was the best thing, but that's usually always safe.  The sashimi was OK. Not the freshest but the best I've had in Vegas. Not saying much. Amaebi was supposed to be live, but they added way too much wasabi and it was not tasty. Lost the sweet flavor for real.  Dynamite was frozen scallops and mushroom and rice... Not up to par AT ALL.  The best thing was the tempura ice cream, though we waited for a solid 20 minutes to get it.",

    "text": "I'm obsessed with this place, as you can probably tell by the number of checkins I have at Sushi Fever. I used to eat here almost every day when I would work out at City Athletic Club across the street.   The waitresses/waiters are really nice. A lot of them have what I order memorized which makes things easy since I can be a bit high maintenance when it comes to ordering my sushi. My favorite item to order here, hands down is the Apple Roll. It consists of salmon, tuna and yellowtail with avocado wrapped in green apple with a dot of Sriracha on each piece. I like it because there's no rice so it is the perfect low carb option for me. They serve the Apple Roll with spicy ponzu sauce with cut up scallions in it. The sauce goes perfectly with the tart taste of the green apple. So delish and refreshing in the summer time! I crave these often and am pretty much hooked on this place as a result. Be forewarned it takes a bit longer for them to make this because of them having to cut the apple, but it is well worth the wait. I'd suggest to order a few other items so that you have something to tide you over in the meantime.  The Garlic Tuna and Ultimate Shrimp roll are also really good and both are worthy of a mention.",

(My favorite place to sit) I was greeted immediately, given my plate with ginger and wasabi, some edamame, and a cucumber salad. All free!!! That was such a great surprise! I ordered the sashimi 10 piece platter. The fish was all fresh and delicious. (Salmon is my favorite and it was like butter, yummy) Then I ordered a \"Oops\" roll. It had salmon, tuna, crab salad, shrimp, deep fried jalapenos, and spicy mayo. (I believe that was all that was in it) It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! Full of flavor, and no rice! What a great option.  The menu was spectacular! They really organized it into great categories that really made it easy to order. Usually at sushi restaurants, it take me FOREVER to decide because I have to read all of them and sift through all of them. At Sushi Fever, they organize it by tempura, rolls without rice, etc.  The sushi chef was super nice, friendly, fast, and easy to talk to.  I am SUPER excited to have found a GREAT sushi place! I will be coming back soon!",

When you walk in you can chose to sit at a table or the sushi bar and they also have hibachi grills. My boo and I picked the sushi bar since we just were grabbing a couple rolls.  Once seated our waitress immediately took our drink order and brought our complimentary cucumber salad. The salad was lightly dressed with a refreshing taste. We then placed our order for a regular spicy tuna roll and jackpot roll and were given some complimentary edamame. It was very fresh and delicious. Just when we thought we were already in love with this place our rolls came out. The spicy tuna was on point. It was not too spicy and came with a little side of sriracha. The jackpot was definitely my favorite though. I couldn't get enough of the ponzo it was plated on and the shrimp and avocado were spot on. Even after our meal we were offered oranges for dessert, above and beyond service!   This place honestly kills it on service and food. I'm so happy to find a new spot so close to my neighborhood.",

They always accommodate our large family and service is top notch. Very friendly and willing to meet all or our requests with a smile.

    "text": "Sushi Fever has become my new go-to sushi spot. The dine-in experience is superior to just grabbing takeout, as the attentive service and photo-worthy presentation make these tasty rolls even better.  You can't go wrong with any of the special rolls on the back page of the menu- the #2 and the #3 in particular are good choices because they come with a large, great roll topped with a seafood salad, so it's like getting a free app with your roll. Other favorites include the Carrot Top (topped with fried, shredded carrots), the Something Sexy #2 (topped with grilled mushrooms and onions), and the Linda Special (topped with grilled peppers and onions)... in addition to tons of toppings, these rolls usually all come with their own dipping sauce. Authentic Japanese sushi this is not, but the rolls are great nonetheless.   The best rolls here will set you back $14-17, but they're large portions (usually 8-10 pieces) and packed with fish and ingredients rather than rice. Sashimi is good here too, served with fresh lemon, radish, and shiso leaf, and cut nice and thick.  I've found the service is best when eating at the sushi bar. You get a cucumber salad and edamame upon being seated, then place your orders and get fresh orange slices to finish. Chefs are attentive about taking and pacing orders, and friendly without being intrusive. I find myself willingly spending more and ordering less by opting to eat here instead of one of the many AYCE places around town.",

A few flaws is that depending on who is making lunch for you the preparation can be inconsistent and lacking in one way or the other. One time at 10:30 PM right before closing (11pm) our waitress suddenly dropped off the check on the table. Never asked if we would like dessert and quickly ran off. Oh well its just their way of getting you out of there. The food is very good and restaurant often very busy. 4 solid Yelp stars",

Everything was so very fresh -- For Vegas, that is a BIG deal. It's definitely worth the drive, if you do not live in this neighborhood. Don't bringing friends who are put off by sushi -- there is pretty much nothing else on the menu -- This is a real sushi joint and you gotta try it.  And in response to Nikki B from a few comments below: WHO the heck goes to a restaurant 40 minutes before they close and then act that way? As someone who has been in hospitality for over a decade I loathe people who talk smack because they don't know how to be a respectful patron, who bust into a place After a kitchen starts closing down and find every reason to complain. Even the finest restaurant would not seat you, at least be happy about that. This place is awesome, trying coming at a reasonable hour.",

Now while my sushi was of course fabulous, the service SUCKED ASS, I feel I should mention the prices as well are WAY over what they should be!  I am a sushi addict and don't mind paying good money for the sushi, but this place is just overcharging on all accounts.

Their fish is always fresh and their food is always on point. They also have their own sauces made in house which really sets them apart from other places. I have had quite a few of their rolls, but my favorite is the carrot top. They deep fry some carrots as a topping which is a great addition because of the flavor and texture. They put lots of sauce surrounding the roll but it never bothers me because it is delicious to dip the roll and the fried carrots in it. My mouth is watering as in writing this review lol but really though, I could eat at this place everyday because it's that damn good.",

I asked for water and said I would like to see the menu. There were several menus with different meals and options but only one of each for a party of 4 I requested more menus and never  got them. Asked for a house Merlot which was $4.50 on the menu. The manager came over and said we don't have that anymore and I asked what is the least expensive wine and she said $8 I was not happy about that. Then she said that she would look and see if they have the house Merlot. She said she had the last bottle and proceeded to pour a very small glass - less than half full. Others at the table ordered hot food. Chicken and salmon teriyaki very ordinary and the salad on the menu never came. . Chicken katsu was dry as a bone. Spicy pork dish very good but came out only when we wondered where it was and asked about it. I ordered special #4 which I thought were 2 hand rolls for $12.  A nice hand roll came out and I asked where the other one was and they said no- just one. All at table agreed that they thought there were 2 hand rolls as described on the menu.   I would suggest JJanga or Kona Grill instead. I really felt hustled both by the wine situation and the way the # 4 special was described. As well as the fact that the noise level was very loud and service very disjointed. It seems that they are successful and no longer feel they have to give value or service. I see no reason to go back there.",

They have a lot of things going for them: good fish, open late, friendly service, and some really great rolls. I would suggest sitting at the sushi bar- it's a very pleasant experience between the sushi chefs and the other diners, who tend to be a friendly crowd. However, they have a split restaurant of sorts, one side with the sushi bar and tables, and the other with Teppanyaki. I generally prefer the sushi side, but I have gone with groups for Teppanyaki and it was also a good experience (consistently good food, great service, and not too loud), so if you're a big Teppanyaki fan, they do that well too! One of the difficulties in finding sushi in Vegas is the tendency of restaurants on the strip to charge exorbitant prices for mediocre fish- Sushi Fever charges reasonable prices for good fish (and pretty good portions too!) and great service.   Here are a few of my favorites: -Gail special roll (spicy tuna, more tuna, and ponzu- whats not to like?) -Screaming O -Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (this one is so good, it's tough to share!)",

I actually insist you take a look at that list because I've had so much better and so can YOU.  Teppan: 3/5 I love Teppan its just something as a family or a group of friends have to try. Basically Teppan is a style of Japanese cooking where the chef cooks in front of you and does cool tricks as you enjoy your dinner. Dinner and a show what a great combo. I love Teppan but the food is only good as its entertainer. When I went I had a horrible chef that wasn't interactive at all. He wasn't even social, maybe there was a language barrier I don't know but honestly what ever this chef was doing I could've done same thing. All he did was stand there and cook.   Nigiri: 3/5 I was happy to find a place that actually had fresh fish but the portions were off. I find this a lot in Las Vegas. The ratio of Rice to Fish is so off. This place isn't even AYCE (all you can eat) so they shouldn't have a reason to cheat people off on their nigiri's   Sashimi: 3/5 I was happy to see shashimi on the menu, you don't see to many of that around Las Vegas. Like I said the Fish here was fresh but the slices are super thin.  Price: 3/5 This place can be a bit pricy, there's no AYCE and the teppan for JUST the combination's it was about $20-40 (enough for 1-2 people). So you'll end up ordering multiple combinations and sides. The bill adds up.",

    "text": "Sorry for the length but this review really hurts. My colleagues and I have been going to Sushi Fever for many years (since 2003) whenever we are in Vegas for business. We have always found both the food and service to be exceptional and the prices extremely reasonable. In addition we always recognized most of the chefs and servers and felt very comfortable and welcomed.      Earlier this month we (4 of us) visited on a Tuesday (6/5) around 9:30PM to find an almost empty room. At the time we felt lucky about the crowd and looked forward to our usual exceptional meal and service. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow and unfriendly plus the rice seemed to be falling apart upon removing any Nigiri from the plates. During dinner we received a call from friends wanting to meet us there. After being told last call was at 10:45, our server began pressuring us to order for them at 10:30. In the end we all felt the food was okay (not great) and the service was nowhere near our previous 30+ trips.    On Thursday (6/7) several of our trade show colleagues wanted to go eat at Fever and asked us to come along. With 10 in-tow on a Thursday night we were hopeful for a redemption meal. Well...that did NOT happen. Service was EXTREMELY slow and considering the fact we had several novices to the menu, the server was of no help and couldn't answer basic questions about the rolls. I ordered for all and the food was a disappointment compared to previous visits.    Fortunately, I live about 10 miles from sushi fever in Texas where the son of the original owner resides and makes what I considered to be some of the best sushi I have eaten. As for the Vegas Sushi Fever, we can only hope it was an off week.",

The service was pretty bad, the server disappeared for almost 30 minutes. We spent as much time waiting at the table as we did eating. On a positive note, the carrot top roll was amazing, best roll out of the many we tried. Won't be back again, the service definitely made that decision for me.",

All from traditional hole in the wall places to upscale, fusion and other types.   Sushi Fever has hands down, the best rolls for our tastes! Everyone of their rolls has a sauce, either on the side or poured on top. Most of the sauces are some type of ponzu creation. My favorite is the number 7 special roll. The spicy edamame is also good.   If you like your sushi bland, more traditional, not with sauces, you might not enjoy this place as much as us.   The service is friendly and fast, we have found our new favorite spot in town.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago I went to the popular Sushi Fever on Buffalo and Sahara, where I have dined many times before. We had to wait ten minutes for a table, which may be a sign that the economy is coming back, or a sign they need more tables. One thing I love about Vegas is that you rarely need to make reservations, however, Sushi Fever has been around for awhile and has a large following. Though not the absolute best sushi place I have been (that Frugal Foodie award would go to the ridiculously un-frugal Sushi Sasabune in Los Angeles), the rolls are fresh, creative, and well-executed. Most are in the $12-$15 range but there are some relative bargains such as the Washington Roll for $9.50. This roll is stuffed with salmon, avocado, cucumber and one of my personal favorite fillings, yamagobo, which is a pickled Japanese root vegetable similar to a carrot in the shape of a stringbean. It adds great texture to the roll as it has a hearty crunch. The Washington Roll is topped with a very thin layer of salmon, which normally I would say is a cheap way for a restaurant to advertise more fish, but in this case worked very well since there were also big chunks of salmon inside. I think the roll might have been too big and salmon-y had the slice been thicker.   We also ordered two of my personal favorites, the 90% Roll and the Rock and Roll. Both of these are quite the mouthful but incredibly tasty, not least because they both come with an out-of this world tangy dipping sauce. The ingredients I can identify in the sauce are rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, scallions, tiny fish roe, and kewpie mayonaise, a Japanese mayonaise that in my opinion is much better than American mayonaises (see the ingredient shopping page). My dad had the brilliant idea of using a spoon to ladel the sauce on top because otherwise it is very easy to lose your roll to the bottom of the bowl while dipping. The 90% Roll has fried sof-shell crap in the interior, is wrapped with ahi tuna, and then is topped with chopped and baked scallops. It's not the healthiest but a must try. The Rock and Roll is much lighter but equally delicious. It has hamachi, salmon, tuna, and crab and is wrapped skillfully in cucumber. We also had to order the hamachi sashimi, because although rolls are fun to eat, they are definitely not authentic. A great piece of butttery fish with a little soy sauce and wasabi is beautiful in its simplicity and truly lets you enjoy the flavor of the fish.   The meal was highly enjoyable, but the service and ambiance ceratinly left something to be desired. Once we were able to locate our waiter the rolls came out quickly, but I don't think I'll be going to Sushi Fever on a Friday night anytime soon. For good reason is it a popular spot, and as long as you go at the right time, it should prove to be a fullfilling experience!",

We eat here every so often as its close to the house. Normally order out. We ate there tonight and I ordered a water. Rest of the group ordered misc drinks. Got the combo plate and was charged $2 more for beef. You have to read the fine print on the specials. For just my dinner and 2 cali rolls bill came to about $35 for just me without tip. I asked for a to go box and was given a teeny tiny box. Was afraid to ask for a bigger one as there might be a styrofoam charge additional so I just crammed everything in there and went on my  merry way. Place had a nice vibe. Big tvs everywhere. Not a whole lot of seating so come early and not during prime dinner times or you will have to wait. Pretty average food not worth the added charges. Portions were small. Other specialty sushi was good but again the prices were a high compared to other places and nothing especially great. The teriyaki beef that was an additional $2 was silly small. About 6 little pieces of meat with a splat of teriyaki sauce and not the best quality cut, kinda chewy. Have no reason to come back.",

I'm not a fan of the monkey roll, but if you like sweet sushi, it will work for you.  Everything else is on par, so I'd stick with the specialty stuff.",

    "text": "Do you want to eat alone because your sushi arrives so late that everyone at your table is done eating??? That's what happened to me. I get to see my friend maybe twice per year so it was a big deal for us to be able to go out together. The place had only about 5 tables full and they all were already eating so it was NOT BUSY. It took a very long time for the server to come and she made something up acting like she thought we were waiting for more people to come. Then, we ordered everything at the same time and asked for some plain chicken and rice to come right away for my one year old. They did bring rice but no chicken. My friend's sushi arrived about 20 minutes later....still no chicken for my baby. 15 minutes later some plain chicken comes. ANOTHER 15 minutes later only ONE of my sushi items comes. By then, my friend is done eating and the baby is over it. So am I. I tell them it's too late and to take it back. They don't offer any discount on the check. They don't even apologize. I ask for a manager and they motion towards the man at the front table counting money. I go to him and explain and all he says is \"Sorry\". I ask why the service was this way and all he said was \"I don't know\". Of all the million places we ca go out to eat for sushi in Vegas.....I am so sorry that we were unlucky enough to come to this one.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Summerlin from Chino Hills in Southern California. There were quite a few good sushi restaurants back home, and I was looking forward to trying and finding some good ones out here in Las Vegas. So, after a quick scan on yelp, we decided to check out Sushi Fever.  Now, I haven't tried any sushi from anywhere else here in Las Vegas yet, but compared to places I've been previously, this was easily one of the worst. We went on a Saturday afternoon, around 1 o'clock, and the place was moderately busy. Our service was a little on the slow side, but not the worst I've experienced. Our food, however, was a very big disappointment, especially for the price. The rolls average around $14, and based on the quality and quantity they give, I'd put their value closer to $7-$8. We ordered 2 Miso Soups, 1 order of steamed Gyoza, 1 order of yellowtail nigiri, 1 kamikaze hand-roll, 1 yum yum hand-roll, 1 Mistake specialty roll, 1 Volcano specialty roll, and just water to drink. The bill was $54. I'd probably rate this place a 2 - 2.5 star establishment if the bill was closer to $30.  As for our food, the miso soup was extremely bland, with an over powering taste of onion. I'm not sure how they managed to screw up miso soup, but they did. There was a lot of tofu though, so that may or may not be a bonus for some people. The gyoza was a limp sack of spinach, with a mediocre sauce on the side. We ate half of them before deciding we'd rather be hungry than continue eating those. The yellowtail nigiri was alright, nothing special, nothing terrible. The kamikaze hand-roll was definitely on the lower end of hand-rolls I've had, and all of the cream cheese was on the bottom for some reason, so the last bite was exceptionally bad. The yum yum hand-roll also managed to have an overpowering oniony taste somehow, despite me not actually seeing any onions. The mistake specialty roll was on par with a Vons brand spicy tuna roll, except this one looking like it was rolled by someone with tremors. Finally, the volcano specialty roll. This was easily the best thing we ordered off the menu, but it came out 10 minutes after the rest of our food, cost $12, and we only got 4 medium sized pieces of sushi. Plus, it was a baked roll, despite not mentioning that on the menu, which sadly my fiancee doesn't like.  I don't know if this place just has off days or what, but we definitely won't be coming back. I've generally been pretty pleased with the restaurant scene out here, and I was pretty surprised at how bad the food was for the price. I hope the other nearby sushi bars can do better.",

I always compare Albacore tuna sushi whereever I go to compare to Sushi Fever. So far no other sushi restaurant has come close to matching the soft, buttery texture of Sushi Fever's Albacore.  Their spider roll is my second favorite.  They don't serve the typical puny crab at Sushi Fever as I usually receive a large soft shell crab in my Spider Roll which is always crunchy and awesome.  Ignore the other reviews about the Sushi Bar being too high when you sit at it.  Never had a problem with its height and the sushi chefs are always responsive to your needs.  Sushi Fever has lots of very creative specialty rolls and for those not into sushi coming with their friends to Sushi Fever the restaurant has really good chicken dishes.",

This place was recommended to me by someone who does not use Yelp, therefore I was a little skeptical. We tasted a total of four rolls. The spider roll, which was the simplest of the four, came with soft shell crab and imitation crab and it was simply delicious. The  other two roles we tried had a number of ingredients and we're elaborate, like a large majority of the menu (which I appreciate). The Carrot Top roll was covered in thinly shredded fried carrots which tasted ridiculously amazing and snackable. That was by far my favorite, so good. Then the special number 2 had a little kick to it; it was nice but it was no where near The Carrot Top roll. For dessert we had The Monkey roll, a deep fried banana topped with imitation crab and etc. Such a different combination that worked so well; great way to end your meal as it serves as a dessert.   We were seated within a short amount of time and our orders took about 10 minutes to come out, which was fantastic; and on top of that they worked in an open kitchen to make the sushi. Everything we had tasted fresh, like it had just been made. Although the decor in the condition of the place was not at all bad it was nothing to write home about. But everything else more than covers that. I highly recommend Sushi Fever to anyone who even remotely likes sushi. Such a good experience.",

I was the last one to arrive. The rest of the table had drinks already and I ordered a water. The waiter must have forgot. After he brought out appetizers I had to ask again. When our food came, one person noticed that her crab meat in her California roll was reddish, like there was some sauce mixed in. When she tried it, she realized they used the spicy mayo by accident. Took forever for us to flag someone down but eventually we did and they corrected it. Everyone seemed happy, until my mother got food poisoning. It was either the crab or shrimp, not sure which. Either way, once that happens, it turns you off from a restaurant. We took my mom there for her birthday and her gift was being so sick she ended up needing an IV for fluids.",

So I take out rolls from here because I usually do AYCE and if I'm not going to do AYCE (all you can eat sushi) then it usually means I'm craving a really good quality roll! Alright, so I know that everyone loves the sexy #2 roll which has shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, tuna and topped with deep fried onions and mushrooms! I've tried it and it is delicious but I'm not a big fan of shrimp tempura rolls all the time. So I decided to get a mountain roll which is crab and avocado inside and salmon on the outside, topped with mayo sauce, baked and topped with eels sauce. How yummy ! But it doesn't stop there! I ordered a side of deep fried onions and mushrooms and a side of spicy mayo sauce( basically what makes the sexy #2 so yummy) I was so hungry that I ate in my car because I couldn't wait to go home. It made me so full and I eat a lot! So the mountain roll was $14, the side of deep fried onions and mushrooms was $3.50 and the side or spicy mayo sauce was .50 cents. My total was $19.49! Yes it is a little pricy but not if you value food! Not if you value the best roll combo everrrr! Hahaha try it! You're welcome!",

I think that is why a lot of people come here. Their sushi and sashimi is good, but definitely not some of the best in town. There are so many good sushi places in Las Vegas that this is not even in my top 10. I will say though,  that tonight I had the live scallop, and it was really really good! The yellowtail jalepeno was just so-so, and the sashimi platter was good, not great. I will say that every time I have been here the service was exceptional, they are quick to serve you and quick to clear away empty plates. The sushi bar is always a lot of fun too, very active and we always meet people who are anxious to chit chat about what their favorite dish may be.",

Super generous portions with California rolls, a salad, potstickers, an egg roll, and miso soup. I was jealous....and a little disappointed that there wasn't a real sushi option for the lunch special. I wound up getting a screaming O salad and a miso soup. The screaming O was, well, amazing (that's what she said). My kiddo and i were both put off by the soup. It had an odd dish soap taste and the tofu texture was weird. Overall, kind of pricey for a ten year old and mom lunch. I do wish there were more sushi lunch options. I'm talking a mean game about not being impressed, when odds are I will be heading back for more screaming O before the week is over.",

(Who knows, it's possible, once this chef was no longer there, I'd resume my usual business with Sushi Fever once again, as well as update my review.... I must add, it's a shame this deterioration happened, because I used to really enjoyed eating at SF. But the continual bad treatment just ruined the experience for me).",

We had OMG roll, Chicken Yakatori, Crunch roll, Veggie tempura and CA roll.  It was all great and the spice sauce was phenomenal too (although because it was take out we weren't sure which food it was supposed to go with.... oh well - we tried it w all of the rolls, and it was good w them all).  We'll have to try dine in sometime too, but for Japanese food it was in the top 3 of Japanese restaurants we've eaten from in Vegas (we lived in Japan for almost 8 years and never had a bad meal out - this was very close to as good as the food we had in Japan). Thanks Sushi Fever for serving great Japanese food and reminding us of our great food experience in Japan.",

While it has not always rung True this is one of those times I agree wholeheartedly.  They also have a favorite dessert staple of mine mochi.

I used a gift certificate that I was given at Christmas in 2008 (I had misplaced it and just found it recently) When I placed my order by phone I made sure the gift certificate was still valid, it had no expiration date so I figured it would be. The person who took my order said it was still good and that I could use it. The certificate  was for $25.00 so I ordered $27.50 worth of sushi and the person who took my order wanted my credit card #. I reminded him I had a gift certificate and I would pay any difference with my debit card when I got there, he insisted I give him a credit card over the phone I refused. He said ok, it would be ready in 15 min. When I got there an older Asian lady helped me. She was at the front counter as you walk in, she was very rude and very snooty. I gave her my gift certificate, she acted like she was put out because I was using it and then when I went to pay my balance with my debit card she got all upset & said she had to charge me $5.00 (that is the minimum) which I refused to pay, I only owed $2.50...she said never mind and practically threw my debit card at me then wadded up the gift certificate and threw it on the ground...can we say temper tantrum??? I heard her complaining to someone next to her...I told her I hoped the food was better than her service which I have to say it wasn't so needless to say I will stick to my regular sushi place 808 Sushi at Durango & Warm Springs!!! They offer  all you can eat and the food is very very good and the service is WONDERFUL! This lady appeared to be one of the owners and she should be ashamed of herself..maybe this review will humble her because something needs to!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I isn't bad sushi, for being in the middle of a desert. But like Vegas itself, it is a lot of hype and just average experience. The place was packed, so I know the food must be above average, but if this place was in California, it wouldn't last. The restaurant is great out in Nevada because Nevada sucks and the people here don't really know what \"good food at a good price is.\" The sushi wasn't all that fresh and most of the rolls showed the paper on the outside! Really.... name a good sushi place that shows the paper on the outside of its rolls? To compensate for the lack of fresh fish, each roll was doused in sauces and BS... Not for me I guess, but good for the Desert Dwellers out her that don't know any better.... The free soy beans, hot towel and cucumber were nice to start the meal, but the rolls were waaaaaaay over priced. Even for a place 7 miles west of the Strip. The  Carrot Top roll was pretty good, but nothing I'd brag about to anyone... The Sexy Girl #2 was god awful.... bad roll covered in fried onion, garlic and mushrooms. Just terrible.... I wouldn't feed it to my dog. Overall.... my search for good sushi in Vegas continues.... I won't go back to Fever.",

Friend of mine introduced me to this place, a little hole in the wall restaurant not so extravagant but cozy, they had the most fresh Uni. (See urchin) not many peoples favorite but if you know the taste of fresh Uni, you know what fresh is. I've tried Uni from many other places found that all other places either had a smell or not cold enough. Sushi fever delivers that freshness. Therefore I've tried my others such as super white sashimi that literally melts in your mouth and tiger eye roll with thinly cut lemon, apple rolls and carrot top roll. And I don't really care for rolls but this really was very good. I advise ordering apple roll first before any other. Its very refreshing like having a salad before a meal. Its a little pricey but I will definitely go back again to try others they have on the menu and non the menu. You can ask the sushi chief to make you a special and he will whip you up a surprise. Its well worth the money.",

Since 2000, I have been a regular, and I can't get enough of Joe's special roll, which is also to be had at I Love Sushi in Henderson (same chef).  Although the somewhat erratic service has in past months made a poor impression on visitors that we take to Sushi Fever, this week the service was solid. We took friends from Salzburg, Austra -- one sushi enthusiast, and one who went for the grilled shrimp -- and they were delighted, especially by the American-sized portions. While one of our friend's entree, which included both miso soup and salad, arrived all at the same time (as opposed to miso soup first, tasty house salad with ginger dressing second, and entree third), which made it challenging for him to manage all the delicacies set up on front of him.  My friend Sandra, who doesn't get to eat much good sushi in landlocked Austria, and my husband and I ordered our usual assortment of sushi, with Joe's special ($16) being the centerpiece. It's a large roll with deep-fried prawns and tuna and avocado on top, covered in the place's \"special sauce\" which is red, very liquid, and delicious (and definitely has some ginger in it). The salmon sushi, the California roll, and the spicy tuna roll were also very fresh and tasty. For dessert, we usually went  with just one scoop of green tea ice cream, which cleanses your palate and is a satisfying end to a tasty and healthy dinner. As some Austrian says: we will be back.",

The menu is loaded with all kinds of good looking rolls, but I was interested in more traditional style sushi.  Ahun gave me some amazingly fresh salmon, tuna, bluefin tuna, and then he even told me to try toe japanese mackeral which was great! He could tell that I was a sushi lover and offered me fresh/real wasabi which was amazing too.  I also had a few hand rolls and a very tasty mango salmon roll (no rice) that Ahun told me he created on the menu.  I come to Vegas every week and have not yet found any great sushi places, even in the expensive resorts the sushi is just blah.  Overall this not fancy, off the strip local sushi place is one of the best on Vegas, for whatever that is worth.  In L.A. or OC maybe this would be 3-4 stars, but in Vegas its a 5.",

This is preposterous and leads me to believe that the alleged foodies making such lists only get blood flowin down south when they get a free 15 course chef's special creation in chinatown or the strip. Because the truth is that I have never been to a sushi restaurant that can come anywhere close to matching the flavors developed at Sushi Fever.   And here's the thing, if you consider yourself to be a sushi traditionalist, i.e. it's Jiro Dreams of Sushi style or bust, then sure Sushi Fever is not going to be your absolute favorite. It's highlights are not the sashimi, nigiri, etc. I think those items are very good and certainly the fish is fresh but Im sure that the rice isnt as meticulously crafted as it is in Japan, nor the wasabi, and their soy sauce is indeed kikkoman...gasp! But it's the speciality rolls with their layers and layers of ingredients that develop flavors I have yet to taste at any other sushi restaurant anywhere in the country.  Rolls like the TNT, Ultimate Shrimp, Joe's Special, and any of the sushi fever specials, are simply packed with flavor. A critical eater may say oh no there's too much sauce it makes the rolls a little soggy...point conceded and irrelevant. This place is about the flavor and on that front it delivers 100%.",

Unfortunately, we were less than blown away.  The service was slow, the fish was not as fresh as we've come to expect, and one of our rolls was not ordered or overlooked by the chef, so it was brought to the table long after we'd finished everything else.  No apologies, just a shrug from the waitress.  We couldn't wait to get back to Texas and visit our old standby, which we did last night.",

The dinner begins with a cup of edamame, followed by the traditional cucumber and crab salad. Then sushi chef provides you with your tray of pickled ginger and wasabi.  The place was busy and is clean and lively. The bar area was pretty big with seatings on three sides.  Their menu includes a lot of traditional sushi and sashimi. They do not have AYCE.  My bf absolutely loved their Original sushi called Oops. It was $18 and has all seafood- shrimp is rolled with salmon and tuna roll and not using rice. He is coming back for it. I liked any sushi that uses cucumber instead of rice. The Pork Ramen Soup was flavorful as well.   The service was on par and food came out quick.  Although a little pricey, it's definitely worth it for some good fresh gourmet sushi. I would definitely recommend this spot for a date night as opposed to a large group.",

The service and the food are what made it memorable for me though, unfortunately I didn't get our servers name, but she was super attentive and had a very nice attitude. The food itself was delicious, we had a few crunchy rolls, dragon rolls, shrimp tempura, teriyaki chicken and other rolls. We honestly could've eaten more but we were waaayy too full! The portions were really nice. Also, at the end we went to our car and as we were about to leave our server came out to return a toy train our son left. We were so relieved because it's one of his favorites and losing it would've been devastating! A+ service right there.  Next time we'll come with emptier bellies and maybe try some of their mochi!",

Over the 10 years, my expectation's concerning sushi have grown higher, while Sushi Fever has stayed the same as it has always been...A-OK.  There are plenty of seats at the bar, as well as in the dinning area.  Over the years, they expanded their dining area to keep up with their popularity...and truth be told, at Sushi Fever, I prefer to sit in the main dining area right next to the Sushi bar.  The service has always been superb.  When you walk in, all the chefs and staff welcome you with a cheerful \"Irasshaimase!\" My water never goes empty and the staff is continually doing their part in making sure the dishes are tasty to your liking.  They are even willing to modify their regular menu to satisfy you.  So why does Sushi Fever get only 3 stars? Inconsistency.  Sometimes it's good, other times it is simply average.  I normally...let me correct myself...I always get the \"Chirachi Bowl,\" so I can enjoy a variety of fish in one order, with a bed of rice, no less.  On a recent visit, I ordered it, and it was delightful with added Yuzu sauce on some sashimi, and fresh fish to be found everywhere.  But on my  most recent visit, it went back to being only an average bowl.  This lack of consistencey leads  me to wonder, \"what is Sushi Fever's True identity?\"    If you like to order rolls with sweet and yummy sauce, or cooked dishes, this is definitely a good option for you...but if you want to enjoy, consistent, fresh, and high quality Japanese Sushi, there are other options in town you would do much better to experience.  -2017 review #55-",

    "text": "Let's be honest. We do AYCE for the value but when my friend wanted to celebrate her birthday at Sushi Fever, a non-AYCE restaurant, I was hesitant but I went anyway bc it WAS her birthday.   The Monica Roll ($15) was pretty tasty with spicy soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, tuna, and spicy mayo. The letdown of this roll was the accompanied dipping sauce-white, watery & tasteless mayo-ish sauce.   I also ordered the Jay Roll ($16) which was similar to the Monica but it had salmon, yellowtail, and jalapeno. The spicy ponzu dipping sauce was so delish that I dipped my Monica roll into this sauce.   I also ordered the Spicy Albacore roll. (Forgot the cost.) This entree may be the only roll worth getting bc it was too unique. The roll was formed in a circle topped with ultra fine fried carrot strings that tasted like sweet potatoes. The actual roll was sweet and ponzu salty with the cold freshness of the albacore. My mouth was dancing on a Japanese cloud 9!   I also ordered a Soft Shell Crab hand roll ($9.25) with avocado. Apparently it cost $1 more for the avocado. (The server didn't advise of the extra charge.)  In short, my first non-AYCE sushi experience may most likely be my last bc the value is better at the AYCE. I didn't feel that the fish was more, or less, fresh than the AYCE. The service was very  attentive.",

We really enjoyed coming here for sushi until one of the servers (Toke,not sure if I spelled her name correctly)disrespected our family dinner by practically sexually assaulting my husband when we came to have sushi with our son.She could not keep her hands off of him,paying him compliments and touching his neck and arms,working little too hard for her tip (I think she forgot that Sushi Fever is not a \"massage parlor\") and she didn't realize that I am the one, who calculates the tip... At first I found it amusing, but half way through dinner it became annoying and our 15 year old got very uncomfortable, asking to leave and not to come here again...Thankfully there are so many great sushi places in Vegas,where we can have a peaceful and intimate  family time...SHAME  on your server Toke for being unprofessional and compromising the reputation of your establishment...",

My first experience was Tuesday for dinner!  Absolutely loved it!  Great service all-around, mouth watering food , clean relaxing atmosphere!  Service was exactly what I enjoy. Tenitive, friendly .  Never made us feel rushed which gave us time to catch up!  Thank you for a wonderful experience.",

What do you mean an awesome Sushi hot spot in all if Las Vegas runs out of Uni? Inconceivable! It really happened. Maybe it was a sign to stay vegan!? The toro was a way too many chews to chew the toro; yikes. Service was top notch though. Ran into a beautiful new server who started at Sumo 19 years ago, then I  sushi... I love Las Vegas! How we locals know what we know and love what we love.  Great sushi with fresh Uni is what will pull me out of being vegan. Chewy toro is yuckie.  Roy you rock!",

The roll is delicious, the ponzu concoction pairs beautifully and the thin, fried carrot or sweet potato they put on top is crunchy and heavenly. I could put away 3 of those on my own. The screaming orgasm is also worth a try. It's a sashimi salad on a bed of shredded daikon in a sauce that's orgasmic.  They have another tasty roll that's not pictured here with fresh fish, wrapped in thinly sliced apple. The service is always amazing. I love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with my oppa's  Great source of protein after a hike at red rock!",

I love that when I sit down here they provide a small plate of cucumbers in a light savory sauce (like bread and butter at an Italian place). Their house salad with ginger dressing and miso soup are great to order while waiting for sushi. My go-to order usually consists of a Screaming Orgasm (share for two), Japanese Lasagna, Carrot Top, and a Kamikaze Handroll... I might order more but the flavors with these items are a knockout. On my last visit, I tried the lunch special for the first time. It was a great deal considering the price. The tempura was a little greasy but overall it was enjoyable. Anyway, I love this place.",

Basically had soft shell crab and tempura on the inside and the outside and fried mushrooms and fried onions and this sauce they made on the side. It was amazing!!! The flavors exploded in my mouth and it was a pretty decent sized roll, big actually but I wasn't complaining. And they were really fast. The roll was about $16 but so worth it and filling. There is a lot of seating too. Definitely coming back soon",

At this place it was exactly the opposite. I had to call the restaurant at 11:10pm to check what happened to my food. I had a very rude lady telling me that they were closed. I told her that I ordered my food when they were still open. She said that they don't care the driver arrived at 11:05 and because they were closed since 5min they didn't give him the food. I said to her that is not my problem I did everything the right way I ordered when they were opened , she answered that is not my problem either call DoorDash. OMG not professional at all just the worst customer service  I have ever had, very impolite and rude. Never go to this place you can have the same quality food and even better with a real customer care!!! DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!!",

For the best experience sit at the sushi bar and get to know the chefs.  My favorite things to enjoy here are:   The Yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno served on a cold plate.  For a little extra spicy kick you can ask for it served with a little Sriracha sauce.  Rock & Roll: Crab, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, w/ a cucumber wrap outside sprinkled with sesame seeds and a chef's special dipping sauce. (No rice or seaweed in this one)  Kiss of Fire: Spicy crab, tempura shrimp, cucumber, soft shell crab, and albacore tuna inside.  Jalapeno on top with extra spicy ponzu sauce.  IMO they have the best cucumber salad out of any I have ever tasted anywhere. The Spicy California Roll is excellent here as well.  Uni when they have it is fresh and delicious.  Friendly employees and a clean establishment.",

Each time we come here, we are greeted promptly with smiles and they seat us quickly. The guys at the bar are always super attentive and make sure you're getting everything you want.  The place is very clean and nice looking. And the bathrooms are kept well, which is always a plus.   -The prices are comparable to everywhere else.   -They have some of the best rolls I've had in town. They have a good mix of rolls, but there is something about the sauces they use. We've had similar rolls at other places in town, and they just don't seem to compare.   The best thing about this place is the \"Grand Canyon\" roll. Which is easily my favorite. It's a Cali roll topped with large pieces of shrimp, scallops, onions, mushrooms, chives and a delicious creamy sauce. Honestly, I could eat the topping without the roll itself.     I also recommend -   90% roll Linda Special  Baked Mussels",

We're originally from California with has some great sushi and this is still one of our favorites! Nicolas is our favorite sushi chef!

We can go crazy and have a big bill b/c there are a lot of fantastic specialty rolls, but it's always worth a trip over to get there sushi and you can get out of there full, happy, and with a small bill too.  I've had probably about half the rolls on the menu.  My favorites are the Something Sexy #1 (With ALL Salmon instead of Tuna...but I hear is great with tuna as well), Something Sexy # 2, Ultimate Shrimp, Screaming O, Japanese Burrito, Yum Yum (Scallop Cooked), Alaska Roll, Grand Canyon Roll...and they have the best plain old California Roll.  The Apple Roll is tasty if you're looking for something different, and I think this roll is alright, but a lot of my friends really like the Dale Earnhardt roll too.  Although I've eaten here a 100 or more times so I've ventured to even try half the menu...I definitely have my favorites and only try something new when I'm with a group or really in the mood for a different flavor.  This place is a great sushi place to take beginning sushi eaters, or even to take someone that LOVES sushi...everyone will leave wanting to come back.  The sashimi is excellent here too and always so fresh.  The salmon almost melts in your mouth.  My Dad is not a sushi eater and I convinced him to try a tiny bite of the salmon sashimi and he was impressed...even finished the whole piece!    Sushi bar is a fun place to sit and eat.  The sushi chefs are SO fun and love interacting with the customers.  Buy a bottle of saki and give them a couple of shots and they will hook up your rolls too.  ;)  They serve edamame and oranges at the bar at no additional charge.  Sushi rolls come out beautifully and each roll's presentation is just amazing here.  They do such a wonderful job.  Great lunch specials and offer  too.  And also have half the restaurant for Teppanyaki.  You can order the Teppanyaki anywhere though, and if on the sushi side of the restaurant it comes on a nice hot iron plate which is awesome b/c it keeps your food warm!  Other favorites are the Beef Terryaki...reallllllly good (not a fan of the chicken terryaki...you're better getting the chicken Teppanyaki b/c they use better chicken in it) and the Shrimp Tempura (which I don't order as often b/c it's fried) is a really great treat on occasion.",

    "text": "How likely is it that the following thought would ever run through your head: \"Man, I could be eating AYCE right now\"? If your answer is moderately to highly likely, then you probably won't have the fever for this sushi joint.   The attraction here is not AYCE; it is not an option. They don't have happy hour specials either. People come here for creative rolls made with ingredients other than spicy tuna, crab and fried shrimp. For example, several rolls include scallops. The rolls here average $12. You do receive complimentary edamame and cucumber salad, but don't expect any refills on those little treats! My husband was pleading with me to sweet talk us into some more edamame, but before I could even get up the courage, the waitress came and whisked away our bowl. No more edamame for us!  The atmosphere might not be phenomenal, but I actually think the sushi bar is quite comfortable. Plus, the sushi chefs are particularly friendly and helpful. I could tell that our chef was concerned about our culinary experience. He was eager to find out what we liked so that he could make suggestions. Little did he know that when it comes to sushi, we're rather simplistic and not interested in the fancy stuff. Although, I did order a roll made with cucumber wraps in place of rice-- interesting, pretty tasty. Our other rolls appeared a little sloppy, but overall were fresh and flavorful.  Side note: I will forever be perplexed why restaurants use fake crab, especially when they are charging $12-$15/roll. Is that their way of telling you that you should not order crab?  My conclusion: If you are someone who really enjoys creative sushi rolls and doesn't mind paying a premium over AYCE, then you might appreciate Sushi Fever. However, if you think creativity is overrated, and you just want to stuff your hole with rolls, you should probably take a pass.",

Every time I try a different sushi place when I'm away from Vegas, I become disappointed because its never as good as Sushi Fever.  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of five is that it is often overcrowded during lunch and dinner.

The bar is high up, and right in your face so you must really look up at the chefs to order, it isn't comfortable.    I didn't order a lot today, so this review doesn't reflect the majority of the menu, but should still be a fair picture of what to expect.  I ordered Tuna nigiri, and Mackeral nigiri, along with an Arizona roll (yellowtail, green onion, topped with yellowtail).  Tuna $4 - Nice and tender, not overly flavorful but a nice texture.  Mackeral $4 - Tasted a bit \"fishier\" than mackerel should and a bit tougher.  I wouldn't order it again.  Arizona Roll $9 - The yellowtail was chewy, and the green onion was too dominating.  Only after drawing this dry roll in wasabi and soy sauce did I enjoy it.    The quality of the sushi here is very average, and with the high prices, there are way better options for sushi in the area.",

First off the fish is not bad, it's actually pretty fresh, but the sushi is sloppy.  Sushi isn't much, raw fish and rice.  Half of what you are paying for is presentation and it is lacking.  Rolls with rice falling off and nigiri put together haphazardly.  My wife ordered some teryaki steak dish and it was grey, tough, and flavorless, I mean it SUCKED.    For some reason I have been here 3 or 4 times and I keep forgetting like an idiot that it's not that good, last time I went was the last straw, never again.",

Them and other poker players seem to have been great fans of this joint.  Lesson learned after eating there today?  Great poker players do not equate to foodies.  Nice staff, nice sushi chefs, but the food isn't great besides their fish tempura which was awesome-o.  With the surprisingly large number of good Japanese restaurants in the area you can definitely find better places than the Fever.  I will say, though, that most Japanese places in town have a large Asian clientele where this one is mostly Caucasian.  It's possible my many Caucasian friends will like this place better.  I could be used to different flavors, etc.  But they charged me like $7 for a unagi nagiri order.  2 pieces of mediocre unagi.  Really...it was dry.  Their rice is great but come on.  Unagi is supposed to be moist.  Should have known when their bento box comes with a California roll.  Yikes.  Their tonkatsu was dry and flavorless.  Again, maybe it's for Caucasian tastes as many of my friends distrust fattier parts of the pork.  But fat=flavor my friends.",

With out a doubt I had the worst dinning experience in this establishment that I have had in years.  Start with patrons, I baby screaming for the entire time.  Mother and 3 kids 10-12 years old that thought this was Taco Bell, or Micky dees anyway scream at each other, playing tag, and climbing in and out of chairs like they were the play yard. Now we have six tables and and it is like an outdoor play yard.  We ordered Spicy Tuna it was barely eatable very fishy. Anyone who eats sushi knows that you should not be over wheeled by the old fish flavor. Next ordered Shrimp Tempura, cucumber salad was terrible, house salad was lettuce with lousy house dressing. Shrimp was fried Panko flacks. The veg. We're fried in cold grease, and terrible tempura batter mix.  We paid 89.00 for a terrible experience.  This is a very fair review by someone who has travel all over the Orient and this is bad.",

I start with the Mountain Roll - then the Screaming Orgasm - then the Grand Canyon roll.  This is what I get every time and it never varies because I HAVE TO order these rolls and I'm so full that I simply can't order any more so I never get a chance to try any other rolls (which I'm sure are similarly amazing).

If Osaka is where I fell in love with sushi, then this place is where it became a torrid affair.  Order as much as you think you can eat, and make sure to share your sake or beer with the sushi chef...nothing is more fun than a liquored up sushi chef!  Plus, once they start pushing their custom creations on you, then you know you're knocking on the door to excellence.  (favorite chef from a couple of years back...Yeung.

I then ordered the albacore sushi, which is my test of all sushi restaurants and it was perfect, so I ordered another :)  This is the best and most unique sushi experience I've had in years, ever since the famous Nozawa retired in Los Angeles.

I'm not a big fan of AYCE and since this place doesn't have it, there is no pressure.  Some of the AYCE places insist you eat everything even if you hate it, which makes for a stressful dining experience (you will eat all of our crappy sushi roll, or else!).  Plus, I always end up leaving AYCE sushi feeling sick and swearing off sushi forever because my friends order too much crap and only want the fried rolls covered in cream cheese.  Maybe I need better AYCE sushi friends.   Here, all the sushi is quality and the sushi chefs are terrific.  I'm willing to pay more for good quality sushi in a fun environment.  If you like spicy, try the Jay Roll.  The Gail Special is also really good.  I agree with Robert T, eat at the sushi bar if you can.  Much better service and more fun.

You get to choose from two proteins, I chose fish tempura and yakitori and it also comes with miso soup, a spring roll, a California roll, gyoza, rice and salad. Wow, was I super impressed.

Our server gave my mother the check that was for $23 my mother only had $20 bills so gave her $40 and asked for changed. When the server brought it back there was only $6 when she should have been returned $17.  My mother got up and told the lady at the front what had happened, she was returning her the rest of the money when the server came by and asked what was happening. My mother explained the situation again and our server disagreed and said she had only received $30 from my mother which still would have made her a $1 short in the change she returned back! The two ladies were speaking in their language and refused to give my mother back her money. My mother explained that she would not be leaving them a tip and would never be returning! I am appalled that the server stole money from my mother and refused to return it even after getting caught! For this reason I highly suggest you don't trust Sushi Fever.",

    "text": "Growing up in Hawaii We never had a lack of fresh fish. Now that I live in Cincinnati, I wish i would of eaten what was more readily available as a kid. Once my folks moved to Vegas, they knew what i was saying all these years. Once you leave the ocean, you leave delicious fresh fish. The more land locked you are, the more it all taste like LJS, yuck :(  So while visiting my folks, mom wanted to go out for some Sashimi Ahi. Almost laughing on the inside we searched yelp to find something worth trying, and Thank the heavens above we decided on this place.  Its located in a business park almost, but as we drove by, Sushi fever was jam packed with cars parked in front of it, good sign number one.  As we entered the place was busy and hopping, but we got to sit at the Sushi bar, the best place to sit in my opinion and was given a bowl of edamame from out Sushi Chef, excellent sign number 2.  As Dad and I went on the hunt for what rolls we wanted, Mom just blurted out 3 Sashimi Ahi to get the party started. WOW this was some of the best fish i have had since leaving Hawaii. The Ahi was perfect in color, the flavor was super fantastic, and the texture was spot on. No gritty over frozen or pale flesh to look it.   This is a place to go!",

    "text": "Sushi Fever is my favorite sushi place. It is located right off West Sahara in between Buffalo Dr. and Cimarron Rd. I have been dining here for about ten years. I know that the sushi is consistent in taste and I enjoy the casual atmosphere. We always sit at the sushi bar, where it is easy to strike about a conversation with strangers. I always like to see what others order and hear their opinions which spurs me on to try something new. When we are in larger parties, we will sit at a table but not the same. We enjoy interacting with the sushi chefs and we often will treat them to a beer or sake (Kumpai!) Often, they will give us a new roll to try so it makes it worth it to be friendly.  The dinner begins with a cup of edamame, followed by the traditional cucumber and crab salad. The sushi chef provides you with your tray of pickled ginger and wasabi. We always start with the traditional rainbow roll which gives you a taste of salmon, ahi tuna, shrimp, yellowtail. I am a strong believer in avocado in my rolls as well. Just love the creaminess it provides in the rolls. Next we move on to the extraordinary Apple Roll served with a side of Ponzu sauce. The unbelievable thing about this roll is how much the apple that is wrapped around this roll sets off the taste of this fish. I could eat these all day long....seriously! We finished off with Rock and Roll which consists of tuna, crab, whitefish wrapped in  cucumber. This roll is served with a side of ponzu sauce mixed with a little creamy mayo. The fish always taste fresh and  I love the fact that whenever I eat sushi, I walk away satisfied instead of full. We close the meal out with oranges which is a nice topper instead of a heavy dessert offering. The service is spot on and friendly.   I enjoy trying other sushi restaurants but Sushi Fever is hands down the place I eat sushi at most often. If you are in the neighborhood, be sure to give them a try",

This was always our favorite place but today...ugh.. it was packed as usual tonight and my bf and I sat at the sushi bar. We ordered the Monica roll and kalbi. They brought us our Kalbi and told us they take out of rice, so we ended up waiting 20mins for them to cook it. Finally, they brought it to the table and halfway through, I saw a long piece of hair. I immediately stopped eating and asked for he check. I let the waitress know and when she looked, she asked me if it was my hair- seriously?? That piece of hair was cooked into the kalbi, IT WASN'T MINE....she seemed annoyed and then asked if I wanted it off the bill, mind you we still had half of the kalbi untouched. They ended up taking it off however they were noticeably irritated.   Sad to say, I won't be going back. Looks like I'll switch to naked fish. It's a shame because most of the staff is friendly but tonight was awful. Sushi fever, please make your staff wear hairnets!",

As soon as you walk in there is a sign that says \"No AYCE sushi\" lol I guess they get asked that question a lot? The place was a lot busier than I thought it would be so that was a good sign!  We ordered some rolls, a bento box and some hot sake.. The rolls range from $8-$17 so be careful, they add up!  -Apple Roll: fresh fish wrapped in Apple and served with spicy ponzu sauce... Wow I had never seen that done anywhere else so I thought that was pretty cool! It's tart green apple so the flavors went well with each other and it's rice less... Loved it! -Salmon lover: salmon wrapped in cucumber also rice less! YUM -Screaming O: tuna with lots of spicy mayo, ponzu and daikon.. If you love super saucy things then get this.. Another rice less dish -Carrot Top: shrimp tempura roll, with sauce and lots of fried shredded yams on top.. Presentation was nice and it tasted good too! -Spider roll: wrapped in soy paper.. Crisp soft shell crap -Bento Box: with teriyaki chicken and salmon = $18.95... No no no! It came with saddest looking \"salad,\" the smallest pieces of chicken and salmon, store bought egg roll & potstickers, watery miso soup and a big bowl of rice.. This was a complete waste of money!  Service was friendly and fast.. Everyone was Korean so I'm assuming it's Korean owned? The bill came out to be what we would have paid at AYCE,.. I'm more of a nigiri person but I will say the rolls here are pretty good!  HOT TIP; they give you complimentary oranges for dessert!",

They focus on quality cuts and this is evident on the fact they carry Blue Fin Tuna. It's MP so expect at least $10 for some nigiri. I was get the sashimi here. They will give you nice cuts of fresh fish. Tuna, Salmon, YellowTail, Squid, Mackerel, and one more I forgot about.   So you might be wondering? Why only 3 stars? This is an easy 4 star restaurant in terms of food quality. BUT THEIR SERVICE LAST TIME WAS TERRIBLE! They literally forgot I was there. I wanted to get more food after enjoying my first plate of sashimi. It was at least 25 minutes before a waiter who wasn't mine noticed me. It was another 30 minutes before I was able to get my check. I'm fairly convinced I could've walked out without paying and no one would've noticed.",

If you are familiar with the menu then you know to order from the specials menu. It's funny because I bring people from all over the world and they start ordering all the basics only to find out that they don't want it after ordering and trying the chef specials which are amazing. The response that people have is always the same. They say I've never had anything like this before. They simply love it. So if you find time to try this place here are some of the favorites. Something Sexy #2, Lamborghini Roll, Screaming O, Something Wrong #7, LiasLisa Roll, Grand Canyon, 90% Roll, and Don't Tell Mama just to name a few. Don't get me wrong the rest of the menu is fantastic as well, but the dishes above and a few others from the chef specials are what they're known for. Sushi Fever is always consistent and never disappoints you'll be glad you tried it. The staff is always on point and does their job by making sure everyone has a good experience while dining there. The only thing I would like them to change are the hours, they should stay open later. Midnight or 1AM would be great.",

Their flavor combination is simply irresistible! Their fish is sweet and fresh and makes you want to come back for some more. Our favorite on the menu, Carrot Top! They top these babies with fried strings of carrots - total party in your mouth. Our other favorite, Something Sexy #2, another one that has excellent flavor profile. Their staff is always friendly and we've never been disappointed. Some say they would prefer the AYCE sushi places and we get the cravings every once in a while but if you want quality sushi, this is the place to be!",

She got the Combo Lunch Box which seems like the best deal ever. You get rice, a house salad, miso soup, an egg roll, a california roll, gyoza, as well as your choice of 2 items of your choice in the list of options on the menu. She thoroughly enjoyed it & I enjoyed my Salmon Holic roll as well. I absolutely love salmon so this was a good choice for me. It was delicious. I definitely recommend this restaurant! & even though they were super busy, our waiter was super attentive and sat us pretty quickly.",

On my list visit, I felt it digging into my back the whole time, which made the experience less enjoyable.

If that was it, I'd give them a pass because maybe they had a different chef for the night but what made it absolutely unacceptable was the fact that there were so many lemon seeds in my food.  When I bit into the first one, awww man, so nasty, so bitter, bitter beyond anything I had ever tasted.  I figured, sucks when a seed slips by, bit into the second, just as nasty but okay, maybe 2 snuck by but I bit into so many seeds, i'm thinking someone must have disposed of seeds in my meal by accident because I came across 9 of them.  NINE times, I had a mouth full of bitterness.... NINE!!!!  You'd think I'd give up, but hunger does weird things to you.  I won't give up on Sushi Fever, but I will be sure to ask them to use less fat and watch for pits.  SMH",

All I tasted was the sauce. I am a fan of suaces on sushi rolls but this was ridiculous.  The fried tofu was horrible! The sauce was so sour I could not eat it.

The sushi never has that \"fishy,\" unsettling taste or smell, which is always a plus and screams FRESH!   Their list of speciality rolls is extensive and appeals to everyone's taste buds and their menus appeals to everyone, even those that don't like sushi. Double thumbs up for Sushi Fevs!",

Horrible customer service! Probably the worst in Vegas, and poor ventilation you leave smelling like fried fish! Yuck! Definitely not worth going to.",

Although even better it doesn't have the privilege of such a memorable name. Wow my mouth is watering right now while writing this review. This is also the place that turned me into a sushi fanatic.  What is bad about this place??? I have been there a half dozen times and found nothing. It is just far enough off the strip (20 min), food is amazing, and service is always impeccable. The pieces of fish are large and fresh, sauces perfectly paired, and the best green tea ice cream ever.   The atmosphere is also great which would explain why it is always busy. I have brought several friends that don't like sushi. The one who was willing to try is now a convert and the others said the hibachi and other hot entrees are superior too. It's a pretty expensive cab ride from the strip but if you are looking for a life changing sushi experience do it.",

We sat at the sushi bar and were met with lackluster service and slightly below mediocre sushi. It was possibly the worse sushi I have had in years.

No sushi option (unless you count 4 pieces of a cali roll as \"sushi\") and not much variety.   Sooo I love sushi has way better prices, fish, and rolls.
