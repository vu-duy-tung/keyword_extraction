(il Moto, ill Moro something like that) so so so good! We ordered an endive salad to split,very light salad with a bright dressing :) then our next course was the spaghetti with tomato sauce that the waiter had the chef whip up for us and it was cooked perfect!!! Every bite was gone by the time he got back to ask me how it was lol. For our main course we ordered the branzino which is what we order at a lot of other places and this was by far the best fish IVE ever eaten!!!!!! I've been all around the world,never would have thought my best piece of fish would be in Vegas but is was! The service was impeccable!!!!!! Best waiter and service staff we've had in a very long time. I come to Vegas 6 times a year and I will be coming back each time! Thank you Bartolotta!!",

If you like seafood and Italian, it's a must.  The sea bass was outrageous as we're the scallops and steak.  Pasta perfect!!",

    "text": "Possibly the most pretentious restaurant I have visited.  The theme is Northern Italian cooking with fresh fish flown in daily from Italy.  It is in the Wynn Casino just off the shopping area and has a modern European decor.  The tables are pushed so close together than you are literally eating a foot away from the next table, so it is kind of like group dining.  This is fine if you sit by someone interesting, but it is Vegas, so it is kind of pot luck and you are just as likely to sit next to really obnoxious people.  Fortunately, our table dining partners on the evening I visited were pleasant.  After ordering WAY overpriced wine from a mediocre wine list, they bring out their catches of the day in a glass case filled with ice.  They describe each fish in detail.  While this is interesting, frankly I can do without all the production.  If I want a lesson in marine biology, I will go to the aquarium at Mandalay Bay.  You choose your fish, then your sauce and all the sides are a la carte.  The fish will run you $60 or more for about 12 oz (they sell it in 3oz increments) and if you have a salad and appetizer it will easily run over $150 per person with wine.  The worst part is that the fish was bland, the sauce uninspiring and the sides were chain-restaurant quality.  The salad was fine but nothing special.  The bread wasn't even that great.  Overall, VERY expensive food that is not very good in an atmosphere that borders on weird.  Since it is located off the shopping area, I felt like I was eating in a suburban mall or something.   With tip for two the bill was $480 or so.  No thanks.  I can have a much, much, much better dinner at Panevino or Piero's for less than $100 per person.  I would give this 1.5 stars if that were an option.",

    "text": "I am giving this 3.5 stars and rounding down.  After Chef Bartolotta won the James Beard award for the Southwest I made a reservation here.  We started with some soft shell crabs and I was very disappointed.  I have had a lot of softshell crab recently because it is in season, but this one was not that good.  Not sure if it was the crab or the preparation but it was definitely not juicy like it should be and it was a little too crunchy.    I ordered his \"signature\" ravioli and my companion ordered something like spaghetti with meat sauce (sorry I don't remember the name).  The ravioli was very, very rich. Too rich for me and I like rich foods.  The other pasta, however was excellent.    Then the star of the meal and what they're famous for is the fish from the Mediterranean Sea which they bring in daily.  They offer a wide variety of fish, preparations, and sauces.  I went with the sea bream and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfectly executed and I really enjoyed the sauce with fresh tomatoes in it.  The tomatoes tasted like San Marzanos.  The service was pretty good.  Our main server was very helpful and knowledgeable but the other one who comes by to fill the water and other stuff was slow.  I was thirsty throughout the meal but couldn't figure out where she hid our water bottle.    I can't remember if we got dessert.  Total bill for two was $250  (no alcohol).  I'll probably be going back - I wanna try more of their pasta.  Maybe I'll order it from the bar if that's allowed.",

I can appreciate the fact that it is at the Wynn and the Koi water area is a very nice place to dine....HOWEVER...I will never, ever, ever pay $135 for a piece of cooked fish.  I just can't.  So we just got a bunch of pasta dishes and split a very nice octopus salad.  Those were all quite good but I would rather spend the $ at Mimmo Ferraro's instead of this place.",

Now I don't like seafood and Italian cuisine is not my favorite so when I found out that I was scheduled to eat dinner here I was a little disaopinted. But I decided to suck it up and not complane and enjoy the expienrence.  We ended up dining in one of their private rooms and we ended up eating family style. I have to say that I was underwhelmed with the whole experience. The food looked like something my family would make at home  and the service was pretty slow. I had to flag down our server several times to get a drink. It was almost like someone told them not give me alcohol. (Probably my bosses since they know me too well).",

    "text": "Went to dinner on 08/21/12 place was busy, sat at the bar for a few cocktails and a bottle of wine which the bartender offered to decant at the table. Good service from the bartender considering the bar was full and he still found time to decant our bottle of wine at the table. the tab for a couple of mcallen 12 year and other cocktails including the bottle came to about $260.  Everything till then was good, once we took a seat the experience turned sour. the food was great as was the wine. Ordered the charcoaled sardines, for appetizer, then for first course we had risotto frutti di mare, and another risotto that I cant remember along with two orders of the gnocchi. we ordered a 470 gram branzino which came with vegetables and potatoes. and then had the pannacotta and some other desserts along with some port.  the food was excellent. But the service was terrible. I work in the restaurant business and never write reviews and hardly ever complain about the service. But the service this time left so much to be desired. Even when the manager came over to the table and offered us a bottle of wine and the waters we were drinking on the house, he seemed out of tuned and not the least bit sympathetic to the table.  All in all fo a dinner including the tab from the bar that surpassed the $1000 for 5 people I would not be inclined to return to this restaurant. Although the food was good the service part was so bad I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone that  wants to have a memorable experience.  I really hope the restaurant improves on both management and service as the food is going to waste with this kind of experience.  With so many great restaurants in Vegas, and as being someone who goes to Vegas at least twice a year, I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon.",

    "text": "If you find yourself in Vegas looking for that special \"baller meal\", but you don't want to do another steak house or french restaurant, Bartolotta comes with my highest recommendation. I would tell you to order a few pastas to share, a couple pieces of grilled appetizers per diner, and you will be stuffed and happy for about $80-100 per person. Trust me because ever since I left Vegas two days ago, I think about the pastas that I ate here every few hours.    The transcendent pasta dish that I loved was a mixed seafood lasganette. Haphazardly torn rags of wide, homemade pasta, mixed with little pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, crab and shrimp in a light velvety sauce. One regular sized order was $28 and enough for each diner to have a few heavenly bites.  Also delicious was their hand made spaghetti cooked with salty bits of ground meat. I liked that there wasn't much sauce in the dish so that the focus was just on the spaghetti and meat. We doubled the size of this one and it came out to a reasonable $34 for a large bowl.   My one regret of the meal was that I didn't order a more \"exotic\" fish. I picked the john dory because it came with a high recommendation from the server, but, when the fish came out, I thought there was way too much meat for each of our 4 diners, which was reflected in the $195 price tag just for the fish. Not that it wasn't delicious - it was! But dory tastes much like halibut and I should have picked something else (the Orata is next on my list).  It was perfectly cooked in a sauce of tomatoes, capers, and olives and served with roasted fingerling potatoes.   We left crazy stuffed and happy for $80 per person including tax and tip! Though only I ordered a $20 glass of very good wine that was generously poured. I made my reservation 5 days in advance and was not able to get a cabana - hope to next time!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, \"What a waste of time!\"  If you want overpriced pasta that tastes \"blech\" then this is the restaurant for you.  If you want that every time you need something to have to wait and wait only to have a different waiter each time take you request then this is the restaurant for you.  Service: It is no over exaggeration when I say we had one women (Waiter 1) introduce herself to us as our waiter and take drink orders and bring them to us.  We had one guy (Waiter 2) describe the food items, make suggestions, and take our food orders.  We had one lady serve us our appetizers (Waiter 3).  We had another guy bring our main entrees (Waiter 4).  The first guy (Waiter 2) came back to check on our food.  The first lady (Waiter 1) brought the check to us, then opened the check holder, and for some weird reason in a condescending manner felt the need to explain how to fill in the receipt.  She told my friend how and where to write the tip, total the amount, and sign his name.  Are you kidding me?!?!    Food: *cappesante dorate con porcini-seared sea scallops with imported porcini mushrooms Two bland scallops on what looked like 2 cups of mushrooms.   Basically the plate was full of mushrooms with the scallops in the middle.  Apparently, mushrooms are not pricey, or they bought too many this week. *risotto ai frutti di mare-risotto with clams, scallops, shrimp, langoustines, calamari I was expecting risotto with distinct flavoring of the seafood.  Unfortunately, I got a mushy bowl of risotto that tasted fishy.  All the flavors blended together in a mushy mess.  It was very disappointing. *bavette alle vongole-linguine with clams, tomato sauce, white wine, garlic, parsley The first thing my friend said when he received his plate was, \"I thought there was tomato sauce on this dish?\"  This was another disappointing dish with tomatoes on it not tomato sauce.  My friend noticed I was not eating and asked if I wanted to switch plates.  I said yes, but his dish was as unappealing.  We ended up just leaving our full plates and going to another restaurant.  Definitely a MUST MISS!",

Let me break it down for ya:  Bartolotta is a beautiful restaurant in the most beautiful hotel in The Vegas! Waiting for your reserved table isn't too bad when there is a de la Renta store down the hall and jewelry stores galore to \"just walk through\" with your date. We had an 8:15 Tuesday night reservation, but requested an outdoor cabana, so we were prepared to wait a while. We waited a little longer than was comfortable (girls dressed to kill in sky high heels cannot wait longer than 30 minutes!!), but soon enough the reason for our wait came walking up the Bartolotta marble staircase-- Oh excuse me but Lisa Kudrow is here! Not that she would take a picture with us but that is a different story...  We were finally seated at our BFF Lisa's cabana table, gawked at the baller \"sculptural poolscape\" view, and soaked up the info that the last butt impressions in our seats were made by multi-millionaires and prayed for some good kind of wealth by osmosis. A supermodel I didn't recognize sat two cabanas away, as well. ANYWAYS. Our waiter Steve was very New York-y, obviously had given the same spiel a zillion times before, but was very knowledgeable about the menu and wine so that made up for the passe delivery. Wine, pasta appetizers, tap water, all fabulous.  Then came the fishies. Bream and sea bass, amazing. Skillfully filleted and plated, wonderful wonderful taste. The \"side\" of random potatoes is lame but I guess you aren't paying for that, huh? Dessert was a shared trio of delicious and wonderful gelatos. Out of my wallet came about $400 (for 4 people).  I am one of those people who is always happy to pay for excellent food, and this was certainly that. So much fun and definitely a night to remember. BEST PART: It was Cinco de Mayo week and some high rollers in a private room had hired a mariachi band to come play. Not part of the normal restaurant experience, granted, but it was so ridiculous to be AWESOME!",

    "text": "The Valentine's Day Massacre...  Dinner for 2, $600.  Only in Vegas.  Of course we realized it would be pricey and I have no problem shelling out that kind of dough for good food.  A slightly belated, but muchly anticipated Valentine's Day Dinner was the occasion for this particular splurge.  Nothing was bad and some was good, but for the reputation and expectation of this joint, we left less than under-whelmed.    The tasting menu was suggested by the waiter, of course, but I got the feeling he kinda lost interest in our table when we opted for tap water instead of a $16 bottle of Panna.  The meal consisted of 3 rounds of food.  Each round was 4-5 items dumped on the table to be shared, quickly and robotically described by the backwaiter.  This is all seafood and by the time we got around to engulfing all of the food it was usually lifeless and cold.  I actually, literally, honestly threw up in my mouth after eating a chunk of frigid octopus.  The somelier teased us away from a reasonably priced American Pinot Noir in favor of some Italian concoction of 3 varietals I'd never heard of before which happened to be twice the price of our choice and sorely lacking.  Again, the food wasn't all bad, just mostly bad, unimaginative, expensive, poorly presented and served.  Other than that it was alright!  Poor Paul Bertolatta, a great chef turned indentured servant to Steve Wynn.    Hits:  shrimp, scallops, desserts Misses:  penne pasta, risotto, fritto misto, service  I would rate Bertolatta as a glorified banquet-like experience.",

However the patio was closed due to the weather being too hot. So, when my better half was getting ready, I told her I was going downstairs to the sportsbook while she finished. I actually went to the restaurant to speak with a manager.   Pascal was the manager who took care of me, he was awesome!!  He showed me where we were sitting, which we changed to another table no problem. We discussed the menu, etc etc.    When I showed up with my fiance for the dinner, he took care of us beyond my expectations. He basically was our waiter for the night, alogn with the amazing staff they have to assist. We never had to ask for anything, and staff was available at moments notice.   We ordered the tasting menu, $155 per person. But it was one of the best meals I have ever had, and easily the best night of my life. The food was impeccable, not a bad dish. The tasting menu is the way to go, I would never do it any other way.....you get to taste everything. The langostines were amazing, the octopus outstanding, the ravioli were out of this world....and that's just the appetizers.   It was the best $450 I ever spent.....I can't wait to go back for our 1yr engagement anniversary.",

But nonetheless we were amazed at our luck and we thought we were so clever to find such a beautifully decorated restaurant at Wynn that people hadn't discovered yet.    The seared scallops were very delicious.  But it pretty much ends at that.  I had like, a seafood pasta or something.  We had the duck pate mousse which was good but the liver taste was a little too livery.  It was that unmemorable.  I remember it was not horrible but nothing extraordinary either.    The most memorable part of our night was when the alarm went off!  Yeah! Strobe light and blasting alarm noises for 20 minutes!  That is exactly how I want my $70 spent on a Saturday night dinner!!  Okay let's be real that's an extraneous factor.  But if I were running a restaurant, I would be extremely apologetic for such an incident and try to make it up to annoyed guests.  Free glass of house wine, free dessert.   Or maybe just an, \"I'm sorry for an interruption to your dinner.  We are doing the best we can to fix the problem.\"  Nope, the waiting staff was perhaps even less friendly than before and shrugged off the incident as if it is your fault you picked this day to come.  Come on, most of the tables weren't even filled they should be fighting to keep the few patrons there.  At most, I would just come back and order the scallops....to go.   I am taking my $70s elsewhere, thank you very much.",

    "text": "Bartolotta serves Italian food, but places a heavy emphasis on fresh seafood flown in from the Mediterranean. Your server will bring to the table a platter of fresh fish available that day. They're sold by weight; you must purchase the entire fish. Royal langoustines and one or more types of lobster are also available. The fish will be cooked very simply, and is served with one of two simple sauces.  Outside tables are available; if the weather permits, try to get one. The tables are on the edge of a large pond, filled with koi and dozens of silver hemispheres. Gazebos and large umbrellas above the tables add to the atmosphere.  Service is friendly and relaxed. If you order whole fish, your server will skin and bone the fish at your table. This can sometimes lead to slight delays, since you may end up waiting while this service is performed for another table.  **Meal #1: Whole Fresh Fish I started with mozzarella salad. The mozzarella was light and soft, very different from what passes for mozzarella in grocery stores. I enjoyed it, and it wasn't too filling.  I decided to splurge and ordered one of the fish flown in from Italy - red snapper. The sauce (salsa estiva - tomatoes, arugula, garlic, red onion, olive oil, and red wine vinegar) was provided in a bowl, to be spooned over the fish as desired. Accompanying all of this were some finger potatoes, roasted marinated peppers, and sliced zucchini.  The fish was very good - nicely cooked, tender, yet firm, with a mild flavor. The sauce ingredients were uncooked, perhaps marinated for a while. Spooned over the fish, it was a great combination.  **Meal #2: Royal Langoustines I started with Baccal mantecato - Venetian salt cod mousse. It was smooth, mild flavored and salty, served with greens and a fancy version of garlic toast. It doesn't sound all that wonderful, but it was really good.  Since I had previously tried whole fresh fish, I decided to try royal langoustines. These shrimp sized crustaceans were split in half, grilled, and served with olive oil and lemon juice. Accompanying them were good finger potatoes and zucchini, and excellent roasted yellow and red peppers. The langoustines were very good, but pricey - $95 for a recommended plate of five.  **Meal #3: More Fish! I started the meal with Octopus Salad: quartered cherry tomatoes, bright green fava beans, and chunks of black and white marinated octopus. The dressing was a small amount of olive oil. Very light, very fresh, very good.  For my main course, I had \"Rags of thinly sliced swordfish with Tuscan bread.\" Two thin slices of grilled swordfish sat atop cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, and Tuscan bread. All had been dressed with olive oil, a little vinegar, and onions. The fish was tender, not at all dry, its flavor not masked by anything. The bread had soaked up some of the dressing and was delicious.   I'm a chocolate lover, so when my server recommended Budino di cioccolatie banana, gelato allo zuccaro di canne, there was no argument. This was described as warm chocolate banana custard, passion fruit pearls, and natural sugar cane gelato. The custard was so thick it was served free form. It had a very dark chocolate flavor, with banana in the background. All in all, it was more like a flourless chocolate cake than a custard, but slightly softer and smoother. The gelato was wonderfully creamy, with a delicate flavor. Sour passion fruit puree with (tapioca?) pearls provided a good flavor contrast. Excellent.  **Meal #4: Slipper Lobster My waiter recommended cuttlefish as an appetizer. Good suggestion. The dish consisted of thick strips of a good sized specimen, simply grilled, with lemon juice and herb infused olive oil. The flesh was tender and sweet, with a definite charcoal flavor.  I decided to go crazy for the main course, and ordered slipper lobster. Why is it crazy? Because it costs on the order of $100 to $150, for which you get a few ounces of tail meat. It was served oven roasted. The meat is sweet and chewy, with a little more grain than Pacific lobster tail meat. The side dishes, served with all whole fish and shell fish, were as good as ever: good sliced zucchini, very good roasted fingerling potatoes, and superb roasted marinated peppers.  For dessert: torta Caprese. It consisted of dense chocolate almond cake with raspberries, dark chocolate sauce, heavenly gelato, and a thick curl of dark chocolate.  Not as good as the budino di cioccolatie (above), but still very good.  Bartolotta is among the elite of Las Vegas restaurants, surpassed by just a handful of places. Please order the whole fish if at all possible. It's expensive, but worth it.  Now about the expense...it's possible to spend under $50 for a three course meal, but with whole fresh fish the cost will be from $75 to $100. Order whole fresh shellfish and the cost will be higher still (meal #4 was $180). To the price, add drinks, tax and tip.",

I mean I heard that they have a marine biologist on staff to make sure the quality of the seafood is the best, so come on! Been here a few times and we just go with whatever the waiter suggests, and everything is always good. Langoustines are great, the risotto is near damn perfect, great branzino! The desserts could use some work, but overall I still give it 5 stars. Be prepared for at least a 2.5 to 3 hour meal....really, it takes that long to get thru an entire meal here, but hey, if you're gonna spend this much cash here, might as well make it last.",

    "text": "This place is incredibly overrated.  If you're thinking of checking this place out, I recommend just forking over a few more dollars for a worthwhile meal at Le Cirque.    First off, when we went to get a table, the hostess asked my boyfriend and I if we were wearing inappropriate clothing.  However she did not ask any of the other people waiting this question.  She then proceeded to seat us far away from other customers.  We think she did it because we were on the younger end of their customer base.  Regardless, other high end Vegas restaurants (including some at the Wynn) don't do this and this place shouldn't have.  We both ordered a pasta appetizer to start off with.  In addition to the wine, this was one of the highlights of the meal.  I had the spaghetti with meat sauce and my companion had the gnocci.   Both were excellent but pricey (15-20 for a small bowl).    The entrees were disappointing.  I had the fillet and my boyfriend had the rack of lamb.  Both were mediocre at best.  My fillet was suppose to have been medium but came out well done.  Again nothing spectacular except the price.  We were so disappointed that we skipped dessert and got the hell out of Dodge.  If you're looking for a fancy meal with good ambiance, skip this place.  I highly recommend other restaurants such as Le Cirque or Daniel Boulud instead of this waste of space.  Even the Wynn Buffet was better than this place.",

The Ravioli was exceptional to the point that we ordered another dish!! The Jon Dory tasted a bit fishy and this is why I voted 4 stars.",

I also requested gluten-free and dairy-free options and the chef baked me a special bread. The GF pasta was also extraordinary. The squid was one of the highlights and usually I don't even eat that! And omg dessert!...they surprised us with a special vegan mousse for our Anniversary. Also served over 9 different types of vegan sorbetto. EXCEPTIONAL service and such romantic ambience.

Service was excellent, and the bartenders were a perfect fit for a classy dining establishment that is mildly casual.   I don't think the food met expectations with how much creativity and taste I expected to come with a name like Bartolotta. Now first, I have to offer a disclaimer. I had been day partying at the Encore Beach Club and needed some food in me quite badly.  I know what you're thinking. \"Dude, you were day drinking. What do you know, drunkyface?\" My point... I could tell you that I was underwhelmed by the offerings and expected so much more, even with minor impairment.  The breads offered were okay. Cold, hard unsalted butter to go with three different types of hard bread. But yes, I ate them since the gin and tonics in my body needed something to help with absorption.   I had two appetizer pastas, a not-so-creamy seafood risotto and a tomato-based pasta. They aren't kidding about \"appetizer-sized\" portions, so don't think about sharing it unless you just want a warm-up bite. The risotto was quite subtle in flavor, which I can understand to let the seafood flavors shine. The seafood in it was cooked nicely. The tomato-based pasta was \"meh\" and did not leave much of an impression on me.  I realize I didn't try the fish, which is what they were famous for. It's difficult to convince me to go back to try fish, however, since what I did have was underwhelming for the price.   The fun part, however, is the unexpected sampling of different dark chocolates and Italian sweets at the end of the meal.",

I was here with several business associates and we ordered top of the line everything. Jumbo langoustines, pasta appetizers, branzino for 3 and 2 fillet mignons.   The langoustines were $45 a piece and came with the tails and body split and grilled, but the claws weren't cracked and we spent serious time trying to open them without any equipment on the table to do so. Not a lot of fish for a lot of money.  The appetisers were nice, but small. For pasta, you're spending less than a dollar on ingredients, throw in some more hand rolled spaghetti, it doesn't have to be as big as a main course, but please....  The branzino was ok, but just ok. They served it well at the table and it came with roasted fingerling potatoes and something else. Truly not memorable. Not bad, but for $45 a portion, I'd like something special. Again, not a lot of fish for a lot of money. (I've had this dish at Limani in New York with better results.)  Look: it's pretty. The waitstaff are very good. It's just pricey for what you get.  I spent the same amount on dinner in LV 2 other nights and was much happier.   I am willing to spend a lot, I just want you to \"wow\" me.",

    "text": "During our three-night stay in Las Vegas, where we enjoyed high-end fine dining on each evening, Costa De Mare stood out BY FAR as the worst of our experiences.  The good: the outdoor Veranda seating was exquisite and beautiful. The service, especially our waiter Mauricio, the sommelier Miklos and JP the bartender, we're all phenomenal.  The bad: first off I understand how a restaurant will want to reserve it premier seating for patrons who are desiring a high-end fine dining experience. It's also understandable that a restaurant would subtly tell patrons when making a reservation that the outdoor seating carries with it a Food & Beverage minimum. But as a matter of tact, you mention it once and you do it with a certain amount of subtlety. I don't appreciate being  overtly told on three different occasions before being seated, and in the presence of my date, that we have to spend a certain out of money to be seated where we requested. I got it the first time. Now you're just being gauche. Very lowbrow.  Now the food...Oy. With fear of sounding pretentious, I should preface that I regularly experience high end prefix dining. I've had the recent luxury of dining at Alinea, Le Nomad and Tru in Chicago.  All these restaurants serve tasting menus specifically prepared by the chef that run upwards of $200 a per person. Beverage separate, of course. These menus are characterized with 6 to 10 small tasting courses individually designed by the head chef with meticulous care to the diner's palette. The food is reflection of the Chef's talent and culinary creativity.  The high-end pre fixe menu at Costa de Mare was more like a mixed grill: like a leftover of what the kitchen had to push out. The food was not very good at all. And it's not an issue of money. I spent comprable amounts on every dinner during my 3 day trip to Vegas. The difference here is that it was a Hustle. They sold the sizzle, but left out the steak. I felt taken. I would have felt better had I dropped $700 on a single hand blackjack.  Two nights prior to our dining experience, we ate at Nobu at Caesars Palace. I gave the waiter free range to order for us the house specialties and top recommendations. The bill was about the same as we spent it Costa De Mare. But that meal at Nobu was memorable and exquisite. It was worth every penny, and I'm glad I experienced it. Costa De Mare is dressed up and pretending to be a high end restaurant. My money was wasted and I don't feel right about it.",

    "text": "**************************** UPDATE REVIEW **************************       Wynn's Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare is a 2013 Forbes Travel Guide Four Star Award winner. Bartolotta's newly refurbished dining spaces, both indoors  and overlooking the private lagoon, they finally reopened and it's such a beautiful space now. Featuring fresh Mediterranean seafood, Chef Paul Bartolotta was twice honored with the James Beard Foundation award.       I love this Italian spot because of the fresh seafood selection they offer. It's quite amazing that chef Bartolotta has a selection of tank in the kitchen back and a marine biologist full time to take of these fishes, now that's amazing as you have seen on Andw Zimmern Las Vegas episode.          Fresh Langoustine got flown in from the Mediterranean is a MUST TRY.   - Scampi Vivi  \"the single best live langoustines on the planet\" - It comes in Medium, Large, Jumbo, and Extra Jumbo. This time they only jumbo size and it was $40 well spent. It was about 4 inches in length and 1 inch width.   -  insalata di campo arugula, radicchio, frisee, Belgian endive, red wine vinaigrette was fresh and good.  -  bavette alle vongole  linguine, clams, tomato sauce, white wine, garlic, parsley - I thought this was a smaller size to try but it was bigger than we expected, perfectly al dente.  - risotto, scallops, uni, this was delicious.  - spaghetti con canocchie spaghetti, Mediterranean mantis shrimp, white wine, tomato - another perfect execution dish!  - The Branzino - whole sea bass, cruda... tomatoes, arugula, garlic, red onion, olive oil, red wine vinegar - this was divine, it was so good, light, and so fresh.        The wine list was amazing as well, well-priced, and the sommelier was really nice too. Our server was perfect from the moment we sat down till we left. Remember it was the CES 2014 week, but we were treated so nicely. Our customers were happy and that made everything perfect.       1 of my best meals in Vegas at CES 2014.",

Service is meticulous, incredibly informed and friendly, cocktails and wine list are exhaustive although on the pricey side, food is gorgeous and so clearly exactly as one would expect in Italy it seems almost surreal.  Pricey even for Las Vegas.  Atmosphere / decor is a bit Dr.  Seuss\"esque\", the display cart full of fish is a bit kitch but fine.  Sit outside if possible, then downstairs and decline the opportunity to sit upstairs as it's too loud and out of place.  Had a reservation for 8:30 PM, had to wait 15 minutes and ask again even though 1/4 of the tables seemed empty and they then sat me upstairs after requesting downstairs.  I agreed as I had a guest and should not have.  Hostesses although decked out and gorgeous,  seemed truly vapid and uninterested in anything but their smartphones and each other.  Bottom line- will go again because the food was just so good but not sit upstairs.",

    "text": "Many people may wonder, why is this famous Michelin star restaurant at the Wynn only received a 3.5 star rating on yelp? My personal take is because not many understands the True meaning behind the type of food it serves here, Traditional Family Styled Italian Seafood.  I had the Bravo Chef's Tasting Menu, and here are the dishes I got:    - small piece of marinated anchovies  - octopus, scallop, shrimps, crab, langostines  - four types of pastas - risotto, penne, rigatoni, ravioli  - whole roasted fish  - 6 types of desserts  I really don't want to go into the specifics of each dish ( take a look at the photos), all I can say is they were all worth the money you paid for ($180/head).   The wine lists were awesome, I had a glass of white, a glass of red, and a glass of dessert wine. The sommelier gives good suggestions on the pairing and I loved the Italian servers who enjoy cracking jokes and always carry a smile on their faces.  While some might prefer French dining experiences over the one that Bartolotta offers because of the differences in preparation and flavor, but I would highly recommend this place if you visit Vegas, you can find foie gras and truffles anywhere, but not the kind of food that chef Bartalotta serves.",

Beautiful burrata, tomato, basil classic caprese. Full at this point and time for secondo a whole red snapper carved tableside and plated with a ratatouille of tomatoes, zucchini and capers.

    "text": "As a follow up to my review- the AGM called and apologized for the service and whatever happened that night. I applaud the service recovery! I will be back to the Wynn and Bartolotta for their service and style! Great job Brandy!!!  As a Las Vegas native, I know my go to restaurants on the Strip, until tonight one one of them used to be Bartolotta.  The food was good, not great, but the downfall was the service! In the beginning of the meal the waiters were attentive, but once the entrees were served, it seems out table of 10 did not exist.  For example- I asked for a glass of Pinot noir about 10 minutes before my entree arrived, my glass came as I was finishing my meal (btw my pour was less than half of others). And let's talk about water! No one at the table had their water refilled until we flagged down a maitre d, who then finally directed a water refill. ( um Denny's does a better job then this team)  Lastly - our table wanted to go gamble and/or watch fireworks & again it took us flagging down someone else to see how we could get our check. Once we asked to get the check, it took 15 more minutes to finally get it.  All in all, if you want a great meal with great service avoid Bartolotta and go to the SW steakhouse.  One last thing- we were a party of 10, so the tip was already included- kinda slimy if you ask me",

We were able to get a bottle for about $100 and it really was delicious, but that was definitely one of the least expensive bottles.  I would say the only disappointment were the desserts. We had the lemon cake and a dish similar to tiramisu and we didn't eat much of either. The ravioli was unbelievable!  We had to order a second order of it, it was that good! Great experience,  very classy restaurant.",

The seafood risotto lacked some serious flavor and the rice was undercooked, my boyfriend chose some spaghetti dish and the pasta was not quite al dente.

We had RESERVATIONS and when we approached the host desk.. we were told to wait to set up the table which took 10 mins. Barely anyone in the place at this time and they weren't ready and on top of their game? Unacceptable.  It got worse when we were seated and the server ADRIAN introduced himself. He treated my friends like they were trash because they were asking questions about the menu and he said directly, \"What, you don't know how this works? Have you never ate here before?\" ....No we haven't ate here before and we NEVER would again. He was IMPATIENT, RUDE, EMBARRASING, and ever other bad word I can think of. He ignored our table and didn't even come by to ask if our food was OK or anything. He was sadly mistaken on his perception of my friends that we didn't \"have money\" or \"weren't his preferred client.\" I am embarrassed I took my friends there. Let me just say it was the worst $380.00 food bill I have ever encountered. BIG WASTE OF MONEY.  HORRIBLE SERVICE. Paul you should be ashamed you support someone like this.

    "text": "4.5 stars   I first sampled Paul Bartolotta's cuisine at the American Wine & Food Festival a couple of years back, and was really impressed by some of the seafood he prepared. It seems everything that the Wynn does is very elegant and grand, and this two-level restaurant is no exception. As you walk down the stairs, the main dining room is in view, as well as cabanas encircling the restaurant's private pond.  risotto with clams, scallops, shrimp, lobster, calamari - I love a seafood risotto, so this dish was a must. The risotto was creamy and al dente - just the way it should be. The seafood was plump and juicy, also cooked pretty well. A pretty good rendition of the dish in my opinion.  sauteed tiny clams with tomato sauce, garlic, white wine, parsley - This dish had a surprising amount of clams, as we had been told the appetizers were somewhat small. The clams were perfectly cooked, and the tomato-based sauce was light and flavorful.  Grilled saberfish - Bartolotta offers a number of fish, \"simply grilled\" as an appetizer. Here we have saberfish, nicely grilled and juicy. The restaurant consistently served some very fresh and well-cooked fish.  arugula, raddichio, frisee, Belgian endive, red wine vinaigrette - The only dish we ordered with vegetables - the salad provided a lighter alternative, but wasn't anything special.  spaghetti with rock lobster, spicy tomato sauce, white wine - Pasta with seafood is something else I really enjoy - spaghetti with rock lobster? Why not? This dish was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly with a slightly spicy, light tomato sauce. The lobster was probably cooked a little more than I preferred, however, as they weren't as plump and juicy as I'd expect. They were still good though. The crushed cherry tomatoes added a bright, fresh flavor to the pasta.  penne with Mediterranean scorpion fish, eggplant, tomato, basil - Compared to the spaghetti, this dish was a bit of a letdown. The penne was not cooked quite as well (a little overcooked), and the eggplant and firm scorpion fish did not provide the same exciting, vibrant flavors.  Ligurian style roast chicken, artichokes, asparagus, porcini, taggiasca olives, lemon herb sauce - Bartolotta is a primarily seafood restaurant - make no mistake. But, they do prepare a very nice roasted chicken. The skin, all around, was superbly crisp. The meat was moist and flavorful, and the accompanying greens and herb sauce were a nice complement.  Oven baked imported Mediterranean fish, artichokes, oregano - The fish in this case was a Mediterranean snapper. I love light, white fish, and I loved this dish. The fillet was really moist with a light and delicate flavor. The tomatoes and artichokes provided extra flavor, but were mild enough to not overpower this fish.  Ligurian lemon cake, rosemary gelato, sweet balsamic syrup - A moist and tart lemon cake was topped with a rosemary gelato. I thought the cake was nice, but the rosemary gelato did not stand up too well to it. A bite of every component was largely flavors of the lemon and balsamic.  In all, I was pretty happy with the meal at Bartolotta. It's a beautiful looking restaurant, and the food stood up to it. Seafood is done very well here, and in a variety of preparations. Some of the highlights were the risotto and lobster pasta, as well as the chicken and snapper. Next time, I will have to try one of the whole fish.",

I've had good truffles, and these lacked flavor entirely.  The fish we had was good, cooked well, and served with a nice olive tomato sauce.  Our service was poor; the waiter brushed me off when I ordered a second drink, saying he'd be back, and he never returned, so we had to flag him down a second time.  We skipped dessert because the meal took so long.  Overall, I was really disappointed with the food.",

They brought us a cart with all the live seafood options for us to preview.  We chose the purple snapper (never even heard of that before) that was delicious!!  They filet the fish in front of you.  We ordered two amazing appetizer pasta portions and a half bottle of wine.  Everything was amazing! Must try the olive oil cake dessert - yum!  On the way out, a nicely dressed gentleman got up from his table to ask us how our meal was and introduced himself as Mr. Bartolotta, the owner!  We were so tickled, we asked to take a picture with him.  What a wonderful, one-of-a-kind dining experience!",

When giving our name to the person at the entrance, he said three times, and without even making eye contact with my husband, who is 6'6\" and African American, that it was nice to have him with them, which I thought very odd.  That's okay though because we run into racial profiling off and on so I was just going to let it go.  We were led down the staircase into the dining room where we were seated at a big round table for four (we had three) and basically forgotten about after our waters were brought and the fish specialist did his routine and described all of the fish they had available.  It took so long for anyone to come by to take our order that I actually had to ask one gentleman if we could get some service.  All in, dinner was $180 before tipping and service was mediocre at best.  Would not recommend or return.",

I highly suggest their shrimp wrapped in bacon and crab cake appetizers.  The shrimps are a large size and are delicious.  I also really liked their octopus appetizer mixed with broccolini.  This is definitely a great restaurant for seafood.  One dish I did not like was their risotto frutti di mare was the dish that lost them the 5 stars.  This is a horrible dish.  The risotto was undercooked and was hard to chew and there were hardly any pieces of seafood, like three tiny pieces, seriously?   The main dish of Seabass was excellent.  I really enjoyed this dish.  The fish was cooked to perfection it was flaky in the sauce was excellent and so were the vegetables.  I enjoyed Costa Di Mare.  Overall a fine restaurant.",

    "text": "I have dined here 3 times as well as done the Wynn Master Class. The first time was at Christmas, then two times since. The food here is good, I actually wish I could use half stars because this place would get 3.5 from me. The seafood here is very good, and the pasta is delicious, I highly recommend trying the squid ink pasta, clams, and ordering one of their big fishes to share. We always do a salt crust one and no matter what we pick it is good! After seeing how they make the salt crust it makes me want to get it even more! The reason I didn't give them five stars is because for the Wynn, the service here is sub par. I regularly dine at SW, Wing Lei, and Tableau, and I never receive the slow service that I receive at Costa di Mare. Especially on our most recent visit on 7/18. Service started out decently, however my drink was forgotten and I had to reorder twice, but as the meal went on it began to get harder and harder to get a servers attention. It seemed like there were only two servers in the entire restaurant. The Bussers kept up well but after finally getting my initial beverage, a Bellini, I was not asked if I would like another. We finally got our dinner, saw our server, but I believe that was the last time we saw him. We also made it clear when ordering that three of us were sharing appetizers, pasta, etc, but were continuously only brought 2 share plates for each course. We waited almost 30 minutes between the time our dinner plates were cleared for us to order dessert. I usually love the Wynn for their standard of service and I definitely felt the fell short with this restaurant. That or they need to hire more servers. Overall, I will visit again because I love the food, but I will definitely pick SW or Wing Lei over this restaurant any day.",

We are downstairs in the main dining room but could see upstairs placed near the big staircase.  This will be a pricey meal.  We didn't order much it was several hundred dollars.  The fish is by pound by you can't exactly request say a 1.5 lb fish.  It just depends on what they have.  You can say a smaller or bigger fish from what you have.  Personal opinion here.... for what you pay I was slightly under impressed and will likely not revisit.  With that said its seafood and the Wynn and you should expect it to be pricey.  Everything was good and I have no complaints about quality.  If I could I'd give 3.5 stars.",

We had the fried fish appetizer pieces and again it was a lot of bones, very small pieces and pricey for what you got.

Our bartender muddled fresh berries and added exotic juices to create a wonderful tropical virgin drink.  When we got to the table we were delighted to have a spectacular view of the outdoor patio area and we're greeted promptly by our Server Declan, who never missed a step. He made fabulous Vegan recommendations for us, and we were even brought Vegan bread and butter, and a vegan Amuse Bouche. The staff kept our glasses full, our table bussed, and were very accommodating. We also enjoyed the Vegan chocolate cake for dessert. This was a real treat for us to have a night out with a True culinary experience. We will definitely be back.",

Nice view from the cabana but unless you make an early reservation they ask for a minimum of $150 spend to secure one.  Nice service, like any other upscale restaurants. Nice bread, i liked the olive twist. However the server never asked me for a second, but he did with the couple right next to me, maybe he was trying to help me from a carb crisis.  The langoustine was fresh and well grilled, but they didn't have anything larger than the extra large size, so a little disappointed.  I made the mistake of going for the family style tasting menu, which has 4 appetizers, 4 pastas, 1 main fish course and desserts. I must say they're all mediocre. Not only did they look cheap they also did not have great flavors. Some were salty some were bland. A cheap italian restaurant could do the same or even better. However they did give out a lot of food.  The bomboloni (italian donuts) were yummy and they gave extra sweet treats after that and a little bag to take home too.  In hindsight I would just order a few langoustines and be done with it.",

Atmosphere I have sat both outside and inside, and I would say definitely the atmosphere outside is mind-blowing. Very romantic and serene. Just note that outside seating is not available during the winter.  Service Not much to say about the service because everything is top-notch here. The servers will always check on you periodically and recommend you drinks and food! I love it when they push the seafood cart to you and show you their specials!   Food The langoustines and grilled shrimp are great starters. The seafood is so sweet and fresh! Every bite leaves me wanting more. I also love the clam drenched in tomato sauce as an appetizer. However, my FAVORITE dish here is the rock lobster pasta. It is hands down my favorite pasta in the entire world and this is after visiting Italy for a month! The pasta comes in appetizer portions and also entree portions. It has a few pieces of lobster and the flavor is so creamy and fresh. I really can't describe how good it is and you just have to try it out for yourself! I also got the grilled fish before which is one of their specialties. It tastes exactly like how I had it in Cinque Terre of Italy so I know it is legit. However, I think the fish is a little too bland for me and nothing too special.  Price The price could be a little steep depending on what you get. You get what you pay for and this is seafood flown in from Italy! For a nice dinner for two people, I would say it costs around $200.   Overall, I highly recommend this place!",

We both chose the tasting menu as the cuttlefish with black ink, soft polenta, pine nuts; and the grilled octopus caught our attention right away.   I ended up liking the langoustine, the best and the pappardelle, although wasn't the most pleasant looking of the plates was also very good. Everything else IMO was under-seasoned and just kind of there.

For instance... the fish was priced per 100 grams. I simply asked how many ounces are in 100grams... his response was that each fish would cost around $70. After asking several time how many ounces were in 100 grams, we finally looked it up on our phones. We ordered an appetizer of pasta that had truffle sauce.  The waiter told us it had truffle oil in it and not truffles. Then when we got the dish there was not scent or taste of truffle. It took us forever to flag down the waiter. We asked two other people beforehand if we had the wrong dish before he came over.  The waiter said that it was truffle reserves and it was a butter sauce. This was not how he or the menu described the food. Furthermore, the waiter would talk over me and interrupted me every time we talked. When we were asking about the truffles he decided to give us a lecture on truffles... like we didn't know what we were talking about.  I picked this restaurant because I had heard good things and I wanted a nice meal for my wife and my last night in Vegas. It was a total disaster. The waiter never checked on us and we needed to grab other staff to get him. I could go on and on about the service but I think you get the point. We obviously had a problem but a manager never came over.  We felt uncomfortable by the end of our meal and will never come back to this place. Normally we get dessert but we decided to just get out of here. Do not go here, there are a lot better options out there.",

The drinks we ordered didn't come and we had to remind the server. He didn't really check back on us during the meal. It's not like the restaurant was busy. He was just chit chatting with another server.   On the other hand, the food was amazing! The seared filet was perfectly cooked. The goat cheese ravioli was the most delicious and savory ravioli I have ever had. It comes in an appetizer size but is available as an entree. I would definitely get it as an entree. The same can be said for the seafood risotto. That would be great as a full entree too. The risotto was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor and bits of seafood.  We were too stuffed for dessert but what? No \"Happy Anniversary\" mini dessert like other fine restaurants give you?",

The appetizer mussels were good. And the fish at the end was good but had fairly large bones in it. The deserts were ok but none of this food was worth the price. The ambiance would have been better if we were not staring at another couple the whole time . Our table was in front of another table looking out into the water but also blocking the view. We had made reservations so I'm not sure why we got stuck with a bad table. All in all I, don't eat here maybe just have a drink at the bar and enjoy the views.",

The food was amazing and the service impeccable. Vegas is a town that overall does hospitality right in my book. The Wynn and their restaurants go above and beyond and it is one of the reasons my husband and I continue to go back. This restaurant has it all.",

    "text": "Our hungry party of 6, looking to be wined and dined Vegas style, were thrilled at being able to get a late night reservation via our bartender at Parasol Down in the Wynn.  What started out well, ended with two words....very disappointing.   The single biggest problem was that it took way too long to get everyone's food. Two of us opted to splurge and go for the ultimate dining experience ordering the special Top Chef menu selections.  You would expect the Bravo Top Chef Menu @ $175 per person to blow us away right?  I wanted so badly for each dish to reach the Top Chef mark and be better than anything I've had the pleasure of savoring before, but it just never took me there.    As each course was brought out, I could see the anticipation of the rest of our party, but because it was portioned for 2 we could not share the wealth so to speak.  Instead everyone else got filled up on bread and drinks by the time their entrees were served. We'd been promised \"gifts of the Mediterranean\", but at the end of the night it turned out to be the longest, most expensive journey on our quest for food perfection. It did not live up to the Vegas hype.    I don't know who to blame for a lackluster and well below par Las Vegas dining experience.  Initially, there wasn't going to be any compensation for having our group of 6 wait for two plus hours for the main courses, but after speaking to the manager they comped 4 meals and only charged us for the 2 Top Chef menus.    There were too many courses to mention and only a couple of stand out dishes.  Was the food fresh? Yes. Were the dishes authentic? Yes.  However, far too few pluses and several irking moments make it highly unlikely that we would return or recommend this restaurant when there are so many other great options to choose from.",

Our table's appetizers included the vegetable risotto, the cocotte (parmigiano custard), and my favorite: the rabbit.   I am very happy that we tried the aragosta spiny lobsters, who apparently had been in the Mediterranean Sea the prior day.  I particularly liked the citrus agrumi preparation.  My daughter (8) enjoyed the smaller cicala slipper lobster.   Everything was prepared wonderfully--the risotto was perfect, for example. For the lobsters, we had them shelled for us tableside, and they were each delicious.  I am not sure that I was able to detect flavor differences with local seafood from the northeast, but the preparation was great, and of course there was simply the novelty of tasting recently-in-the-Mediterranean lobsters.  All in all, a memorable night!",

The service is impeccable.  Waiters were friendly, sharp, and keen.  Topping off our wine glasses was a big plus in my book.  Definitely give this place a try when you are in Las Vegas, NV.

    "text": "In all my travels around the world, experiencing different countries and cultures (and of course the important part - all the accompanying visits to foodie spots), nowhere I've gone has come anywhere close to Bartolotta's disconnect between their staff's incredible pretentiousness and their awful service as well as mediocre food. Even I can excuse some pretentiousness if the service is impeccable and the food mind-blowing (I have been to France, after all); unfortunately, Bartolotta's staff instead chooses to show unforgivable disdain for their guests by failing on all counts.  There are simply far too many issues to list, but here are the lowlights: -- our party not being seated until half an hour after our reservation time, despite many empty tables all around the restaurant -- hostess accusing a party member of not adhering to dress code even though he was wearing a collared shirt; she backed off when we asked for a manager -- our apertif champagne bottle sitting lonely in ice bucket across the room even after repeated requests for a refill (apparently only at Bartolotta is the $250+ markup not for service) -- The sommelier insistently pitching me wines (all way above my stated price point) at the same time the waiter was going over the menu with the rest of my party - just totally rude (also note the markups here are far more than other Strip restaurants) -- rock lobster in the spaghetti dish was severely overcooked... cardinal sin! -- branzino, although properly served tableside, was done so slowly that the fish was basically room temp when we finally got it; also, there were many bones left in mine -- a busser twice trying to take my half-full glass of wine - what, do they get to chug it in the back if they pull this off?  Frankly, the food and service at a midrange local seafood chain is better - not even to speak of real high-end seafood places. Avoid this restaurant at all costs. I wouldn't even bother eating here for free. There are just too many good places in Vegas to waste your time on Bartolotta.",

I chose a a sauce and the waiter brought us another as a pairing with the snapper and of course he was right his choice was much better than mine. I was grateful for his input. ;)  Overall, great restaurant. Don't let me forget about the bar! The bar tender has the best Martina's in Vegas... I put back a few they were So smooth, two thumbs up!

Having ordered their tasting menu, the sign that things were wrong, when hot appetizers came out faintly warm at best.  There are many things I could point to that made this an unenjoyable dining experience but the risotto was the bad highlight of the evening.  I received half cooked rice grains for my risotto, when letting the waiter know, he proceeded to explain to me that it was Al Dente, and perhaps it was not to my liking.  I know Al Dente, I did not need a server to passing off uncooked rice as Al Dente.  For a close to $500 dining bill for two, your money is better spent at other establishments.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars-4 stars  Staying at the Wynn so decided to check out Bartolotta for my gf's birthday dinner. The inside was big and spacious but the outside patio seating was amazing! Pond or Lagoon in the middle with several metallic like balls it was real different and pretty in the daytime. The table sections all had draperies, just like a cabana style. Very romantic and just gives you a happy vibe. The menu has several pre fix options as well as family style and your regular menu.   _Risotto ai Frutti di Mare. An appetizer pasta dish. It was rather small but still pretty big for an appetizer. The risotto was nicely al dente and luckily it was not too rich or heavy. The scallops, shrimp, lobster, clams, cuttlefish and octopus were all listed but I did not taste all of the seafood. I wish there was some shells do you knew what fish was what because it was all just mixed in so they all just look like similar white fishes. Other than that a great starter.  _Pollo alla Riviera Ligure. Pretty presentation. The chicken was cooked nicely and juicy. The lemon herb sauce was a tad rich and pretty salty. Came with some vegetables and mushrooms that were a nice compliment to the dish since it did help with the saltiness of the sauce. Nothing too spectacular, but not bad either.  _Filetto di manzo al Sangiovese. The seared filet of beef was cooked perfectly. The filet was very juicy and a great rich texture. Not sure how I felt about the wine sauce. It was a bit strong and overpowered the steak a bit for me. Accompanied with potatoes and vegetables, a great dish to get if you love steak. _ Lobster Pasta. Don't remember the name but my gf got this dish. It was some appetizer lobster pizza in a red tomato sauce. The pasta was small and since it was an appetizer size there was maybe just one big piece of lobster. The pasta was cooked nicely al dente. The dish itself was real tasty and the sauce was light. _Panna cotta. This dessert was on the house for my gf's birthday. Not sure if it's on the menu but it was AMAZING! one of the best I've had. It was so smooth and milky and not too rich. Accompanied with berries and some other goodness it was finger licking good.   Service was great and friendly. Although the food was good I think it was pretty overpriced. There are other restaurants in Vegas for around the same amount of price and way better taste and experience.",

I don't know if it's because of the combination of lobster, clams, fish, etc. but it definitely could be seasoned better overall. Also, the portions are \"appetizer\" portions meaning they're the size of the small bread plate but the dinner portion costs double! (original: $24.50) When I received my meal, the \"dinner\" portion, I compared it to the small dinner plate and it looked EXACTLY like the portion of the appetizer. I was charged nearly $50 so I had to ask if my portion was a dinner. My server didn't see my original portion so he didn't know if my portion was correct. But throughout my meal, they knew I was upset with the dish because I barely touched it. The dessert was pretty good. I had the chocolate almond cake with cappuccino gelato and they gave me free chocolates and cookies to go with it. Overall, the price, portions, and food could have been better.",

The food is edible and the decor is nice; it's every other element that overrides any miniscule inkling of a redeeming quality.   This place reeks of pretentious snobbery (do I have a nomination for Understatement of the Year award?). Every encounter with a human being at Bartolotta was pathetic. From the host, to the staff filling water, and especially to the waiter, my family and I were treated as if we were 20th class citizens while dining here. We were all dressed appropriately and aren't slobs, obviously-- however, when we didn't bite on the waiter's offer for the several-hundred dollar special of the night, his demeanor flipped a 180 and we were legitimately treated less than an ugly sweater at a thrift shop.    And, to add extreme insult to injury, the prices are more ridiculous than trying to get through rush hour on the Strip. My family and I really enjoy fine dining-- typically in Vegas-- so we were prepared for the extreme price tags that typically come with the higher-end dining. However, the cash to quality ratio here just doesn't do it. At all.   Really, this is all you need to know. Horrible service and subpar food for the price (a price that could probably feed Ethiopa until 3013). Unless you own a money tree and find joy in sitting in a restaurant basking in the ambiance of other pompous, egotistical, shallow individuals, avoid Bartolotta.",

One of my uncles was in the mood for a good chicken parm but they didn't have it on the menu here. I asked our waiter and he went back to the kitchen to see what he could do. Five minutes later, he comes out saying they will make it specifically for our table only (because I asked). Both my uncles and Dad wound up ordering it with pasta, and I had the veal chop with roasted potatoes and fried artichokes. We were skeptical of the quality of the chicken parm before they got them because if it's not on the menu then they don't necessarily have practice in making it. But our worries were shunned when the entrees came.   A huge piece of chicken parm with big slices of cheese on top was on each of the three orders, accompanied by a side of pasta. They all loved their dishes and exclaimed that I was the savior of the night for this special request, and thanked our waiter many times for making this special order. They also each had a different kind of pasta as an appetizer and really like them. My veal chop was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The sides of roasted fingerling potatoes and fried artichokes were delicious as well, I couldn't stop eating them!   Our waiter was excellent as well, he picked out a great red wine for my uncle and Dad, and was on the ball with anything we wanted. While the dinner was a bit pricey, it was worth it. We all left extremely satisfied and fueled up for a night on the town. If I ever come back to Vegas and dine here again I am going to try out one of their fish dishes because they fly all their fish directly from Italy and the total time from water to entree is 40hrs; who can beat that freshness with the distance it has to travel!",

We ordered the Gran Menu di Mare which featured an assortment of seafood, but they served us instead the Menu di Paranza, one of many service mistakes of the night.   The appetizer course consisted of small dishes of:  Ligurian octopus salad (outstanding!!  Best dish of the night); baby clams with tomato sauce (so-so); seared scallops with porcini mushrooms (outstanding); and charcoal-grilled amberjack (good).   The Menus are really a great way t try many of their offerings.  Pastas were a seafood risotto (so-so); ricotta ravioli (another outstanding dish, probably one of the best pastas I've ever had in my life); and small rigatoni with scorpion fish and egglant (so-so -- could barely see or taste the fish).  The main course was a whole roasted branzino.  I've had whole roasted fish in Greece and France and am used to paying a pretty penny for it, so was not super surpised that the a la carte price for the fish was around $100.   That said, I'm so glad I didn't order this a la carte -- while the fish was good, it didn't blow my socks off and was on the small size compared to similarly priced fish in Europe.  We went with the waiter's recommendation of sauces:   the cruda (tomatoes, arugula, olive oil) was very light and paired beautifully with the fish, but the Palermitana was too heavy for such a delicate fish and overwhelmed the branzino.  By this time we weren't served dessert yet, but our 9.30 \"Le Reve\" show was starting in a few minutes so we had to rush out after only a bite of the desserts.   This was very frustrating since when I made the reservation, I asked several times if the time would be okay for the show and they assured me that it was plenty of time.   Then again, the reservationist also assured me that we could sit outside by the pool, but when we arrived we were told there were no spots there.  In addition to serving my husband & I the wrong menu, the server also put in the wrong order for another member of our group.  And though we said we were in a bit of a hurry to catch the show, it took FOREVER for our food to come out.   It was also very difficult to flag down the waiter when we needed water refills and to get our check.  I would be hesitant to go back to Bartolotta for a full meal, but the octopus salad was really special and I may visit just for that and other small bites.   Just beware if you're going here pre-theatre to stick to only a couple dishes, and allow yourself plenty of time.",

From the appetizers to the desserts, everything was amazing. The \"Bravo's Top Chef\" dinner menu is the way to go for your first visit, you will love everything and want to go back tomorrow.  An evening we will never forget and we will tell everyone we know \"you have to go, ask for Sergio and tell him Marton and Lisa sent you,\" Bravo!!",

We sallied up to the empty bar for an early supper, and damn if that bartender was not the best dining companion I had all weekend with the exception of Carrie and my husband. That only leaves one person out, and I leave him out because he was a little cranky pants all weekend.  Onto the food.  DH first ordered some seafood pasta to tide him over until the friends arrived. DELISH! With a very light tomato sauce and rock lobster. Lobsterlicious.  I started with the steak tartare, best I have ever had, I swear. With a lovely little frisee side salad and toasted Italian bread points. I know Bartolotta is a seafood man, but this tartare was delightful.  DH had a second pasta course, a beef course with a lovely brown gravy, I had the seafood risotto appetizer and Carrie ate  something that I cannot recall but I recall her loving it.  I started with a glass of white and moved onto red. Both times the bartender indulged me by recommending wine for me and letting me try two options before committing.  He should be Knighted. He's a prince among thieves, a man among swine, a bartender controlling the alcohol around people who like to drink.  I miss him.",

The tasting menus all sounded delicious, but we decided to order a la carte instead.  I loved the concept of fresh imported fish flying in from Italy daily.  The presentation of the daily selections was interesting, albeit a bit overwhelming.   I tried octopus here and actually liked it a lot (I am usually not a fan AT ALL). Amazing salt encrusted fish.  Delicious imported langoustines.  Fresh and perfectly prepared. I enjoyed every part of my meal.  Seating was cozy and service impeccable.  I will be back for sure.",

The appetizer sized pasta dishes was the perfect size to allow only 2 of us to enjoy a variety of items family style without stuffing ourselves.  Service - Phenomenal. From Sergio at the front, to the server building our individual plates from the dishes at table side to the wine sommelier who gave great suggestions and sexy descriptions of the wines. I must also have to add that big Italian menus can often seem daunting to try to make selections; however, the suggestions were bang on. Thank you! Atmosphere - stylish + sexy decor combined with a very pleasant view of the water feature. Request a table by the water!",

    "text": "Let's get the something out of the way first.   I HATE VEGAS. It is pointless, vacuous and insipid. I seriously can't fathom why people go there. Once it was great value, once it was a place with some character. Now...I could really go on.  The key thing I hate about vegas is the complete facsimile of everything you experience there. Nothing is as good as the real thing. The stupid Eiffel tower, Canals, New York?! It is all faux. It is then logical that my experiences of most of the restaurants there is much the same. On paper you have the best hit rate of anywhere in the world to experience high end chefs food, they all jumped on the stupid tourist spend money bandwagon and opened spots there. Obviously there are some exceptions, my point is most of it is not as good as the real thing.  Bartolotta 4-star? Well it is tough.   The food was amazing.   To start we had the best sweet little clams, undoubtedly the best langoustine I have ever experienced (and that includes living in Italy). I also enjoyed the cuttlefish. I think someone may have ordered a salad, but whats the point of reviewing that.  They show off all the fish in a wandering cart. Tell wonderful stories on how they grew up, who they played with, how Poseidon ushered them of to be caught for your dinner.  You marvel at the fact that these animals were swimming in the Mediterranean just a few hours before hitting your plate (and try to forget your contribution to global warming by fedexing them to a hot hell hole in the middle of the desert).  We overcame our guilt and for the main fish we ordered occhiona (big eye red sea bream), san pietro (john dory) and pagello (pink snapper). These are all cooked whole, roasted simply and perfectly. The come to table whole. They are expertly deboned and presented on a platter. You then eat like an emperor. The fish was sensational (note - they have lamb and stuff on the menu but the hell you order lamb at a fish restaurant is beyond me).  So why not a 5 star?  1. The fedex thing bothers me. Save your gambling $$$ and go to the Med. You'll have a better time. 2. Its in the Wynn, so the decor is hideous. It is like one of the housewife shows, like money puked-up furnishings. 3. It is in Vegas, I will eat at Providence for a lot less and not deal with the strip traffic/people/energy consumption.  4. Ah yes, this is the main rub. IT IS STUPID EXPENSIVE. The cost of doing business with fedex, the wynn, and the desert I guess.  Part of the issue is that you are also buying fish by the pound/kg and therefore when you buy that bream you really don't know how much you are going to spend. In fancy places you don't talk about money, so it can be a bit of a shock when bill comes. Be prepared for this, close you eyes and enjoy the fish.",

In the pasta section of the dinner menu, the price listed is actually for their \"appetizer size portion\" not their \"dinner portion\".  Evidently, there is some really fine print at the bottom of the menu to this effect.  The bottom line is, I thought I was ordering $24 plate of pasta, but was charged $56.  I would have been disappointed with the dish at the $24 price point.  The abusive pricing made the disappointment particularly bitter.",

Good news first - the langoustines were easily one of the best things we had all night, and I'm not sure I've ever had such perfectly cooked scallops. The vongole were also a big hit, as was the parmesean custard, which was on the vegetarian menu. The higlight of our meal BY FAR was a buttery fresh pasta dish with a layer of fresh truffles shaved on top. It was so amazing, I can't even.   On to the bad - I thought my octopus salad was a little chewy, but it was dressed in a really high quality olive oil, which was delicious. So it might just have been an eexecution thing, or maybe I'm really picky about octopus. I also thought the lasagnette fell totally flat. The pasta was kind of gummy and the sauce wasn't anything special. I also thought the lobster was just okay, it wasn't as tender as I like.  This is not a place for you if you are in a rush. We were seated 10 minutes late for our reservation and it was a while before anyone took our drink order or gave us menus. I'm all for taking my time with dinner but, please, give me a drink first! Not sure I'd return...",

I can't give 5 stars though because while food, service and ambiance were amazing the wine prices by bottle were highest I've ever seen.  I get it's Vegas, but wow.   First off it's The Wynn so you know it's top notch. The decor and ambience is pure class and sophistication.   I went with 2 starter courses of gnocchi and stuffed ravioli paired with Chianti (by the glass).  At first bite I was floored by both dishes.  Words can't describe how delicious!  The cheese and sauce glaze on ravioli really paired great.  The gnocchi was cooked to perfection and paired w light red sauce.    Lastly, if you are a fish fan you'll love this place too.  They wheel up to your table fresh whole entire fish on ice then they run through each selection.  This place is all class. Definitely take a special lady there...you'll be happy you did ;)",

Food: Inconsistent: 2 stars out of 5 Value: Poor: 1 stars out of 5 Overall: 2.5 stars out of 5  Dinner with spouse on October 8th.    Service: Greeted by a knowledgeable waiter.  Cocktail prepared exactly to custom order.  The server knew the menu well, did a little bit of an upsell - not too hard.  Dishes were prepared as expected, and were served without delay.  Excellent work by the waiters and bussers.  Food: (1) Scampi (Langostines) were not prepped well.  Claws were not cracked, neither were the legs.  Lobster crackers were not provided - Left about 40% of best meat in the shell.  Poor thinking on behalf of the head chef and poor value.  Tail was tasty.  (2) Lasagnette con ragu di crostacei was delicious, however the pasta was a little overdone.  Seasoning and taste were very good.  (3) Tagliatelle con porcini was average at best.  Pasta (again) was a bit overdone and did not look or feel house-made.  Porcini tasted odd - I suspect previously frozen or otherwise preserved.  (4) Veal chop was great.  Cooked to right (medium) doneness, Well seasoned, delicious.  Spinach was done right, and the cauliflower puree was tasty and the right texture.    Overall,  - great service; - decent (not great) food, - so-so value, mainly because food fell short of the promise. Will give them another whirl tomorrow.",

For entree I had the sole in brown butter sauce, excellent but I was already getting full.  Gelato was fine, I liked the pineapple sorbet better. Cappuccino was ok.

I called them several times to ensure they knew it was our anniversary and to make sure we had a special table. When we arrive we were shown a crappy table not even in the main dining area but on the top level. The hostess was clueless. We were just unsatisfied and thought we would leave but Manager convinced us to stay. That's for we went wrong. We should've left. They finally found us a decent table but not in the area we requested. We wanted to be outdoors. We were never told that there was a $300 minimum to sit outside. Which we easily spend anyway. Brings me to the next point. My husband and I split everything which we generally do because we like to share different tastes. We asked the waiter for a suggestion on fish. We shared one fish which the waiter chose. We had no idea of the price. We were shocked when we got the bill 143. for the fish. It was nothing special. Good but again nothing special. We've  been to plenty of 5 star restaurants in Vegas and all over the world. I would never recommend or go back. By the way we loved Picasso at the Wynn. I would definitely recommend that one.",

    "text": "I wasn't on Yelp back in the summer of 2005 when the restaurant first opened.  If I was, I would have definitely written a review of this place.  Just for the pure laugh factor.  Their fish presentation was atrocious and hilarious at the same time.  The waiter came out with a tray of dead fish with live, unidentifiable crustaceans crawling all over the dead fish.  My male friend and I could not stop laughing and my more sensitive female friend screamed.  Needless to say, we ordered the pasta.  Fast forward to last weekend when we met some friends here for dinner.  We reserved a cabana table outside and the weather was perfect.  The dead fish with live creepy crawlies on a platter presentation is gone, unfortunately, and replaced with a rolling cart of all dead sealife on ice.  Not sure I get the point of either presentation methods.  But the service by Antonio was impeccable and the food -  delicious.  As others have said, this place is expensive.  If that is a problem, just look at the menu, conveniently posted outside away from the hostess stand, and don't come in.  But if you are looking for a special night out, the tasting menu combined with some expert pairing from the sommelier (Jennifer) is a must.    We got the Bravo's Top Chef tasting menu ($175 per person).  The TV advertisement placement on a tasting menu is a little cheesy, I admit, but the execution was very good.  Everything is served family style, which is fun and different for a tasting menu.  Plus, you get a great variety of their seafood and pasta dishes, including a whole fish.  Tasty and Jennifer introduced us to some great new wines.  Sometimes red wine does go with fish!  Great desserts, too.  The outside seating is on a separate reservation system, so keep that in mind when calling.  Also, you may not want to sit outside if you have a fear of bugs.  There are not a lot of them but they do exist, even in Vegas.  Plus, the weather must be perfect.  I asked and they do close it when it is windy.  Inside or outside, I suggest this restaurant for a special and unique night out.",

Arriving to a handsomely appointed two story dining experience with Crystal Chandeliers, well appointed bar, spiral staircase to the lower level which was a more romantic setting along with some upstairs tables off to the side where are party of 8 began our adventure into the world of \"Mediterranean Seafood\" After being seated ordering a good amount of pre dinner drinks we began to peruse this rather shall we say interesting menu.  Also our waiter rolled a cold tank on wheels to our table opening up to show us the various fresh fish not normally found on your North American Menu's with some live  \"Langoustines\" which to be honest look like some sort of cross between a Lobster, giant shrimp and nuclear reactor mishap.   It's a diverse menu with many items as stated you don't see regularly.   7 persons ordered the \"TASTING MENU\" and 1 person stuck to the land lover route. Let me do the Land Lover first having an appetizer of the Ravioli Toscana which was made with sheep's milk ricotta, and Marsala wine glaze. Perhaps the best thing that was tasted all night $17.00.  His entree was a Grilled Veal Chop with a Rosemary glaze mashed potatoes and a vegetable. Good but nothing great at $52.00  The Tasting menu of $175.00 per person went something like this.   Each dish contained exactly 7 items or enough for 7 persons to share.  Sea Scallops, the afore mentioned nuclear reactor type langoustines, Octopus salad, Sardines, Various dishes of pasta with vegetables and fish, risotto with fish, Fresh Bronzini, some clams, Tuna, and yada yada yada.  They threw in without telling us some deserts that they up the $175.00 per person to $187.00  Last but not least the wine list was so over priced I almost gagged.  I won't even get into trying to describe each dish as look it was fresh, it was different but this is simply NOT MY TYPE OF PLACE and no matter how much I tried, I couldn't nor could 7 of our 8 dining patrons justify anything about the price or food that would every make me consider going back.  The service was top notch the place very nice, but I don't get the draw unless your European and like this type of food or simply craving to be knee capped with a bill that was almost $1900.00 for 8 of us with Wine & Drinks.  Sorry Guys EL PASO.    This is the second restaurant I've eaten at the Wynn / Encore that was awful upon conclusion aside from the ambience and the service so perhaps I see a trend here. With so many other options in Las Vegas I'll stick to what I know.",

    "text": "Why the low ratings people? Bartolotta was genuinely a great meal with great service. We had no complaints at all well except that we didn't have enough time to enjoy our dinner.    We made reservations for 4 here for a Saturday the day of and had no problems getting in for around 7:15. They asked us if it was for any special occasion and we told them that it was a bachelorette party.  Once we arrive, we only waited a few minutes to be showed to our table. This restaurant is very impressive and the decor is bold and rich and very thoughtful. We were greeted by the hostess that lead us down the spiral staircase to our table. It was so wonderful because we were sat by the open windows overlooking the lagoon and the outside Cabanas. We couldn't have asked for a better table with the exception of the cabanas of course.  After being seated, we were greeted by our lovely, fun, and energetic server, Antonio, from Sicily, Italy. He was so great the entire time. Because we were scared that we wouldn't make it to our show, Le Reve, I informed him that we were trying to catch a show. His response, \"Bella I and fly to Italy and back in that time.\" Later we found out from our sommelier who'd overheard my question that Antonio in fact could. He was a pilot in the Italian Air Force. I love that it was an upscale place but made us feel relax and the staff wasn't stuffy.  Our sommelier helped us picked out a mid price bottle of white wine to accommodate our dinner.   Fist course: The seared Scallops, which were perfectly cooked, but nothing special and was overpriced for 2 pieces. We also ordered the seafood risotto and the seafood lasgnatte. Both were tasted wonderful and had great consistency.   Second Course: We ordered a snapper baked in a lemon garlic butter. It is brought out whole and the server plates it table side. We ordered the acqua pazza which is garlic, tomatoes, and white wine. It was light with enough acidic and sweetness to balance with the the light flaky fish. This was my favorite part of the meal.  Dessert: We decided to skip out on the dessert because for one we were cutting it close and the other we were completely satisfied from the dinner.     I will definitely be coming back to Bartolotta for the fresh selection of seafood, the great wine, and of course the outstanding service.  Oh and it didn't hurt that the table next to us ordered us a couple of free rounds of drinks too ;)",

Love the same bartenders and servers at the bar.  I was alittle disappointed at first that Bartolotta's wasn't there anymore.  But they remembered me and recommended items that were similar to what I used to order.  Awesome!  Starting with the beautiful bread basket that I only took a tiny bite of each since we ordered so much.  Tasty and fantastic.    An absolutely must starter is the octopus! POLIPO LIGURE ALLA GRIGLIA Grilled octopus, rapini, crispy potatoes, & a red pepper sauce all melts in your mouth.   RAVIOLI DI RICOTTA CON CACIOTTA TOSCANA the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli, Tuscan pecorino cheese and sweet touch of marsala wine glaze was absolutely divine.  Every bite was mmm with my eyes closed.  Mmm!    CAPESANTE DORANTE CON PISELLI DI PRIMAVERA seared to perfection sea scallops, spring pea puree, lemon and pistachio.  Flavorful and a perfect combination together.  Lovely dish.    SINFONIA DI DOLCE AND PISTACHIO MOUSSE Wow!  Dessert was absolutely mind blowing!  The wafer and presentation along with the flavors of pistachio mousse and fruit I'll have to work my way backwards next time... from dessert to starter.    The wine and champagne list absolutely perfect pairings for their menu.  Wynn knows how to keep me coming back with his decisions on chefs he brings.  I was also disappointed when he switched the restaurant Switch years ago, and Society into a Poker room, but was very please with the replacements throughout so I should trust him more often in restaurant choices.",

Although I would say that I do feel a slight decline in food and service. And when I say service, I don't mean that the service was bad or slow, they just do a lot more upsetting now than before. Otherwise fish is as fresh and it used to be and all other items on the menu are worth trying. I'd say my favorite one is a squid ink pasta! This is a solid 4.5 star place.",

We tried a variety of apps as well as a fish entree and the Porterhouse. There were 2 pasta apps that really stood out. The cuttlefish ink pasta and the linguine with white wine, garlic etc. Not only was the linguine delicious with the garlic, parsley and white wine combo, it also took me back to my dad's home cooking. Yummy! I thought the presentation of the Porterhouse was impressive, however, it was bland and lacking in flavor. The 'Field to Glass' cocktail was light and refreshing. You can't go wrong with organic vodka, basil and rosemary-rhyme infused syrup. Try the panna cotta, light and creamy deliciousness.",

Perhaps, the wait staff indoor was more amicable but our waiter outside was absolutely terrible and rude.  He never checked on us the entire time.   Instead he spent a majority of his time talking with the couple in the next table.  Great way to make us feel special!  The absolute worst was his response to my wife and I when we asked him to change the table linen and place setting because it was covered in bugs.  He said, \"you're sitting outside what do you expect?!\" He didn't change or clean a thing.  We had to wipe our utensils down.    The food orders were wrong. I ordered a vegan ravioli.  I received the regular ravioli stuffed with cheese.  The risotto wasn't any good.  Took two bites, ate the bread and asked for the check.    This restaurant is just sad.  It was a Friday night and it looked like an empty nursing home.   I usually stay at Encore when I go to Vegas.  Typically, grab dinner and a show within the hotel but this experience was so bad that I will not be staying there again.",

    "text": "I love fine dining so I was excited to dine at Costa di Mare.  In terms of ambiance, it's beautiful provided you get a water side or nice lower level table. Tables upstairs have a totally different vibe similar to a cafe. The hostess was great and accommodated our request for a water side table.   I love wine so I planned on buying a nice bottle. Unfortunately, I didn't like their wine list which was primarily Italian wines and all their wine was excessively marked up (400%+). The least expensive options I could find were around $160 for an average cab that retails for $35.   The menu is very exciting if you love seafood as much as myself. The only gotcha is their fresh fish is priced in grams and the typical fish is $130-150. We opted to stick with apps and pasta.   Apps. We started with the octopus, which was good and tender. The only issue was the dish was served warm, not hot. We moved on to the crudo sampler of four fishes, which had good flavor and seemed fresh.   Pasta. Our pasta took around 30-40 mins after we finished the apps. When asked we were politely told the chef was not happy with them and they had to remake them. I appreciated the honesty, but we had a show to catch. The first two pastas were a cheese ravioli and a papperadelle. The raviolis were over powered by the cheese and the papperadelle featured nice home home made pasta, but a lot of salt.   More pasta. The next two pasta dishes were the linguine with clams and the cuttlefish ink ribbon pasta. Both featured too much salt and the taste was not there. We sent both back.   To their credit the manager recognized we were not happy with the food and the kitchen was slow.  They brought out a few complimentary deserts despite us urging them it was not necessary. At this point we had seen enough and we had a show to catch. The deserts were just okay.   So in summary, great atmosphere if you get the right table, poor wine list, overpriced fresh fish, below average pasta, etc.  could have been an off night, but I know I will not be back.",

I also heard rave reviews and was excited since I wanted our anniversary dinner for be a great one.   Upon our arrival, we were seated downstairs. We waited a while to get the menu (for drinks only). As our waiter came to our table, I get the feeling that he was not at all happy to have been serving us. I tired to ignore my feelings as I was red this dinner to be an enjoyable one.   As the night progressed, it became more and more obvious that our waiter was \"annoyed\". I am not sure exactly at what but it was obvious because even my husband turned to me and said he didn't seem happy. We tried to make the best of what the situation was. When we ordered our drinks, my husband's drink came back watered down. Totally unexpected . Costa Di Mare is highly rated and based on the menu prices, I did not expected to receive a watered down drink especially when I am paying for it.   We ordered pasta along with the Branzino. Don't bother asking the waiter what he recommends because you will just get attitude. Overall, I do not recommend this place. They are rude and the food is not at all great. Totally not worth it. I would suggest that you take your business elsewhere. Candidly speaking I have gone to restaurants where the food wasn't all that great but because the experience was so amazing, I will return multiple times and recommend to my friends and family.   I am not a resident of Las Vegas but my husband and I constantly visit because we just love Vegas. I would suggest that you take your business elsewhere because you will be treated as a one time customer here.",

    "text": "The ambiance of the outdoor seating is phenomenal. The fresh fish cases were amazing. The food quality was on another level. All of that said, there are downsides to this restaurant that do need to be brought up to speed to truly make this a perfect dining experience.   We ate here with a party of 8 and had an overall great experience. I ordered the cuttlefish ink pasta, truffle lobster tail app and a jumbo languistine. My food was perfect, the truffle lobster was one of the best pieces of lobster I've ever eaten. Others at the table didn't ask or understand portion sizes and some ended up with way too much or way too little in terms of portion. My wife ordered the lobster risotto and the dish was missing acidity and was a bit over cooked. For those who ordered whole fish, it was finished tableside and was a great spectacle to observe.   The good: fish quality is impeccable-the best in Vegas, the staff is friendly, the dishes (for the most part) are well conceived and well executed, and the decor is well done.   The bad: No explanation was provided about portion sizes except for ordering a whole fish.  Drink orders were lagging and the waitstaff didn't do a great job ensuring the table was properly served on this level. Many times, drinks had to be asked for rather than the server asking.",

The lovely dessert was a tasting tray of gelato, cheesecake, assorted beignets with 3 dipping sauces. $521.00 for dinner including tip. Service was.phenomenal and Randy made my birth day wonderful.

For the mains, the fush was beautiful andvthe steak good though more than 4 ppl said it was overcooked.  The risotto and ravioli were absolutely delicious.

We chose to do outside seating because the weather was so nice.  From the time we sat down, our waiter was responsive and very helpful. We ordered water for the table and then ordered our food. While we waited for the food, we were offered 4 different types of bread. They were all HARD, barely even edible. Like the bread would disintegrate in your hand if you tried to break it in half.   It didn't take too long for the food to come out.  Personally,  the risotto did not have much flavor to me. I had to add an abundance of salt and pepper to really enjoy it. The good part was that they are not stingy with the seafood. Every bite was filled with seafood. Then came the chocolate dessert. I'm not a chocolate fan so I let the others enjoy that part.  Otherwise, it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best I've ever had either.",

I think the food went from good to meh. The octopus was he highlight and the risotto was okay. The branzini was very fishy and the chocolate torte was way too dry.

Okay lets start withhhhh... The food heh? First of all, they have virtually no options except one dish for the people with seafood allergies. I know they had a couple different options but I am not TOO adventurous... It was a goat cheese ravioli with a very very rich mushroom cream sauce. I could've probably had one and been full.  I had a caprese (sp?) salad as well. The mozzarella was extremely fresh but it was overwhelming with all the tomatoes in it.  Overall I wouldn't go back. The ambiance was very... hoity-toity, but if you're into that go for it. I felt like a fish out of water here (haha get it?)  VERY expensive also...",

Food: 8/10 (very fresh) Service: 5/10  (low-class wait staff) Ambiance: 6/10  (business spot vs romantic)  Ordered: Chef's Family style tasting menu: $150pp + Insalata de piovra Ligure $25 Bottle of Pino Grigio $78  Food: We ordered the chef's tasting menu at $150pp, and added the Octopus appetizer because I love octopus and we heard it was delicious. The octopus was tender, and all of the seafood was very fresh (except for the uni, which tasted too much like a mouthful of ocean. Uni often tastes this way, but we've had fresher stuff in Japan, which had a lighter, sweeter taste.) The one complaint I had about the food was its presentation. While the menu had said family style, you'd expect that on a chilly night, a classy place would slowly trickle out the dishes to ensure that all food could be enjoyed warm, without rushing. We got all 5 appetizers at the same time, and all 3 pastas in the second round, and 9 flavors of ice cream/sorbet/gelato with 2 cakes in the dessert round. The appetizers (all with fish or seafood) were delicious but some were cold by the time we ate them, and the desserts were all partially melted by the time we ate them.  Service: Friendly waiters but I call them low-class because they tried to upsell us at every moment. For a classy restaurant where you know you will spend a lot of money, it's odd to be upsold at all. We wanted the tasting menu, and the waiter really wanted us to get the most expensive one (which we didn't,) and we wanted a bottle of wine and of course the waiter wanted to sell us a more expensive one than we wanted. So, odd.  One of the waiters also kept cursing near our table, which we found unprofessional. Lastly, we were outdoors - and the night was kind of chilly. The waiters never asked how we felt (I was clearly hugging myself to keep warm,) never offered a blanket or scarf, and never offered to turn on the additional overhead heater. I had to ask them to do that - and they actually turned it off midway through dinner. It just seemed like the waiters really did not care about the customers.  Ambiance: The outdoor section is beautiful. The indoor section feels more like a place to have a business dinner than a romantic one.  Visited April 2014",

Beautiful from top to bottom, truly a sexy restaurant.  The service is 5-Star.  Attentive.  Multiple waiters, assistants, and other staff.

We had than langoustine (AMAZING!), pasta, cured meats, pecorino - most things flown in fresh from Italy that day.  The wine list was extensive, the cocktails were delicious.  The desserts were nice and pretty and tasty.  Dinner for 6 with a good amount of wine and several courses and the fresh truffles ran us $2,000.00... and was worth every penny of it.  I'm not going to lie, though - I'm glad we were treated :)  An EXCELLENT restaurant for a special occasion or celebration.",

I don't normally rave about pasta dishes so this had to be exceptional and it was. The wine they offered paired beautifully with each course.

The food was bad too. Urchin risotto, scallops, fillet mignon, pasta, even cocktails, everything tasted weird. This place doesn't deserve to be $$$$ restaurant. It looks gorgeous in the pictures, however you can't see any of the views they show you on their website, unless you reserve one of those few \"lucky\" tables few months in advance probably..

The best thing about sitting down in Bartolotta is the WONDERFUL smell coming from the kitchen. I would consider coming back to sit and drink at the bar just to smell the place again. Service was fantastic, of course. I felt like our waiter's recommendations were a bit off.  Drinks I had an immaculate sidecar. I also had a perfectly wonderful glass of some sauvignon blanc blend that was VERY good with my entree.  Food The bread service came out and it looked lovely but it honestly wasn't that great. Bartolotta is playing the food game at a high level, but their bread service isn't up to par with the rest of what they're doing.  I ordered the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli as an appetizer - it was AMAZING. It was the best dish I tasted at Bartolotta. For my entre I chose the roast chicken, which was perfectly cooked over asparagus and some other veggies. The chicken was moist and delicious, with a nice, slightly crispy skin on top - a very nice presentation of an admittedly boring menu selection. Had I no budget to think of I would have ordered the seafood stew, but i just couldn't swing it.  Two of my friends ordered a whole fish - pink snapper? I tasted some of it and wasn't too impressed. Although the fish was cooked perfectly and the table-side preparation was fun to watch, the sauce that went with it (recommended by our waiter) wasn't a good fit. It was an olive oil and tomato number that was unbalanced, the acid overpowered the delicate nature of the fish. Had I ordered this as my entree I would have been very disappointed as it was $$$$ expensive.  Overall it was a very good experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if you've got the money to blow. I'd love to try one of the chef's tasting menus but wasn't up for the $155 price tag last night.",

    "text": "I was really excited when I read about this place.  Dinner with a James Beard award winner that combines Seafood imported daily from the mediterannean?  How could you go wrong?  The view, just like everything in the Wynn is breathtaking!  Seriously, I can't think of a more descriptive word to describe it.  We sat outside under the cabana beside the koi pond.  And, it was just like being on the Capri coast.    You can do the chef tasting menu for $140 pp or whole fish selections that range about $60 with different sauce preparations.    I started with the parmeggiano-reggiano souffle with fresh peas and asparagus.  It was interesting, but not WOW!  I'm eating a James Beard award winner here!  I then had the linguni with clams.  It was kinda bland and lacked flavor.  I had very few clams as well.  The pasta was kinda dry too, so I don't think it was worth the $30 for the dinner portion of the pasta app dish.    Everyone was kinda underwhelmed by the whole experience and disappointed because we thought our tastebuds were going to be tantalized but instead we were traumatized.",

It's a beautiful setting and the evening temperature was perfect.  We chose the 7-course tasting menu that featured dish after dish of amazing seafood. The lobster risotto and sea urchin and crab pasta courses were two of our favourites. The show piece main course featured a succulent Mediterranean Sea Bass encased in a salt crust. The table side carving was a terrific show that added to the anticipation. The final course was an over the top selection of desert options that was as delicious as they were good looking.   This is not an inexpensive place to eat or drink, but for a special occasion when visiting Las Vegas, this dining experience is worth every penny (even in Canadian dollars).",

    "text": "Last visited in 2005, under unique circumstances with people who'd rarely splurge in such a space, the only thing that had precluded a return to Paul Bartolotta's eponymous Ristorante di Mare was the continuous onslaught of newer or 'trendier' options, but returning with friend who, shockingly, also had overlooked the restaurant for more than two years one simply wonders why such a gem is so infrequently cited as one of the city's True destinations to dine.   Recently renovated, now with light whites brightening spaces that once felt more formal, and managed by a gentleman named Warren Richards who went so far as to set up an unannounced Skype with Chef Bartolotta, who was visiting in Italy, for my friend, dining at the Ristorante di Mare still revolves around a selection of fishes and crustaceans sold by price per 100grams and although a la carte pricing is admittedly quite daunting, the option is also available for one of three 'family style' tastings - the journey presented to our table a slightly augmented nine-course affair in part selected by Mr. Richards and partly on request, a few fine wines as well as a cocktail, tea, and coffee rounding out an experience that stretched just over three hours.  Beginning almost entirely empty, and perhaps half-full when the meal ended at 9PM, it was largely with tableside service from Warren plus one of his captains that dinner at Bartolotta progressed and after opening bites of lightly fried squid plus bread that proved absolutely irresistible across several rounds it would not be long before the first of several stunners arrived, the duo of Italian Mullet and  roasted Ricciola each simply presented with light saucing over vegetables, the brine of anchovies and bitter radicchio particularly inspiring when paired to the sweet, buttery Amberjack.  Diverting from sea-life momentarily on request, plate three featured a dollop of foie gras rendered almost incomparably light through the utilization of butter, booze, plus plenty of technique and slowly savoring each bite trying to recall a better presentation of duck liver in recent memory it was in the subsequent course that the restaurant's tableside treasure chest truly showed its importance to the experience, both the enormous langoustines and slipper lobster that had been alive just moments prior showing the sort of quality rarely seen on either coast, let alone at the center of a valley without a drop of saltwater in sight.  Again venturing back to the bounty of land for the first of two pasta duos, Bartolotta certainly lived up to its Italian inspirations with both the delicate potato dumplings as well as the cheese ravioli draped in a veil of Pecorino and buttery wine glaze, yet as good as both the small portions were, neither could live up to the quality of a subsequent course of seafood slanted primi, the inky risotto a briny yet creamy composition while the signature 'rags' tasted like a textbook cioppino with just enough acid from the tomatoes to balance the fresh crustaceans with hints of herbs and wine lingering on the finish.  Self-selecting a still-blinking San Pietro from the glass case as the culmination of savories, course seven saw the roasted John Dory deftly plated tableside over lightly roasted zucchini and although edges proved ever so slightly parched the center was rich, moist, and absolutely indulgent while a trio of sauces served to silence any talk of over-cooking, the Cruda and Agrumi equally well adapted to the white flesh with the later equally delectable drizzled on wheat bread of which far too much had already been had.  At this point declining an inquiry as to whether anything else was desired to be added a la carte, it was undoubtedly a bit of showing off that saw eighteen of the restaurant's twenty-four housemade iced delicacies delivered as a palate cleanser to trump any experienced to date, and although I'd like to say restraint was shown the fact of the matter is that little more than a few puddles returned to the kitchen - only the mango proving less than a spot on interpretation of the ingredient's natural flavor while the Coconut, Amarena Cherry, Black Currant, Pistachio, and Dark Chocolate were all amongst the city's best frozen bites.  Sipping a sweet Moscato while desserts were readied, and later ordering up an iced Americano to pair with the sweets, it was largely a Chef's selection that rounded out the evening and having previously been underwhelmed by Italian desserts throughout much of the city the quality of the quintet at Bartolotta proved every bit as inspired as the savorites, the Lemon Cake and Semifreddo each a great option for those favoring fruit-based flavors while the baba and spuma were rich and traditional with bold flavors amidst exceptionally light textures, the budino undoubtedly the heaviest of the finale with rich chocolate pudding finding its foil in sweet passion fruit plus one more quenelle of gelato.",

My party went with the chef's plated tasting menu which was $180 for each person plus an extra $30 per person for the langoustine (which as you can see from the other reviews and on-line is what they are known for).  Add in drinks and tip and you are looking at an expensive, 2 hour plus meal.  The restaurant is unique in that it offers fresh fish from the Mediterranean that is not typically available at other seafood/Italian restaurants.  Not very impressed with the langoustine - not a lot of flavor and not a lot of \"meat\".  Compared to other restaurants in Vegas that I have tried, I would not put this at the top of any list of recommended restaurants in Vegas.  If you are looking for an excellent chef's tasting menu and like seafood, I would suggest checking out Nobu at Caesar's (there is also a Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino but I have only been to the one at Caesar's).  Also, we tried Sage (at Aria) during a recent trip to Vegas and everyone in my party enjoyed dinner there.",

    "text": "This is a review for the family-style tasting menu, which has left me wary of any other pre-fixed menus in the future. If it hadn't been for the attentive servers, this would have been an overall horrid experience.  My family and I were staying at the Encore, which is connected to the Wynn and thus Bartolotta. We made reservations earlier in the day and were told that \"there would be no problem\" in obtaining a window table to enjoy dinner with a view. It was our last night in Las Vegas, so we were looking forward to a lovely farewell dinner.   The glitches started when we were shown to an upstairs table (the dining room winds downstairs below). I mentioned that we would prefer to sit downstairs in the main dining room if possible, and we were led downstairs to a table not next to a window because all the window tables were taken. It didn't seem right that such a lofty restaurant could not accommodate a premade reservation, so I spoke to the manager, and after quite a long slew of conversation where she informed me that they \"do not guarantee tables to anyone, as it's first-come, first-serve,\" she was able to provide us with a newly-cleared window table towards a side window.   First course: Tiny clams: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#J-D2TGrEMktEjyym4V-TQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Octopus salad: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#DIsrPZq1yvtaLF8gmXFbLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Sicilian amberjack: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#2loWJ6zVuLxr79xd9HalUw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Sea scallops: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#4l74lFN_CizmOrKtZJ0aQQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) This was my second favorite course (after dessert) because the tiny clams were cooked well, not too rubbery, and absorbed the flavors of the sauce well. The octopus of the octopus salad was poached well, but the flavors were just lackluster and the fingerling potatoes were slightly undercooked. I personally did not enjoy the amberjack; the flavor was very strong and the flesh was a bit stringy. The seared scallops were fine, but one of them had the rubbery evidence of being overcooked. And my biggest pet peeve? The dishes were all lukewarm.. much like how I felt about this restaurant after this course.  Second course: Tortelli: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#ve43cAl7j0zMfOK1Ku99Hw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Sea urchin risotto: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#lL8ohuy-0YtySByk9bTedQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Rigatoni: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#DGetq5jr9MD3va1a3xBmZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Again, the dishes were all disappointingly lukewarm. The tortelli was hard and bland, as was the rigatoni. I don't believe these pastas were freshly made, and the flavors weren't cohesive. The sea urchin risotto was mediocre, and I generally adore sea urchin anything. The rice kernels were slightly undercooked, and I didn't get much sea urchin flavor in the sauce.  Whole grilled fish: orata (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#hFVJxel60VheUzBJdD6kOQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) This fish came as highly recommended by our waiter. I really disliked the texture of the orata; its flesh was mealy and incredibly bland, and the sauces (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#WTjh9zIFMSM9Avx1UT3rog\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) that came with it overwhelmed the palate instead of complementing the fish.   Dessert course: Gelato, sorbet, ice: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#HZRgerjZ0jizjvpJETANLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Mousse cake: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#J8zb4iFlZI6dMerm3LAm2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Chocolate cake: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#rR6Q2H6JdasG834BT03TsQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) Panna cotta: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bartolotta-ristorante-di-mare-las-vegas-3?select=RouM6b8yd4ykkuGQcXtoUg#cHl8WSQ0KrfvBawpOP2pdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bart...</a>) This was my favorite course, as most of the desserts were amazingly well made and harbored the lusciousness that I had expected of all the courses. I wasn't too impressed by the gelato, sorbet, and flavored ice because they tasted rather artificial, but the mousse cake was heavenly and probably my favorite. The chocolate cake was dense but good, and the sliver of dark chocolate tasted freshly made. The panna cotta had a lovely silky texture but was a little too liquidy, although the berry compote set it off nicely.  The tasting menu came out to be upwards of $150 per person, which is an atrocious amount to pay for mediocre preparation and unoriginal fare. I don't believe I'll be back.",

But sometimes you need to splurge and this place won't disappoint.  Some notes: -They begin with a seafood cart with the fresh fish of the evening. We elected to share the John Dory. Quite honestly, it was good but not worth the hype. I have had much tastier fish.  -The pasta dishes were fantastic and the risotto was up there with some of the best I have ever had.  -We had some langoustines. Hardly any meat. A big tease. Skip these. Service was very good and this was a very enjoyable night. Steve Wynn even walked by with his wife on the way to his table and said hello.",

The service was excellent, our reservation got us a table at exactly the promised time, and the food was excellent.  We did the Top Chef tasting menu. The grilled lobster tail, shrimp and langoustine were excellent, and the scallop with mushroom and parmesan cheese was one of the best scallops I've had. The pastas were terrific and unique, including handmade cheese ravioli and a shrimp risotto cooked with crustacean broth that gave it a unique flavor.  interestingly, the least remarkable dish was the main fish course which was a full sea bream for 6 people cooked in a salt crust and prepared for plating at our table.  The dessert sampling was incredible. Only complain is that the waiter came by and removed all the desserts including one that we hadn't yet tried because we were told to let it come to room temperature for a few minutes, and by the time we noticed, he had taken an untouched dessert that we were all waiting to try.  Update: The restaurant is now Costa di Mare, the menu is almost identical to when it was Bartolotta. Still excellent. Great service.",

Our water glasses never came close to being empty.   The food was pretty good, but I wish I had ordered something else. My wife tried the spaghetti and it was ok, but nothing to rave about. I tried the Rigatoni with short ribs and it was good, but I will try something else next time.   The shining point was the desert. It was my birthday, so I think they gave me something that wasn't on the menu. They brought out a tray with several chocolates and candies and it was fantastic!!  Also, they have my wife a vegan/vegetarian only menu, which she LOVED. Most places don't do this...so it was very nice.   Great experience overall...but I'm going to try one of their seafood options next time.",

    "text": "What reeks of pretention, but has the nerve to serve me a plate of bland pasta with overdone lobster stuck in its shell and no utensil to get it out?  Did you guess the restaurant Bartolotta?  Congratulations!  You've won an overpriced, underwhelming dinner in a beautiful restaurant.    This was the most disappointing meal of a recent girls trip to Vegas.  I had selected Bartolotta as our \"fancy\" dinner to celebrate my last days as a bachelorette, and had high hopes.  I mean, James Beard award, come on.  Our hotel concierge made us the reservation, and we had asked for patio seating.  We waited for about 10 minutes for our table, even though the restaurant didn't appear busy, and we were seated indoors, but at a table by a window.   Note to diners: if you want good service, come with a giant neon wallet full of money.   Pretty much as soon as we asked for iced water vs. bottled water our waiter was done with our table.    What we ordered: 1) The assorted fried fish appetizer.  OMG, if you take one thing away from this review, please for the love, do not order this dish.  It included small whole fried sardines, a whole fried crab, and rubbery calamari, it was also completely lacking in seasoning.  Let's just say my cousin vomited up a sardine about two hours after dinner.  2) Scallop appetizer.  This dish was pretty good, but for $25 for TWO scallops, I expected better.  3) I ordered the lobster pasta.  Completely unremarkable sauce, and overdone, chewy lobster.  AND the lobster was still in the shell, and I was given no utensil to get it out.  I had to use my butter knife to pry it from the shell.  4) The other ladies ordered seafood pasta they thought was mediocre.  5)  The beef pasta was considered the best dish of the night, at a seafood restaurant... hmm.    Not once did our waiter come to check on how our food was.  We had to continually flag someone down if we needed anything, like another drink.  We finally complained when the bill came, and the manager gave us a little face time, but even that felt canned and insincere.  I would never come back here.",

Killed some time at the bar with a peach bellini- yum! The bartender was also very generous with letting my boyfriend sample various red wines before deciding on a glass.  When our table was ready, the hostess took our drinks in a tray and led us downstairs to a large cozy booth with a great view of the restaurant and outdoor area. For appetizers, we ordered steamed clams and gnocchi. Both were so good, I wish I had ordered the pasta in an entree portion! For our mains, we decided to share a whole sea bass, which they cooked and brought out to filet right in front of us. The fish was exceptional- so fresh and flakey! The server did an amazing job at fileting it, I only found one bone in my plate. You get to choose the type of sauce you want with your fish...so I'd suggest asking your server which kind is best paired with the type of fish you're having. For dessert, we had a trio of gelato- banana, coconut, and pistachio. My favorite was the coconut, but all three were really good. The banana one tasted a bit funny to me and I couldn't pinpoint why until my boyfriend pointed out that it tasted just like banana bread!   Service was great here- the servers are very attentive and come by often (but not too often!) to check up on you.",

    "text": "My husband and I had been looking forward to this meal since seeing it on an episode with Andrew Zimmerman. My husband is from Corfu Greece and I am Italian so we love & enjoy & know Mediterranean fish. Unfortunately we were disappointed on many levels. The main course scorpion fish was over cooked as this fish is meant to be cooked in a stew which we initially asked for but because we wanted the fish whole they wouldn't accommodate us. The risotto dish was over salted and full of butter as was the sauce for our whole fish. Butter should not replace olive oil in cooking fish from this area. Perhaps this is done to try to accommodate an American palate. But I have yet to meet an American who complains of the food when visiting Italy or Greece! It seemed to my husband that the chef is missing the point of how mothers across these countries cook their seafood-each fish is cooked in its own particular way to enhance its flavors- not all can be oven baked. When we saw the chef in the dining area we asked if we could see him. We were told he was busy in the office. We suspect either our bill was not high enough to entice him to our table or he was busy baking all the fish he microchipped over from the Mediterranean. We highly recommend saving your money for a trip to Greece or Italy to learn how fish is supposed to be eaten!",

    "text": "Our first trip to Las Vegas taught us how very hit and miss the dining can be, even in the most classed-up resorts on the strip.  This restaurant was a huge letdown, given that everything else we experienced at Wynn was top shelf.  Our dining companions had made the reservation about a week earlier, and when we went to check in with the hostess, she was first blank, then snotty, informing us that she had no reservation for us...dining companion called up the e-mail on her Blackberry and showed it to the hostess, who got even snottier in the face of their mistake. She told us to come back in a half hour and she'd see if she could work us in (bunch of vacant tables right behind her).  Attitude was both unnecessary and Irritating, but okay, fine, so we went and browsed the neighboring shops in the Wynn Esplanade.      We came back, got the same blank look and snottiness...obviously nothing had been done to set us up with a table.  Snippy hostess disappears, another hostess takes her place, and unceremoniously dumps the five of us up at one of the tables that was vacant the first time we checked in, which is set for ten people.  We were waving to eachother from afar across the table.  SO's dad gets fed up at the treatment, given the cost of the place, and finds a manager to speak with.  Which gets us a more appropriately-sized table on the lower level...shoved in the back, right outside the kitchen door.    Then, the food ordering commences.  Not sure what we expected, but not the limited options available. I don't expect it to be a casino buffet, but the offerings were surprisingly sparse.  I had not chosen or made reservations at the restaurant, so I hadn't done the research I usually do, so fair enough...it was somebody else's pick.  But I think everyone in our party was surprised at the fact that if you didn't order from the bizarrely presented glass case of dead fish on ice that's rolled up to your table, your sole options are side dishes of mediocre pasta, and by side dishes,  I mean about two tablespoons full...and at high-end entree prices.  Nobody was really interested in $75 and up portions of fish.  Guy shoving the case of gaping dead fish into my lap obviously offended that we're all ordering side dishes of pasta, and treatment gets colder, still, despite the ordering of copious amounts of overpriced wine to get through the experience.   And the bill was astronomical for getting basically table wine and sub-Olive Garden saucers of noodles.  The one star is because the mixed greens salad was actually quite good.    Mainly, my beef is with the service/attitudes...and not the food, though, although the presentation is pretty strange and definitely pretentious.  Pretty obscene treatment for a place where a full dinner for five people would cost well upwards of a grand.  Would never recommend the place.",

    "text": "Very expensive but based on my one visit there - worth it. Amazing service. Lovely surroundings. One of the most interesting menus in town. Fresh fish even on Sunday. Our wait staff was extremely polite and attentive. We were treated like kings. Every bite of the food was delicious. If you can afford it, you should visit here at least once. The only negative is it's in a Wynn property. I hate everything Steve Wynn stands for. I hate his politics and the way he treats his people and the way he runs his business. The valet won't leave cars up at any price (only hotel in Vegas with this policy) but all that said - it's worth suffering the indignity of letting Wynn make a few bucks to enjoy the feast that is Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare. I'd give it five stars if it were anywhere else and I'd visit more often too.",

    "text": "We went to Bartolotta for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We had read some of the negative reviews on Yelp and knew that it was expensive but wanted to give it a try - we were not disappointed! It was one of the better meals of my life.   The service was excellent. Our waiter, Luciano, was attentive without being overbearing. He even brought out a special birthday dessert for my girl after we had only mentioned it in passing. We were also waited on by several other staff members who would constantly provide clean silverware and plates, top up our complimentary Pellegrino and ask if we were doing okay.   Great service is important, but what we had really come for was the food. By now everyone knows that Chef Bartolotta is skillful with seafood and they have their fish flown in daily so our expectations were pretty high. Rather than order one of their oven roasted fish - a costly and less exciting option - we ordered a half dozen dishes from their extensive appetizer menu. The sheep's milk ricotta ravioli was rich and creamy and the lobster ragu was delicate. But the real stars for us were the seared scallops and the marinated artichokes. So simple, but so incredible. I will be dreaming of these for years. For dessert we got a trio of gelato and sorbetti that were to die for - the best I've had outside of Italy.  A fantastic experience from start to finish. My biggest recommendation would be to order from the appetizer menu - not only does it provide more variety but does less damage on your wallet. A very special meal!",

    "text": "I went here to celebrate my husband's birthday. We walked down the spiral staircase and outside to sit by the small outdoor pond. It is a very beautiful view for being inside a hotel. It was perfect weather and they had funs running so it stayed cool. Overall, this place is very pricey with small portions but the food is delicious. I had the octopus appetizer which is poached and served with lemon, olive oil, potatoes, and arugula. It was amazing! I had the lasagnette for a pasta appetizer and it was also very tasty with all the different types of seafood in the fresh pasta and a very fresh, light tomato sauce. My husband had the gnocchi in a rich tomato sauce and it was amazing - soft, flavorful, and delicious. Then the people in our party split a turbot and gilthead bream. They were delicious. We tried all the sauces that were not cooked with the fish. My personal favorite was a sauce with fresh tomatoes and basil in it. For dessert I shared an assortment of sorbets, gelato, and ice with my husband. We had the pineapple ice, the lemon and raspberry sorbets, and the banana, nutellla/chocolate, and milk chocolate gelato. My favorites were the lemon sorbet and the banana gelato. All the scoops of ice cream/sorbet/ice were very small and I probably could have eaten them without any help from my husband. The wait staff were all very friendly, personable, and attentive. It was a wonderful place to go for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I was so hyped up to try this restaurant! Just went last to Las Vegas for the very first time ever to celebrate my birthday. And the last day there which was last sunday. I wanted to try out Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare. I did some research about the best restaurants in vegas to try and they always came up and then when i saw the pictures I thought it was beautiful. And the prices looked reasonable so I thought this is a good choice. But then when we get there, it was so odd. NO ONE WAS THERE. I mean the only people that looked like was a waiter & the greeter person that escorts you to your seat. Other than that, there were NO CUSTOMERS whatsoever. Something about that seemed so strange to me. I almost thought they were closed at first. Thats how vacant it was. And the two workers that were in there, were looking at us so desperately like they wanted us to come in so badly so they'd get some business. But we left, because something about a vacant restaurant in the middle of the day it was around 4pm in the afternoon. Something about that seemed strange. To make a long story short, we left and ended up eating at Tao at the Venetian. And they were delicious and had customers. Whats going on with you Bartolotta? Why no customers in the middle of the day?",

    "text": "I will section this off into three things I found needed comment: service, appetizers, our entree.  I ate there last night (Friday).  SERVICE  At the slightest tick of my head or twitch of my eye, the Bartolotta staff was absolutely on it.  Every single person, whether they served my table specifically or not, responded to our every request with grace and resolve.  * I asked for honey with my hot water, and off-handedly mentioned he should bring two so I wouldn't have to bother him for more later...he came back with a somewhat dazzling array of honey jars (4) on a plate with lemons on the fringes.  Hott. * I asked two men by the staircase where the restroom was, and instead of pointing or giving vague directions, one of them walked me practically to the door of the ladies' room. .....however, sometimes the server kept us waiting.  We were seated with no menus and had to wait for them.  We had dessert cleared and had to ask for the check.  Yeah, yeah, leisurely dining, but hey, we had a show to catch down the strip.  APPETIZERS Appetizers get an A, from the selection we had.  Both were careful, measured and small, and of perfect portions.  The meat ravioli's sauce was a bit on the oily side for my taste, but the minced meat inside was delightful and dense.  The gnocchi dish's tomato sauce looked frighteningly dense, but it was creamy and light, topped with a light cheese sprinkling that was just enough to say \"Hello, someone bothered to decorate me.\"  I save the texture for last....let's just say that my love for gnocchi was awakened at Bartolotta, with each little potato dumpling melting in my mouth upon contact like a recurring, ephemeral pasta dream. *Side note: The first gnocchi I ever tried in my life was terrifyingly disgusting, in a cream sauce that actually made me stop eating altogether (ON MY BIRTHDAY.  Dammit, I should have complained that night, huh?).  I can't even remember the name of the place, but it was near the Santa Monica 3rd St Promenade...  ENTREE We shared a simple bass.  Points upon points for presentation -- they cook a whole fish for you and dice it apart on a cart in front of your table, pouring on the tomatoes and juices and side potatoes to craft your dish.  It requires a certain skill to look graceful taking apart a whole fish as a waiter.  I asked for the head as he served us, and I got it on a plate -- yay!  [If you haven't tried it, eat the cheek meat of the fish under the eye.  Tenderest spot on a fish.]  As for my impressions, I will be brief: I was disappointed with the texture (or as I put earlier, ephemeral dreaminess) of the fish meat, and it was not worth the money (about $55 per person for the fish).  Sigh.  So.... in summary (can you tell I had a lot to vent?), I'd go back in a flash for the appetizers...maybe even make an Italian tapas night out of it!  *giggles.*",

    "text": "Okay, I'll be the first to admit that I am not of the tax bracket that enjoys meals frequently at Michelin rated fine dining establishments BUT when a special occasion calls for it I'm usually pleased as punch to drop the extra change on an uber-fab dining experience. We went to Bartolotta for a girlfriend's birthday two weeks ago and let me tell you the decor is GORGEOUS, much of the dining area looks more like private outdoor cabanas (which is where we enjoyed our meal), the service was good, not great, our waiter was friendly but did spill some of my wine on my arm while pouring and had the busboy come back to check on us after the food was delivered to think of it he didn't even handle our payment.  But let's talk about what's really important here - the food. Okay, so the prices on the menu are MORE than intimidating - they charge by the ounce for the fish! And they're whole fish - no room for \"I'd like a 3 ounce serving please\" but it was my friends birthday so we ordered the sole that was served over sauteed spinach - it was only decent - when you figure in the price for the only decent sole ($110) it was really POOR. There were six of us total and we all agreed that the best part of the meal by far was the fantastic Italian desserts - not great news considering this is a SEAFOOD restaurant. One final note, do not order the langastine - they are $15 EACH and smelled like they'd been sitting out too long.",

Well that wasn't the case.   The place is beautiful, but unfortunately that's about it.  There are so many things wrong with this place that I can't list them all here.    I'll just touch on the major points.   After the waiter tried to explain the menu to us I was exhausted !!   He said that the fish was ordered by the ounce, but you had to order it in 3 oz increments.  Also you had to have at least 2 people at your table to order the same fish .   And,  the fish is weighed before it is filleted at the table.   What ??   Yeah I know, we couldn't understand what he was saying either.  Then you have the langoustines  They're between $30 to $40 each and they're not much bigger than a JUMBO shrimp.  Also, they make a big deal about being raised in their own 50,000 gallon tank.  Big deal !!  Even as an appetizer, you need to order 3 or4 of these.  The taste was very bland and nothing special.  I've had better from Costco or SAMs club.    So, after we wait a log time for our apps and very slow service, we get the bill.   They charged us $345 for the Sea Bass !!!    For one fish !!!   Are you kidding me ?   There was enough for two guys to split, that's it. I never heard of any restaurant charging $345 for one filet of fish.  That's insulting !!   Don't waste you time and MONEY with this place.",

    "text": "Bartolotta; ahhhh, what can I say about it?      I had reservations at 7:45pm just the other day and was very excited to try Bartolotta for the first time. Upon arrival, at 7:30pm, we (my wife and I) were greeted very warmly by the beautiful hostesses at the entrance. My wife respectfully requested that we sit at a table next to the glass windows and have a great view of the lake outside. The hostess replied that it would not be a problem and that they will clear a seat for us there. With excitement, we sat at the bar and waited until our designated reservation time arrived.      The bar was elegant and plenty of seats were available for the taking. We decided to sit at the end of the bar closest to the servers station which was a monumental mistake! Sitting there, you experience a front row seat to the inner-workings of the restaurant and the stress levels between the servers and bartender. This began to ruin my initial perception of an upscale restaurant and I began to seriously doubt my decision to eat there. We sat there a little uncomfortable and we snickered with the bartender and made a few quirky remarks to help reduce the tension in the room and evening. Clearly, better training of the staff needs to be addressed!     Finally, our hostess came to our rescue and guided us to our seat. Remember our request to sit at a table next to the glass windows that overlook the lake? That request was ignored despite her confirmation! We could not have sat any farther from the windows. In fact, we didn't even sit on the same floor as the windows. It was as if we asked the hostess, \"Excuse me Madam, I realize that we are dressed very appropriately for the evening, because, you see, we are looking to experience an evening of delight and wonder; however, will you please ignore anything we ask from this point further and seat us at the table closest to the common restrooms in the Casino floor next to the penny slots?\". Needless to say, we were severely disappointed at the selection of our table. I will say that the benefit we got from sitting at that particular table was that it was situated within reaching distance to the servers station where, upon request, we can collect our bill for the night rather quickly and shuffle out the door just as fast!     As we sat and began to become comfortable with the ambient sounds of servers joking with bussers, a Server's Attendant came to our side and introduced our menu for the evening. It was a fine menu with a lot of delicious sounding seafood entrees. After a minute or two, the actual server arrived to explain the menu and SHOW us a display of their fish selection inside of a glass case on a trolley. It was very impressive to see fresh ingredients displayed on ice in a beautiful and respectful way. Most places will show you some dead fish laying lifeless across a cutting board; however, Bartolotta displayed their fish selection tastefully and carefully to make them look like the fish were trained to lay still on a bed of ice.        We finally ordered our three course menu. I won't bore you by listing off every entree in its own paragraph, so, I will just list what I had and what my wife had with a few remarks.  A side note that greatly influence my negative experience, I received a glass of wine that was cracked, badly! So bad, it WILL cut your lip severely! I showed it to the manager and she was very apologetic and replaced it immediately. I can't believe that they did not catch it before giving it to me. After all was said and done, they still charged me for it instead of taking it off my bill. All $16 of it! I should have made a huge fuss!  Appetizers:     1) Handrolled Spaghetti in a Tomato and Basil sauce - The Pasta was cooked al Dente and the sauce was delicious    2) Seafood Risotto - The Risotto was cook al Dente and strong seafood flavors stood out by themselves. Great!  Main Entree:    1) Beef Medallion in a Barbera wine sauce - The beef was cooked medium and was flavorful; however, the steak was a little dry. Overall, a great entree and highly recommend!    2) Seafood stew - Very good! Extremely delicate but full of flavor and seafood!  Dessert:     1) Milk Chocolate Mousse with Espresso Gelato - I really enjoyed this. My wife loved it! Recommend Highly!    2) Lemon Cake w/ Rosemary Gelato - AMAZING! Never had Rosemary gelato but I would kill to have it again! While eating this, I forgot all of our troubles! They should have kept feeding me this. A must have!      Despite the great food, I will not go there again because of the service. It was the pit of my weekend in Vegas.",

Our server was understanding and let us swap out some of the pastas on the menu for others that we were more interested in sampling.  He suggested a fish in tomato sauce that was amazing.  But the ultimate was the dessert.  They brought out like 8 different gelato flavors!  All in all a good meal, and an interesting experience.  Just not really my cup of tea - esp for the $150 we each dropped for the bill! Next time, if we ever go back, will just go for dessert and drinks.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, at best? I hate to give Bartolotta such a low score, especially since my friend is a chef there, but I gotta be honest. I don't know who decided to stick Bartolotta right in the middle of the shops. Sure the view of the fountain is fantastic... if you get seated there. But since it was a slow night they closed the lower levels and we got seated right up front and center--right next to the maitre d poduim with a fantastic view of Oscar De La Renta! The service was attentive and moderately pushy. My guest wanted a single glass of cabernet sauvignon, NOT an entire bottle! Now onto the food...  To start, we ordered the: -Seared scallops: They. were. phenomenal. Exceptionally tender (not tough or chewy), mildly sweet, and full of flavor. They honestly tasted a bit like fine sashimi. We were incredibly low brow that night and scraped that plate clean! -Assorted fried Mediterranean fish: We all were mesmerized by the fish cart, but obviously couldn't afford to order every type of fish. We figured having a little bit of each, battered and deep fried, was not a bad trade off. However, much to our dismay, the fried fish turned out to be nothing more than a fried calamari appetizer with a SPECKLING of fish. Not memorable at all.  For our entrees, we ordered the (sorry, forgot the Italian names): -Rack of lamb: *drool* I sampled off my guest's plate ALL night. Even if it's not their specialty, Bartolotta served some rocking lamb. I highly recommend it. -Penne with eggplants and scorpion fish: Is it wrong to say that I liked this dish better 2 hours later when I was eating it out of the leftovers box? I did however LOVE the way the eggplant was cooked. It was sliced thinly and fried into eggplant french fries!!! The pasta itself was pretty delicious, but nothing special. Call it blasphemous, but I felt the scorpion fish tasted like plain ol' tilapia. Meh. -Scallop and seafood risotto: Very rich. Tasted like a mouthful of cream. Skip it.  The bill came out to be around $260 with tip. Definitely would've wanted to spend that money elsewhere since I didn't feel like we got a 5 star meal for this price. Note: My chef friend heads up the fish pastas and HIGHLY recommends the lobster dish with \"rags\" of pasta. If I ever decide to go back, I would order that.",

    "text": "Still in Vegas but had to post a review because really had an unimpressive dinner the other night.  Reservations were made and we were seated promptly.  Service was great and is why I'm giving 3 instead of two stars.  Great wine list although we just got a few wines by the glass.  They were nice enough to give us a taste of each to make sure we liked them.  Started with the sea scallop appetizer which was really good.  My wife got the seafood risotto and I tried it....it reinforced my opinion that if you want good risotto, you should stay home and make it yourself because rarely is restaurant risotto any good....it just takes too much time to make the right way, and restaurants don't have the time so they usually cook it part way then finish it.  I couldn't decide between two pasta entrees so I ordered them both...a seafood lasagnette dish and the spaghetti with lobster.  Both had good flavor but the spaghetti wasn't cooked enough and just didn't taste good....and later I learned it wasn't homemade.  The taste of the sauce and lobster was good but the pasta just ruined it....For $38, and at the freakin' Wynn, why would you serve anything but homemade pasta....it was really disappointing.  The other pasta dish was the seafood lasagnette which was made with fresh pasta and you could absolutely tell the difference.  Pasta was delicious.  The seafood that was mixed in was just okay, and the sauce had good flavor, but overall I wasn't pleased with my meal and left disappointed.  I have been more satisfied with my meal at italian chain restaurants.  With 3 glasses of wine, the bill was about 200 bucks.    They specialize in Mediterranean seafood but my wife and I couldn't agree on a fish, and you typically split a whole fish, which is why we went with our pasta dishes....the fish might be spectacular but they should put an equal amount of energy into their pasta dishes, or take them off the menu.  And please, for Pete's sake, fresh pasta only!  In summary, great service, but the food just doesn't make coming here worth it.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in awhile.  I loved practically every aspect to this place... quality and freshness of the food, menu selection / variety, knowledgeable and attentive service, and a wonderful elegant but not-overly-stuffy atmosphere (esp if you are getting the view of the outside patio area) all make this place worth the price.  Oh, it didn't hurt that the manager hooked us up with delicious desserts and coffee.    As for the main attraction... it's all about the seafood!  If you love fish, there's no way you won't appreciate this place.  They have all sorts of fish including daily / rare specials that you probably won't find on any menus in this country and best of all, the fish is flown in fresh from Italy/ Mediterranean and they prove this freshness factor by laying out the raw fish on a silver tray for all patrons to check out before placing the order.  Our only dismay was when our fish came out, the waiter proceeded to fillet off at least a quarter of the fish... what a waste of a very good and pricey fish (you pay for it by the ounce).  The pasta (we ordered the \"lasagna\", which is not really a lasagna but \"rags\" of pasta strands perfectly cooked with an amazing mushroom sauce) was heavenly, as was the seafood salad appetizer.  The rack of lamb was a solid dish as well.  And the desserts... yum!  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I'm going to review this based on what I can remember as I was in Vegas and well you know....so I gave it 4 stars because the food alone is worth that much but if I noticed the ambiance or the service a little more it would most likely be my first 5 star review.   The decor was nice but unfortunately we didn't get to see the outside patio area...we had a reservation for 7:30 but had to wait for our whole party....for the 10 minutes that we waited we got a drink and chatted up the bartender...he was extremely nice and we asked him to make us a shot he thought we would like...no idea what was in it but it was delicious and it definitely did the job.   the service was good but they were somewhat slow...and hardly came around after our ordering....but this could have been due to our group being a little louder than the usual patrons they see there.   So about the food. They are known for their seafood but I had my heart set on the gnocchi....so my friend and I split the ribeye...an order of gnocchi and the seafood risotto.  For a restaurant that specializes in seafood their ribeye was amazing...i had a foodgasm with every bite as it was so tender and juicy and very very flavorful and cooked to a medium rare perfection. It was huge so even with the hefty price tag it was worth it and 2 people could split it easily.   They did not disappoint me with the gnocchi. It was a very simple dish but the gnocchi was cooked perfectly and with an added dash of freshly ground black pepper I was in heaven.  The risotto also quite good. It was cooked well and the little bits of langoustines, scallops and calamari were fresh and tender.  I wish I could recall more of this dining experience because the food really was fantastic and I'm sure it would have been better if I had 2 or 3 less cocktails that night......",

Our waitress gave us the impression that the pasta appetizer will not be enough for us for dinner and keep pushing for tasting menu. Stupid me to fall for it. Tasting menu has lots of food but I don't think it worth the price. Environment is very intimidating.  Bottom line. Very nice place to impress someone since you are spending big bucks. Otherwise, not recommended for good old italian food.",

Hell, I think you could do better for yourself at the grocery store. The only good part about this place was the cute little food runner we had. We didn't have a server, the manager came by and tried to up sell us on everything, then disappeared after our main course came out. The restaurant was empty and lonely. This place prides itself on rare fish, everything they brought i have had. It lacked creativity and love. All together un-ispired. My boyfriend works for Thomas Keller so we are spoiled, please do yourself a favor, save some cash and go elsewhere. Daniel which right next store is much more fun, upbeat, relaxed and not nearly as expensive, plus you get a server.",

I'm a foodie with money. I eat out 4 plus nights a week. Been to every single restaurant in Vegas multiple times. Bartolotta is a world class experience. Sit outside. $150 a head minimum. Worth every penny. Get the Top Chef menu. Throw in a couple of extra for the table to share like the rabbit in pancetta, pate with white truffles. Sit back. smile like a mad man. The dinner will take three hours. Only the risotto di mare was a disappointment. That's okay when there are 7-8 WOWS! Octopus salad, spiny lobster, pasta with scorpion fish, etc. One of the top 5 meals (for the price) I have had anywhere and I have eaten most everywhere. 4.5 stars. Going back again this week and next. Can't say the same about Picasso, Valentino, Guy Savoy or Atelier Robuchon which are the same price. $300 a head for food/wine tax/tip. Doesn't have to be that pricey. Did a table for 4 with more food than any of us could eat, couple of glasses of wine and a drink for $650 with tip. We were stuffed to the gills...",

    "text": "being from milwaukee the name bartolotta has an emotional attachment -- there are so many great bartolotta establishments in the city.   so when i was in las vegas for business i really wanted to try this place for that reason alone as well as hearing talk that, indeed, the place was great. blah blah blah the fish is flown in every day from under a rock in the middle of the mediterranean etc. etc. noone gets these fish anywhere in the world blah blah blah. i was excited!  i'm sorry to say that while i certainly enjoyed myself i was underwhelmed with the meal -- especially since it cost SO much. i'm very glad i didn't have to pay. and even for free i'm not sure i would go back as there are so many great places to go in vegas. the competition is stiff in town and it seems to me that this place is now on auto-pilot.   FIRST -- getting a reservation.  this was one of the most annoying and insulting parts of the night. i called for a same day reservation realizing that i might not be able to get in OR i would either have to eat at 5 or 10. no big deal. totally expected even though it was a tuesday night and my instincts told me that we could get in. our ideal time would have been 7 or 7:30. when i called i was told 6 p.m. or 8:45. my party did not want to wait so i took the 6 and decided when i get back to the hotel i'll have the concierge call as sometimes tables are reserved for that very purpose. the concierge managed to get 6:30 -- a little better and we really wanted to go so i took it and cancelled the 6 p.m. when we got there the place was empty except for one table. seriously. we were seated in the back right next to the other table with people. annoying. so we proceeded with our meal -- details to come -- and as we spent at least 3 hours there, and spent a bunch of money, only one other table came in. so we could have come at 7 or 7:30 and the fact that we were seated directly next to another party was unnecessary for both tables involved.   SECOND -- the meal. it was OK. there were some delicious moments for sure -- but worth the money? absolutely not. there were four of us who all liked to eat so we decided we would order a million different things and share them so we could taste as much of the menu as possible. this was our choice despite the server heavy-handedly trying to force tasting menus down our throats. some standouts were the grilled octopus salad, the rabbit loin, a risotto i forget but remember it was tasty and the parm-regg custard with wild mushrooms and brussel sprout leaves. we ordered the lasagnette primi that bobby flay raved about on the food network and it was just ok. it wasn't hot for one and didn't seem to have the love in it that it could have. now that i think of it that is the theme. no love in the food. AUTOPILOT. and you can tell the difference. we also ordered a whole scorpion fish that again was fine but not spectacular. NO LOVE!  THIRD -- the wine. they have a great wine list albeit it completely overpriced. and we drank some good bottles. unfortunately the server didn't seem to know that much about the wines i was interested in so i picked between two finalists and it was delicious. white burgundy. it wasn't until we switched to red that i was informed there was a sommelier who could help me out. if i recall correctly his name is gordon -- and he was fantastic! he picked a red that went with about 10 different dishes and i wish he would have been around to advise with the first bottle. and stupid me forgot what the red was he chose because it was so unique, flexible and delicious i want to find it. oh well.  when i travel (or not) and eat at very expensive restaurants i want to see value in it. meaning the food should be so great that i don't care how much it costs. and i'm willing to pay. this was a case when there was no emotional, culinary or financial value for the money and it totally bummed me out! i was routing for the home team.   back to lake park bistro! or bacchus!",

We ordered the grilled octopus for appetizer, definitely one of our favorites; many many high end restaurants have this on their menu but I have to say this place is the top on my list. The octopus is so tender and flavorful, cannot go wrong with this. We also ordered he short rib rigatoni, filet to share, and fresh fish to share. The fish was a European white fish similar to that of bass/branzino, it was carved and served next to our table.  Steak was tender and cooked to perfection!  Last part and my favorite was their signature tiramisu, just crazy delicate and crazy delicious. I was in tiramisu heaven!",

I was completely blown away by the outstanding service, the beautiful atmosphere, and the delicious food. This was the epitome of a 5-star experience.  Two of us were celebrating our birthdays the night we went to Costa di Mare. This was mentioned when we made the reservation and they went out of their way to give us one of the nicest tables in the house. The restaurant has extensive indoor dining but we were seated outside beside a beautiful koi pond. Our table had a tent covering and heat lamps for when the sun went down. Even though it was a pretty full house, the table felt very intimate.  Our waiter started by asking if we had any dietary requirements. When I mentioned I was vegetarian, he left and came back with a special vegan/vegetarian menu. I was completely blown away. Normally at restaurants like this I need to cobble a meal together with appetizers and sides. Here I had a full menu to choose from. I found out later that every restaurant at the Wynn and Encore hotels has separate vegan/vegetarian menus. Amazing!  The food and drinks are expensive ($20 cocktails omg) but definitely worth it. Since it was my birthday, I treated myself to an unreal gin cocktail before my meal. I ended up eating a delicious pastry topped with arugula, tomatoes, and vegan ricotta. Y'all, it literally melted in my mouth. This was food heaven! My friends were all blown away by their seafood dishes. Two of the girls ordered a meal for two where the servers cut and served their fish right at the table. Not my jam obviously but it was very cool to see.  Throughout the evening, the service was attentive and pleasant. The server offered helpful suggestions for wine pairings and made sure we were happy with our meals. The crowning moment was when they brought out two \"happy birthday\" desserts for the two of us celebrating birthdays. It was incredibly thoughtful and definitely made our night.",

We eat a plant-based diet, and Wynn is known for its vegan menus being available at every one of its eateries. Thus, we decided this was a good place to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   After being promptly seated, we were welcomed with a personalized anniversary card. And after our water was served and our wine ordered, we were brought a mini artichoke appetizer.   The bread tray was also brought to us, where 2 of 4 of the breads were vegan.  The vegan/vegetarian menu was limited, but a few items on the vegetarian menu were actually vegan, so that was nice.  Note: every course and item was brought to us at a timely pace, and we must have had 3 or 4 waiters assigned to our table. Everything was presented well and impeccably timed.  I ordered the ensalada misto, which was super yummy but had too many tomatoes, to my taste, and I love tomatoes. The whole dish was bright and pretty and incredibly fresh. Just the right size portion.  My husband had the chickpea cakes with artichokes. I tasted it as well,  and it was very nicely spiced. We both enjoyed it. But note, this is the second dish with artichokes, and there were just a couple of hot dishes for appetizers and three for entree choices on the vegan menu.  Next I ordered the risotto with mushrooms. And my husband had the vegan ravioli with mushrooms and artichokes. Note the artichokes again.  My husband's ravioli dish was very tasty and textured but on the salty side. On the other hand, my risotto was nearly tasteless. No spice, salt, pepper, nothing. And no peppers or salts were offered at any point in our dining experience. We didn't ask either only because each dish was nicely spiced, already too salty, or just tasteless and needed far more than salt or pepper.  I reported my dish as tasteless and requested another dish of the ravioli. In the meantime, my husband romantically fed me some of his dish while I waited for mine. My replacement dish arrived in a timely manner and I shared some of mine with him. I was not upset, and they handled the whole thing very well.  Note: the entrees were lacking in color and imaginative presentation. I'd have dressed up the plates with some decorative veggies.  Next, we ordered the vegan dessert plate that included an almond ice cream, chocolate cake, and cherries. We also ordered a  latte and a cognac.   They brought out the dessert and it was stunning with a \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. The cherries were rich, deep dark red, and marinated. The cake was so so, but the ice cream was yummy and round like a tennis ball and dipped in a wonderful hardened dark chocolate and topped with just a little bit of gold leaf. It was presented to us as complimentary, I assume because of the entree issue.  The coffee took a little too long and came out as plain decaf with almond milk on the side. The waiter apologized without prompting as he knew something wasn't quite right. I told him I would love to have it myself and that my husband would still like the latte. In a few minutes the latte arrived with a little dish of three bite-size vegan desserts!  In the end, we received a lot of complimentary items, all without requesting to have them free, including the artichoke appetizer, the dessert platter, the coffee, the latte, and the mini dessert dish.   In addition, the service and ambiance were perfect. Plus, while we didn't request a waterside table, we were seated by a window overlooking the little lake.  Overall, it was a wonderful evening and experience. However, the vegan menu is lacking in imagination. Too much artichoke and mushroom, and I love both. Too salty, in one case, and completely bland in another. Boring presentation without much color.  With some more thought and imagination, this could be an A+ experience for vegans. And I thank the entire staff for making our anniversary beautiful. Thank you!!!!",

    "text": "This place was pretty good, I would give it a 5 stars except I think the portion for price is a little high.  The service was amazing from the minute we walked in until we left. It's as if you have a small little team that's there to take care of all your needs. Our waiter gave great suggestions and answered every question for us maybe even twice.   We started off with the scallop appetizer that just melted in my mouth, I could have eaten that entree as my entire meal. Since I like to treat myself when I'm traveling it wasn't the only thing I had of course!  For the second / main course I did two pasta dosages. The lobster with tomato sauce was amazing I wish I did that as an entire portion. The noodles were just the right consistency for this sauce and the lobster was perfectly cooked full of flavor.  The other dish I got was the pappardelle, which I'm not sure I would get again. The noodles were great but the mushrooms to me had the texture and taste of canned mushroom.  The last course for me was the gelato which was amazing!! I'm a huge gelato fan as this hit the spot for me!",

Antonio, the main server was knowledgeable, attentive, appreciative, and informative about the entire menu and what to expect from our time with them. The sommelier was evenly as informative and attentive as the rest of the wait staff. When he noticed I was struggling with deciding from the extensive list, he was quick to help me make a choice. The remaining staff didn't allow my water or wine glass to ever run dry. They all told us about every course of our tasting menu option that we opted for as it was served to us.   Now onto the food. Again, WOW!!! The family style tasting menu was so inclusive of the most notable parts of the main menu that I do not feel as if there was anything more I need to try or missed out on. The appetizers were unreal and delicious. The pasta was so fresh and obviously made in house. The grilled crustacean add on was totally worth it. The crusted fish entree was out of this universe!   Literally a dining experience that will not be soon forgotten.",

    "text": "This review is not going to be pleasant as our experience was not the best.  First, the place was elegant and high class. When I entered to the restaurant, I was astonished by the interior and friendliness for the front desk girls. No doubt, for interior and welcome staff 5 stars.  Next, we got table downstairs by the window with the cozy view of outside. The first negativity I got from our server. I felt like he was some snobby and pussy. He didn't explain the menu or concept of the restaurant, but they were probably busy because of CES convention. I don't drink much in general and one glass of wine is always enough for me for all evening. We asked for the glasses of wine but server was pushing to get bottle or half of bottle. I felt strange because we stated that my boyfriend drank red and I white. By the way, glass of wine costed 70$- Vegas baby :) besides, the wine wasn't that good too.  We ordered for appetizers scallops and beef carpaccio. Of course, the waiter pushed me to add truffles on my scallops, so I did. In general, I like truffles so it was not big deal. When I was ordering main course- a fish, the waiter again was pushing to add truffles but I declined. I didn't like his attitude at all.  When our appetizers arrived I was pleased by the presentation of the dish. However, when I tasted I disliked my appetizer- it was too salty. I even couldn't finish the scallops. Normally, I would refuse to eat and change to another appetizer, but I couldn't waste the truffles. So I ate as much as I could and I left 30% of the dish. Of course I felt bitter and unsatisfied of my experience because the appetizer costed 100$.  No complaints about main menu- the pasta and fish were delicious. However, we waited for the main dishes for 30 min. We couldn't fully enjoy our meal because we were hurry for the show. Besides, I asked for side plate of pasta, I got full entree plate of pasta. Did I mention that server was pushy?  In the end, we ended up with over 600$ bill + 130$ tip. Then, the server came and explained how the menu worked because the menu was confusing lol. This was just for 2 so-so appetizers- scallops and carpaccio, 3 wine glasses, fish with pasta and mussels with pasta. 700$ dinner could taste better and experience could be better. Honestly, we are not going to return here. Maybe to have drinks but not for dinner. The kitchen was not top notch. The place is overpriced and the servers are pushy. Instead going here, check SW, Mizumi or Sinatra- better service and wonderful food. Waste of money and time.",

Nothing was seasoned appropriately...bland, bland, bland. It was probably one of the worst meals I can ever remember. Do NOT believe these high reviews-these people do not know good food!!

We made reservations a week in advance, had to postpone the reservation by 30 minutes on the day of and staff was accommodating.   Upon arriving we noticed how nice the outside seating was and asked if we could be seated outside, in which we were notified outside seating was all booked for the night. Of course it was. Note to self: be specific about seating when making reservations! No biggie though, we were still excited to eat here!   Pretty much before ordering someone will come by with their seafood cart and go over the selections for the day. Then baskets of bread will come out, which had at least 3 different types of bread and some spreads to go with it. The bread was hot and tasty.   We decided to do family style with selections of fried appetizers, mussels and tomato, caprese, spaghetti, risotto, filet, tiramisu and an assortment of donut delicacies to share. Everything was tasty, staff was attentive even though they didn't talk that much but kept our tables cleaned and refilled our waters, and candy assortments on the house at the end of the meal.   What's great is we got to eat in a very romantic setting with good food and we stayed within budget so I can't complain! =)",

    "text": "Eh, we tried to make last minute reservations on Christmas Eve and couldn't get into SW or The Country Club. I had a decent amount of resort credit to burn and after consulting with the reservationist for Wynn (very helpful, by the way), I decided to book our dinner at Costa di Mare.  We were seated side-by-side at a table for two at the base on the stairs. I didn't enjoy having to twist to the side to talk to my friend. We also felt like it was too much of a people watching table.   Anyway, upon being seated, we were handed the cocktail menu and wine list (no food menus). I honestly don't understand this. How am I supposed to choose a wine without looking at the food options? Service was not very attentive for a $$$$ restaurant and eventually, we flagged down a server to take away our drink menus and bring us food menus.  I didn't really know how big the pasta dishes were and we decided to share two pastas and one main course. We had the \"maccheroni alla chitarra con ricci di mare\" - hand rolled thick spaghetti, sea urchin, crab, tomato, lemon and \"risotto ai frutti di mare \"- risotto, scallops, shrimp, lobster, clams, crab, cuttlefish, octopus. The maccheroni was excellent and came with just enough sea urchin to be rich without overdoing it. I'm a sucker for risotto and this one was light and delicious but if I had to choose one, I'd go for the maccheroni for sure.  We had one order of the lamb chops to share and it was lovely that kitchen had already split the order onto two plates. By the time the lamb came, we had eaten so many carbs (there was also a lot of bread that was served before the pasta even came) and we were both quite full. The lamb was cooked beautifully and I liked the chick pea fries and eggplant that accompanied it. For $58, this was a fairly good value.  I think we would've been fine with just one pasta and one entree for two people.",

We had a party of 14 and were seated in a beautiful private room. Our group were served the $170 level per person dinner not including the drinks. The wine and drinks flowed through out the night and the bill was over $3000 before tip. We were served the following   Starters Burratta with at least 5 choices of bread and bread sticks. The Burratta wad soft and creamy almost like butter.  Grilled langostine and octopus the langostine was excellent like a skinny lobster but the octopus was soft and flavorless  Lobster Penne pasta was perfect with the pasta more on the al dente side with cuts of lobster in a cream sauce.   John Dory fish wad the best of the meal light and delicate.   Grilled steak was very rare had a faint flavor of rosemary was under seasoned.   Dessert was a small light donut with gellato and a vanilla mousse.   Service was excellent. Located in the Wynn was not completely full on last Tuesday night.",

However, while the fish is extremely fresh and cooked to absolute perfection it was very bland tasting to me as was everything else we ordered. We had the appetizer pastas, I was told it was fresh homemade pasta but mine was very hard like pasta from a box and undercooked, not Al Dente, Fresh pasta is never hard and cooks in about a minute or two. The sauce wAs lacking in flavor and when it was served no one came to ask if we wanted grated cheese or fresh pepper. We sat outside which was a bit pricey to do and late (9:30)and they were out langoustines so we were very disappointed. Last but not least, the portions are very very small. Not at all what I expected I wasn't expecting huge family size portions but seriously, this was small, expensive and bland. I wanted to try it, and see what is was all about but I probably would never go back, just wasn't good enough or worth the money.",

The absolute best part about this place is the decor and the service. We sat on the outside along the very pretty lake with floating orbs, and it was probably the prettiest dang place I've ever eaten at. Our two servers showered us with so much attention it almost bordered on weird. They were really cool though.  But I have to say for a  place this elegant and fancy, they would offer vegetarians/vegans something more than pasta. I have a feeling they could cook up something really special. The dessert was amazing and so were my drinks...but their salad and pasta offerings were super basic.  But wow, that setting. It was really frickin pretty. It made for a very special trip with my sister.",

I would have to say that this resto has one of the most comfortable dining areas I've ever been in. The service is top notch. Our waiter first gave us a run down of \"today's catch\" so to speak while actually showing us a mini \"cooler\" of the different kinds of fish and seafood.  We decided on 2 apps and 2 entrees. The grilled octopus was fantastic and tender. It was actually a big portion (around 5-6 pieces) for an app. I was disappointed with the salad at first glance but it actually tasted pretty good. It was good but I think $22 is pretty high for a vegetable only salad. My cuttlefish pasta dish was ok. The seafood in it tasted very fresh however. I thought my wife's seafood spaghetti had better texture and flavor though. Overall, I thought eating here was a great experience and a good place for celebrating a romantic occasion.

However what truly made this experience phenomenal was the service; it was impeccable!!!!! Luciano was knowledgable and kind and made our dinner an experience to remember. He made us feel special and like we were the only people in the restaurant!! I have a gluten allergy and he was able to accommodate this, even with dessert. I would highly recommend this place and if you want to feel like royalty; ask for Luciano!",

    "text": "For the BEST in Ultra Fresh Seafood this is it. The Fish are line caught and flown in fresh everyday from Italy. Computer chips are inserted in fish to monitor the traveling temperature to insure perfection. A marine biologist is on staff to monitor the live tanks. You won't find that kind of care and quality anywhere else.  We tried a number of things since this was a splurge dining here. In general I found everything simplistic but done to perfection.  We were impressed with the priest chokers pasta, the texture was phenomenal. It wasn't fancy only butter and sage with pieces of turbot that melted in your mouth.  For dinner I wanted to try a fish I never had before. You get a whole fish that they sell by weight. The John Dory that they had last night was too big for two people so I picked the Gilthead Sea Bream with the tomatoes, arugula,garlic and red onion. The fish comes out on a cart, then the waiter cleans it and plates it with fresh vegetables and potato. The fish seemed slow cooked and really melted in your mouth. It was so light and fresh and the simple topping just enhanced the fish.  We had to try dessert and I don't get blown away by dessert often but the lemon cake is something YOU MUST TRY if you come here. It was just perfect, The perfect taste of lemon, it oozed lemon, it had crunch on the top and the rosemary gelato tasted so good with it.  Yes it's expensive. You get what you pay for.",

The food itself was good, but falls a little short of how amazing this place could be.  The seafood was extremely fresh and just flown in from what the server said and I believe him. The bottle of wine that we had was delicious. The service as I said was perfect. Unfortunately the food did not taste 5 start worthy. It didn't taste bad, it just didn't taste amazing. I don't think that I was looking for anything in particular to make me say wow with the food, but after the great presentation of the \"fish cart\", and the explanation of the effort that goes into the preparation I just found the food good.  The check was well over a G for just my wife and I, but that's not why it only gets 4 stars. Had the food been just a little tastier they would of gotten 5 stars from me.",

    "text": "some friends and i were in town for a conference and wanted to do a nice dinner while we were there. we selected the wynn since i am a vegetarian and all the restaurants at the wynn have a vegetarian menu.  this seafood restaurant was the only one that had seating available at our desired time.   my friends all did the seafood tasting menu, and the waiter told me that the chef could do a vegetarian tasting as well, so i could have the same experience. below you'll find my thoughts on this tasting menu  course 1 - salads (arugula, caprese, chickpea with rosemary cakes) -the arugula salad was lemony and refreshing. caprese, nothing special. the chickpea was fine, but a little too strong on the rosemary for my liking.  course 2 - minestrone type soup -a little on the bland side (needed some salt) but decent  course 3 - spaghetti with tomato sauce, tortellini w broccolini (sp?), greens, and sundried tomato, mushroom risotto -standard spaghetti nothing special. the tortellini was dry and the flavors didn't seem to work together. the risotto was dry as well. (disclaimer - i took this course to-go and ate later. see my notes below)  course 4 - mushroom tart w wilted greens and tomato -did not eat this (see my notes below)  course 5 - variety of desserts -the best of the 5. my favorite was the pistachio panna cotta.  now. why did i take things to go? well, while the 3rd course was being served i started to have severe nausea. before you ask, no this was not due to overindulgence - i had just taken a few sips from my first glass of wine. i don't know if there was some cross contamination with the food, or the smell of the fish on the table (which has never been an issue in similar situations before-so i suspect the former). i actually had to sit at another table, and then got up and went to the restroom to \"pull the trigger\", so to speak.   after that, i felt 75% better but asked for the 3rd and 4th courses to be packed up so i could enjoy them later. i asked for some ginger ale to help settle my stomach. the wait staff was fully aware of what was going on.   i felt improved enough by the time dessert rolled around to try small bites of a few items. so i took the 3rd and 4th courses home and tried them the next day. my notes on the 3rd course are above - didn't even bother with the 4th, because the mushroom tart had become soggy and unappetizing.  the bill for this meal was high - about $160 if i remember correctly. but the thing that really got to me was the $6 charge for a glass of ginger ale. it was a cocktail type glass and held about 4-6 ounces, if that. considering how much we were paying already, and the fact that i got sick IN THE RESTAURANT, i found this nickel and diming to be very poor form.",

Service was slow and we had to flag down help for service of drinks and water.  Fish did not taste fresh and potatoes were undercooked and hard.  For the price you pay the service and food should have been outstanding. Our $700 will be better spent somewhere else. We complained to the asst manager on duty who said they would make it up to us next time but we said we will never return again. Too many great restaurants in Vegas to waste our money here!",

We had the Top Chef tasting menu and were blown away by several of the dishes.   Of what I remember, my favorite things included the octopus, which was literally the most amazing octopus I've ever had. It was incredibly tender. I also love the rigatoni with seafood! Large pieces of lobster and a light tomato sauce made this dish irresistible.   The Spanish shrimp were also swoon worthy. They were sweet and delicate and melted in my mouth.   We had our ravioli's topped with white truffles because, hey, it's Vegas and if you are going to indulge anywhere, it might as be here. This was my favorite thing of the night and I was practically licking my plate. I think I would have licked the plate if no one were watching :)  Finally the fish we had in a salt crust with zucchini was up there with the best fish I've ever had.   We were soo full but there was still dessert! And I am never one to turn down dessert. An assortment of 3 gelatos, 3 sorbets and 3 granitas nicely made their way to the center of our table. Next was a panna cotta, a rum cake and a lemon cake. The winner was a chocolate cake with banana gelato. Yummy.   I was beyond stuffed but this was one of those times when it's well worth it!",

I really have no other way to describe the quality other than \"meh\". For $24 for a spaghetti appetizer sized portion, it should be different than if I just boiled some I got from the store and threw a couple clams in it. There was no aspect of the food here that was notably good in any way. It was not notably bad though.  Our waiter seemed excellent; however, there were a large number of fish types to choose from and when we sought guidance he kind of just said 'they are all really the same more or less'. I also got the feeling they were just recommending whatever they were trying to get rid of, so we had one of the snappers. It was spongier than it was flaky- I regret not just getting a branzino.  The hostess also was not particularly helpful. We had a reservation and there were a surprisingly large number of open tables, but for some reason it took her over 20 minutes to seat us. I would not recommend the place given the huge number of alternatives in the city.  Atmosphere was beautiful, but the place seemed kind of empty which detracted from that.",

    "text": "Honestly, one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life.  My wife and I recently went here on our honeymoon and had the opportunity to sit outside under the cabana and enjoy the tasting menu.  We did the $165/pp option with the additional optional grilled shellfish option to bring it up to $190/pp.    Atmosphere: 10/10 - Sitting around the little lake with Koi swimming around a duck slowing swimming by was very peaceful and relaxing.  It's also very quiet outside which was super nice.  Service:   10/10 - Outstanding.  Our main waiter Ray along with his team were very attentive, gave us advice when we asked, and took very good care of us.  We told him certain seafood we liked, and he incorporated it into other dishes.  Also, my wife and I did not agree on the sauce for the tableside fish, so he had it prepared 2 ways so we both could enjoy.  He was clearly a master at his craft and an excellent experience.  Food: 12/10 - I know that's not possible, but it was that good.  If you're a seafood lover, this place was unbelievable.  Every single dish of which seemed like 30 of them was better than the next.  We talked the entire next day about which dish was our favorite, but really couldn't decide.  It was perfect.   Price: 8/10 - Spendy, no doubt about it.  Our bill for the 2 of us was over $600, but it was our honeymoon and we went whole hog.  We got their tasting menu, expensive drinks, etc.  Could you get out of there for way less, of course you can.  We just decided to do the holy crap package, and honestly, it was worth it.  I'll probably never be able to afford it again, but it was worth every penny this time.  Overall - Well worth going, and if money is not a concern for you, do the tasting menu outside in the cabana.  It's well worth it!",

Ravioli De Ricotta Con Asparagi  Sheep's milk ricotta ravioli with asparagus . . so fresh, simple, and gorgeous. I love the flavors which reminded me of Tuscany. Red cherry tomatoes, asparagus, and the handmade ravioli with a subtle cheese, nothing is better than that.  2. Pescato Del Giorno Con Carclofi E Origano Oven baked imported Mediterranean fish with artichokes and oregano was definitely one of the best fish dishes I experienced thus far. The picture speaks for itself. It was stunning, very fresh, and the flavors blended well with the simple oregano herbs and artichokes. Perfect balance and a True delight to eat.  3. Milk chocolate mousse, mascarpone cream, Illy caffe espresso gelato My GAWD this was GOOD. It was chocolate heaven bliss. Beautiful, well presented, and absolutely wonderful to eat.  NOTHING TO COMPLAIN about. Service was excellent, ordered a $56 bottle of Sancerre which was decent with our foods, and the presentation and ambiance were amazing. All around a great experience.

He had a couple of helpers who were always there decrumbing the table and taking away empty dishes. It was our first time dining at this restaurant, we were very disappointed with Jardin's service the night before so our expectations were skewed, but were very pleased with a prompt greeting and an explanation of the menu. We chose a bottle of wine from Paso Robles (the wine list was extensive) and it was brought and expertly poured by the wine guy then after the bread lady came around with different breads we sampled a couple seafood pastas off the sharing menu (perfect sized portions!) and shared the seabass, which comes with a side of veggies. The fish is deboned and served table side and so succulent and soft.... the frozen lemoncello finished off the meal delightfully and we were offered a selection of chocolates and candies with the check. Once again, thank you.",

I'm surprised the other ratings aren't higher.  My wife and I ate here for Christmas dinner, 2011.  We were seated upstairs near the back -- we asked not to be seated next to the busy shopping hallway.  It was cozy and romantic.  The decor was classy and beautiful.  The waiter took our drink orders -- Kir Royale for my wife and prosecco for me.  Next, he brought over the case of fish and crustaceans on ice that everyone talks about.  Fascinating presentation:  He explained what each creature was and that they had been swimming in the Mediterranean less than 48 hours before.  He turned us on to the langoustines and branzino (sea bass), so we order those two, along with a lasagnette con ragu di crostacei and corniglio (rabbit) wrapped in pancetta (bacon).  The langoustine came first.  It looked like a giant prawn or a small lobster.  It tasted a like lobster, but sweeter.  It was hard work, but worth the effort.  Some of the loveliest shellfish I've ever had!  Next, the appetizers, the lasagnette was clearly handmade and perfectly tender, however the corniglio was much better:  The salty pancetta was a perfect pair with the tender rabbit meat.  The wilted greens were a lovely accompaniment.  Then came the star of the show:  The whole intact roasted branzino arrived on a cart.  The waiter expertly removed the skin, head and tail, then sliced the flesh and placed it gently on two plates.  My wife asked him to leave her the tail and the head, which he placed on a separate plate.  We had ordered three sauces which arrived in gravy boats -- tomato-olive-caper (my favorite), tomato-garlic, and arugala-vinegrette (my wife's favorite).  The fish was so tender, flaky and tasty.  My wife admitted not expecting it to be so good!  For desert, we ordered the vanilla semifreddo with wine sauce and figs (for me) and pistacchio gelato (for her).  We both agreed the semifreddo was the better - by far - of the two. I ordered a glass of effervescent Moscato D'Asti, and after my wife tried it, she immediately ordered a glass for herself.  Fantastic ending to a magnificent dinner.  We'll definitely be back.  Thank you, Chef Bartolotta!  And Happy New Year!",

    "text": "after much decision, me and my party of four decided to have dinner here.  They offter pasta appetizers which are doubled if you want it as an entree.  the appetizers we had were amazing... seared sea scallops with imported porcini mushrooms, caprese salad, and duck liver mousse with black truffle.  Each dish was amazing..  I highly recommend the first and last.    midway through our appetizers, the alarm in the restaurant went off followed by a continuous LED light that kept on flashing and flashing. ( think of a strobe light at the clubs).  It was horrible.  All the guests in the second floor of the restaurant had to cover their eyes.  sadly we sat right below the light. This went on for 15 minutes.  During that time, none of the waiters or managers came to apologize or say anything about it, but continued on as if there was nothing wrong.  Apart from the blinding light, every 10 seconds there was a voice recorded lady speaking from the speaker that went something like... \"We are trying our best to find out the problem of the situation.  Please wait as we find the reason for this inconvenience.\"  Couldn't they at least turn off the strobe lights???  our entrees finally came and by that time we were all full and wanted to leave.  The manager kept taking away our UNfinished plates! i was so mad!!  this happened to me twice here! One time i was digging in with my fork and he took it away! WTF!   the food here is good, pricey, small portioned and the service is horrible!",

    "text": "FANCY.  My party of 13 gals got our own private room which was BEAUTIFUL and overlooked the glamorous pool outside.  The service was excellent as well.  However:  I opened up the menu and saw $140 for prefix.  Then opened the page again and saw a selection of pastas ranging from $20 - $29.  Then I found out that they were APPETIZERS and if you want an entree portion you have to double the price.  Yikes!  I ended up choosing the $29 chicken.  (You will know I made the big time when I stop putting prices in my Yelp reviews or even caring about prices...but until then, you can assume I am B-R-O-K-E!)  Anyway, the $29 chicken.  It had excellent flavor and I think it was meant to be heavy.  The chicken thigh and breast were cooked with the skin on, and they were put on top of some porcini mushrooms, also heavily drizzled in a heavy sauce.  Great flavor, but again, it was heavy so if you are not used to grease, probably try to stay away from this selection.  This is definitely an interesting restaurant with an interesting selection of fish, but I'll have to come back when I have some more $$.",

Although it's mainly a seafood restaurant they had several vegetarian pasta and salad options for me.  It seems their specialty is whole fish and they bring a cart filled with fresh fish to your table so you can see what you're about to eat.  Great wine list.  Mixed green salad to start was quite good.  For an entree I ordered the gnocchi and honestly though it was some of the best I've ever had.  It would easily compare with gnocchi I've had in NYC.  The desert had a very fancy name and was very aesthetically pleasing.  My girlfriend is still talking about it.  The wait staff was beyond excellent.  They are exactly what you expect from a fancy restaurant : friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  As a side note men have to wear collared shirts and no shorts or sandals.",

One of the best things I've ever ate in my life were the soft shell crabs they serve here. They were bite sized and fried. OMG I actually desire them EVERY DAY, I want to eat them EVERY DAY!  The wine list is very nice and we enjoyed some Nectar Imperiale.  I was at the Wynn for 2 weeks and ate at all the restaurant offerings they had, this place was hands down my favorite! Sinatras, SW, Daniels etc all yummy all top notch, but this was the spot for me, must have hit it up four or five times while I was there.",

The seafood was really fresh and well prepared.  I got the mixed seafood stew and the portion was heafty.  The risotto was done really well (with bits of shrimp) and the home-made ravioli that they rave about was on point as well.  Definitely worth the money to get the dinner/show package.    Also, the ambiance was great - they seated us right by the window so we were able to enjoy the view of the koi pond down below.",

    "text": "I should start by saying that my biggest problem with this restaurant the is price. Our dinner was good and we were served very well.   We were led down to our table by a young guy in a suit. There were many guys in suits. It shocked the crap out of us when one of them started talking into his sleeve like secret service. That was weird. Another guy in a suit wheeled a glass topped case in front of our table and began telling us about the restaurant and the fish specialties. This was one of the weirdest, most awkward dudes I have ever had approach any table in any restaurant. He rambled on and on and on and. . . Finally he left us and the sommelier came around to take our wine order. Then our server came by to find out what we wanted to eat. Through the whole dinner we had the sommelier, two guys in suits (I still don't know what those guys do.), three servers and two bus boys.  It was Valentines Day and we would have liked some more time to spend together.  For food (Yes, I'm gonna' get around to talking about food.) we started with the duck liver mousse and the octopus salad. Both of which were outstanding. The duck liver mousse was unbelievable. It was served with brioche. My girlfriend said that she wanted it for her entree. Perfect texture. The bread brought to the table was very good. It's baked fresh on site in the hotel.   For dinner my girlfriend ordered the fruite di mare with pasta. It was very nice. I ordered the lamb chops. They were served with jus, potatoes, carrots and peas. Really? For $56? Two of the four chops were well cooked past my medium rare order. When I get into the last chop I realize they gave me the end cut. Why would you give me the end cut if I ordered medium rare? For $56.   We sampled a few desserts. One of them was a lemon tart with tuille cookie over the top. It was served with a rosemary ice cream and balsamic reduction. As we ate through the tart we realized there was lemon curd in the center that flowed out when we cut into it. Very nice. We were served samples of three gelatos, three sorbets and three granites. All of which were very good.   Again, the dinner was very good besides it being somewhat pedestrian, the restaurant was beautiful and we were treated very well. It just seemed like a lot of money to pay for food that wasn't outstanding.",

My sister and I walked in just wanting a drink, so we sat at the bar and after like 2 beers we got hungry so we decided to stay. The bartender/waiter was so nice. He was an older man kind of like dad status. He took care of us making us feel at home.   ANTIPAST DI MARE (seafood appetizer)          SAUTE DI VONGOLE 18.00                     I just have to say wow, the sauce made the dish. Had to keep dipping the bread in it til it was all gone and still I wanted more.  ANTIPASTI ALLA GRIGLIA ~ grilled appetizers               ARAGOSTA... Mediterranean spiny lobster 20 .00/100g                     the lobster with it's smokey taste and the richness of the meat, we just had to order more after we at one each. (MY FAVORITE DISH) PRIMI DI MARE ~ seafood appetizer pasta            lasagnette con ragu di crostacei....\"rags\" of pasta, lobster, shrimp, crab, white wine, tomato 28.00          The pasta was made there, the tomatoes were ripe and juicey. The plate was pretty small though, but full of flavor.  PESCE - WHOLE FISH - 15.00 per 100 grams (approximately 3 ounces.)           we had the Turbo, which was melt in your mouth o so good.  My overall experience was memorable. Would i go there again? absolutely. The food was worth the price and I would go there again and again just to sit at the bar and eat Spiney Lobster all day if I could.",

I started with the steak tartare which was excellent, and then had- the lasgna (pasta rags with different types of seafood) which was also excellent.  My wife had the risotto which she really enjoyed.  Unfortunately the part that I remember best is that for the first half hour we were there, they blared bad Italian pop music (is there any other kind?) at a loud volume.  Eventually they turned it down and put on better music, but a restaurant with such prices and aspirations should know better.",

    "text": "I was taken here for my birthday dinner by my wife while we vacationed in Las Vegas. I was offered a choice to go to this place or another, so I researched this place by coming to Yelp.  Frankly, after reading a couple of the reviews I was a little hesitant to pick this place. Still I did and I will be honest that I don't regret doing so.  We sat outside on the pond, which in my opinion is the only place worth sitting in this restaurant. It was the perfect setting for a nice romantic meal. The interior of the restaurant didn't leave me too impressed.  I will agree that the whole fresh seafood from the Mediterranean angle didn't do much for me, but the seafood was fresh and cooked well.  I had the spiny lobster which has a lighter head and more meat, thus giving you the most band for your buck. It was cooked really well and I enjoyed every scrumptious bite.  The appetizers were good and the deserts were excellent. My personal favorite was the Budino di cioccolatie banana.  Since so many Yelpers have gone into so much detail regarding the food, I am keeping my review simple. The food is good and this place is worth checking out. Sure there is an air of arrogance in the wait staff, but they are helpful and friendly if you get the right person. Sit outside and be prepared to spend some serious cash. It is worth it!",

I'll have to agree with the first reviewer in that Bartolotta doesn't lend a sense it's ripped somebody else's style.  It's very much itself, with an understated taste (I feel like I'm using this word to death today), kind and obliging manners from the waiters, and a meal just fine enough to set things over the top.",

We were seated upstairs, which had less ambience than Parasol Up, the high-traffic albeit somewhat posh lobby bar down the hall.  Noisy and a constant parade of the Jersey Shore crowd headed to XS and Tryst. No offense, but a bit chav-tastic for dinnertime. And this is Vegas....  We were seated at 8:45 on a Friday night. Server informed us they were already sold out of langoustine, the signature dish. Really? After we pestered him twice to inquire, sure enough they were able to come up with six for our table. This defies logic. Maybe because we said, \"We came for the langoustine.\" Who knows?  The langoustine didn't disappoint. Everything you've heard and more. I cannot come up with the words to do it justice. That crustacean didn't die in vain. There, I've said it.  Proceeded on to entrees. Three of us had the red snapper special, two split the red snapper on the regular menu, and one conscientious objector had the filet. I was among those who had the special. Looks 10, dance 3. Beautiful presentation, ahhhmazing sauce, fishy fish. Coulda, shoulda, woulda had the sea bass.  I'm not a dessert eater, but my dining parters raved about the gelato and sorbets.  Bottom line, by all means go and experience the wonder that is the langoustine. But there are better places in Vegas for the rest. Though I die a little inside saying it, I won't be back.

I doubt they will keep the dish on the menu because my luck has always been that they drop things I really like.  I made the mistake of sharing the appetizer with my fiance.  I had a bit of the lobster spaghetti and for a split second I though \"well do I really love her enough to let her continue eating that portion I just gave her.\"  Apparently my good angel on my shoulder was on his game because I am still with her....but for a second there it was 50/50.

    "text": "If I was feeling generous I'd grade it a C.  We arrived at 8.05 for an 8.15 reservation.  Since we had just arrived from Philly we asked if it would be possible to be seated a few minutes early - we were told no even though one side of the room was empty.  She glanced at the bar and as it was full she told us to go wander around -- not a great start.  Once they were ready for us they sat us at a terrible table - right at the bottom of the stairs and next to the wine station.  We moved to a slightly better table, but were told that the decent tables were reserved - I guess the fact that we had a reservation and had asked for a window table did not matter.  The service was polite but slow and a bit inept.  They filled my half-full margaretta glass with water.  When I mentioned it they grabbed the glass - I figured to replace it, but not so - my drink was gone.  The menu was a bit of a mess -way too complicated.  They also specialize in Mediterranean fish,, but they sell them by the gram (how many Americans have a feel for just what a gram is?) but some fish were only available for two or more people.  This was way too much trouble to figure out.  Dinner was just average - since the only seafood that I wanted was for 3 and no one else was interested I had chicken- not bad, but a disappointment as I was hoping for exotic seafood.  The others in my party felt the same way though my father only ate about 4 bites of his risotto and the waitstaff never even asked if he liked it - when you see an almost untouched plate the waiter needs to at least ask.  So - it was an adequate though unspectacular dinner, with one huge exception - the size of the check was quite spectacular.",

Without further ado...  Simply put, Bartolotta is absolutely fantastic.  This is a gorgeous restaurant with top-notch service. The waiters not only know the menu like the back of their hand, they can eloquently craft (and tell!) the story of how your dinner made its way to the table.  Sure, it's a 4-dollar sign establishment, but it's also 5-stars when it comes to taste and service. One of the dishes consisted of half a dozen shrimp, imported directly from Italy (I think they're called \"gamberi\"?). Another dish was the gnocchi of the day...with a house-made creamy vodka marinara sauce. YUM.   Oh...and sitting next to 6 NBA players helped too. :) Now I can say that me and DWill go WAY back. :)",

    "text": "My BF was raving about this place, so as expected I was pretty excited to go to our  Vegas trip this past Memorial wkend.  This place could easily be 5 stars, but if one has reservations and still has to wait, then it automatically gets a 1 star deduction in my book. Other than the painful wait, this place was fabulous.  My favorite type of food is sushi or seafood.  My BF favorite is Italian, so this place was perfect for us.  We started off with the ususal... a bottle of red delectable wine to start. Our outstanding waiter with his Italian accent was very friendly and attentive. Bread with creamy sinful European butter was served. We had my favorite salad... arugala. Our appetizer looked like a small version of a lobster... but it was simply a large shrimp cut in half that looked and tasted amazing.  We had something else before our main course, but I can't remember now... I just remember loving every bite of everything he ordered.  Our main entree was the branzino.  They were out of the smaller fish so they brought us the large for the price of a small, so our waiter says.   OMG let me just say I was in Italy last month, and this Branzino was so flavorful and reminded me how badly I want to go back to Italy. Hands down this was one of the best if not The best branzino that I've ever had.  I'm craving it so much as I'm writing this review!  We were completely satiated that we could not even think of desert. So again this place is overall great, but just didn't like having to stand in the foyer in skimpy dress and stiletto heels waiting 30+ minutes for a reserved table. And thank God for my generous BF, the menu was way over my budget for a meal.",

Overpriced and under proportioned entrees and a hefty corkage fee makes this an unpleasant, unsatisfying venue for dinner. We did not get the chance to sit outside as the patio was closed for winter.  Hello, no heat warmers?    Unless you have tons of money to burn and a not so huge appetite - do not go here!  The thought of paying so much money for so little in return makes you feel robbed.  As for the cuisine, it would of been more enjoyable if I had more to feast on.  I ordered the Lasagnet and my sister had the Riso mare while my brother in law ordered the rack of lamb.   It's not worth going into any details of the restaurant.    2 stars for Bartolotta - at least they gave us extra bread.  Disappointing.",

This is not a place to go when you are reading the prices on the menu, it is EXPENSIVE ... live with it and relish it. I think any negative review has to be taken with a grain of salt .. this place is so amazing in presentation and quality. Let's start with the seafood - flown in fresh each day from the Med. Prepared by consummate experts and presented with enjoyment and elegance. Want a sense of what it would be like to be a judge on Iron Chef, only with more than you can possibly eat in one sitting? This is it. The spectacular finale was the desserts (and I know the table next to us had the same spread for 4 that we had for the two of us - 12 different desserts ... all equally magnificent. Go, enjoy, treat yourself to the best ... and remember to take a paycheck or more for when it is time for the bill ... worth EVERY PENNY!!!",

    "text": "I have to admit, I have been putting off this review.  I am not sure that my words can do this experience justice.  I almost feel like it is one of those \"you have to try it to understand\" spots.  The restaurant is extremely inviting and gorgeous.  Our waiter was Italian, which totally went with the theme of the night and gave you confidence that he communicated well with Mr. Bartolotta (who is actually in the kitchen).  My only complaint is that the sommilier was too busy.  There should have been more than one so that the wait for wine was not so long.  That is seriously my only complaint, which is not enough to take away from the food.  OMG, the FOOD!!!!!!  Okay, here is the deal - skip the salad and go straight for the pasta to share as an appetizer.  Get a big portion and pass it around the table.  It is not worth filling an ounce of your belly with lettuce because the pastas deliver.  We ordered the lasagnette con ragu di crostacei - \"rags\" of pasta, lobster, shrimp, langoustines, crab, white wine, tomato.  It is an open faced lagasna with fresh seafood fillings.  A serious fan favorite.  We also shared the ravioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana sheep's milk ricotta ravioli, Tuscan pecorino cheese, Marsala wine glaze, which was super rich and delicious.  For dinner, we ordered the fresh fish.  We chose the Orata, which is light white fish and the salsa cruda, a tomato based sauce.  We split the fish among four of us.  We could not finish it.  It does not say on the menu, but the fresh fish option is served with fresh veggies and potatoes.  This is a lot of food but it is divine.  The fish was probably the best fish I have ever had.  Plus, watching them filet it tableside is an experience all of its own.    Yes, it is expensive, but this is Vegas and the Wynn...to quote Paula Abdoul, \"it is what it is.\"  And, personally, I think it was worth every penny (even though I did not pay!).  This was a culinary highlight and I would highly recommend Bartolotta to anyone that does not mind forking over some serious cash for a sensational meal.",

Their gelato at the end was divine as well as the other dessert options that accompanied it. Just a really memorable dining experience with terrific food that makes you savor every bite. **side note: be sure your party is all wearing \"appropriate attire\" - men must be wearing long pants and close toed shoes, FYI!

    "text": "We are in a recession, correct?  So why is that the food portions here are insultingly tiny but the prices are set so high that even hedge fund owners who spend the money dining here would later ask for a bailout? *ZING!*   Inside, this place is VERY NICE.  It's absolutely gorgeous inside with a mood that befits all out class that previously, only former AIG employees could indulge in. And you know it's serious high end when a dress code is strictly enforced.  I'm totally down to spend the money at a nice expensive restaurant, but when the prices are this high , I begin setting really REALLY R-E-A-L-L-Y HIGH expectations on the food.  Especially when the smug waiter kept reminding us that the portions are very small and to really get your food's worth, look to spend minimum $40-60.  We get it.  You want us to blow our cash and go crazy...and tip you mucho.  Just to benchmark, I looked for the cheapest offering. $17 for \"appetizer spaghetti\" and meatsauce?  Double-down for double the portions (That's $34)?  Goddamn, that better be some high-end Kobe beef they put into this shiznet, with fresh-made noodles and sauce 'cuz this place is ballerrrrrr.  I couldn't tell, but there wasn't any baller meat for sure. I admit the noodles tasted good, but for all I know I could very well have been eating Chef Boyardee \"Premium Select\" canned pasta and still be duped.  Seafood? it's fresh but I've had it equally as fresh for much cheapper...c'mon, I'm Asian! If you're gonna con me $100 for seafood, just hand me the fish alive and I'll bite right into it...now THAT's as fresh as things can get.  Service was slow.  We were there for over 2 hours, most of the time waiting.  And even our buffet sessions don't last that long. At least they were friendly.",

    "text": "We had the family style tasting menu - Gran Menu di Mari, $155/person.  It consisted of 5 appetizers, 3 pastas, 2 entrees, and 4 desserts.  For appetizers they brought out: scallops, octopus, fried small silverfish, and 2 types of shrimp.  The scallops were excellent.  The octopus and the silverfish were both good as well.  The pastas were cheese ravioli, lobster penne and risotto. The sheep's milk ricotta ravioli was sooo good.  The best cheese ravioli I've ever had.  The risotto was pretty good as well.  The lobster penne had a piece of lobster meat for each person and the lobster itself was very tasty.  The penne itself was nothing special.  Our entrees consisted of a snapper and ribeye steak.  We were expecting to receive 2 fish for our entrees as it was the Grand Seafood Feast tasting menu.  Our server told us that he selected it for us, but they could take the ribeye back and cook up another fish.  We told them that it was fine (since we were pretty hungry at the point anyways), just that we were expecting 2 fish.  The snapper was excellent and while the steak was very good, after trying both we'd definitely have rather had 2 fish.  As others have mentioned the portions are pretty meager even for a tasting menu.  We actually talked about it after dinner and thought that maybe it was because we had a party of 3 instead of a party of 2 or 4 so they have trouble portioning the food and you end up getting the same amount of food a group of 2 might get.  While overall the service was excellent, it was not perfect.  When we started our dining experience the bus boy would fill our water glasses and would guard against any splashes with a folded napkin, by the end of our meal he had gotten lazy and stopped guarding against the splash.  I noticed this in particular because water splashed onto my father's entree plate.   There was another instance when one of the hostesses was walking behind us, when a couple of other restaurant employees started up a conversation with her which was loud enough to distract me from my party.   Given the price of our meal, these are the kinds of things I expect to be perfect.  At the end of the day, there are a lot of excellent restaurants here in Las Vegas and Bartolotta just falls short compared to the other restaurants in this price range.",

    "text": "2.14.2012  Based upon recommendations from the Concierge we reserved a table for a nice Valentine's Day dinner at Bartolotta. It was a busy evening. There were many people milling at the entry when we arrived. It seems there were a number who waited until the last minute to make dinner plans and were put on a waiting list.  We patiently waited in the long line to get to the front. To avoid the unnecessary waiting of guests with reservations, the restaurant should have simply asked the crowd if there were any people who had reservations, before dealing with those who didn't.  Once checking in, we were escorted down into the restaurant via an attractive spiral staircase. The restaurant is beautiful; well-decorated and designed.  The main room is open with high ceilings, so the noise level is louder than most fine-dining establishments. We were seated in a more private dining room off to the side, which, with its luxurious curtains and large, gold-colored wall candelabras felt a little more intimate.  Service for a restaurant of this caliber was stellar. The staff is friendly but professional. The waiter demonstrated strong knowledge about the food, where it came from, and how it was prepared. I told our waiter upfront that we had tickets to a show afterwards, and the staff remained conscientious throughout our dinner so we could depart in time.  As this restaurant is known for its fresh seafood flown in from the Mediterranean every other day, we both ordered from the wide selection of fish. They come by with a cart displaying the seafood on ice so you can see what you're ordering.   Three staff members attended to us when the meal arrived, expertly carving out the fillets tableside. The fish was cooked well, the meat was moist, sauce flavorful, and the staff made sure there were no bones.  Our meal was delicious.  I have eaten at most of the top restaurants in Vegas, including Alex, Picasso, Michael Mina, Alize, Fleur de Lys, Renoir and more and I must admit that Bartolotta belongs among this upper tier.  The only caution I have for future diners is that it may be wise to ask about prices of items that are not on the menu. There are a lot of \"specials\" and the waiters do a fine job of selling. I'm sure that's part of their job. We were in a hurry that night and could not stay for a long leisurely dinner and skipped ordering a bottle of wine (except a single glass for myself).  The fish is generally sold by weight and you may be charged extra if you consent to recommendations like black Italian truffle sauce & truffle shavings.  Plus, you have no idea, how much your fish will weigh. We were stunned to see a bill for over $400. The restaurant is quick and liberal with their pricing, but it is an expensive place overall.   For example, I recommend you politely let the waiter know that you'll order the fish special as long it doesn't exceed a certain price, because you want to also have desert and coffee later. I'm sure they can work with that.",

    "text": "Two words: HUGELY DISAPPOINTING!  We ordered a drink at the bar and took in the beautiful setting on our way to our outside dining table. I give one star for the setting as it is a beautiful restaurant. Everything declined moving forward. It took a while for our waiter to greet us. He quickly explained the menu and he was friendly but rushed off before we could ask questions. We told him we planned to order a bottle of Barolo and he indicated that he would send the sommelier right over. After 20 minutes, he came back and said she was MIA and he would try to help us. She then stormed to our table and rudely said to all of us \"I told you I was decanting a bottle of wine at another table!\". She quickly reviewed some extremely overpriced bottles and when I inquired about one she mentioned initially as putting on the list herself, she told me she put them all on the list. When my husband asked about which wines she had tried recently, she replied that she had tried all of them. We found her to be extremely rude and arrogant. We settled on a $238 bottle that was good but the mark up was ridiculous. Later, we observed the sommelier yelling at our waiter in front of other guests dining outside. She was literally the rudest and unprofessional sommelier we have ever experienced.  On to the food... we decided to splurge and order the Gran Menu di Mare tasting menu at $155 pp. We thought it was pricey but were looking forward to an outstanding meal with great service. We were sorely disappointed. The appetizers were good but nothing stood out for us. The swordfish was overcooked and was served on something that was so bitter, it was inedible. The pasta dishes were good with the exception of the seafood risotto which was not good. We had been told we would get some tuna and when we asked where it was, we were told that it was minced in the sauce with the swordfish which was awful! We waited quite a while for our main fish dish and once again, were sorely disappointed. It was a whole sea breem and tasted like it had been baked. It was cold by the time it was served to us, mushy and so fishy, it was inedible. The waiter only checked on us one time and inquired as to why I had not eaten the fish and I told him I didn't like it. He quickly said sorry and rushed off and we never saw him again! The desserts weren't even good - nothing was really even sweet. It was the oddest combination of desserts I have ever seen and the only thing that was enjoyable, was the itsy bitsy scoop of coffee gelatto.   Last but not least, the bill arrived to the tune of $600+. It goes on the record as one of the most expensive meals we have ever had and one of the worst as well. We regret not dining at Michael Mina as we loved it in San Francisco and thought we should try something new. What a bad decision that was and we will NEVER go back to Bartolotta.",

There were 4 of us and we had the seafood risotto and some kind of prawn/huge shrimp (can't remember what it was called but one of their specialties) to start.  Fantastic.  We had the sea bream and branzino whole fish which were super fresh and prepared perfectly.  Beautiful restaurant.  As others mentioned, its quite expensive, but aren't they all in Vegas?  Totally worth it.  Hope to go back next time I'm there!",

This is one of the restaurants inside Wynn <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wynnlasvegas.com%2F%23dining%2Fbartolotta%2F&s=227528389e43e500891c3bfde1271bcd74879daba9575120574e63978613f876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wynnlasvegas.com/#dining...</a>  The staff was really nice and we were seated right away even though we did not have a reservation. Their specialty is seafood - most of which flown in daily, majority from Italy and the mediterranean.  They show you the fish cart (fresh of course on ice)-explain where it came from, how they cook it, etc. They also have very good bread - 5 kinds that they serve you prior to your meal order.  If you want a sommelier to help you select your wine, he's there also.  We ordered a pretty good size fish (from Italy) white meat, tender and when it arrived, served table-side:  removed the bones and served it with the richest and smoothest mashed potatoes and fresh, sauteed vegetables.  We had appetizers also prior our meal and both fantastic. The dessert was equally wonderful! I should have taken photos with my iphone so you can see how beautiful they present their food.  This is definitely a place we will go back to when in Vegas - the prices are reasonable.  Great food and great service - that's a winner in my book!",

The best steak I've ever had at a restaurant and this isn't a steakhouse, it's a seafood/Mediterranean / Italian 5 star gourmet palace that serves a steak better than Peter Luger. Simply amazing.",

We had our Aqua Panna to start and then the waitor who was super sweet and funny recommended I get a Peach Bellini and it was AMAZING tasted like pureed peach with champagne. My daughter had a lemonade which she was raving about.  My daughter is a picky eater so we ordered the Lemon Chicken for her and they were kind enough to put the sauce on the side. And it was delicious. We also had scallops for appetizer and they were seared perfectly. My husband had the filet and his friend the lamb and they were also cooked perfectly. I had the pasta w crab, shrimp, and lobster and It was delish.  Also the ambiance is delightful. Such a beautiful dining experience. Cant wait to be back.",

The style and presentation of the various selections we enjoyed were out of sight.  We asked for help in the wine department as our goal was to enjoy all ITALY, not Napa.  The cheese ravioli with balsamic reduction were pretty terrific.  The lobster charcoal grilled with olive oil and lemon was equally great.  The the Branzino with cherry tomatoes was a show stopper as was the Italian John Dory.  You CANNOT MISS at this place.  Start with a great pour from JP at the bar and then down the stairs for some terrific dining.  Oh, and don't forget the homemade gelato.  WOW!",

Initially they refused us entrance because my husband wears a Scottish kilt, they stated that their dress code required a collared shirt and pants. After speaking to more than one manager and the concierge, they allowed us to eat at the bar.  We watched them admit several men in torn and faded jeans and sloppy polo shirts and were pretty upset when they allowed a loud drunk at the bar in a plain t shirt.  The food was very good, and though the bartender was friendly, he knew nothing about the fish on the menu and recommended the special because he could tell us what it was.  I am very allergic to gluten and he told me that their breads were gluten free.  After sending him back twice to check again, he finally confirmed that it was not.  The fish was amazing and the desserts were a perfect ending to a good meal.  The food might bring me back, but I will probably never return or recommend this place because of the service.  If I am paying that much, I expect a little more!",

I'm not sure if we've been unlucky, and been in on off nights, or if the restaurant itself is starting to use lesser product, but for the price tag of a meal, I've been rather disappointed.  I can't really place the point of our disappointment - It was in the food.  It just wasn't as good as in the past.  Maybe there was a pinch less salt.  Maybe the pastas were just a tad over cooked. It's hard to say, aside from, just not being as happy as we have been in the past...  It's too bad.  We used to love this place.",

The highlight was the fish and beef that was final prepared at the tableside and the deserts which were amazing.    All of the seafood was cooked to the correct temperature (none over / under cooked) which is difficult for such a big table.  The main server was exceptional. I think he was even from Italy.  His team was very nice and working hard but just not pros.    The only negative, and this is very minor, was the bus boy kept putting flat water in my soda water even after telling him three times.

    "text": "Having enjoyed several meals at this Italian Seafood specialist, our expectations were extraordinarily high. And for the most part, Chef Paul and his supremely professional delivered. Our group of 12 was seated at perhaps the best location in the entire place-the center cabana by the pool...which allowed us to view the entire restaurant through the glass doors and enjoy a  panoramic view of the poolside restaurant as well.   Our group opted for the top level chef tasting menu which includes a variety of shellfish (and of course the coveted langoustines which are tagged and monitored from ocean to table), a pasta course, the main fish course and a family style dessert tasting. If you've never dined here, pay close attention to the presentation at the beginning. It is obvious they take great care to source their Mediterranean Sea creatures and fly them in over no more than 48hrs. They also stress that the food is not fancy...it is just super fresh and prepared and served in a homey more rustic preparation. That said, your taste buds will sing after feasting on the octopus, scallops, barnacles, shrimp and super sweet langoustines. Our pasta course featured a penne with seafood in a red sauce, a gorgeous pappardelle with mushrooms, the signature cheese ravioli which were so delicate they melt in your mouth and my favorite-a squid ink risotto which was knock your socks off good. I am not a huge fan of pasta in general but it is hard not to appreciate the deft hand and the al Dente preparations here. In case you're still hungry, they filleted sizable John Dory table side which is presented in this beautiful thick salt crust. And boy is that fish flakey white and simply delicious.   The dessert course was really overwhelming but we all forced ourselves to taste a bite of each- sorbetto and gelato, a berry compote panna cotta, an olive oil cake doused in rum, a chocolate mouse of sorts and my pick-the semifreddo on a chocolate cookie crust with a dried prune topping-sensational.   The wine list is impressive and we deferred to the sommelier for some Italian selections. Here is a tip: bottle prices can climb quickly but if you stick with the ones recommended for under $100 each you won't go wrong...promise.   Service was absolutely fantastic. Attentive, knowledgable and friendly. If you appreciate what Chef Paul has done with this exquisite seafood Mecca then the tab shouldn't surprise you. Fabulous food in a gorgeous setting served by the most professional staff..and the portions will absolutely fill your belly. Just don't expect to spend less than $150 at minimum per person for this unique culinary experience. Thank you, Bartolotta for another wonderful dining experience. Wish you would come to NYC!!!",

It was a mildly flavored fish and the texture was coarse-grained. The capers in the \"Salse e condimenti\" complemented the fish perfectly.  Branzino (Sea bass) with Cruda (tomatoes, arugula, garlic, red onion, olive oil, red wine vinegar) - Compared to the Orata, this fish was my favorite! The taste was more subtle and delicate. Not as \"fishy\" as the other fish. The texture was flaky yet very soft and as I like to call it \"melt in your mouth\" good! I highly recommend this fish! The side sauce also enhanced the flavors of the fish without overpowering it.  For dessert we had the Torta Caprese, Semifreddo di Vaniglia Tahitiana, Baba au rhum. I recommend the first two desserts, the latter...not so much. I literally had a cough attack because of the alcohol in the dessert. I felt like I was taking a shot of alcohol.   We ordered more appetizers but honestly they were not that special to even mention. Overall the food was amazing.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant, great service, if you can get a table outside I am highly recommending it. There are a lot of trees on the property which makes the place look beautiful. They fly in fresh seafood from all over the World, so you can truly try some exotic things. Instead of a menu they bring a cart around with fresh seafood and you pick what you want to eat. The bread served complimentary was delicious.  Nice wine selection and there is a full bar as well. The place is pricey but worth every dollar. A must try while in Vegas.",

We decided to give this restaurant and a try and we're glad we did.  The food were amazingly delicious and service were impeccable!  We ordered Maccheroni alla chittara (thick hand rolled spaghetti, sea urchin, crab, tomato and lemon. The spaghetti was fresh and perfectly cooked with chunk of crab meats, fresh tomatoes and sea urchin on the top. The other dish that we ordered is Calamarata con Scorfano (calamarata pasta rings, scorpion fish, eggplants with San Mariano tomato sauce). The pasta rings were cooked perfectly al dente and the chunk of scorpion fish were fresh and firm. Both dishes are delicious! They offered four different kinds of bread to start. We tried the cheese with olive and the truffle bread. The truffle bread are delicious. It's soft and fragrant with chopped truffle.   We ordered chocolate almond cake for dessert and were served their on the house traditional Italian desserts (biscotti, almond cookie and berry jelly).  We highly recommend his restaurant if you're looking for delicious Italian food with nice ambiance and excellent service.",

Me and my 2 kids shared the 40 oz Florentino porterhouse and it was cooked to perfection, by far, the best porterhouse I have ever had. For dessert, my son had the passion mango sorbet, made fresh in-house, my daughter had the Bombolinos and they were melt in your mouth delicious and I had the chocolate hazelnut torte, it was beyond my expectations, baked perfectly, the flavors came together and it wasn't too rich.  Let me tell you about our server Andre, he was beyond helpful, friendly and on point. I couldn't have asked for a better waiter. Darlene was also a wonderful server. All in all, I had the best experience, it was my first time here and certainly won't be my last. Quality, freshness, flavors, I could go on and on but I will end with this. YOU MUST DINE HERE!",

    "text": "It will transport you to Italy (sans the 6,000 mile, $8,500 airfare).  The best, in season seafood, everything sustainably harvested,  direct from Italy, prepared simply, the Italian way.  Want to enjoy simply fried, seasoned with sea salt and a squeeze of lemon, moleche (soft shell crab) straight from the Lagoon in Venice?  You have four short weeks in the middle of of Autumn and again in the Spring.   Raw, sweet, briny ricci (sea urchins) from the pristine waters off Sicilly?  Make plans December through March.   Get the picture?  Note:  This is a composite review based on two visits in 2018.  Tip:  Dine family style where possible (you can try more and it feels more Italian).    Tip:  Focus on the seafood and definitely pass on the \"meat\".    To begin, the mixed crudo tasting is outstanding and showcases the freshness and characteristic flavor of Mediterranean seafood.  Thin strips of tender, sweet cuttlefish, sweet prawns, meaty amberjack and a surprise choice of the chef (usually an oily white flesh fish.  All delicately seasoned, drizzled with olive oil and the lightest kiss of citrus.  The langoustines, perfect.  Cooked from live, there is no degradation in the flesh which remains firm and very sweet with a kiss of oceanic goodness at the finish.   Split, grilled, drizzled with olive oil.  Perfect.    The same is True for the giant red shrimp.  Much more oceanic than Gulf shrimp, huge flavor and sweetness.  The head fat, very rich, briny finishing clean.  The moleche, simply fried.  Crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Pop them in your mouth whole to release the briny, oceanic goodness that finishes clean and sweet.    The charcoal grilled Ligurian octopus and the Roman specialty fiore di zucca (deep fried zucchini flower with fresh anchovies and mozzarella) are both noteworthy and outstanding.  Whole fish in various preparations including salt crust is a specialty of the restaurant.  The selection will change daily.  Zero complaints with an orata (sea beam from Naples).  Moist, perfectly cooked.  The cicala di mara, the smaller relative of the cicala imperiale, another seasonal special, is exceptional.  Texturally, like a cold water lobster but the flavor is far more balanced and delicate.  The lingering sweetness of the typical lobster is replaced by a hard to describe citrus finish.  Clean and elegant.  Those wanting a more upfront lobster flavor should try the imperiale instead.  Both simply split and grilled dressed with olive oil.  Pastas, yes, have not tried any recently.  Service is outstanding, professional but relaxed in the proper Italian way.  Very good Italian centric wine list.  High Vegas resort markup.  Easily one of the top seafood restaurants in the city.",

It was also right by the kitchen so we could see the dishes as they were coming out.   Sampled several dishes to have a fuller experience - calamarata con scorfano, melanzane e pomodoro, ravioli di granseola Veneziana con ragu di crostacei, risotto ai frutti di mare, & the fish special.  All were tasty & nothing really stood out as something that I'd have again.    What did stand out was what neither of us will be having again - the spider ravioli (ravioli di granseola Veneziana con ragu di crostacei) is definitely an acquired taste & not one that either of us enjoyed.  The flavor needed a plate cleanser in between.   Great start to a fantastic trip :)",

    "text": "We decided to live our best lives in Vegas and indulge in the seafood tasting menu! Costa di Mare is a 4-star Forbes Travel Guide restaurant featuring seafood flown in from Italian waters 4 times a week. This was the best meal we had in Vegas at the Wynn!  Food: so good! The tasting menu was amazing with 5 courses and 11 dishes. One my favorite dish in the antipasti di mare course was the Sicilian amberjack crudo which 2 thin slices of fish with a sauce full of basil and garlic. My friend likes the clams which was cooked in a rich yet spicy tomato sauce. The langoustine was amazing! So fresh and grilled to perfection. I thought the ink past would be awful because it reminded me of black bean pasta but it was so fresh and soft, it's flavor surprised me. The fish dish was served with a tomato relish which was so flavorful you can put it on any savory dish and was definitely my favorite sauce. I was a bit disappointed in their symphony of deserts as I was surprised that it included 4 types of donuts. The best desert they gave us was a heavenly lemon desert. The restaurant gave it to us to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was very kind of them. There was so much food that we had to take some back to our hotel room!  Service: excellent! Staff was friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about seafood. They knew the details of every dish served and explained what it included and how it was prepared. The timing of the meal was well planned so we didn't wait long between courses. Our water and coffee was always full. We ordered wine at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.   Price: the meal was very expensive but worth it. We paid a little less than $600 including the tip. I'm all about value so I had to remind myself that the tasting menu was a wonderful experience so I won't complain about the price.   Location: Costa di Mare is located in the Wynn with indoor and outdoor seating. We asked for outdoor seating and sat next to the pond. The hostess said parties of 5 are seated in the cabanas so we were bummed out but our table still had a beautiful view I recommend making a reservation in advance for a table.   Overall, Costi di Mare is good if you're celebrating something special given high prices.",

    "text": "The hostess is the face of any restaurant.  Sadly our first experience at this fine restaurant was beyond subpar when it came to how welcome the hostess made us feel.    We had Thursday 5:30 reservations which is when they open.  Two adults and our 5 year old.  I asked for outside dining.  Were we made to wait at least 10 minutes past opening in an empty restaurant while the hostess was in discussions with other employees.  When she finally came to get us no apologies for the extra wait.  She proceeds to sit us inside while the entire outside seating is still empty.    We sit down, but refrain from asking why we are t getting an outside table like we requested.   After a few minutes I ask the waiter.  He says he will take care of it.  10 minutes later the hostess comes back to our table, looks me straight in the eye and says all the outdoor tables are spoken for (meanwhile they are all empty and I'm more than confident by the time we are done eating many of them still will be). I have no words for her and she just says \"sorry\" and walks away.  Ok now not only do we not feel welcome we are really offended.  We are about to spend a lot of money in this place and it feels like we just got slapped in the face.    Our waiter asked us if we are moving outside and we said \"no\" we assume the hostess doesn't want us outside because we have a 5 year and perhaps they have a rule about not allowing children outside, but we don't know for sure because hostess doesn't have enough respect for her paying guests to just be honest.  The waiter frowned and shook his head.    To his great credit he apparently said something to the head waiter who promptly moved us outside.  He said \"young people just don't get it\" and he was right. Just because we had a child doesn't mean we want to stop living.  We still want to go to nice restaurants and not be forced to eat chicken fingers at Denny's all the time.    The wait staff was beyond amazing and made our night.  Needless to say when we left the outside seating was still more than half empty.    The hostess can learn a thing or two from their waiters on how to make guests feel welcome.   Wine was superior.  Food was an 8 out if 10 in terms of flavor and originality.  For the price I'd encourage them to raise the bar on the food if they want True foodies to be repeat customers.",

    "text": "I give two stars only because where I sat outside with my dining partner was cozy.  All right, so I am confused by this place...bear with me.  I knew about this place for I was staying at the Wynn, and before I got there I looked at all of the restaurants on line beforehand, and the menus.  I heard we were going there, and I thought \"yum..\"  The booth/table we sat at was, in fact cozy.  That was nice.  Going down the stairs to the outside terrace was interesting, and I saw glass boxes with fish on ice in a few places on the way down.  We were greeted with a box of fish on ice with brass trim.  Apparently ALL of the fish in there were flown in fresh from Italy that day.  We started there at about 6:30 pm so that was a long ass flight for the fish, and they made it there just in time for us.  Our waiter was from Napoli, he said, and had an accent, and told us all about the fish, and lobster, and crab and whatnot, and pointed to the (and forgive my spelling) the seabring fish that he ate as a kid in Italy, and how tasty it was.  I have since googled said fish, and I cannot find it anywhere..regardless..I tried spelling it in a few ways.   We ordered a scallop appetizer, and it had mushrooms.  It was good.  We each got a scallop.  We then opted for the whole red snapper, which they sell by the gram.  We shared this.  There were choices of sauces to put on the fish, and we got tomato, and green olive \"sauce\" for the top.  The waiter cut up and de- boned the fish in front of us, and took away the head and bones and all of the skin.  The finished fish on the plate was good, and so was the sauce, and there were potatoes and herbs (I think) on the side.  The meal in and of itself was good.  I have definitely had MUCH better for the prices, and I would have done the sauce differently.  I kept wondering why they threw out the head, and how sometimes, especially in the asian culture, the head goes to the \"head\" of the family..and people eat the whole thing at times.  I hope that all of that excess fish went to a stock or something later on.  So first of all, I have had better.  Second, I am not sure of all the hype flying fish in daily from Italy.  As another reviewer stated, it did seem a bit pretentious for what it actually was, but I suppose it is Vega$, and you get what you pay for, and I suppose that is my third...Don't you hate it when people say \"first\" without backing it up with a \"second or third?\"  Oh yeah, and fourth..what the hell is a seabring fish?  There are better fish places on the planet.  Go to one of those.  I think they mean well, so I do not want to completely bash it.  I had a good time with my dining partner, nevertheless.",

Despite the mixed reviews, we decided to try it out and were extremely impressed with the experience. The fish is flown in daily from Italy-we got the branzino cooked in salt-truly melted in our mouths. The gnocchi was awesome and we also got the artichoke and mushroom salad which was also delicious. The chef/owner came by our table and brought over about 12 homemade gelatos to try. They are all made on their premise daily. Flavors:grapefruit, mango, pink grapefruit ices. pistachio, coffee, chocolate, banana, gianduia, rosemary gelatos-each and every flavor was a piece of heaven. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth every penny. Enjoy!",

    "text": "After the first course, I threw up.    As a huge Top Chef fan, we went to Bartolotta for the Top Chef tasting menu.  First course consisted of five tapas-sized dishes.  The first was an assortment of \"fried\" fish which included soft shell crab, calamari and 90% white fish which we didn't care for.  The ocyopus salad was tasty as were the grilled scallops with mushrooms and parmesan.  Canellini beans with bortaga was tasty.  The clams in  wine sauce were metallic tatsting.  I tried two or three and sent them back suggesting the chef check the dish.  The waiter brought the next couse which consisted of sheeps milk cheese ravioli, squid ink risotto, and two types of pasta.  I had a bite of each and mentioned that the pasta was very undercooked.  The response?  \"That's the way we cook it here.\"  My bite of rissoto was good, but all of the sudden I became nauseaus and had to run to the ladies room.  After about 10 minutes, my husband was presented with a bill.  There was no concern, no apology.  After cleaning  up, I spoke with the manager and questioned how he could charge $200.00 for a meal that literally made someone sick. \"You think it was the food?\" the manager asked.  He ultimately comped the \"meal\" but charged for wine (even though that was left on the table).  I was sick in my room the next day with symptoms of food poisoning.  Cannot recommend.  Nothing was above average even before I got sick.",

We had to wait a while for just about everything from water refills, to drink orders, to even getting our menus.

Every dish was so unique and flavorful! Presentation is gorgeous and portion sizes are more then fair for the price. Our table was seated next to the window so we had a lovely view of the outside lake with all its koi fish and lovely decor. We had multiple servers (making it a little difficult to remember everyone's names) but Antonio and the manger Alberto were both gems and always appeared at just the right moment to clear, remark, poor water etc without being intrusive. Cannot wait to return when the weather warms up and the patio is open.",

Finding a high-class, romantic atmosphere for dinner in Vegas can be TOUGH -- you either dress down for the day or wait til almost midnight to put on heels. This place is perfect for an anniversary or birthday, whether it's just two of you or in a group. It's definitely pricey, but you get what you pay for -- amazing food (seafood is mostly fresh with an italian twist) and the service was probably the best I've experienced anywhere in the world.   If you / your group is planning drinking, definitely book a cabana outside (it's a $150/person minimum). The view is gorgeous and the atmosphere even cozier. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

The octopus salad and sea scallops stand out as being very tasty.  As always, good service, nice atmosphere, and great wine list.

He didn't bring the fish over for display like they are supposed to at this restaurant. And he seamed to forget just about everything we asked for.  And finally the ugly: We ordered Bravo's Top Chef tasting menu. I'm sad to say that most of the items lacked flavor and were very unimpressive. Without going into too much detail, it was a waste of my time.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. There are so many better out there.",

The seafood is freshly imported from Italy and you will find there an array of fish like trilla , live langoustines , live slipper lobsters , fresh red Spanish shrimps called carabineros , the pasta are fresh and home made and the service is extremely attentive to your needs ...   we always request  Maurizio . He's the best !! We choose him to wait on us for his great  personality , he's funny , attentive and prompt and can not wait to impress you with his service and attention which is remarkable nowadays ...  we travel miles to dine there and an evening  without him is absolutely not the same ...",

I also tried the brodetto di pesce all'Abruzzese, which was about $60 and I liked it better than the risotto frutti, but still it was nothing special for that price. It was good, but it wasn't special or unique in anyway. Pretty much I had better tasting Italian food for half the price. I do understand that this is a high end Italian restaurant in the Wynn, so you will have to pay more. I am fine with that, but everything here is just okay.

The waiter pushed me to keep the dressing on as he stated it was a lite dressing. I told him I don't eat oil. I ordered steam vegetables and 2 large red shrimp for $30 each.  The salad came drenched in heavy dressing mixed with Parmesan cheese throughout. I didn't want to complain and be embarrassed so I ate it. It was incredibly heavy. Then came what only can be described as large red Roaches on a plate drenched in some weird red oil. The actual edible part ( if you can say that) was no bigger than a normal large shrimp, not even a jumbo shrimp. Then when I ate it, it was gushy and tasted like I was eating raw shrimp. Gross!!!!  I complained at this point to the manager. Who did take the meal off my bill. I tried to explain to the waiter that when someone orders a salad with dressing on the side or food without oil that he should not argue with a customer and just take the order. I felt like it was falling on deaf ears so I tried to tell the manager. It wasn't just about the outrageous price but the fact the food was not prepared how I ordered it and that the waiter should not improvise on what a client wants. Again I felt it fell on deaf ears. So beware! Eat somewhere else!!",

It is a bit pricy, but the food quality is very good, and they fly all of their seafood over daily from Italy, which is probably no small feat.  Even though their roasted fish seems wonderful, I wasn't quite in the mood for that, and went with their grilled octopus as an appetizer (delicious, soft octopus, grilled perfectly) and followed with their house made fresh spaghettini with shrimp, scallops, small lobsters, clams and a lovely tomato / garlic sauce. I savored every bite. You can order these as \"entree size\" if you want. Honestly, I could have eaten even more, but alas - I did not want to be rude. I rounded out the meal with an espresso and their tiramisu, which was wonderful. So many places have bland, flavorless tiramisu, but not this place! The tiramisu was fluffy and flavorful - perfect to round out the meal.  Overall, a good place to keep on your short list when in Vegas. Less outrageous than the big celebrity chef places, and with excellent quality of ingredients. Would definitely return to enjoy this place again, since they were so friendly, professional, and skilled. Grazie!!",

We ordered the pellegrino, Fiji water ($9.50 each), fiore di zucca, black ink pasta, pappardelle porcini, agnolotti (not burrata raviolis), seafood soup, artichoke salad, risotto and the best stuff there was free!  The breads and the lemon ricotta butter were outstanding. The pappardelle was the worst I have ever had. They didn't even bother making the pasta thin, just thick chunky sheets. Who does that???  The seafood soup was bland, risotto was undercooked, the salad was bitter and unpalatable.  The squid ink pasta was the best and the zucchini.   The raviolis I blame entirely on the awful awful waiter. He didn't explain to us that it wasn't burrata in the traditional sense or that the pasta was also thick skinned.   I've never met anyone so pretentious! Short, bald and pot-bellied. First he came by speaking Italian, \"Prego?\" Without any desire to interpret or be charming. Thankfully I understood him unlike our neighbors. I think he only says this to humiliate who he thinks are unrefined! He started with telling us a story of the restaurant and pulled out a showcase of seafood. I did notice that he didn't do it for everyone. Only those who he thought would order from the extremely expensive choices. He didn't pull out the showcase for our neighbors for example. He NEVER returned at any point in the dinner to ask us how our dinner was or if we needed anything. Not even to deliver the bill! Best part as we were leaving, he pretended not to see us so he didn't have to say goodbye.   The only reason I'm not giving this review a harsher rating is due to one of the hosts: Ivo. What an exquisite human being. He sat us at a special table facing out and big enough for 4 people. He came downstairs to check on us 3 times! What host does that? He also served the free birthday lemon dessert himself with charm and kindness that you would expect from an establishment like this. The other wait staff were also genuinely wonderful. One individual actually sent us home with extra lemon ricotta just because he knew we liked it. Another got our bill because our waiter was too \"busy\" with other people.   By the way, don't go there with slippers. They won't seat you.   I won't return ever except maybe to say hi to Ivo.",

(I'm gonna have to apologize upfront as I can't remember the names of the dishes)  So we had a salad or two and some pasta dishes.. all in all, sub par compared to what you would expect for the price you pay..   Oh and a starter, Fiore de Zucca which I think was under the salad section.. (it's fried veg with ricotta in a gram flour batter.... oh what a delight it was)!  The risotto - was ok  The squid ink pasta - now that was definitely worth the money!  Also.. they offer home made ricotta in olive oil, on the house... now this was amazing.. possibly the best ricotta a man can have.. smooth, tasty, oh man it was so good.. so good that we even got two extra servings to take out!   This place was posh.. overpriced..",

If you want to be seated outside, then you can only make a reservation for either 6:30pm or 9:30pm. Also it's a $150 minimum per person.   The drinks were extremely good! Had a nice kick to them without actually tasting too much alcohol. Cocktails were all about $22 each. Wine was over priced except for the dessert wines. Our waiter had a thick Italian accent that was difficult for us to understand. He came over and explained all of the fish and how it is flown in from Italy daily.   We all chose one to two appetizers each, and then chose an appetizer pasta as our main dish. Dishes are small for the price, but they were all appetizer sizes. The food was good but nothing over the top to wow you. I think you are mostly just paying for the view. I definitely wouldn't recommend taking someone here that doesn't like seafood. I would return again.",

My main course was the porcini mushroom risotto, which was absolutely amazing. I savored every morsel. My appetizer was a warm artichoke heart, porcini mushroom, and arugula salad, which was simple, but so delicious. Our little teaser at the beginning of the meal was a melon, tomato, and almond salad, which was also so good. The Wynn knows how to do vegan fine dining right.

When we made reservation there was no mention of a price minimum.  On the morning of our reservation we received a confirmation call and then were informed of the $150 pp minimum.  Not that it is difficult to achieve, I felt that should have been communicated at the time of reservation.    When we arrived, we were not placed outside but at a table inside next to a window overlooking the outside!!!  If the restaurant had been busy, that would have been one thing but there was only one couple seated outside!!  I was very disappointed and displeased.  The meal... not worth the price!  I started off with the extra large langoustine for $35.  That gave me four tiny bites.  It was very flavorful but not worth the price.  It was like an amuse bouche. My husband had the assorted fried Mediterranean fish.  It was several whole fried mini fish.  He didn't care for this as the bones made it difficult to eat.  Next I had the garganelli freschi al ragu di crostacei and it was delish!!!  I just was I had twice as much!!!   Husband had the Risotto ai frutti di mare and he thought it was very good.    Now for the reason to visit!!  The fish flown in daily!!!  We chose the gilt head sea breem fish.  While it was very tasty, it was not worth the price.    We skipped desert as nothing appealed to us on the menu.  However, being our Anniversary, they did surprise us with a small plate of Flan.  Would we visit again or recommend??? No.  This is an experience restaurant and not such a great one that we would recommend.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful, no matter where you're seated the view is amazing. The first time we ate here we were seated at the outside seating by a lagoon with koi fish. And it was so pretty and very romantic. I would definitely recommend requesting the outdoor seating if you're doing the tasting menu, since you'll be there for at least a couple hours. The tasting menu is great if it's you're first time dining here since you can try a little bit of everything on the menu. It's a lot of food but worth it! Most of the time we come in for a quick dinner and we sit at the bar. The bartenders are very nice and attentive. My favorite pastas are the linguine and clams or the Spaghetti All'astice. They're served in appetizers portions but can be ordered in an entree size. My boyfriend always orders the Fisherman's Stew which has big pieces of lobster, scallops, shrimp, clams and seafood. He's also ordered the filet in Sangiovese wine sauce and loved it. We also love the whole branzino that they prepare for you tableside. For dessert we always do the sorbet and gelato assortment. Our favorites are the banana caramel and salted caramel gelato and the mango and coconut sorbet. Then we always get the tiramisu and the Bomboloni. The Bomboloni is like a fried donut filled with a custard. Depending on the season there's an apple (fall/ winter) or blueberry (spring/summer)compote. The tiramisu here is very light and not too heavy. Even when we order these desserts to go they pack it so perfectly as if we're eating it in the restaurant.",

    "text": "OVERPRICED FOOD It was 7pm and the restaurant was nearly empty, I should have been concerned. I wanted to dine somewhere special and delicious to celebrate my 26th anniversary.  I choose this restaurant because I was staying at the hotel and the ambiance looked nice. The menu in my opinion is very limited and it was extremely pricey.  I ordered 1 langoustine, it was about 4 bites and was $40. Although delicious $40 was excessively expensive.  Also the fish my husband ordered was $160! It was baked very simple and you could choose the sauce.  My husband chose tomatoe sauce. The flavor did not wow us in any way. We were both very disappointed.  We also ordered a seafood pasta appetizer the flavor was good but the pasta was very al dente. The cocktails were good.  For the prices they charge you would think you get a basket of bread for the table but they offer a tray selection and you get to choose 1 bread. Every 30 minutes or so they return and offer another.  During my dining I was offered bread 2 times.  Dinner ended up costing $360 for 2 people, which I wouldn't have minded if the portions were decent and everything was amazing.  I would not dine at this restaurant again.  Too overpriced for what you get and the entree menu selection is very limited.  I highly recommend you go somewhere else!",

You can reserve one of their fancy cabanas for a romantic dinner, which comes with a minimum $150 per person spend.   The restaurant allows kids 5 and over. We did wish to dine in the private cabana but were told that the $150 per person charge applied to kids too :(  So preferred to sit inside, which was awesome! They were pretty busy for a Monday evening.  I was impressed by the assortment of bread, which included their famous truffle bread, to die for!! This was served with house made ricotta cheese, so yumm!! They offer vegetarian and vegan menu which was a blessing for me.   We started with their appetizer pasta, ravioli with Marsala wine glaze, pappardelle with porcini mushrooms,  gnocchi with morel mushrooms and vegan minestrone soup. Everything tasted great was served perfectly hot.  Hubby tried chef special sea bass which was excellent.   The wine selection seemed overpriced, by the glass as well as bottle. Wines that you can get in Costco for under $20, were almost $100!!   I wish they were better staffed. Our server was great but was so busy, the main dining room had maybe 2 servers? He had so many tables, he barely got a chance to check on us. We ordered a bottle of wine but had to pour it ourselves coz he was so busy.   Do not miss dessert! Their Tiramisu is a must try. We paired it with a 20 year old port, a match made in heaven!! My kids tired the assortment of gelato and sorbet which they loved.",

The drink I got had a little bit of tomatoes in it and didn't taste like a Bloody Mary. I loved it!    The bread here was incredible. The Parmesan bread had some olives in it and the truffle oil bread was on point.   The appetizer we got was the chickpea break with lemon in it. It was delicious but a little dry and could've used a sauce.   The spaghetti pomodoro was great and really fresh.    I do think the dishes here were a little pricy for what you were receiving.   Service was great though!",

    "text": "I recently dined at Bartolotta during my stay at the Wynn this past weekend. We had scheduled a reservation well in advance and in spite of some of the reviews on the poor service I was very optimistic.  It was beautifully decorated and the outside cabanas were gorgeous. We had a party of 8 and did not have to wait long for our table which was perfect. We were greeted right away by the somelier and presented with a 59 page binder of their wine list. The restaurant was extremely crowded and the entire dinner took more than 3 hours. There was such a long pause between the appetizer and main entree course that everyone was becomming wrestless and by the time the entree arrived everyone was just over it. My boyfriend and I ordered the Seafood Risotto and Ricotta Ravioli appetizers  which were fantastic! I then ordered an arugula salad with pancetta and balsamic vinegar. I thought it was so so and found the pancetta a bit tough.  Three of us decided to split the fish entree and had it served tableside with a lemon, olive oil and  garlic, marinade. Our waiter did a fabulous job deboning the fish and serving it to the three of us. This was probably one of the best points of our dinner.  I found this restaurant to be upscale Italian and not for everyone. I witnessed a party of 10 men come in, be seated, look at the menu and then get up to walk out. I did enjoy the food overall and had we not had such poor service I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars.",

We were seated outside near the pool with our party of 5 and the massive wine list.  We finally had to flag down our waiter to provide us with food menus as we had already had our cocktails and were ready to choose a wine based on the fish we were going to select.  We were then treated to view the fresh fish flown in from the Med and 3 of our group decided to split the Turbot.  We all had different appetizers and I had tiny clams in a broth that were so tasty I used several pieces of the bread (there were two kinds and very plentiful) to sop up the juice.  I then had an appetizer portion of the Lasagnette of Pasta, Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, White Wine, and Tomato and again, was thrilled at the flavors and delicacy of the dish.  Wine choices were wonderful and the sommelier spent some time with us and was knowledgable and delightful at the same time.  Dessert was not a high point and you could have knocked me over with a feather when out bill came!  Having dined the previous evening at Emeril's (another story, and not so good) we knew that we would be paying for those James Beard Award points, but whew - make sure your next paycheck in unencumbered!",

That was not a big deal until the waiter explained to us that all the fresh fish is sold by the whole fish. There was only one fish that they would do for 1 person. The smallest fish they had that night would have cost me $115! I started with the Parmigiano-Reggiano custard with sauteed mushrooms, quite nice, a savory dish. The I had shrimp raviolis, bad, boring and tasted no better than store bought raviolis. My main was a snapper. It was quite nice but nothing over a 3 star, average as average gets. My wife had gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce which was just average again. Now so many people are giving the place 5 stars and I have no idea why. Yes, it is no olive garden and clearly would be 5 stars compared to that, but when you try to compare this restaurant to the best Italian places in the US (like Wynn sells it as) it fails to even come close. There has to be better places to go. I wish I could suggest somewhere else but I just haven't been in Vegas enough to do so.",

The octopus was flown in and very tender (prepared with olive oil).  We shared the sea bass - which was quite pricey at $135 - was pretty good - but not sure it was worth the money.  Overall, a good experience with great appetizers.  I do knock off a star because the fish was not great (given its price).",

I would never venture in here without my dad, or somebody equally knowledgeable/ slash wealthy. I don't want to go back, but I would not turn down if someone else was paying. We had a wonderful table looking over the rest of the diners and then of course the beautiful windows, but that is despite the point. Drinks.. once again my signature roy rogers, my dad stella. I do not remember if the served bread, nevertheless lets get on to the meal. Gnocchi. oh man their gnocchi is the only reason I would spend money here again. Wow.. everyone must try their fabulous gnocchi. I do not remember what my dad got, but he was pleased. Next I had the lobster. How can you go wrong with lobster... you can. First it was like $60 per ounce or whatever is is they weigh lobster with. I say this is fine and order. You have to order at least 4 of those $60 per... that is $200 my plate alone. ya. if I would of known this ahead of time I would of chose much much differently. I received the ridiculous amount of lobster. had a bite and ugh. NO no no no. I ate it cause I felt bad. I ate $200 lobster because I felt bad. What! that is so wrong. My dad can afford it but I'm a college student. I spend $200 on groceries like a month. Ya needless to say I should of had something else. I'm just so glad I didnt get sick. Our meal was ridiculously overpriced, but my company was good and he loved his meal. For that alone 3 stars.",

We were seated outside over the pool which was nice but it was chilly out, the waitress assured me there were heaters so I sat closer to one so I won't be cold. Well once a group of men came to sit at the table next to me the waitress decided to shut the heat off with out asking us if it was alright and then when I asked y it was turn off her response was well they don't want the heat. Um excuse me is my money not as green as there's?? Shouldn't I have been asked if it was alright to shut it considering I was there first? NO these guys were high rollers and the staff was bending over back wards for them with out putting into consideration the surrounding tables. Then the waitress asked if I wanted her shawl... I was like no way! Then some one else asked if we would change out seats meanwhile our food was right behind them, I said no again. We order a half bottle of wine which was $40 because the full bottles were over priced. We proceeded with a pasta dish with sea food it was tasty but not worth $58 and then we had ordered a fish to split with some sides ONE Mediterranean Branzino $120, I was shocked and then dessert which tasted old to me. In conclusion, I will never be returning to this place again. Overpriced is not the word for an alright meal and rude staff. Don't waste your time.",

They were doing a special \"Taste of Wynn\" menu when we got there that included an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $69/person which is an incredible deal for this place. We had reservations for when they opened at 5:30 because our show started at 7 (Le Reve). We got there early to secure our cabana and they didn't seat us until about 10 minutes after 5:30 (even though we were the first ones). We easily chose our courses and wine, our apps came out right away  and were fantastic (grilled calamari and cheese ravioli). The entrees took FOREVER to get there. It was about 6:15 when they finally came. I was sad to say that I didn't enjoy my selection (scorpion fish in a white wine sauce) and the waiter offered to switch it out for me. We told him that was not necessary because we couldn't wait for another entree to come out after this took so long and we didn't want to be late for our show. He came back a couple minutes later and said he would have my new dish out in 5 minutes and he delivered. So I ended up with the filet  and loved every bite of it. Hubby had the seafood stew (which I sampled as well) and it was fantastic, lots of different seafood from fish, scallops, shrimp, clams, and a very tasty sauce. They couldn't get our desserts out in time and we ended up having to hurry to the show and barely made it in time. I was incredibly happy with our server, but the kitchen really was on the slow side. The atmosphere is unparalleled, but you're paying for it. Expect this to set you back a little, but it is a great experience overall.",

The homemade pasta is superb; it just melts in your mouth and makes you not ever want to eat pasta al dente ever again.

The duck liver pate with white truffles was tasty, as was the beef tar tare (not particularly memorable, but not bad). The menu is all about the fresh fish, which is presented to you ala Morton's steak cart... it's rolled over on a bed of ice. They charge by the gram. Come on... we're in America here, at least put friggin ounces on the menu. I have no idea what 300grams of fish looks like, and I'm not an idiot, I just never measure my cuts of protein in grams. Anyway, as I typically do in places where everything looks amazing, I let the chef select what to cook for me, which ended up being snapper in a wine broth with tomatoes and artichokes. It was light, simple, delicate, and just what I wanted. I would not bust my butt to come back or to bring a friend here, there's just too many outstanding places in Vegas that charge $50-60 a plate to go to before here.",

The seafood was extremely fresh, all the way from the langoustines to the scallops, the lobster, branzino (Mediterranean sea bass), and was cooked just right. However, the dishes were surprisingly bland in terms of flavor, especially for an ultra-high-end Italian restaurant. We had dinner at Twist the night before, and I have to say that Twist's tasting menu was substantially better overall. We really wanted to enjoy this place as we love Italian food, and whereas the food was still good overall, it was not up to the level that we expected given the hype and presentation.",

    "text": "My mom and I had a girl's weekend last week and she was kind enough to take me to Bartolotta.  A foodie friend familiar with all hot spots in Vegas recommended it, and II read many reviews on Yelp before we went.  I had very high expectations about this place and told the waiter this right off the bat.  I was not disappointed.  Neither mom nor I was interested in the dead fish tray.  I wanted to want the fish but it did not appeal.  We started with the Ligurian octopus salad, which was excellent.  If it weren't for the glowing reviews on Yelp I woulnd not have ordered it.   So thank you to everyone out there who takes the time to write these reviews.  Then we had the scallops on the bed of porccini mushrooms- outstanding.  We ordered the sheep's milk ricotta and Tuscan pecorino cheese ravioli.  These were SUBLIME.  Perfection.  I will never, ever look at ravioli the same way.   The other pasta dish we ordered, the lasagne strips with sea food was equally perfect.   We ordered the chocolate cake with pistachio gelato, which was absolutely delicious.  A great end to a fabulous meal.  We opted to order wines by the glass so that we could taste different things.  We had the falanghina, vermentino, and chainti classico.   They were each lovely.  The service was very good.  We were there almost 3 hours and no one rushed us.  Our primary server was difficult to understand at first because he mumbled, but thankfully he perked up as the evening wore on.  Our other server was a delight from start to finish.  Overall a wonderful dinning experience.  Only draw back is the price.  It is crazy expensive.  Four small plates, 1 dessert, and 4 classes of wine (not the most expensive ones on the wines by the glass list) set my mom back about $250.  That's a lot of money, even if it's for great food.",

    "text": "This was the third time I have eaten at Bartolotta. I really have two ratings, a five star for the food and one star for the service. Monday night --not busy, my wife and I were seated at table 43 which is a way out of the way  table with no views of the room even though there were numerous vacant tables the whole time we were there. Was shown the wine list, and the\" wine \"expert\"  showed up fifteen minutes later and we asked for a recommendation on an Italian White. He suggested a wine that he thought very good. Another 15 minutes and he reappeared with a totally different bottle saying he thought it \"drier\" . We acceded to the change and after thirty minutes we finally had something to go with our bread(very good, by the way). Our waiter went through the menu and made suggestions and we ordered octopus as an appetizer and the sea bass as the entree. After some time a different waiter appeared with my appetizer, dropped it in front of me with a \"here you go\". The entree was served by yet another waiter who prepared it table side. When our wines glasses were emptied we refilled them ourselves, with no attention from staff. Yet another waiter asked if we wanted desert. Fine food, mediocre, uncaring service, at an expensive restaurant, with an owner of a hotel (WYNN) who cares about his customers and who would be appalled by our service experience.",

The shellfish dishes were tremendous, everything was fresh and tasty.  However, the main course of salt baked fish (sea bream?)  was unremarkable and overcooked. This was probably due to the amount of time it took to remove the salt and debone the fish before serving.  The fish would have been better grilled and left to the diners to eat family style, but I guess this is the way it\"s done at high end restaurants.  The desserts were plentiful and beautifully presented.   Was it worth $180 per person without wine and cocktails ?   No.",

That's what happens when you order from their wine list, not cheap.  The food was good, definitely an overwhelming place that fits right into Las Vegas.  Though a very nice and posh experience, I would not spend money here, even expense account money as I had to do on my visit this time.  This is just blowing money out the windows, its classic continental fare prepared to excellence but it has no business costing this amount.",

    "text": "In keeping with the whimsical nature of the Wynn Resort, this two-story restaurant is elegantly designed and decorated, with an open, airy feel and special dining outdoors by \"Lake of Dreams\" under cabanas and misters.  Service was a bit stuffy, and we weren't really captivated by the long monologue detailing the seafood that was flown in from all the seas of the Italian Mediterranean and which weights were available.  Nor did we want to see the huge platter of the fresh catch flown in that day.  It became very overwhelming for lunch.  My lunch buddy and I ended up simply ordering a pasta dish with tiger prawns and the lobster salad.  Both were tasty, but did not define our expectations of world-class cuisine from the award-winning chef of Spiaggia in Chicago.  Bartolotta is expensive, but I plan to visit again and try more dishes, including the fish.  Maybe it will earn another star once I'm convinced that flying all this fish in daily is worth the cost.  However, I do recommend that you visit it at least once for its atmosphere and beauty; it's like a jewel in the Wynn crown.",

I could of drank it out of the bottle  and been beyond content with that alone. The flavor was so clean and refreshing which are not words I would typically use to describe  olive oil. Yummy...  I'm not going to lie, it is the most expensive meal we have ever had but would sacrifice a pair of shoes to do it again!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here on a Sunday evening (3/28/10). We had a 7:15 reservation, and they seated us early.   After looking over the menu, we decided we would go for the Gran Menu di Mare for two ( $155/person)  We both enjoy red wine, but aren't terribly knowledgeable, so I asked the waiter to select one. He asked for a price range, and we had the Il Borro 2006 Super Tuscan ($92), which was very good and complemented the meal well (so much so that we finished it far before we were done eating which is very rare.) The sky is the limit on their wine list, BTW, so for more experienced (or flat out baller) customers, prices range from about $50 to well into four figures.  The menu included the following (all items are available on the a la carte menu):  Appetizers - grilled saber fish, radicchio, anchovy sauce  We both thought the fish was just a little overdone. I found the bitterness of the radicchio to be too strong for the mild flavor of the fish, so overall, this was pretty average and our least favorite of the appetizers.  - seared sea scallops with porcini mushrooms  Two scallops, perfectly cooked, served with sauteed mushrooms...delicious  - sauteed tiny clams with tomato sauce, white wine, parsley  A very generous portion of sauteed clams with a nice, fresh flavor. This dish suffered a bit based on the pacing (more on that later.)  - Ligurian octopus salad, olive oil, lemon  Steamed chunks of octopus in a simple dressing. I am not a big fan of octopus, which as often as not is tough and slightly bitter. This particular preparation was fantastic. Fork-tender, but with a good mouth feel. This was the best of the appetizers.  - grilled langoustines  Two grilled langoustines, split in half. There was some kind of a crusting on the body portion that reminded me of thermidor, but not as heavy, while the meat in the tail was simply grilled and seasoned. This dish is not included with the Menu di Paranza, and accounts for a portion of the difference in price.  A minor quibble I had with the pacing here, is that they brought the first four appetizers out at the same time, and the langoustines just a couple of minutes later. We could have been having an eating contest and not gotten through it all before something started getting cold, much less trying to savor what we were eating, and talking about what we liked/didn't like.   Believe me, we can have at it with a fork, and we are definitely not pretentious foodies having a 20-minute discussion on, well, whatever pretentious foodies have 20-minute discussions on, but I'd rather they brought them out 2 at a time and maybe the langoustines last, since that's one of the special items with that menu.  --  Settings are changed here, and fresh, hot plates are brought out for the pasta dishes.  Pasta  - risotto with clams, scallops, lobster, calamari  Perfectly prepared, creamy, and good portions of shellfish such that you get a good combination of flavors in every bite.  - penne with lobster  This is the second difference for this menu...the Menu di Paranza does not have lobster in this dish. If I had to guess, I would say they allot ~2 ounces of lobster per person. The penne and lobster were both cooked well, but the star of this dish is actually the sauce. The sign at the front said no t-shirts, but didn't mention anything about not sopping up this sauce with the bread.  - ricotta ravioli, pecorino, marsala with glaze  Basic (as basic as it gets here) ravioli with two different cheeses. Believe me, it's good, but not \"Wow!\"  Again, reset the table...  Main course - whole sea bream  I wasn't sure which sea bream, specifically (there were two on the menu) but a whole roasted fish is disassembled tableside, and presented with a simple dressing of cherry tomatoes, zucchini, olive oil and just a hint of acid (might be a little bit of lemon juice and vinegar both, not sure.)   The meat was very juicy and very slightly sweet, and overall you can definitely tell that the fish was very fresh (there are no cloudy eyes in the cart when they roll it out to show you the fresh seafood before taking orders.)  This was the second minor quibble I had: I wouldn't have minded being able to choose from some different fish, perhaps even to the point of adjusting the price...I dunno, just a thought.  Table cleared, and you are overwhelmed with dessert!  Dessert_s_ - Ligurian lemon and olive oil cake, rosemary gelato - chocolate almond cake, white chocolate gelato, chocolate sauce - chocolate gelato, raspberry sorbet, not sure which granite  All I'll say about this is, save room!  The staff were very attentive, and our primary server was helpful in answering questions as well as making a wine selection. There is a dress \"suggestion\", but it was loosely enforced. If you're at Venetian, it's an easy walk. Definitely expensive, but worth it for a special occasion!",

The rest of the food was excellent, but the two most memorable notes from the evening were:  1) the ambiance: just a really nice place to have a romantic meal, and 2) the, ahem, hefty price tag.   i really want to put a 5 down, but i'm not sure that (on value) it shouldn't be a 4...",

The appetizers were delicious with such fresh flavors.  I especially liked the sardines with lemon and oil (I've never even tried sardines before and these looked too good to pass up).  The seafood risotto was also excellent.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a real taste of Italy.",

Everything was on point. They even managed to squeeze a table for us to sit outside. They even remembered the request i put in for a small little chocolate cake.",

Received terribly slow service from our head waiter and second waiter, enough to forget his charming accent.  All interaction with service staff was rushed because they offered no time.  Table environment was amazingly comfortable and practical.  Big table space.  Food was super tasty and very savory.  Would've liked to have seen a simpler approach to more of the seafood, though.  Wine prices were nearly double the normal mark-up at a restaurant of this caliber, with no help offered by the somelier or head waiter.  At $200/person, it should be much, much better.  Maybe they had off night?  But then again, these kinds of places shouldn't.",

    "text": "One star because the restaurant is pretty.    This place was such a disappointment.  I didn't want to say it out loud to my boyfriend. who shelled out $500 for dinner for just the two of us, on our last night in Vegas.  We had such a great time in Vegas (other food reviews to come) that this was such a bummer way to end the weekend.    We ordered the Chef's Testing Menu for $145 per person and two half bottles of wine for $60 each.  When it came to the wine, we asked for their opinion, and they had nothing to really say.  We just picked CakeBread cause we know it and like it.  For the meal, it came with four small portions of appetizers, three small portions of pasta, the whole fish, and then some dessert.  The only app I remember was the scallops, because I am obsessed with scallops.  They had a large piece of shaved parmesan on it, was cooked decently, and in some sort of balsamic glaze.  It was ok.  I can't remember the other three.  For the pasta, one was a red sauce rigatoni, one was a cheese ravioli, and I can't remember the third one.  The red sauce rigatoni was completely uneventful and wasn't even worth eating the extra carbs.  The ravs were salty inside and had some more balsamic reduction on top to sweeten them up- eh.  Then came the fish.... it was of mediocre size, she pulled it a part for us, and plated it with a fresh tomato sauce.  It was fresh, the fish was meaty and not fishy... but it was soo ehhhhh (*read* not worth $145 per person!!!).  Desserts were ok, a panna cotta that the bf said was nice, two small spoonfuls of gelato, one of sorbet, and I think a little chocolate cake thing.    In addition, at one point, one of the servers dropped a platter when she was clearing the table- no big deal, it just made a clang but didn't break.... but she was so mortified and looked like she wanted to hide.   I hope she didn't get in trouble for that back in the kitchen or something, but that's the type of place this is.  There was a fall tasting menu, 3 course meal option for $69- I wish that we had opted for that instead, and I still would have left feeling that I overpaid.    There are sooo many other places to eat at in Vegas.  Sorry Wynn, this was such a fail.  Don't go here.",

    "text": "Worst restaurant ever!  I would give it zero stars if possible.  Rude and haughty service.  We called ahead for reservation and when we got there, they had us wait for 10 minutes.  The waiter wanted us to spend the most money and said that the cook is a judge on \"Top Chef\".  He recommended extra large scampi, Ravioli with tuffles, and orata fish with red wine. We got the scampi and orata fish only.  The bread was very hard and cold.  I had to literally gnaw on it.  The scampi meat was mushy and soft, and not firm and crunchy as expected for fresh scampi. The server who filleted the fish asked if I wanted the skin.  I said \"yes please\".  He turned to his partner who was overseeing the sauce and said to him \"normally, people don't want the skin\" in a disdain tone.  I felt offended and insulted. So, I got my fish with the skin on the plate.  I bit into the skin, and there were scales on the skin!  If the skin was not meant to be eaten, then he should not even have asked me if I wanted the skin.  I didn't say anything at the dinner because I was in complete shock and did not want to make a scene.    I felt insulted and robbed for a subpar dinner for two that caused a whomping $230!  I got the run around when I tried to contact the Wynn and after emailing <a href=\"mailto:guestcomments@wynnlasvegas.com\">guestcomments@wynnlasveg...</a>.  I was finally able to talk to a general restaurant supervisor, not the Bartolotta supervisor as they are on vacation for the whole week.  He basically said that this never happened before.  He offered a credit of $230 for Bartolotta dining that expired in 1 year.  He stated that was the only thing that he would offer and that there is no negotiation even if I disagree.  I turned down the offer.  I mean, why would I want to subject myself to the same torture and I most likely won't be returning to Las Vegas within a year.  He won't even acknowledge that it happened or offer an apology.   The worse experience ever!  Avoid at all costs!  Serving SCALES to a guest at fish restaurant is unacceptable and not acknowledging it is worse!",

He suggested Bartolotta...being a good Italian-American, I jumped at the chance. I've been wanting to go here for a while, but the only time I'm really ever in LV is for conferences, work, etc...so not much opportunity to really do anything interesting.  I talked my friend into the bronzini - he ruffles at the \"head of the fish on the plate\" thing - but for anyone that has it, its a marvelous sea bass: absorbing the flavors of anything around it without losing its own character. This was an Italian seafood restaurant, so not having bronzini would probably have been illegal, right?  It came out, the server deboned it at the table perfectly, and it was....stunning. Went perfectly with the Borollo.   The place gets a star removed for the ambiance/decor. The fake rock walls in the lower level, and the over mahogonied upper level really aren't my thing.  I don't know where the rest of you 1-and-2 star folks were eating, but your friends may have taken you to the Olive Garden and told you it was Bartolotta. Here's a hint: if you saw bread sticks in a glass on the table, you weren't where you thought you were.",

I can't recall the exact specifics as we had the tasting menu. It was a lot of dishes prepared so perfectly there were almost no words for it! I recall the service as exceptional and after our meal Chef Bartolotta stopped by the table and talked a bit about the dishes. It was well worth the $500 price tag. This time.... absolutely not. Everything about the restaurant felt different. The service was okay. But not what you'd expect at that level. I found myself looking around for someone several times. There was a long lag between dishes on the tasting menu (which didn't happen before).  The big disappointment was the food. It dropped several notches over the years. SEVERAL. My guess is... the chef is off doing a TV show and it's the second or third tier folks in the kitchen. We ate the second night at \"The Lakeside\" in the Wynne and the food was better, the service was better and the price was less than half of what we spent at Bartolotta.",

Although the price listed is 4 $$$$, Bartolotta serves small plates (they recommend you get two per person) which works perfectly for the nice dinner before heavy drinking situation. After our original dinner plans fell through, we called Bartolotta to try and set-up a last minute reservation and our dinner here ended up being better than anything else we could have planned. This place is perfect if you're planning on going out to Tryst or XS after!  Small plate appetizers run for about ~$20 (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wynnlasvegas.com%2Fpdf%2Fbartolottajune08.pdf&s=022fb351b83bc9ad992ab49992df1a10cdeb480fa979c2dcbbc55ea2b96ea3f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wynnlasvegas.com/pdf/bar...</a>) ...and I swear that one will be enough to keep you full  for the night.

    "text": "I heard a lot about Bartolotta so I wanted to dine there for my 23rd birthday. I made a reservation 2 months in advance and requested an outdoor cabana. The hostess said that she couldn't guarantee a cabana, but she would make a note of it. This was pretty understandable to me considering the restaurant is busy, popular and diners like to lounge lagoon side for hours. We show up early for our reservation and I was told that a cabana was not open and that we would have to wait for one and she didn't know how long that would be. I agreed, and headed over to the bar to have drinks. The bartender was very nice and time flew while talking to him. He even named a drink after me!  After over an hour, we were finally seated at a cabana (at 10pm).  So down to business. The food was good, however whether or not it was worth the price is debatable. We dined on beef tartar, seared scallops, spaghetti all scoglio and the pan seared rib-eye. All in all, the food was good, but it wasn't amazing. Perhaps in order to experience amazing, we should have ordered the fresh \"flown in daily from the Mediterranean\" fish (which is $15 for every 3 oz, and I wasn't interested in spending $100 for a fish), or a tasting menu. However, I do expect VERY good for a restaurant like this, considering it s a Michelin rated restaurant. The best part of it was the dessert (and I rarely order dessert at any restaurant because I don't care for it much). They brought out a slice of cake (on the house) for my birthday and pistachio, coffee, and vanilla gelato. The gelato was probably the best I have had. It was perfect in texture, temperature and flavor.   On the upside, I enjoyed the service and the atmosphere was amazing. Bartolotta is great for celebrating a special event, such as a birthday or an anniversary. Be prepared to spend here, for the atmosphere, and definitely request a cabana. I'm not sure what it's like during the day time, but at night it's gorgeous and it really enhances the dining experience.",

The restaurant definitely has a more upscale vibe.  As we were looking over the menu Bartolotta himself was introducing himself to a table next to us. I assumed they were special guests of the casino aka high rollllerrrrss. We ordered the octopus salad, which was phenomenal, the seafood risotto and then the sea bream fish.  I really regret not ordering any of the other pasta dishes, and I'm sure everyone else is kicking me as I'm kicking myself since this IS an Italian restaurant....but next time??  The fish was very tasty and a good portion served for two.  I'm not used to having a firmer fish, maybe cause most Asians like tender, flaky fish, I'm not sure.  But the taste was great. I really liked the sauce that went over it.  I had the panna cotta for dessert and with the fresh assortment of berries, it was delicious.  Service was okay. I felt overshadowed by the other bigger tables and bigger fish - ha! - but what did I expect??",

Classic italian preparation on some of the freshest fish I've ever had in my llife...and I live in NJ. Yes, this restaurant in a state that doesn't border an ocean has some amazing fish which I hear is flown in every morning fresh from the days catch.  If so, that's ridiculous and awesome.  I had a whole snapper prepared simply, yet sinfully. Oil, fresh herbs, garlic, tomato based broth, done. He let the fish speak for itself, and if the fish could speak it would thank the chef for what they did to it's lifeless body.  Ok, I'm getting away from the food now.  Now this isn't for the feint of wallet.  You are looking at $150/person once you factor in apps, and drinks.  Be prepared for that, but it's Vegas, you'll win it back..right?

I don't know how the rest of the world typically orders food, but when I have an ice box wheeled to the table with live fish in it and am asked to choose which I want and guess the cost by weight...I get a little anxious. Thankfully our server was fantastic, knowledgeable and had useful opinions.  We were a table of seven and a few got entrees and the rest of us split two fish: john dory and I believe bronzini. I cannot say enough about how amazing the fish was. If you're going to make the reservation, get all dressed up, and trek to the Wynn...at least do yourself a favor: avoid the entrees here and stick with what they specialize in. It's worth it. Just sitting there digging my fork into a piece of meat I knew was happily swimming in some freezing sea across the world less than a day before is enough to make any girl...well, happy.  Needless to say, we had a $750 bill at the end of the meal. It included a few bottles of not-so-cheap wine, but still goes down as one of the largest tabs I've ever contributed to.",

Atmosphere is lovely - rich contemporary decor, open feel but not too \"exposed\", fantastic patio with private cabanas and nifty reflecting globes in the pond.  Too bad my husband and I were seated at the worst table in the house.  Could we have asked for another?  Sure.  But I didn't spot another 2-top in the house and felt unfair asking for a table for 4 or more on a Saturday night.  I imagined it would work out OK.  I was very wrong.  Constant traffic of other diners coming off the patio, out of sight from waitstaff, tons of servers rattling around in our corner for dishes, glasses, etc.  Very bad.  Next, our waiter.  Nice guy, but what a drag that they push a fresh-fish-under-plexiglass display cart around to every table and give a VERY long, annoying sales pitch to go along with it.  In an establishment like this one if you tell me the fish is flown in fresh every day from the Mediterranean, I'll believe you.  Lose the cart and the sales pitch.  On to the food - we had the tasting menu and the dishes were good.  Fish was very fresh, well prepared, tasty, etc.  Same comment for the pasta.  But nothing was excellent.  Nothing terribly exciting.  Presentation was not nice either.  One exception - the lemon rosemary cake for dessert was quite excellent.  Wine - the wine list was interesting and well priced.  The sommelier, however, was worthless.  We asked for suggestions on Italian wines we weren't familiar with, told her what sort of wines we liked as examples, and she couldn't describe one bottle on the menu beyond telling us that it was \"fun\" or \"versatile\" or \"Mr. Wynn can drink anything he wants and he drinks this one\".  For real?  How about a helpful comment like dry, tannic, fruity, herbaceous, etc.  Service was slow and inattentive overall.  The pacing of food and wine was terrible.  At first, loads of food.  Then no food and a lot of waiting around with empty wine glasses.  Second course arrived and still no wine.  Wine arrived eventually.  Another LONG pause between courses.  Finally, we had to ask for the check 3 times in order to make it to our show on time.  We mentioned our time constraint as soon as we were seated, and they barely got us out of there in 2 hours.  Was it horrible?  I suppose not.  But was in incredibly overpriced and overrated with a heavy dose of annoying service problems as the icing on the cake?  Absolutely.  There are so many better choices in Vegas I have to recommend that you skip this establishment.",

My boyfriend and I cam here to celebrate his birthday weekend.  Our experience was impeccable and above our expectations.  First off, they gave us special seating (and it wasnt even his exact day, but within a day or two).  Everyone greeted us by name when we walked in and said happy birthday to my boyfriend.  The servers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and yes, actually from Italy.  Timing was always perfect.  The sommelier was extremely friendly and helpful (totally unlike our experience at Switch).  The service was happy to work with us and make our experience unique. by working out various options on food and wine to maximize our desires and leave comfortable time to make Le Reve My boyfriend and I had an excellent ravioli dish that could stand alone on it own terms.  But, really the lobster was where its at.  We had two kinds of lobster, but get the slippery rock lobster! It has an especially intense flavor and is incredible succulent.   Our dessert was great, and they even brought out a perfectly decadent chocolate molten cake (it topped many other desserts at other places) for free! Yes, on the house.  And to top it off happy birthday was written on the plate with beautiful and intricate calligraphy like writing.  Really, we could not have had a better experience here. Yes, it was expensive, but well worth it. Next time I am in Vegas, Bartolotta will be on my list of musts!",

    "text": "I tried this place with my husband two weeks ago. The food is delicious, they have the best Mediterranean fish (My husband got half fish, grilled with lemon, tomato capers sauce... soooo Yummy), and their Ravioli was really good, but the langoustines were so tiny and not worth the price. $30 for the Extra Large Langoustine and we barely got one Teaspoon of meat! they are really small as appetizers. Don't recommend. Overall, the ambiance was nice except that we were surrounded by larger parties of 8-10people. Also, the waiter behaved unprofessionally; he was very pushy at the beginning to sell us the Whole fish (Though I'm glad we ended up trying the half fish) and didn't gave us so much attention! He just took the order and never  showed up again to check on us, probably because he was busy with the larger groups! Also, we saw him arguing with other servers :)) It was so funny because we didn't feel that this is 5star service. Anyhow, we would definitely go back for the food.",

    "text": "i usually hate going to 'nice' italian restaurants because ive always seen pasta as rather homey, comfort food. three dishes at bartolotta changed my mind -   gnocchi, carne cruda, lasagnette  not for the faint of heart, bartolotta unapologetically serves seafood for people who love seafood. if you are the type of person that doesnt like fish to be too 'fishy', consider yourself a moron and dont come here.  i dont understand how one takes potato and flour and goes about turning it into a dumpling with the consistency of soft cheese... but after tasting the gnocchi here... i guess its possible. ive had a lot of gnocchi in my day (ex-girlfriend loves the stuff) and this is one of the best.  i dont eat red meat often... but when i saw the carne cruda on the menu i just had to have a taste... and sure enough it was genius... i might never cook meat again and just eat tar tar for the rest of my days. this dish proves that truffle oil makes everything better.  the lasagnette would be one of the dishes at bartolotta that people would either love or hate because if its fishiness. brimming with sweet crab, lobster, shrimp and languostine it was like a seafood explosion in your mouth. it was a seafood pasta dish where the seafood was an actual flavor and not just a texture in a sauce.  my friends and i got a private room, which was nice, and the sommelier proposed a very good chianti for me. the bill wasnt too bad considering we had four bottles of wine and we all left in good spirits.",

[Jan 2009 prices] Don't let the sticker shock fool you.  You get your value filled with wonderful flavors and tastes.   Let's see, 5 appetizers, 3 pastas, one fresh fish, 3 desserts...yep, that's 12 courses.  The portions are allocated in the right sizes so you are not stuffed, yet at the same time, have plenty of room for the three dessert selections!",

Tasting menu was very very bad. Appetizers were some sea food, taste not very fresh and some rissoto not hot enough when it came out and not tasteful enough.   Penne with tomato sauce.... very simple taste. I think my friend can make better than this.  I am serious.  And the main dish was fish with some sauce, taste very bad.  Fish was not as fresh and sauce.... bad.  I am very disappointed with this high price.  I expected more.  Much cheaper Italian restaurant can do better than this.  Because of special event, I chose this restaurant.    But, the dessert at the end, three kind of ice cream, one is grapefruit sherbert , and other two, all taste good. And ice cream is chocolate coating  was really good.  ONLY DESSERT was good.  Lamb was ok. I can have this kind of lamb at other restaurant.   If with this high price restaurant menu, they should make more effort to do better.  Tasting menu is Representative of the restaurant.  When tasting dish came out, the  waiter never explained what they made of.  Only one  waiter who brought dessert explained nicely. This is my honest opinion.",

I ordered the entree size of the lobster spaghetti.....very salty and not the least bit spicy (it was suppose to be in a spicy tomato sauce).....at $60 for an entree, it better be delicious.

My date was unhappy with the quality of her meal too.  Service was mediocre at best, and not up to par for the area.  To be fair, this place's specialty is fish, and neither of us had fish.  So maybe their fish is great.  But if they don't know how to make decent non-fish dishes they should preferably not put them on the menu, or at least discount the cost appropriately.  I will never go back to this place.  I strongly prefer Le Cirque, which doesn't cost much more and is much better at everything (food quality, service, ambiance, etc.)  I'm kind of shocked Bartolotta is still in business after all these years and according to one survey I saw is actually one of the highest grossing restaurants in the city.  I expect most of that revenue is coming for \"first-time\" customers.  Maybe their fish is a lot better than their non-fish dishes, but my experience was bad enough that I would not consider returning.",

They replaced the soft shell crabs with clams - a cheaper sub after claiming the crabs were too small.    The wine list is also very pricey with the cheapest option above $40.

I don't want to knock the service because that was very good (though I feel we were somewhat pushed to order more than was needed) but seriously, what a scam.  One dish was just bad. Pasta was fair and the fish was good but way to expensive (and why not bring the potatoes after they filet the fish so they are at least warm).  Bartolotta was too busy kissing the ass of the people who bought white truffles for 90 bucks a piece, and hanging with the truffle reps to care about what was going on in the kitchen. I wanted to say something to him but ultimately decided against it but am now regretting it.  I usually use Yelp to write about good meals that I've had.  Enough people complain about bad meals.

    "text": "we didn't have the opportunity to pay for dinner, but it's safe to assume you're looking at $100+/person w/o any drinks.  they claim the fish is flown in fresh daily from Italy.  Not sure if Italian fish is better than any other fresh fish, but every restaurant needs their hook.  Our host was from Norway (which is the world's #1 exporter of Salmon), so he knows his fish, and so we followed his lead in ordering a type of snapper that was prepared in salt bake fashion.  i've heard of salt bake dishes, but never tried it before.  I'll tell you i'm a convert.  Salt bake is the way to go.  keeps the fish extremely moist and tender, and imparts the perfect amount of saltiness (the salt crust is on the outside, and the skin protects the salt from becoming over powerful, but the salt crust basically steams the fish inside its own juices).  however, for what i'm guess was about $60/person for the fish, it was a 2 oz. serving.  i'm serious.  a can of tuna would be extremely filling in comparison.  but it was the best 2 oz. of fish i've had.  there was a simple potato side dish which was very tasty and had a nice outside crust.  needless to say i was still starving after dinner (this was a 3 hour business dinner, so there's much more talking than eating), but a great restaurant if you're really into fish and don't mind paying a premium for the experience.",

    "text": "Let's see where to start.  Relatively awful service, we were split across two waiters, one who was very attentive while he was assigned to us for the first 10-15 minutes of our 3 hours there. The follow up waiter was rude, and short with us when he was sporadically paying us attention.  We were a group of 7 adults, yet seemed to be treated like a group of teenagers at Denny's wanting free refills on coffee while loitering for a few hours after school. After about 20 minutes with no refilling of our glasses of the champagne we purchased, we asked a hostess to grab the bottle for us.  She takes it out of the ice bucket and puts it on the table and walks away.  I think it's all part of a picture of how poor the service is there.    So we're off to a bad start, and ultimately those qualities of service could potentially not be factored into the star rating if the food made up for it.  The food was mediocre to bad in most cases, the one exception being the artichoke salad which was tasty and may only be worth pointing out because the rest of our meals were so bad.  My Vegetable Risotto was easily the worst Risotto I've ever had, it was completely underdone with the hull of the rice somewhat crunchy... there was also absolutely no seasoning whatsoever.  I ate a couple of bites and decided to ask for salt and pepper (something you shouldn't need to do at a restaurant of this stature, they should season their food properly), seasoned it myself... took a few more bites and decided it wasn't even worth the digestion.  I chose not to say anything or send it back since it was a birthday party and didn't want to bring attention to it.  The waiter cleared my plate which was mostly untouched and didn't say a word, again the lack of attention or care.  My girlfriend got the Gnocchi in tomato cream sauce, nothing special that I couldn't whip up myself at home without much effort.  We eventually get to the main course where the majority of us decided to have the Branzino.  First of all the cost of the fish by weight is astronomically expensive, but I guess it might be due to the fact that all their fish is flown in from the Mediterranean daily. Don't even get me started on the environmental and sustainability issues that arise from that.  There was an option of accommodating sauces that you could choose from to go with the fish.  I guess I assumed wrong that the fish might be cooked with the sauce, this was not the case.  The staff bring over the cooked fish and dissect it and plate it for us table side (they did a rush job because I found several bones in my pieces), it was served with roasted (overdone) fingerling potatoes and sauteed (mushy) zucchini slices.  The fish was unseasoned and we were expected to dollop the accompanying (average) sauces ontop of it.  The potatoes and zucchini were nothing to be worth remembering, and neither was the fish.  The other slight upside of this meal was the desert, their gelato and sorbetto were great however I have no idea if they were responsible for them or if they shipped them in from Italy everyday. Gelato is not hard to make either so its a good sign they didn't miss the mark otherwise this would be a zero star review.   Ultimately there are so many other more amazing restaurants in Vegas, and probably even better Italian restaurants in your hometown that you should visit first before Bartolotta.  What a huge disappointment.",

    "text": "This is quite possibly the worst meal / dining experience we've ever had.  A group of business colleagues and I went to Bartlotta on Wednesday for dinner. We had made reservations a few weeks in advance.  Upon arrival, we were seated in the entry hall of an otherwise empty restaurant.  We were initally given menus, and a waiter came to our table about 10 minutes after we arrived.   While we had observed him interacting with other guests - presenting the fish cart with fresh options for the day, explaning specials - he simply greeted us with a \"are you ready, girls?\"  He was disrespectful and inappropriate.  We placed our order (bottle of wine - which was great, first courses and mains) and asked for limes to accompany our sparkling water. Actually getting the limes proved to be quite the feat - after asking our waiter (no success), we asked the busboy (no success), another waiter (no success) and the bartender (no success). Finally, after asking our waiter again, we were given three shriveled, dry limes.  First courses were fine - salads, the parm custard. No complaints here.  The main courses, however, were horrific.  Two of us had ordered an entree sized pasta - the butternut squash ravioli.  What came out was unfortunately not ravioli - it was tortelli. The entree sized portion was only about 8 tortellini.  The menu had described the dish as being in a light brown butter. Our pasta dishes were covered in a thick layer of something crunchy that tasted and resembled brown sugar. Our overwhelming impression was that we were actually eating a dessert course.  The other guest at our table got a mixed seafood pasta. Again, underwhelming. The dish was sweet, with very little pieces of seafood and a thick cream sauce.   During dinner, service was again spotty. Our waiters has problems remembering to refill our wine glasses, but became upset when we attempted to do so ourselves.  We ordered a dessert to share (the Lemon cake w/ Rosemary Gelato), and again, the quality of the food was less than thrilling.    We got out the credit card to pay and waited, and waited, and waited. The waiter walked by our table plenty of times - and while it was clear we had abandoned our dessert and our wine glasses were empty - he did not provide a bill until we sought him out and asked for it.   All of us agreed that we had had better service and food at any chain Italian restaurant. For a restaurant that apparently is regarded in such high esteem (AAA stars, Michelin star) - we were completely disappointed with our experience and will never return.",

    "text": "After looking at the pics of Bartolotta on Wynn's website, I really had high expectations for the place. The photo that got me into the restaurant was the picture of the spaghetti with the clams - that dish was awesome, and so was the octopus salad. The pomegranate / blueberry Portofino cocktail was tasty too.  Unfortunately the compliments end there. As an Asian, I am used to eating live fish prepared in a way that maintains the sweetness and juiciness of the fish. The Japanese and Chinese, for instance, all prepare their fish in that manner, and cooked to perfected timing so that it's pulled off the stove at the exact precise moment. As an Asian we also savor the entire fish, from the head to tail to the collar to the skin and everything in between.  This wasn't the case at Bartolotta, unfortunately. We ordered the smallest fish of the night, the sea bass. I don't contest their claim that the seafood is flown in daily...it doesn't seem to matter how fresh the fish is if they don't know how to prepare it to begin with.   Bartolotta's cooking method leaves the fish tasteless, dry, stale, overcooked, bland, unexciting, boring, and blah. Obviously the tomato & basil concoction is not a natural enhancing flavor for fish - it only works with shellfish - and I was thoroughly disappointed and felt sorry for Bartolotta when the server filleted the fish and threw out the best parts...basically everything that was attached to bone.  When will chefs learn that the tastiest parts of animals and fishes are the parts directly attached to the bone? I mean, they must know that because chefs make stock with bones.   Bartolotta has no clue what they are doing...they shouldn't try to specialize in a food that they don't understand. Preparing fish is an exquisite and delicate art form. Sure, Bartolotta has access to the fish, but it doesn't mean they know what to do with it.  If you guys really want to have excellent seafood, better to buy your fish from Bartolotta - raw - and bring it over to Wing Lei or another Chinese restaurant so they can steam it with soy sauce, green onion and ginger to achieve maximum sweetness and tastiness. Or they can fry it so the skin is crispy and the meat is juicy and tender.  Otherwise, you might as well spend the $135 playing slots or some other money-eating casino game.   And yes, service is snooty...that happens when people think too highly of themselves. This is another one of those chichi Vegas restaurants where decor and trendiness trumps food quality.",

The rest of the seafood dishes were so plain and I couldn't taste the freshness at all.  Pasta dishes were pretty bad overall.  The only dish that was a bit interesting was the salt encrusted branzino, which took 2 waiters at least 5 minutes to crack it open.  The most wonderful part of the whole dining experience was being able to sit outside by the pond at the cabana.",

    "text": "A few Yelpers have stumbled upon my shot of the langoustine. As proven, a picture's worth a thousand words, but nonetheless, here are the thousand words:  I hadn't heard anything about Bartolotta Ristorante di Mare until I picked up an issue of my boss' Departures magazine (AMEX Platinum cardholders). The article basically said that Executive Chef Paul Bartolotta had to bend over backwards to get his hands on the most delicious LIVE langoustines on the planet. To say that I was intrigued would be an understatement.   For my 31st birthday, my fiancee and I treated ourselves to a Las Vegas weekend and on the itinerary was a visit to Chef Bartolotta's Las Vegas gem.   The decor was classic Italian, but it wasn't until we descended into the lower level that I realized that Chef Bartolotta wanted this restaurant to be something extraordinary. Our hostess led us to our outdoor patio table by the water feature.   The hostess seated us and handed us two stingray skin wrapped menus to peruse. Our waiter carted out an iced display case filled with the day's freshest products - a few of the creatures were still moving. That was when I spotted the langoustines.   The langoustines were delicious; barely grilled, lightly seasoned to preserve the flavors and completely worth the excursion.   In summation, although this meal will cost you one of your shinier pennies, it is definitely worth experiencing once... or if your stash of shiny, pretty pennies permits, a few times for special occasions.",

The bartender was quite knowledgeable of the wines on hand.  He also offered my friend and I the drink that Beyonce orders when she eats here.  For two 29 year old women, that won us over instantly.  The Dream was a beautiful blend of champagne, lotus flowers, and whimsy.  After approximately seven minutes, we were escorted down to our table.  Our drinks were whisked away by a server and placed gently at our new seats around the reflecting pond.  Our table was situated in a cabana like cocoon off the pond.  We had heaters above us that were warmed up to accommodate our cold shoulders.  We were greeted by a waiter to take our drink orders that promptly arrived within minutes.  We ordered the Top Chef menu that was a wonderful six course Italian style meal.  We enjoyed ravioli, soft-shell crab, Tuscan white fish, langosta, squid ink risotto, and many more delicious treats.   We were watched over by multiple servers and bussers.  This is most definitely a spot to treat yourself to at some point.",

Our table had a nice water view that added nicely to the ambiance.   Unlike some expensive restaurants which give you tiny portions, the multiple courses were extremely filling and the fresh seafood did not disappoint. The presentation was flawless, service was impressive, and the overall meal was memorable.   We got to try the famous langoustine, which apparently only 12 restaurants in the world have flown in live (and Bartolotta is obviously one of them). They were sweet and well cooked.   The Top Chef tasting menu had a variety of pasta, seafood, risotto, and ended with the biggest pesce al sale profumato (fish course) I've ever seen! It was truly an impressive speciman of fish, coated in salt and lemon seasonings. They de-boned it table side and serve just the moist filet. We were all so full, but still managed to eat a fair amount.   It was a pricey meal ($750 for 3 of us) but we did choose the most expensive tasting menu and overall, I would say it was worth it for the elegant presentation and wonderful meal!",

Our server was very personable and professional.    We loved seeing the fresh fish display in the ice display and learning about each fish and the taste of each fish.  We went for the $150 tasting menu.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The white wine we were recommended (they were very understanding of our limited budget) paired beautifully with the seafood and the pastas.  We noted that the presentation of the pasta tastings was very \"home\"-y and the taste was so balanced.  At last the \"sinfonia\" of desserts was of showstopping quality, visually and tastefully.  Three ices, three gelatos, three sorbets, a slice of cake, and I think a panna cotta.    The service was also lovely.  We felt like we were truly on an intimate date but always had our table attended to carefully.  We liked the high ceilings and how bright the restaurant was, and also how the tables were seated so that we still felt intimate regardless of the open floor plan.  Excellent experience.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner at Bartolotta to celebrate a special occasion in Vegas, and while we were initially very, very excited to eat dinner here, we were left a little bit disappointed at the end of it all. After reviewing our menu options with our server, Catalin, we decided to try the Bravo's Top Chef dinner menu. This is easily the most expensive item on the menu at $180pp, so we had very high expectations. We are no strangers to fine dining and usually opt for a chef's tasting menu if given the option.   Let me start out by saying that our reservation was for a 6:15pm seating. Service was very attentive during the first few courses, and eventually trailed off as the night went on and the restaurant got busier. That alone was disappointing. You would expect an establishment to provide outstanding service from start to finish, ESPECIALLY if they are well-regarded and put themselves out to be among the best of the best.   The Top Chef Menu:  - Catalin brought out some house-made bread, but warned us not to fill up on it since there were many courses to follow. I only had a few bites, but they were very good. It was hard to stop eating the bread for sure.  - We started with some fresh marinated Mediterranean anchovies. These were quite yummy and we felt that we were off to a great start.  - Next up was the Ligurian octopus salad, soaked in olive oil and lemon. The octopus was extremely tender and very flavorful. The olive oil and citrus notes were well-balanced. Followed by seared sea scallops with porcini mushrooms. (The scallops were by far, my favorite dish of the evening. They were perfectly seared and the mushrooms brought life to the party!) We also had some John Dory fish, and spiny lobster. These were all very good. The langoustine was sweet and delicious, and according to Catalin, Bartolotto is one of 12 restaurants in the world that get this type of lobster delivered fresh from Italy.  - Our pasta dishes arrived next... (This is sort of when service started to drop off...) We had sheep's milk ricotta ravioli with pecorino cheese, rigatoni with scorpion fish and eggplant, risotto with clams, scallops, shrimp, lobster, cuttlefish, and octopus, and penne with lobster, shrimp, and crab in a tomato sauce. The ravioli was smooth and my husband really enjoyed it. The rigatoni and risotto were both equally alright, but we didn't rave about these two much. I will add that the eggplant in the rigatoni dish was more \"room temperature\" than the rest of the dish. That was a little odd. The penne was my favorite of all the pastas. The penne tasted like it was boiled in a seafood broth - that's how flavorful it was. I wish I only ordered a huge plate of this penne for dinner.  - Finally, the grand finale was a whole Mediterranean fish, baked in an aromatic salt crust. (I believe it was sea bream.) This was the dish that everyone raved about and the sole reason for us having dinner here... Not only was there about a 15 minute gap between the time the pasta dishes were cleared and the fish brought out, but the fish was overdone!!! It was the driest fish I've ever had in my life, and although it smelled wonderfully aromatic (lots of fennel), it was actually very bland. The fish was filleted table side... Juan served it to us, and he didn't do that great of a job with his knife skills. Both my husband and I had bones in our fish and proceeded to eat with caution. We forced ourselves to finish the fish entree, but honestly, didn't care much for it at all. It was served with some steamed cucumbers, which I am assuming is a necessary pairing to add moisture to the dry fish.  - A symphony of desserts followed: 3 flavors of gelato, 3 flavors of sorbet, 3 flavors of shaved ice, an olive oil cake, a chocolate mousse with olive oil, and a few pieces of chocolate. It was dessert overload... The gelato, sorbet, and shaved ice were all enjoyable. The other parts of dessert, I didn't really care much for.   By the time dinner was over, almost 3 hours had elapsed and we had to be on our way to catch a show. It took about 20 minutes for Juan to get the check. Basically after the pastas arrived, our main server, Catalin, never returned and I guess Juan filled his role. They didn't refill our water glasses as often, and did not check on how we were doing after the dishes were served... It was upsetting that we were spending all of this money for a tasting menu, but all of a sudden it was like we didn't matter since there were other parties to tend to.   At the end of the day, we dropped well over $450 (excludes wine) and felt a little bit ripped off to be honest. Had the service been consistent from start to finish, and had the fish not been overdone, we might have felt differently. The meal started out well, but did not end up as well as I would have liked. I'd recommend to order a la carte and not to splurge on the Top Chef menu.",

When they order the fish, they can actually track it to the minute where it is at all times all over the world. They only get fresh live fish here. When you order from the menu, they get the fish out of the tank and cook it. It doesn't get any fresher than that from a restaurant.  The staff here is well trained and very professional. They can assist with any dietary needs. If you can choose the option of letting them bring out choices from the chef, I highly recommend doing this. It is unbelievable how good everything will be. My absolute favorite fish from Bartolotta is the Branzino. It is to die for.  They have beautiful outside seating and if you can, request this before sitting inside. I have traveled to many places around the world and this place is one of the best. It is not a cheap dining experience but is worth every penny. You will not be sorry.",

This place is very very pricey and worth most of it, but what threw me is their confusing meal policies. I remember that if you wanted one of the fish from the case, you had to split it between two people and if there are two in your party, well, you're all getting the same thing, something that may not be appealing to many. I couldn't quite understand the breakdown since I had never encountered this before, so it would be beneficial to everyone to lay this out for people ahead of time.",

We decided on fish for three of the four of us and specifically asked for the sauce with NO OLIVES.  Our appetizers were just average. (ravioli and antipasto). The meal was prepared tableside and after mine was served I realized it had olives. It took several minutes to get the waiter's attention to tell him of the error. He apologized, and I should have sent it back.  The entire fish dish tasted like olives. They gave us a few chocolates after dinner as an apology for the error. They should have comped my meal. There are many great restaurants in Vegas. This is not one of them.",

    "text": "Overpromise, under deliver... That should be the motto of this place. The concierge Wendy highly recommended this place and would not stop talking about it. We had a few dietary restrictions and they went above and beyond to promise the sun, moon and stars to us. We were super stoked until it took 1.5 hours for our main course to arrive and the $32 bowl of pasta looked like it was something I could have cooked up in a college dorm room. Flavorless and utterly underwhelming. The risotto was ok for being uncooked. You would think an hour and a half would've been enough time to cook risotto. The pasta was just so awful it ruined the whole meal. The bartender put salt in our cocktail and over salted the food so much that my hands are swollen today and my entire body is bloated. To top it off, the someone at the restaurant stole our credit card number to buy something on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWalmart.com&s=cc8761f6901f940a16b6002fd96ea156e6fe6496066d7ab0dca74c26274f88f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walmart.com</a> and we had to cancel our card. Moral of the story is that there's a billion places to eat in Vegas, so don't let the concierge talk you into this one.",

    "text": "meh  That's about all I have to say.  First off, this place is loud as hell since it's open tables and they are all pretty close together.  For starters, they cart this refrigerated fish display thing over to you and tell you what they have available. I dunno, but for me that wasn't so interesting because I was wondering what was going to happen to those poor fish in the display. Did they die for no reason just to get thrown away as unfit for cooking??? Poor fishies. =(  So with three people, the waiter suggested some sort of sampler thing. We were like, ok sounds good. Then we somehow ended up with bottled water and some bottle of crazy red wine. Of course there's no prices on the menu, but since I wasn't paying and was told not to worry about the price.....bottoms up!!!!!!  Each of the entrees were pretty sparse, and honestly I don't even remember anything good about them. The only thing I recall is thinking, holy crap if I was paying for this then I'd be pissed because this stuff is pretty bland. Plus I was starving, and when they bring a small amount of food at a time, it really doesn't hit the spot. It's more like a teaser that makes you scared that each thing is the last. And sure enough, the last thing came and I was still hungry. Even the dessert was meh, some sort of ice cream things and some bland chocolate cake thing.  They have a lot of waitstaff, but it's almost impersonal since none of them really know what you ordered or what is going on specifically at your table. Almost a kind of high end clusterfuck. And somewhat slow service too, when we were barely 2/3 done a party at the next table was done and gone (and they were seated after we were!!)  So we ended up knocking off two bottles of wine as well and the bill came to like around 700 bucks. OMFG pretty horrible since I was neither impressed, drunk, nor full.  Sadly, if I had been the one spending 700 and trying to impress someone, it would have been an epic fail. Good thing this wasn't the case!  So yeah, if you are trying to show off to someone, maybe somewhere else would be a better idea. Like In-n-Out would probably do a better job and you could even buy your date 5 In-n-Out tshirts and all kind of goodies and save like 400 dollars. =D",

That was really good. All of the shellfish lived up to the expectations along with great flavor.  Then ordered what they called the best shrimp in the world. It was not even close to being the best shrimp. It was 30 bucks per shrimp. Even if it was 3 bucks I can still tell you it was weak.   Then ordered a fish called branzino from the cart of fresh seafood that they roll up to your table. They charged me 120 bucks for the fish and it did not taste like fresh fish. Maybe refresh.  What a rip off!   Some restaurants are good at making feel satisfied after they rip you off. This place did not come close.",

    "text": "This is a stunningly beautiful restaurant, no doubt about it.  And Chef Paul Bartolotta has deservedly won praise (and two James Beard Awards) for his brilliant cuisine.  So why only 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) stars instead of five?  Well, it's simple.  That's what it deserved.  The Wynn advertises that, \"Bragging about award-winning chefs is one thing.  Having them cook your dinner is another.\"  Now that certainly implies, at least, that Chef Bartolotta is himself present in the kitchen during dinner.  I don't know if he was or not.  But what I do know is that a) Chef Bartolotta is supposed to be a genius with seafood; b) he gets virtually all of his seafood flown in directly from Italy; and that c) his speciality is cooking the whole fish, filleting it tableside, and serving it for two.  This is a restaurant we looked forward to dining in . . .  There were seven us, celebrating a friend's birthday.  We each ordered appetizers, and the plates went flying around the table!  Apps included Seared Sea Scallops with Porcini Mushrooms appetizer was outstanding, as was the Warm Parmigiano-Reggiano Custard with Wild Mushrooms and Brussel Sprout Leaves and the Silky Duck Liver Mousse with Black Truffle.    Speaking of truffles, Italian white truffles were in but were advertised on the menu as begin available with *any* dish for $85.00 extra.    Uh, no.  Pasta courses included (among others) Lasagnette of Pasta, Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, White Wine, and Tomato; Gnocchi with Tomato sauce, Butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano; and the Linguine with Clams, White Wine, Rapini, Garlic, and Parsley.  All very, very good -- though *not* as good as, say, the pasta courses at Quince in San Francisco.  For the whole fish, Lynn and I had the San Pietro (aka John Dory), and while the flavors were delicious, the fish was overcooked and dry.    Now, in all honesty, my guess is that it was an simply an off-night in terms of the overcooked fish.   At nearly $1150 for seven of us (not including tip) a bargain, this place is not, but I'd be willing to come back . . . even quicker if someone else picks up the tab!",

The food was delicious, 4-star+ quality, the service was great, it was just SOOOOO over-priced I have to knock it down to Earth.  Our meal consisted of:  -A delicious ravioli appetizer- (5 or 6 pieces) -An Arugula / Pancetta salad (tiny) -A turbot (like a sole)- flown in from the Mediterranean, shared for 2.  This fishy cost us about $150, so it flew on business class for sure. -A shared dessert (it was delicious) -2 glasses of wine  Total (with tip)- just over $300  The meal was great- top to bottom, but every item was relatively acceptable to small in size, and simply super expensive.  I can't say I won't ever return, because the food truly was great, however the value is suspect and it would be much easier for me to return if I had a comp from the casino!",

    "text": "I am shocked at the horrible reviews. After living in Italy for 8 years, I have spent the last 13 looking for octopus salad and this was the only restaurant I have found so far that has it.   I knew this establishment was authentic when the sommelier (or I guess the \"waiter # 1\" most people are referring to...) and the very helpful, informative waiter spoke to me in Italian. After much conversation, I learned that the waiter was from Milan and has served at several other reputable restaurants in NYC and the sommelier was a young woman from Rome.  We had the $140 pp prix fix and I found it to be a great deal. The fish is flown in from Italy daily, and in fact, I haven't had seafood cooked and taste like this since my last time in Sicily. This is the real deal.  We started with the 4 appetizers. The scallops on the porcini mushrooms was heaven. Porcini mushrooms are very rare and difficult to find in the US and I was EXTREMELY impressed to find them fresh cut paired with this dish. Usually in the U.S. they can only be found dried!  The octopus salad was also very delicious but I have to admit I prefer the one in Italy because it's served as a real salad, not just paired with potatoes. The clams were very delicious, full of flavor. Our last appetizer, the arugola salad was very yummy and light - perfect pairing.  Our main course consisted of seafood risotto, pasta, and ravioli. I could instantly taste that the ravioli used hand-made dough - which was also impressive. The risotto was cooked to perfection and the pasta was al dente. Everything was perfect.  Finally we had our second course which was the fish. I was impressed with the generous serving and also the side dishes of the zucchini and onion&tomato topping on the fish. The contrast of the vegetables with the clean, fresh taste of the fish was amazing.  And finally, the three desserts, which made our neighbors very envious, was also rich in flavor and delicious. I especially enjoyed the home made gelato & sorbet trio combo as well as the panacotta with berries...  All in all, one of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in the United States and I can't wait to try Bartolotta's sister restaurant, San Domenico in NYC soon...",

I dined here quite some time ago and so do not remember all of the exact details, but I recall that we had the Loup de Mer fresh from the mediterranean and various pastas and salads. We paired wines with every course essentially and went all out. It was insane.  We ordered 4 of the desserts; however, the one I wanted the most (and it WAS my birthday) was the vanilla fig semifreddo- which we had not selected. Upon consuming all 4 desserts, I mandated that we must try this one also and I can honestly say no dessert has ever lived up to it. Although, last night's dessert at Tilth in Seattle came close!  Totally worth the large bill and an absolutely stunning restaurant. Having fine dined at many top restaurants, I am not sure why the ratings are not higher. I went again a second time and was just as impressed.",

I did not get the full experience at this place mainly because I am not someone that eats seafood (it is flown in fresh from the Mediterranean everyday).  I think that is a little ridiculous, but considering there are no fish in the desert, I don't blame them.  So, this relegated me to a few pasta dishes and some pancetta.  The pancetta was tough and fatty, but I expected that.  Could have been better though.  The sheep's milk ravioli was delicious, but the spaghetti with ragu could have been better.  Overall, not that impressed for the price,but I didn't eat outside.  That could have made the experience cooler.  The should take Bartolotta's Lake Park Bistro in Milwaukee and stick it in the Wynn, in my humble opinion.",

    "text": "Overpricing brings this restaurant down to three star territory, even though service was almost spectacular.  Their website shows a great outdoor visual pool that is stunning.  Note:  You will not be sitting anywhere near that pool.  Nobody was. I don't know why.  It was 8pm and about 85 outside, but everyone was seated inside.  Outside..like their website pictures show...was off limits. We asked. Not an option.  We looked at the empty tables through curtains.  The food was perfect.  The appetizer fried med fish was spectacular.  The appetizer rags of pasta with crab, lobster etc.. and the appetizer shrimp ravioli would have been star attractions as main courses.  However, no main course portions of these dishes was offered.  They want you to eat the almost unpriced fish.  We were directed away by our waiter from the John Dory to another white fish, since my petite date was done after the app pasta.  The white fish that had obviously flown first class from Maranello was moist, delicately flavored, but nothing special.  One plate $115. For unspectacular fish.  Otherwise, we had two cocktails, bread, two great fish appetizers and two great  pasta appetizers for about $130. Not bad for Vegas, and worth it.  Throw the forgettable hunk of whitefish on the tab, and it was $245!  Really, the fish was good, but on par with tourist traps in SF's Fisherman's Wharf district.  I'll pick Aliotto's anyday over this fish.  We were not informed of the price of our fish until the bill came.  The menu said $15 per 3oz.  I eat about a half pound of fish regularly. I guess pricing was before skinning and de-boning, which they did at the table. Nice touch.  Skip the fish.  Really.  Order appetizers like they are tapas, and this is a great place.  If you get sucked in on the fish, you will get robbed.  You might as well tell some kid in New Orleans \"where they got them shoes\" for $100.  You'll get more entertainment value.",

After a careful review of the menu, I ordered the duck liver mousse with truffles, and the \"rags\" of pasta with lobster, crab and shrimp. My wife ordered a frisee salad, and the vegetable risotto. My mousse and pasta were extremely good, but my wife was somewhat disappointed in the risotto.

    "text": "After saving my pretty pennies for a while, and waiting for the right occasion (in this case, my home-girls from the MIA coming in for a weekend of reverie), I went to Bartolotta expecting the world and then some. SIGH. Where do I begin??   We ordered a bottle of Prosecco to ease into the night. As we were raising our hands in the air for our first toast, my friend found something brown floating in her glass. EEW... but, no worries -- we are in Bartolotta! The waiter will surely apologize and bring us another bottle... right?? Wrong. Instead, he found her another glass and poured some Prosecco into her glass and off he went... not to be seen much for the rest of night.   Because their prize on the menu is the fresh imported whole fish, we opted to go with appetizers and save room for the bronzino, which was bought whole to the table in a fish cart. While I totally can appreciate this Euro-tradition, I also appreciate that others do not. And, let's be honest, I'm not into seeing fish eyes right before I partake. Anyways, on the menu, it read $15 per 100 grams... Harmless, right?? Sorry folks. Each portion (which require min of 2 people), works out to be about $75. At least the waiter offered to give us a 3 person size (as opposed to the 5 person size) fish. But at $200 for a 3 person portion... DAMN GINA!!!   The apps we ordered were delish -- the octopus salad was scrumptious, as was the brussel custard that my girl ordered. Thus the reason for the 2 stars (and not 1)   And finally, the bronzino.... our bad waiter made a brief reappearance and cut the fish so unevenly that some of us got HUGE portions while others got slivers of fish. The fish was great... but it was seeped in oil! Before I would put it in my mouth, I would blot the sides of the plate to get rid of excess! I still can't be sure if it was the fish that was oily or if it was the sides (pan sauteed zucchini; a tomato basil mix; and roasted potatoes) but an oil sauce in your plate is gross.   All in all, my pretty pennies were wasted on Bartolotta. The ambiance is so-so; the service is terrible; and the food is mediocre (with the apps and wines being the stars).   My recommendation: save your $$ and go to any of the other fantastic seafood restos in town.",

I would consider myself a connoisseur in fine dining while in Vegas and thought this would be a great opportunity for our group to try.. Unfortunately, everything from the loud and crowded tables.. The rushed poor service... the under cooked raw rice which they passed as Risotto and the burned Bronzini which they paired with the watery sauces.. Our group if six was extremely disappointed with this restaurant and won't return anytime soon... Yes, I've dined at many  Michelin star restaurants this definitely missed the mark.. Save your time there are many other delicious dining experiences in Vegas!",

    "text": "Full disclosure upfront: I did not pay a cent for this meal, as people that invited me were were mega-guests of the casino host.  That being said, I believe our bill was approx $170/pp.   Atmosphere = 5 stars, big time! When I heard we were sitting outside along the lagoon, I about fainted b/c the temps were 109 that day, cooling to a nice 98 in evening.  \"You asked for this table?\", I wondered.  But (see disclosure above) my job was to shut up and be grateful!  Much to my delight, they actually AIR-CONDITION THE OUTSIDE, making it a wonderful, peaceful, cozy dining experience, with each table having its own canopied cabana.  (Sorry, energy-saver geeks... just one other reason to be appalled by Vegas.)  Food & Wine = 4 stars. Beautiful & simple presentations, high-quality, simple & fresh ingredients, portions are moderate.  Considering how $$$ the menu was, the wines were surprisingly value-priced.  If you know your Italian wines (hard to go wrong if you like dry, mineral-y whites anyway), then you'll be as happy as a porcca in merda.  Menu = 1 star, for extreme over-complication. So they price fish by the gram, most around $15/100 grams.  Good thing There's An App For That, b/c who can figure that out?!  (BTW, 1 oz = 28.35 gr, so you want about 170g of fish for a standard 6oz serving.)  Ok, so I get we're messed up here in the US & don't use the metric system, but seriously, that's just unnecessary.  Plus, then it makes suggestions about how many ounces are suggested per person... thereby going schizo on standards of measurement.  To make this even stupider, you're bound to pay for whatever size whole fish (b/c you have to buy the whole thing) the kitchen has available, so it's not just enough that you decide you want 650g of san pietro, b/c then the server has to go check w/ the kitchen to see if they have something like that even in stock.  WTF?  After 20 mins of straining over the menu (and we were all sober, mind you), we agreed to just close up & have the waiter order for us.  Everything was delicious, but I'd think twice before coming back here b/c of the kooky menu hassle.",

It's easier on the system and takes far less recovery time. With the wife and a couple friends in tow, we decided to check out some of the Wynn/Encore restaurants. Bartolotta was our first stop.  We grabbed some seats at the bar, ordered some drinks and looked over the menu. We got two orders of the lasagnette con ragu di crostacei. It was recently featured on the Food Network as one of Bobby Flay's favorite appetizers. Now, I'm not a Flay fan, but the dish did sound delicious -- pasta, lobster, crab, shrimp, white wine and tomatoes. While it isn't one of the best dishes I've ever had, it was very good with large chunks of lobster and crab and a light, fresh profile overall.  They were nice enough the split the orders so we each had our own plate. The bartenders were friendly and accommodating and didn't mind that we only stuck around for a drink and one order. They did verify that the fish is flown in fresh daily from Italy -- and yes, that expense is passed on to you. If you're looking for cheap seafood go to Red Lobster.",

Rich who is the bartender was beyond accommodating and can make a delicious drink. My husband ordered a \"cable car\" and I had the Kir Royal to start. Both delicious. And he was just a delight.  We were then seated downstairs near the water with the most romantic view. It is just beautiful.  Our Italian waiter Luciano knew everything there was to know about food, especially fish. He was able to describe all the little differences between each fish that had jumped from the ocean and flown here just a day or so ago.   We had the artichoke salad with porcini mushrooms which was just mouth watering. Arugula was warm and porcini were delectable. Next we split a small portion of the seafood risotto. Outrageous. The little langoustine that was there was the sweetest fish I have ever tried. Lastly we had the Bronzino. He brought us 3 different sauces. Tomatoes with garlic, salmoroglio, and one with lots of anchovies.  One was better than the next.  One of the best meals we have ever had at a restaurant.",

From the host that said they didn't have tables available when the restaurant was barely full, to sitting down at the bar and dealing with a crowd of obnoxious group of people screaming, not chatting, behind your neck and laying on the same stool we were sitting at.  I felt like I was at some Irish pub. The bar tender wasn't bad, but he just didn't have common sense or touch.  The food was ok, nothing special. I would not even consider ever coming back here.

    "text": "The food was fine. As usual, the appetizers are better than most of the entrees. Expensive? Yes, but that doesn't matter if the food and service warrant it. However, in the case of Bartolotta, the service was horrible. We felt we were being served by a used car or timeshare salesman. This guy (Mario? Marcutio?) talked fast and kept the menu as confusing as possible resulting in a $350++ meal for two that did not include desserts and only a half bottle of wine since my husband was not drinking.   The fish is priced by the ounce and since we were ordering different entrees, we were concerned over the amount each of us would receive. This waiter Assured us he would size the portion to best suit US. Did not happen. Put the entire fish on the plate coming to a $90 entree that my husband couldn't finish! Also, I think the waiter got mad that neither of us got the truffle add-on and ignored us the rest of the night. We were not picky nor complainers. To celebrate our 25th Anniversary & my husband's birthday, we came out expecting to pay dearly for this meal, BUT we also expected to be treated extremely well and not offered \"up sells\" constantly. Not the \"classy\" experience they try to portray.   If Chef is \"obsessed with making your experience as close as possible to dining at an Italian seaside villa\" as another review stated, he failed miserably. I've been to Italy and was treated far better there than at Bartolotta's. We were VERY DISAPPOINTED and would like our money back! We wouldn't have tipped the head waiter, but there were other guys that attended to us as well who were very nice (and I think told to be quiet because they only spoke when spoken to) and we didn't want to stiff them.",

    "text": "Chef Paul Bartolotta is obsessed with making your experience as close as possible to dining at an Italian seaside villa.  To do so, seafood is flown in from the Mediterranean.  Mushrooms he uses were plucked from Italian soil.  Several Yelpers noted their waiters spoke fluent Italian.  The waiter for our table was actually Latino and was fluent in Spanish. Close enough.  Try not to get piss drunk at the casino before coming here because you need to do math.  This restaurant sells their fish whole, priced by dollars per 100 grams. Divide that by the number of diners.   Also, it helps if you're dining with a cocaine dealer so he can explain what 100 grams of anything looks like.  It's no surprise that many Yelpers complained about being sucker punched by the bill.  Many reviewers also griped about the simplicity of the food.  For the cash you're spending, there are better places if you're on a Vegas safari for an artistic and innovative meal.  Bartolotta publicly admits he's not a creative chef.   His plating is slightly better than Olive Garden.  But close your eyes...this is not the garlicky, red-sauced, heavily-cheesed Italian food Americans are used to.  The dishes we tried were fresh, light, and uncomplicated.  Ingredients were kept to a minimum, serving to enhance instead of obscure.  Simple Italian seafood, cooked to delicious perfection.

    "text": "There are a lot of reviews that are kind of all over the place.  This is a seafood restaurant, so let me just say that when I read less than stellar reviews by people who didn't order seafood, it irks me a bit.  This place does seafood great.  The presentations are not fancy and the emphasis is on the pristine freshness and quality of the ingredients.  This place is expensive.  Really expensive.  But the fish and shellfish are flown in every few days from Italy.  Where you gonna get that anyhow?  And in the middle of a desert?  Sure, it's gonna cost you.  We had the Bravo Top Chef tasting menu - this is their best tasting menu.  This is a lot of food.  Some of it was not that memorable but there were a few dishes that were crazy good.  I mean, so good that it stopped you in mid-chew.  You pause before taking the next bite because you want the flavor to linger in your mouth longer.  Nope, not even a sip of delicious wine will be allowed to disrupt the gentle decay of the sensation.  Enough of the poetic waxing.  Let's get down to it.  I'm going to go over my raves and then a few complaints.  The ravioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana (sheep's milk ricotta cheese ravioli with pecorino and marsala wine glaze) is perhaps the most delicious pasta I've ever had.  This is one of the restaurant's signature dishes, and rightfully so. OMG.  The grilled rock lobster is case in point on how fresh ingredients, simply prepared, can be sublime.  Other highlights were the tiny soft shelled crab, the octopus salad, and the salt crusted snapper.  The service was in general very attentive.  The wine selection is large but pricey.  $80 for Santa Margherita pinot grigio?  Where do they think they are, Vegas?  ... Oops.  We did settle on a beautiful Chablis and a knockout Brunello di Montalcino.  My biggest complaint was with the bar.  I asked for an Aviation cocktail - a classic gin-based cocktail that is not obscure by any means.  The waiter came back and said the bartender didn't know what that was.  Huh?  Don't they have a recipe book back there?  So I used the cocktail app on my phone to give the waiter the recipe: gin, lemon juice, Luxardo maraschino liqueur, lemon twist.  Ok, that's weird.  At least they didn't ask me for any food recipes - I have an app for that too.  Then the waiter comes back to tell me that they did not have Luxardo maraschino liqueur.  What kind of high end Italian place doesn't have Luxardo maraschino liqueur?  So I ordered a martini.  They knew how to make that.  The bar issues and a few duds (bland risotto, boring seafood rigatoni, uninspiring desserts) brought my rating down to 4 stars.",

When we walked up to the hostess desk, all four women completely ignored us, then assisted the couple behind us and sat them at the bar to wait. When one girl finally looked reproachfully over and asked for our reservation she told us we'd have to wait, not offering the bar as an option.  As we were seated, over twenty minutes later, two waiters had a tiny amusing dispute over who would wait on us. They were both very nice. Skipping the wine list, we decided on mixed drinks, which were okay but not worth the price. The decor was fab, and I wanted to see the grotto area. The seafood risotto was good but I don't like my pasta al dente [is that how risotto should be? too nutty, ick], the chicken was tasty, and the seared beef had no flavor but was very tender and juicy.  It was amusing watching two guys get their fish carved up. Boy, I sure hope they enjoyed that expensive as heck fish.   Total we were there two hours, and when we left at 10.30 there was still a big line waiting to be seated. Overall, we weren't blown away by our choice for a fancy dinner, and definitely preferred our drunk night at In-N-Out.",

The foos items were either not prepared correctly or maybe an off night.  Each item lacked any type of seasonings, freshness or flavor of any kind.  Grilled octopus over cooked and chewy.  Scallops lacked flavor and were not fresh. Polenta has a sauce that tastes like burned bitter liquid---inedible and that's when we spoke to the server.  The fish was not fresh and smelled bad.  Extremely overpriced for bad food.  Many other way better places to eat at the Wynn---La Cave being one and The Cafe being another.",

    "text": "One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to, by far. We were running late to the Le Reve show which we had booked at the hotel (our fault) and we had reservations at the Costa di Mare. Typically the dining experience is at Costa di Mare is suppose to be 1-2 hour experience and I can understand why.  The beautiful outdoor seating has a coy pond and is so relaxing. Now we had to speed up this 2 hour experience into 30 minutes. I forgot our servers name but he was awesome and was able to make our experience the best with the short amount of time we had.  To start with, they brought olive bread with ricotta cheese and olive oil which was amazingly addicting.  As far as what we ordered, we left that up to the server (who was Italian). From what I remember we got:  Ravioli Di Ricotta Con Caciotta Toscana Maccheroni Alla Chitarra Al Ragu Toscano Gnocchi Di Patate Con Fonduta Di Pomodoro Insalatina di carciofi, porcini, ruchetta e pecorino  I have to say one of the best pastas I've ever had. I cannot wait to go back to Vegas to try this place again and have the chance to have the chance to have that 1-2 hour experience. Many thanks to our server, he made sure we were taken care of and recommended some awesome dishes!",

My experience was excellent from the very start. Luciano and Andre made sure we had a nice experience. They made sure we were taken care of but didn't smother us either.

The decor is just beautiful and  the restaurant overlooks an outdoor pond (downstairs).  During our last visit, we ordered the octopus, which was probably the best I've ever had, and the gnocchi (amazing!) to start. My husband and I also shared a branzino (fish) with an anchovy sauce that is to die for! I could put that sauce on bread and have that as a meal. Seriously good stuff.  Before you order, they bring out a large rolling display with various raw fish and other seafood. Everything is SUPER fresh, less than 48 hrs from ocean to table. The serving of the cooked fish is quite a presentation. They bring it out, cooked whole, and separate the filets from the bones. It's served with simply cooked, but very delicious, zucchini and potatoes.  Expect to pay around $200 for two people (without alcohol). Great place to celebrate a special occasion!",

    "text": "One of the finest restaurants at the Wynn Hotel. Absolutely stunning decor with gorgeous lagoon water view. The seafood is daily flown in from Italy and the exquisite taste and the preparation will not disappoint the most pickiest foodie. They are absolutely right about their langoustines, they are one of the best we ever had. Tagliatelle pasta with shrimp and lobster was excellent and Bronzino fish was very delicate but with lots of flavor deboned at your table side and accompanied with light citrus sauce. The drinks were strong enough but very tasty.  Panna cotta desert with berries was very light and a nice finish after diner. The complementary little cookies and amazing truffles were delivered with your check. Top notch all the way. The only negative which is a little deceiving is how they charge for the fish $16 for 100 grams on the menu  (who calculates how much it's going to cost...?) so it comes out about $120-$150 for an order. It is big enough for two people but still would be nice to know in advance. Expensive...yes, is it worth it... yes, but be prepare to spend about $350 for a couple. Service is 5 stars as always, it's like every server is  a college graduate with a major in customer service. Overall Great experience.",

Our table was by the window overlooking the pool/patio area...and I was wishing I were outside.  We were presented with a glass case on wheels with their fresh (and moving) seafood. Their seafood comes straight from Italy which may explain the prices. Of all nights not to be in the mood for seafood, I had to pick the night we went here. We got the lasagnette, gnocchi, pollo alla Riviera Ligure, filetto and brodetto di pesce (my bro-in-law got this but he doesn't like to share his food or have pics taken of his food so, I'll be skipping this). For dessert we got budino di cioccolato, zabaglione ghiacciato, granite and gelato.  Lasagnette con Ragu di Crostacei: Pasta sheets with shrimp, lobster, crab in white wine and tomato. Quite tasty and you can definitely taste fresh seafood. 4/5  Gnocchi di Patate con Fonduta di Pomodoro: Potato gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce with basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano. I love gnocchi and this had the perfect texture and consistency. The sauce was simple but amazing. 5/5  Pollo alla Riviera Ligure: Roast chicken with asparagus, artichokes, porcini, olives in lemon herb sauce. Perfectly cooked. Moist chicken quarters with crispy skin. Great sauce. 5/5  Filetto di manzo al Sangiovese: Seared beef filet with potato puree, carrots and rabe in red wine sauce. Tender and perfectly medium-rare. Not very flavorful and not worth $54. 3/5  Budino di Cioccolato e Banana, Gelato di Banana: Warm chocolate-banana custard and banana gelato. 4/5  Zabaglione Ghiacciato al Torrone al Cioccolata Amaro e Arancia: Frozen torrone sabayon, dark chocolate, orange and orange zest. There are two things I don't like combined with chocolate: mint and orange. I was not ersponsible for getting this and I did not like it. 2/5  Gelati & Granite: Pick 6 sorbet (black currant, lemon, mango, coconut, apricot, raspberry)/ gelato (vanilla, banana, espresso, gianduja, pistachio, amarena, rosemary, chocolate, nocciola, zabaglione, croccantini al cioccolato)/ granite (moscato, pineapple, blood orange, strawberry proseco) flavors.  For my 6, I chose banana, gianduja, nocciola and pistachio gelati +  moscato and strawberry proseco granite. I love everything I picked but my favorites were gianduja (chocolate and hazelnut), nocciola (hazelnut), moscato and strawberry proseco. 5/5  The bread service was unremarkable. We got complimentary petit fours after dinner and dessert: chocolates with caramel and tea inside.  Truffles are in season for a limited time at $90/dish (October-November...possibly early December). They have a dress code so, please don't come in casual wear.",

The appetizers we ordered were excellent. The scallops were delicate and perfectly cooked. The langoustine was also delicious.  While the fish looked interesting but we are used to fresh seafood on the coast so flying it in every 48 hours was not overly impressive. It was probably our mistake to stray from their specialty. My wife got a mushroom pasta dish that was good but nothing spectacular. I got the filet which was also good but again nothing exceptional. The cut of meat itself was good but lacking flavor. The creamy polenta it was served on was rather bland and I couldn't help but be reminded of a Mexican plate covered in refried beans.   Service was excellent throughout except for one odd encounter. We thanked one guy for refilling our water multiple times. He told us it was his \"passion.\" It came across as forced and a bit patronizing.   Overall there are lots of restaurants in Vegas charging a premium for overly hyped food and this one falls into that category for me. I don't mind paying the price for great food but I left this one feeling disappointed.",

It's a nice space, down a dramatic marble staircase and facing an inner garden   The burrata with tomato and basil was fresh and beautifully presented, a very generous portion. The next cheesy buttery ravioli with a caramelized balsamic reduction on top was a show stopper. Rich, yet so flavorful. Again, a generous portion of six ravioli for this appetizer course. The Mediterranean seabass over a tomato stew was perfectly cooked.   The only thing that was odd was that the overhead lights kept turning on and off. Very bizarre.",

    "text": "This place blew my mind. I LOVE seafood, and this place knows how to showcase the seafood so it sings. Be prepared to pay $$$ for the seafood though as it seems that most of it is flown in from the Mediterranean. If you can't stand to pay for your fish's flight across the Atlantic, get any one of the pastas - it's no stretch to say that they are comparable to some of the best pastas in Italy (IMO).   I had:  The saute di vongole to start: the sauce is what makes the difference in this dish (you'll hear this often in my review). Simple flavors of tomato, wine, seafood, basil, and garlic that go so so perfectly with the vongole. I had to ask for more bread to sop up the broth.   The maccheroni alla chitarra con ricci di mare for the primi course: this pasta is soooo good. Sea urchin, crab, tomato, lemon - the ingredients sound so decadent. However you taste the sea first, then the butteriness of the sea urchin and the sweetness of the crab. The tomato sauce with lemon cut the richness and add a brightness to the dish. I've had many uni pastas in my time but this takes the cake. It's well balanced. Rich but light, and it respects the animals of the sea so well.   This was over the top but the primi was so good! Garganelli freschi al ragu di crostacei for the secondi: another pasta and it's arguably better than the first. Red and blue shrimp, spider crab, lobster, white wine tomato in a garganelli pasta. It sounds like a huge mix of seafood but they were able to bring out each flavor so you could taste each one so well. The sauce was a tomato base but it tasted more like they took a little bit of the sea and put it in the sauce with some wine and hints of tomato. I can't say enough how this sauce just brought the whole dish together.   Pagaro (purple snapper) in a salmoriglio sauce. They serve the whole fish, so it's best to share this with at least 1 person (after the great bread and pasta you'll be almost full anyway). Each person gets a plate with roasted potatoes, steamed vegetables and the fish. The fish. The fish is simple so if you don't want to pay a ton of money ($16 per 100g. Our fish was 1kg. You get the idea) skip this part. For those of you willing to pay, the fish is delicate and quite beautiful to eat. Quite the treat!  Too full for dessert but I will go back and try it eventually.   Takeaways- on a budget? Order the pasta. You won't be sorry.   Want the full experience? They have a James beard degustation that looked quite impressive. At the very least, do a pasta then a fish to share.",

My dinner party and I had an absolute nightmare experience at this restaurant.  Absolute amateur hour at this place, the entire staff, including management would be better suited for working at a low-end cafe in the city of Barstow. The sommelier was lost and completely incompetent, I wouldn't give this bum a mop job.   We ended up walking out and going straight to another restaurant, enjoyed a fabulous dinner and the night was saved.    How the Wynn hotel management allows this type of restaurant to operate at their hotel is baffling to me. They must know it lowers the image of the Wynn brand.   PLEASE READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY ARE ALL TRUE.   CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!",

It was small, limp, undercooked, under seasoned, and amounted to one small shrimp, cut in half, for $30.00. Shame on you, I know better but most folks that dine there probably don't...

They also gave us complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary and the food was delicious. The positives stop there. Our waiter rarely came in to check in on us, and we could not get his attention to pay and get out. We had to wait 20-30minutes just to get our check, even when we're clearly not eating or touching our food. In fact, we did not even order from our waiter, another gentleman must have sensed our eagerness to order, as he took our orders and relayed the message to our actual waiter.  For someplace as high class as this, I expected to be waited on a bit more than we were. It actually felt as though they weren't paying attention to us because we were younger than other guests.  Disappointed with the experience",

I don't mind paying for quality but to pay for mediocrity makes me angry especially after a $180.00 meal that leaves me hungry. I like lobster so I decided to get the rock lobster spaghetti.  I thought I would like it so much I got the entree which was $60.00 . The only thing I ate on the plate was the four small pieces of lobster  and two bites of noodles. The lobster peices were good but the sauce was pure generic super market grade . We also ordered a salad for $20.00 that came with like 8 spinach leaves, 10 peices of tomatoes, and 4 cheese balls. It was on a plate a little bigger than a saucer. My brother in law ordered the fish that looked blah...he said there was no taste. It looked like cafeteria food . The waiter asked them how they liked the fish he recommended they said it was ok with most of the plate was untouched.  When I  go to an expensive restaurant I expect the food to be creative, delicious and have the wait staff on top of things. We also waited a long time for the entrees. We would have been better off going to Bahama Breeze! I think they should put their heads together and rework their menu.",

Not super friendly at the hostess desk. It took a long time for our server(s) to come to our table.  Finally served water and given menus. We ordered several appetizers and a main dish.  Our bread server, Isaac, was the best, and the truffle rolls were delicious. Unfortunately, it was down hill after that. The grilled octopus was over cooked. The scallop dish lacked flavor. Actually all the dishes lacked flavor and we just didn't taste fresh ingredients. The polenta with truffle sauce was awful, the sauce tasted bitter and over salted, it was actually in edible. We sent it back. Finally the baked pasta came. As soon as our server cut into the foil that encased the dish, we got a terrible smell of bad fish! There were no herbs present in the sauce; we tasted 1 clam and it was bad. At this point we complained to our server who was visibly disappointed and felt bad, he told the manager who also apologized. They took the dishes we complained about off the bill. One final comment, we felt this restaurant was completely over priced! There are many other restaurants at the Wynn that are wonderful! Try Allegro or La Cave.",

For a supposedly a top notch restaurant, this restaurant can't even beat a cafe standard diner. Not sure if it's because we are Asian or the place was busy but its just sad that they can't seem to comprehend basic dining service yet alone fine dining.  Waiter that just stop by and say are we ready to order?? Not bother to introduce himself. And when we asked for any special, he proceeded just to show the paper on the table that I guess he put there cos he don't bother to spiel.   My wife would like an extra truffle bread and the busser that apparently seems only able to speak Spanish said yes and never deliver.  When our appetizers arrived, a $45 langoustine and a $27 octopus. The server or back server doesn't even seem to bother to check back. A simple 2 minutes 2'bites check up. Major flaw. My wife was so mad that we don't even bother to wait for the main course. Asked for manager who thankfully understand our frustration. Maybe because he is an Asian too.  He apologize profusely and very professionally asked if he can book us another reservation at other restaurant since it's late. Although I don't mind paying for the appetizers that we ate, he proceeded by taking care of the check. But hey, don't let my review stop you for eating here. Maybe just an off night for them or just because we live in a world of \"racial profiling\" these days. But honestly there should be no such thing in this world yet alone hospitality industry. Definitely wont be back.  Thanks costa di mare for ruining my wife's birthday dinner.",

I can still remember the details of the meal even today and we enjoyed this meal almost a month ago now. We had no idea what to order, so we just took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the chef's tasting menu. I'm happy we took the plunge because everything was just superb. It started with fresh bread and a little taste of soup. It then continued to appetizer (4 total), pasta course (3 total), then main course (1 to share), and finished off with two full desserts and gelato and sorbet tastings. Out of everything I would say the ribbon pasta was my absolute favorite along with the octopus appetizer. I've never had tender octopus in my life. It is so notorious for being chewy...but definitely not here. The waiters were all so accommodating and kind. I was so lost in the food that I forgot to take pictures.

I had a half bottle of Ruinart champagne and I also chose to do the smaller tasting menu (8 courses I think). I loved every single dish and I thought it was interesting that they brought out multiple courses at one time. Serving the food \"family style\" definitely had something to do with it. My favorite dish was definitely the anchovies. I have never had such fantastic anchovies in my life. For my dessert, they brought me 9 different gelato/sorbetti flavors as well as tiramisu. Wow, so awesome! My servers were excellent and extremely accommodating, my food was fantastic, and the ambiance was gorgeous. Definitely a great spot!",

    "text": "I was blown away by this place.  We had reserved a table out by the lagoon, which made this dinner the most romantic one we've had in Vegas.  Weather permitting, sit out there-  it's an entirely different experience!    The waiters are all imported directly from Italy, as is a large selection of wines.  For dinner, I had the Lasagnette con Ragu di Crostacei (\"rags\" of  pasta, crab, shrimp, langoustines, lobster, white wine, and tomato).  This is one of the best things I've ever eaten- the pasta was fresh and the seafood was perfect.    My fiance ordered the Agnolotti del Pin (classic Piemontese meat ravioli with brown butter and sage).  **I gotta say though, there is really no \"he ordered, I ordered\" with us.  We share everything.**  The ravioli was perfect as well.    Being the seafood eaters that we are, we couldn't resist sharing a small(ish) portion of the whole-fish John Dory.  It  seems weird to be eating fish that fresh in the dessert, but somehow they pull it off.  I didn't use the sauces they provided because the flavor and delicacy of the fish was enough for me to drool over.  Overall, Bartolotta is probably my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  It's hard not to go back every time we stay at the Wynn, but I'm too much of a foodie to start repeating now.",

I don't write recommendations on Yelp, instead I'm always making sure my friends and family get all of my reviews. But this was so exceptional it needed to be shared with everyone.",

    "text": "BEST DINING experience ive had in Las Vegas. Truly as good as it gets! 5 star EVERYTHING  My Birthday was Magical thanks to Wynn and the Bartolotta crew. I was waited on Hand and foot feeling like royalty.   This review is for my outdoor Lagoon Cabana table!! I heard so many good things about the outdoor seating that i booked months before my 23rd Birthday dinner.  I just NEEDED to experience all the hype. I was 100 percent in awe of the beautiful dining area.  All these negative reviews are because...? what? expense?... This is WYNN NOT CircusCircus, The seafood is flown in from Italy! Every nice restaurant in Las Vegas has pricy prices. Everyone seems to use \"Pretentious\" to describe Bartolotta. Not at all. If you're wearing a nike Tshirt and jordan sneakers, id turn you away too. This isint a buffet. Have some self respect for this resort and yourself! Las Vegas is where you flaunt whatever you have and PLAY HARD! Vegas means $. If you are seriously complaining about money issues, GO TO RENO! you damn cheapie. Why come to the Wynn or Encore and complain about the restaurants and club cover charges. If you can't afford Wynn, stay at Imperial Palace. If you cant get into XS or Surrender, go to LAX. Im far from rich, BUT come on, this is Las Vegas.  Enjoy the splurge and stop complaining.  Back to Bartolotta... I dined with my Mother and boyfriend, with reservations at 9;00PM. I was so excited the whole day for this meal. I was fully suited and groomed, ready for my Bday celebration. Note: that there is a 150$ minimum to sit outdoors. We brought along a special bottle of Dom Perignon from home. They charge a corkage fee and immediatly ice your bottle to your liking.  Bartolotta wont allow wine or champagne if they have the same bottle in stock. We made sure the Dom wasnt on the wine list. We were seated and immediatly our server came and introduced himself. Impressive that he spoke Italian. He scooted over the iced fish cart to show us the daily seafood options. Everything looked so delicious and fresh. We ordered Risotto Ai Frutti, Ravioli Ricota, and seared Sea scallops for appetizers. My mother and I split a Brazino (sea bass). It was enough for two people.The fish is charged 15.00 per 100 grams so dont be surprised when you get the bill! My boyfriend isint a seafood fan so he ordered the filetto di manzo (filet of beef). Nice that they have meat options for non seafood fans. I loved when the fish was served table side.Our server de-boned the bass with skill and precision.Obvious that he did this many many times.  Every dish was Delicious and beautiful to look at. Surprisingly, My bf's beef dish was amazing too! I was really pleased with the temperature of the meat. Then came dessert! chocolate pastry, ligurian lemon cake and my Favorite was the homemade gelato sampler (i think about 9 different flavors). All were different and flavorful.  To my surprise, our server brought out my very own Birthday dessert. I think it was a berry cheesecake slice with Happy Birthday written in chocolate. The bill came. Which was over 500$... WORTH EVERY CENT!!   Bartolotta made me feel like a king. THIS restaurant made my entire weekend one of the most memorable Vegas trips ever. I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT and will be back EVERY birthday or anniversary for top notch service, worthy of a VEGaS high roller.    Like i said, If you dont wanna go hard in Vegas, GO HOME!! Theres plenty of patrons waiting for your table here.....BYE FELICIA!!!!",

I ordered the Potato Gnocchi and Branzino, which came with potatoes and zucchini along with your choice of sauces. Both dishes were delicious. The gnocchi had great texture and melted in your mouth and the Branzino had fantastic flavor. The one fish condiment that was the best had tomatoes, olive oil and a few other ingredients--it hands down made the dish! I also had a delicious white wine with the meal. The only thing I would say was not perfectly on point was the service. We had 3-4 people on our table but they weren't in harmony. There would be lapses in time where no one would come over; we requested the sommelier to come over and he never did so our server jumped in to offer recommendations (which was very impressive); and then at the end of the meal we waited forever for our bill. I did appreciate that they brought us a complimentary dessert and after dinner drink---unexpected but appreciated. Other then that, I had a fantastic meal and would recommend this restaurant to others. Additional recommended dishes would be the scallops and octopus. The bread, which came with the meal, was nice and warm and pretty much melted in your mouth. Bravo to the Bartolotta team!",

The ambience was amazing sitting next to the quiet reflecting pool outside under the canopies, though I do wish there was no smoking out there as well (I mean, you seriously can't wait an hour for another smoke?)  The waitstaff were well educated and helpful at guiding us through the menu selections...especially the myriad of mostly Mediterranean fish about as fresh as you can get without sitting on the boat.  The octopus salad was perfectly tender and flavorful, the handmade pasta and risotto capped out that course hardly leaving room for the entrees.  I had the veal (oh my goodness was it tender) and we shared an occhiona (Red Sea bream) that was perfectly prepared. Our server took great care to bone the fish and plate it for us.  We didn't care for the the potatoes and zucchini, but those were the only leftovers from this feast.  Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert, but the selection was delectable.  Be prepared for a hefty price tag, but you pay for quality in the ambience as well as in the preparation and freshness of the meal.",

    "text": "I'm so glad I didn't pay for this overpriced meal.  Honestly, I did pay attention to the fact that Bartolotta hails his seafood from the Mediterranean itself, but to tell you the truth, I wish the seafood was better.  I've had better dishes from Michael Mina restaurants, so I was expecting more from this place.    Let me tell you, I'm a big fan of seafood.  In Asia, we eat it morning, noon, and night.  Raw.  See how bad ass that is?.. we can't even wait to cook our fish.  First off, the decor inside doesn't impress me.  It seems like any cliche fancy restaurant, and really nothing special.  You want Las Vegas-standard restaurant interior, you go to Barmasa or Tao.  Bartolotta's outside patio is much, much more impressive though.  The cabanas are pretty cozy and the seating overlooks a pond with floating silver globes and koi fish.  Let me clear that up, the koi fish aren't floating.... just the globes.  Also, the waitstaff seemed alright.  They were very polite and a majority of them were Italian-speaking.  They held a conversation very well and were quite attentive, but I'm docking points because there's a certain standard of menu knowledge and knowing the restaurant's background that I hold all waistaffs.  They didn't show any evidence of the either.  My visit at Bartolotta is as clear as day since it wasn't too long ago that I went, so let me give you a summary of the dishes we ordered.  Ligurian octopus salad- A LARGE portion for an appetizer.  If I had another order, I would've been borderline full.  I don't mind that, of course.  Seafood risotto- HORRIBLE.  It was like porridge.  I'm not kidding you, and I\"m not exaggerating.  PORRIDGE.  Huge shrimps- Sorry, I can't remember their Italian name, but they were nothing special.  They weren't even that big at all.  Branzino- I've always wanted to try this fish because I heard it's kind of a staple dish in Mediterranean seafood cuisine.  I was disappointed again.  My dad could cook a better bass that he spear-caught singlehandedly in the South China Sea.  Beat that, Bartolotta.  But seriously, I guess if your wallet was bottomless and you just wanted to be able to say you've eaten at Bartolotta, then go for it.  Or you can save your money.. save the shrimps, Branzinos, octopi, and Little Mermaid's friends their plane fare from their Italian home and come to Michael Mina or something where they get fish natively and cook it twice as good.",

    "text": "There was a group of 8 of us who went down to Vegas for a stag. We were very excited for a nice fine dining experience and had heard a lot of great things about Bartolotta. Unfortunately the experience did not live up to the hype. Upon arriving for our 8:00 pm reservation we were informed our table was not ready yet. We waited about half an hour for our table, but enjoyed some pretty tasty cocktails in the meantime. We decided to all order the chefs tasting menu as we felt we would get the most bang for our buck and have the ability to try as much of the menu as possible. The wine list was quite expansive and we ordered a nice bottle that was told would go well with all the fish we would be having.   The appetizers came out first, and there were a lot of them. The dishes that stood out were the scallops which were cooked perfectly and topped with parmiagiano reggiano, and sardines drizzled in a delicious olive oil and vinegar. The rest of the dishes were good but nothing really stood out as memorable. The one overall complaint I would say about the meal was that there was almost little to not presentation with the dishes. Understood that it was served family style but it almost seemed like we were eating at my grandmas house. Not the type of service you would expect at a fine dining establishment such as Bartolotta.   The pasta dishes were next. Again nothing to really brag home about. As a disclaimer, all 8 of us were raised in Italian households, so our expectations for pasta dishes are quite high. But even a non-Italian or someone with an undeveloped palate would be able to tell that this was a low standard of pasta. The worst of the bunch (about 6 pasta dishes were served), was the risotto that was severely undercooked and lacked flavor. The rigatoni with red scorpion fish was also really dry.   The whole cooked fish served table side was next. The presentation of the fish was somewhat neat, but the fish itself was not very appealing and the cucumber lemon sauce served with did nothing to help the flavor.   Last was the dessert. At this point we were all stuffed so the food barely was touched. We each tried a few items and although a few were good, most were pretty awful. One in particular was the semi freddo in olive oil which was actually not edible. One thing I will say is that we did get a lot of food based on what we paid. But as I have mentioned the quality and uniqueness of the food was less than impressive. There are a lot of high quality restaurants in Vegas, but this is one you can definitely skip if you're looking for something special.",

I'm no Anthony Bourdain, but I've been to a fair amount of restaurants across the tier/quality gamut across this great country of ours...and this is by far one of the, if not the, very best overall restaurant experience I've ever had. The service was great, the cart they wheel around is a great \"look what we just flew in from the Mediterranean, you assholes\" visual ... though it was a little cheesy to see the very competent, professional servers wheel that thing around like they were churro vendors at dodger stadium. The food? Ridiculi. That's when just one \"ridiculous\" won't do so you have to make up words to pluralize it up a little.   We even sat close to guy who looked like \"Fez\" from \"That 70s Show\" and acted like Fez on a combination of Methamphetimine and Two Buck Chuck...and we still had a great time.  Now I am going back to Vegas again, and this place was a big part of that. Damn you Bartolotta. See you shortly.",

    "text": "I have memory loss from my experience at Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare. Maybe, it's from the drinks and wine we had prior to dinner. From what I recall, we ordered the Top Chef tasting menu comprised of 11+ or so courses from edible mini crab, octopus to squid ink risotto. We had salt crusted fish with fresh fish flown that day from the Mediterranean Sea. Honestly, that's all I could remember along with the multiple courses of desserts they served. Service was great.. Better be for the 6 bottles of $300/ea of wine we had!  Keep it coming!!",

    "text": "We had reservations at Bartolotta in the Wynn for our post-wedding dinner. I wanted to sit outside in the cabanas, but were informed when we arrived at the venue that it was closed due to weather. I did not make the reservation there for the food, which was ok, but for the atmosphere- I wanted for a romantic over-the-top wedding dinner. The location was the key to the choice I made. If the staff knew it would be closed I would have liked to have been informed earlier in the day, so I could have picked a more intimate dinner location. As it was, we sat in the middle of the restaurant, no privacy, and it was loud. We were 'stuck' because I thought they had made a special cake I requested. Turned out it was a 'fake cake' we could only photograph, and two very very small pieces of cake. I was almost in tears...... I was very disappointed, and it was a once in a lifetime occasion. In the future, if you see that a couple is specifically celebrating a special night, perhaps a phone call with a suggestion of an alternate 'like' location would be warranted.",

We were seated in a beautiful private room to the right of the bar and were all super excited to be dining there.  For pasta, the price is way too high, however, the ambiance, service, and taste are all up to par with the status of the Wynn Hotel so I guess you can't expect to pay less.  I highly recommend the Risotto appetizer and the Chicken entree.  Both are cooked to perfection.  The lasagna is also scrumptious.  I think everything else is pretty mediocre so just take your time to breathe in scenery and ambiance.  If you are looking for a great meal, relax, order a salad, an appetizer pasta and one of their famous fish entree's.  If I come back, I am definitely going to have to try their fish.  If you want to drink alcohol, expect to fork out a Benjamen.",

    "text": "Dear John,  Since we couldn't get a table till it became god awfully late, we decided to sit at the bar and have our meal and it was our great misfortune to have landed you as our bartender/waiter. I know you are a bartender and your job is to get us drinks primarily but not filling a water glass for our entire dinner when you're at the bar might be a cardinal sin in your line of work. You didn't offer us a dessert menu, didn't take our order, watched through the corner of your eye as we waited for some kind of attention and just generally decided we were not worth your bartender's time of day. John, you are not only an awful bartender but might also be quite a terrible person.   We ordered from the vegetarian/vegan menu. For starters we had a tomato based soup with zucchini and basil. Probably the only good item for the night. It was really more of a reduction and not a soup but the point is, it tastes good. My starter was the Cocotte Parmigianno Reggiano. A custard made with strong Parmesan flavors and topped with mushrooms and brussel sprout leaves. An intriguing presentation but since I left more than half of the thimble-sized portion I'm going to go with advising you not to order this.   For our mains we got 2 half portions of risotto. The whipped vegetable risotto was not all that bad but I have nothing resounding to add about it. The other risotto that comprised peas, asparagus and herbs was an assault to every taste bud I had. One bite and I was done. Forever.   Since John, you did not bother to get us a dessert menu or take our order, we were kind of put off and skipped dessert.   1 star goes to your \"assistant\" bartender Gustavo, who tried very hard to make up for your ineptness. 1 star goes to the fact that you offer 1/2 portions on the vegan/veg menu for all the pasta offerings.   The abhorrent service and disastrous food sealed this place as a \"No-go\" on my Vegas Italian list. With Sinatra a few yards away, it's absolutely pointless to even step into this travesty known as Bartollota.  Furthermore, on our way back to the Encore parking lot, my eyes were assailed by the lines of people with copious amounts of hair gel and the tightest, most uncomfortable outfits ever known to mankind trying to make their way into their mecca known as Xcess.  If anyone wants Italian here, please make your way to Sinatra and steer miles away from this joint.   Sincerely Sang.",

I've been to many fine dining establishments, but this place doesn't deserve to be on the LV Strip. Everything tasted VERY bland. Nothing creative about this place at all. I spent the same amount on dinner as I did at Providence in Los Angeles and let me tell you... Providence is facking AMAZING! Worth every penny. Bartolotta...? What happened?   Service: Friendly. Funny. Knowledgeable.  Ligurian Octopus Salad: Fresh. Tasteless. Nothing spectacular here. Presentation was mediocre. I guess I shouldn't expect much from an octopus salad.  Sheep's Milk Ricotta Ravioli: Meh. Didn't taste like much. Really, I couldn't even taste cheese.  Turbot: This was the whole fish we ordered for my boyfriend and I to share by the recommendation of our server. I don't know what to say here, only that it was cooked well - moist and tender, but like all other dishes it was tasteless. I almost wanted to ask for salt but didn't want to offend our server who recommended it and the chef (who obviously prepared it).   The only decent dish here was their complimentary dessert. My boyfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary and the server brought out a rich chocolate cake with ice cream. THAT was delicious! The rest of dinner... not so much.",

From a service and looks standpoint, the restaurant has few equals ( as most thing inside the Wynn). These tastes you'll find here will be preferred tastes; Some might find it to be world class, some might find it to be too fancy.   Prices are expensive. Id recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to explore different Italian flavors from the usual, and Id warn others who are not as adventurous.   Once again this style and flavor food isnt my favorite, so thats why I rate it like this, but im sure this restaurant is very capable of giving someone else a 5 star experience.....im also sure someone can have a 1 star experience ( not by restaurant look or staff, but by taste)",

Unfortunately it didn't fulfill that lofty expectation.  1st we had to wait 30 mins past our reservation though that could be in part to a rain/thunder storm closing the outdoor terrace. We were comped drinks while waiting.  The main dining room is downstairs and it reminded me of going to Postrio's in San Francisco. Very nice interior.  Our waiter wheeled out a cart displaying the fresh fish for that night and explained the types of fish and recommended how many a fish might serve. Unfortunately, that's were the service kinda ended.   Our combos were: Sardines/Rib-Eye ?/Rack of Lamb Risotto/Rack of Lamb Beef tartare/roasted Guinea hen  All were good but the drop-off in attention ruined the over-all experience. After the initial pour we had to pour the rest of wine. We weren't checked in after our entrees came. Now all this actually happened after the restaurant became less full. In fact, by the time our entrees came, the restaurant was half full. Now unless they sent home half the staff too, you'd think they be around alittle more.  Now, apologies from the main dining room manager.  Hopefully a bad night but doubt I'd be back.",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews but I went to Vegas recently and thought it would be a great idea to review all the places I visited. I dined at this restaurant Sunday Nov. 8th. I'll preface this by saying that my server was nice, the sommelier, even the runner( I assume he was the busser). But this isn't my first fine dining experience. The food was meh. I had the asparagus salad. It cost me $22 and tasted greasy. It was bit bland and didn't have much flavor. Next I had the sheep's milk ravioli. This dish was really salty but maybe it's down to the way I generally prepare food at home. There were maybe six ravioli on my plate.This cost about $18. The server told me that truffles were $19 extra so being adventurous I said sure. Well those truffles turned out to be $90. But the manager adjusted my bill so I'm happy with that. To round out the meal I had a $14 glass of wine. It did the trick. I was willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt but I had told my server before that I was going to see Cirque du Soleil KA at the MGM Grand and that I would likely need to leave early. But he was more concerned with making sure that I made the restaurant as much money as possible. I got to the MGM Grand with 10 minutes to spare. If restuarants were like clothing stores and I could request a refund, I would. The food was decent but not worth the nearly $90 I spent. They brought out cake because I told them I was celebrating a late birthday. I could only take two bites because by this point I needed to leave.  FYI I am vegetarian and I was not impressed by that teeny tiny menu they brought out. I don't even think they listed all the vegetarian dishes the restaurant has. Vegas has much better food than this and for less too.",

    "text": "Short summary: food okay, not memorable, definitely not worth the exorbitant price.   Details:  We were at Costa Di Mare a couple of years ago and were truly blown away by the food - it was a truly amazing experience, worth every penny. On this visit, things changed significantly, and unfortunately, for the worse.  Not that the food was bad, it was basically okay, but it certainly did not justify the ridiculous prices.   The policy of charging \"per 100 grams\", while popular in Europe, makes it very confusing to estimate the final cost of the meal.  $70-80 fish entrees are priced similar to Le Bernardin in NYC, with none of the flair or magic touch.  Salt-crusted fish was nice and tender but that's it.  The lobster?  Hold on to your seat: $170.  Since the only price on the menu is \"per 100 grams\", good luck figuring it out beforehand.  Side of bland roasted vegetables would be an embarrassment to any self-respecting chef.  The final $400+ bill was definitely NOT worth it.   There are plenty of fine dining options in LV that do not insult your intelligence.  Skip.",

Couple with the high prices/high expectations I had the place which was the last star deducted, I am sorry to say but you can do better elsewhere at the other restaurants at Wynn or on the Las Vegas Strip.   Save up a lot for the Joel Robuchon/Guy Savoy level, find other comparable ones - there are a lot as it is after all Las Vegas, or find something cheaper nearby - if it's cheap enough I'll clean the fish myself for the chef.",

We were arriving that evening so I wanted something in the hotel and a nice dinner that would appease my snobby food/wine side and my boyfriend's finicky side. Mission accomplished! The entry into the dining area is above a beautiful winding staircase. The place just oozes elegance. It was like a birthday gift having my waiter be from Dublin and I got to listen to him talk all night! I wish I could remember his name but he was the best! The fish case was a spectacular site and although I am NOT a seafood girl, my bf is and he ordered the scorpion fish. Watching them prepare it to be plated at the table, picking out the bones and adding vegetables and sauce right in front of us was amazing! I almost wanted to try it, but no thanks. I went with, you guessed it, the filet. By the way, one of my favorite dishes and this one was probably in my top 3 anywhere!! Including the grass fed filet I had in a castle in Ireland! It was that good! I only wished I had more room in my stomach. After salads, bread with butter accompaniments, entrees and then a special dessert for my birthday I was full until lunch time the next day!! This restaurant was sooooo amazing, I would literally go back to Vegas just to eat there again.",
