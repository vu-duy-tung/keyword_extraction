For carb lovers: the mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, and Mac and cheese would be a great addition. Service is good, but servicing a party of 12 is hard for one person.",

The mint juleps are delicious and refreshing, the warm bread and honey butter is awesome, the happy hour rib tips are affordable, flavorful, and filling, and the atmosphere (especially at the one at the district) is very cool and laid back.    If you like good food and a great happy hour, definitely give Lucille's a try!",

Neither of us could finish the food as they were pretty large portions, but we didn't leave overstuffed either. In regards to service, I can't say anything negative. Some of the best service we had in Vegas.   Overall, not the best BBQ I've had, but still great. What we did think was amazing was their lemonades. $4/$5 each with fee refills and worth it. And again, the service sticks out.  Recommended? YES",

Let's start with waitress who would be talking as she was walking away like she had better things to do other that take my order. But then came the food which my beef rib was like a hard bone. Coleslaw had zero taste but then who cares because once u got there beef ribs did you  really wanna taste anything else they serve?  We made the trek from the strip thinking it was a local BBQ hangout , instead we got a corporate chain....  Now I know my BBQ, and fly to Austin just for it. And this place is no BBQ standout. So my advice is stay away.",

We were a party of 8. We all order different things and shared. The only thing that was neither here nor there was the onion straws. Brisket, sausage, chicken (roasted&fried) ribs, brisket, cornbread all were TERRIFIC! Definitely recommend! Delicious! No question will be back. We're back in Vegas b4 we leave. Yummm!

The brisket is inconsistent, but when it's good, it's the best I've ever had. Even when it's not their best, it's still better than the other places in town. Their sides are always good, whether veggies, beans, succotash (OMG the succotash!), mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, and also the best coleslaw in Vegas, not my favorite of all time, but the best in Vegas. Both the peach and strawberry lemonades are made with fresh fruit puree and are so thirst quenching and deelicious!! This place only lacks at making BBQ sauce. Sonny's Sweet and maybe even Sweet Baby Ray's is better. Sometimes we get food to go and put our own sauce on at home. That being said, their MOP SAUCE is killer! I always order mop sauce on the side. With the mop sauce, I don't even think about their BBQ sauces.  The portobello cheese brisket sandwich is also really good if you're not in the mood for a meat plate.",

One-star level of food here, no hyperbole. (Well, maybe a little.)  Now, I am no goddamn expert on barbecue (I have only made pilgrimages to Austin, KC, Memphis, and Nashville for barbacoa though, and actually saw firsthand how all originally derived in a Taino reserve), but what I have been served here at Lucille's was simply not good food.   Did not taste good, did not look good; made me want to strive to become vegan. If I were forced to eat all of my meat exclusively from Lucille's, or of a Lucille-like quality, I would become vegan. No bullshit. I would basically become Morrissey.   Service The one waiter we had did not (a) know what was it that came with the largest pre-packaged combo on their own menu -- like no shit ... had no clue at all -- ; and (b) did not bring everything that was supposed to come with the combo from their very own menu after studying it at fucking length! Sucks.  Ambiance I have been to Heavy Metal concerts that were kinder to my hearing. And I have also been to private invite events at Wynn fucking Resorts that had less pretentious yuppies than Lucille's in The District at GVR, Henderson, NV, U.S.A..   Dude, turn down the fucking volumes on those goddamn amps in the bar; this is not an arena or Lollapalooza. It is a fucking restaurant!  Epilogue Overpriced. And it sucks. The holy duo for I-won't-be-caught-dead-in-this-shithole-again for me. That is just me; this might be the greatest eats you have ever had in your life for you though. We are all different, after all. - E  Postscript. There should be another noise level choice: \"Airplane Engines Right Next To Your Fucking Ears Loud\" in between \"Very Loud\" and \"Not Sure[.]\"",

It is a premade patty now- GAAAAHHHHH  Service is still lacking- GAAHAHAHAHAHA  We came here for my brother's graduation and called it in a week before. So one would think they would be prepared for us. No. Not at all. We got our drinks after 20min, then finally got our food orders in after 30min along with our sugary biscuits, which I am starting to suspect is the only thing good here. Our waitress was slow, and I know she didn't have any other tables because we were there pretty late and there were only a few other tables, with enough waiters to take care of them. Not only that but she clearly had no idea what the menu consisted of. If it was her first night, I can understand. But since her fuck ups were on one thing only (the Super family meal we ordered) it stands to reason that she just sucks at her job. First she messed up the amount of sides the meal comes with- which I had to point out, which was fine. She looked it over on the menu and corrected herself. Now, I say she looked at the menu because later when she was asked when the salad was suppose to come out, she countered with \"Salad doesn't come with that.\" You just looked at it. Yes, it does.   But really the question I should be asking, is who the hell in the kitchen forgot about it as well? Doesn't she put in the order and they make it? What the hell is wrong with these people?",

The sweet tea is also a favorite of mine. Chicken wings here are ---Spicy--- and delicious. Creamy coleslaw is something I will also order and pick up from here it is so wonderful. I've never had a bad experience here service wise. Only thing holding this place back from a 5/5 is that its just a generic kind of chain, it doesn't have that extra umph or character to set it apart especially in this unique town.  If you want good BBQ and are in Green Valley, I don't think there is anywhere else you should go.",

    "text": "As a Southerner from North Carolina, I had some issues. First, the food is not that good (more details to follow)... Second, the restaurant was described as a mix of various Southern flavors, that probably don't necessarily all go together (e.g. the grits). Third, as a black person, the \"art\" (i.e. black people outside mowing lawns and picking cotton... I may be exaggerating, but they were doing some type of yard work), is a bit much, especially next to portraits of Billy Holiday, etc.  Food (3/5) To start, I had the fried pickles, which are spears and not slices... the breading was good and the ranch dressing was on par with other restaurants; however, the mustard was interesting, for sure. The biscuits are delicious, but I couldn't help thinking that the added sugar on top is a bit unnecessary, especially when you're having a Sweet Tea. In addition, I had the half barbecue chicken which was tasty, but a tad on the dry side. The rib tips were served about lukewarm and equated to about maybe 2 oz of food, while the pulled pork was not flavorful, and definitely lackluster. I first ordered the cheese grits, aka the pimiento grits, because that's what they taste like... I also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, which in my opinion, had too much garlic. I like garlic, I do, and I use it in almost every dish I cook, but they just weren't all that good. I suppose I expect food to be as good or better than if I cooked it, but perhaps my expectations are high.  Eventually, my sides were replaced with Macaroni & Cheese and the Baked Beans, which when eaten together, were pretty well seasoned. The beans were probably the highlight, and the mac & cheese was served steaming hot, but lacking salt. I finished the meal with the banana pudding, which was good pudding, but just that. Traditional banana pudding has layers with vanilla wafers, that have sat in the pudding and are soft, with yummy ripe bananas, but this was just pudding with freshly cut banana and crispy vanilla wafers topped with whipped cream. :(  Service (2/5) I did talk to a manager during my meal because I could see the server was \"in the weeds,\" so I took my issues (not with him) but with the food, to her, but either way, he was not very good. Maybe he's new, not sure really, but I definitely have tried to make eye contact with him for the last fifteen minutes to order my dessert, but he has not walked this way as of yet. He dropped off the check earlier, but I mentioned at the beginning of my meal that I would be for sure trying the banana pudding... 'tis a Southern classic. As I'm typing this, I've watched him cash out three tables, and walk by a number of times. My plate is pushed away from me, and I keep looking around, but I'm literally in front of him, so he can't help but see me. As to his service previous to my food issues, I had literally just taken a bite of the pickles when he stopped and waited for me to respond about the quality. With my mouth full, I had to say something to get him not to wait and stare at me blankly for a response. In addition, he never got me a refill, that was the manager...",

    "text": "Truly, the perfect summer food is BBQ and this restaurant did not disappoint.  My family came here for lunchtime and their lunch menu was decently priced for the amount of food we were about to eat.  Located right at The District next to Green Valley Resort casino, parking was easy and the location is not hard to find.  Inside there is a separate bar area as well as a section for booths/tables.  I believe there is happy hour options at the bar only.  We opted to share the BBQ Platter in the not crowded at all restaurant section.  A choice of baby back ribs or st. louis style spare ribs along with two choices of other meats including tri-tip, beef brisket burnt ends, a quarter chicken, sausage, etc.  We had the baby back ribs, brisket burnt ends and the quarter chicken.  The baby back ribs were pretty good.  Nice amount of meat to it which came off the bone fairly easily.  Good flavors enhanced by one of Lucille's 3 bbq sauces on the table.  The sauces were Memphis-style (tangy bbq), original (mild standard smoky bbq flavor)  and a hot bbq sauce (felt tobasco-sauce based).    The burnt ends were cooked very well.  So moist, good amount of meat and just a very little amount of fat to just give it a flavorful bite.     The quarter chicken (thigh and leg) was also cooked very well.  Not dry at all.   Tasty as chicken could be.    We also had potato salad as our side which was fine as far as potato salads go.  My daughter had the mac-n-cheese kid's meal with shoestring fries.   There are plenty of options for kid's meals here.  It's good to know there is an option for every picky kid out there.  We also had a strawberry lemonade.  All of their drinks come out in large mason jars.  Very cool to drink out of and I assume all should be happy because it means less time spent on things like refilling water and more time enjoying lunch/dinner.  Now let me end this review by actually talking about the starter complimentary biscuits.  Because wow, damn, so so good!  When it comes out, it doesn't look like much.  Biscuits with apple butter.   However..   Looks can be deceiving!  The biscuits were actually powdered with a bit of sugar and they were insanely soft and fluffy.  I really thought the biscuits would be \"meh\" just by looking at them.   However, that apple butter on those biscuits were heavenly.  We had them bring more.  The servers were friendly, quick, and attentive.  No complaints.  An overall good spot for lunch.  I would definitely try this out again when the BBQ crave returns!!",

    "text": "A Family Friendly BBQ.   I've been here a few times now and still nothing really \"wows\" me. The food is good, but not great and honestly, \"family friendly\", restaurants just don't do it for me; I usually come here out of pure convenience.   Now, if it's just you and a friend or your date, I recommend sitting at the bar. You don't have to wait in line to sit and the service at the bar is much faster and the bartenders here all awesome, insanely attentive and your beer or water glass is never empty.    This time around I tried the Brisket Burnt Ends, Southern Fried Dill Pickles and the Smoked Burnt Ends Salad. Burnt ends are good way to gauge a BBQ's place food. These should be like meat-butter and have almost no fat on them, but Lucille's burnt ends have a little more fat than I would like and are a tad chewy. This is the second time I've ordered these meat nuggets and this seems to be the norm.   The fried pickles are very good. The only \"beef\" (ha) I have with is these is the crispy outside, it never stays on after the first bite. This is something that's synonymous with all fried pickles.   The meat filled salad was very good, but loaded to the brim with onions. I mean there had to be at least one full red onion in this salad. The brisket was plentiful and the flavor was there, when not being overpowered by onions. If you're a lover of salads, this is definitely worth a try, but ask for onions on the side unless you absolutely love that stinky vegetable.   Looking for a cookie cutter BBQ joint that gets the job the done? Look no further.",

This was great! I think at least 5 different people were at our table! So yes, service was on point!   We had the \"Feast For Two\" the sides were good, the mac n cheese was the best part of the meal! Very tasty! The baby back ribs were tasty as well but the chicken and brisket was least desirable. I didn't taste the beans but the hubs said they were \"okay.\" I also ordered some corn bread, it was subpar. The Peach cobbler was alright, not sure I want to waste the calories on that.   We tried something different, and the food was okay, but the service again was great!",

    "text": "Wow this place had gone way down hill since the last time I was here. My main issue is with the food. Their BBQ used to be great and I had thought it was one of the better BBQ joints in town. But this time around the meat was dry and inedible in my opinion. I'm from Texas, where lean, overcooked, dry brisket goes straight to the trash instead of being served. Also, who chops their brisket without advertising it as such? Brisket should never be chopped, always sliced! It's not pulled pork so if you want to serve it chopped then state so in the menu!   Service was another issue as our server kept appearing at all the wrong times. Basically when we needed something, like the check, he was nowhere to be found for long periods of time. And yet he kept stopping by and interrupting us when we didn't need anything at all. How annoying!  I left this meal feeling very disappointed and dissatisfied. I basically felt like I wasted a bunch of money because nothing about the meal was enjoyable or memorable. Will likely not be returning and definitely not recommending to others!",

I had no idea this was a chain restaurant, but I did not get that feeling at all. It was a nice, clean restaurant with easy parking. The staff was very prompt and kind throughout the entire dinner.   To begin, the server brought baskets of sweet biscuits with apple butter (unlimited quantity) and this was SOOOOO GOOD! We ordered the sweet tea and peach lemonade etc, all come in gigantic mason jars with unlimited refills, so definitely well worth your money.   Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! The fried chicken, the chicken in some spicy sauce, brisket, catfish, RIBS! The baby back ribs were the best ribs I have ever had. The barbecue sauce was smoky, yet sweet--so so good! Each of the sides was delicious as well! We loved the mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, and garlic mashed potatoes. The serving sizes are gigantic and definitely large enough to share.   The staff was very sweet and brought out a chocolate cupcake ice cream sandwich, topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and sprinkles, with a candle for my birthday. And they brought hot towels for everyone at the end to clean their hands.   If you sign up for Lucille's online club, you can get $5 off your bill.   Very, very, very reasonable prices for such massive amounts of scrumptious food! Will definitely be back!",

The place was 3/4 empty so the poor service can't be blamed on her being busy.  The biscuits that are usually so good were brought to our table ice cold and so stale they crumbled into tiny pieces when picked up.  Another server brought us another basket of biscuits that were actually worse than the first basket.  That server explained their previous baker was hired by another restaurant and they currently have no one on staff who can make biscuits.  That may be, but it doesn't explain why they are served cold and stale.  My husband's meal came out with the wrong side.  The cole slaw was drowning in mayo and inedible.  The BBQ beans were good but room temperature.  The brisket was chewy and somewhat stringy.  What have you done to this formerly great restaurant??  Are you unable to attract good cooks & servers??  $53 for two meals and we left unsatisfied.  It is our last visit.",

I ordered a southern lemonade and the sausage trio to start. The lemonade is BOMB and strong af so be careful.

There is not much of a waiting area either and the checkin desk becomes over crowded at most times and you can barely make your way to them to provide your party information. On this occasion, we had reservations which reduced our wait time. We were seated in one of time side rooms. Our waitress was attentive and drinks and orders were taken promptly. Food portions are well portioned, so come hungry! I had the shrimp salad which was delicious! Honestly, this place is usually hit or miss, food is always good, however service and large (loud) crowds can often put a damper on the dining experience. Parking is always an issue near the restaurant as well since it is located in the green valley district area.",

    "text": "We came here after my niece's 1st Communion. We got there not long after they opened but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get the table ready. Lu was our server and he was pretty peppy.   After taking our drink orders..it seemed like FOREVER until he came back with our drinks and biscuits. Granted we did have more than 15 people in our party but another server helped out and brought out ONE cup of coffee to help Lu out.  After handing out all of our drinks we were ready with our orders. My sis and I ordered the BBQ Two Meat Combo Platter with beef ribs and St. Louis ribs. For our sides we got the mac and cheese and braised greens.  It's been awhile since I've been to a Lucille's but I did remember that their biscuits were good and their drinks are served in large mason jars. The strawberry lemonade was a little on the sweet side but still good. My sister ordered a Peach Moon which had Blue Moon beer, peach schnapps, and orange juice. I had a taste of it and it was really good.  Our food came not too long after which we were very relieved we didn't have to wait that long compared to our drinks. The beef ribs were tasty. However the ribs weren't consistent. One was tender while the other was overcooked and tough. I've come to the realization that I don't like St. Louis ribs. This was probably the third time trying it and it's not my cup of tea. Unless all three places just didn't cook them right. The mac and cheese was just ok, as well as the greens. I tried some of the sweet potato friends and those were sooooo good! My sis and I both agreed it's probably one of the best we've had. They were very crispy but still was creamy when you bit into it. I also liked the Cajun spice sprinkled on it.  For dessert we shared a red velvet cake a la mode. Unfortunately they forgot the ice cream but served it after. The cake was just ok to me. The frosting was a little too sweet for me.   Overall it was a good meal and besides the slow beginning, Lu was friendly and attentive. I'm not from Vegas so I probably won't come back to this location but I'd go back to the one in my area. The Peach Moon is a very refreshing drink!",

We split the chocolate cake for dessert, very moist and decadent without   the frosting being sickly sweet. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We ventured here on a rainy Friday night in search of some delicious BBQ and potent drinks. This restaurants is not inside of Green Valley Ranch, as another reviewer claimed. It is located in The District across from GVR, next to King's Fish House.  The parking was an absolute nightmare. After circling around in the vicinity with three other cars trailing us, we were forced to park in the lot near REI store. The parking lot was a great indication of the wait for a table. When we got into the restaurant the hostess informed us it would be about 30-35 minute way. We decided to wait it. Fighting a spot to wait where you weren't in somebody's way was the tricky part since the bar was also full, and they had a live band performing. Eventually the bar cleared up and we got some drinks. Kentucky tea for me (props to the bartender who took the time to google how to make it) and a Sam Adams for the boyfriend. As we were paying for our drinks our buzzer goes off. Happy days!  We are seated at a little oddball table near the patio entrance. The server brings us some waters and asks if it was our first time there. We nod unanimously. The server is super friendly and energetic and explains the set up, points out the smokers inside of the restaurant and explains the three different sauces offered: Lucille's Memphis (vinegary, more traditional sauce), Lucille's Original (tomato based with molasses/sweet and tangy), Lucille's Hot & Spicy (a little bit of a kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy).  He brought us over a couple of fresh biscuits with the apple cinnamon butter. Yum!  We started off with an appetizer of BBQ Rib Tip - half portion that was plenty! ($8.99) These were succulent and tasty. I would highly recommend.  As an entree I opted for Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich ($13.49).. the taste was excellent and the meat was not dry, but it definitely did benefit from extra sauce. Although it is marinated in original sauce, I opted to add Memphis sauce on top of it. It gave it an interesting flavor, and added moisture did not hurt either. As my side I opted for mac and cheese which was pretty standard and not memorable in any way.  Boyfriend opted for the ever so popular Lucille's Original Pulled Pork Sandwich ($10.99) It was great especially with the Memphis style sauce. He had a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which once again, were just a forgettable filler.  I had another Kentucky tea before we called it a night. The server was great without being over bearing. He seemed to appear only when we did actually need something (another drink, water refill, a box to go). Otherwise he didn't pop in ever minute interrupting dinner. Huge props to him.  Lucille's offers great BBQ for Henderson folk. It gets crowded so make a reservation. The sides were not that great, but overall food was delicious and service was flawless. I will be trying it for their happy hour which I am told is from 4pm-6pm and they have some great food specials during that time. Yipee!",

My guess is that business has slowed so someone made the decision of cutting costs by cutting down on the portions.   First off we were a party of three and they brought us only two biscuits. Could have been an honest mistake here but it didn't get any better when the food arrived.   I ordered the two meat combo with tri tip and baby back ribs ($27.99). It comes with two side so I got the Mac n cheese and bake potato. When the food arrived I was shocked to see only 4 slices of tri tip and 5 baby back ribs! For $28 this is a pretty cabs deal! I usually get the two meat combo and i usually have leftovers to take home but not this time. I ended up eating the entire plate of food and was still hungry. Sadly this was the same experience the others in my party had.   If you don't believe me, just look at the photos that people have posted 1-2years ago to today's photos. They even stop serving watermelon slices with their food. You have to order it as a side now!   Anyways, a great BBQ place is now not so great. The food might still be good but it's no longer worth the value. $28 value to be exact.",

When we finally did catch one of their attention, she asked me if I'd like a drink, but not my date. She was polite, just not incredibly perceptive.   When we sat down, our server came to the table and gave us a really awkward hello and when I said, \"how's your evening?\", he launched into telling us how \"exhausted\" he was and then tried to correct by saying it was because he was \"so busy taking excellent care of his guests.\" Weird.   Not to mention the food runner who just dropped the food without saying anything.   Food was good, not great. We had beef ribs and they weren't as juicy or meaty as I had hoped. Their Sauces are just ok...none of them made me want to keep licking my fingers. The Mac and cheese was tasty, but it's real hard to screw that up and the fried green tomatoes were yummy, but we didn't get enough time to enjoy them because our entree came out only a couple minutes after our appetizer.   I would like to try Lucille's again but for the baby back ribs and hopefully service will be a little but better.",

I've been there enough times to go back but probably because friends wanna go there and it's one of the most well known barbecue spots. the last time I was there I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. (ballin on a budget). I mean, it was good, but it wasn't the greatness my mouth was expecting. I kept having to dip it in the barbecue sauce(s). I also ordered the sweet tea. I like my sweet tea so sweet that I feel like I'm gonna get diabetes any minute. Theirs was watered down or something.  On another note, the service provided the last time I went was sub par. They took forever to order and deliver our food. I wanted ice cream with my bread pudding and they.......  couldn't find the ice cream? hunh.  Maybe it was a bad visit? Like I said, I've been there enough to where I'm willing to go back if someone else suggests it, but I'm not gonna be the one to throw out the suggestion.",

I ordered their strawberry lemonade, and I love it! They come out in cute mason jars, so dont be alarmed if you think they just washed out a jelly jar for your drink.   The three individuals I was with ordered the half a rack of ribs, and it was just ridiculously huge (I wonder what the full looks like). I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Also, while we were waiting for our food, they brought out biscuits. They were amazing, like fresh out of the oven... and the apple butter is just awesome.   What I liked about the pulled pork sandwich here was that it wasnt slathered with BBQ sauce... and messy. It actually came out as if some one had freshly pulled the meat. And I got to put as little, or as much, BBQ sauce as I wanted. I didnt have that feeling like I have with other pulled pork sandwiches that I am consuming a sauce sandwich instead.   For the BBQ lovers, this is def a place to try out.",

Instant seating, and then the host walked us through the restaurant & out the back door, then through all of the patio seating to a table next to the front door.  Brilliant!  We should have kept walking... (sigh)  Hubby's sweet tea wasn't, so he added sugar... And the biscuits & apple butter were seriously nom.  The 1/2 appetizer platter sounded like a good solution to appetizer confusion, but it was... Boring.  Almost everything was fried & needed salt to have any flavor.  They even managed to make Fried Green Tomatoes boring, which was a big disappointment since I LOVE FGT.  Sad.  Entrees eventually arrived.  Mine was the center cut pork chop, billed as juicy & flavorful - two lies right there.  It was a thick cut hockey puck, totally inedible.  The accompanying vegetables were cold, the garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor anywhere, but the whiskey-apples were tasty.  Hubby had the Back Porch trio, baby back ribs, briscuit & chicken.  All of it was dry but the flavor was good on the chicken & ribs.  His sides were baked beans (tasty) and peanut slaw (tasteless).  Our server, Art, offered to remove my entree from the bill so it came to about $50 for the two of us.  The best part?  Hubby saying he never wants to eat there again, because I totally agree.",

My fav. is def the tri tip sandwich and fries, also if you like ranch on your fries there ranch is very good.  Then to end any bbq meal right they give you a hot moist towel to clean the sauce out of your nail beds and between your fingers!

It is in a really cute house like building and is great for big groups of people.   We started off with some really yummy corn bread and apple butter. It was so tasty. I had the sweet tea which was pretty good as well, not artificial tasting and not too sweet. I think I cleared off 3 entire glasses. :)  The servings are soo big that me and my honey share every time. This last trip we got a full rack of baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potatoe fries. Everything was so good and the sweet potatoe fries were really tasty!   This place is not to pricey when you share. Our bill was just over $30 for both of us and we could not even finish our food.

The first time we visited the location at Green Valley, we enjoyed the food and had a great time which caused me to give a five star review. however following terrible experiences at both this and the other Las Vegas location I must give a review that is due. Since the opening of the Lucilles at Red Rock we tried it twice with horrendous results (see my reviews) so we decided to return to this location. The food is still pretty decent but the service and the pricing bites. I am not referring to the pricing on the menu (which I do believe is a bit ridiculous for what you receive) I am referring to the nickel and diming they force you to pay. My favorite example is they make you pay $2.99 for a side salad on a $18.95 meal and then the salad does not have cheese on it. If you ask for cheese they charge you an additional $1.29. They stretch their servers and give them entirely too many tables which makes the service slow at best. We have never experienced the slowness that the Red Rock location has here, but it is still not that much better. If Lucille's wants to gain my business back they need to stop nickel and diming their customers, it would not be as bad if the prices on the menu were not as high as they are, but I cannot imagine why they need to nickel and dime at the prices they have already set. Shame on Lucille's, we won't be back.",

They almost instantly brought out their biscuits with apple butter. These are delicious! I ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer, and the brisket sandwich as my entree. The artichoke dip was good, but the brisket sandwich was amazing! It was cooked to perfection with a sweet barbecue glaze over the top. The meat literally fell apart inside the potato bun. I would definitely recommend this sandwich. I also like the fact that Lucille's puts their drinks in mason jars. And if you are still thirsty after your meal, they offer a soda to go!  Overall, the service was friendly enough to make me feel welcome and the food was undoubtedly delicious. Lucille's deserves this five star rating.

It gets really crowded in the middle of the resturant during peak times.",

Lucille's is always dependable for fun southern drinks and a satisfying meat fest with all kinds of fixin's.    Rolls and apple butter are complimentary.  Start with some fried dill pickles.  Then move on to any kind of BBQ meat imaginable with mac and cheese, collard greens, okra, cole slaw, or baked beans, to name a few.  I particularly like their house original BBQ sauce, although there are a few to choose from.   I've always had decent service and the atmosphere is fun.

But this was the last straw- Seriously waited nearly 45 minutes before we got tired of it and left- we weren't the only ones either- They weren't busy- if they were I'd tolerate the incompetence. I say incompetence because literally we watched a table wait 15 minutes for their waitress to stop walking around looking busy but not accomplishing anything, just to try to get their check- When we left they still hadn't gotten the check- 20 minutes later.  Simply put- managerial skills need to be put in heck and staff need to re-trained.",

The butter was different and tasted amazing. We ordered a spinach and cheese dip and burnt ends for appetizer. The spinach dip was as mediocre as it could get. Came with plenty of chips. The burnt ends were good, some pieces were alittle fatty. But I liked it.   For my meal I had the rack of ribs full order with a side of mash potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Sides were pretty good as were the ribs. Plenty of meat too. You probably don't even need the full rack, the half would have been perfect for me. Sauce on the ribs was just right, not too tangy or sweet. I like the bbq sauces at the table too.  I tried the sausage and the tritips. Both good, sausage alittle spicy. But liked my ribs the best.   We got too full for dessert and had alot of leftovers. Server was nice and friendly. I liked the warm towels at the end. Will definitely come back when I am in Vegas. I'm not much of a BBQ fanatic if that means anything.",

If you want the best BBQ you will not find it here. But, it is super tasty for what it is and we like it very much.  There is only one that I know of in Nevada and it is this one in Henderson. The rest, I think, are around Los Angeles. Lucille's has a large menu and a great children's menu. I actually love the kid's menu and could just steal from our grandson, but I order the pork ribs and he tends to steal those while I eat his penne pasta with butter sauce. It is great, no kidding.  Lucille's has great biscuits and we love their onion rings. All the meats are quite good and you really can't go wrong. The service can be spotty and they need to work on that, but for the most part the service is friendly, and pretty fast.   It can get very crowded and I personally would not wait to eat here, so we stick with showing up early for lunch when we are in town.  Have a great time.",

I really enjoyed the chicken and burnt ends plus the bbq sauce was delicious!! I didn't really like the hot link though. The Mac and cheese was a little dry but it was not terrible and the corn on the cob was pretty good but it did not come with any butter. My daughter had the tri tip and Mac and cheese and she loved her tri tip as well as her root beer she ordered for dessert. My aunt had the same thing as me but she had rib tips and tri tip and greens and Mac and cheese. She also thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry but we both loved the greens ( she let me try hers) ! Also, the biscuits with the apple butter are suuuuuper good!! I should have asked for more.  Oh yeah!! The PEACH LEMONADE .. oh em gee!! it is sooooooo good!!! it comes in a huge mason jar and it was perfect.   over all, I would come here again to try some of the other items on the list.",

I paid $13 for a pulled pork sandwich with one side (fries) and was told that BBQ sauce would be extra. It took 25 minutes from the time I ordered it to the time I received it.   By the time I got home (I live 4 minutes away), the food was cold, meaning it was sitting in the kitchen for a while. Service has to improve, and prices have to come down for me to eat there again.",

My riptip appetizer came out quickly and paired very well with my mango wheat beer I was drinking. I had salmon for my main and it was cooked to perfection. Lucille's is a little pricey but worth it.",

The fried pickles were great too.  Good service, nice place.  Located in a outdoor mall, so be aware the hectic traffic and parking.  I'll definitely go again.",

We got a 2 meat plate-pulled pork and tri-tip, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, onion straws and burnt brisket ends. We got home without any sauces, no big deal since the meat is usually good we didn't mind. Something was off, we didn't finish even half of the meat and barely touched the sides, not normal for us. We threw out the leftovers and went about our night. About an hour after we finished eating, my bf and I were violently ill. Bridesmaids status. I don't know if it was the meat or sides but either way we definitely won't be back. 10/13/18 hopefully no one else got this sick today",

Anyone who knows me know I am not a difficult customer, and I do my best to be nice to anyone who has that job.  I'm gluten free due to an allergy not celiac disease so I don't have be as careful with my food. (I dont need to people to clean off all cookware or anything like that I just can't eat it myself)  We asked for a gluten free menu which I thought was super great that they had them. The server cuts me off to tell me that the biscuits aren't gluten free. (Duh I was just going to bring two and my husband could have both)  They bring out the salads I forgot to ask for no croutons, my fault I take them out and give them to my husband.   We eat our dinner they bring out the wrong sides, we just ask for ours when she gets back. Again we aren't rude about it no fit we just want we ordered.   She wouldn't really make eye contact with us, and was short the place wasn't busy. Sometime people are just shy or task oriented servers. Which I can understand but it felt a bit off.   Dessert my husband asks her if any of the desserts are gluten free. Her response word for word ,\"No, you're just going to have to suck it up and take it home.\"   The food was good but for a place that has so much southern charm, I can't give a good review when a server is that rude unprovoked.  We  won't be returning.",

    "text": "If you want the quick review it is this   Good but Overpriced.   Okay on an update of this review. I have no been there twice. The second time by invite of management, as I was sent a gift card and asked to review again. I love this type of proactive response to review. Unfortunately they fell a little short when sending the gift card out. They send $25.00 gift card. Anyone who has been here can tell you most meals, plus drink and dessert will run you at the minimum of 40 bucks. The 1st time I went my meal and add ons neared 50 and this time when all was said and done I had spent close to 40. So sending a 25 gift card out is almost comical. Since I am going to have to spend more of my own money to try the place again. I give it and A for effort and a C for execution. Now on the the food.   This time I had the two meat plate. Tri-tip and beef ribs. 28.99. My biggest complaint with this place is that is it OVERPRICED. There is another place that I can get all you can eat BBQ in town for 27 bucks after tax, and it is better than this place. But back to the review of the food. The tri-tip was the best I have ever had. It is also the only I have ever had. I look forward to trying more tri-tip in the future. This was some good meat though. The beef ribs they were good. I have had much better else where but they were good. I still really liked the mac and cheese. This time I also tried the banana pudding. I liked it. It was the style I like. Loved the presentation in a mason jar. I will say the over mix was a little off. If it is the mix I am thinking of it had to much of a sour cream taste to it. So I feel the ratio was a bit off of sour cream to cool whip.   Overall this place goes in the good but OVERPRICED category. I would go back but only on someone else's dime.",

So sweet and helpful when it came to us ordering drinks!  We even let her know we would be here a while because of the game.   We ordered the pulled pork queso dip, the fried pickles and the backyard lemon aid.  We loved the dip. It was a bit spicy and didn't expect that. But nothing that the drink couldn't wash down.  The fried pickles wernt our favorite. We thought they were pickle chips. They're pickle spears, which the breading fell off when you took a bite. Oh well.   Overall the customer service was amazing here. The manager even informed us the Warriors game would be on every tv in the bar. I would say I'd come back here again but I don't plan on coming back to Henderson unfortunately. I was just out here for a business event. But I do reccomend coming here!!",

    "text": "Usually we hit this place up for lunch on the weekdays.  They have great lunch deals on their bbq platter combos plus good size servings. Plus it's not too busy and you're seated right away 9 times out of 10.   Nights and weekends are a different story.  Mr. B  wanted to celebrate here with the family, so I made a reservation ahead of time just to be on the safe side.  Luckily I did. You know you might have to have a bit of a wait when you walk up and see there are people sitting & milling around outside of the restaurant.  I let the hostess know we had a reservation and was informed it still would be another 15 minute wait. No problem, we just hung out at the bar and chit chatted with our server there who took my drink order.  Ended up that our table was ready to go 5 minutes later.  We were seated in less than a 10 minute wait.  So if you know you'll be dining on  weekends when they are usually busy, make a reservation.  You dont want to be one of the hot and sweaty guests sitting out on the porch.  Ambiance: This place is smokin! Literally! The smoker is right in plain view of the restaurant and you can smell all the bbq meats being smoked throughout the place.   Noise level: Weekdays: average ..busy weekends/evenings THIS PLACE IS SO LOUD THAT YOU HAVE TO SHOUT TO HEAR YOURSELF!  Either that or I'm really deaf.  That's how noisy it was. I didn't really mind, but I felt sorry for our server who had to repeat herself a lot.  Food: Really 3 STARS ... Its good. Out of all the chain bbq places it's the best out of them. My favorite appys & side dishes are their Creamy Cheese Grits &  Peanut Slaw. Fried Pickles and the onion straws sliced real thin and battered in buttermilk are a must to order!  They come in1/2 and full sizes...1/2 is plenty enough to feed two people.  Oh and their sweet tea refreshing. Love the huge mason jars they always come in.  BBQ platters; Mr B ordered the 2 meat platter and I got the 2 meat platter + 1/2 chicken which was six dollars less.  Both platters had the same amount of portions of meat. At least to me (see photos I snapped).   You do have more choices on the 2 meat platter, but if you're going to order pulled pork and rib tips, the 1/2 chicken 2 meat platter is a great value!  The rib tips tender, brisket, chicken, everything had a nice smoky flavor to it.  I like to top my chicken with more of their original bbq sauce.  It's sweet and not too tangy. I usually buy a bottle also to take home.   Finally dessert: Cake for the birthday guy..a red velvet one. He said it was very good, moist and the icing very sweet and cream cheesy (his words).  I stuck with my usual, warm bread pudding that's drenched in a bourbon sauce . It has bits of peach slices in it. The smaller order is just right for me.   This place is pretty consistent in service.  Wait staff always friendly,(+1 for all the 49er fan props) our food comes out quick, drinks are always refilled on time,  everything is always good, never had been disappointed with any order..and despite the super busy night, Mr. B's birthday celebration here was a success.",

We waited for a good :30-:45 minutes before we were seated. Mind you our whole party was already there. I say that because some places won't seat you unless your whole party has arrived.      Once being seated everything returned to Lucille's normal. Waitresses were bringing us alcoholic drinks, bread (w/ their mouth watering apple butter) water, making sure we were accommodated until we were ready to order. One of the platters we ordered were the beef ribs. I don't know if I was that hungry or what, but I felt like I could just keep eating them and not get full. They were soooo good! I added some of their spicy BBQ sauce to them and it topped it off. I left there very pleased and so was my tummy.",

    "text": "This was my third visit to Lucille's.  The first time my pulled pork sandwich had a big hunk of fat in it, so returned it, so they could remake it.  Waited for it for a long while and finally inquired about it.  Turns out our server thought I said I didn't want another sandwich.  We couldn't figure out how that could possibly have been misunderstood.  Well, by the time I got another sandwich my Mom had finished her meal.  No compensation for the inconvenience either.  The second time I was there with a group of friends, not my choice.  I had the chicken sandwich which was mostly lettuce, soggy onion straws, and an almost non-existent piece of chicken.  Not a good meal for the price.  Third visit was this week, and again, with a group of friends, they like Lucille's.  I had pulled bbq chicken on a baked potato.  The driest baked potato ever, and the chicken was also dry and hardly any sauce on it.  Then I bit into a chicken bone !  I should have said something to the server, and if it had been just me and my husband I would have, but I didn't want to disrupt our group lunch and we were also celebrating a Bday.  That was the last straw for me, and I'll never be back again.  When you start finding bones in your meal, it's just not worth it !",

Love that sugar. The pre-meal biscuits was awesome. The honey butter they give to spread on the biscuit is magical. Their garlic mashed potatoes don't pack as much garlic flavor as I would like, but they were fine. Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw was great, definitely spiced up coleslaw for me. Fried pickles didn't do anything for me, however. Breading fell off way too quick. I ended up just eating a hot pickle. Meh.  Main dishes did not end up as well. The brisket was dry. Very very dry. Definitely needed plenty of BBBQ sauce (the extra B is for BYOBB) to soak into that brisket. It was a shame that it was so dry, I thought the flavor was okay too. Pulled pork was missing flavor. It just ended up more like wet meat than anything. Brisket burger also had dry brisket.    It's a shame that brisket didn't end up being that great, since that's the one BBQ food I do actually enjoy a lot.",

    "text": "In a nutshell, not as good as Famous Dave's but better than Memphis Bbq (I'm only talking about BBQ chains).   I had a gift card so we came here for lunch on saturday. Very crowded. We were seated in the back near a large party celebrating a graduation. And shortly after we were seated, another party sat down; one of the ladies was super loud (it never fails, we always end up next to a loudmouth who announces her business or who sounds like she's with someone who is hard of hearing. I had to tune her out towards the end). Service was very good. It's like we had an army of servers. Our main one was sweating, he was busy.  The sugar topped biscuits and apple butter was my favorite menu item. Deliciousness. Almost like a crisp firm outside and inside it was soft but not doughy. Finished off with apple butter, which melted, mmm.   Big Menu. From the lunch menu, we each had an individual platter, 3 meats, ribs, brisket & chicken, with 1 side item. Hubby chose the garlic mashed while I opted for the potato salad. The meat portions were quite small, the sides more generous. The salad was good, but there was something missing. Maybe it was a bit mild. The bbq flavoring was good (but Famous Dave's is better). The brisket was lean, the chicken was better if you got the breast (hubby did, but he offered the rest of his breast to me, aww). On the ribs, I kept getting some tiny bones (I wasn't eating the bones, I was getting grossed out, sorry, had to use a napkin to discreetly dispose of it). The sauces on the table, only 3- a sweet one, a spicy one, & I forget the last one (FD's has a lot more). I liked the spicy one. Oh, and the peach tea was refreshing. Drinks are in mason jars (like memphis).  Large place, smoker is in the middle of the main dining area, & there is seating outside in the front. Clean restaurant. Nice ambiance compared to the other bbq chains that I mentioned. Cloth napkins. Warm damp washcloths are given after your meal is done. Nice. Servers wear an all-black uniform. Staff is very nice; greetings on the way out.  We did bring a to-go box for the little one. Also had a remaining balance on the gift card (so we are coming back, but ordering other things). And since I signed up for the e-club (ahead of time), I got a $5 off coupon which we used too.",

    "text": "Lucille's opened a few years back at The District near Green Valley Ranch. This is a solid BBQ-type restaurant with excellent food and very good service as well.  If you're at all into BBQ, this is the restaurant for you. The menu is large and diverse, and covers pretty much every end of the spectrum. Whether you want steak, pork, ribs, chicken, or anything in between, they'll more than likely have something up your alley. Additionally, the restaurant often has blues bands playing in its bar area.   The restaurant itself is excellent, however there are some problems. The parking is TERRIBLE. This is a lot shared with much of The District, which right off the bat means that there are going to be minimal places to park. As if this wasn't bad enough, they have blocked off a large portion of the lot for (unneeded!) valet parking. Even worse, an old dirt lot used for overflow parking (which is now needed more than ever!) has been blocked off. Furthermore, wait times can get pretty gruesome during peak hours, even moreso than other restaurants of its kind.  All things considered, though, this is a superb BBQ restaurant if you can deal with the piss-poor parking.  Food: B Service: B- Atmosphere: B-",

I would probably come back here strictly for the bread.  Some people rave about the apple butter, but I think its flavorful with regular butter and just as delish!  2 stars = for the portions.  My boyfriend and I decided to share a 2 meat combo along with 2 sides and an appetizer of sweet potato fries.  It was more than enough.  We had left overs that I was able to bring for lunch the next day at work.    3 stars = for the pulled pork.  HUGE portion, flavorful, and probably so good because it's probably so bad for you.  I had again the next day at lunch, put it in between 2 pieces of wheat bread for a pulled pork sandwich :D  4 stars = for the brisket!  Cooked to perfection, not dry, and juicy, but not raw.  It was flavorful, and even better when slightly dipped in their BBQ sauce.  So good, there were no left overs of this portion but was still enough for the two of us.  5 stars = for the sides.  The beans have sausage in it and has a little spicy kick to it. Yum!  The mac and cheese is ordinary but good, and good portion size too.  The corn!  Yum!  A full ear of corn, buttery, and good!  Overall, I had a great experience here.  Our waitress was attentive, the food was great, and the place has a bar too!  GO NOW! It is so yummy here!",

Tender, juicy ribs with a hint of carmelization on the outside.  Didn't even need to open a bottle of sauce for dipping!  So much food, I couldn't even finish.

Lucille's excels where their competition does not in that it has an excellent outdoor dining area, a live band, good bar scene, and lively ambiance.   Their food is dynamic and overall good, but the one drawback is that it lacks BBQ authenticity and identity. For example, there are three BBQ sauces to choose from: Texas, Memphis, and Spicy House Blend. Don't get me wrong, Lucille's should be on your list of spots to go in Vegas, but expect more of your typical commercialized BBQ chain fare California style than a rustic, authentic spot in Memphis or Texas.",

Technically, this is Henderson, but it's about 10 min east of the airport.    Located in what seems like a fairly new outdoor shopping area, Lucille's is huge and service is absolutely top notch.  The portions looked huge, so come with an appetite.  I ordered a bowl of the gumbo, which had a nice, smoky roux.  The roux is usually the tell-tale sign of a good gumbo, and while it was not down-home, hole in the wall NOLA good, it was unexpectedly great.  I enjoyed it and found the ratio of shrimp, chicken and sausage to be more than adequate.  The gumbo is served over a bed of rice, so it's almost a meal in itself.  For a Yelper, though?  BRING MORE FOOD!  So, with that, I ordered the Tri Tip Plate from the kids menu, which comes with a side of fries and mac & cheese.  I stuck with the meat, which was tender, moist, and nicely smoked.    Great place for two or groups and parking wasn't too bad.",

Rather boring actually.  Fancy smoker does not equal the love that is needed to make good BBQ.  Rolls,- ok,  fried tomatoes - ok, fried pickles - ok, everything needed sauce for flavor.  Waitress was good but the food took forever to arrive and wasn't hot, barely warm upon arrival.  It's a chain restaurant....",

It read \" You are basically a kind a good person\" well thank you.  2. Arrived in Vegas to fly home to Oakland (with the ex, lived there at the time)  3. Agreed on Luclle'e Smokehouse BBQ.  ...this is where it gets fun. My family is from the south, and I think I had the opportunity to taste some of the greatest BBQ in all the land. From Texas to KCMO to Tennessee and down to Mississippi, I know good BBQ. I was wary about good BBQ being in Las Vegas though....  4. Probably the best Bourbon Julep, Tri-Tip sandwich and sides I have ever tasted. I wanted to take a bath in the mac and cheese and tried to smuggle some of the coleslaw home with me, but I ate it before I left the parking lot.  You must visit Lucilles. Read the funny history on the menu. Order a Julep. Walk around and check out the high end shops at \"The District\" when you're done.  You will not be let down by Lucille's.",

I like ribs as much as anyone, however i had never really ventured beyond home made ribs and chilis babyback ribs. So my first time at lucilles, we ordered like a combo plate or some sorts.    the ribs, well i reviewed another lucilles and i have this to say - i could taste the lighter fluid...is that the smoky taste alot of people are referencing?  i did like the mashed sweet potatoes, really its all i ate, bread was good too, and so was my iced tea.  Sorry lucilles, i am not a fan...  highlight was that we saw some actor with his family there that night, dunno his name, an im too distraught over these overpriced ribs to google it, but hes on the show, without a trace, the Caucasian guy...yeah, thats him...  wish i could say NEVER AGAIN to lucilles, but you sadly this is my sister's favorite and she chooses this place when its her turn to choose...bummer",

    "text": "I was craving some BBQ and took my mom here.  The menu looked like it had great potential and our mouths watered from the variety of offerings.  The biscuits were a bit heavy, but were tasty.  We split a two-meat combo. It was massive!!  We ordered the beef and the St. Louis ribs.  Both were on the tough side.  I had to ask the server if it was St. Louis or baby back ribs on the plate - because there was hardly any meat on it!  I was told St. Louis, but I swear they tasted like baby backs!  We also didn't care for the mashed sweet potatoes - it tasted like baby food.  We did order the apple pie and it was generous and tasted good.  Overall, it looks like it's great for gorups, has big food and drink servings, but fell short in taste and authenticity.  If I were to choose to go to a BBQ  restaurant chain, I would go to a Tony Roma's.",

    "text": "From the previously frozen corn on the cob to the mediocre BBQ sauce, this place is the pits. I do like the way they throw all the 1950s furnishings and finishes in there randomly, and our waitress was good, but the food was weak and the people around us were getting horrible service. The table across from us sat there after finishing their meal waiting for the waiter to come back for almost the entire time we were there, and when he asked the host for the tab, he told the guy he should go find his waiter.  Fried green tomatoes were OK, but not great. Sauce was actually pretty good; the highlight of our meal.  The backbone of good BBQ is a good dry rub, and my chicken had none. I'm more of a fan of KC style BBQ, and I don't appreciate when it arrives already slathered in sauce, so I asked for mine dry. That was a mistake, as what came to my table looked like no more than a roasted half chicken. It didn't really taste slow-cooked either, and the meat did not fall apart like it should. Hell, I can cook a beer can chicken in 90 minutes and it falls off the bone. I don't believe they cooked this for half a day as they claimed. Even with any of the three sauces--which couldn't go head to head with Open Pit or KC Masterpiece--left me very disappointed.",

We finally ordered, the food took awhile and there seemed to be an issue with my gift card.  The manager came over, and was super polite and was able to show her how to ring up my order.  This was going to be the first time my husband has eaten Lucille's and he was not impressed at all.  I didn't enjoy my food as much either, but I figured it was because it wasn't piping hot from the oven by the time I got home.  I agree with other reviews that the food is pricey for what you get.  But, their lemonade still rocks and will be ordering that when I am in the area.  I think I will only dine in if I ever eat here again.",

    "text": "The other day I had a craving for a good pulled pork sandwich, which isn't necessarily a good thing considering there aren't many options in town. Luckily I work near Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ which satisfied my craving last time so I headed there for lunch. But while sitting at the bar I decided that I needed to write a burger review this week and I've had the same pulled pork sandwich the last 3 times I've been there, so I caved and did what I always do: ordered a burger. I figured it couldn't be all that bad, I mean, they should know a thing or two about meat right?  Lucille's is located by The District in Henderson along with a whole bunch of other restaurants I haven't ventured into yet and a bunch of typical retail stores. It's actually a chain, with only one location in both Nevada and Arizona, and several locations in California. I'm sure they're all designed and decorated similarly, with jazz-influenced and BBQ related signs, lots of booth seating and a bar. The menu has pretty much everything you would want venturing into a BBQ restaurant. They also happen to have several burger choices on their menu which is lucky for me I guess.  I went with the mushroom burger, which for some reason is missing from their online menu but is included in the full PDF menu you can download. Although I ate one of the two delicious rolls they bring out when you first sit down, I still went with the  1/2 pound burger which was a mistake. This thing is huge. The meat had great flavor and was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I always ask for. The caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms were really flavorful and great, and there was an abundant amount of melted jack cheese to the point that I lost some of it during the course of the meal. The bun was a bit overcooked and dry, but ok until near the end because of how juicy everything was. The whole meal was quite messy like everything else I've eaten here, which is why the warm moistened towel at the end is much appreciated. Overall this was a really good burger, and I couldn't even finish it all because of the size and roll I had eaten before.  My skinny fries were not as good; they had a strong oily flavor like it hadn't been changed in a while, and they didn't seem totally fresh which sucked considering my meal was at the height of the lunch hour. I'm really starting to hate everyone's fries lately I think. It's a constant comment of mine, and really a stupid part of the meal that should be easy to accomplish.  The price is ok I suppose for a restaurant located in a dense shopping area as well as the size of the burger: $12.49 including fries. If the fries were an additional charge I wouldn't be as supportive of this. My meal with an iced tea came to $16.73 total; most could argue that this is still a bit steep for a single burger meal, but given the stipulations I just mentioned I guess I'll let it slide. I did complain about a different meal I had last week because of its $22 price tag, and I will still stand by my stance that that far exceeds the acceptable limit. My burger was more than good, and I will definitely recommend it, but this is a house of good BBQ so stick with the pulled pork sandwich or something if you're reluctant to spend that much on a burger.",

Start with service.  One of the number one reasons I will return to a restaurant.   My server was on it and made sure my muddy water (ice tea with lemonade) was always full.  She was just great.   Food.  I had a lunch platter with baby back ribs, pulled pork, and 1/4 of a chicken.  The flavors where exactly like they should be from a smokehouse.  Absolutely loved the food.  The biscuits were great with apple butter.  The Fried pickles were great.  Breading fell off mostly but still enjoyed them.  The drink.  Muddy water is 1/2 ice tea and 1/2 lemonade.   Could not get enough. I believe I sloshed out of the place from all of the ice tea I drank.  Price was way reasonable and I left a big tip to boot.  I would highly suggest this place for BBQ food in Las Vegas.   Especially since San Jose Smoking Pig was such a disappointment claiming to be a smokehouse.",

I called the manager. They took the plate and came back, apologizing and saying how this has never happened and how their kitchen has double inspections and has won awards . They said that because of the Mother's Day rush, the kale garnish may not have been fully cleaned and they gave us our food free. They asked me if I wanted another plate, to which I replied NO. At that time I couldn't eat anything, let alone food from here. This was the second time I had dined here and I absolutely loved their food. Fast forward to July, I decided to try them again....I asked for NO GARNISH for the entire table....we dined without incident. I also took my daughter there in November . Fast forward to my fiance's birthday. I took him here for lunch. I only ate half of my sandwich and took the rest home for lunch the next day. After work I heated up the remainder of the sandwich, took one bite...chewed....took a second bite and bit into something hard....I pulled it out....it was a small piece of metal...Almost like a piece of paperclip. I quickly packed everything back up and drove to the restaurant. The manager said that they would have a look at everything and call me back. The called me back on Saturday with all the excitement because they REALIZED what the foreign object must be. It was a piece of metal from their fry basket. Yeah ok, I'm glad you figured out what it was...but uh.....So their \"fix\" if you will is to send me a gift card so that I could come back and dine on them for free.....EXCUSE ME? Uh, NOOOOOOOOOOOO. I will not be dining there EVER again.",

I think KFC coleslaw is better. Boyfriend got the corn bread al la carte for 0.99 (pretty good price). I felt the corn bread was a bit dry and it fell apart the moment you put your fork in. The best thing they had were the complimentary biscuits with apple butter (THOSE WERE SO GOOD AND SOFT WE ASKED FOR ANOTHER).   Service: I docked a point with the service. It might not be fair since we did go during July 4th. I will have to come back and give them a second chance. Server was there when we were seated and ready to order and when we were ready for the check. He passed us many times to get other tables' orders but never really stopped to ask us if we needed anything. I waited forever to get a refill of my drink.   Price: It's expensive for what you were getting in my opinion.  Overall: I like it but don't love it. I will go back for happy hour to give them another shot.

    "text": "Lucille's is always delicious. It's our favorite BBQ restaurant. Especially the green valley location. Today we went in for lunch and had SARAH as our server. She wasn't even mediocre..it was terrible!  Please see examples of the horrible service below:  1. One of our sweet teas had BBQ sauce INSIDE of the rim of the glass. Mind you we didn't even order our food yet, so there's absolutely no reason why we would have BBQ sauce in our drinks. When this was brought to SARAH'S attention she said \"oh, that's weird\". Didn't apologize.  2. After our food had been dropped off, she didn't bring any napkins..so we figure we ask her for some when she comes back to check on us. Funny thing is, she NEVER came back to check on us. One of the people from our group had to stand up, walk around the restaurant with BBQ all over his hands to ask another server for napkins.  3. Still no check in from our server. When we were done eating, we had to flag her down to ask for to-go boxes. She brought the boxes and the check without even asking how we enjoyed everything.she even tossed the boxes on top of food that we were going to take to go  4. The fastest service we did receive from her was when she came back for the check. She swiped the card, ran back and dropped the check presenter on the table.  No \"thank you\"'or any type of friendly acknowledgement. I believe she is in dire need of a retraining about what customer service is. She was the WORST server I've experienced in your establishment.",

We don't come here as often as he would like but we try to eat here at least once a month, whether it's dining in or getting takeout.  We like to be seated in the back, away from the bar area where the music can get really loud. There was one time when we were seated right in the first booth and it was fine at first but then the band started playing and we could not hear each other or even enjoy our meal. We had to ask to be moved away from the music and they were happy to obliged.  I always order the Smoke Salmon which is so good and tasty, and I get a side of their Southern Braised Greens which I love! My boyfriend has his favorite which he always gets and that is the Back Porch: Ribs, Chicken, and Tri Tip Platter. And, without fail, his response is always \"Wow, it is so much food!\".  He can finish the whole thing himself without any help from me.  We would like to try their dessert one day but we get so full from the entrees. I guess we'll just have to eat half our meal, take the rest in a doggy bag, and we've made room for dessert!",

We arrived about 5:30 and asked not to be sat near any kids (it is always full of families). Of course they sat us right next to a large party with 3 babies in high chairs.  After waiting a while longer we arrived at a table. The waitress took our drink order and asked if we wanted biscuits which of course we said yes to (the best thing about is place). About 5 minutes later she came by and asked if we wanted biscuits again. We told her she already asked us and we said yes. After our drinks came we ordered the original pulled pork sandwich with bbq beans and the brisket sandwich.   We waited, and waited. No food and no waitress. A Manager happened to walk by and asked if everything was ok. We said we were waiting quite a while for our food and she said she would check on it. Finally our waitress came back and said she ordered the wrong brisket sandwich and it would be out soon. When the food finally arrived my sandwich was bordering cold. The bbq beans were the worst I have ever had. It was more like a soup with a few beans thrown in. The pulled pork was very dry as was the brisket. Both times here the meats have been way over cooked and dry. The Mac and cheese that came with the brisket sandwich was also very plain. A really disappointing experience, again.   When we got the bill nothing was offered to be taken off for the long wait or cold food. Not that we will be going back again, but I might have given 2 stars if they did.",

I'm very picky about how I set things up for my parties and I think he did a better job than I would have done. He was so professional and polite. The food was GREAT and EVERYONE committed on how good it was. We had ribs, chicken, pulled pork, slaw, beans and apple cobbler. It was set up in chafing dishes and came with biscuits and honey butter, lollipops, salad and all the plates, bowls, utensils, napkins and toothpicks! This was our 4th annual Xmas party and by far my favorite food and catering job. Thanks Ethan and Lucille's!!",

My wife and I decided to skip the hour long wait at GVR buffet due to Veterans Day crowd and decided on Lucille's. My wife is from KC, BBQ Heaven, so she and I know the drill. We checked in only to be told 5-10 minutes for which judging by the empty tables in dining room and bar area, didn't make sense. We ended up waiting 25 mins for a table while the staff stood there with empty tables and several that had not been cleared. We were seated in area behind the bar area right next to a party of 20 something and couldn't even hear each other. We sat with our menus for 10 mins with no one even bringing water or asking for a drink order. We looked at each other and got up, walked out.   1. Under staffed? Shame on the manager down the street a casino offering free buffet not anticipating crowd he might get on Tuesday night from their overflow. 2. Poorly trained staff that didn't put butts in seats  3. What I did see of menu had turkey meal, BBQ restaurant or Coco's?  We won't go back to this location.",

To start the staple are the biscuits were way over cooked the top close to being burned.  Mac and cheese was cold and the baby backs were sooooo overdone we couldn't even eat them.  It taste like it was reheated from the night before.  To bad because we used to have great meals but I follow the 3 strikes and your out and this was strike number 3.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my return visit to Lucilles, let me tell why. Our service was done by Art, he was amazing and I was very pleased with him. He checked in us throughout the evening. He made sure to gather anything we needed. Checked on us while servicing other tables. He also offered for us to have to go drinks.  He is exactly the kind of service you'd expect in this line of business, so thank you and if you ever visit this location I recommend him. Of course, my BBQ bacon burger was delicious as always. I would like to report that the biscuits and butter were exactly how I remembered them, so that I was very happy about. Also, the end of the evening cloths were warm and refreshing. The only thing from the last visit to now which could be worked on is the hosts still trying to seat by the door. This time I was lucky it was empty and asked to be moved, with no problem. Otherwise, after returning from my previous visit it was a great evening. Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinions and concerns, and taking the necessary steps to address the issues.   I will return again.",

Unfortunately, my last visit was disappointing. First, they don't serve grits anymore, I hope it's not standard for all locations because it was truly heartbreaking. I love their grits, finding out they no longer serve it literally ruined my visit.  Also, this time around the ribs and chicken were poorly seasoned. They were both too salty and has very little sauce. The service was also very slow. Their service is always slow, but it's tolerable when the food is so good.  I would give it another try just because this is my favorite location and because when they get the flavors right it is amazing. I am still holding on to that, and hoping that my next visit will be a lot better.",

    "text": "My visit to Lucille's BBQ was good enough that I would be willing to come back again but I feel there is some room for improvement. I will preface this review by saying that Lucille's was very busy last night which could account for some of the issues I perceived.  My family and I got to Lucille's after 7:00 PM. It was so crowded it was difficult to even get in the front door and to the counter to put us on the list. I gave them my cell number so we could be notified that ours was the next group to be seated. There is a screened in front porch with some bench seating which we took advantage of while waiting. It did take a while but I do not believe it took even the 25 minutes we were quoted. Maybe 15. We were then taken all the way to the back for dinner.  I already knew before arriving that I wanted a tri tip sandwich and a half order of fried green tomatoes. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side. My step mom ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and my dad ordered a brisket sandwich and a dinner salad.   While we waited for all of that we were brought a basket of biscuits and apple butter. It was all very sweet but good. Then came our sandwiches. No salad. No fried green tomatoes. I asked about them and they were brought a while later. My dad was going to turn down the salad since it should have come before the meal but he took and ate it anyway. As did I with the fried green tomatoes.  As far as taste, quality and freshness go, the potatoes were good. Lumpy fresh potatoes complete with skins. The tri tip in my sandwich had good flavor but was dry. It needed a healthy dowsing of BBQ sauce. Original I believe. The tomatoes were good. Fried perfectly crisp. A bit of a sour note from being green. It was the sauce I did not care for. I don't know what it is but it reminded me of Burger King's onion ring sauce. I could have done without a plate full of it. Maybe a side of ranch dressing instead.  I love the smells here. And the rustic theming of the various kitch filled dining rooms is cool. Service is friendly though maybe a bit spotty in certain aspects. Food was not disappointing but could have been better.  But again, it was good enough that I would gladly go back again.  UPDATE - Somebody from Lucille's has reached out to me about the issues I have addressed above. They wish to make things right. It is unecessary and, as mentioned above, I do intend to return at a later date. With a future experience to come, my hope is that the improvements I seek are made and I can update my review to a higher score. In the mean time, I should clarify that the server, I believe, removed my dad's salad from the bill as an apology for it being brought after the sandwiches. That along with the PM from the restaurant's management team go a long way in strengthening their customer service score. It is worthy of a half-star bump up to a 3.5 rating which I cannot make known in the actual star rating. Hopefully you are all reading this far to know so.",

I was early which was fine by me to wait, the woman checking me out was very sweet. It was our first time dining there so she went through the whole order and provided one of each of the sauces to see which I liked so I knew for the next visit.  The food was so good, I will be back for the fried green tomatoes and the fried pickle spears alone. The biscuits and apple butter also AMAZING. Being a vegetarian and eating at a BBQ place is not ideal but I am happy to report the food I had did not taste like meat and it was good good good..",

However, I wanted to point out the recent incident that occurred for our last event which is why I am unable to give this review 5 full stars.   With the amounts of engagement parties, baptism receptions, and birthdays we've celebrated here we have never encountered this incident. Prior to my event on 02/26, I called the restaurant to assure that my reservation was 1. not only in place, but 2. to see what time we were able to come in for set up. The attendant on the phone gladly told me that I was more than welcome to come in at 5:30 to set up my decorations, as the room should already begin it's set up. The lady also said she would write a note on our reservation details to let the staff know I was coming.   When I had walked in at 6:30 on 02/27 (date of event) I noticed that there were people seated in the private room area we normally booked. I was confused, so i went to the hostess, Kaycee. She has told me that i was not able to enter the room until my reservation at 7pm, and that we would not be seated until at LEAST half of the party arrived. This was a major shocker since I called ahead of time, and I still came an hour later than the agreed set up time. I immediately asked for the manager, who may I say handled the situation great. But as we were waiting for him to come, three of the staff members behind the counter, Kaycee, Francis, and Tyler were stating negative remarks talking about my family and I who were STILL standing in front of their counter listening.   That to me was not quality service as it is never okay to talk about a customer in front of their faces. In ANY business. This behavior is NOT acceptable.   Thankfully the staff that handled our event were so friendly, the servers and the manager who continually checked up on us. They are the reasons why we will still continue to return. However, hopefully upon our next visit this issue will have clearly been resolved and we will not have to encounter such inappropriate behavior.",

What I love about this place is you can get all your classics here- brisket, burnt ends, chicken, ribs, etc, and the flavor is just so good! They also start you off with some bread w apple butter. Don't skip out on that. Prices are pretty reasonable, and the serving size is really good! Good place for groups.",

And the first time at the bar so maybe we'll skip out on that next time. Don't get me wrong, the food is good -- mac and cheese (cheesy and flavorful), brisket is tender, gumbo is rich (kind of salty), biscuits and butter are to die for, but the service this time just really blew it for us.

    "text": "2 words come to mind every time I think about this place. Grilled Artichoke! Dear God, I never knew a vegetable could taste so good. This is not the steamed, flavorless, drenched in mayo, artichoke that your mother may or may not  have tortured you with as a child, even if you thought you liked it at the  time.. This is the king of all artichokes, Artichoke superhero.  Saving the world one delightful leaf at a time ;) I live on the complete other side of the valley from this place and while they do have some good barbecue, great tea, and awesome biscuits, somehow my wife and I find ourselves making the 45 minute drive (light traffic) to get a vegetable. As a meatatarian you can imagine my horror/chagrin/embarrassment at the situation.. somehow reminding myself that I am going to a barbecue joint doesnt ease the odd feeling.. I KNOW why I am going there and it ain't the ribs. (sorry Lucille)  They do serve it with a dipping sauce but the buttery and smokey flavor really just  set it off right ..  I cant remember if I even eat the dipping sauce. I can just picture licking the smokey flavor off my fingers afterwards..  My wife absolutely WILL NOT share this appetizer with me and we have to each order  our own. As a Chef I've tried many times to duplicate this recipe in my own  kitchen and while I have come close, it's never quite the same.. So after many, many tries I've resigned myself to the fact that we will be forced to drive  across town for the best damn Artichoke I've ever had.",

The next time in we couldn't get anyone over to the table for anything. The last time we made reservations we had to wait 45 minutes after the reservation time. Not acceptable. Didn't go back for several months. (that was also the visit where we couldn't get a server to do anything for us.) While comparably priced with other BBQ restaurants around town, for the money I expect better, more consistent service. When it is good it is great, unfortunately we have had too many unfortunate experiences. For lunch you can't go wrong with one of their sandwiches, pulled pork, ti-tip or brisket all tasty. For supper go with a combo platter. You get to sample a little of everything and have lunch the next day. Favorites would be the baby back ribs, tri-tip, garlic mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. The biscuits and cinnamon butter are a great compliment to your meal. They are located in the District at GVR. At times parking is a bit sparse but we have always found something. One nice thing is that after your meal you can wander around the store and shops at the District and work off some of your meal. Summary - they are close to the house and the food is good, service is hit or miss.",

I took a while to get someplace to sit but once we did they were able to put us all together in one table and that in itself was good accommodations.  We ordered the Super Feast.  The Feast or the Super Feast is the way to go to avoid little nuances of choosiness and makes it more of a family style meal.  The foodserver was top notch and although they included 18% since I had a large party, we added a little more to make sure he received 20%.    We have also used Lucille's for catering parties.  They have this service down pat and when you need to feed a lot of folks with food that makes them lick their fingers, this is where you want to call.",

After reading Yelp!, I noticed the classification for this restaurant was \"Creole/Cajun.\"  \"Wait, WHAT\", I remarked to myself, and at that point was duly interested.  I didn't eat a big meal, but I ate well.  I tried their fried pickles, and those are excellent, with the ranch and creole mustard.  My main dish was the gumbo, and holy cow.  That was proper, full, \"bonafide\" delicious.  The roux was properly smoky, and full of andouille, chicken and shrimp.  I actually saved a little to take home so I could have some for later.  Service was excellent.  Our server (Abby), was friendly, accommodating, and funny.  She was on top of everything, despite the room being so crowded, and was as nice as could be.  The also had a live band playing some Southern blues music, and it fit the atmosphere of the place well.  The downside?  It's on the complete opposite side of town for me (story of my life), and I'm not a big fan of the epic drive that it takes to get from one side of Vegas to the other.  That said, I'll suck it up, and come back out this way for this place.  I was impressed.  I haven't found a decent Cajun place out in Vegas until this, and the first experiment was a winner.  I left full and happy, with a tiny portion of gumbo in tow, and left wondering how good will the other meals be.",

Even though it's a chain restaurant it has that \"hole in the wall\" feeling.    Although we did have to wait a bit even though it wasn't that busy, the experience was a good one.  They started us off with Biscuits and this cinnamon honey butter stuff that was delicious!  We ordered the fried green tomato's  which were excellent.  They were breaded and fried to perfection while the inside still had a bite to it!  Then we did the two meat meal; we chose the BBQ tri tip and beef brisket, partnered with the honey peanut slaw and sweet potatoe fries.  I gotta say, I don't know if it was what we picked or if it's just that good but it was some of the best BBQ and sides that I have had in a while.  The Tri tip melted in your mouth and the beef brisket had just a touch of chewiness to it that held up to the sauces and was quite nice on it's own.  Overall a great experience that I will go back for, just make sure to bring your appetite!!!",

I waited a while after finally placing my order and my drug rep went to go pick up our order that we had ready for 1:30 pm, only to find out our order was never placed. And what makes it worse is that her name is Deb AND SHE IS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LUCILLE'S BBQ!!!  When i called regarding it, she had NO IDEA what i was talking about. She told me that she takes the to go orders over the phone but does not remember taking mine.  that disgusts me that the GM cant place a to go order correctly. like i said i work for a doctors office. and we only have a certain amount of time and eat our lunch and have multiple different people pick up our to go order and bring it to our office. This enrages us because now we have nothing to eat for lunch. We will NEVER  be using this place again and will not recommend it either. If you ask me, Lucille's clearly needs a new General Manager",

I've tried the ribs. brisket. and pulled pork before and i don't care too much for it... a little dry.  the sides are all relish! mac and cheese...classic and creamy. collars greens...my fave!! cooked well and has a lot of smoke from the ham hock. corn on the cob...mmm a whole cob of corn. sweet potato mash was more like dessert than anything... very good but very very sweet.

I have not enjoyed any other BBQ in town (Memphis is nasty) and if I will say okay to this place once in a while, now you will know why!  *Outdoor patio seating: this past Friday we sat outside, in perfect weather, while the Dave Matthews cover band played over yonder. *Mason jars: we are thirsty people.  Most restaurants won't leave water pitchers on your table, but Lucille's mason jar water glasses are big enough where pitchers are not necessary. *Biscuits: I never really was a biscuit person growing up, but I sure like these sugary babies, and their refills. *Enormous portions: Eric R. and I came here prior to a day-long fast for a holiday.  We needed to BE FULL, and we sure were when we left.  Food coma-esque. *Fairness: We ordered the new dinner for 2.  It came with a half appetizer, half chicken, 2 different sets of 4 pork ribs, and a choice of additional meat, plus 2 sides, plus dessert (yes, it sounds like death).  Well, most people know I do not eat pork.  The waiter checked and said we could sub 1 beef rib for every 2 pork ribs.  That was generous, as one beef rib is bigger than at least 3 pork ribs.  It was a messy, gnawing, lipsmacking good time and required multiple warm wet towels. *Warning: I am not a big dessert person.  Eric R. magically guessed of the options that I would want the peach pecan bread pudding in bourbon vanilla sauce.  We could not eat more than half of it between the 2 of us.  It was so sweet I am on the road to diabetes already....but it was really, really good. *Warning #2: Last time I ordered a mint julep and I believe there was only bourbon and no simple syrup.  That may be a good thing to some people.",

I had the fried chicken sandwich (add avocado) and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was buttermilk fried chicken and the mashed potatoes were garlicky and tasty.  My husband had the short ribs and they were  melt in your mouth fall off the bone fantastic.  He had the peanut slaw and vegetable medley for sides and both were also very good.  The prices were more than I would normally pay for BBQ but I chalk that up to it being Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is a gamble.  One place is cheap and delish, the next is expensive and meh, but this one was darn good.  Our server was attentive and quick without being pushy.  The faux Texan accent he affected was unnecessary as we weren't looking for \"authentic\" in Vegas.  I mean, nothing about that city is authentic.",

To get it out in the open, if you're looking for cheap barbecue this is not the place for you to come. While I wouldn't call Lucille's overpriced, it definitely isn't cheap.      I am a big fan of their baby back ribs and their fried catfish.  There isn't much on the menu here that isn't good. Some of their menu items are good, though, but not great. They're good because they are tasty and delicious, but I wouldn't classify some of them as great because to me they lack that authentic homestyle Southern flare. It's good and Southern, just not good and southern like granny used to make.   What keeps them from being 4 stars? Their pricing. I think their prices could be a little lower. But their prices are not unfair. Also, their lack of hushpuppies is disturbing. When I go in for Southern food, I want some hushpuppies!!!   The customer service here is usually great; have not had a bad experience yet. Do expect a wait sometimes to be seated.   Would I come back here? I'm sure I will be back again.

We had to send out ribs back because they were gorged in salt and not edible .  The 2nd rack was still over salted but not quite as bad.. Partially edible, Some pieces of rib were nasty salty and some were tolerable.. But we were so hungry so we forced it down and didn't want to complain again cause it's embarrassing.  I'm worried that it's gonna get saltier and saltier every time. This will probably sadly be the last time we come here.  I used to rave about the quality of this place but it's sadly not the same.  If I was to offer advice id say don't salt the items so much. People can always add more salt to their liking.",

They gave by brother a little cake and a Birthday Card which I though was cool.  As far a BBQ goes.. It wouldn't be on the top of my list as bbq places to go to.  $260 for 6 people.  $28 for a full rack of tough ribs.

Now I must say if you want a delicious biscuit with apple butter go there. But if you are looking for a rib dinner that does not take your splurge money for the week stay away. The ribs and the dinner I had was baby back full rack,sweet potato fries (cold) and creamy cold slaw (dry). Two dinners almost the same left me $68 dollars short and still hungry, Wait staff all nice and friendly but I went to eat and paying that kind of money I did not expect to go home to raid the fridge. So with the three stars it sll goes to the biscuits and our waiter Austin! Lower the price give a little more and I may go back... Just saying folks be ready to shed the $!",

    "text": "We've been coming to Lucille's for years.  We've been so frequently that I realized I have never done a yelp review on the place.  I thought I had already.  So, since I went to the Red Rock location recently and didn't have a great experience, I think it's only fair to sing the praises of the location at the District.  This is a large restaurant, and easily seats large groups.  When family comes into town, we usually have a meal at Lucille's. It's kid friendly as well, in both the menu as well as the restaurant set up.  So, no problems there.  I usually get the sweet tea or strawberry lemonade.  Both are winners, and come in huge mason jars.  Even with a lot of ice (which is how I order my drinks) you get plenty of your beverage.   To start, we typically get fried pickles, fried okra, or onion straws.  Okra is a dish that not a lot of places in Vegas offer.  I wish they offered it as a side and not just an appetizer.  The appetizers are a good value, as they are large enough to feed many (particularly the onion straws).  To eat, I usually get some form of BBQ, or the mardi gras chicken.  This is probably my favorite dish at Lucille's, it's 2 large chicken breasts which have been breaded and fried.  It comes with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a great shrimp cream sauce with peppers.  I always have leftovers, and it reheats well.  This is a unique dish worth giving a shot.  I also get the fried chicken sandwich and usually take half of that home.  This is a large menu, but they get it right.  We usually leave happy, and usually with leftovers.  Even though there may be a wait, the place is so large it's usually not that long.  If the weather permits (it's not over 100 degrees outside) I recommend the patio.",

Proportions: HUGE, YOU WILL HAVE LEFT OVERS  price: I got a two meat combo for 28 dollars but it came with HUGE beef ribs (three bones) and five pieces of tri tip, along with two sides. Also got an additional cup of clam chowder for 2.50 but that was also amazing.  Service: had Art who was just amazing in every way. He will get you anything you want or need.  Waiting time: took a long time although we came it at 630 pm on a Friday night so that was probably why it took like 35-40 minutes but IT'S WORTH IT.  atmosphere: really loud because of the live jazz music so hard to chat with everyone at the table but it was fun music and even was greatly set up so it didn't feel crowded or anything.   QUALITY: this food is amazing especially the beef ribs, they are huge and tender and delicious and you get their homemade bbq sauce selection and the best one was the smokey sauce.   Overall I will not only be coming back ALOT but this has become at least my second favorite restaurant and will be bringing everyone I know and recommending it to any tourist who asks. YOU NEED TO EAT HERE",

Appreciated the timeliness of them taking action and won't let this negative experience at the Vegas location outweigh my positive experience at the Culver City location especially after management made an effort to make me feel like a valued guest and welcoming of my feedback.  Got super excited when I saw there was a Lucille's in Vegas after visiting the one in Culver City, CA (went twice in three days it was soooo good). We don't have Lucille's in Seattle so I couldn't wait to eat here.  I ordered through Uber Eats and has my food delivered-- arrived within 45 minutes which was great. However, my order was beyond incorrect. And highly disappointing for $45. I ordered the smothered chicken which says it comes with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables-- I ended up with coleslaw and cold French fries. Now if that wasn't bad enough... there was NO gravy for the chicken. So my chicken was \"smotherless\". Lucky there was a bbq sauce in the bag to go along with the bbq chicken sandwich I ordered my friend.   All in all, not a good experience and I don't know if I'd come here agai",

There are tables or high top booth tables by the bar, and my favorite \"the back porch\"... and that's just what it feels like. Lucille's is tucked on the back of The District in Green Valley Ranch in Henderson. It's one of my favorites. Tonight I ordered the pan seared catfish and it was by far the best catfish I've ever had. The garlic mashed potatoes that were light, and fluffy clearing my palette for that amazing catfish. It was a beautiful large portion of perfectly seasoned fish, laying on a thin layer of a creole mustard sauce. It is also served with a generous portion of  their braised greens;truly mind blowing. Nice big chunks of pork accenting the flavor the greens. It was truly delightful. Even the caesar salad was exactly as you would hope it would taste like when you order it... (Thank you Jessica.... our gorgeous waitress/server... who recommended it to me. Kudos... It was delicious... The hot rolls with make you wanna lick outta of the bowl apple butter, are in the top 10 of comfort foods.. Kinda makes me wanna be sad.. so I can say it's okay to eat a dozen. My bf ordered the brisket with a double order of cornbread... Oh my joodness... it comes with this clever little stainless steel mini pitcher that was filled with this magic juice that once poured over the brisket, tempted you to get primal and just start tearing at it with your teeth and claws... The cornbread was at least 4x4' of goodness that kept its structure and texture while sitting in the sauce I just described, for at least 3 hours. It was actually impressive. I'm pretty serious about anti-soggy anything. This corn bread was a gorgeous piece of gold. My favorite part of all dinner is my bloody mary with tanqueray. Their's is probably a personal preferance for someone. I thought it was joke when I asked for more mix to cut down the worshestire... but i believe they use their bbq sauce in it.. It tasted like steak sauce to me and i couldn't drink it., but you might like it. We sat inside and had the most pleasant time because of our waitress Jessica. She was always quick and knowledgable about anything we wanted to know about. She was very efficient with the way she serves and clears a table. She kept delightful eye contact and had a room brightening smile. She made me wanna hang out and chill.  We were lucky enough to have a quick encounter with our server Kim who happen to be sisters with our lovely waitress Jessica. Both were beautifully put together with bright eyes and a certain charm that made you wanna come back to their house. I love Lucille's and I think that you would be shaming yourself to not visit this location. There is also one on the other side of Vegas at Red Rock but I've always gone back to this one... feels like home.",

I've ordered various dishes but I do like their bbq chicken, very moist and tender. If you like fried pickles, they do a great version.   One thing I like about this place is 4th of July. Make a reservation ahead of time. Then after your fill, walk across the street to Green Valley casino to watch the fireworks. It's not 'Murica unless you have fireworks with your bbq!",

The turkey and ham were very smoky tasting to the point of being cloying. We had tons of food left so we brought it home. Next day I heated it up and that smoking flavor was so strong it was nauseating. My thoughts ran to whether the meat was actually smoked or Liquid smoke was used.  I've never eaten thanksgiving dinner out before and probably won't again. :-(",

    "text": "I attended a private party here recently on a Thursday night, and 40 of us had the side room adjacent to the bar all to ourselves.  Our hosts ordered several of the Lucille's Super Feasts, so we were able to try almost everything they offer.  Beef ribs: by far my favorite dish.  They were huge and meaty, but very tender & flavorful.  Don't be dainty and folk-and-knife these suckers.  Just go all Fred Flintstone on them and eat them like giants turkey legs!  Baby back ribs:  a close 2nd to the beef ribs, also very flavorful.  Could have easily polished off a rack of these suckers.  Sausage:  I'm not normally a fan of hot links, but these were pretty good.  They had a good amount of kick to them, but not too spicy to need too much water or milk.  The casings had a good snap, too.  Tri-tip:  probably the most disappointing part of the meal.  The meat was a little dry and probably overcooked.  Needed BBQ sauce to get them down.  When I come back for a regular meal, I will stick to the beef ribs (since most BBQ joints don't offer them) and feel like I'm a caveman. ' Also, the staff were very accommodating to this crazy group.  And the bartender gave us very generous pours of our drinks!",

Even when it's mediocre (in my demanding opinion) it's pretty damn good.   Just a warning to the barbecue layman: there is bones in the barbecue as is the custom in many barbecue traditions. They are usually edible (not the rib bones obviously) but this is BBQ tradition and not Lucille's laziness. Lucille's is not lazy.  Protip: The burgers might actually be better than the barbecue. THEYRE AMAZING. 2nd Protip: The Garlic Mashed Potatoes are cooked by angels and then flown down from heaven. That's the only explanation for them.",

The portions are huge, and the waitstaff - or at least our server, Teresa - is endlessly accomodating. I would have liked their sweet tea to be a little colder but I'm from NorCal, I like just about everything cold - it was delicious nonetheless! For our appetizers we had the onion straws (pretty standard fare but the honey mustard dipping sauce was amazing) and the fried green tomatoes (excellent).  Jambalaya was super spicy, loved it - and I had a beef brisket sandwich, which was a little dry but a couple of squirts of their Original BBQ Sauce solved everything. I had my choice of two sides, and I chose the peanut coleslaw and fries - they gave me a shitload of fries. If I weren't already so full from the appetizers I probably would have eaten them all - they were great.  The next time I come here, I'd like to try the desserts.   I loved the bathrooms - the doors were designated as follows: \"Womens\", \"Mens\", and \"All Y'all\" (family rooms / baby changing tables). Too funny!  Overall, a great place to take family for a laid back good time. Come here on an empty stomach if possible, I'm sure I wouldn't have needed a box if I came here during lunch.",

The last time we visited this Lucille's location, it was an early afternoon and we were seated quickly. Our waitress, Typhanie, was very attentive. I had completely forgotten about those soft, pillowy little pieces of heaven called biscuits with apple butter. She apologized for the biscuits being so late to arrive to our table. I hadn't noticed, as I was still deciding what I wanted to eat. It's a hard decision there when everything is good!  I decided on the pulled sliders-two pork and one chicken. Ate those up quickly while sipping my half sweet/half non sweet tea in my favorite-MASON JARS! Totally gives that southern feel to the place.  Typhanie once again comes to our table and apologizes for the delay in the arrival of my husband's beer. Once again I am clueless as I am now browsing the dessert menu. Typhanie offers a free dessert for the lack of service, but we are so full and oblivious to the supposed lack of service that we politely decline.  It's been a long time since we've had a waitress THIS good, to accompany food THIS good.  Bravo, you little southern feel, southern cali restaurant chain! You hire great employees, and serve up some good cookin!",

YUM. i would like to have more right now as im writing this review. it came with 2 different sauces (ranch and a dijon mustard) but i prefered the ranch sauce. yum. we also ordered the cornbread which was just the right consistancy. it didnt fall apart when you cut into it with your fork. the fried green tomatoes were also delicious and it came with some red pepper sauce. yum. i cant stop saying that.   for the main course i had the bbq tri tip sandwich with extra crispy sweet potato fries. holy moly, the meat in this sandwich was SO soft, i couldnt get enough. probably one of the best sandwiches ive ever eaten. and im really not big on the bbq. but dang, the flavors in this sandwich were unreal. and the fries!? they were actually extra crispy! thank God because i hate soft fries! my husband had the jambalaya which he loved.   dessert....we HAD to have dessert. even tho we were so full from all the other food we had just eaten. we had the banana pudding which came with lots of nilla wafers and bananas inside. we didnt think we would be able to finish the entire thing because like i said, we were full. BUT the dessert was SO good. we ate it all. and became stuffed. so stuffed i had to do a couple laps around the shopping area after we were done eating.  bring an empty stomach. because youre gonna need it with all the things youre gonna wanna try here. and save room for dessert. definitely coming back here again.",

    "text": "The ONLY reason I give this place four stars instead of five is because the service was lacking a bit. It took forever for us to get drinks/extra napkins/ketchup.   Other than that, the food was outstanding. We came here on Memorial Day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some ribs, we just had to have them!  We got the fire roasted artichoke for the table. My only complaint is that the artichoke was not very meaty and if I'm paying $10 for an artichoke, it shouldn't be small with leaves that hardly have anything to grab at. The garlic/mayo dipping sauce was delicious!   My gf and I shared the Lucille's platter - it came w/ two chicken breasts, four ribs, a few slices of tri-tip meat and two sides. We opted for corn and french fries. Every single bite of this meal was delicious. The rib meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and the chicken was impressive too (usually chicken is just blah for me). The tri-tip was absolutely phenomenal. We ate the entire platter and brought one huge chicken breast home, so these serving sizes do not mess around! The corn was also really really good. It was obvious that it was fresh and grilled and there was some type of pepper butter on it that was extremely flavorful.   All in all, I will definitely be back the next time I'm craving some southern BBQ.  Be weary, the prices are a little high compared to other BBQ joints around time, but I do think the quality of food and the preparation is worth it!",

Located at the district which is still a great little higher end place to shop but without the crazy busy strip location.  The locals eat here though and it is often very busy on weekend so call ahead.  It's the best bbq joint in town.  Be prepared to not eat for the next couple days though because the portions are huge!!! We always get their hand made bbq chips for an appetizer.  Combine that with the amazing complimentary rolls and I'm already pushing my limits.  If I go for lunch I will get one of their sandwiches (usually tri tip) but for dinner you gotta get one of their smoked meats.  I would recommend their baby back ribs that are literally fall of the bone tender! But why stop there, you are already full so add the pulled pork or chicken too haha we use to order a kids meal for my daughter but now we just get a side of their Mac and cheese which is way better than the kids meal Mac and cheese because it for adults (at least that what we tell her)",

I always order a full rack of baby back ribs and take the rest home. The leftovers make for a great treat later or the next day. This time I ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and shoestring fries. Everything was delicious.  Lucille's also serves the best strawberry lemonade, which comes in an old school jar! The backporch strawberry lemonade is also really good (strawberry lemonade with vodka).  It was my friend's birthday so they have him a little sundae with a candle, which was kind of neat. Only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because service could have been better. Our waiter didn't seem too happy, or maybe he was just busy. Not bad service, but not great either.  We will be back.",

The biscuits they brought out were cold and too sweet.  I ordered the half chicken and memphis style ribs.  The chicken was not bad however the spare ribs were dry.  I had to use the cold BBQ sauce on the table to make them edible.  I got the French fries and coleslaw as my sides.  The cole slaw was typical.  The fries tasted like dirty oil.  The waitress was in a coma was rushing us to order and after the food finally came she was nowhere to be found.  Will never go back to this place again.  Total ripoff.  Could have eaten in much more elegant place with better food taste and quality.",

No need for an appetizer or dessert. The biscuits and apple butter act as both. To be totally honest, what you want is on the dinner plate. Only wish I had tried more choices.

When we arrived, the wait time was 45 minutes to an hour, we counted at least 10 dirty empty tables from where we were standing while one young person at the check in desk was drawing/doodling some kind of design on a notepad. I'm guessing that he was not allowed to be part of the team, while other hosts were cleaning, seating and helping other team members.  We've been patronizing lucilles since it opened, but I'm afraid that we will not be able to afford to continue to patronize this restaurant. P. S. The waitress was very attentive and professional.",

We had a full rack of baby back ribs that I do think could have been alittle more tender, but still had a really good flavor. The pulled pork was yummy it was moist and very little fat. The burnt brisket ends had alittle more fat on them then I'd usually prefer but they also were tasty! For sides we got the Mac and cheese, corn on the cob, garlic mashed, and sweet potato fries and I'd highly recommend them all! With my meal I had a cucumber vodka drink that was amazing! So refreshing and I'm not even a huge fan of cucumber but it was made really well. I look forward to coming back here and trying some other things.",

A few of my coworkers and I went to Lucille's for lunch. And here's the review:  The Good:  I had a BBQ salad and the meat, though there was not much on the plate, was flavorful and tender. I got to try some of my friend's brisket, and it too was juicy anf flavored nicely. I love that all of their drinks come in mason jars, and their menu offers a variety of BBQ items to choose from. In addition, they have an in-house smoker so the aroma of BBQ hits you right when you walk through the door.  The Bad: The service is friendly enough, but sometime it felt like we were being rushed.  For lunch on a Wednesday, it was quite crowded, and we had to request refills on our drinks. In addition, their prices are a bit high for the amount of food you actually get. I've been to several BBQ places, and Lucille's seems to focus on being a bit more upscale than their competitors.   Will I return? Probably. But, this is not my first choice in BBQ.",

My only complaint is that they didn't have any safe desserts, but I would still come back here for sure.

Snazzy.  I grew up in Oklahoma so I love the vibe I get from this restaurant. I honestly feel like I'm in a grandparent's home rather than a commercial restaurant. When I lived out there, I thought that people who served drinks in Mason jars were hicks and snubbed my nose when offered a drink out of them, but here, it feels a little quaint and I enjoy it. Funny how being a self-righteous snob works :-S I should work on that.   Whoever came up with the design of this place has skills on lock. It's genius that there are coat racks at every booth so you don't have to mess with your purse or coat on the back of your chair. In the ladies' bathroom, there's purse hangers near every sink - I've never seen that before but it's awesome.   On to the food. I'm not a biscuit person; I never have been. I've been told by tons of people that my mom is the queen of biscuit making but alas, I almost never eat any. I can't resist trying half a biscuit at Lucille's with their apple-butter.   The meats here are delicious but their salads are just so-so. A small salad is way huge - larger than a Chili's salad. I can't imagine how large a \"regular\" salad would be.   The service is fast and awesome and I love that they give you hot, and I mean HOT, wet towels to clean your hands after your meal, along with complimentary blow pops at the front of the house (lots of blues and reds - the best flavors!)",

I got the bbq two meat combo I got the baby back ribs and the spicy hot links and as my sides i got the baked beans and the mac n cheese. The ribs were falling off the bone and the bbq sauce was delicious so sweet and flavorful, the hot links were nice and spicy. As far as the sides the mac n cheese was creamy cheesy goodness and the baked beans were sweet and had a lil kick also very good. Oh and it comes with a slice of watermelon which just happend to be the sweetest juiciest watermelon ive ever had. I also grabbed a few bites of my bf's mashed potatoes and omg they were sooo creamy and delicious. To wash this mouth water meal down I had sweet tea with my meal which was just as delicious as the meal.   I was oooing and awwwing the entire meal I went there expecting a great meal and thats exactly what i got. They have good quality food, huge portions, and good service.  Its a lil pricey for bbq about $80 with tip but it was well worth it!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group last Saturday night. Parking was pretty ridiculous since the District is apparently a very popular destination. We started our meal with biscuits and apple butter, which were pretty yummy, as well as a salad with croutons and choice of four dressing (ranch, bleu cheese, balsamic, italian). Then they brought out an assortment of all kinds of meat, including pork ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. We also had a nice variety of sides, including french fries, sweet potato fries, mashed potatoes (surprisingly awesome), collard greens (not bad), and veggies.  I enjoyed mostly everything and was pleasantly surprised at how moist the chicken was. The sweet potato fries were not that impressive, although the normal ones were. I honestly could have done without the loud music, which makes it hard for anyone inside the building to have a conversation, and I found that the Memphis-style BBQ sauce was too tangy and almost seemed to have a metallic flavor. However, I really loved the normal BBQ sauce (and I avoided the other one because I'm not that much of a fan of spicy).  Lucille's is not perfect, but it's a really nice place on this side of town to enjoy American BBQ.",

That being said I've gone here twice and I would come back again.  The price point is a little higher than Famous Dave's and I'm not sure I can taste a huge difference (take that with a grain of salt, I've only had two menu items!).  Portions are large and a normal shorter than 6' 5\" person will fill up quickly.  Drinks are served in large caning jars and there are PLENTY of sides to choose from with your dinner.  I personally had the brisket which was very tasty, although I had two pieces which were layered in a decent amount of fat that were not consumable.  The sweet rolls they bring to the table with cinnamon butter are a tasty warm-up for the main course.  I would be interested in trying more things here, but i doubt I'll make a special trip, in fact we were originally going to Top Notch BBQ but they were closed for the evening.",

Never had to go out to a restaurant  for this goodness but now that I live in Vegas with it only being my boy friend and I, it would be wayy too much to cook for just two people. So my manager told me about this place. She said she will have Lucille's catered to our Christmas party so my boy friend and I decided to give it a shot before then.   We service was nice. Very friendly but a too perky. That didn't make me feel the southern hospitality I was looking for. It made me feel more like I was in a Laguna Beach Cafe. But, I must say the waitress was very helpful when it came to menu knowledge being that it was our first time at Lucille's. We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides and a side of hot link. For the two sides we chose french fries and baked beans. I liked the spicy flavor in the bakes beans, although I didn't like that they were a little hard or under cooked. The ribs were very tasty and fell off the bone. The hot link was amazing. Reminded me of the hot links that are sold in my old hometown market Oakwood. I also liked the coat hanger at each booth.   We arrived at approx 8:30PM to the restaurant and was sat immediately due to no wait. By time we ordered it was about 8:55. Then I noticed happy hour started at 9PM. There was a couple things my boyfriend and I wanted to try on the happy hour menu and the hostess was going over some of her favorites as well. She said we just had to wait 5 mins and could order from that menu. So I say okay cool. Then she comes back and says, I am sorry but happy hour is only in the bar, if you would like to order from that menu, you would have to move and sit in the bar area. I looked around, we were comfy in our booth, had our coats hanging, drinks ordered, and our waitress was coming with our food. So no, I didn't want to move, but I feel like it was our first time there, we weren't offered the bar to begin with and after being told we would be able to order from the happy hour menu then told another, I just feel like that was their mistake and they should have granted us a one time to order from that menu.  Good thing is by time we were done eating, we were pretty full and didn't want to stuff ourselves.",

My wife and I had been to the branch in Rancho Cucamonga before.  Unfortunately, this branch was not nearly as good as the one we visited before.  We arrived with our friends at a little past 9pm on a Thursday night.  We had taken a day trip to Grand Canyon West, and our friends were craving some good bbq.  I remembered that there was a Lucille's in Henderson so I recommended this place cause of the good food we had tasted at their Rancho Cucamonga location.  We arrived here tired and very hungry.    The place was still busy when we arrived, but they were able to seat us right away.  We were served our food right away (about 5 minutes after they took our order).  So were were very happy about that considering we were starving.  Unfortunately, the food did not taste fresh at all.  The babyback ribs were tough and tasteless.  The bbq tri tip was also tough and chewy.  Sides and bread were fine though.  Looking back, we should have complained.  We were so hungry though so we didn't want to wait for anything else.  Anyways, we left unsatisfied although not hungry anymore.  I'd still go back to Lucille's.  Just not this location (at least not go there close to closing time).",

Why I mention this is that they were all seated after us. The Restaurant was overloaded with diners.The Fire dept. would have closed them for this. So anyway we finally got some beverages after 30 min of sitting and waiting. One of the employees approached the table and spoke to the person who had made the reservation over a month ago, asking who had she spoken to about the reservations. Now mind you there had been communication 3 times that to include Lucilles calling her the night before. Next, we were all handed salad plates and we received some biscuits.  Another 30 or so minutes went buy and after some complaints we were served some Turkey and Ham on platters.. few minutes goes by and we received some mashed potatoes, and than after a few some dressing, Not sure if we ever got any cranberry sauce, and than some sweet potatoes..The real joke came next we were delivered a platter of salad after all the above..Now we were prepared because we still had our salad plates, I even asked is this normal and the waitress asked if I wanted a bigger plate.. Hilarious. unfortunately all of us had used them for the dinner.I had used a bread plate for my potatoes.At the end of this joke a waiter came out asking if anyone wanted pie..Hmm some had whipped cream some didnt. All in all this was the worst Thanksgiving .Shame on Lucilles,. Best part..we paid for it..No compensation, no apology",

Checked up on us frequently and was great with refills!   There were 5 of us and our server suggested to get 2 of the BBQ specials for 2... There was so much food that I can't even remember what was in it, and we even had to take most of it home. It came with an appetizer, sides, the Que and dessert. Out of their 3 BBQ sauces, I liked the tangy one,... Wish I could remember what the name of it was but I was suffering from food coma.   Return visits?

Lucille's has some marginally okay food offerings (although a True BBQ connoisseur would hold issue with this place) and it has a friendly and attentive enough staff.   But the True measure of Lucille's becomes clear when you get the bill. Perhaps the high cost of rent in this hoddie-toddie little shopping district of Henderson is to blame, but when you sum up your dining experience (as you take out a small loan to pay for dinner) you realize that the food was certainly not worth the price.   Why, oh why, can we not have a good BBQ place in Vegas?",

I was craving Lucilles so we started to wait.  After waiting for 10minutes..I went into the bar and snagged a table (bar area is self seating) as soon as a couple had left.  Our server was very very friendly.  There was about 5 min left for happy hour and she made sure to hook us up! Of course...we started w/ alcohol!!!  We got the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer.  Ive never really had them before and have been wanting to try them..and these did not disappoint!!  There were lightly battered and fried and served w/ some type of sauce that just completed the dish.  For my main entree I ordered their Fried Chicken w/ garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  Everything was awesome!    After eating here...I was sooo stuffed and bloated!!   There is just so much food on the the plates!!!  If you have to take breaks while you eat the food on your plate then you know thats a lot of food! Very good food~~!!",

I had lunch here a few years back and I don't remember loving it as much as I did tonight. After enjoying the biscuits, my wife and I split a half order of onion straws. They were seasoned perfectly and were piled high (we couldn't even finish the half order).  I enjoyed mine with the spicy table side BBQ sauce, whereas my wife opted for the sweeter original sauce.  For dinner, I ordered the 1/3 pound  BBQ bacon burger with shoestring fries. I was already stuffed before my dinner arrived, but decided to put my big boy pants on and eat up. My wife ordered the tri-tip sandwich and was in heaven. We enjoyed our dinner so much, she couldn't stop smiling and I couldn't stop nodding in acceptance. As if we weren't fat enough, we opted for the small banana pudding for dessert. Who doesn't have room for pudding?   Bottom line, I regret not coming back sooner than I did. This place is great!   ****** They keep the air conditioning on full-blast, you would be wise to bring a sweatshirt or light jacket.",

He never introduced himself to us so I can't even say who it was.  Our food came after quite some wait 30 minutes at least. We had to ask the food server for more water.

The waitress seemed to be slammed but being in the industry we were more than ok waiting.  We ordered a couple of drinks from the happy hour menu and decided to try the mac and Hesse, spicy bbq bites and the deviled eggs.  Let's start with the deviled eggs. Nothing amazing but well prepared and seasoned. The bacon on top truly sets it off. We gave these a steady 4/5.   We had asked for water and some corn bread. Took nearly 30 minutes to get it. Every time our waitress looked at us she had the whole \"doooohhhh forgot to get that for you\" look on her face. Poor thing was really busy.  To it disappointment the bbq bites were just cut up chicken tenders. Sadly they were dry and only flavor on them was from the bbq sauce. Have to give these a 2/5.   Lastly was the mac and cheese. It's a bacon cheddar mac so once again it's hard to screw up. The noodles seemed dry. Almost like they had made this batch way early in the day and it was just thrown into the the microwave.   Drinks weren't bad for the price and neither was the food but overall stick to the regular menu and fork out the extra money for the babybacks.",

They have great lunch and happy hour specials making it an affordable option.  They also have lots of options of side dishes including coleslaw, mac n' cheese, fries and beans.  You also get a warm cloth after your meal to wipe up all the BBQ mess!  My personal favorites here are definitely the biscuits, the ribs and the pulled pork.",

Early in the day (our reservation was for) to avoid the avid typical dinner rush hour. We all arrived on time, after numerous times going up to desk to check on how much longer, we were told it's been a very busy day, our reservation then seemed  almost as if it was a moot point. Then they'd say, there are a few reservations before yours. What was the point of my reserving a time slot for a certain time I wondered?  45 minutes later we were finally called. Our friend had to keep asking for his cup of coffee, they said no clean cups as soon as there is one they'd bring it to him. Look, we know, we understand it's a blessed treasured holiday, but wait for a clean coffee cup, he finally after asking again said, bring me a dirty cup then, like really have anyone quick wash a cup and bring him his coffee.  Again we know it's a day to be thankful, ever so thankful we are/were. All 6 of us had not even warm food (in other words not even room temp) and upon mentioning that to a guy server, he looked at me and commented  \"really?\" then walked away offering nothing not even sending a mngr over to take care of us. Dinner was nothing great altho our peeps that ordered bbq said their meats were very good, cold but good.  I didn't have a biscuit, my husband did and said they were dry. A lot of $$$ for a lackluster holiday meal. I know this is reading as a negative Nels report, trust me I wish this report would have been favorable.   Just our assessment, unfortunately another eatery we won't come back to.",

Our waiter was spread so thin that he was slacking on his things to do ie: drink refills,extra napkins,needed condiments and he was so worried about his tip. Everytime we are something he was like \"isn't that awesome I told you would like it\".With appetizer and main course then with dessert. Like I wouldn't know my okra was good or my baked beans were good or my cheesecake was good. I guess I just expected better because of prior visits. I hope that our service and food is much  better than this visit was. We usually go to Red Rock location. Great service!!!! Awesome food there. This was The District location. Maybe they need some training from the Red Rock location. I hope that things are better on our next visit because we truly love this place four it's awesome food.",

Our server only came around to do the minimum required of her duties but most of the time we were left waiting for several minutes just for simple things like a side of ranch or a refill. I don't plan to return.   I'm not usually a complainer and would rather give a positive review (look at my reviews on Yelp to see for yourself), but Lucille's needs this feedback to hopefully make some improvements.

Plus, we could see the smokers from where we were sitting, so that was cool.   However, the food was so sugary, which I know is to be expected from bbq, but I felt like going into a sugar coma or laying down for a nap after our meal. Plus, it was pricey!

The service was a little on the slower side, but besides that I thought it was a great BBQ restaurant. The atmosphere, ambiance, and location of this restaurant makes it amazing! The food I thought was delicious, it was above average BBQ food I've had, but wouldn't put it in \"wow that was to die-for category\". I got the tri tip sandwich with potato salad for a side. The sandwich was HUGE so I was able to take 1/2 the sandwich home for left overs!  For appetizers, I tasted the friend onion rings, fried green tomatoes, and fried okra....all amazing! Definitely would get this appetizer again, just be prepared to eat and be full.",

Kept checking on us until we were ready to order and she brought out drinks and biscuits right away.  Yum!  I had the peach lemonade.  It was really fresh tasting and had a nice peach flavor.   I had the 1/4 chicken and pulled pork lunch special with the honey roasted peanut slaw.  I always get no sauce and then worry the meat will be dry.  But I did not have to worry here.  The pork was nice and tender and moist, not dry at all.  The chicken was mostly meat which is nice since I don't like chicken on the bone.    Others had the loaded baked potato, the rib and meat lunch special and the pulled pork sliders with a variety of sides.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.    This place does a great bbq and has lots of options and sides.  Definitely a good choice for a group.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Lucille's for many years now. I've always considered them the best when it came to BBQ, especially baby back ribs. The atmosphere is really great, it has a southern down home feel.  However, overtime, the prices keep creeping up. I understand inflation, I understand prices increase, but right now Lucille's has reached the level of \"fine dining\".  The final straw was when I came in today and noticed the \"rib appetizer\" was removed from the menu. The rib appetizer was the last option to have an affordable meal. The appetizer was a half rack of ribs for $15.99. Get that, add a side and your are just above $20 (excluding drink). However they got wise to that option and your only option now is to get the half rack meal at $23.99.  Lunch for me today cost $60 (that included tip). This was ONE person mind you! Again I'm not a cheapskate. But this place is not one you could visit often, only special occasions.   So I had to go two stars just because of value. I understand that BBQ isn't the cheapest to produce, but at this price I'd rather go to a steakhouse. BBQ should be something friends and family can enjoy often. For now I'm off to find another BBQ place to frequent, or just bust out my smoker and do it myself.",

They had a special holiday menu that looked really good, but my friend and I decided to try their traditional barbecue. I got the brisket, and my friend got the pulled pork. The place was PACKED, but the wait wasn't too long (luckily they had a text system so we could wander around the casino until the table was ready), and the hostess was super efficient and knew exactly where to seat everyone. The service in general was extremely good; our waitress was super polite and efficient. The ambiance was homey, the noise, though packed, wasn't loud, and it was safely cocooned in its own area of the casino, so you couldn't smell the cigarette smoke from the casino floor at all.   The food, though, was disappointing. Both my friend and I got very dry meat that didn't seem to have any flavor to it, and we both thought the garlic mash on the side was reminded us of instant potatoes instead of real ones (which doesn't make any sense, because I'm sure they made it fresh from scratch, but it just tasted like the crumbles you get from a bag - I don't know why). For the price, the food was abysmal. I'd heard good things from friends about the restaurant, so maybe it was just a one-off bad experience, but I wished I had chosen a better place for my holiday meal, and I don't forsee myself returning.",

So the food will hopefully overcome the poor service... (Originally based on the wait promised when we first arrived- I gave them one star)  But here is my update based on the rest of the evening.  I wanted to revise my review based on the great service provided by our server, Tanner. I'd give him a 5 stars for his patience alone... He did an amazing job accommodating our very large party of 16.  He was genuine, friendly, and very knowledgeable of the menu choices.  Earlier in the day, my cousin tried to make a reservation.  She was told that they were unable to do a reservation.  However, after finally being seated, I noticed 2 of the booths adjacent to our large table had \"Reserved\" signs... Hmmm... Conflicting story..   My husband and I arrived at 5:25pm.  We put our name down (as the rest of our party was parking)  The hostess advised 30-35 minutes.  My husband and I ordered drinks and waited in the bar, and when the rest of our party walked in we went and sat in the parlor.  At no time were we given an update on status of our place in line.  After over an hour, I got up to check.  Still, not ready.  Then my cousin checked, followed by her sister.  She had noticed that a large party (appeared to be over 6 people got seated right away)  I finally got up and told the hostess that it was ridiculous that we had been waiting an hour and a half at that point.  With that being said... What my husband and I had I'd give it 4.5 stars, and I know others in our party loved the Ribs, and Chicken.  So based on our poor start to the evening averaged with the great server and the delicious huge portions of food... I'd give it a 3.5...",

The non-alcoholic drinks come in mason jars, so they don't have to fill up my ice tea as often.  The flavor is above average.  There are other bbq restaurants and chains that are more authentic and have better flavor.  But in the Las Vegas/Henderson area, this place isn't bad",

    "text": "I guess I just have bad luck with this place. First time I ordered was about 4 months ago (ordered to-go),  I was told my food will be ready for pickup in 20 mins. I got there 30 minutes later, waited at the pickup  window for 10 mins, just for them to say, Oh, sorry, it'll be another 10 mins. I finally walked out with  my meal about 20 mins later. The food was ok, (I got the baby back ribs). I lived in the south so I know  great barbecue when I taste it. It wasn't bad, but wasn't mindblowing.  Fast forward to yesterday. I was craving ribs so I called to place an order for pick-up. I'm thinking there's  no way they'll mess things up twice, and the food was decent enough to give it another try. I was told my food will be  ready in 20 mins. This was during my lunch break so i had limited time. I drove over to pick it up 30 minutes later.  Lo and behold, I was met with errs and uhhs, the genius that took my order didn't put it in. He said \"well, I didn't put it in, I'll put it in right away...\" I was so irate. I'm standing there starving with limited time for lunch. I asked how  long it'll take, he said another 20 minutes. I just had to walk off. No point throwing a tantrum and wasting my energy. I  figured I'd reserve my energy for this review.  I highly doubt I'd be back.",

Be smart, go to the bar order some drinks then take a seat at one of the tables when they open up. Much faster than waiting for a regular table.   If you go during happy hour on Friday or Saturday, be prepare for some loud music. We were treated to a nice blues band during our dining experience, but it was loud.  The barbeque is just okay and nothing to rave about. But their Gumbo hit the spot and was delicious. I was so glad that I ordered this instead of the ribs or the chicken.",

My hubby and his friend ordered some ribs and sausage which they shared along with a GIGANTIC Cobb Salad(more than enough for 5-6 people FYI)and they took home the rest.

In the past, we were told that they serve off the lunch menu on weekends, and we used that menu.  Lately, I've been given the dinner menu on weekends and holidays .  When I ask, sometimes they get me the lunch menu and sometimes they say, \"We don't do it on weekends, holidays, etc.\"  Last time I asked if I could have the lunch menu on Veterans Day and they said no.  I asked the server to check with the manager, and the they brought me the lunch menu.  What's the deal?  The dinner portions are too big for lunch, and the price is much more doable for lunch.  Having said that, the food is outstanding, especially the fried seafood platter with shrimp and fish.  They're still making money by letting people order lunch during lunchtime. Anyone know the truth?",

Appetizers can be large enough to accommodate a reasonable lunch portion, and salads can be large enough for two full portions.  Some choices are offered in half portions.  Fountain drinks arrive in a large mason jar.  At first, I wondered why the glass was so huge.  Then I realized it's a matter of convenience for the server so he/she won't have to run back & forth for constant refills. The bisuits are delicious with just a touch of sweetness to them.  The apple butter is technically not True apple butter, but it's delicious.    The food is delicious, and service is good.  Our server was quite friendly, and service was spot on.  The hot towel provided at the end of our meal was a particularly nice touch.    Give Lucille's a try--it's worth a reasonable wait time and you won't be disappointed!  It's good, but not exceptional.  In my opinion, I would consider giving a 5-star review if Lucille's reduced the sizes--and accordingly, the prices--of their fare.  Reasonable portions at reasonable prices would fit the Southern BBQ joint motif better.",

The complimentary biscuits were ok, but I would have preferred cornbread. We shared a whole rack of baby back ribs ($26.99) with sides of coleslaw and BBQ beans. The ribs were tender and smokey with a bit of char  that gave it an added crispy texture. The beans were a bit spicy and the coleslaw was underdressed and bland.  We also got a side salad ($2.49) and a baked potato ($2.99) -- both typical and mediocre fare.  Our kid had the chicken fingers ($5.75) -- hand-breaded strips with ranch dressing on the side. He seemed happy enough with them and the fries, which I stole several of, were deliciously crispy and light.  Add a Fat Tire ($5.25) and a margarita ($6) to the dinner and it wasn't exactly a cheap meal. With the tip, dinner for the three of us came out to over $64. It satisfied a craving for BBQ, but I still prefer Buzz BBQ and Famous Dave's.  The atmosphere is what you would expect from a BBQ chain -- tchotchkes and flair everywhere with a southern feel. It's a fairly large restaurant in The District area of Green Valley Ranch with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but expect a wait on weekend nights.",

Where else can you get barbecue, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, and fried pickles (pickles are not my thing, but I tried one anyway, ALMOST edible) on one platter?  The brisket was tender, moist, and delicious.  Cheese and jalapeno grits? Check.  Peanut slaw was uniquely tasty.  The only glitches were (1) a few minutes delay between delivery of meals one and two and meal three (both meals were brisket but with different sides, so ... I dunno) and (2) I am PRETTY sure one of our \"brisket\" meals was actually tri-tip, but it still tasted great and we shared, so it was no big deal.   We will ABSOLUTELY be going back.  I can  go out to eat and have barbecue with my girlfriend!  YAY!",

My husband had the baby back ribs with potato salad, barbque beans and we shared a side of amazing fries our first time there. He loved the ribs and he gets the barbque beans EVERY time we go they are THAT good. Second time around he got his shrimp po'boy was excellent, the batter on the shrimp was authentic Louisiana style and was second to none. Third time there he got the Hot links sandwich, while it was good it didn't blow him away. Most recently he got the Jumbalaya which can only be described as AMBROSIA...food of the gods.",

What was a little odd was that they had live LOUD music blaring, and a lot of families with little kids. You couldn't have a conversation without yelling at somebody. We didn't have kids, but I would have walked out if I did. Anyway, I ordered brisket -- which I think is the litmus test of any decent BBQ joint. It didn't pass. The brisket was dry and hard. I even picked it up to see how easily it would come apart. It didn't. The gang had chicken and ribs, and they were happy. Maybe I should give up on brisket. I've been to this place for lunch a couple of times and the barbecue is decent.",

The reason I'm writing this review is due to the exemplary service we received from our server Alexis. I'd go to Lucille's every day of the week if I knew she'd be my server, she's THAT good! We had a few hiccups with our meals and she handled everything with a great smile and enthusiasm to make our dining experience a great one. As for the food, I had the blackened catfish which was good. My wife had the fried catfish and shrimp. The hiccups were the greens that came with my meal had pork in them (we don't eat pork) and my wife's fish needed to be cooked longer. We also had the roasted artichoke which we weren't too fond of. The fried shrimp and grits were the stars today. My wife's meal was completely replaced even though we'd eaten most of the shrimp and grits, my greens were replaced with mac n cheese and the artichoke was taken off our bill. This is what I call service! This is what I don't mind paying higher prices for! With everything that happened we still received that good ole southern hospitality from start to finish! We are two VERY satisfied customers!",

Very dry; wouldn't have been edible for me without the butter.   Entree: I had the chicken sandwich. Good, but nothing spectacular. The sides were much better ( I ordered the Mac and cheese and sampled the cheese grits and potatoes from other people).  Service was okay, two people checked in on us but we still somehow sat around and waited for a bill and change.  Overall, not a good, but not a bad experience. I wouldn't recommend it based on my experience, but I didn't eat what they are famous for either.  EDIT: I was contacted by the business owner here on Yelp and he was apologetic about my experience and genuinely seemed to care about what I had to say. For this, I will give four stars because he could have just as easily ignored it.",

I also love the gigantic mason jars they use for drinks, never need to ask for a refill which is always a plus.  How do they always pick such perfectly ripe watermelon?",

I took the Sirloin Tips, which were delicious, and my sister in law went with the BBQ ribs -- she loved those.  My wife took the pulled pork, and that was probably their least successful dish (too dry and underflavored).  Many choices of side dishes and I really liked the peanut slaw and the corn on the cob.  Surprisingly strong wine list, although we ordered beer out of tradition...  Food came fast, huge servings, and we enjoyed sitting outside -- they use water spray to cool the terrace, so even in 100 degree heat it was very comfortable.",

They all were ok and I found the meat was a little tough. The mac and cheese was spot on though.   The service was horrible!  Our back waiter was initially really good. He got our drink orders and even gave us some tips on what to order. Then we never saw him or our waiter throughout the rest of our meal.  We had to flag down other servers for drinks and our check.  The sad part about it was the restaurant wasn't terribly busy and our section was practically empty. Terrible service always makes me never want to go back to a restaurant.",

When it comes to chain places expectations are relatively low.  Right off you'll love this place-outdoor seating lots of indoor seating and a bar-incredibly friendly staff and the place feels 100% BBQ with the smoker going right in the dining room.  They start you off with Sweet Tea in a mason jar and a sprig of mint then some biscuits with Apple BUtter.  We ordered the 3 course FEAST for 2 and the Ribs & Tri-Tip Lunch Special to-go.  The food came out in a very timely manner. We started off with the biscuits and a house salad for 2.  Next came the BBQ platter-1/2 bbq chicken,4 St Louis Style Ribs, 4 Babyback Ribs and 1/4 Lb of Beef Brisket. Plus we had 2 sides-Mashed Sweet Potaotes and Macaroni and Cheese.  The food was fantastic. Apple-wood smoked meat-great smoke flavor tender & moist. Plus they have 3 sauces-Memphis,Regular & Hot/Spicy-All were great but I luv the Hot stuff.  The brisket was by far the BEST anywhere in Las Vegas!! The Ribs were Fantastic-Smoked through and Tender. The Tri Tip was out of this world too!!  Definitely a TOP BBQ joint in Las Vegas/Henderson!:) If this place was closer, not so pricy and had a drive-thru I would be 400 lbs by Xmas!!",

Very southern home-like, I passed the porch area on the way to the bathroom and I felt like I was in Georgia. You can see in my picture it has whicker-furniture with a few rocking chairs.  Get my drift? I had the strawberry lemonade served in those mason jars. Very delish and the jar adds to that southern touch.  Just like everyone mentioned they probably serve some of the best biscuits, which is something I look forward to each time I come here.  I also love the fact they're pretty much unlimited and this visit I had 2. Wow not so good on my waist line considering the apple butter is amazing as well.  We came during lunch time so I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes.  The sandwich was pretty tasty, good amount of BBQ sauce on it. I really like the crunch from the onion strings and I also like the fact they have a quarter of a pickle on the side. The mashed potatoes were okay, but nothing to do back flips over. The only downer about this place it's kinda pricey, but I suggest to go during lunch making it more reasonably priced.",

We went this week and asked for Kris as our server since she helped us the last time and was so patient and friendly with our 3 kids.  This time was no different than the last time, she was super friendly and attentive.  We usually get ribs and a pasta dish but this time we just ordered 2 racks of ribs with mac n cheese, veges, and corn on the cobb.  Ribs and Mac n Cheese were excellent.  I didn't try the other sides but my husband said they were good.  We ordered an appetizer that isn't on the menu, its the potato chips but we have them make them like nachos, they are so yummy!  Do your self a favor and ask them for that next time you go in.  Overall a great family place to eat and huge selection of things to pic from.",

After being seated in an area where I only saw families with children, I asked one of the hosts if where I sat was specifically designated for families. His answer was: \"It's based on server rotation\". Which was BS. A bold LIE. My friend and I were the only adults without kids seating in that section.  Food was not as good as I've had at other Lucille's. Onion Straws were very salty and greasy.  We order Baby back ribs dry with sauce on the side and they were NOT served as requested.  Will not visit this particular location again.",

I ordered the sample lunch special, your choice of one rib and two other meats plus a side. I had the beef ribs, hot link and brisket. The sauce on the ribs was good, sweet, tangy and tender meat. The link had a great spicy kick and not at all greasy. Brisket could be cut with a fork and great with one of their custom sauces available at each table. Their pale ale was a bit hoppy but most micro brews are. I tried the fried pickles, the batter was light and tasty but I wasn't a big fan. The potato salad and peanut coleslaw were excellent sides so all in all this was a great meal.  Lunch special prices were very good. I hope to return and check out their live music sometime soon.",

We found out about the restaurant through multiple referrals from locals and tourists. We typically use the \"call ahead\" seating option and are seated promptly upon arrival.  Trying to find a parking spot is usually an ordeal as this seems to be a very popular area of Green Valley.  We especially like the Friday and Saturday night live blues bands.  The reason we keep coming back is the good ol' southern cooking!! We have no complaints about any items we have ordered and especially love the Sweet Tea (served in Mason jars) Southern Fried Chicken (breaded and fried like Grandma used to make) and the biscuits with apple butter!! Felt like I was back home!!! At the end of your meal, they bring warm wash cloths to \"clean up\" any sticky fingers.which is a nice touch!  We can't wait for the new location to open at Red Rock Canyon which is closer to our home, but in the meantime, we will continue to travel the 25 minutes to Green Valley!",

    "text": "So my father in-law is in town visiting and I find myself exploring smokehouses and steakhouses to make sure he gets his meat. Lucille's was a nice surprise. There were plentiful appetizers with the grilled artichoke standing out the most. Whats great is you can get discounted appetizers during happy hour in the bar area, or do what we did and order 1/2 orders of about 3-4 appetizers. Still good portions. The veggie burger was also tasty. (black charred grill marks on the burger, cheese, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and a sesame bun.) The burger came with your pick of 1 side. I choose the sweet potato fries which were fat and crispy. There are plenty veggie sides to choose from! The waiter was very helpful and friendly. You can also substitute the veggie burger on any of the other burger/sandwiches. My in-law ordered the brisket salad (large) and thought it was excellent. Be aware that the large salad portion is HUGE! But salad did look yummy and fresh so Ill be ordering the vegetable salad next time. The sweet tea and lemonade is served out of big glass jars and are delicious. However, I don't know if they give free refills. All around great place to hang out, eat, and drink. Nice atmosphere!  Oh the complimentary bread basket is delicious biscuits with apple butter. Hard to just have one of these babies!",

This time there were a few of us, so I got to explore the menu a little.  Fried pickles are a staple, and Lucille's does them right! I decided to go with the pulled pork sandwich.  It was everything I expected...and more! Pork was tender and smoked perfectly then served on a grilled potato bun.  I added some of their sauce and bam! All was right in the world.  Until I couldn't finish it of course, because it was huge.  Had mac n cheese as the side and that was also delicious.  Everyone has their preference, but I really like it here.  Definitely prefer over Famous Daves, but in the bay Area there's no Lucille's yet :(  My husband did have a minor gripe, he thought he'd had better tri-tip elsewhere.  But he likes everything else at Lucille's so this was just a small fluke.  Never had dessert here, but I can only imagine....",

I noticed 2 separate diners taking their ribs to go. (it's not going to taste better in your house, lol). I dont understand how a place that specialize in ribs makes ones that are inedible. My cousin had to return the baby back ribs. He took one bite and was unhappy. He took another bite and just couldnt do it. I said, are you going to finish and I swear, I thought he was going to cry!!! AHAHAHHAHA. So, he switched them out for the st. louis style. Those were not any better. He really did enjoy his chicken wings. That's the only thing he liked there. He is a HUGE meat eater. He LOVES BBQ! How did this place not deliver? The sides I tried were ok. The prices on the sides were fantastic. Every side is between $1.50 and $2.00. The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were pretty good. The fried pickles were real good too. I like that you can get 1/2 portions on most appetizers. The service was absolutely awful. I mean, awful.  The bartender was \"working our table, and she was horrible. I had to get MY OWN SILVERWARE!!!!We did get another waitress for the last 15 minutes of our meal. That was redeeming, but I was not impressed. I did however enjoy the bread pudding quite a bit. This is a place I will not go back to. Between LOUSY service and lackluster food, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere.",

Julie, maybe you were having a rough night. Maybe your boyfriend dumped you or your boss made you pull a double. The fact is, I don't give a shit. You were rude, unwelcoming and a TERRIBLE waitress. I ordered a water with lemon to start. A drink menu was no where to be seen so our options were limited--would we like a lemonade? Possibly, but we don't know what you have on your menu because you've already left us to get our waters. Except 10 minutes later we still don't have water. And when we do, there's no lemon in it. A minor detail, I know... and really, I can get over this if you had managed to get anything else right. You put the cherry on the icing when I asked for a lemon and you tell me it's going to be a minute. Ok--because you're growing them out back? Because you have to cut it with the shards of glass you're going to remove from your ass since clearly you have something stuck up there? Whatever, you pissed me off...  To the food... you bring out some biscuits with apple butter. This excites me, except the biscuits were flavorless and there was no amount of butter to help this. I order the soup and sandwich combo with the loaded potato soup and  1/2 a chicken sandwich. The soup was spicy but didn't have a ton of flavor. And loaded? If by loaded you mean basically a white broth with tons of pepper in it, then yes, it was loaded. I'm still waiting for the cheese and bacon to come in somewhere...I order the chicken sandwich plain thinking I'll douse the warm chicken in BBQ sauce and then eat the bread. I tell Julie this, but alas, she doesn't hear me. She hasn't heard a damn thing I've said tonight.... So the sandwich comes and the chicken is cold. On Texas toast. With loads of mayo, tomatoes and lettuce. Um, NO. Every other sandwich on the menu is warm and comes on a bun--WTF? I tell Julie I'm not pleased and she stands there looking at me and then asks if I want something else. I say I'll think about it and she leaves NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN! Or until I've picked my way through my sandwich and just want to go home. You come by to remove our plates and ask if we want dessert. I had been contemplating key lime cheesecake because I'm a sucker for all things key lime... but I'm pissy and head to the restroom. While I'm there, husband orders key lime to go and the check. You grab the check with our credit card and run it in record time and tell us to have a good night--except we've yet to receive the key lime pie. No, this feat would take you an additional 10 minutes to get. Because apparently, the only thing you can do in record time is make me want to leave.  Overall, I think this place is highly overrated. If in the mood for BBQ, this will be the last joint I ever recommend or go to. Lucille's--you get ONE star because my husband liked his ham sandwich. I would take this away for the awful service but I'm not that mean....",

    "text": "Probably the best barbeque in the Las Vegas valley! We first learned about Lucille's when we were attending one of UNLV wine events at The District in Henderson. They were one of the food vendors and giving out samples of their BBQ Tri tip. Wow! If what they were giving away was this good, we couldn't wait to try their menu. We were back there for dinner the next night and have been going there ever since.  Since they're located in The District, parking is always a problem in the evening but you can park at the nearby Green Valley Ranch casino and walk over--just follow the aroma of their smoker and you can't miss it. Another issue is because of their popularity there is almost always a wait to get in. If possible, make reservations on the phone or through their web site. This doesn' guarantee that you'll get seated at your scheduled time, but you will be ahead of all the walkups. If you have to wait, you'll be given one of their pagers and you can either sit in the small garden area or window shop while you wait to be called. If there's a band playing in the bar, try to get a table outside (if it's not too hot) or as far toward the back as you can. The band is usually playing too loud to have a conversation.  The wait staff has always been friendly even with the pace they're serving people. Drinks are served in Mason jars and are quickly refilled when getting low. While you're waiting for your food, you get to snack on fresh biscuits with their fantastic apple cinnamon butter. These usually go fast on our table, so we order a second round of them while we're waiting. Portion size for the dinners is large, so unless you're really hungry you might want to skip the starter. If you do, the BBQ Rib Tips are very good. Depending on my appetite, I usually order their Back Porch which includes a half chicken, tri tip, and choice of ribs. If I'm not quite as hungry I'll order a full rack of either the baby back ribs or the St. Louis spare ribs. Brenda splits her choices between either the BBQ tri tip or the beef brisket. All the BBQ dinners come with two sides and we'd recommend the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and the creamy coleslaw. The honey roasted peanut slaw and the mashed sweet potatoes are also good and we'll swap between the four on our visits.  All the meats are tender and flavorful. You can order them wet (with your choice of sauce) or dry. If you order them dry, you can choose between three different sauces on your table to spice up your meat:  * Hot and Spicy - tomato, garlic, hot sauce and hot pepper. Not as hot as Devil's Spit at Famous Dave's, but very good. * Original - tomato, molasses, vinegar and spices. Sweet and mild, but with good flavor. * Memphis - tomato, mustard, vinegar. Tangy with a bit of a kick.  This is one restaurant that we seldom have leftovers to take home--well, okay...we do take food home but that's only because we order another set of ribs to go.  This still is our favorite BBQ place in town, but because it's out in Henderson, we don't get out there as often as we'd like. Now we'll usually just stop by Famous Dave's which is a lot closer, their food is almost as good, and it's a bit cheaper. Lucille's has been touting a new restaurant in the Summerlin area for almost as long as they've been in Henderson. Their web site says it will be at the Red Rock Resort, so we'll finally have one a bit closer to us.",

On our last night here, she asked me if we could eat here as she missed this place. I was down and even though my boyfriend doesn't like BBQ he agreed to it as well. We had a 30 minute wait but by the time we were seated we overhead the wait was an hour. Glad we got here when we did. Our server was SUPER friendly. Service was a tad bit slow, but the place was busy. We decided to our the combo platter and just share everything. We got the beef rips, tri tip and chicken with cole slaw, mashed sweet potatoes and the baked beans. Everything was sooooo yum! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The mash tasted like Thanksgivings and the beans were nice and smokey. After the meal, a hot towel is brought to you to clean off all that sticky sweet sauce. Even the non-BBQ loving boyfriend said the food was amazing and that's telling you something!",

Whenever I'm in at the Green Valley Ranch, despite several excellent dining options, I have to eat at Lucilles.   They start with killer biscuits and apple butter, and their drinks come in massive Mason jars.  I usually get a chicken dish, and every single one has been sooooo tasty.  This past weekend, I got the Cajun Chicken sandwich and it was so good, I'm tempted to drive the five hours back to Vegas for it.  On previous visits, I've gotten the Po' Boy and the Southern Fried Chicken.  All are heart-cloggin' good!  I've heard that they have good desserts, but the portions are so big, that I've never been able to order one.  The decor is corporate-country.  The seating isn't terribly comfortable and the restaurant is a little loud, so it's not a place to linger over your food.   There's usually a wait, unless you get there early.   After dinner, you can walk around the shops, or hit the casino for gambling or a movie.",

The ribs are wonderful, and you can choose from three different sauces to put on your ribs: Old Fashioned Barbeque, Memphis Barbeque, and a spicy barbeque sauce. The biscuits were soft, warm, and the cinnamon butter was an added bonus. The service was friendly and attentive. The day I went which was a Saturday, their was a live band playing the blues. In order to be fair, I do highly recommend this estabilishment, but be prepared to have up to a 90 minute wait, and Lucille's does not take reservations.",

I started off with a Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade... good lemonade with some vodka, can't ask for a more refreshing alcoholic drink.  For the entree I ended up sticking with the Back Porch theme and ordered the Back Porch entree which included Ribs, Chicken & Tri Tip Platter and two sides... yeah I'm a fat-ass, I don't deny it.  Anyways, the tri tips were overcooked; the bbq chicken was very good, but needed more sauce and the ribs were perfect.  For the sides I got the mac & cheese and the sweet mashed potatoes, which our server said were their two best items.  The potatoes were a little too sweet and almost tasting like pie filling, the mac and cheese was basically flavorless, so was very disappointed by that.  Ah well, I tried it and it was ok, I'm sure I'd give it a second chance at some point... probably just get the ribs on their own.  Also, the biscuits with the apple butter... awesome.",

This is more of a 'premium' BBQ restaurant if such a thing exists, based on its good location and food.  Expect to pay a little more (perhaps $25 - $30 per person) for your meal here, with a requisite quality improvement over the standard BBQ restaurant, in my opinion.  Can get loud, and I prefer to sit in the main restaurant area, vs. the bar area or the 'verandah' type area (which gets hot or cold easier).

I highly recommend coming here for their happy hour to get a little bit of everything. They also accommodate couples with their plates that can be shared (I bet two individuals will be satisfied).",

Last came dessert, and I would highly recommend the Snickers ice cream cake. You'd be smart to share with someone as it is enormous.   The service was a little slow and they didn't initially ask us if we even wanted dessert. In the end the food is what won, so hence the five-star review.",

    "text": "I hate to do this to a business but in this case this business has grown too large and forgot about the customer. My wife and I ordered food a couple of Sundays ago when we went on to the yelp menu online. We ordered enough food for six people and the total came out to just over $120 online. I had no problem paying for it so I went to the location and started speaking with the cashier and one of the managers. I let the manager know that I would be ordering roughly $3000 worth of food for Thanksgiving day for my place of employment, as I'm in charge of feeding 160 people. They showed me the catering menu and made sure to remind me that I needed to put the order in well in advance. I've ordered from Lucille's for catering orders in the past several times and the quality of the food has always been good. Not to mention when I'm ordering for 160 people I want a company that can handle that volume and do it right. The food has to be fresh. Well, to my surprise when I was done speaking with the manager I saw my bill for the food that I was ordering right then. The bill was roughly $145, which was about $20 more than I expected. As I have no problem paying for food that I've ordered, the money wasn't the issue however I went online to yelp and saw that the price clearly showed a lower price by about $25. The manager put all of the blame on yelp and said that the yelp website should've been changed a year ago but yelp refuses to work with Lucille's and therefore the price would stand at $145. I can understand that sometimes errors happen however this mistake could happen to anybody and I don't feel that the customer should pay for that so therefore I asked him to remove the $20 difference but he wouldn't do it. No hard feelings, it was the principle of it for me so I refused to pay for the order and they got stuck with a large order of food. The manager wasn't too happy that I refused to pay for the food, however I left out of there without food altogether. I went to another restaurant and ordered my dinner for the night. And a day later I contacted another restaurant in town and ordered $3200 worth of food for my team to be catered on Thanksgiving. I'm now in a position where I need to order roughly $3000 worth of food for Christmas day for my team in one location I won't be considering is Lucille's. Sometimes it's the smallest things that you would think people would want to correct or make right for the customer. I can understand that some people would say that it wasn't their mistake and that yelp should share some of the blame. In my opinion the management wasn't empowered to do what was right for the customer. That decision cost them not only a $20 difference that night but rather $6000 in future business. Only a corporation would make a mistake so foolish as a restaurant with a properly trained management team would understand what the right thing is which is why my business went to a mom-and-pop barbecue shop in town who decided to stay open for me on Thanksgiving day and will do the same thing on Christmas Day and I feel good about giving them the business. I apologize for any spelling errors, but I've been speaking into the phone because I don't have the patience to type a review this long on the phone's keyboard.",

The bb ribs were one of the worst I have had! They were far too salty and very dried out. The chicken was undercooked and rubbery! Let's just say We could have done better at home for 1/4 the cost. We were so disappointed! We were starving and had an event after so even though they offered us another meal we were not able to wait for it. It made for a good doggy bag...literally! My pulled pork sandwich was good as was the Apple butter/biscuits. The couple we came with had no complaints about their food. Time to find a better rib place!",

    "text": "I don't know why I had never written a review of this place.  Lucille's is the place where I get my fix for a giant (full rack) BBQ pork ribs!  I love them just the way they come out on the plate.  I don't even to use those extra sauces on their table.  Their St. Louis style BBQ beef ribs are awesome, too!  I took my old friend from San Francisco who was visiting Las Vegas over to Lucille's, and he was excited and even exceeded his expectations.  The only place I remember which is comparable with Lucille's was \"Bobby Rubino's Place for Ribs\" which used to be right on the Fisherman's Warf waterfront in San Francisco.  It actually used to be \"DeMaggio's\" owned by Joe DeMaggio until Bobby Rubino's came to town and bought the place.  Now, I believe they changed hands with \"Joe's Crab Shack.\"  Any rate, Bobby Rubino's was my place for ribs when I lived there.  A few years back, I found Lucille's over in Henderson, Green Valley Ranch District and I was totally overjoyed!  I still have toss-ups between ordering pork ribs and beef ribs because they're both my favorites.  I always order the onion straws for an appetizer, and that dipping sauce which tastes like aioli sauce with BBQ accent is absolutely out of this world.  Well, there was one thing out of the menu that I almost spitted out of my mouth when I bit into it and chewed on it....  My dear friend wanted to challenge something weird, and he ordered the fried pickles.  I already knew what it was going to turn out to be.  I just can't stand cooked pickles!  Nope, not even cooked cucumbers!  That is disgusting!  It shot my mind back to the 90s, where a \"Valley Girl (San Fernando Valley)\" would say 'Grody to the max!!' or something like, 'Gag me with a spoon!' and that's exactly how I felt, sending shivers up my spine.  I literally almost spit that awful thing full force right in my friend's face from my mental state of chaos and shock.  He just ordered it as a conversation piece; but, it never made it to a conversation.  He hated it, I hated it even before he ordered it, but never imagined a cooked pickle can be so disgusting.  I could even gargle and wash it down with prune juice if I had to.  I bet they put that on the menu for someone just like my friend who likes to play Russian Roulette with food.  Lucille's is always fun to go.",

    "text": "I could eat Lucille's every day, every night and every hour of the year. I would be 200+ pounds, but I would be happy.  Lucille's recently released their new menu which denotes gluten free items. If you're worried about not having a bunch of choices to eat here, have no fear. You will have plenty of options here if you have a gluten allergy, and all of the staff seems very knowledgeable about the allergy which makes me feel very comfortable eating here.  I love the feel of this restaurant and the layout. You can either eat outside, inside in the enclosed porch, in the main dining room or in the bar. My husband and I like to go to their late night happy hour in the bar because the music is great (we love the blues), and the drink and food prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and booze we consume.  It is easy to share a plate at Lucille's, especially at dinner time. We normally split an entree and get a half appetizer and/or salad which is plenty of food for us. We have yet to eat anything at Lucille's that isn't delicious. The brisket can sometimes be a little dry, but most of the time it is juicy with just enough of the fat and barbecue bark on the outside to make my tummy sing. I am a huge fan of their smoked chicken, whether it is the breast of dark quarter, I could eat it all. The trip tip is always perfectly cooked, and my husband and I can happily eat our way through a plate of rib tips in under five minutes. The hot link is great, and if you want to go bananas, try the beef rib. The rib is a meal itself with a decent amount of fat, but it reminds me of the ribs I ate in SC which were always delicious.   Their smoked brisket salad is exactly what I wanted it to be. Smokey, sweet, savory and delicious. We've had most of their sides, and my favorite are their sweet potato mashed potatoes, creamy coleslaw and potato salad. Beware: If you get the baked potato, know that it is massive enough to share between two to three people! And their stuffed baked potatoes are nothing short of carbohydrate goodness. Sometimes stuffed potatoes end up being all potato by the end, but they really stuff the potatoes here at Lucille's, and they are great!  All in all, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed if you eat at Lucille's and love barbecue. Regardless of the type of barbecue you like, you'll be satisfied eating at this restaurant.  P.S. Their drinks are crazy good. I like their Skinny Drinks, especially the one made with gin and basil. Not too strong or sweet, but it packs a punch! My husband is a fan of the Crocodile Cooler which, even though it is all alcohol, masks its strength with the right combination of juices. Just know that after one, you better eat some food to help sober you up!",

So if you are in the mood for a pretty good meal AND you like barbecue in general AND you don't mind eating in a restaurant that is excessively permeated with wood smoke AND you don't mind paying prices that are more suitable for really good barbecue, then Lucille's will  suit.  As I said, the barbecue is pretty darn good. The side dishes are mixed. The baked potato, which I have had three times has always been room temperature--which in summer is cooler than outdoor temperature. The staff is pretty good as well. Somewhat attentive, almost giving off a sense that they care about the fact that I have chosen to bring my family to dine. But not quite. The Prices are high for both the quantity and quality of the meal. Not outrageous, but higher than I would expect . In summary, the meat dishes are good, the sides are marginal to lame and the wait staff often seems to be 'calling it in'. Not my favorite, but not the worst either. It will work in a pinch.",

My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here a couple years ago and they were very accommodating and everyone had a great time.  My friends and I have gone here for a number of Happy Hours because they have pretty great specials on apps and drinks.  You pretty much can't go wrong with one of their platters.  Half a chicken, ribs, meats, and pretty good sides.  Their cheesy grits are a family favorite.  There have been a few rare occasions where service isn't up to par but for as many times as I have gone here it has been pretty good.  The food is good and for Happy Hour, this place is great!",

We had 9 in our party and no one had any problems with the service or food, everything was \"great\"! I grew up in Texas where BarBQue is King, but the food at Lucille's is as good or better. I had their fried okra, the best I've ever eaten! I also had the smoked beef brisket, it was so gooood. Their sweeten iced tea comes with mint and served in a gigantic mason jar, the flavor was unbeatable. I look forward to going back again the next time in Henderson.",

Also ordered brisket and it was also really good. The peanut slaw is the pretty good add well add the vegetables, corn and garlic mashed.   Regular BBQ sauce is tangy with a little kick. The boyfriend liked the spicy BBQ sauce. A lot of choices on the gluten free menu. I'm glad to have another GF restaurant with so many options.   We ordered the food to go, so I had a Bloody Mary while I waited. It was really good. The perfect drink for a  New Years Day hangover.",

    "text": "We have been to Lucille's a few times now. This time the food is good as usual, but the service sucked. I don't really want to point blankly out the waiter's name for the public so let me just say his name starts with \"X\", if their manager checks the review then he would know whom I am referring to. From the moment I sat down to order drinks, I could feel he wasn't to happy to be working tonight. No smile, no greeting, didn't even know what tea options they serve and was reluctant to check. The appetizers were served within a fair amount of time. But the BBQ food we had to wait for at least 45 minutes from the time we placed the order. For some reason, pretty much every other table around us got their food before we finally got ours - some table came after us. We have two little kids - by the time the BBQ got here they've all stuffed with appetizers and it's extremely hard for them to sit and just wait for us to eat.   The food was too much that we ran out of room on the table to put them. We did not realize how big the family BBQ platter could be so we ordered that and also another platter to share; we also didn't realize some of the sides were the same from the two platters. We ended up finishing not even close to half of the food. The waiter, IF he paid any attention to customer needs, or if perhaps he did not calculate that by having us order $250 worth of food and drinks he could get a decent amount of tips from one table, he could and should give us a heads up of how much food we actually ordered. When the humongous BBQ plates arrived, NO waiter bothered to either empty out some of the plates/glasses from the table, nor help us move around plates. They dropped the plate wherever they could and was gone like wind. My poor father in law had to hold a hot heavy plate on his hands till we moved things around - including remove some plates/cups/menus on the floor.  It took them forever to serve the food, however, they seemed want to rush us out toward the end. While most of us were still eating, the waiter came to ask twice if he could serve the hot towel! Overall, I am definitely not happy with the level of service tonight - particularly this waiter. You get much better service in any fast food restaurant. Through out the 2 hours we stayed in the restaurant, he never smiled except once he squeezed out a fake smile. And all the time if he ever came to our table, he seemed so rush to get out there.",

There's another spot in Vegas with better BBQ but Lucille's can hold it's own versus every other BBQ place in town.    There are three BBQ sauces on the table and you can pick and choose what you want.  I usually blend all three together and make one badass BBQ sauce.  I change up my orders every time but the briskets and tri tips are good.  My last order was the half chicken and two meats, they were dry this time so ehhh but the other times I've had Lucille's it was so finger licking good.   Let me tell you how to get here though, it looks weird on the Yelp map.  Head south from Green Valley Parkway and make your first right into the District then make a left and go around to the immediate right.  You'll see it!  The happy hour is only for the bar or bar area, so feel free to just sit in this section rather than wait for a table on the right side of the restaurant or outdoor patio seating.",

She made the right recommendations, helping us order a good amount of food to make sure everyone was taken care of.

They went above and beyond to help us serve the wedding cake, even though that wasn't a service they normally do.  At our request, they were even willing to prepare to-go meals for individual guests (though we decided not to go that route)!

We sat in a waiting room off of the bar area and were perfectly comfortable waiting there until it got to be about 4:45 and we went to the front desk to ask how much longer that it would be. They said only maybe 10- 15 minutes. That puts us at 5:00 PM. Again, we had  some pretty comfortable seats and continued to wait. After 15 minutes, my wife went up to ask if out table was ready. they said maybe 10 more minutes. When she came back, she was texted that the table was ready and that we needed to come to the front desk to be seated. we now waited for 30 minutes at the front desk as they did not have the table ready. I asked what was going on after 10 minutes of waiting and the young man at the front told me that his manager was to blame and that it was not his fault, so I asked to speak to manager. He never came. Again, we ended up waiting that 30 minutes and then finally we were brought outside to this tent area. I told the girl out there about how our Thanksgiving was going up to then and she said, she was sorry and that she would make sure that the night got better now that we were in her area. Basically, they ruined our day, night and Holiday. Things did not get better, food was maybe warm at best. Nothing was hot and it was like we were being served leftovers. The Manager had to have overbooked and was not qualified to run a small diner. {no offense to diner owners] Terrible service, terrible food, terrible experience....NEVER AGAIN!!!!",

I do enjoy Lucille's, it's not the best BBQ joint I've eaten at here in Vegas (hence the 3 stars), but it's tasty enough for me to come back.   The items I've tried from here that I really enjoyed were there mac n' cheese, biscuits, and cornbread! Talk about carb lovin'!! Although this may not be some of their speciality items there's something about them that is special and uber tasty.  Oh yea, and their fried pickles are a must!!   A few items I've tried that fell flat were the grilled chicken (on a salad) and the rib tips. The chicken tasted more like flavorless broiled chicken. If the salad wasn't already so heavily dressed I would have added one of their various homemade bbq sauces to spice it up. Their tips were one item I was really looking forward to, but they ended up being super fatty and chewy (if you're looking for a really great tip place see my other reviews).   I do appreciate the ambience. It is lively and casual and great for families. I also appreciate their 7 day a week Happy Hour from 3p-7p and again from 9p-close. Who doesn't want to \"get happy\" every day?! If you have yet to try this place I say give it a go...it's worth a try!",

I hate sitting where the waiters zoom by every second,  it's a weird feeling. We asked to sit at a booth and the waitress was more than cool about it. We were served hot biscuits with brown sugar butter, they were addicting. The drinks came in awesome huge  mason jars and they kept coming.

In Sacramento.  Lucilles is just one of your all American bbq smokehouses and honestly if there's anything I love about America, it's their style of smoking meats and smothering them with bbq sauce.  Alfonso, our waiter had an INCREDIBLE attitude on Christmas Eve. It's super busy, our wait was about 30 minutes and if it wasn't for the fact that I was with family I'd honestly been a bit humbug.   I ordered Lucilles smoked brisket that they carve to order. It was tender, and juicy and oh lord the sauces. The brisket didn't come with sauce but right on the table you have your choice of hot spicy, traditional, and one that's on the sweeter side. I chose for the hot spicy because, I like things spicy, just like me. lol",

I've been coming here since it opened a long time ago.  I've seen many of the bars and restaurants in the square change so they must be doing something right.  I will say that sometimes the meat doesn't have a pleasant smoky flavor and sometimes the service is terrible but all in all I would say that it's a step above regular American chain restaurants.  Take home a bottle of the Memphis sauce.  That's good.",

Bobby was my server and did a wonderful job and was very timely with refills and making sure I had everything I needed.   I ordered the Brisket and Chicken which I have attached a photo of. I will admit it's missing a bite of brisket since I couldn't wait to dig in since it looked so good. I also ordered half and half (half unsweet/half sweet) tea which Bobby made sure was just right. The brisket and chicken were both cooked just right and came with warm BBQ sauce. The potato salad was also very tasty. My only reservation about the meal was that it was a small portion for the price but the meal was wonderful.   For dessert I had the Old Fashioned Banana Pudding which I was kind of disappointed with. Having lived in the south I expected bananas to be in the pudding. The menu said the Old Fashioned Banana Pudding included fresh bananas, but my serving did not include any.   Despite the small serving size and the lack of bananas in the pudding I would still recommend this restaurant to others. I liked Lucille's so much that I bought $50 worth of gift cards.",

    "text": "I generally write good reviews for most businesses and rarely give a bad rating for a place... so this experience is solely based on the service we got when I dined there.  I came with a friend one night to dine.. we are both very pleasant people who are kind and courteous to everyone especially waitstaff. I've worked in the restaurant business for several years before so I know how it is. I always try to smile and be friendly... I'm generally a talkative person anyways.  Given this was a night where it was NOT busy. The waiter we got was not a noobie to the place as he knows how to answer every question we have as well as he seems to do a decent job at providing service. I cant find the receipt to locate what my servers name was but he's a average build caucasian gentleman with a full on beard & mustache with brown hair.   Well we ordered appetizers the deviled eggs and it tasty. then the food came out afterwards.  10-15 minutes into eating my food the waiter brought out the wet towels and check to the table!!! I was blown away! I literally ate like 10% of my food and everyone can clearly see my plate was pretty much almost full.. wow. . just wow.  I will post a pic of my plate of how much I ate when the towels were brought out. I was not happy about that and was so appalled! I planned on ordering dessert as well cause all the pics on yelp looked amazing.. bad sadly I did not due to the fact that the waiter was basically telling us to pay and get out!! by bringing the check and wet towels out way before I was even ready for it. SMH. even with this type of treatment I still tipped him 15%.. I'm just not that type of person to give bad tips.  generally I would tip 20-30% for decent good service. for amazing service I have given 40-100% before.. I was feeling extremely disappointed and insulted that this happened when overall I was a pleasant customer to him.   The restaurant owners or managers need to look into the quality of service their waitstaff provides and train their waitstaff better so that this kind of treatment doesnt happen to the next guest. Sadly I would not be coming here for another meal. I will take my money elsewhere.",

They also helped us navigate the menu to find the option that would satisfy best.   The portions were large. One of our people had a large plate of ribs, smoked in-house. I tried the burger.

You can grab a catering menu at the restaurant or online and then call the catering number to order and schedule your delivery.    They have many different priced offerings from\" pick up your food\" to \"fully staffed event serving services\".  We chose the \"bring the food and set up\" option and it was perfect.  All the guests raved about the food and we had quite a bit left over.  I would highly recommend their catering department for personal parties, casual wedding or corporate events.",

The first time my husband and I went there we ordered our own entrees, each coming with 2 sides. We had plans to get drinks after dinner, BUT we barely made it home before we immediately slipped away into food comas.  We've since learned our lesson. Recently we ordered carry out (yes, they offer carry out!) and this time ordered one entree (a rack of ribs) with 2 sides of course (sweet potatoes - they gave us mashed and fries! and greens). We both ate until we were full and still didn't finish it all.   The restaurant itself has a nice lay out with several different dining areas, including a traditional dining room, bar/ lounge, porch tables, and a covered outdoor space. It actually feels like you're dining in someone's home no matter where you are seated. This is the best place for BBQ in Vegas I've tried so far!",

The inside Has a lot of different rooms you can be seated in. We had to wait about 15 minutes, but they had chairs to sit on so you can be more comfortable.  The lunch prices aren't too bad, the menu is limited though.  The night prices looked high to me, but meat in general is more expensive so that is understandable ( Plus I am kinda cheap :) ....  I don't drink but the bar area was full and the people looked happy and comfortable in there.  Worth a shot if you are in the Green Valley Ranch area.",

Lucille's offers large portions of their signature BBQ with the cooker right in the dining room! They have a fantastic southern drink menu with things like mint julep on it. This place is always busy and has a great outdoor patio. They offer both Memphis and Texas style BBQ which is good, but always makes me wonder if they would do one better if they focused. The take out is awesome though!!! A great night in the district if your interested in good BBQ none the less.",

    "text": "I have loved this place for years, but my last two visits have been terrible. On my first visit my wife and I were enjoying lunch when I spotted a cockroach walking across my table.  I didn't make a big deal out of it I merely put in a napkin and handed it to the waitress.  She was very nice and got her manager.  I didn't expect anything as I know this was not intentional, but we did lose our appetite.  The manager apologized and ordered us a round of beers which we didn't want and didn't drink as we were there for lunch and didn't intend on drinking to much.  The manager then apologized for sending us an additional round and comped our first round.  We didn't go for a few months.  I recently returned on Sunday and had some of the worst service I have ever had.  I was there for lunch again, and the bar area was pretty slow.  Our waitress came by in about five minutes time which was not a big deal.  We ordered waters and a ginger ale which they were out of.  When the waitress returned with our water she took our order a burger, a BBQ salad, biscuits and fried pickles as an appetizer. We received our pickles pretty quickly but no utensils no extra plates and no biscuits.  We then waited a total of 30 minutes with no contact with our waitress.  This was the first time I have ever walked out of a place.  I didn't want to deal with the waitress so I just went to the front to pay for our pickles.  The cashier was confused as to why we're leaving, so she called her manager.  Her manager said oh it looks like you ordered some food it is almost ready would you like us to box it up. I said no thank you I would just like to pay for what we ate and leave and explained to her how long we had been there and how poor the service was.  She apologized and said that the pickles  would be taken care of.  To be honest I used to love this place and would go often for dinner and drinks with friends, but after these two visits I will never return.",

I find the BBQ average regardless of some of the raves here.  I go for the blackened catfish on mustard sauce with greens and mashed potatoes with an Abita beer.  Overall, an average chain type restaurant with large portions and a great location.",

I selected the baby back ribs, beef brisket and tri tip.  The baby back were great, soft and juicy.  The beef brisket was a little tough and chewy.  The tri tip was good.  I also tried the chicken and it was excellent.  The BBQ sauce on the meats was sweet.  Just like the sweet tea, it didn't have to be too sweet.  The waitress was very nice and the ambiance was quite homy.  Oh, also we had the onion straw's for our appetizer.  That was very good.  It was a lot of food.  Over all is what a good lunch.  ;o)",

Do not go to this restaurant if you are hungry or have some place to be. Average wait time inside the restaurant is hour and a half, average wait time if you call ahead to pick up is 40 min. longer than told on the phone. Everyone understands the need to wait for good food, however it is unacceptable to be told your food is ready and then forgotten because of horrific communication skills held by the employees.",

Loaded with personality, and I'm talking about the atmosphere and the staff in this Cajun/Creole influenced establishment when I say that, this place had an ambiance as welcoming a lemonade with your best friend on the screen porch during a warm summer night. It was a fun place to take the kids. Both times we went there was live music and all seemed entertained when our little ones decided to groove to it right next to our table. The smoked chicken was delicious, the onion straws were sinful and the ribs were out of this world! Even the sides were incredible --- my mouth is watering thinking about the garlic mashed potatoes.  Reasonable prices for what you get.  Pretty good kids menu.  Great people watching.  Call ahead to reserve a table, the place is popular and you will wait if you don't.

    "text": "I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  The great thing about eating BBQ in places in the South such as Memphis & Nashville is that I now know what good BBQ is. The bad thing is trying to find good BBQ in the Desert. Luckily a couple years back I was introduced to Lucille's  BBQ. Their food portions are great from your meal to your dinner salad or sweet tea you're gonna be set. Though not usually a Sweet Tea fan I always start things off here with one because they really have the mix just right and it adds to the whole BBQ experience ; )  They always hook you up with complimentary biscuits & butter which are very addicting if you're hungry and not paying attention. My Girlfriend ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer which is apparently a big favorite here and definitely worth a try. Then without warning a giant slab stockpiled with food is dropped off in front of you as you're informed that's your meal. I ordered one of many different BBQ combinations they offer and my plate had a Spicy Hot Link which is a personal favorite of mine at Lucille's, in fact I'll usually order it on the side if it's not included with my meal so needless I strongly back this item if you don't mind a little spice. Pulled Pork which was very moist & tasty, and BBQ Chicken which this time was pretty dry when usually it's excellent. The kid in me always has to get a side of Mac & Cheese and I went bananas when I found out they had sweet potato fries. The fact that the fries were amazing confirmed I was not dreaming. If you live in Vegas it seems that not enough places have/have good sweet potato fries so bonus points for Lucille's! but it's been 5 hours since my dinner and I still can't believe I ate the whole thing.",

The barbeque was generally Kansas City style, everything was served \"wet\" (cooked with the sauce on it already). Very good BBQ, outdoor seating, a very LARGE jar of muddy water (arnold palmer)...can't really be beat. Good escape from The Strip if you're a visitor. Plus you can check out the Green Valley Ranch, which is a really nice Casino next door. Service was average, prices were pretty good for a good BBQ joint.  Went there on a Saturday night once and they had a live blues band. They were enjoyable, if not a little too loud on the volume (it's not a rock concert and the bar is tiny!). This is a good bet for BBQ if the mood the strikes you.",

We bring all our friends here and it is the first place they want to go to when they come back to visit again.  You can smell the smoky goodness from the parking lot and the taste of the ribs is even better.  I have been a die hard pork rib lover for many years, but I have to say that the Beef Ribs (also known as Beef Candy in our house) are in another category of superb.  But wait -- there is more.  Although it may be hard to pass up the ribs, I often do, in favor of the gumbo -- rich with roux, smokey with chicken and sausage and sweet with rock shrimp.  And my husband will come just for the greens and grits, though I prefer the crisp fries and the creamy garlic mashed spuds.  Don't worry about filling up on the tasty appetizers and entrees, the desserts are less than stellar.  If you have a craving for tender smoked meat with a variety of sauces you will be totally satisfied at Lucille's.",

We went around 8:30 pm on a Thursday, so we had no wait for a table.  As for cleanliness, I have to say I can't stand sitting where there are dusty, dirty hanging light fixtures over the table- who knows what might fall into your food?  No such problem here- the fixtures were spotless, and the floors and tables were clean.  I was able to try a little of several items: beef ribs, pork ribs, fried green tomatoes, biscuit, baked beans, cheeseburger (medium rare!), and shoestring fries. Everything was delicious.  At the table are three types of barbecue sauce to choose from, one of them hot, which I tend to avoid (my hot sauce-loving friend says it wasn't hot at all, but I thought it was comfortably spicy). All of them were quite good.  The place is a tad pricey- we paid about $60 for two sodas, a beef rib appetizer, and our two entrees.  They put a basket with two biscuits on the table, and thank goodness there were only two because we would not have been able to eat our dinner! Neither of us could finish our meals anyway, so we had to take them home. I will definitely be back. This is the best-tasting barbecue I've had so far in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Since I've recently resigned myself to chain bbq, I thought I'd give Lucille's a try, even though it's not in my neighborhood.  I didn't care for it. We went for lunch and the hostess was friendly and the room seemed comfortable. After a very short wait we were taken to a table right next to a large table with several small children. I quietly asked not to be seated right next to little children and said any of the other tables on the other side of the room would be fine. The young man seating us had a short conversation over his headset and said that none of the other tables had waiters. I asked again and after another headset conversation we were seated at one of the farther tables. Our waiter was friendly, took our orders etc. I ordered a bbq platter that came with 3 st. louis ribs, two additional meats and a side. Biscuits and butter were served. The biscuits were dry and had a sprinkle of sugar on top. I don't like the sugar. When my food came, the \"3 ribs\" was the very end of a rack, the three tiny skinny bones ranging from about 1.5\" to about 3\" in length and very thin and dry. I asked the guy who brought my food if that was their idea of 3 ribs and he said yes. I asked my waiter if the tiny little piece of pork was indeed 3 ribs and he said, \"yes, that's three ribs, you got an end piece.\" I was not at all happy with their idea of three ribs. I was expecting three normal sized ribs. The manager was walking by, I got her attention. She asked me how my lunch was and I said horrible, that  I was not at all happy and I explained my disappointment with their idea of 3 ribs. She said she'd bring me some larger ribs. Once I was finished with the rest of my plate, she brought me a half order of baby back ribs saying she didn't want me to go hungry. I don't like baby back ribs which is why I ordered the st. louis ribs in the first place. The baby back ribs were over charred, dry and not very good. The Hot link I ordered would have been fine if it wasn't covered in sweet sticky sauce and the pulled pork was dry. The grits were awful, tasting of red bell pepper more than anything. My aunt liked her sandwich. The tables had three bottles of bbq sauce, an original, a spicy and a honey mustard (?). All three were very sweet.  I won't return.",

I would order one of the  BBQ feasts that feeds a whole family.  I would gorge myself to death before whatever else is going to take me gets a chance.  And I would, quite simply, die a happy camper.  Back in the real world, however, I didn't do much better.  I had the combo platter with BBQ half chicken and baby back ribs.  This comes with your choice of 2 sides - I decided to go southern all the way with southern sweet potatoes and braised greens - and a homemade biscuit with apple butter.  It's eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head good.  And it held up extremely well with the Murphy-Goode Petit Verdot I paired it with.  Okay, so maybe a True southerner I'm not.  Now, I've been here many times, and admit that it can be hit or miss for whatever reason, but tonight I finished the meal feeling so satisfied that if I were dying, I would be okay with it.  As it stands, the calories are going to kill me because I'm still living on, but I don't have to worry about that until the morning.  Good night and sweet and tangy bar-b-que dreams to all!",

I made our reservation for a party of 5 three weeks in advance, yet they sat us at a tiny table hardly big enough for four people. I even pointed out to the waitress that we we're ordering the $200.00 family feast and that there would Not be enough room for the food dishes. She said she would \"check\" for another table. Instead they sat a party of two at the table for 6, right next to us. We had to put stuff from the table, BBQ sauce, sugar etc. on the floor in order to make room for the food! They bring the salad to the table and before we can even serve it to anyone they are bring out the main course!! We had to Not eat our salad, box it up in order to make room for the main dishes.  The turkey and stuffing were Great. The ham was dried out and the green bean casserole was horrible. The mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes were delicious.  In retrospect, I should have said \"Sorry, no way we can sit here.\"  I work to hard for my money to ever waist it here again. There are to many other choices that won't allow this to happen.",

    "text": "This place...so freaking messy and sticky and spicy and gooey good!  Came here on a Saturday night with my husband and even at 8pm there was a 40 minute wait.  I wanted to go shopping during the wait and with this incredibly handy (and maybe new...I've never heard of it anyway) method of TEXTING you when your table is ready rather than giving you a flashing and vibrating apparatus that only allows you to meander a short distance from the restaurant, shopping would have been possible!  However, my practical, resourceful and uber intelligent husband discovered that we could seat ourselves in the bar area immediately.  My suggestion is to sit there (assuming there are available tables) if the wait's long and if you don't have kids with you, of course.   We don't drink so our dinner order was placed almost immediately (hey...we were hungry!) I wish I would have gotten our servers name so I could give her a shout out here cause she was awesome.  Attentive and funny and super knowledgeable on the menu (girl could rattle off the litany of side items like nobody's business!).   My husband got the back porch trio dinner - ribs, chicken and tri tip.  He chose mashed potatoes and cole slaw for sides.  He devoured it all.  Oink...Oink.  I got a bite of his chicken and it was seriously amazing.  Tender and flavorful and fall off the bone juicy.  The potatoes were good - mashed and seasoned and delicious just like Mom's homemade.  Here's the thing - my husband is super picky about his cole slaw.  It can't be warm, it can't be watery, yada yada yada.  He was concerned that he may not like it and told the server as much.  She graciously told him that if he didn't, she would gladly replace it with something else.  Well, he loved it.  So much that he wanted to order an additional side of it.  See, they put horseradish in there so it has a little kick.  Yummy indeed. I got the Mardi Gras chicken which, truthfully, is enough for 3 or 4 people.  It's two massive chicken breasts that are breaded and fried on top of mashed potatoes, covered with this creamy, spicy cajun sauce that has andouille sausage, bell peppers and shrimp in it.  There's a lot going on with this one but it all works so well together.  It comes with grilled veggies that are a perfect compliment to the heaviness of the chicken/sausage/shrimp/spicy goodness.   But let's talk about the biscuits.  Praise the Lord they are out of this freaking world.  Huge and fluffy and warm and soft on the inside with a golden brown outside.  They come with honey butter that is slightly sweet, extremely marvelous.  I really feel like if all I had to eat that night were biscuits, I'd be completely and totally content.   The bar area is loud.  Actually, the entire restaurant is loud.  There's a lot of seating, both tables and booths, and they even have a wraparound indoor veranda of sorts for seating as well.  The decor is decidedly southern (no doy kee) with lots of interesting things to look at and admire.  (Bonus - just outside of the restroom is a leg lamp, the one made famous in the classic movie, A Christmas Story.  It was a major award, you know!)  The photo ops are endless here.   All in all, I love Lucille's.  Like love it so much that I'd be 200 pounds if I ate here too often.  It's a splurge for sure, nutrition wise.  Money speaking, we spent about $60 before tip for the both of us.  It's worth it.  Promise.",

For starters had Lucilles Onion Straws served with their own BBQ Ranch dipping sauce. The half order is more than enough for 2 people. Must try!   Biscuits served for free came hot with a nice pairing of their own apple butter.   Main Course had the BBQ Half Chicken & 2 Meats. The 2 meats were pulled pork & a cheddar bacon sausage link. The chicken was tender & juicy. The sausage was grilled to perfection. The pulled pork tender.  Our server Nicole was the Bomb!  I have to stop in more often. Food was delicious.",

Lucille's can be a 2 star on one day, a 5 star on another, a 4 star on another, and a 3 star another. Luckily I've never had a 1 star.  The interior, exterior, and environment are very cool. There's an outdoor patio and a live band. There's a bar. It's located in the District and near the Green Valley Ranch Casino. They have a huge BBQ smoker right in the middle of the dining area which I thought was just for show until they started bring out a ton of meat and loaded it. They serve drinks in a mason jar. Their BBQ sauce is good and can be purchased. Their accommodating for large groups. All very cool things.  Their food for most parts was alright, sometimes inconsistent. I've been here a few times and had decent BBQ ribs for a chain restaurant but satisfying. I've had ribs where the meat just pulled off the bone. Most recently it was pretty overcooked and barely had any meat on it. What little meat it had tasted good for something tough chewy but everything else was good. Sometimes the portions are huge and sometimes they aren't, you leave hungry.  It's a good place to chill and hangout, watch a game, have a few drinks, and eat some BBQ. If it was around the corner I'd be here almost everyday but not always to eat. I'd probably be back if out of town visitors or others wanted to go or if I was in the area. There's another Lucille's closer to me now though.",

Had the buttermilk biscuits with honey apple butter. Highly recommended! Moved on to a combo of ribs, pulled pork and burnt ends. The ribs and pork were excellent, as were the sauces, but the burnt ends were too fatty for my liking. The side of sweet potato fries was very good though. Washed it all down with a delicious homemade strawberry lemonade.  Prices are no bargain, but not outrageous either. All In all, a tasty spot for lunch.",

    "text": "This is our go-to BBQ spot. We've eaten inside a few times, have called and gotten items for pick-up, and even done the advance thanksgiving dinner ordering (ask about it at the take out counter in November).  One of my favorite items here are the rolls and apple butter. I love them so much I've ordered just those for holidays (but they come free to your table when you dine in). They are sweet and buttery, and the apple butter adds a cinnamon sugar taste as well. Recently, I also enjoyed the brisket sandwich, which was packed with brisket and topped with coleslaw. It was messy but delicious. We've done happy hour a couple times here as well and gotten drinks and small bites. Last time I was in for happy hour, it was only available in the bar, so keep that in mind if you plan on coming for that.   One thing I learned this last time we got food for pick-up, is that the full rack of ribs is only a few dollars more than the half rack, and is worthwhile to get and have lunch for tomorrow too.   Ultimately, I recommend coming here, the food is good, it's average price for BBQ, and unless it's a holiday or you come with a large party, the wait isn't usually too long (you can also make reservations in advance too). Another way to go is that if it is a holiday and you don't have a reservation, you can call and find out the wait time and they can put you on the waitlist over the phone as well; or you can do what we do and just order for pick-up.",

The atmosphere reminds me of some of my favorite North Carolina bbq spots, casual and comfy. It is also situated in The District at Green Valley, so you can make a day/night trip with friends or family. My family and I will be back very soon",

The lunch was catered so they brought it to us, the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. I will end the catering part with that. I like it so much the following weekend; I visited the GreenValley location. The service was fabulous, and the food was even better. I ordered the pick two, tri-tip and pulled pork. So much food I needed to take some home. The leftovers tasted as good as it did right out of the oven.  Lucille's is my new to go-to place for client meetings and 2nd dates. I had the opportunity to have a pretty long conversation with the one server, and he even told me how great the management team treated the employee there, which adds to me going back time and time again.",

While waiting for my sandwich and devouring my biscuits and butter, the couple next to me ordered two orders of deviled eggs (didn't know they had them) and he kept offering and I'm not one to turn down food. Little to say after that I as well ordered to orders of deviled eggs on TOP of my delicious bbq brisket sandwich. The consistency of this place is honestly amazing.

The burnt ends were delectable. The tri tip and beef brisket were delicious. We will eventually return. I just have to get the image of the Mardi Gras chicken out of my head.",

My waitress was not so friendly. We did not go during a busy time and were a small group of 3. We did have a child, who the waitress ignored and did not bother to get their order after my husband and I ordered our food. I had to ask the waitress to add my little boys order since she started to rush off after she wrote the two orders down. Our drinks were never refilled and our check was given halfway through our meal, along with the hot towels. The service brings down the rating but the food, thankfully, did not disappoint.   I ordered the brisket sandwich. There was so much meat on it. It was super tender beef. The mop sauce that comes with the sandwich is a great addition. I would definitely order this again. For my side dish I ordered Mac and cheese on the creamy side so there was no cheese melted on top. I always get my Mac and cheese this way.  Possibly next time I visit Lucille's, I'll make the long drive to Red Rock since the food is good.",

I specifically told my daughter that I wanted the dressing and the fried onion straws on the side so my salad and onions would be crunchy. As I unpacked this pricey gem I first realize that there are no fried onions in the bag, strike 1. I'm not pleased because I see it's a boring mix of mostly iceberg lettuce with I swear 6 tiny half cherry tomatoes and a sprinkling of corn and black beans. Then the chicken pieces were not nicely cut bite sized and plentiful but instead a few sparse too large chewy chunks with a dab of BBQ sauce on them. The dressing was on the side but was way too sweet and tasteless and it didn't matter anyway because the salad was droopy and not even worth eating. I picked at it and ate what I could and tossed the rest away into the trash bin. What a waste of money and huge disappointment since I was very hungry. And this was labeled on the menu as a Lucille's favorite...really?!!!",

You handled the non-stop phone calls and to-go line well!   Tonight I tried the huuuuuuge, meaty Beef Ribs, hickory style (dry, no sauce). With this came two sides, which I tried the Mac n' Cheese and Vegetable Medley. So the Mac n' Cheese was deliciously cheesy and the veggie medley was good! These two sides went well with the super meaty ribs, it provided a good balance. I was super hesitant in getting beef ribs, because I've read in previous reviews that they were more fatty than lean. I can totally speak to that, these ribs are meaty, with yes some fat pieces but mostly lean pieces! Order these!  They also offer complimentary biscuits with their cinnamon smooth butter. Be sure to try these fresh biscuits, they make a great appetizer!",

We did a call ahead for seating because waiting in a restaurant with a 3 year old is no fun!!! I'm pro reservations all the way!!!  We got there and we waited about 5 min then got out table. This establishment is beautiful! It's spacious and has plenty of seating inside and outside. We got a table right next to the window so my daughter was enjoying all the people walking around The District.  We started off with the Brisket Nachos. It was a generous serving that satisfied 2 grown adults and a very hungry and grown teenage boy!   My husband ordered the Tri-tip sandwich, which of course I had to have a bite of! The meat was so tender and juicy that I kinda wished I had gotten it for myself! Both my son and I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and that was amazing as well! I was only able to eat half of mine, but it was so good that I didn't mind taking it him and eating the rest later.  The service was great! Our server was fantastic, he made sure that we were taken care of the whole time we were there.  We will definitely be back!!!",

The shrimp were ok and the beans were decent. However, the catfish and Mac and cheese were so flavorless they were dying for a pinch of seasoning. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting considering it is a chain restaurant, but I was somewhat disappointed. I would recommend of the watermelon lemonade and if you have a choice and server make sure you ask for colten. I also met one of the managers on duty who seemed very nice also.

The only reason, I gave 3 stars is because I enjoyed the food before. If I had to rate tonight's meal it would be 1 star if that!",

Can't miss the Mac and cheese, I think this is their signature side dish, it's literally addicting. Don't get full on the fresh hot biscuits, that alone is a meal in itself.

We were part of the onslaught of people who were waiting at the door, when they opened for the day.  We were seated exceptionally fast, and our server did an amazing job of juggling the 4 tables that were seated more or less simultaneously.  A \"Muddy-Water\" (their version of an Arnold Palmer), served in a Mason Jar, was a bit on the pricy side.  But the generous portion, and prompt refills, took the sting away.  My pulled pork sandwich was one of the best that I've ever eaten.  'Melt in your mouth' is a phrase that comes to mind, but still falls short of the actual experience.  Oops, I almost forgot to mention the atmosphere.  From the giant smoker in the middle of the room - nicknamed Smokestack Lightning, to the tasteful mix of both old school and more modern blues, the atmosphere added to the very enjoyable experience.",

I thought I was in for a real treat.  Being from Texas, I judge my BBQ on the brisket.  First, it must not have sauce on it.  Sauce should be served on the side.  The brisket came out and it was drenched in sauce.  And I like my BBQ sauce on the sweet side, with a slight kick/slightly spicy.  The sauce that was on it was HOT!  And my mouth was on fire.  I had a miserable case of heartburn the rest of the day.  I couldn't tell how good or how bad the brisket was because of it.   It seemed to be tender.  I had the sweet potato mash with it, and it was ok, nothing special.  The worst part of it was that I had the brisket (which there wasn't very much of it), the sweet potato mash, and a beer and it was $23.  I could have had this same lunch in Central Texas and it would have been about $15 at the most and would have been much better.  The service isn't great either and the servers aren't overly friendly.  Needless to say, I haven't been back to Lucille's, nor do I have any plans to do so.",

Our party ordered the fried green tomatoes and Okra for appetizers. Both had been frozen, poured out of a bag into a fryer. Served with a flavorless sauce.  Of of my party ordered pulled pork sliders with greens. The greens were a canned green. WTF. I order the cheesey grits with my entree. They were flavorful and full of large lunps the size of peanuts.   The meats were ho humm. Nothing to get overly excited by. The service was pretty lousey. Rarely saw our server (Kelly).

It's in the bar area only, but on Monday when we went the restaurant was full and the bar area was half empty... no clue why.   It's 4-7 PM M-F, and 9 PM - close daily. We ordered a disgusting amount of food and 2 22 oz drinks, all for $40 with tax and tip. Cocktails start at just $3.25 (I believe our 22 oz backporch strawberry lemonades were $4.25), and food was priced from $2-$6.   Hot link ($1.95)  Riblets ($5.95) Gumbo ($4.95) Irish Fries ($2.95) Sliders (2 for $3.95)  The winner for me was the sliders (your choice of pork brisket or chicken!), but the irish fries were a nice surprise - huge platter of yummy skinny fries topped with cheese and sour cream and other goodies. The gumbo was AWFUL (my family is from NOLA so I'm picky!). Overall great food, great drinks, great prices. We can finally afford to eat at Lucille's more often !",

It is so aggravating when you get your food to your final destination you discover you have something in  your bag of goodies that you either did not order or they gave you the wrong food but in Lucialls case i did not get what i checked in the online menu options. How difficult is it to read the exact same menu and get the customer the item they selected on a menu they provided for you online.   I should have suspected things would get screwed up when I first made a phone call to find out if they had any dinner specials. A girl answered in a Valley Girl., Kardashians stupid ass voice and said \"uh dinner yes we are open for dinner\". No I said do you have any rib dinner specials.  Again same voice like she just walked into the world of humans\" Uh yes we have ribs\"  I was so frustrated at that point I just hung up and decide on the online option.   Lucalls offers a great online experience. It is the rest of their process that needs improvement. . So with apprehension I ventured out for the first time with the online process. It was very intuitive and easy to complete the order. I received a confirmation email and a time that my order woud be ready. So far everything is perfect and exactly what you would expect from an online ordering process.   Assuming  everything i ordered is in the bag and casualy looking into the bag ,  I can see everything looks fine all food present and and accounted for. U get home and the nightmare begins when I take the food out of the bag.   1) They gave me the wrong salad. I ordered the Wedge and received a token house salad, I requested Blue Cheese and received Ranch.   2) I requested Green Beans with the St Louis rib dinner and received Collard Greens and Baby Back ribs.   3) The 3 miniture Shrimp and 1 shred filet piece of  Catfish dinner should be classified as an appetizer not as a dinner.  4) The Cajon  Pasta dinner was the only good item that I ordered. IT WAS VERY GOOD AND THE SAUCE WAS EXCELLENT WITH THE LINGUINE.   5) The ribs were Ok , nothing very special. If they would have given me the correct St Louis ribs I don't think it would have been any better.   6) Customer Service  When I had dinner there a few months ago at the bar, the bartender was excellent service was excellent very friendly. I would go back and eat at the bar. Not sure if I ever want to talk to the people they allow to answer the phone.  ALL THAT FOR $74.00 and no customer service other than someone did not read my selections from the online menu or check for accurancy. . I would probably go back for the pasta dish it was exceptionally good.",

Fortunately it was happy hour and not that busy so service was pretty good.  Started with the fried pickles and Irish nachos (great deal for happy hour!) but not into the pickles... The nachos were okay. Cheese got cold and hard.... Not bad but not great.  We shared a full rack ribs with beans and peanut slaw as our sides. Before we got our food, they brought out 2 biscuits and apple butter. Yumm!!! Must've been the best part about the meal. Then came to food... The ribs were a bit dry and not tender. The beans are too sweet. The peanut slaw was alright..  Thought I'd give it another chance by ordering dessert. And glad I did! I got red velvet cake with ice cream.. I am a sucker for red velvet cake! And I really liked it. But you can tell it's been sitting; the icing was kinda hard. But still pretty good. My boyfriend got the snickers ice cream pie thing. Yummy but real rich and real sweet. Big serving!  Overall, decent service, moderate food with big portions, good biscuit and dessert. 3 stars... maybe my expectations were just too high from reading such good reviews.. but I'd go Famous Daves over this place anyday.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW: So, hubby and I went back to Lucille's. Oh. Em. Gee. This was a completely different dining experience than the previous one. And reminiscent to experiences of the past, prior to the visit that sparked the first review. But I digress... We were seated immediately by a lovely young man a the host(ess) station. Our server, Claudia, was there at our table  mere moments after were seated, taking our drink order and offering us complimentary biscuits and apple butter (YUM!!). When Claudia returned with our drinks we were ready to order. As we were in the mood for a nosh, we stuck to the appetizer menu. We ordered the sliders, tritip bites, fried pickles and the hand/homemade BBQ chips. One word: DELISH!! Unlike the previous visit when the food was cold, ALL of our food was piping hot. Perfect. The beef was succulent, the sliders was seasoned well and portioned perfectly. Fried dill pickles are an acquired taste, very southern. I LOVED them. All in all this was a lovely visit. We will be returning, just not on a Saturday night. I think that that crew takes being busy for granted and as a reason to be lax on customer service. Claudia was DA BOMB!!! An excellent server who is attentive to her guests is an invaluable team member. She was just that. All in all everyone whom we came in contact during this visit was a delight. All of the food came out at the same time so that we could share. There was no waiting for anything.  Nice visit. Great food. Will be back.   Let me start off by saying that I have been coming here with my family since Lucille's opened at The District. We would come For birthdays, anniversaries, major school accomplishments were celebrated at Lucille's. Why? The food was excellent, the service was warm and friendly, end of story. So, what changed? I have no idea. But all I can say is that my visit on 2/21/2015 will be my last. While we were seated quickly, it took TEN MINUTES before someone even approached us to see if we had been taken care of, and might I add, while we were waiting the child at the table next to us kept making faces at us. Oy. When finally approached, we gave this person our ENTIRE order. At this point my husband and I had had enough of the child next to us with the oblivious parents, so my husband, quietly, approached a server and asked if we could be moved. After 5 minutes we were accommodated and seated in the bar area. Our former server personally handed us off to our new server. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. At this point we are at the 25 minute mark from when we MOVED. No one came back to our table to check on us, to see if we wanted another cocktail. So I went and sought out a manager. After another 10 minutes the food came. Then a manager appeared. Needless to say she was useless. While we were clear that we were not asking for anything to be comped she didn't offer anything up except a half assed apology. Her listening skills leave much to be desired and stop defending poor service. And now the food...in a word: AWFUL. I ordered the tri-tip salad. The beef was like shoe leather. And cold. In edible. My husband got the jambalaya. A dish he has had here many times before. He barely touched it. The appetizers were mediocre. I had a half order of fried green tomatoes. They were soggy and the sauce was coagulated on the plate. Gross. And the kicker? It took less time to walk to our car and drive HOME than it did to get our food at our table. I'm a local, and you can bet I will be telling people not to come here. And if I could give zero stars I would. Below sub-par. Very disappointing. Very sad.",

Service is pretty good. A few times we've had some waiters who seem very new and don't check in very often.  Overall, a really nice little bbq joint.",

I heard through the grapevine to make reservations and I am glad that I did.  6:30 on a Sat night and it was packed, the bar, the outside patio, and the dining area, hardly a free table in the house.  I loved the decor-- like I was visiting a family member's house in the South which made the place a very family/kid friendly environment.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive even with the place being so busy. Some one was always asking us for refills and giving us an update on our order.The tables were busy quickly and often.  I ordered the grilled salmon which was a very large piece of fish and a huge side of vegetables-cooked perfectly. My other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich. The mashed potatoes were a hit at our table.  We didn't have room for dessert so next time we may just order appetizers and dessert. As we left a small band was setting up in the bar area... This place was going to be rocking for hours to come. (PS. our bill came out to $50.77 so that was perfect deal with our gift card)",

The second time, for some reason, I left with a negative feeling. I remember paying $20 for hardly any food. On the other hand, my coworker paid much less and had way more food.  Anyway, that experience caused me to avoid the place for several years. I finally went back a couple of weeks ago. This time, we all ordered the same thing - the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich from the lunch menu. This time around, the price was right ($8.95) and the sandwich was delicious and satisfying. The problem now was that the service was incredibly slow. I'm going to chalk it up to being the last week of the year. Fortunately, the company I was with made it not seem that bad, but even the people I was with mentioned how slow it was.  Overall, I think Lucille's is A-OK. It's never been somewhere that pops in my mind as a choice I would make. But at least now, if someone wants to go there, I'm not against it.",

Probably the best service we've had at Lucille's.  We each got a burger, I got the Lucille's cheeseburger and my wife got the mushroom burger.  Both were cooked as ordered and served hot.  The flavor was terrific, had a great smoked burger flavor that is lacking in quite a few burgers from even supposed \"burger\" places.  And they don't skimp on the toppings either - both burgers were nice and sloppy - just the way we like 'em!  Justin kept our drinks stocked and was on top of everything - a great problem solver.  Will definitely go back to Lucille's!",

The plate size can go to a extremely large plate for just one person. Though overall, the burgers were like a usual burgers; but those sliders were something different.  A kind of taste you can't really get at a typical restaurant. That meals can get a bit on the expensive side; though based on the quality of the food and the price. Some of the orders are a great deal; deals like 3 kinds of meat for only around 10 to 12 dollars. I must state that I loved the fact they gave us mason jars as drinks instead of a typical water cup, really goes with the southern BBQ aura of the place and gives you more to drink. Specially if you order one of their teas, that seem homemade and like real tea.   All the waiters that we got were all respectful and did everything with speed. We got seated right away and our drinks were ordered and ready in no time. The food took a while since there were four different orders. But there was always a waiter coming back to check on us and filling our drinks back up. I never went with an empty drink. Our waiters weren't there 24/7, which was nice since they gave us time to talk and enjoy the southern environment. The warm towels at the end to wash our hands and face is definitely a great add, never seen that at any other restaurant.   The whole aura of the place is a southern BBQ home, which is exactly what I saw. The tables and the chairs weren't anything fancy, but where comfortable and definitely looked like a family table.  The whole aura went along with the food and the drinks. It all fit together like a picture film.",

I've never been disappointed with taste. Portions a sizable for food as well.

I was expecting to wait 30 to 40 minutes so having to wait 55 minutes wasn't really an issue for me. However it did allow me to witness an employee picking cigarette butts out of an ashtray with his bare hands.  I'm sure he washed hands when he went inside but he had to open the door with his bare hands and god knows what else he touched between the door and the faucet.  Once we were finally seated our server disappeared for 15 minutes and I had to flag down someone different in order to place a drink order.  When our server finally arrived we placed an order for an appetizer. It was delivered by a third person who threw the plate on our table and it slid across almost to the wall she announced fried green tomatoes and walked away.  No Silverware, no napkins so I got up and hunted down our server asked for some to be brought over so we could eat our tomatoes.  Was told sorry we ran out. How does a properly managed restaurant run out of Silverware? (It doesn't) the Server sent someone over with some silverware but it was given to the booth behind us who didn't have any food on their table!   So we have been there more than an hour an a half didn't have silverware and we didn't have drinks.  Once our silverware arrived the tomatoes were a little bland but the sauce made up for the lack of flavor in them.   When We finally got around to place an order I asked for an extra corn bread muffin and a side of Mac and Cheese these are both on the of side order menu and  should not have been too difficult but I had to ask twice for them to get delivered so I could eat them with my meal.  The manager did come over and apologized for our experience and offered to take some of the items off our bill but when the bill arrived everything was still on it.  I considered calling him over and pointing that out but figured it would be easier just to pay for everything and call it a night.  It may just be another 8 months till I come back for that delicious Blacken Catfish but I will be back eventually once the memory of last night fades away.",

I did grow up in California...where Santa Maria style seasoning and tri-tip was perfected...so maybe I expected too much from Lucille's?  It's got a blues meets barn flare. They have a happy hour from 3-7 during the week. I would recommend beer: Lucille's beer was surprisingly good! We (three of us) tried the amber, hef and one of the other Lucile's beers all very good. $4.5 for 22oz beer is pretty cheap.  Food: the rolls and apple butter are by far the best thing on there!!! The spinach dip is good, not great; brisket sliders not so good; pickle spears ok; rib tips pretty good.   Service was nice and helpful. Maybe a little over sat...but she did well.  Probably wouldnt recommend this to any of my friends or family. Much better places out there.",

I would recommend the pork ribs over the beef.  The beef ribs are just massive and are a little tougher than the pork.  The appetizers are also top notch...wings, pickles, shrimp are all terrific.  I can't say for certain if they are a new addition, but the biscuits were amazing last time.  I don't recall them being as good in the past.  I have a feeling they might have switched things up, but whatever the case, beware of filling up on the biscuits.  If you aren't interested in having a quiet family experience I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  About a half dozen TVs to catch whatever game is on and in some cases there will be live music.  Last visit there was a jam band of shorts but they were actually pretty good, really brought in that southern vibe.  I also believe that the happy hour drink and food specials are only good in the bar area, so all the more reason to sit there.",

I prefer to eat outside. The vibe is more southern and it seems to just feel right. They are always packed so be prepared to wait for a bit...but trust me it is worth the wait.",

    "text": "What I had: Sweet Tea, Fried Pickles (appetizer), BBQ Sampler (entree) + 2 sides  Price: $40  Sweet Tea: GREAT, comes in a big Bass Mason Jar with actual fresh mint leaves in it. Most places don't go this far. Didn't even need a refill.  Fried Pickles: whole dill SPEARS fried. I honestly didn't like them as much because (1) The dills were too big. I prefer the little, oval shaped pickles (chips). (2) The fried outer shell falls off too easily. (3) They were incredibly hard to eat as they were to hard to pick up with a fork and too hot to touch with your hand. They were so hot, in fact, that when I bit into one, the juice came out and burned my tongue and lips. They weren't that great. the 2 dips (ranch, onion) was bland. \"Famous Dave's BBQ\" makes better fried pickles  BBQ Sampler: (1) Chicken: Juicy, no complaints (2) St. Louis Ribs: no complaints but I've had juicier ribs elsewhere that fall off the bone easily (3) Brisket: Good but it didn't have the TANGY taste of \"T.C.'s Rib Crib\" or the softness with extra BBQ of \"Famous Dave's BBQ\". the best part of Lucille's is the fact that they ACTUALLY grill all their food on an open flame and you can't hide that look, taste or feel. Most other places BAKE their so-called BBQ food. Their is a great deal of food, anough to feed 2, but I don't think it warrants a $30 price tag.  Mac-n-cheese (1 of 2 appetizers): Supposedly \"homemade\", it's GOOD but not great or not anything to write home about. \"T.C.'s Rib Crib\" has their own recipe and it's much better and \"Famous Dave's BBQ\" has a more \"zazzier\" mac.  Peanut Coleslaw: SUKT. it wasn't creamy at all. It tasted more like a cold salad with chopped peanuts on top. Greev Valley Ranch Feast Buffet has the best coleslaw.  (Freebie appetizer) Bread biscuit with honey/cinnamon/butter: Soft but dry. Their's doesn't compare to the taste of Memphis BBQs.  The Decor: this is where they shine. Their restaurant has a much more thematic southern feel than all others. The outside resembles the front porch of an old southern home while the 2 inside portions look like a Jazz/Blues Bar and a Southern restaurant on a sun deck  The waitresses/waiters: When I first walked in 2 waitresses CLEARLY saw me standing right in front of them right at the entrance which is shouldered on the left by the bar. Yet they acted like I was invisible. One of the ladies had a kid who (for some reason) was hanging out in the bar area!?!? The kid ran past me and jumped into his waitress mommy's arms as she CONTINUED to ignore me. I finally just walked past them and SAT MYSELF. Although I was sitting there with no FOOD menu, about 5 waiters walked past me, glancing at me but never stopping to take my order (not even my drink order) for a period of about 5 mins. the waitress that DID approach me was nice however (white or hipanic or mixed chick) short black ponytail. I thought the FIRST thing you do when a customer walks in is to seat them and hand them a menu??? Apparently they don't do that here.  Final Verdict: If you want better tasting \"Southern Style\" or \"Soul\" Food for a cheaper price try Famous Dave's, T.C.'s Rib Crib, or Memphis BBQ.",

Sampler appetizer was awesome though. Fried pickles, okra, sweet potato fries, BBQ pork. They also serve their own beer.

I ask for a manager a lady came by and saying sorry for the wrong order. She also said she won't charge me for the ribs I said that's not right. I told her I will pay the rest of my order and don't worry bringing me the ribs. I was already claiming down, until the waitress waited for the manager to leave and approach me and my family, she told me I did order the Brisket and my wife said it too. Not True at all plus my wife never said a thing. That fired me up and I was very upset with the waitress. I felt this waitress thinks I'm cheap and a lair. Screw you lady!!! I'm sorry you ruin my family dinner and I put in my profession 12 to 15 hours a day!!! Thanks a lot!!! The only thing clam me down is the lady manager. I will close on this, I did pay my drinks and also donated $10.00 plus the bill at $7.58 equal $17.58. I'm not cheap and I do tip good to people that care for customer service!!! I treat my customer with respect and truthful. I will not mention the lady's name, she knows. The positive thing is the band was playing there is awesome!!! Listen the food is good there and I will continue my business with the restaurant but somewhere else. Sorry but I don't like being treated like a lair plus cheap!!! Have a nice night. The lady manager was trying her best to make happy. Thank you for that, but I told you, I don't like be treated like crap. Sorry for this review but it needs to be said.   Thank you  Jayson Wells",

    "text": "The food was DEE-licious! I had the baby-back-rib appetizer and if this is an appetizer, I cannot imagine what a meal would be like. This was like 7 decent sized and really yummy ribs! If I stopped right there, this would be a five-star review, BUT   the service is unbelievably slow! Party of 8, we arrived at 12:30, seated right away and then waited ... waited ... Server finally appeared. A lovely, cheerful young woman. Took our drink order and then we waited ... waited ... About 10 minutes later she came back with the waters & iced teas, but the beer drinkers had to wait ... wait...   Someone finally served the beers and a few minutes after that, our waitress came back to take our order. I asked about separate checks. She said their policy was not on large parties, but she'd go check with the manager. I told her no, fearing we'd have to wait some more. She took our order -- we had now been there about 45 minutes. She asked if we would like biscuits. Yes! Anything!   A few minutes later, someone brought us biscuits and my side order of a small green salad which was actually quite large and yummy. (At that point cardboard would have tasted yummy!) Finally, well over an hour after we were seated, our orders began to arrive. All but one. We all waited (again!) politely for the 8th order to arrive. For some reason, it was held up. The rest of us finally thew aside manners and began eating. Half way through our meal, her food was served.   The quality of the food was excellent. I thought the prices were are a bit over-the-top. My \"appetizer\" was $15.99, but as I said it was good and combined with the side salad ($2.99) and a roll, it was plenty -- I took some home for dinner.   I would say that if you are in a relaxed mood and not all that anxious to get your food, this would work well. I do not recommend it for large parties since we then had to spend another 10 minutes breaking down the bill, who-had-what, how much of a tip (I thought the guys were very generous considering the slow service), etc. Thank goodness we all had cash -- not everyone does these days.   The whole thing was two hours from seating to finishing. Waaayy too long.   Oh, one other thing -- they crammed us into two small tables shoved together. We were elbow to elbow which was not necessary because there were several empty tables around us. I would not recommend this for a large group.",

Fried okra is my favorite and you can only find it a few places in town.   Service is pretty good.

First, the happy hour goes until 7pm, which is awesomely late for a happy hour, and then it continues again at 9pm. Appetizers are between $4-6 and are basically small plates--delicious and filling, and not just frozen mozzarella sticks thrown in the fryer. Quite a lot of drink specials as well--beers and specialty cocktails both on the happy hour list.  A couple of times I have had Tobi for a server and she is amazing! Genuinely happy to be there, and not the trolling-for-tips kind of \"happy to be there.\" Parking is always great, right behind the restaurant.

We remember in the past being brought a basket of (4) biscuits, without us asking for them.   On finishing my peach tea, I was asked by my waitress if I wanted a refill. I said, \"Yes,please\". She never returned with the tea. Three  other workers passed  by my table  and asked me,\"Would you care for another tea?\" Again, \"I said, \"Yes\". And again, NO ONE brought me a tea. A manager walked by my table to ask \"How's everything?\" I told her she was the 5th person who asked if I would like a tea refill and I still am waiting for the tea. She said she would take care of it. Still no tea! My waitress walked to our table, again asking if I would like a refill. I told her she was now #6 of people asking me, but still no tea. She said she would take care of it. She didn't. Then a blonde manager came to me and I told her, \"You are now the 7th person to ask me if I need a refill\". This manager spoke to the waitress and I FINALLY was given a refill of tea.   I live in Green Valley and frequent many of the shops and restaurants there on a weekly basis. My husband and I are still annoyed at the poor service at Lucille's. I might also add that the carpet looked shabby. My husband told me that the ribs were not as tender as they used to be. My pulled pork sandwich was tender and tasty. The corn on the cob tasted mealy. For a restaurant in The District, it has become a Big Disappointment to me. I will not eat there again.",

Don't worry, not very spicy...just has a lot more flavor than their default bbq sauce IMO.  The ribs earned a 4.5/5 in my book.    The sides were not mind blowing...ordered the mac and cheese and the corn.  Didn't really hit it outta the park.  Would not order them again...The comp bread was good though!  The strawberry lemonade was super yum!  Also ordered the gumbo...it was pretty bland to tell you the truth.  Gumbo is supposed to be an explosion of spices and a little bit of heat, but this didn't do much for me at all.  Knocked off the extra star due to this...  The service was good and attentive, but the prices are pretty steep IMO.  I think my rack was $30.  Most of the other choices were in the high 20 range as well.  Good BBQ deserves good $$$, but I feel like everything was 10-20% higher than they should be.  I might be back, just won't be running back soon.",

The tips were a bit dry, but the smoke was just right. We ordered the BBQ egg rolls as well, which were amazing. Though Lucille's was not a reference to BB Kings guitar, I would certainly go back. Everyone I ate with (party of 6), enjoyed their meals.",

    "text": "So this is a two part review...  Part 1 - It's 115 degrees outside. It's a Tuesday. A group of us are trying to stop in for a quick bite to eat and to make it to GVR for $6 Tuesday Movies. So we chose Lucille's because a friend in the group had never eaten there and he wanted to try it. It was pretty steady for a Tuesday so we chose to sit in the bar. Reminder, hell's doors must have been left open because it was at least 127 degrees outside. So we're hoping to get in somewhere cool, enjoy a quickish meal, and go to the movie. As we take our seat in the bar we realize it's not cooling down. We get our drinks, they had more sweat coming off them than an Olympic weight lifter. Again, it's at least 134 degrees outside. So we order our food, definitely decent quality. Never had tried the burger so I got that. Also tried Fried Green Tomatos for the first time. Not too shabby. We tell the waitress that we need the bill because we're in a hurry to get out of there so we can make it to the movie. 10 minutes later she brings the bill. So I was already hot, since it was 140 degrees outside, this just made me hotter. Fortunately we made the movie before the start, but had to sit in the 3rd row (lame sauce).   Intermission - so I wrote a letter on the Lucille's website just letting them know my disappointment in the service and the setting. I received a phone call from the restaurant manager and was told that because of their smokers they use when it gets above 110 outside they have a challenge keeping the venue cool. I appreciated the call and accepted the apology. Not very often you get an actual person to call you. Definitely won me over as I know this wasn't the \"norm\" for Lucille's. To my delight, a week later I also received a $25 gift card in the mail. Thank you Lucille's.  Part 2 - A perfect meal. This time it was only 104 outside (only, haha). I ordered my personal favorite, the Marinated Sirloin Steak Sandwich, and it was outstanding as always. Steak cooked to perfection. My wife ordered a bowl of clam chowder which she said was absolutely delicious. I'd be remiss to not mention the sweet tea, which I think I may have drank a gallon of. Best sweet tea around. Service was great, and the temperature was much more comfortable this time around.  Thank you Lucille's for turning a bad experience into a good one. We'll be back.",

The beef is not grass-fed, but the pork is pretty darn delicious. Despite the food being laden with artificial ingredients and preservatives, the meat itself when taken alone is pretty darn tasty.  The portions are huge and a pretty good value.  The drinks are delicious and I ignore all the sugar and whatnot in them. It's booze. It isn't supposed to be healthy to begin with.  I order all my meats \"dry\" --meaning no sauce added --and eat them the way they were supposed to be. Meaty and delicious.",

Unfortunately,  dry was the answer I received. The chopped brisket could have been from yesterday as it was none too moist. The bun was nicely toasted and the \"mop sauce\" was pretty tasty. I chose Mac and cheese as my side and it was quite good.  I am in Las Vegas for one more day and as I am not yet willing to give up on this place, will probably give it one more try.

    "text": "Happy Hour: 3-7pm, excluding holidays.  Their HH is one of the best I've been to in the Valley with a menu that's extensive. Even if they're smaller portions than the regular plate, they've now become normal, human-sized portions -- enough for two people. Their food plates range from $2-8. Their drinks (cocktails and beer) range from $4-7.   I had their gumbo, onion straws, fried pickles, rip tips, and Crocodile Cooler. The cocktail had five different kinds of rum in it and boy, does it ever. You don't taste the alcohol and it actually tastes very refreshing. I'd definitely recommend it for a good time.   Their onion straws and fried pickles are typical fried fare. I can probably live off their gumbo and rip tips for the rest of my life. The gumbo came in a reasonable small bowl with a heaping of rice. The rip tips were enough for two people, about half a pound.   I've come several times to their HH, left happy and satisfied each time. However, I just came on July 4th (craving me some BBQ) but they stated they didn't do HH on holidays, although the HH menus were out. I should have expected they may not do HH on major holidays but don't keep me in suspense, let me salivate, and try to order -- only to be told abruptly that you don't do HH on holidays. Take away the HH menus then!   Overall, great space for HH, lots of seating (get there 3-5pm) and great service. (Most of the time)",

    "text": "It's graduation season and we were starving after a long ceremony. I was smart enough to call ahead and ask about the wait and figured by the time we get there our table would be ready. Sure enough it was. They also took down my number and sent me cute little texts telling me my table was being prepared or ready. That's something that probably comes in handy for those who are around shopping in the district.   All I wanted were ribs!!! I optd for a salad because I'm trying to be a good girl. The service staff was good, just good and slow. Everything seemed to be taking for-ev-ver! It gill could just be because we wanted gourmet food at microwave speed, but at the end of the night, a cup of tea took just as long. Which brings me to the fact that the air was on full blast and completely unbearable. I'm use to being s little colder indoors, but I had goosebumps and chills. I thought the warm towel at the end of our meal was a means to bring up my body temperature.   I had the salmon salad and it was grilled perfectly. I didn't read the ingredients too well because nasty tomatoes and cucumbers made their debut onto my plate. The capers were extremely salty too. I basically ate salmon, greens and onions. I left all that extra stuff in the plate.   Ok, so I wasn't as good of a girl as I could've been, but I swear I only had 3 baby back ribs! Lol. Can't come here without eating bbq! No complaints there!  The guest of honor ordered a steak medium and not only did he receive his plate well after everyone else, it was also well done. So the fired up another steak and we waited in the Arctic Circle longer, but they comped the steak so all is well with that.  I'll definitely remember to bring a sweater or just demand to be sat outside next time.",

We called to let them know and they ask \"do you wanna come back so we cam give to you?\" First of all we would have just dined there if you want us to come back. Why would you make us drive back, when its your fault for not double checking what we ordered. We tried calling for a couple days. We cant even get a hold of a manager. I work in F & B as well and what you guys did to us wouldn't fly with me. Worse customer service I've seen. And then someone tell us her name is Nicole, that they just comped our meal and its gonna go back to our card. Well its been a week and we hvnt gotten our money back. Food is Great. But i cant say the same for Management. Gonna give our Business to someone else who takes customer complaints seriously.",

They get an extra bump because they are close to home, they have convenient parking, and the food isn't overly pricey. At dinner time they can get really busy, but worth the wait if BBQ is your thing.  At this point I've had most of the items on the menu. My personal favorites are the baby back ribs, Mardi Gras chicken, and Big Easy BBQ shrimp. They have a wide variety of items on the menu so it'd be a good place for a group with a variety of tastes.   Service is good for the most part, but can be slow at random times.",

    "text": "To update: after posting my review a year ago I was messaged by the restaurant regarding my review, they gave an apology for the experience and had sent me a comp card to give them a try again. I'll be honest I had no desire to ever return to this restaurant I was still fuming about the incident. I got talked into going here for my birthday dinner so I went on 11/18/17. We made a reservation because it is always busy. We were given Art as a waiter and I will say he was a very good serve and we also spoke with Kyla (sorry if I botch the name) she was very nice too. The food this time was excellent, service was on point, experience was much better than before. If you would've asked me prior to yesterday about this restaurant I'd have nothing nice to say, I'm glad I gave it another try and that they actually valued my review and reached out to me. Most business don't seem to care much about customers anymore so that says a lot to me! Kudos to you guys and thanks for a great experience and some good food. My view has now changed and I wanted to make sure that reflected in my yelp review!  Last night 12/17/16 i took my employees to this restaurant for our Christmas Dinner. I made the reservation over a month prior. When we arrived we had to stand around and wait for the tables.... but I made a reservation? Yet I'm waiting around like a walk in so I guess reservations don't really matter?!? Then we finally get sorted where they put us was a joke. We had to sit at a table squished against a wall and another large group of people, half my staff were very uncomfortable the other side couldn't move an inch or they'd hit the group behind them. Then the service was slowwwww took forever just to start off with drinks. Now let's get to the food oh my goodness holy lighter fluid taste. Horrible taste light charcoal and lighter fluid, it was dry as a bone hardly any BBQ sauce and the sauce is nothing special.  The two meat combo we ordered that was 23.99 with ribs the bone was huge so you expect meat wow there was two bites of meat on the bone and that's it. The tri tip sandwich taste like I licked a BBQ. I could've gone to Arby's and had better tasting food for a quarter of the cost. I spent $400 on this place and I'm still pissed I feel ripped off like I just got mugged by this restaurant. What a miserable experience for my first time ever here I would NEVER return. At my company we post our experiences at local places well this place will take the leader board for crappiest place to eat. Food is horrible there were 10 of us in the party and we all agreed it taste horrible so it's not just me. Service is slow, very very slow! Over an hour to get food is crazy, 35 mins just to get water flipping insane! Buyer beware overpriced food for poor quality if you want ribs buy loyds ribs at Albertsons and save yourself some money and frustration of $23 on ribs with no meat and leave feeling like you licked the BBQ in your backyard. Shame on you Lucile's!!",

    "text": "Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que was a blast!  This is the kind of restaurant you go to with family or close friends, roll up your sleeves and eat with your hands.  The restaurant has a playful, laid back feel; the servers are friendly; and the portions are generous.  Four of us shared a Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs and a Full Rack of St. Louis Ribs with extra sides--just a few dollars more for each.  We left stuffed and very satisfied.  The ribs were pull-of-the-bone-tender, flavorful, and not dripping with sauce--which we liked.  There are 3 bottles of Lucille's BBQ Sauce on the table ranging from spicy to sweet for you to add more sauce if that's your thing.  Memorable add-ons/sides were the Caesar Salad, Mac 'n Cheese, and Mashed Potatoes, I would skip the Coleslaw (undressed) and Baked Beans (too sweet, lots of sauce, not a lot of beans), and don't fill-up on the House Biscuits (heavy and dense).  There are plenty of options on the fairly large menu, including pasta, sandwiches, jambalaya, and salad, if someone in your group doesn't like BBQ, but when the restaurant is called Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que, you can guess what your best bet is going to be.  If you're not going to grill at home, come down to Lucille's and let them do the work for you.",

    "text": "After about a 2 year hiatus, my love affair with Lucille's is back in full swing. It's one of those places that you go to like crazy and then forget about its existence for a while but once you return, you end up frequenting the join 4 times a month! That has happened to me and I am currently having an on-again romance with their tasty wood-smoked barbecue!  The menu here is extensive and expensive. The best money saving tip I have is to order stuff off the appetizer menu and share. My husband loves burnt ends so he usually orders the appetizer plate of them and I get a bbq chicken sandwich. We get some other appetizer or side to share and it works out great. Plenty of food and our check is under $40 (a bargain for Lucille's, a place where combo plates run about $25-$30 per person). Be aware of the high prices so you can avoid sticker shock.   At least the expense is worth it! The food is fresh and tasty and the barbecued meats are fresh-smoked all day long (as made evident by the smoky smell as soon as you walk in the front door). There are several sauces on the table so mix it up and try them all! I love the cheese grits and Southern braised greens as sides; both are reasonably authentic enough to help make my raised-in-the-Carolinas belly happy.   The complimentary biscuit basket is something I easily skip -- the biscuits are good but they are topped with sugar. I'm more of a traditional biscuit girl (but the sweet cinnamon butter on the side is delicious). But don't worry if you are watching your sugar intake: one of the best-kept secrets on the menu is their fruit-infused UNSWEETENED iced tea. You can get delicious brewed regular tea or their ZERO SUGAR fruit infused peach or watermelon iced tea! The peach is delicious. All come with free refills so drink up (always ask for a free to-go cup after your meal and you'll get a giant treat to take away)!  The atmosphere is cool and fun and there are different themed dining rooms. I love sitting on the (fully indoor) back porch. The bar has particularly cute decor so be sure to pop your head in to sneak a peek.   Parking can be difficult on the weekend but if it's too crazy, just park next door in the Green Valley Ranch casino parking garage and walk over. Another negative is that the service can be hit or miss. I've had more misses than hits at this place, but I still love it.",

Subsequently, I was notified by my bank that there were several charges that were unauthorized! While it was at Lucille's the last time the card was used and while my account was cleared of the charges, I can't and will nor officially say the card was abused by an employee there. But.... I cannot see myself going there again. I guess I'd rather err on the side of caution. Caveat Emptor! ron",

For appetizers we had the baby back ribs and fried green tomatoes which sat in a red sauce I didn't care for. The ribs were too sweet and jerky-like for me but happy was happy. The saving grace and high star rating was for the Best Chocolate Cake Ever which is a great name for it because it was! Big enough for 3 people to share.   Service: I had to ask for refills and ketchup which was fine but I'd prefer they anticipate needs more.   Location: conveniently located in The District and easy parking.   I'd go again and order something else to eat, but definitely get the chocolate cake again. Or just come for dessert!",

I have special dietary needs and they waited until our order was ready to be served to tell me there were going to charge me $25 for two hamburger patties, no bun no sides just two patties. I ended up cancelling my meal. Then I complained to the manager and she said she would talk to the servers and train on menu things, something like that. After that the service got worse. The server never came back to clean off the dirty dishes and we literally had to beg someone to bring us a bill. Manager comes over and I tell her again what's going on, so she tells me I am ruining her night and hurting her feelings because I am complaining in the middle of the restaurant. I asked her to do something with the bill, again she tells me how much I have hurt her feelings and ruined her night. She runs my card but refuses to let me sign the receipt. I ask her to let me sign it and she crumbles it up and says no!!  I have no clue what she charged me and no telling what will show up in my account!! The worst hadling of a complaint by a manager ever! Epic fail on managemts part!",

    "text": "My review is based on this location being involved with our event through Lucille's catering.  First off, Lucille's catering department was fantastic. The main person I spoke to was Tenaya, who was pleasant and wonderful at giving me quick and accurate information about their catering services. She helped me put together a menu in about 10 minutes, sent me a quote within minutes of us speaking, and revised the quote for us three times, with nothing but a great attitude. She made the selection and payment process effortless.  On the day of the event, two servers from this location (the Henderson Lucille's) were at our warehouse right on time. The two assigned to serve for us were Nicole and Katrina. I made sure to get there names, due to the reasons I will go into... These ladies were friendly, polite/respectful, attentive, and even had additional supplies that I hadn't thought about for the event. These were pretty critical tools I needed to have that I was scrambling to find. Between the two of them, they literally pulled the tools from their bags to help out.  The food was fresh, delicious, and typical of my past experiences with Lucille's.  Not only will I use Lucille's again for catering, I will literally ask for these two servers back. A+ Lucille's- you guys rock!",

Wife had the ribs and I had the BBQ chicken.  Both great and they have different BBQ sauces to try.  The garlic mash potatoes were so good! Yum. Will definitely go back!  Oh Also, since your eating BBQ, your going to get your hands messy.  They give you wet, warm wash clothes for your hands and mouth.  Never had that before and its a great idea!

(mmm buttermilk bisquits!) very soft, fluffy, and warm as soon as he sat them down on the table. they also come with apple butter. putting a bisquit onto my plate and to my surprise they are topped with sugar. let me state that i am head over heels for dessert at all hours of the day, but i just didn't care for sugared buttermilk bisquits and apple butter. i wish they left them plain. :( pout. onto the fried pickles. i love me some southern fried pickles just not as sticks. (refer to picture.) i have never had them in the shape of a fried stick but i was let down. the fried coating was falling off and it was very messy. (not to mention greasy.) they were okay, but not something i will crave. i go for the gumbo for the main course. i have had some good gumbo in my day and maybe that led me to be spoiled. it was spicy. i liked the sausage in it, but they didn't chop up the chicken. i had a whole chunk of chicken in my gumbo soup and a whole lotta rice. the flavoring was good and like i said spicy. even made my nose run! i sort have wish i went for something else though. apparently everyone else in my party loved their meals including the ribs and chicken. someone else had the fried shrimp and really liked it. the servers were really nice and attentive. i feel i should give it another try if everyone else liked their meals so i will give it 3 stars for that and the lovely service we had. i hope other people have better luck then i did.",

The food was AMAZING. the various meats we ordered (i would name them all but we ordered so much that I can't remember them!) were really really great, very tender and succulent. The various sides we ordered (mac and cheese, corn, garlic mashed potatoes, and shoestring fries) were delicious. Of course the apple butter, which was served prior to our meal with biscuits, was tasty as always. They changed their biscuits since the last time I was here, not too crazy about the new ones. Our drinks, which were served in mason jars, were never empty, and we even got to take them to go (in a plastic cup, we of course couldn't take the mason jars home). Overall experience was GREAT! If I could give 10/5 stars I would.",

Walked off and our server Christine assisted us - she was neither helpful or cheerful. We had our food, it was ok compared to the charleston location. Me and my brother asked for some alcoholic drinks and my dad a soda. Me and my brother finished our drinks and sat for almost 20-30 minutes waiting to be served another drink or to be acknowledged as Christine continued to walk by us - never did she stop by and refilled us. We were not done with our food and she brings the hot towels and YET no drinks. We sit for another 15 min before she comes and brings us boxes to go. Still no refills or nothing. Then another 15 minutes before we got our check. She deserved the 60 cents I left her - yet she has the ordasity to run out to the door and thank us for coming in as to make us feel bad for no tipping? We all just laughed.

As others have mentioned the service was very friendly and the portions are huge. I think most rib plates could be shared. I came once with my parents and my dad and I got 2 different kinds of ribs and mom got chicken. Everything was really good and portions were incredible. Had to take a bit home.   I've noticed it can get a bit crowded in the evenings especially as temps warm up as they have wonderful patio seating. It never seems to be a place for a quiet evening as its always a little noisy. Its great food for the price though and I would definitely go there again and again.",

Not sure which city of Greenville Lucille grew up in (Wisconsin as stated by our server), but this place seems to try to grasp all styles of regional bbq....I had the \"Texas-style\" brisket and was truly disappointed.  I was recently in San Antonio and had True roadhouse bbq.  The first thing you experience is the smell of oak, hickory, mesquite in the air....not so much here, just fryer oil.  The meat had a good black crust and a nice pink smoke ring, but no smoke flavor.  As mentioned by others, it seems more like pot roast.  Tender yes, but Texas-style brisket, it is not.    Beyond that the food was not hot upon arriving at the table...not sure how they pickup each order, but perhaps they need to rethink that process.   Thats it.  Next time I go to bbq, unfortunately Lucille's will not be on my list.",

I've been wanting to try this place for a while but we rarely get out this way as its all the way in Green Valley and we live in N.

Once we got in, our order came up pretty fast and lemme tell ya, it was worth the wait. I had the pulled pork, greens and macaroni.....Delish!!! Hubby had bbq shrimp which he loved and the kids also enjoyed their ribs & chicken. I also had a peach margarita which is the best I've had since...well ever! nly thing I didnt care for were the biscuits they bring out before dinner. They had sugar on top of them I think. Had a really weird taste and was very crumbly. I should've just asked for cornbread I guess....Oh well. Given the fact that we only had about 5 min to eat becuase our 1 yr old decided he wanted to be back outside, it was definetly worth it. I will most definetly be making a trip back out her soon!",

    "text": "this is seriously good bbq, very homey, incredibly reasonable, and a huge menu to boot.  the waiting area is like your grandmother's livingroom, and the service is both fast and folksy.  we took a $60+ RT cabride from vegas, but it was so worth it.  the backporch plate of tri-tip, 1/2 chicken, and baby back ribs was so good it made my eyes roll up in my head, honey.  it came w/fabulous, tender biscuits, and a choice of 2 sides from a dizzyingly big list.  we chose well w/peanut slaw, and the potato salad, both of which I highly recommend.   my only complaint, and it's a small but significant one, is the fried green tomatoes--they were swimming in some kind of creamy tomato sauce, which muddied up the fried goodness of the tomatoes.  I would have preferred a remoulade or tartar sauce, a la new orleans.  other than that, it was like going to heaven w/o dying.    I think I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you won't get anything like this on the strip.  it's a huge relief to get away from the surf n' turf or high end, foofy places that fatigue both the wallet as well as the palate.  even w/the cabride, we saved money, and, even sharing the backporch special, we had enough leftovers, along w/the extra biscuits they gave us, that I had cold bbq chicken on biscuits for the next 3 days.  you can smell the meat cooking from about 1/2 mile away and it's popular, so make reservations, if you can.  it has an outdoor porch that looked great for nice days, but the place gets filled up fast, they tell me.  we got lucky or maybe just ate early, so there was no wait.  also, lucille's is in a shopping center, totally unassuming, but I can't wait to return on our next trip to vegas to try something else on the intimidatingly big menu.  I recommend this place, hands down--it's worth the taxi ride/ drive.  seriously.",

My baby back ribs were tender and had lots of flavor - rack is about 25 bucks so they should be good, although you do get 2 sides.  The Poor Boy sandwich had really nice fried shrimp, very light coating and not greasy at all.  The basket of bisuits is a great bonus.",

    "text": "Lucilles is really great BBQ, definitely the best in Vegas by far. They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food.",

    "text": "I Finally had a chance to check out what all the fuss is about. Everyone has always told me that Lucille's has some of the best in town. Not that I wouldn't want to believe this, but I have had plenty of disappointments as of late. However this is not one of those. First of all, they have an incredible location in the District at Green Valley Ranch (an outdoor mall of sorts). What can I say, great environment, but the porch area is extremely loud and I had to notably raise my voice (which is not quiet to begin with) when talking to my server. Loved the fact that the water was served in standard Mason Jars (without handles). As usual we combined a couple of sampler platters so as to experience as much variety as possible. Ribs and chicken were right on. White meat was perfectly done. Chicken naturally has a slight pinkish hue to it even when completely done. As long as the juices run clear it is fine. I think most people try to eliminate any sign of pink and turn it into chalk dust. The tri tip was incredibly tender and still juicy even though it was served well done, but the fact that it was automatically served well done is a definitely a minus. We added a Hot Link for only $2.95! It was excellent, slightly coarse in texture, good snap, possibly indicating a natural casing and it had well balanced heat. The sides were excellent as well. Potato salad that obviously used a generous amount of mustard and was not too sweet (a little viscous though). Greens, Beans and veggies were right on (not too salty). The pulled pork was only o.k.. It was a bit dry and it seemed like they tried to finish it like Carnitas under a broiler before serving. Also I felt that it was \"too shredded\" kind of like a thin meat pasta with no hearty chunk to it. The Brisket was the only thing that I will say was definitely not good. It had great flavor, but was totally dry and was sliced into jerky size pieces (big minus for that). I give 2 of the 3 sauces a big plus. The mustard bbq sauce was right on. The hot bbq sauce was excellent and actually hot. However the standard sauce that they serve on everything was way too sweet, sickeningly so. It might work out just as well as a desert sauce. Speaking of sweet, they have fantastic biscuits served with compound butter (cinnamon and apple), but they also may fare better as a desert course. Overall Lucille's is a little more expensive by comparison, although it was a lot of food. We spent $62 for 2 with tip and that included a $5 off coupon, but you are paying for the environment and service as well. I'd probably give it 3.75 out of 5 if that rating were available. Two thumbs up!",

While the quality of the meat and taste was not quite up to those standards, most Americans will find Lucille's meats to be above average to excellent. For me, I found the jambalaya more impressive. It is served in an heaping portion, and the spices were just right to make it a memorable meal. Avoid the Texas beef brisket, which was not juicy or tasty like Texas brisket should be. Fortunately or unfortunately, the food I liked best here was fried, and there was a lot of it. If that's what you're looking for, this is not a bad taste of the South.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - BBQ - They have 3 BBQ sauces. Original, spicy, and one mixed with a vinaigrette I think. The spread their original on all their meats by default (you can ask for the meats dry without sauce if you'd like). The original is my favorite, and is on the sweeter sides of most sauces.        - Beef Ribs - Giant ribs with a lot of meat.        - Baby Back Ribs - The waiter told us these were the most tender and has less meat than the St. Louis. However, we found that they were slightly drier.        - St. Louis Ribs - Meatier and the most tender, this was my favorite rib hands down. The meat on the sides were a little chewy, but the meat in the middle was perfect.        - Consistency - We were told depending who finished off the ribs, some might be more tender than others. Of the ribs we got, the best ones were a step beyond most rib places. However, the drier parts were on par with cheaper BBQ places.        - Smoker - They have their own smoker in the middle of the restaurant. I thought this was a nice addition to the whole authentic feel of the place.        - Live band - We came at 7:30pm on a Friday and was greeted to a 45 minute wait and a live band (2 guys).        - Portion size - The food we got for was definitely too much. The 2 meat combo and the appetizer rib alone would feed 2 people easily. On a side note, the sides are kinda small compared to the meats. **Ordered**        - Biscuts and Apple Butter - They bring this to you at the beginning and it is freakin' awesome. The butter is made with butter, cinnamon and apple sauce. It goes perfectly with the fluffy biscut that already has sugar sprinkled on top.        - $3.99 Southern Fried Dill Pickles (Half) - They were pretty good. Lightly breaded and crisp. But since they were spears the breading always came off them too easily after the first bite.        - $13.49 Lucille's Chicken Salad - The first time I've had chicken salad where the chicken wasn't dry. It was really good. However, I didn't like the balsamic vinaigrette, so I got it dry. I added some of their BBQ sauce as dressing, and that was delicious.        - $27.99 BBQ 2 Meat Combo Platter - We got baby back ribs and beef ribs. The plate is giant. 4 large beef ribs and half a rack of baby backs. Their BBQ sauce is perfect, sweet but not too sweet.        - $13.99 BBQ Rib Appetizer - Got the St. Louis on this one and the meat near the bone was super tender and succulent. However, on one side of the rack and on the crust, it got a little dry. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a really nice BBQ place, and don't mind spending a bit. Though their prices are a little higher than most, you're paying for the quality.",

    "text": "So maybe I've been spoiled growing up with good BBQ as well as traveling to the BBQ meccas like Memphis, Texas, and the Carolinas, but I was not very impressed with this place.  I went tonight with my parents, as it was their last night in town and Yelp said this place was supposed to be good.  Service was fine, right up until they got my parents order wrong.  It took so long to remake their order that we ended up canceling it because I had already finished eating by that point, that's how long it took.  Can someone explain to me why it takes so long to make dry ribs and \"dry\" pulled pork?!  It was ridiculous.  Now on to the food we actually did get to eat.  The chicken wings were probably the best part of the dinner, we got them dry, and they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, excellently done.  The rib tips were ok, nothing special, but it was nice that they weren't to fatty.  The brisket was so smoked that there was barely any beef flavor there, mainly just smoke and bbq sauce, which made me wonder... The hot links were pleasantly spicy, but for some reason the casing didn't have much \"snap\" to it.  I had trouble piercing it with my fork.  I did like the sweet tea that I had, it was served with mint which was nice and went well.  Also like that they served the tea in a mason jar.  On the whole, I would give the food 2 stars, but due to the service and everything else, 1 star or less.  I will not be coming back to eat here unless dragged.",

A whole 13 minutes later we were being seated. Drinks came quickly, the Pulled Pork Queso Dip was great, and so were the biscuits. Ugh, the butter... Anyway, I ordered the Half Chicken & Two Meats, my boyfriend ordered the Brisket Burger. About 10 minutes later we get a half chicken and a plate of just brisket. Our server came back to check on us and we let him know we didn't get what we ordered. He wasn't very apologetic, quickly rushed through taking our orders again, and took the plates back. We weren't rude or angry, just wanted what we ordered. A few minutes later a manager came by with our correct meals and gave us a sincere apology. She offered to bring us more biscuits too... we gladly accepted. Our meals were delicious as always, our server checked on us a few times and eventually apologized. Toward the end of our meal another manager came by to apologize again and thanked us for our patience. He even surprised us by comping our entire meal. Overall we weren't happy with the way the server handled the situation but it was a pretty busy night and maybe he was having an off night. Management definitely saved the day with us and we'll be back again soon.",

Great atmosphere, friendly/helpful staff, delicious BBQ, big portions, some of the greatest food I've eaten at any restaurant. I ate the beef ribs. They were perfectly smoked and prepared. I didn't need to add any BBQ sauce, but I did anyway. I tried the original BBQ sitting on the table and loved it. I had the Mac and cheese and BBQ beans as my sides.  The Mac and cheese was so creamy and stingy. The mix of spicy Nd sweet in the BBQ beans added a great flavor to the side. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was perfectly breaded, well seasoned and the chicken was very juicy.  We are instant fans of Lucille's and are already plotting our next trip back.",

My 3 girls and I were int town for a soccer tournament and not all establishments welcomed kids in town.   This place was a refreshing find.   Sat on the deck without a reservation and Alfonso was our server.   Honestly the best server I've ever had in my life.   It was so nice to hVe someone nice to kids when everyone else had been so rude and insulting.   We were there for a soccer tournament.   Otherwise I would never bring my kids to Vegas.    He was fun and attentive without being annoying or too much.  He was great with my girls and their huge appetites.  Suggested kids meals which were so good they licked the plates (sliced beef and mac n cheese) My 13 year old and I split the baby back ribs and 2 sides.  OMG best I've ever tasted...little fat. The bisquits and butter were amazing.   Baked potato was amazing.   Chocolate cake was amazing.   My 13 year old also said \"they should do an undercover boss show here\" to get Alfonso a car or something.  It was that outstanding.     The best  \"bet\" we took in Vegas",

    "text": "Just left Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ in Henderson and let me say the food and service was seriously lacking.  We came for a \"late\" dinner around 8:30pm and all the servers either seemed too busy trying to clean for the restaurant closing (which wasn't until 10pm) or never returned with anything we asked for.  There were times where we asked two different servers about something we had ordered and neither remembered to bring it. Terrible!  Also we noticed after sitting there for a while and observing other patrons munching on biscuits, that our waiter didn't even bring us any and when we asked about it he didn't apologize or anything.  As far as the food goes, I've had meals at Jack in the Box and Wendy's with more flavor.  I ordered the the appetizer sampler and everything (minus the onion strings) was very bland and all our their sauces were a miss.  The three signature bbq sauces were not that good (one was waaaaay too sweet, the other was too peppery, and the third was tolerable).  I was also disappointed in the cuts of meat that I got too.  There was too much fat and not enough tender rib meat.  I'm not sure if they were having an off night here or what, but between the service (or lack thereof) that we received and the lack of even ONE good quality bbq sauce, I don't think I will be returning.  For bbq, I'm just going to stick with Famous Dave's.",

    "text": "HAPPY HOURS! Lucille's does not have one, but two a day. They begin from 4-7 and then 9 to close. Jack W. and I were lounging around looking for who has the best happy hour deals and the lounge within this restaurant had stood out amongst all the rest.   They have house well drinks $3.75, Jose Cuervo margaritas for the same price, Back porch strawberry lemonades are $5.25, Joe's Hurricane $4.75 (Mai Tai with Armaretto), crocodile coolers for $5.25 (Not sure what goes into this), and a mint julep $4.25 that they do not skimp on the alcohol. Just thinking about the Southern cocktail has me reeling in fear. The days of college binge drinking are over, so a few drinks from this place leaves you in a nice place.   Blame it on the economy or just the lack of new innovations, but the District has quieted down quite a bit. Going early in anticipation of the crowds that use to frequent this place left us speechless when we walked in and sat down right away. That's alright, just means more time to sit and enjoy ourselves.  Although we were planning on having another person join us, that did not stop us from going all out in our first order. With BBQ brisket sliders $3.99, wings $3.99, onion straws $2.99, and BBQ rib tips for $5.99 what's the harm in ordering them all with the intention of getting more when the other person joins. In hindsight, I can tell you what the problem with that is, but I do not regret our decision. Especially since the waitress was nice enough to bring us two orders of their famous biscuits and apple butter.   Round two called for the spinach dip, $3.99, which was a little too greasy for my taste. The Irish nachos, $1.99, an order of cheese fries with green onions and sour cream were better without the latter ingredient. We also got another order of the wings. For size of the wings alone, these were a better deal than Buffalo Wild Wings on wings Tuesday. You get six large wings that are fried crisp and tossed in your choice of Frank's red hot sauce, Memphis, original, or the spicy BBQ sauce.",

    "text": "Uhhhhhh no.  Look I see a lot of positive reviews here and that to me is severely troubling.  It's no secret that despite how good the food in Vegas can be, the BBQ segment of the town is sufficiently lacking.  This, in part, to me explains how reviews for a restaurant like this can be generally positive.  It's easy to think BBQ tastes good, it's meat and sauce and for some that's good enough. But if you've traveled across the country and seen what kind of BBQ is out there, you know this place isn't passable.  The key way to determine if a BBQ restaurant is good is if its food is really good without the need to even add BBQ sauce. That would mean the meat is cooked properly, seasoned properly. That's the whole ball game folks. This place doesn't pass that test.  -Appetizer Sampler. You can't say the negative review is due to a bad order when the sampler gives you 8 different items. Rip Tips-bland and tough. Sweet potato fries- bland. Tomatoes- bland. Egg rolls- I cant even remember these they must have been bad. Okra-bland. Chicken strips-bland. Hot Links- these were fine but it's sausage cmon they probably just shipped it in somewhere. And saved the worst for last, the fried dill pickles. I saw someone say the fried pickles were great and I literally slapped my forehead. These are whole pickle spears they have fried. Fried is the operative word because it's fried and not cooked.  One would expect the frying process to do both, but in a shocking twist when you fry something huge like a pickle spear for however short amount of time they did you will find a mediocre batter surrounding a rock hard pickle. It doesn't work and there's a reason why most fried pickles are made from dill chips...they are thinner, smaller, ergo they cook faster.  -Pulled Pork Sandwich. Pretty standard and pretty forgettable. Pork unseasoned. Their BBQ sauce is not enough to save this place it's a sauce that you would expect, truly nothing special.  If you need more reasons to not trust Vegas BBQ reviewers, Famous Dave's is rockin 3.5 stars. That place is straight up inedible. Just trust me, if you know what good BBQ is from Texas etc. you will know this is NOT it.  Skip!",

The service and lemonade was still top notch! :)  Our first time here and being that I'm from the South(MS), I say it was okay. More like an everyday chain restaurant to me. Everything was extremely sweet in my opinion - the braised greens needed vinegar, Coleslaw was okay, the potato salad had no flavor at all, baby back ribs were tender but could use a bit more flavor and the corn bread was very very sweet and tasted more like a pound cake than cornbread.   However, the strawberry lemonade was thebombdotcom and they give you hot towels after your dinner which is a .   Our waitress was Savannah and she was super sweet!",

We sat outside and it seems it's our luck that we always get seated by a big table. The server was nice obviously not his fault. We ordered a half order of the fried pickles. They were good nothing spectacular. As we were waiting it's always frustrating when another table sits down after you but gets their order before you? It's not like we ordered anything extravagant. 2 sandwiches and a kids grilled cheese. So after I addressed this with our waiter he stated it was the sausage sandwich I ordered that took a minute...ok give me a grill....whatever! To say the least the food was bland. I so wanted this experience to be better but it was not. So sad but probably will not be back.",

The potato salad was almost identical to my mother's. Had the perfect balance of celery, potato, onion. I'm a hugeee potato salad lover, & this totally did it for me. The mac & cheese as well was wow! Baked to cheesy perfected goodness just like I'm used to. Rib tips were a little fatty, which is the norm, but had plenty of meat on them & flavorful with the bbq sauce.& don't get me started on the apple butter biscuits!! Seriously couldn't stop eating, almost left my hubby with crumbs & gristle! Lol. WELL DONE Lucilles",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place forever, but I'm not sure why other than yelpers seem to love it and it is close to the house.  However, let me disclose that there is few BBQ restaurants I've been to that I really have loved, so you may not want to listen to me if Lucille's is your bag.  I hadn't eaten anything the day I went here, and a plate of filling BBQ sounded good to me.  I wanted to try a few things so I got a combo plate with baby back ribs and the beef ribs.  I knew it would be too much food but I figured I could take home what I didn't eat.  For sides, I had corn and cole slaw for a tiny bit of vegetables.  My husband and I tried the onion strings and he had the pulled pork.  I found the onion strings to lack any sort of discernible onion flavor, which is what I like in onion ring type dishes.  It was too much focus on breading, not enough on the sweet onion.  However, my husband, who isn't into onion rings, really loved this dish.  The main dishes were okay, nothing I haven't made at home much better.  The baby backs were not that tender, but I thought the flavor was good, and I love the vinegar based sauce they have.  They were disappointing a little, but compared to another restaurant in the area, like Memphis Championship BBQ, they were a lot better.  But the beef ribs were a big disappointment, as if they managed to burn them and make them kind of \"charred,\" but not in a good way.  I felt like I was just eating burned crunchy flesh and couldn't get through more than one rib.  My husband liked his pulled pork but it wasn't anything he hasn't had better before.  What really impressed us was they have some of their own \"Lucille's beers,\" that included a Hefeweizen, which was delicious!  While our dinner wasn't impressive, we would come back for this  and the wonderful unsweetened iced teas.  So we're more than excited to do Happy Hour here, but I'm not sure we'll come back for a normal dinner.",

    "text": "Yowza! Just the word I needed to describe Lucille's BBQ in the District.   I'm dined here on numerous occasions but since my very last experience was last night, here I am.   Checking in at the hostess stand was a breeze, I find there system for paging you when your table is ready effective, they take your cell phone number and text you when your seat is ready. Clever, yes, but I'm sure there are still folk out there acrewing charges on their wireless bill over waiting on a dinner table.   Anyway, let's get to it! Service is friendly, what you'd come to expect on a Friday evening in a hip-happenin joint such as the District, polite yet impersonal due to the volume of tables each server has in their stations.   Grilled artichoke with BBQ sauce..mmm! Extremely flavorful but it's a rare feet for Lucille's to ever cook the artichoke JUST right, it was a little on the tough side. It went down the hatch though, no problem.   Now, I know Lucille's is a BBQ place and when you think BBQ, you think big meaty ribs, pork, pork, chicken, meat, carbs and more pork but my most prized pick on this menu is actually their veggie burger!   I'm not kidding when I say I have day dreams of this veggie packed faux meat patty and it's accomplice's, the grilled onions, spring lettuce mix, garlic mayo and of course cheese.. If that doesn't fill you up, be sure to indulge on their tasty yet far from healthy side dishes.. collared greens, sweet potato fries, BBQ baked beans.. the list goes on.   So clear your dining calendar for a about a week and get ready for a fatty feast and a half. According to my more experimental friends, the catfish (blackened) was delish and the ribs were tender and cooked just right.   NOTE: Drop cloth and elastic waist band a MUST to eat here",

(barf)   I love that your water comes in a ball jar! Their biscuits with apple cinnamon butter is delicious!   My boyfriend and I shared the Half BBQ Chicken & Choice of two meats. We got the beef brisket and rib tips! It was a lot for one plate! It also came with a choice of two sides. We chose to get sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. They also had a choice of shoestring potatoes, veggies, corn, garlic mashed potatoes, etc.   The chicken was half a whole chicken. It was very moist and juicy! The beef brisket was sooo soft and melted in my mouth. I didn't even need to add extra bbq sauce to it. The rib tips were my least favorite, most pieces were fall off the bone, but some of them were kind of dry and not edible.  In the past, I've tried their family feast which comes with pratically everything on the bbq menu and appetizers. We shared the Super Feast with 6 people and we could barely finish it all. I love the fried okra and deep fried pickles! mm!  We went pretty early on a Thursday evening so it was quite empty and we were seated right away. The other times I've gone had been later in the evening on a weekend night and the place is pretty crazy packed! They have a nice gazebo area that you can wait in.. if there is room. Service here is usually very good but on a busy day can be quite slow.  The price, amount & quality of food is well worth it! And their mango margarita is pretty tasty.",

We were sat immediately up arrival despite the crowd waiting. What I was disappointed with was that, although I expected it to be busy, they crammed 3 large males and 2 females and a baby in a high chair onto a table that would normally seat 4 people. The highchair they provided was so dirty and had old food stuck to it, we had to scrub it down with baby wipes and used one of their cloth napkins to clean it off before I put my baby in it.  It was disgusting really.  It took awhile to get our drinks however once we ordered the food came out promptly.  We ordered the backyard feast. The menu says it feeds 4 however there was 6 of us and we still took home leftovers. The ribs were good and the mac n cheese was delicious. Garlic mashed potatoes were killer however the bbq beans were a little too sweet for my taste.  This huge feast however was just a reminder of how crammed we were on that table.  We barely had room for our drinks and plates, making it very uncomfortable to eat.  My suggestion would be to not accept so many reservations at one time and just crowd people in. Sacrificing customer service and comfortability for sales?!  I still gave it a 4 star because the food was great and service was good. We will go back again. We already said we will just pad 2 additional people on the reservation and just say they didnt show ;)",

    "text": "It's been a few years since we ate here last.  In Lucille's defense - I am not a huge restaurant BBQ fan - I much prefer the delicacies that the sexy hubby chef produces in our backyard.  However - this is the restaurant my son picked so we went.  There are really no complaints about the food really - it was neither Ohmygoodness awesome or Boythatreallysucks nastiness.  Food was warm and tasted good - just not memorable to me.  Sons got a rack of babybacks, tri tip and brisket - they all enjoyed them.  Since I am going to have backyard bbq deliciousness tonight - Hubby and I both went for the NY Strip - they were delicious - just not mind blowing to me.  Our dinners came with corn on the cob - didn't enjoy the bruised parts all over it though.  What annoyed me though is a couple of things that had nothing to do about the food (Maybe I was just in a bad mood)...  1.) We made reservations and our party of six arrived about 15 minutes early - there were plenty of places for our party to sit and there was no other parties waiting - so why did we have to wait?  Once they finally got around to seating us they stuck us clear in the back - I just don't like the layout of the restaurant very much - the back rooms feel closed off from the rest of the restaurant and the small room we were in felt somewhat claustrophic and our party of six was crammed in like sardines - even though there were other places to put us.  I hate being squished!  2.) We were seated right next to the table that had our server's sister and boyfriend.  Guess who got the amazing service we should have had.  Our service wasn't horrible - I just felt like an afterthought.  She wasn't rude - just was more interested in talking to her sister and her date instead of checking in our her other tables.  Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date.   3.)   Like I said - maybe I was just in a bad mood - but why oh why every time we have gone here - we get seated near the large parties with annoying little kids - I have been there, done that.  I never let my kids screech to their hearts content when they were little - and the five year old - running around their table and screaming - Grrrrr!     I am really not in the mood to go back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This is the second Lucille's location I've ever been to...  I'm not the biggest fan, but there's worse out there.  First off, I must rave about their strawberry lemonade.  It's served in those great big jars and it's bright pink, sweet and refreshingly delicious in the summertime.  I had two jars...  The pre-dinner biscuit (singular) reminded me a lot of the ones at KFC...probably my least favorite item.  I ordered a combo of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  The ribs were great (next time I'm ordering a full rack), the brisket and pulled pork were kinda...meh.  But that strawberry lemonade...hot damn, it made it all worthwhile.  So yeah, not the greatest place, but if you're a rib fan, I'd say go for it.",

We went last week on a Wed. night and ended up eating in the bar which isn't a bad thing at all.  Fried Green Tomatoes is a GREAT starter with a margarita!  The better half had the ribs but still feel that Tony Roma's has the best ribs head to head.  I might concur.  But for gooooood smoked beef brisket, NO ONE can match Lucille's!",

I'm from the south apple butter to me is not butter with apple in it, which is what they give you.  Don't get me wrong!  It's really tasty, but not what I was expecting when she told me apple butter and biscuits.  The beans were gross but the pulled pork sandwich was actually really yummy!  The sweet potato fries were spot on as well.  The sauces were good too.  Overall it was a tasty place.  Being from Tennessee I was expecting food from home and despite the miss wording it was mostly perfect.  There is no helping the beans though.",

    "text": "Very disappointing Thanksgiving... Since my boyfriend & I couldn't make it home (Cali) for Thanksgiving this year, my consolation was being able to enjoy a nice turkey dinner at Lucille's. I was so looking forward to having smoked turkey with the sides (for me, it's all about the sides!). My BF's parents had made reservations for 6pm; imagine the anticipation, as the smoky smells that greeted us upon arrival were divine.  Imagine also, the dispair I felt when the waiter informed us that they ran out of turkey AND ham over half an hour ago! WHAT THE WHAT?!? I then asked if I could order ribs or chicken and still get the sides-he said he would check-when he came back, he said no. He didn't even seem apologetic in any way, which was like salt on a snail... In the end, I ordered something called MardiGras Chicken, which was just okay. At that point, nothing would have sufficed. Based on the fact that: 1) they could have told us about running out of turkey (the reason for being there in the first place) BEFORE seating us, 2) the sheer apathetic attitude & inept service from the waiter, and 3) no apologies from management--I'd have to give Lucille's a THUMBS WAY DOWN.",

After we were seated the waiter had said they had ran out of Turkey because of the expected outside orders around 3:00 pm; however the good news was they now had more Turkey.  We put our orders in for the Thanksgiving Turkey dinners.  Within ten minutes another waiter came to inform us that there wasn't any Turkey.  That they had not expected the high volume of take out orders.  We decided to stay since we there and we were already seated and our drinks had been order.   We realize that waiters were not at fault.  Some folks got up and left.  Some others were annoyed and complained.  The management did not offer a discount or even a complimentary piece of pie.  I felt that the management were aware of the reservations that had been made.  They were also aware of all of the orders for pick up that had been placed.  They had not planned accordingly.  By the time we left they had even ran out of ham.    We have had our Thanksgiving dinner there for the past three years.  However we will not plan to have it there again.",

Being that it was Easter Sunday, we knew that it was probably going to be busy and just as expected we waited for 25 minutes to be seated.  After we were seated, the lady who sat us had a bad attitude.  Being that we just got out of church, we let it go.  We ordered and I was looking forward to tri-tip BBQ with cheesy grits and braised greens.  After about 30 minutes, we noticed that the larger party who were seated much later than us, were getting their orders.  So we asked our server about our food and he told us it was because the kiddie burger was ordered well done and so it takes a little longer.  After another 30 minutes, we asked again and this time we were told it's because they are short handed.  Our food started coming one by one and each plate were cold.  My aunts fried catfish was cold and fries were cold and stale.  My tri-tip BBQ platter was cold, the cheesy grits was cold and so was the braised greens.  In fact, the braised greens was so cold that butter was clumping.  The well done kiddie burger was cold with stale fries.  We couldn't believe they even served it!!  We talked to the manager and she was going to fix it.  We waited for another 45 minutes and still no food.  We were so hungry that we just walked out.  This ruined our Sunday afternoon!  Shame on you Lucille's BBQ!!  Terrible customer service!!!",

I let her know it was no ok at all for her to be doing such things washing or not.  Worried if she is the manager what are the other employees learning from her about food safety and handling.",

Stupidly, simple as that. lol  Got the sampler platter for the main course. It had tri-tip, baby back ribs, bbq chicken, a watermelon and mac and cheese as our sides. Lemme tell you that after our appetizer platter, I was pretty much dunzo. But, had to shovel some ribs, and mac in cheese in me.  Love their sauces on the table. Full bottles of regular bbq, spicy bbq, and sweet bbq. I like to mix the regular with the spicy!  Again, our server was a sweetheart! Always with the refills of sweet tea and other delish alcoholic beverages we had on hand =)",

    "text": "Let me set the standard for this review that it's for TAKE OUT ONLY. I have witnessed nothing but positive service while dining in. This isn't the first bad takeout experience but we chose to give them the benefit of the doubt. I called in to order because their online service was down. When I called in I was asked to hold to be transferred to the takeout desk. I sat on hold for 5 minutes and hung up because no one at the take out desk had ever come on the line. When I called back I was asked to hold this time and I obliged. When the gentlemen came back on the line he asked for my number and began to place my order. I ordered a bbq bacon burger medium with beans, a kids rib with beans, a 1/2 order of the southern chicken strips Well done or crispy to which the gentlemen replied \"okay well done i'll make sure to tell them\" and a large fry. He repeated the order back to me and then asked if I wanted complementary apple butter and biscuits. I said yes. He asked if I wanted plates and utensils. I said yes. He asked if I wanted extra bbq sauce and listed off the three types. I said original, yes please. Throughout the entire conversation he was friendly and kept saying things like awesome awesome, right on, you got it etc etc. He gave me my total and said 20-25 minutes. When picking up the order my mother noticed that my chicken was not well done or crispy nor did it say so. She asked the cashier for my chicken to be recooked. Side note I always ask for chicken crispy or well done after getting not cooked chicken enough times before. The cashier (male) said he had to get a manager. The manager agreed to get the chicken taken care of but was not apologetic or friendly at all. The chicken came out well after this and they did give me extra, however my fries were then barely filled and we paid for a large side of fries. I gave up at this point. Upon leaving my mother noticed their was no bbq sauce in there like requested. We had waited 35 minutes at this point between picking up original orders and recooking and the cashier (male) decided to throw some serious attitude at her for asking for some. His response was \"well did you ask for some\". It's very frustrating to see such a place give such attitude and disrespect to customers who are very frequent. I'll probably second guess coming here at all any longer if you don't want to accommodate your guests. As a further side note the manger radioed the cashier (male) that we dealt with the entire time (just not sure if it was him on the phone) and asked him if he had been asked for well done chicken. He lied. I have a huge problem with people not holding themselves accountable especially over something so small. It's not like your job would be in question over this. I believe the manager should've followed through on making sure this order was completed accurate afterwards and should've been a more apologetic and personable human. I believe the cashier shouldn't have ever copped an attitude with my mother and should be talked to regarding this. My family comes from a background of hospitality and this was anything but in our experience today.",

The food was good. The service was even better. Our server was the best! She explained the menu, came by with refills often, and got our food out in a reasonable time. The environment was nice as well. They took reservations and were very professional. The bathrooms were also very clean, which is a plus!  The ribs were the best thing on the menu. The half chicken was also very good. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. The brisket and the pulled pork were just very plain to me. I've had it waaaaaay better at other barbecue restaurants around town. The greens were really good. The mac & cheese was just okay. The strawberry lemonade won't let you down.  I would recommend this place if you're craving some barbecue and are in the area. I don't know how much better it is than Famous Dave's. They each have their own positives and negatives, but I don't think Famous Dave's has greens as a side. Plus, the location is prime since it is in The District. You can go shopping at Charming Charlie afterwards!",

The brisket was the best I've ever had, my friend got the tri-tip and gave me some and I think that tri-tip was the best meat I've ever had. You could see the smoke ring on the meat and in each bite you could take the smokey hickory. Sides were good, nothing crazy but the meat was amazing.  Last thing, the waiter was very good. Service seemed really good overall and maybe we just lucked out with our waiter but he was a really attentive guy. This place is a little pricey but worth it for that authentic, smoked barbecue.",

They always over seat the place and you were lucky to get your water refilled. After a few months we went back because of a gift card. We decided to sit at the bar for happy hour and now we both really enjoy the place. The bartenders (Sarah and Chilla especially) are always friendly and make excellent drinks. If it wasn't for the bar service this would be a 1 star review.",

Our other go to BBQ place was a bit out of the way, but we should have gone with that and dealt with the drive.   Everything at Lucille's, besides the fried green tomato, and the Hop Ride IpA by Tenaya Creek was BLAND. Flavorless wings, bland Mac n cheese, seasonless burnt ends, absolutely NOTHING on the tri-tip sandwich besides meat, and had it not been for the sauce it was drenched in, that would have completely lacked flavor too... I don't understand the high accolades when we couldn't even get our kid's food out on time, much less a water refill.   Sorry Memphis Championship BBQ. We won't be cheating on you again.",

She showed me to my table and when I asked her about what she recommended she knew the menu really well and shared some of her favorites which was very helpful. When my server came out she also gave me good insights on what to choose so I picked a lunch special the 3 combo of BBQ chicken, beef tri-tip & the beef ribs with sweet potato fries and the mixed vegetables. Personally, chicken breast is not my favorite as it can be a bit dry, however the BBQ chicken breast was super tender, moist and delicious. Same with the tri-tip - the meat was moist and succulent and the ribs were fantastic! I loved the sweet potato fries, (I could have eaten more of those!) I got the hot towels during my meal which was great for cleaning up from all the BBQ sauce. The service was great, the food was fabulous, I will definitely be back",

I have bought a full slab 7 times or so, excellent smoke job and Smokey flavor every time. I like their spicy bbq sauce   I went here after another close by barbecue place started going down hill and was surprised they copied many of Lucilles ideas, like garlic mashed potatoes, glass jar deserts, onion straws, etc. So now I skip them and go strait to the source of the barbecue ideas, Lucilles!  Take out always takes them at least 120 seconds to notice you standing there waiting, and sometimes a few more minutes for it to be ready. Its worth the hassle for such good bbq food. I usually call my order in instead of using the online ordering thing because the time ready is not accurate when you order online",

When you walk in you can smell the smoker going. I've been vegan slash vegetarian for a while now but decided it was a little time to cheat. Just a little. I did have some meat on my nachos. So again let's start with walking in. What place is super clean and they greet you with a smile and sit you pretty quickly. You can smell the aroma of the smoker cooking which kicks in your senses right away. Smart move on that one Lucille's. You sit down in your server comes right over and start you off with your drinks. Friendly nice and quick. Can't beat that. I ordered the half onion rings and half fried pickles with the brisket nachos. My wifey got the burnt end salad. Price was super good and they give you a ton of food. Even the half onion rings were piled high. The nachos were huge and oh so good. Everything hit the spot just right and had plenty left over for dinner later on. Keep up the good work Lucille's! I will definitely be back. By the way Bobby was a GREAT server!",

    "text": "We love this place. Food is amazing all the time. The other day we went in probably 9:45pm-ish (1 hour and 15 mins before closing), the hostess was kind and sat us promptly. We get to the table and order our drinks, and get them.  All of this takes maybe 6 mins give or take.  The server then asks what we'd like to order and thinking they'd start cleaning the kitchen like 30 mins before closing, and it's still a little more than an hour until this time, we ask for a couple more minutes to browse.  The server, who was quite obviously irritated and ready to be done, let's us know that the kitchen is closing in 2 minutes so we have to order now. So, my guest and I look at each other, cause the hostess perhaps should have informed us the kitchen was closing? Or maybe not even seated us at all? The server (maybe after seeing the slight shock on our faces) apologizes. We make a quick decision, and he's off.   I do totally understand that at the end of the day you're ready to go, but I work in the service industry, and you're supposed to smile and make the guests comfortable. Perhaps the farther from the strip, hospitality isn't a priority? We felt so uncomfortable because we were so clearly not wanted there, that we had a few bites in the restaurant, got to-go boxes and left.  I get that kitchens need to be cleaned and closed, but an hour before the restaurant is due to close? Come on.   Honestly, as wild as it sounds, we both agreed the vibe from our server made us lose our appetite. It was really odd. We both left feeling super uncomfortable. Having an uncomfortable feeling around people who deal with your food is never good. While waiting for the food we even joked about them going all 'Waiting' on us cause we really felt like awful humans for even daring to disgrace them with our presence.   It's not that they were rude, it's just a very crappy feeling eating somewhere (or being anywhere in general) when it feels like a burden. We are very understanding people, and we just wanted a quick meal to end our night, but instead our night ended very uncomfortably and left this particular location with a bad first and probably last impression.",

    "text": "One of my favorite spots for BBQ.  Lucille's offers some of the best BBQ in Las Vegas, but what sets it apart from me is that in addition to great BBQ, they offer variety and options that other BBQ restaurants don't.  The BBQ itself, I'd probably rate as a 4*, as its on the pricier side. However, they have a full menu and full bar, which a lot of BBQ restaurants don't have.  They serve hot buttermilk biscuits as starters and it comes with super tasty apple butter.  The butter has a sweetness to it, and pairs very well with the biscuits.  Their lunch specials are really good, and offer \"smaller\" portions of their dinner options with meat options coupled with their sides.  I've come here numerous times, so I'll list the items that I have tried and really enjoy.  Non-Alcoholic Beverages: - Sweet Tea - Unsweetened Watermelon Tea (my personal favorite) - Strawberry Lemonade  Alcoholic Beverages: - Back-porch Strawberry Lemonade - Crocodile Cooler  Appetizers: - Fried Pickles - Rib Tips - Brisket Burnt Ends  Entrees: - Southern Fried Chicken - Mardi Gras Chicken  BBQ Meat Favorites: - Brisket - Smoked Chicken - Tri Tip  Sides: - Mashed Potatoes - Vineagar Cole Slaw - Mac n' Cheese  Dessert:  - Snickers Ice Cream Pie - Banana Pudding (with real bananas & vanilla wafers)",

They have really gone down hill and are not half the restaurant they once were. They don't have the smoked wings or the peanut slaw anymore either. I would suggest going to Memphis BBQ instead. They still have greens at least. Oh and they got rid of the dirty rice which really made the gumbo and jambalaya so good.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to visit Lucille's today after church for lunch. We were sat quickly, met fast by server, placed order and drinks were delivered. Had a mix up with our food being delivered and served to the table next to us (they ate it and didn't even question) wouldn't have even noticed except we had been there for more than 20 minutes prior to them so thought it was strange they would be served before us. Anyways, this is not a complaint, but a compliment on how quickly \"Brett\" manager on duty went into action. He was extremely apologetic, explained the situation, advised new order already placed on the fly and served us personally. He was nice enough to comp our bill, but didn't have too. He continued to check on us in addition to wait staff. Although extremely satisfied at this point, he even brought a shareable dessert to the table which the kids and hubbs enjoyed (I may have had a bite or two). I just wanted to thank Brett and his staff for owning this situation, aiming high to correct it and and making our visit enjoyable in-spite of the lil mix up. We will for sure be back to this location. Thank you!",

The baked potato with a side salad is amazing!  (Only served during lunch) I ordered the burnt ends salad during my last visit. I wasn't too impressed. But everything else I have ever ordered was delicious!  The brisket burnt ends appetizer along with the onion strings are on point!  Service during lunch is a little slow, but probably because I'm usually in a rush. Customer service is also great!  Don't forget the complimentary biscuits with apple butter!  Very thick and fluffy. Might get you full before your meal but totally worth it!",

    "text": "I have to say I expected more out a 4/5 rated place with so many positive reviews. Hubby and I stopped by for late lunch a couple days ago after working up quite an appetite on a hike. We caught the end of lunch specials just in time. The platter allows you to choose three meats and one side. We each got our own in order to maximize the meat selection. Here's what we tried...  Burnt Ends - This is the one we were the most excited to try, so we each picked it as one of our meats. Unfortunately, it ended up being the most disappointing. It wasn't tender, it was quite chewy. It also had absolutely zero flavor.   STL Ribs - VERY dry and only so-so flavor. I don't think I've ever had meat THIS DRY at a BBQ restaurant.   Smoked Sausage - Now this was solidly decent, but I've certainly had better. It had just a tiny bit of heat and some good flavor.   Pulled Pork - Actually, surprisingly nice! I find that pulled pork is usually completely under seasoned and has to be covered with copious amounts of sauce. But not only did this have some decent flavors going on, but it was actually the most tender and juicy of all their meats.   Baby Back Ribs - The ribs definitely had the most flavor out of all the meats. This surprised me because they looked to be only lightly seasoned. And thank goodness they were as dry as the STL ribs (although certainly not as tender as BBQ should be)!   Sweet Potato Fries - They were very lightly seasoned with a BBQ rub. So lightly, in fact, they needed either salt or sauce. But they had a nice texture and I can never say no to sweet potatoes.   Over all, my problem was high expectations and also the fact that I've had truly amazing BBQ and this simply wasn't it. However, I'm glad I tried it. Now I know what I would and wouldn't get should I ever return.",

We made it a point on this particular visit to try some items that we've never had before. The menu consists of your regular slow, smoked meats, and also, an entire section devoted to some classic Southern specialties. Although the Southern shack themed restaurant is spacious and includes a large patio for outdoor seating, it's usually busy enough to be on a wait and a reservation is probably a good idea, especially on the weekend.  The tri tip, brisket, and both types of pork ribs are pretty good to me as long as they aren't smoked to leather status and I'll usually pick two of the meats for a combo. I gave the beef ribs a try this time and for $24.99, I got 3 bones which I think someone had gnawed some of the meat off them before they got to the table. And the meat that was on them was dry, tough, and gave my jaw muscles some extra work.  Lucille's brews by Golden Road Brewing Co. were also something I was always aware of, but had never tried. So I ordered Lucille's Beer Flight and for $6.95 you get nice sampling of four 3-4 oz pours. The Red Ale was my favorite and would be a nice pairing with all of the smoked meats.  My wife and daughter split the two meat combo ($29.99) with baby back ribs and the cheddar and bacon sausage. They devoured the ribs and I only got one bite of the sausage. The cheese and bacon in the sausage was as good of a combination as you'd expect it to be.  Service was solid for the meal and we felt comfortable in the Southern atmosphere. There's no rush, but we'll be back at some point because of the convenient location and I'll stick with my standard meats.",

To be fair, I don't have much BBQ wisdom so I don't know what to compare it to, but it's pretty darn good to me.  This place makes for a nice summer date night. Keep in mind, if you bring your whole family, the price will add up quick. If price isn't a concern, there's bound to be something for everyone (...except for vegans maybe??)

Over summer I asked for tritip by the pound, no sides, just to take home the next day for my husband. The girl acted clueless and it was so loud 8 could hardly hear her. After leaving I realized she charged me for 2 tritip meals and I got no sides, no discounted price for meat only or charging me by the pound. We went again as a family Tuesday night and they said a half hour wait. After 45 minutes we had to ask. We finally got seated and had one of the worst servers I have ever experienced at any restaurant. Took 15 minutes to get out drinks and take our order. It took another 45 minutes for food. He never checked in. They made an excuse that it was something with the baked potatoes... ok so could you come let us know and maybe we will have a clue or get a different side for the one person who ordered a baked potato?? At this point we just wanted to pay and leave but getting a check took forever and when he brought it over we just wanted our card ran so we could go. Tried to give him our card without even looking at the check and he wouldn't take it. Left the bill and ran off for another few minutes. After the whole thing, it took us 2 1/2 hours to eat bbq that is already premade. I doubt we will ever go back now.",

I went with the fried chicken breast, served with garlic mash and veggies topped with country style gravy and my husband picked a rack of ribs, I hate to compare but Famous Dave's wins in the food category by far.

Beware though - while other buffets and restaurants are plying with you cheap food in an abundant quantity, Lucille's will give you good tasting food at a reasonable price and will pull you away from the strip.  Why is this bad you may ask?  Well, because there's no gambling there and if you're in Vegas, you may as well get your food 100 feet from a table game rather than 15 minutes from the strip.  But I will say this, when you come to Lucille's, bring your A-game or you won't finish your food.  And that makes you a wuss.  Yeah, you heard me, Chris.",

I ordered a veggie burger tonight and there was a piece of meat on it :(  I picked up take-out, brought it home, and didnt want to return to fix it. I did call to let them know and the manager was very curteous, even offered a comp.  However I did learn that they grill the veggie burgers on the same grill as the meat. That's how the meat ended up on my burger. If this concerns you I don't recommend eating here.",

I think they have some type of pickle thing or something, that they keep trying to push on me. But that okra is just too good. That butter they have for the bread, what is that...apple butter? Oh man, it is like buttahhhh...seriously. At the end of the night, you get a tootsie pop, and hopefully you get one with the indian shooting a star.",

I remember that I had eaten at Lucille's in Cerritos and wondered if they had one in Vegas. When I found out there was one in Henderson I was licking my chops.   I had the Back Porch. This consists of half a chicken, tri tip and ribs. I got the beef ribs. The trip tip was awesome, just wish there was more of it. The half chicken was not my speed. It was just too much meat and well it was chicken. Now, the ribs, AMAZING. So juicy, moist and delectable. I kept chewing on the ribs like a dog they were so good. The sides were great too, really creamy coleslaw and awesome potato salad. Sweet tea could have been sweeter but was fine by me.   The Memphis sauce was awesome. I just needed this meat fix and boy I was happy I got it.",

They were out of corn on the cob which was disappointing but the meats were really good, Before the meal we received biscuits and i ordered a salad which were both great and had some of the best apple butter and Ranch Dressing I have ever had.  when my main meal arrived one of the beef ribs was over cooked but they replaced it with a fresh one quickly. I washed it all down with some Watermelon Ice tea which was really refreshing. Overall a great meal worth 4 stars. But what really made it great was the staff. Our server was great which I forgot her name unfortunately but she was a small Latin girl with a giant smile and was great . And the manager Carissa running the ship helped me when I lost my Credit card which i really appreciated. I like when a restaurant has nice people that really try to help. It makes the whole experience that much better so I will give them one more star for a total of 5...........",

Dessert: Banana pudding. The meat is savory & melts in your mouth, the ingredients are always fresh, and their customer service is excellent. I make trips to NV just so I can get my Lucille's fix ;-). They give you so much food, that it's enough to last for 2-3 days. I'll be glad when they hurry up and open the one in Concord, CA, so I can stop making fictitious \"business\" trips to Henderson for some BBQ.",

It was more than enough to feed 4 adults and a child. The baby back ribs were very succulent. So much that writing about it is making my mouth water. For sides we ordered roasted garlic mashed potatoes, southern braised greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried. OH cant forget to mention that the homemade biscuits with apple butter is so good. All the sides were fresh and importantly, good LOL  We went on a Saturday night and the wait was not bad at all. We got our drinks a few minutes after we sat down. After we made our order, we received the sides and order within 10 - 15 minutes.   The only bad thing about this place was that there were people smoking at the entrance and I thought that it was very rude because there was a smoking area a few yards away from the door. So if you smoke please be considerate and smoke in the designated area. Kids and people who are pregnant don't want second hand smoking. I give it a three star because of this. I couldn't enjoy sitting outside in the patio area without smelling the smoke. Also parking sucks here.",

When she suggested Lucille's in her area, I told her about our mishaps at RR.  She'd also had a couple of unfortunate dinners there, but assured me that this one was much better, so we figured we'd give it a try.  If one of the other three had written this review, they'd probably give it 5 stars, but I, the Queen of Kvetch (Google it or watch the movie Norma Rae), wasn't quite as pleased.  Still, it was heads above the other place.  I was the only one drinking, so I ordered my usual glass of Riesling.  It tasted like gasoline.  The waitress, Lisa (who was a real sweetheart), cheerfully changed it for a white zin.  That one may have been the worst white zin I've ever had, but I kept it anyway.  Our friends had the ribs and loved 'em.  Herb made the better choice, ordering the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portobello Sandwich.  If I had done that, I would have been much happier.  My brisket was shredded, and I didn't notice that in the menu description.  I like slices.  The brisket itself was delicious - moist and not fatty.  But my sandwich was just brisket, with nothing to offset or complement the meat.  Herb's had the portobello, but also sauteed onion.  My other bad choice wouldn't have gotten better no matter what I chose:  the default was a soft potato bun.  When I eat a sandwich, I crave dense bread with a hard, crusty crust.  After being in Vegas for ten years, I've come to the realization that it doesn't exist here, the way it does on the East coast or California or Chicago, or probably even Iowa...everywhere but in Vegas.  I swapped the soft bun for the baguette, which turned out to be just a different shape of soft bun.  Without my asking, the manager came over, very concerned, and asked if I wanted some other bread or something else entirely.  Since other bread wouldn't end up being what I was craving, I kept the sandwich.  And to my surprise, she comped the sandwich.  But I did like that brisket, and shouldn't eat all that bread anyway.  If the wine hadn't been so awful I would have given Lucille's 4 stars.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and the poor choice of sandwich was mostly mine.  The service was excellent, and it's obvious - even at the Lucille's at Red Rock - that management really cares about the guests.  On second thought, I'm upping it to 4.",

However, this is now my second visit and I'd have to be a crazy lunatic to come here again, because the 2 hours I lost will never be recouped ever again.  You shouldn't have to wait, wait, and wait even more...hire some more staff, get a server outside, DO SOMETHING but be ignorant to patrons.

    "text": "A few months ago I wrote a review under a different account I've since lost the log in info for. As a result, I received a message from Lucille's asking if they could send me a $25 voucher for another try which I did not respond to.  On todays visit, I took friends from England here for lunch.  We were all plenty hungry and the smells emanating thru the parking lot didn't help. I said not a word to them about my prior 9 year history with this location.  This review is based upon our experience today, not just mine.   We arrive at 1:50 pm & sat at a booth in the bar for an unreasonable amount of time just to be greeted. When we were, 20 minutes later, our server handed us 3 menus, plates, etc., yet there were 4 of us.  One left for the restroom during our wait, so its safe to assume our server never noticed us until just before coming over. Mind you, the bar was not terribly busy or near capacity.  Another 15-20 minutes later she returned.  We were ready to place our entire order.  After taking our appetizer order, she only accepted our drink order. Once the 4th drink order was spoken, and while she was still speaking, our server walked away.  We found that a tad rude.  My friends were not impressed.  Forget we are 40 minutes in without drinks, we found that interaction with our server to be quite rude & unprofessional.   10-15 minutes later our drinks arrived & THEN she took our order: tri tip sammie, southern fried chicken sammie, lucilles salad, and a BBQ salad.  My friend who ordered the BBQ chicken salad was asked for a side choice & she chose peanut slaw.  When our orders arrived, she receives not the BBQ salad, but the BBQ chicken sandwich.  This explains the choice of side ask.  Not sure how our server got the two mixed up, especially when the salad was pointed to on the menu.  Fortunately she had the peanut slaw.  By the time we 3 were more than half way thru our meal, her salad arrived.  I am stopping my story here.  Essentially, our server, while quite nice, was just terrible. Not efficient at all.  We spent more time WAITING than we did eating. We should not have been there for more than 2 hours, an hour of which was spent waiting to be greeted & to have our drink order taken. I think the last straw from my friends was when the server apologized for not understanding their accents. Granted, some English accents are difficult to process.  Theirs couldn't be more understandable.   The bread was warm and not hard as a rock, which was a nice change.  Unfortunately, my tri tip sandwich arrived at room temperature & was dry.  Fries were cold & overdone. Our server would have known this had she bothered to check in with us, but she didn't.  On a side note, I had a view of the kitchen. Food sat in the pass way longer than it should have.   Sorry Lucille's.  You asked for a 2nd try and I gave you one. On my full dime. This time was clear: I shan't return ever again.    As for our server. She never gave us her name or I'd name her.",

The corn chowder was just okay - was expecting it to be pureed and creamier, but was just pieces of corn in a soup (try the corn soup at Spago and you'll never be disappointed!!!). The portobello burger was good and the bbq sauce was just okay - wish they had a mild sauce with a more hickory/smoky flavor. I was not impressed the cheese grits - they were not creamy or very flavorful (needed more sharp cheddar and liquid to make it creamier). I went with a very large party of 18 co-workers, and while the waiter seemed a little flustered by our party size, he kept up fairly well with our orders. Overall, it was a decent experience and it was great they were reasonably priced and had vegetarian options!",

I obsessively order out ALL the time cause we're super busy and this is one of the only meals I've had in such a long time that I can really say is very homemade tasting.

However, when I was served the salad I immediately noticed the difference between the salad years ago & the salad now. The shrimp was not hot off the grill & was cold to touch. The shrimp & Corn were both missing those char marks. The Manager agreed that even though the salad was brought back on the menu it is prepared a little differently than before & the Shrimp should be hot to touch not cold. She took the salad back so that it can be corrected. The Salad was brought back to me with well seasoned & hot shrimp. It was yummy, still somewhat different but yummy. Sweet Tea with lemon, complimentary rolls with honey butter & Fried Onions were all on point. The BF was not happy with his rib tips saying it was more like strips of meat cut off of ribs. Lots of places to sit & our waitress was very helpful & pleasant.",

Literally every thing I've tried I find myself thinking about the following day. The appetizers we got were the frieda pickles and the bbq potato chips. I could not have enough! I was in between wanting to eat all the appetizers and saving room for my big burger. They also offer you bread to start and its it was to die for just the right amount of sweet and it melts it was so soft to the touch it practically melts in your mouth.  My main entree was just as good as it looked in the photo I saw on yelp. I ordered the smoked brisket burger. It was huge and savory. The meat was tender to perfection. There is a large variety of sides you can get and I got macaroni and cheese which was the best mac and cheese I've had in a long time.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! The service was great our waiter was very attentive I think his name was Alfonso he gave us great service and definitely made our experience with his service  Can not wait to come back and bring my family next weekend (:",

    "text": "After reading all the good reviews on yelp we decided to hit up this place for some lip smacking BBQ.   We all feasted on the family plan of ribs, chicken and 4 sides. We opted for a complete revolt of health conscience eating with mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, grilled corn, and baked beans. We also ordered their fried pickles-yum!   There are mixed reviews overall for this place from myself and the group I was with. The ribs served to us in our family style meal were kinda burnt overall-some were juicy and moist and some just had some extra sauce slapped on like lipstick on a pig. As a contrast my nephew got the child's plate of 3 ribs and his were all thick, moist and juicy-very succulent looking in comparison. Strange, eh?  The sides were extremely sub-par. I would say if you are coming here don't even bother with the corn, I am pretty sure it was previously frozen because the husk was soggy. The mac and cheese was alright, but tasted like it was made with something along the lines of Velveeta. The chicken was good, juicy and perfectly cooked.  Also a plus is for those crazy enough to want to sit outside-there are misters to help keep you cool.",

I hardly ever feel like eating barbecue, but after listening to one of my friends go on about how incredibly delicious Lucille's is, I had to check it out for myself. There was no wait at all when we went and we got our orders in right away: one sweet tea, water, onion straws ($8.79), and BBQ Beef Ribs ($28.99 for 7 bones). Our entree was served with homemade biscuits and two sides (macaroni and roasted garlic mashed potatoes). The apple butter and biscuits might've been my favorite part of the whole meal. I wasn't very fond of the onion straws, but that's because I never really am. Don liked them a lot though. The sweet tea was very tasty and refreshing, but didn't come with free refills, so we just nursed it. The beef ribs were very hearty and mouthwatering. They were well cooked and very tender as well. Definitely the best ribs I've had at a restaurant in a good while. Even though the food was awesome, I'll admit I think the place is a tad overpriced, which is why I'd probably only come here a few times in a year.

I have eaten there a handful of times, and while the ribs aren't my all time favorite, there are some excellent choices on the menu...   Megan M. and I were trying to decide on a place near GVR to meet up with our husbands for some drinks, and since I have had such great experiences at Lucille's in the past I suggested we meet up there. Lucille's happy hour is from 3 to 7 Monday-Friday, and is available in the bar area only, but offers great deals on both drinks and food.   I started out with the strawberry lemonade, which is alcoholic but sure didn't taste like it. Two of those went down very, very easily. My husband and I split two orders of the sliders, which were $3.99 for 2. You get your choice of bbq beef, pulled pork or buffalo chicken. The pulled pork was my pick, it was overflowing with lots of pork covered in tangy, tasty bbq sauce. I snagged a piece of the buffalo chicken from my husband and it tasted more like bbq then buffalo sauce to me, but he didn't complain about it.  The only negative aspect of our visit was the slowness of our server. My husband and I arrived after Megan and her husband had already sat down and ordered drinks, and it took a while for someone to notice we were there with nothing to sip on. As the night progressed the bar area got more and crowded (people just standing by the bar to take advantage of the drink prices) so if you want to sit down to enjoy your grub, arrive early!",

As a foodie, though, I would still go back (I'd rather have great food and poor service than vice versa) and just make sure I'm paying attention to what the servers are doing.  They wanted us out ASAP!",

    "text": "Only gave 4 stars because of the wait, but it was the dinner rush so I understand.  Ordered the fried okra and was happy. They were crispy and not soggy at all! Had the portobello beef brisket sandwich. It was great, but a little too much bread so finished it without the bread.  Let's be honest I'm not picking if that's my only complaint. Mom and daughter shared a half slab of baby backs and they were licking their chops! Wife had brisket sandwich and she was licking the plate!  Bottom line there was a whole lot of finger licking and a whole little chit chat!  This was my second visit and I love it just a as much as the first time!!",

    "text": "Lucille's came through when we had our son's rehearsal dinner. We scheduled it for the wrong date. I called Lucille's and they put our order ahead of others and had a caterer on site. They did an amazing job when we didn't know what to do. We had 55 people waiting on the dinner. They had the entire catering request to us in just a little over an hour. If this wasn't enough, the food was amazing. Everyone commented that it was worth the wait!  The cater helped us get set up and made sure we had everything we needed before she left. She told us to call if we needed ANYTHING. I would definitely eat and cater from Lucille's again.",

I had a Sangria that was tasty with dinner and we all split a slice of caramel salted cheesecake which was spectacular! Service was on point and everyone in our party was happy with our experience.",

It was AMAZING I was so full I did not eat the veggies..well who needs veggies when you have those amazing biscuits w/apple butter.. To bad it is so far away from where I live I can't go as often as I want to but next chance I get I WILL be there..",
