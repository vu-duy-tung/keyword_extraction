Actually, the description I gave was more a compliment because I could have been a lot more brutal.   It's kind of like The Varsity in Atlanta. If you like greasy burgers in cheap white buns, somewhat  average chili over an even more average hot dog, then it's your place! The place has been around for years and it has a loyal band of Georgia Tech alumni that would swear by nothing else. To them, it's comfort food and brings back memories of their school days - and that's great. It's been around for 50 years and it'll be there another 50 years... It doesn't change the fact that the food is crap but their customers will rave about how great it is.   I think it must be the same with your place. You have loyal customers, for whatever reason, but don't even begin to pretend that you're dishing out good Italian food, because you're not. Well, not to me you aren't. I'm comparing it to Italian food that I know to be good. I've been all over the world - including Italy - and I know the difference. Your food is no different to what you would get out of a Stouffers box or at an Olive Garden.",

The garlic bread is a soggy sliced sub roll with butter and no real garlic flavor.  The fried calamari was terrible!  Soggy and greasy, no crunch at all and a pool of grease on the bottom of the plate.  The chicken parm was another disappointment.  2 small chicken tenders, a little sauce, a little cheese, a little pasta, and a pool of water on the bottom of the plate.  An Italian restaurant that serves pasta swimming in water??  C'mon that ain't right.  It's not overly expensive, but for the portion and the quality, it's still a rip-off!  Oh, and the parking is a joke.  I suppose its because the place is so crowded (no idea why), or maybe its the bar, or maybe the fast food place... whatever the reason, good luck finding a parking place.  No reason to give this place a second try.",

It's not breaded and had no taste.  Their marinara is pretty bland, very watery.  I noticed most everyone on here gets a dish that doesn't involve their marinara.  Their garlic bread was good.  My son liked the Fettuccine Alfredo a lot.  The service was friendly, but slow to get the food to the table.  I guess I would try this again, but would order something different.  Do not get the Chicken Parm.",

The young boys who greet guests at the door and bus the tables were lovely and adorable but the food was really average or less than average.

I figured I must have visited on an \"off\" night before.  Nope.  Quite mediocre.  Food quality seemed greasy and cheap.  Fried Calamari:  Greasy but certainly edible (2.5 stars) Caprese Salad: Mozzarella (5 stars), tomatoes (less than 1 star) Tortellini with Vodka Sauce and added chicken:  pretty tasty (3.5 stars) Garlic Bread:  Tasty but cheap and I am huge bread fan (2.5 stars) Chicken Parm - terrible, way too salty (1 star)  Soda: crisp and bubbly (5 stars) espresso:  strong with great flavor (5 stars)  Ambience: bustling, a bit noisy because they are so busy, jubilant crowd during baseball game on bar TV, pleasant staff....This is a regular ol' family restaurant.",

    "text": "This little Italian place tucked away in West Las Vegas is absolutely awesome.  It's a decent drive away from Las Vegas, located close to Spring Valley.  As the others have said, the Garlic Bread is absolutely spectacular, just the perfect touch to any meal.  The food is quite authentic and will not disappoint.  The meatballs were extremely tender and the pasta was very fresh.  For any coffee lover, the expresso here is very good as well.  There isn't a single thing on the menu that I would shy away from.  As for the environment, the interior is quite cozy and good for a time out with friends or maybe even a casual date.  The noise isn't too loud nor is it awkwardly quiet, which makes it easy to catch up and maintain a conversation.  The service was good; however, at peak times it seems like they are understaffed.  The wait can sometimes be long if you don't call in advance for reservations.  Nonetheless, it is worth the wait.  Also, the parking lot is quite small, so you have to plan some time in advance to get a space or to park in the surrounding neighborhood.",

I had shrimp scampi, not bad, but it doesn't compare to Cheesecake Factory. We shared a chocolate souffle. Who serves souffle without vanilla ice cream? But if they did, it would be the best I've ever had, hands down! Its so sweet you'll either need a glass of milk or some ice cream (hint hint Nora). The service for us was below expectation. Trey was Inattentive to say the least. I could see him leaning against a wall by the bar instead of checking to see how the food was or if we needed anything. They had a band jazzing it up at 9PM, which certainly set the mood. Overall I would return. The food was good and we paid under a bill for two.",

    "text": "We had our food to go so this review so I can't speak for the dining in experience. We came across this place on one of those nights were nobody feels like cooking and after attempting two other Italian places that were listed as open on Yelp but turned out to be closed, we found Nora's.   Al Prosciutto Pizza - 4 Stars. Think a combination of regular run of the mill pizza with better ingredients. The crust wasn't super thick or super thin, def. not the artesianal-type but not chain-style either, rather just a nice middle ground. It had very little - basically no sauce or cheese as the first layer. The crust had been brushed nicely with olive oil and perhaps a light dusting of parmesan and large slices of sun dried tomatoes. The arugula and Prosciutto were added after baking but while the pizza was still hot, giving the greens a nice bit of wilt without being mushy, then more parmesan sprinkled on top. The only down side to this pizza was just too much garlic, and we actually like garlic, but this just had a bit too much. Deduct one star for that. I wouldn't want to have eaten it on a first date! If we ordered again we would just ask to hold the garlic. Other than that, great pizza. We had plenty of leftovers.   Spinach, Gorgonzola and Farro Salad - 4 Stars. The farro was nice and tender and topped with a generous portion of fresh spinach. The salad was rimmed with large slices of fresh, firm tomatoes and topped with crumbled gorgonzola. The salad losses a star due to slightly too much dressing for our taste. I would ask for dressing on the side next time, but other than that, a really nice, fresh and simple salad.   Rigatoni Special - 4 Stars. I wouldn't likely order this dish again, but that is because I don't happen to care for most of the meats in it, not that is wasn't good. The pasta was cooked to a nice texture and the sauce had a good flavor. A nice red sauce with just enough oil and spice to give it a little kick. The amount of meat in the dish was generous and the meatballs were flavorful and tender. The Italian sausage slices were what you'd expect, but if that's a flavor you like, then you'd be pleased. The sauteed green peppers were sliced very thick, making it so you could really taste their flavor as opposed to be little diced pieces you might miss in the dish.   Pasta Fagioli Soup - 3 Stars. I didn't care for this dish so much. I felt it was lacking in a bit of taste - maybe some salt or something. It had a generous amount of beans and pasta, and the pasta wasn't mushy, so I'll just chalk this up the fact it just wasn't quite my thing, not that it is bad per-se.   Bottom line, the place was pretty good and the prices were right. We'd definitely eat here again and check out some other menu items.",

    "text": "Nora's is legendary for Las Vegas. Every local tells their friends that this is the spot. I think it is for a few specific reasons. Food quality is always good and the dishes are consistent. Sequence and consistency of service is always on point. it is always busy. Everytime I have went, there is a small wait (not bad) because they are busy turning tables. Their operation is very efficient with scheduling. The price point is very afforadble and of course they are the home team favorite. They are the underdog off the strip. All that contributes to the fierce loyalty they receive from their customers. I would even dare to say they are like the Rao's of Las Vegas. No, they don't have a 3 month wait and their tables aren't owned by certain families and you have to get approval from them to sit there or anything silly like that, but you might want to be prepared for fisticuffs if you say anything negative about this place in certain circles.   I joke. . .  I checked in and they gave me a comp glass of wine. I made the entire table check in and they gave a comp carafe! Score! Winner! Winner! I think it was also because it was my girls birthday.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the atmosphere. I know they tried a second restaurant and it didn't do as good. I think that was probably because it lost some of its mom and pop charm that the original stores oozes. I too would have some hesitation on doing too many upgrades in order to not disturb an already successful business, but there has to be a happy medium that can be achieved where the design of the space can be more indicative of their food quality.   The lighting does not have enough highlights or shadows in the room. It is all diffused mid-tones so nothing stands out. There is no contrast on the walls. The ceiling has some ornate feature that I couldn't really make out. I like the pizza/app guy at the front as you walk in and a long bar inviting you to start there, but other than that the chairs and tables and lighting threw me off making me want a cooler atmosphere but it would not deter me from going there time and time again. The vibe was a little ho-hum. What about a little music in the background? Doesn't have to be themed to italian, adult contemporary could work too. I understand music is a big commitment as well. In addition it will also increase the overall ambience of the room and I noticed quite a few people that have most likely been going there for years (perhaps decades). They won't like the higher noise level, but it will most likely increase the length and purchase of the customer visit.  Ok I am rambling. The place is good. Eat there and love it.",

His exact words were \"this sauce is so good I want to drink it\" lol. And he honestly is not someone that compliments often. My daughter had the cheese pizza which was also really good. She's 7 and also made a compliment about how delicious it was. I had the linguini and clams it was pretty tasty except my hubby got the angel hair pasta with the arrabiata sauce and after I took a taste of that we ended up switching. He liked the linguini and clams better and I liked the angel hair and arrabiata better so it worked out very well. I just wanted to try something different. My husband had a cup of coffee and he said it was pretty good which is also rare for him to compliment restaurant coffee because he uses a French press at home and he swears they make the best coffee. We ended our meal with tiramisu. I have to admit as a tiramisu fan I didn't like the way it was prepared. The lady fingers were very soggy which ruined the entire flavor of the dessert. I am still giving Nora's 5 stars though due to the fact everything else was great. We will for sure go back whenever we're on that side of town.",

Not cool.   2. Third times a charm to cook a steak? NO. Medium rare does NOT EQUAL well done, but the server quickly offered to re-cook a new steak. Again, medium rare does NOT EQUAL rare- the second steak was not only unappetizing to look at, but also extremely red on the inside. At this point, the MANAGER came to CONVINCE us that it was the right cut and the right level of doneness. Third steak...AGAIN- it comes back medium well, but everyone has finished eating and it has been over an hour since we sat. For better or worse, we seemed committed to this third steak.  Not cool, I know what medium rare looks like and shouldn't have to be convinced/almost bullied into accepting it.   3. Check up on us. If you and other members of your party have ACTIVELY VOCALIZED CONCERNS/COMPLAINTS about the restaurant YOU ARE MANAGING, I would recommend checking on them to assure no other problems or even to offer solutions to fix problems. No manager in sight after initial conversation. Not cool.   Overall- expect good food, but know there is a long wait and apparently inept staff from my experience tonight.",

For my main course, I ordered the Rigatoni Special, with meatballs, sausage, onions, bell peppers, and tomato sauce. It was delectable. The meat was cooked to perfection, and the noodles were just the right amount of al dente. Our server / waitress was incredibly attentive. Not once was my water glass less than half full, and whenever my wine glass approached empty, she was there to pour me another from the bottle. Thank you, Nora's! We will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "The best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Environment: The inside is beautiful. After moving into their new location roughly a year ago, the interior finally lives up to the standard of the food which they serve. The restaurant is bright and open with an abundance of seating ranging from indoors, to a patio, to private rooms, and to a full-service bar. Each section of the restaurant has its own drawing points so I am never disappointed where I am sat. Interestingly, my favorite place to dine is up at the bar. It is clean and spacious and allows for easier conversation if you are on a date, however when I come with groups I opt for a table. Additionally, the open kitchen is nice and adds some ambience. Finally, there have been a couple times where I have come in during the evening sand there has been a live band which adds yet another classy touch to the restaurant.  Food: If the restaurant itself wasn't so nice, it's the food which has me coming back every time. Everything I have tried here has been excellent. I have tried various appetizers such as the grilled octopus, fried calamari, arancini, and the clams and each one has been delicious. For the main dish, I never miss ordering the rib-eye steak and the fettuccini carbonara. The steak is always cooked beautifully with tons of flavor, and it pairs perfectly with the creamy pasta. Additionally, their garlic bread Is phenomenal. They serve it complimentary and are very good about grabbing you more once you finish yours. We usually go through about 5 baskets during and before dinner and always take some home too because it is just that good! Their cocktails are nice too, and I have tried several them but I always end coming back to their house sangria which is the best I have ever had. It tastes so fresh and fruity without sacrificing being too sweet.  Service: Service is up to par with a classy restaurant as I mentioned before the waiters are always eager to get you anything you need without being invasive. Additionally, when I have sat at the bar the bartenders are very personable and helpful with recommending drinks and dishes and making conversation throughout the meal.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone I have recommended has loved it just as much as I had, so I will be back again and again and again!",

The pasta was great and was a huge serving. It had piece of eggplant baked on the top that wasn't mushy like eggplant tends to be. The ribeye was okay...my husband like it but fell in love with the truffle fries (again, a huge portion). Food isn't cheap but it's worth it. We will continue to return for date night.",

    "text": "First of all, they do take reservations online which I highly encourage to do. The restaurant was very busy even though it was a Wednesday night. Jessika was our server and she gave great service. She didn't make us feel rushed when we took forever and a day to look at the menu. She was very informative when explaining the menu and was very friendly despite how busy it was and how busy she clearly was.  As a starter we ordered the pork belly. It was tender and melted in our mouths, however the edges were a bit burnt so it would have been perfect without the burnt parts. As the entree I ordered the crazy alfredo but I asked to substituted the pasta for angel hair pasta. My dish was delicious, the only thing I wished was that I rememebered to ask to have it without the jalapenos. The shrimp portion was generous and I enjoyed the creamy sauce. My husband ordered the rib eye. The first parts of the steak was cooked medium well rather than the medium rare he had asked for, but as he continued down the rib eye it was cooked more toward his liking. His rib eye came with truffle fries, which were mostly eaten by me, haha. We had to get our food taken to go. Jessika did mention that the portions were fairly large, but when she said that I didn't know she meant it was enough for 3 meals. No complaints though. It means no cooking the day after which is always a plus for me. For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake with some kind of pistachio sauce. The center was perfectly gooey and went deliciously with the sauce. The reason why I put 4 stars for this experience however is because the section we were put in was with large parties and they were really loud. I felt like I was yelling so my husband can hear me talking. When we come again, I will remember to make a note on my reservation if we can be in a quieter spot in the restaurant.",

    "text": "Nora's Cuisine has been seen as Las Vegas's best kept secret since opening in 1991. I recently was let in on that secret when I was on West Flamingo with a strong craving for Italian Food. When I walked in I noticed the decor of dark cherry and textured paint on the walls. My first condo was decorated  similar so it felt very inviting. The limited seating also made for a cozy dining experience.  We were brought some complimentary garlic bread almost immediately after being seated. The aroma from the bread was intoxicating but when I bit into the bread the grease was too heavy that I felt it on the roof of my mouth. I've had better garlic bread so I just moved on to the Caesar Salad. The Romaine lettuce was crisp and lightly coated with homemade dressing.  Honestly the croutons that topped the salad were much better than the bread and the Caesar dressing was perfect.   I was torn between the Chicken and Veal Parmigiana so I asked the waiter his favorite out of the two. He said he preferred the Veal. When I can't decide sometimes I ask for the waiter's advice as a tie breaker but it doesn't always go so well . I'm happy to say this time the waiter knew what he was talking about! The veal was tender inside with crispy outer breading. It was served  over a tasty marinara sauce and topped with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese. I also tested my husband's Baked Rigatoni which was made with a meat sauce, rigatoni, ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. My impression at first bite was it was too salty. It tasted better the next day.   On a sweeter note we had the Oreo Tartufo for dessert. It was a ball of cookies and cream ice cream covered with a hard chocolate shell. It was big enough to share and small enough where you wouldn't  feel sorry you ate it. It was sinfully delicious!   Nora's is great place for date night or a family dinner. The portions are generous and the service is excellent!",

Crazy Alfredo was pretty good, a TON of meat. Pretty rare that you run out of noodles before protein, but I was left with a pile of chicken and sausage after all the noodles were gone. Flavor of the sauce was decent, tasted like a bell pepper alfredo sauce.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing. Not bad by any means, but it is pretty hard to mess up a caesar salad. The dressing was just a bit too creamy for my liking and didnt have that tangy salty flavor Im used to with caesar salads. Could use some shaved parmesan too.  Calamari was just good, pretty basic dish. The sauce was interesting though.  The main downsides were an hour wait for pickup even though the restaurant wasnt exactly packed, there were plenty of open tables. Price was a bit steep, came out to $50 for an entree appetizer and salad. Also I specifically asked if the meal comes with garlic bread and was told yes, and they forgot to put it in the bag.. pasta without garlic bread is just sad..  Probably wont come back here for a while to be honest, just nothing to write home about, and so many other places with better tasting food in Vegas for much cheaper.",

My wife had the tortellini but unfortunately wasnt impressed. The noodles didn't seem like they were cooked long enough and were tough. Our friend had the marsala and has been here several times. He loves it and said it was good as usual. The setting was really nice, a little nicer than casual but not dressy. There was also a 4 piece band that was playing live music which really added to the atmosphere and made it that much more relaxing. Lastly the smells when you walk in are unbelievable, it smells so good my mouth was watering. If not for the tortellini it would be 5 stars.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I've had much better Italian food and service at other restaurants. My friend from out of town and I were both craving Italian food for her last dinner here! We stumbled on Nora's from Yelp and decided to give it a go. Like I said, I've had better service but it wasn't the worst. I will say the restaurant staff did keep up with refilling our waters, which was awesome! One of my pet peeves is when servers are not on top of water refills..I drink a lot of water while I eat.   So onto the food...hmm. Well the garlic bread was good. Hot and crispy! The first basket is free which is nice. Maybe I'm just stingy, but I was just a tiny bit annoyed to pay $2.50 more for another basket of bread. We decided on mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. They were hot and tasted like any other plate of mozzarella sticks. Tasty but nothing special about them.   My main dish was the most disappointing :( I was stuck between trying their Alfredo sauce or their pesto! I asked our waitress which one she preferred, and she just suggested I do a creamy pesto sauce to have a little of both! I thought...oooh perfect! When it came out it smelled amazing and looked like it was going to be a great dish. I took the first bite, it was okay..then I took another and was I a little confused if I liked it or not. As I kept eating all I could taste was pesto and maybe a tiny bit of cream sauce. And the pesto sauce just did not WOW my taste buds what-so-ever. I honestly took at most 10 bites and was over it..I was hoping for a wonderful Italian dinner here, and didn't find it. Instead of trying another dish, I will just try another restaurant. Sorry Nora's!",

I had came here for a special dinner and I must say - the italian food here is one of the best! The crazy pasta and the spaghetti were cooked to perfection! The crazy pasta had a little jalapeno kick to it with chicken, shrimp, tomatoes and bell peppers. The spaghetti with red sauce was cooked perfectly. It looks plain at first but the taste wasn't strong and had the right amount of basil and cheese. In the beginning, the appetizers were filling and left our party having to stop ourselves for more. Although I had to take a lot of food home I had to make room for dessert - the cannolis were the best part. This little tube of sweetness was the perfect ending for an amazing dinner! If you are looking for authentic Italian food stop by at Nora's! Make sure you call and reserve a spot for a slice of Italian heaven!",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating at Nora's based on reviews from various media and on Yelp.  Expectations led to disappointment.  Had lunch there today, ordered calamari, pizza, and angel hair with meatballs and marinara sauce.  The calamari was the best part of the meal, actually very good.  However, the pasta and meatballs were bland, sauce did not taste like any marinara sauce I have had, and the meatballs did not seem to have any type of seasonings.  On the opposite side, the pizza was so salty, could only eat a slice, and there was something missing that I just couldn't put my finger on until I got the bill.  That's when I discovered that the Capricciosa pizza we ordered was not what we received, instead our waiter, Travis, brought us a All 4 Stagioni; considering all the stuff on the pizza, no way could we tell what they were serving anyway and seeing our bill it all made sense about why the pizza tasted so different than what we were expecting.  Then to top it all off, the coffee we asked for never arrived, but the bill sure did!  Look, the place is nice and airy, very clean, and maybe there are other things on the menu that may be good.  But first impressions are important, and my impression is that in Vegas you better be good all the time, not just some of the time, or first time customers like myself will not return, and I won't.",

They still sat us down, but asked if we could finish our meal by 6:30 for the next reservation. We agreed as long as they could have the food done fast too. They said no problem.  And they did.   I ordered the Caprese Salad for an appetizer and of course filled up, so I didn't have much room for my main meal. I got the Crazy Alfredo following the advise of my fellow Yelpers.  It was Yum!!!

When I walked up to the hostess she informed me that my company didn't have a reservation. I was a bit confused because my DM had made one on 3 days ago. I had to wait for my DM to get there and come to find out that our private room had been booked at the wrong time. It was a little difficult to conduct our meeting since we didn't get the private room but they did a good job clearing people around us. The food was pretty good and they comp us free dessert. My overall experience was good except for the part where we had to convince them that they forgot our reservation. It would have been nice for them to apologize for the mix up and possibly had a manager looked in to it. I would recommend this place on a personal day but would we hesitant if you need to make a reservation.",

Sebastio was our server and he was so nice and checked on us at the right times even offering to refill our bread basket (loved that!) We ordered pasta fagioli soup, different than I am used to but everyone has there own version but good. We ordered lunch portion spaghetti and meatball (with one meatball $6.50 plus $1.50 for an extra meatball). Our lunch was very good. I loved the sauce and the perfectly cooked pasta. I want to go back ASAP to get a full size dinner entree because everything looked excellent! Check out the ribeye pictures on the reviews it looks better than some steakhouses! By the way, I was told to make a reservation if we come for dinner as the place is full and without a reservation the wait could be well over an hour.",

    "text": "If you know you're going to Nora's make a reservation at least a day before.. otherwise you'll be eating pretty late or waiting a long time. Otherwise, the bar is first come first serve. I actually prefer the bar because service is better and more prompt. Besides, the drinks here are AMAZING! My personal favorite is the Sicilian mule.  Location: The place is always busy, if you're going to relocate, why not make the restaurant larger to accommodate more people instead of having people leave due to the wait or if you call to make a reservation, not have any availability until late the night of.   Food: All the food I have tried here has been good. The fettucini carbonara, crazy alfredo, and wild boar pappardelle are great options for pasta, I also liked the Nduja pizza. They also bring out a basket of garlic bread to start, and don't be shy to ask for more. For dessert, the cannoli is soo good- I really enjoyed the mascarpone/ricotta filling.    Service: Like I mentioned before, the service is good at the bar, but at the table it can be hit or miss. Sometimes the server is attentive but sometimes you'll see them come by once in a blue moon. I've also come another time when one of our orders was not properly made, and when we spoke to the server and manager about the issue, neither handled the situation well. For a \"classy\" establishment, customer service should be top notch. Remaking the food is a must, but the dish should have been comped or at least provided some form of discount since the one person in our group didn't end up getting the remade order until AFTER we were almost finished with our meal.",

Talking to his busser like he was below him. I wanted to say something but my girlfriend wouldn't let me.   Only reason I gave Nora's a 3 star rating is because the food is always amazing.

I had the Veal Cannelloni al Bosco  which was nothing I've had before.  I thought the sauce was quite delicious, but the filling was a little dry.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Parmigiana.  The sauce was full of flavor and not watery.  However, the chicken did was not crispy, but instead a little soggy, so that was disappointing.

We arrived and were asked to wait while they got the table ready, not a big deal. We were seated and then proceeded to sit at the table for 10-15 before any one even acknowledged us. We eventually had our server come over who apologized for running late. She was going to take just our drink order but we had enough time to order our appetizer and dinner in addition to our drinks. We didn't want to risk not seeing her again. I got the Sicilian Mule (Moscow Mule) and my boyfriend got an Old Fashioned. My Mule was outstanding, could have used more Vodka but that's just me. My boyfriend thought the Old Fashioned was too sweet due to them adding an orange slice in addition to muddled brandies cherries. We got the garlic bread and the mozzarella sticks. Both were absolutely delicious. I got the seafood pasta which was great and my boyfriend ordered the primavera. We found ourselves unable to fully enjoy our meal for to it being unbelievable hot. Both of us were sweating like we were outside. We asked our server if there was a way to turn down the air, fully expecting them to say no. The server returned later and stated that it didn't go any lower, which I find hard to believe. We ordered the Oreo ice cream for dessert. The little kid in me expecting a small candle in it, since my boyfriend let them know it was my birthday, was crushed when it didn't come. Just the dessert by itself, no candle or cheesy little message saying \"Happy Birthday\". We were so disappointed by our experience of the environment and experience that it just didn't outweigh how good the food was. I have to say I was super disappointed, even more than I usually would be just because it was my birthday.",

The hostess and servers were courteous. Will definitely come back the next time we're in town!",

Let me add our voices to the chorus singing the praises of the Crazy Alfredo, which was amazing. The blend of flavors on this dish is excellent and understandably their most popular dish. Everything else was excellent, but the flourless chocolate cake (make sure you preorder it!) deserves special mention. I'm not even a chocolate lover, but the molten center combined with the pistachios in the sauce make this a wonderful treat. A great meal, and great staff and service. Make sure you make a reservation, as the secret is out and it can be hard to get a seat otherwise at this off the strip gem. Will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband has been to Nora's a couple times before it moved to its new location and wanted to bring his Italian wife here for dinner because he thought it was fantastic. The new venue is larger with a bar in the middle and dining rooms on either side with separate rooms off those areas. We were seated in the far room off the dining room with a large party with kids. Not what I envisioned for a nice dinner with my husband for our first night in Vegas. Not to mention, the server was so busy that we just got a nod acknowledging that she saw us but sat there quite a while before we decided to ask to be moved. There was no other option, so we sat at the bar and it was the best evening because of it. Even though the volume in this place is extremely loud, sitting at the bar allowed us to hear each other and we were entertained with the mixologist Alex working her magic. My husband and I started out with cocktails that we wouldn't have ordered because Alex made everything look mouthwatering. I had a fantastic strawberry basil drink that she was kind enough to tell me how to make as she was doing it.  We were given a choice of garlic bread or regular bread. The garlic bread are strips of very garlicky and buttery bread, something I couldn't eat as it was too saturated with butter for me but my husband had no problem.  We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and it was one of the best grilled octopus I've ever had. Plentiful and grilled to perfection with a nice char. My husband had the wild boar pasta dish which was full of meat in a savory tomato sauce. I opted for the salmon piccata which was cooked to medium, so moist and flaky. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of red wine with our entrees as well.  Alex was attentive and provided very good service. Although this is way off the strip, it is very popular with the locals so I recommend making reservations. I don't know if I would go back again because of the loud atmosphere and the hassle of trying to get a different table when we were unhappy with being stuck in the back of the restaurant with a large party, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the drinks.",

They moved closer to the street but they're still in the same complex on Jones and Flamingo. The new restaurant is much nicer and more modern looking with more capacity as well. However, it seems they kept the same layout. There is still a bar on one side of the restaurant so you can sit and have a drink while wait for a table. They have some very fancy signature cocktails so make sure you check out their cocktail menu. The service and the food are still great just as I remember. The ambiance is classy and cozy. It is good for both date night and family dinner. I will come back more often and definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good local Italian restaurant.",

Their new (I say new, but it's probably been there for years) location is very spacious! A bit echoey due to the high ceilings and tile floors, but if you manage to get a room to yourself, then you'll definitely appreciate the privacy! Try asking for one when you book a reservation.  As for the food, Nora's has also been exceptional, and they continue to defy expectations! The Garlic bread was dangerously addicting, the calamari was perfectly fried, and not overly battered. And the Veal Marsala was sublime! The veal was tender, the sauce was just the right thickness, the flavors were spot on.   Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to take a loved one, reconnect with friends, or even explore on a first date, Nora's will not disappoint! Be sure to make a reservation, because they WILL get very crowded!",

I basically lived off Nora's for a significant amount of my 19th year of life. Thanks for that Nora's! Gio used to sit me down and feed me pasta with meatballs and a sausage shaped like a penis - thanks for that Gio :D hahaaaaa  Good times. Their food is honestly delicious. They just opened a new location next to the old location and I'm so happy they did because they made the restaurant bigger which was needed, and they did a beautiful job with the new place. It's a wonderful environment to dine in.  I hear Gio is turning the old location into a pizza place, which I could not be happier about because I love their pizza. The Snow White pizza has been a favorite of mine in town for 14 years. And I'm a huge pizza lover with very good taste in pizza, when I say pizza is good it's very good. The service is always great as well. All in all a truly wonderful restaurant that has served this city for a very long time.   The Melrose pasta is my one of my favorite things on the menu. Love you Nora's! I need to go back so I can take photos of their food to add to my review! I have none! Sorry!",

They need to get on Open table or something because whoever this girl is that took my reservation, repeated it wrongly about 5 times before \"confirming\" --- \"4 people for 2PM on Mother's Day Sunday\".. only for me to call for confirmation as I'm driving to their restaurant that they don't actually open until 4 PM. I tried initially to make an online reservation and their system said if no availability then call which I did.  Now I'm scrambling for Mother's day reservations as we are trying to drive somewhere to eat. Sucks.",

For anyone that thinks Olive Garden is good Italian, do yourself a favor and come see what good food really is.    It does get busy, so I'd suggest making reservations.  For those that walk in, the bartenders are attentive, so that wait is not too bad.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars for Nora's. We went out to Nora's for dinner on Friday night. Got there around 5-530pm with a table for 5 adults and 2 kids + baby. We only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. It started to get busy right after we got seated. No kids menu but they did give my children a fresh pack of crayons to color on the paper cover on the table. The garlic bread is amazing! They use fresh garlic and it's pretty strong garlic flavor on all of the pieces. I ordered the rigatoni. It was fantastic! Covered in fresh mozzarella and 5 scoops of ricotta mounds on top. Tasted fresh, just wished the pasta would have been a bit more al dente but it definitely wasn't overly soft or mushy. Impressed that the iced black tea was fresh brewed and had great flavor. Most places, if it is fresh brewed, have a coffee taste or its old. Nora's cold black iced tea was delicious. The pizza was super good and the small size we ordered had atleast 8 descent sized slices. My 5.5 yr old and 4 yr old shared the pizza with my MIL who only ordered a salad. We still got to take home 4 slices for left overs. My MIL said the pizza was super good, I didn't try it but from the looks of it it looked awesome and cooked in a stone oven. Our whole table thought the food was great... except our extremely picky grandma. She ordered some type of soup and that was it. Our server was the best! He tried to help our grandma get something else but she said it was ok. The soup to her didn't taste like how she likes it... like Olive Garden . I think the servers name was Destefano. He truly was one of the best servers we have ever had anywhere and also had a lovely accent. All of the men who had served our table were polite and quick at serving or refills. I don't know how much the bill was but it was less than expected. Very posh clean atmosphere but not stuffy or snooty. The prices are very reasonable and comparable to other Italian restaurants. My husband and I will definitely be back, especially without grandma  the only reason it wasn't 5 stars for me was because 1. The second order of garlic bread didn't make it to our table until we were almost done 2. They forgot to bag it up for us to take it home and 3. The bathroom faucets were cool in theory but grossed me out. The hand dryer is attached to the faucet. The germs get blown right back onto your hands. I did appreciate that they offered paper towels in lieu of using the dryer. Super excited to come back for a date night for the husband and I to try other dishes and possibly some alcoholic beverages.",

I got there at 4:45 and I wasn't given my pan of lasagna until 5:15. I saw the manager walk past me about 5 times and not once did he apologize for the wait. My guests were arriving at 5:30 so needless to say I wasn't happy. I ended up getting home at 5:35.   The lasagna was not good! After I made a comment to my family that the lasagna didn't taste like I remember it, they all starting chiming in with more comments like: \"it tastes like spaghetti O's\"...what's that weird herb taste\"...\"I wasn't going to say anything but it's not very good\". I had 14 adults over and they only ate 1/2 of a full tray. A full tray is supposed to feed 15 people, so you know it wasn't good. I will not be back to Nora's and I have been going there for over 20 years when they had their smaller location.",

All at a fraction of what you would pay any place near Las Vegas Boulevard. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Las Vegas or any locals who live in the area.",

    "text": "We were swinging by Las Vegas for a quick weekend getaway, so I reached out to Philip T. for some Italian recommendations in town. Nora's was one of the off-strip suggestions.   I tried to reserve a table in the Yelp app, but they didn't have that service available. Tried OpenTable, which had the restaurant on the app, but it didn't take any reservations. WHAAT! So third time's the charm, right? Called the restaurant and they said that they are fully booked and wait time could be up to an hour and a half. But we had to be there to put our name down. We were determined to try this restaurant, so we drove out there and was met with a packed parking lot, and a bunch of people gathered outside the entrance. We put down our name and were told to wait nearby. Luckily, we noticed a couple leaving the bar area, so we snuck in and found two perfect spots smack dab in the bar. WIN!  I started with a Pilgrim's Passion to calm the nerves and ease the appetite... Gin, St. Germain, passionfruit puree, topped with a sprig of fresh mint. So smooth, so fresh.   We ordered a plate of Mozzarella Caprese as the appetizer, which came with complimentary garlic bread. The fresh mozzarella with the EVOO drizzled on top was a perfect start to an Italian dinner. Paired with a glass of red and my cocktail, it opened up the appetite for a pasta dish.  We ordered the Melrose with shrimp... Linguini, creamy basil pesto sauce, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes topped with roasted pine nuts.  and... Eggplant Parmigiana with mozzarella, tomato sauce and side of spaghetti with tomato sauce. The dishes were huge, and we quickly realized that one entree would easily please two people.. but hey, we're in Vegas so we smashed down as much as we could.. but boy, was the Melrose heavy. The creamy sauce made it rich, and really heavy. It was so tasty, but I threw in the towel after 5 minutes. The Eggplant Parm was really tasty, with soft breading and basil tomato sauce, it was definitely our favorite.  The service was very inviting and prompt, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food and ambiance. It's definitely a place we would return to on our next visit in Vegas. And thanks to Philip T. for his awesome recommendations!",

I'm not a huge fan of seafood if at all so I stuck with the pasta dishes. They have so many classic options and twists on classics as well. I decided for chicken Marsala which was really good. One of the better ones I have had. I will say it comes with a side of pasta but it was weird that it came with red sauce on top. Typically when I order chicken Marsala the wine sauce is served over pasta. The garlic bread they bring out is outstanding and we could have eaten that for an entire meal. The dessert was good too, we got the chocolate lava cake. The vanilla sauce is just so good.",

The food was pretty good though, so I'm sure I will be updating my review at some point in the future to comment on the actual restaurant!  The food that we had catered was the Chicken Parmesan, Meatballs, Fettuccine Alfredo and Penne with Marinara.   The chicken Parmesan were smaller than I have typically had, but still delicious. I think it's because I am used to restaurants pounding the chicken flat and Nora's seemed to just cook the chicken breasts as they are. No big deal though as they were still flavorful.   The meatballs were average sized and also had a good flavor to them - lots of red sauce, yum!   The fettuccine Alfredo was great! The sauce was not to thick nor too runny - perfectly creamy and flavorful! The penne seemed a little dry to me for some reason though.   Overall I really enjoyed the food and am looking forward to stopping in for dinner one night!",

    "text": "Dined here on Feb. 22 2019  First thing, MAKE A &*(&ING RESERVATION. I couldn't find a parking space here b/c this place is BUMPIN'.  Dining experience: I was apart of a party of three and was told the wait would be an hour and 15 to an hour and 30. As we met the hour and 20-minute mark I went and asked the hostess how much longer/where we were on the list. Without even looking at her list she told me \"probably another thirty\". We waited about another 20 when we were finally escorted to the outdoor patio. If was freezing.  We were told that they could bring in another heater if it was too cold. I asked for one right away. I'm 6 months pregnant and they put us outside on a frigid night. The waiter came, made the comment of how cold it was and asked if we needed another heater. I asked for one. Still no heater. Drink runner came with drinks, commented on how cold it was and asked if we needed more heaters. I asked for another heater. Never got a heater.  If I would've known that asking when my party would be seated would end us as literally the only party out on the patio I would've kept my mouth shut and left. 6 months pregnant and out in the cold *check the weather for that night it was very cold*; nothing says awesome dining experience when your nose is running and frozen as you try to eat your pasta.  On top of that, their live band members were walking in and out of the zipper flaps to move in their equipment so what tiny bit of heat the patio would build up from their space heaters on the wall would just leave every few minutes. So needless to say my dining experience was the worst.  Food: AMAZING. I ordered a caesar salad and the Primavera. For that alone, I DO want to come back and try this again. Fingers crossed for a MUCH better dining experience and will definitely update review when I do.",

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and we were immediately greeted by the bartender Michelle, she was amazing and super friendly! Anyways we ordered the calamari appetizer which was very good. For our meals my boyfriend got some seafood pasta he said it was pretty good.  I got the shrimp scampi which was also really good. The portions here are huge, we had a lot of food left over but we didn't end up bringing it home with us since we had no microwave in the hotel room.  I suggest either coming here on a empty stomach or sharing a dish with someone.  We definitely plan on coming back next time we're in Vegas which will hopefully be soon!",

    "text": "Seeing the great reviews and my grandma and uncle's praises about the restaurant before my arrival led to high hopes for my visit here. I had actually been to Nora's twice in the past and remembered really enjoying it the first time but felt ambivalent in the second. However, I arrived at the new location and was really impressed by the new exterior and interior decor as well as just the overall increase in space of the restaurant.   Unfortunately, my experience as a whole did not mirror my expectations one bit. For starters, my grandma had informed me that she had made a reservation for 11 am on one of the days we were in town. Because we decided that we would rather have Italian food for dinner, I called and was told that there was no reservation for 11 ( and in fact, they do not take reservations for lunch! ). I'm not sure where the miscommunication took place, but not to worry since we were planning to go in later that night anyway.  We arrived right before our reservation time of 4 PM and were asked to wait while our table was getting set up. Not sure why it wasn't set up already, but no worries. Waiting for a minute or two is fine, of course. However, one minute turned into two turned into five turned into what seemed like at least ten minutes. No one seemed like they were in a rush to get us seated, which was a bit annoying. If that was the case, what was the point of making a reservation?  Finally, we were seated and all was fine. Nothing exciting took place between getting seated and getting our food ( except that the food seemed to come at a rather slow pace which was strange considering that the restaurant was mostly empty at this hour ). We ordered a Calamari Fritti, Truffle Fries, Shrimp Scampi, Frutti di Mare, Crazy Alfredo, and the Rib-Eye.  1) Calamari Fritti: This was actually really good. Perfectly crisped and flavored. Good sauce to go with the fried calamari. Would definitely recommend this. HOWEVER, when we were given the bill, they charged us $2 extra for this. The waitress told us that this was the price and when we showed her the menu, the prices did not match. It is fine if it is supposed to be $2 more; however, please update your menu to reflect the same. The staff did not seem to be pleased in helping us fix the error and, in fact, made us seem like we were a nuisance for asking for it to be changed. When there are pricing errors, it is not so much that the customer cares about the difference in price, but simply the principle that everyone is accurately charged for the food they are getting.  2) Truffle Fries: Overly salty and not very much truffle flavor. It's overall okay, but not the best that I've had. Wouldn't really recommend. The only reason I got it was because I had been craving it a few days back and was happy to see it for a decent price at a restaurant. Wish it would have satisfied that craving better.  3) Shrimp Scampi: I didn't have much of this but my grandma and uncle both ordered this and liked it. Too buttery for my taste and not salty enough ( which was surprising considering how salty the fries were ).  4) Frutti di Mare: Also not the best that I've had. Again the sauce was a little bland, and considering that this dish is usually very flavorful in other places, it was severely lacking that night. Not sure what could have been done to make it better. Definitely some more salt would have been a start.  5) Crazy Alfredo: This dish sounded amazing on paper ( and some of the reviews seemed to agree with that ), but I did not like it at all. The flavors didn't seem to marry well together, and it was too heavy ( which I suppose I should have expected with an alfredo dish ).   6) Rib-Eye: This was definitely the highlight of the entire meal. The meat was very well cooked and flavorful. If I had to go back, this would be what I would get. It's a bit confusing because the menu has an option with fries and another with roasted potatoes. The fries option is $1 more than the roasted potatoes, and that was not the one that we wanted, especially since we had just ordered a side of fries as it was! Nonetheless, out came a bowl of fries. Now, this is just what I've experienced at other restaurants, but usually, if a party orders fries, the waitress asks if we still want it since one of the entrees comes with a side of fries that's the same size as the one we paid for. This was never brought up, though they were at least accommodating enough to bring out a side of roasted potatoes instead ( which took another fifteen minutes at least ).  Overall, didn't really enjoy my experience here. To get the bill took what felt like eternity and our waitress just disappeared on us for most of the meal that we had to flag down other waiters who were confused as to where she was. In additioit seems the online menu and the in-restaurant prices do not match. I am not certain if it is supposed to, but it doesn't seem to be a reliable source. I don't believe I will be going back again sadly.",

    "text": "Last night, Saturday, My boyfriend, friend, and I went to eat at Nora's. I was excited to eat here and expected a lot. We walk into the restaurant and the new set-up is beautiful. I pass by the restaurant every day on Flamingo on my way to work, and the new location is much nicer, aesthetically, than the old one. So, I decide to take my friend here as a special occasion since she is visiting from out of town.   Anyway, this was our first time eating here. We had reservations at 8:30pm. We arrive at that time, and get seated shortly after. The hostess gives us our menus, and we wait for our server. We were right by the entrance to the kitchen, so there were many workers who passed us. No one came to greet us. At about 8:55pm, still with no service, we literally had to track down our server, who seemed reluctant to help us when we approached her. She didn't even acknowledge that we've been waiting. There was actually no greeting or introduction at all. Just, \"Can I get you something to drink?\". We ordered our drinks and food from her at the same time.   I ordered a Hitachino white ale, water, and angel hair pasta with arrabiata sauce and sausage. My boyfriend ordered a diet, water, crazy alfredo pasta, and a calamari appetizer. My friend ordered water and fettuccine alfredo.   After waiting for a bit longer, and still nothing on our table, the server came back to tell me they are out of the beer. So, I ordered a sangria. Meanwhile, my boyfriend goes to speak with the manager. He said the server is newer and he would expedite the order. After this, the food arrived in the following order: 1) my sangria, 2) only two waters, 3) the calamari, 4) the diet (after re-requesting), 5) the third water, 6) the complimentary bread, 7) the main dishes.   The food, itself, was tasty but nothing spectacular. I enjoyed it, but for the price - not worth it. The portions were decent. The food presentation was good. However, taste-wise, it was like any other Italian restaurant. I would say, the food rates a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Honestly, it wasn't something I would come back for, even if the service was good.   The service made this experience a poor one. When service is this poor, the manager usually does something about it. I was a server for years, and a comp of some type is usually offered to the guests. Nothing. After almost a half-hour, we had to sequester our server to come help us, and when we previously waved or tried to flag down anyone else, they ignored us. Most likely, because it wasn't their section. I mean, c'mon, at least attempt to rectify the situation by offering us a second round of already-free bread or something.   The restaurant was busy, and it was a Saturday night. However, there were a good handful of people, bus boys and servers, who were quick to clear a table once the party was finished. Like, I'm talking, immediately after guests left. So, busyness or lack of help was not an excuse for not assisting us.   Our bill came out to $81 for the three of us. I rarely ever leave less than 18-20% of the taxed bill. Last night, I made an exception. The food was okay. Service was terrible. I do not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Like I said earlier, I came to investigate the hype.  Unfortunately, the wardenis not a big fan of pasta so I had to go solo cause Yolo.  Not too mention, the place is pretty close to the office.  I opted for the gnocchi with vodka sauce after learning that crazy Alfredo is only offered at dinner.  Also. I been seeing gnocchi at at the world market and contemplated making it at the crib.  Because it primarily consists of potato and basically a dumpling, it is rather filling and pretty heavy.  The vodka sauce was excellent and the good came out in a flash.  Let's not forget about the fresh garlic bread....whoa!  My garlic gauge is enhanced so I love how they load it with butter, seasonings and garlic, and lots of it!  The server was very accommodating as well and assisted with activating the closed captioning feature so I could watch ESPN's Around the Horn.  There was a minor mix up when paying the bill however, where the waiter charged me for the couple eating next to me.  No biggie, but I sure can see others having a stroke over it.  I still broke him off as if the mishap never occurred.  The ambience creates a True modern Italian experience and the speakeasy lounge music was a nice touch.  The decor provided a cozy feel and the dining area is closed off to the world, giving you that presence of intimacy.   I am definitely coming back again, especially during dinner too complete my investigation of the do called \"crazy Alfredo.\"  Maybe I can convince my partner in crime to come with, but until then, it might be several solo dolo trips for muah only.",

(I think they may prefer reservations because they do seem to have a lot of clientele). Obviously I chose this restaurant due to a yelp search, yet it was the garlic bread pictures that won me over was looking for something traditional versus garlic knots. Only ordered a glass of malbec wine $10 and a house salad $8 and Arancini $8. Food came out quickly, literally 5 minutes. Yet I didn't receive my complimentary garlic bread for a bit, asked a waiter about it and then got it. Salad was very good and fresh tasting, not even a huge fan of tomatoes yet they were very ripe. The House Italian dressing was very tasty. The garlic bread was definitely just what I wanted, very buttery and tons of garlic on it. Can never have too much garlic in my opinion. The Arancini was flavorful but I do think maybe it could have  been a little warmer/hotter, and possibly deep fried just a touch more so that when they are laid over the tomato sauce they wont get soggy as quickly. They were slightly breaking open due to them absorbing the tomato sauce liquid. The server suggested a Malbec wine, it was indeed a very good choice. They staff was always around to take care of your needs. Would definitely come back if I'm near in the future.",

We ordered the red sangria that was really fine.  I'm not a big sangria fan so I wasn't expecting much.  I usually think of sangria as cheap red wine with soda.  I was pleasantly surprised that the sangria was made with good wine and beautiful fruit. Overall a very nice dinner.",

    "text": "Nora's is my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.  I've eaten in many times, picked up food and pizza to go, and recommended this place to many friends.  The restaurant is decently sized with two dinning rooms on either side of the kitchen & main room, adequately lit, and is warm and cozy.  The service has consistently been genuine and friendly.  For starters, the garlic bread is delicious.  I always have to remember to stop eating it so I can save room for my actual entree!  That and I don't want to smell like garlic on date night. The gnocchi and vodka sauce are a delicious combo.  I'm a meat and starch kind of girl, but that dish is so good on it's own I don't even need to throw in anything extra. The crazy alfredo is crazy huge and packed with so many ingredients and flavor.  This dish could probably feed two people. When it's a special, you MUST order the osso buco.  It's much more pricey than normal Nora's items (~$35), but it's soooo worth it.  It comes with a little spoon for the bone marrow, which is absolutely delectable.  This is my favorite dish in the world, and it nears perfection here.  If you're an Olive Garden/Carrabas/chain Italian restaurant kind of person, give yourself a well deserved real Italian meal and go to Nora's.  It doesn't disappoint.  Date night seal of approval!",

The restaurants on the strip are expensive and the neighborhoods tend to have strip mall national chain foods.  I thought Nora's might work out but it didn't.  The prices are high for the quality of the food.  Any place that uses pepper as the main seasoning may have a problem with the quality of the meat.  The service is dreadful.  We waited over an hour and ten minutes for our food.  I have never waited that long in my life for dinner.  The waiter disappeared so we couldn't find him to inquire as to the delay.  We were not offered even a drink or bread for our inconvenience.  And it is loud, crowded and cold.  We will not be returning.",

    "text": "Nora's is one of your not-so-secret neighborhood gems residing in a nondescript strip mall on the corner of Jones and Flamingo. it seems as if much as been written about this place and opinions vary. Mainly, it seems like an issue of expectations. So here is what to expect and you can decide for yourself if this is going to make your dining rotation.   Nora's is really the combination of two suites in a strip mall. The room to your right will have a band at 9pm on a weekend night offering smooth jazz or whatever is Italian restaurant appropriate. The music is not too loud and you can either enjoy the music in the background or sit nearer to the band if that is what you are there for. There is also a semiprivate room for about 10 if you are having a little party. The other dining room is just a dining room. I didn't eat there, so I can't really say what the experience is like.   Service. I will get this out of the way since this is where they lost a couple of points. The service was by no means terrible, as we were seated on time, food timely and drinks filled. It was just more of an intangible indifference I felt, as if I was not supposed to know about this place. Maybe everyone was in a bad mood because the night was cold and they were missing out on the Pacquiao vs Cotto fight. Or maybe you need to be a regular for a little warmer service.   Anyway, I just desire warm, friendly service with Italian food. It just seems appropriate with pasta. Just like I expect bad service from the best Chinese restaurant. Not a big deal, but this prevents this place from being remarkable.   The interior design is nice and they do good job of providing a good atmosphere. You will forget that you are in a strip mall.   Food. Obviously, that is what we are here for. Firstly, by no fault of the restaurant, I ordered the wrong dish. Rare mistake. However, having said that, I believe that carbonara should be a wee less salty. Granted, this is from the perspective of a guy trying to limit his salt for health concerns. However, it is rare that something is so salty that I cannot finish it. The first few bites were delish, but got increasingly harsh as time wore on. Personally, I think that the prosciutto itself would lend enough sodium to flavor the dish nicely, but they went overboard by salting up the sauce.   Shrimp scampi appetizer = good. Nice large shrimp, good sauce that goes well with the garlic bread. Speaking of which, the garlic bread was okay, with a home made kind of feel, if you like that sort of thing.   Dessert. Somewhat limited choices, but the tiramisu was satisfactory with a nice wet cake to it. Ladies should have no problems here.   Wine. An excellent selection of by the glass in case you are drinking solo or otherwise cannot take on a full bottle. Mostly Italians and California wines. You can go budget for $6. I got a couple of glasses of Regaleali for 8.25 each.   What you must compare all this with is the fact that most of your pasta dishes range from $10-20, dessert is $5 and tea is $2.50. The scampi is mildly pricey at $13.95, but it was still worth it.   I think it is unreasonable to expect some sort of mind blowing experience. Really, Nora's is a nice local restaurant for a casual meal with a lady friend or perhaps a decent group gathering. Good for conversation, a generous serving a pasta and perhaps a nice bottle of Italian red for a reasonable price. You can stroll in here with a sportscoat or dress more casually if you like (maybe leave the jorts behind, though). So don't expect the world and just have a good time.",

They sat us right away and I was expecting a nice Italian dinner.  The waitress was very nice, however, the food lacked completely.  My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I'm sorry to report that there was absolutely no taste in the food.  There was no garlic, no flavors that you would expect in a (expensive) Italian meal.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we were very honest.  I explained that there was no flavor in the food, to which she apologized.  She brought terimisu (sp?) out complementary at the end, but again, even that lacked flavor.  I hate to say it, but Olive Garden has more flavor, and we despise going there!  This is my suggestion - go to the grocery store, buy your own ingredients, buy a bottle of wine, and have a stay at home date with your partner.  Not only will it be cheaper, but the flavors you can create yourself will beat this restaurant any day.",

The dish was swimming in water, filled with chopped up clams (I bet it's not even fresh) and it was really really bland, no flavor at all! Worst clam linguine I've ever had!

The lady friend left about two hours ago for some errands. What that really means is a full manicure and pedicure.  So the gal pal finally gets home and we head out for some good eats. We waste about a gallon of gas before be finally decide on Nora's Cuisine. I've never eaten here before but I've heard good things about it.  We roll up around 8:15 and the place is pretty full. The hostess nicely asks if we have reservations. We decline. We were then told the wait would be about 10 minutes or so. After a brief glance around the room, I noticed a lot of empty tables, Hmmmm...? 10 minute wait?  We finally get seated and the hostess apologizes for the wait. She explains that the dish washer is not working at full steam (insert joke here) and the wait was more for the clean dishes than an available server. I am always willing to wait for clean dishes!  The menu looked decent for an Italian place. It has all the usual Italian fare one could ask for. You can pull up the full menu on their website. We finally decided to start with the Calamari Fritti and a simple Caprese Salad. My two friends both ordered the Shrimp Scampi and I decided to go for their best seller, the \"Crazy\" Alfredo.  The Caprese Salad came out first. We just wanted some greens, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese drizzled with a light olive oil. We got exactly that. It was simple yet very tasty. Next out was the complimentary garlic bread. We started gnawing on the bread when the Calamari came out. I'm so glad we squeezed the lemon wedges over the golden crispy fried calamari because, at least now it had some taste! Ouch! The side sauce that came with it was pretty bland as well.  Out came the main dishes. The Shrimp Scampi looked pretty good. My dish looked awesome as well. How can you go wrong with the best seller? Well... To be honest I didnt read the whole description of the dish.   \"Crazy\" Alfredo - This best-seller features the classic fettucine Alfredo piled with chicken, sausage, jumbo shrimp... (Honestly. I stopped reading here. I should of read on.) ...porcini mushrooms, domestic mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapenos.  JALAPENOS? Yes. You read that right. Now dont get me wrong. I love japapenos on my nachos or mexican food... But in my Alfredo? To be honest, it was too much. I picked them all out and it really did look like someone took a huge handful and tossed it in. Maybe I'm missing the 'gourmet taste' of it or whatever, but I can definitely do without it.  The dessert selection didnt look too exciting so we decided to pass on it. Our final bill came out to around $70 before tip. Overall just an \"A-OK\" meal. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. Would I eat here again? Sure. I'd give it another shot. Next time I'd try the pizza or another large salad.",

A little too much going on there. The pizza was good. Nothing will beat the East Coast. It was super dead and I was expecting the restaurant to be super busy!

Everything that was said here about the food is all accurate and True. The portions are huge, enough to be shared family style, a small salad for 1-3 can still feed 4-5.   Service was very friendly and generous. I made reservations ahead of time based on the reviews that it can get quite crowded, even on a week night, we were seated in the dining room where the room was full of families, women on a girls night out, couples, etc, the room was alive and buzzing.   Had a lovely glass of Dr L reisling which comes in an adorable little carafe. WIth an unfortunate helping of parmesean cheese garnished on the dish of one of my lactose intolerant dining companions, they were quick to replace the dish with a fresh bash of non dairy product .   We shared the antipasto salad and bruschetta and indivdually ordered the linguine with clams, baked ziti and chicken erbe fini.  I had the linguine with clams with the white wine, olive oil and garlic sauce, excellent dish, plenty of clams, pasta served el dente, was too much of a serving, that I couldnt finish.   We had also earlier ordered the chcocolate cake based on the numerous suggestions here and it was a great way to end a very hearty meal. The chocolate cake has pistachio bits and has a brownie like crunch to it, but very ooey and moist on the inside.   The only sad part of the evening is that we were so stuffed and knowing we were going to be heading out to a party later on and that we're staying in a hotel with no fridge, had no way to savor any of the leftovers the next day.   I've had many of good meals in Vegas during my trips there, however this is a kind of place you want to go to when you're wanting to go where the locals go and stay away from the pretentiousness and drama with some of the high end restaurants on the strip.

The big birthday bash was held at Nora's (a place my dad saw on the food network).  They seated all 40 of us on the bar side of the restaurant where we mostly took over the place.    Since our party was so large we had a preset menu all served family style.  Caprese salad, antipasti salad, garlic bread, calamari, pene with vodka sauce, eggplant parmigiana, chicken marsala, seasoned pork tenderloin with parmesan crusted potato wedges, tiramisu and canoli!  Oh my God I'm full just thinking about how much food I ate that night!  All that for $35 a person.  The food was excellent...especially the garlic bread, calamari, marsala, eggplant...ok all of it was awesome.    The service was ok, but considering the number of people they had to contend with, I won't knock off a star.  They didn't even mind when we set up the gigantic poster board display of Grandpa's past 90 years on top of their beverage service table and they let us decorate with birthday banners and trinkets.  They also didn't mind when my dad and uncle got into a brotherly wresting match and broke one of the sparkling water bottles on the beverage service table....they just came over and cleaned it up.    All and all it was a good time with good food and crazy company!  I would like to go back to Nora's to have the non huge group of people dining experience.  Plus I need to have more of that garlic bread, cause it was damn good.  Congratulations Grandpa on 90 years!",

Before this restaurant, I wasn't turned onto the idea of Italian food..but this place did it for me! The Pasta Fagioli was amazing and so was the Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce. I had absolutely no complaints.  The cannolis and the chocolate cake were great too. If you are in Vegas, its def a must.",

We wanted a locals place with good Italian food and Nora's blew us out beyond our expectations.  For starters we had an antipasto and minestrone soup.  Both were delicious.  For my entre I had veal scallopini, which was tender and delicious.  I love garlic and Nora's knows how to use it properly, not overwhelming, but definitely there to enhance the True flavors of the veal.  The ambiance and friendliness of the servers made the experience totally enjoyable.  I highly recommend this restaurant to any visitors who want to get off the strip with it's exhorbitantly pricey restaruants and experience the way Vegas really is.  Down home and offering quality restaurants at reasonable prices.",

The manager had to remind us in a very unprofessional way that we have to leave at the exact time because they have to prepare for the next party.   The food was excellent but the bad customer service from the manager down to the servers made our dining experience in this restaurant very unpleasant.

    "text": "I am writing this review as I enjoy leftovers from dinner earlier tonight.   The Nora experience ...ahh where to start... From the moment you step into Nora's you feel right at home.  The restaurant has this indescribable homey feel to it that just puts a person at ease. There are two rooms to the restaurant, without having made a reservation, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately in the room by the kitchen. Their ceiling is very unique and is decorated with Trinacria ornaments which is the symbol of Sicily. Our server was nice enough to give us a short history lesson...pretty interesting.   The garlic bread...ahhh the garlic bread...I could probably eat three baskets myself. So thin, crispy, and buttery....ahh AND GARLICKY...so delicious. The first basket is free and every additional basket is 2.50...which is smart of them because it is just that addicting. I can see people going off on the garlic bread and call it a day.   I ordered the Chicken Carciofi in attempts to be \"healthy\"....I figured that chicken breast can't be that bad for you...eh.  The order is served with pasta, fresh tomatoes, artichokes, and capers. The chicken was so moist and the flavors were just MMmmmMm...perfect...not to salty and just right. Pretty much blown away at first bite. Very generous portions, which explains why I'm stuffing my face with pasta at 1:30am... Such a bad idea blaghhh...Body will hate me for eating all these carbs before bed.  Friends got the rigatoni special and cheese raviolis which were great as well but I was pretty overwhelmed with my Carciofi to really enjoy theirs.  We also got the calamari and mozzarella sticks as appetizers, but I wasn't really impressed with either.  Really great Italian food at very reasonable prices without sacrificing service. Our server was very attentive and informative. I will definitely be back to try the crazy alfredo. It is probably a good idea to make a reservation next time to be seated in the main room.  Guaranteed to put you in a food coma.",

Horrible because we were there to celebrate a birthday. Based on experience I'd rate them a 3 because of the tiny salt and pepper shakers, I mean come on even Olive Garden has salt and pepper grinders on the table. Also their grated cheese is in those glass bottles that you would expect at a casual pizza place but not at a nice restaurant. They get a 4 because the food was good but I'm not in a hurry to go back.",

The food is amazing, the service is perfectly acceptable (especially considering they're usually packed!) and they have an excellent selection of food and drinks.  My favorite entree is the Frutti de Mare, but you honestly can't go wrong with menu selection. The Osso Bucco is phenomenal as well, although they only have it during the winter. For drinks, the cappuccino martini is wonderful, as is the sangria.   I love Nora's, it's absolutely a favorite.",

No Open Table and Nora's on-line website booking system unavailable.  Telephone call resulted in a \"we're not open message\" without any option to leave a message.  Repeat call resulted in a long hold for a live attendant to accept a reservation.  Reservation offered was 15-45 minutes adjacent to requested time, which I gladly accepted.  Arrived just a few minutes before our 6:45 reservation to a jam packed waiting area filled with mostly angry patrons.  Second sign I should have abandoned the reservation.  Checked in with the hostess and proceeded to wait 45 minutes beyond my reservation while witnessing two things exclusively:  #1, patrons simply abandoning their reservations and departing; or #2, patrons waiting 30-60 minutes beyond their reserved / promised time, while complaining amongst themselves and / or to the hostess stand -- all to no avail.  I've dined at Nora's many times in the past while visiting Las Vegas.  Things have changed for the worst and I won't be back.  I understand issues and circumstances arise.  Communication goes a long way towards mitigating unforeseen matters.  Issues / circumstances were not the issue, its simply they way Nora's chooses to do business.  Oversubscribe, overpromise, and under deliver are the new norm and this customer votes with his wallet.  Hostess sat us, 45 minutes after our reservation, without so much as an apology.  Loads of outstanding restaurants in Las Vegas.  Many of which appreciate your business and honor the very basics, such as a reservation time.  Nora's has run its course and we won't give them another opportunity to showcase poor, poor execution.",

Main issue was the food, the pastas were mediocre and didnt really have much flavor or anything worth raving about.

So tonight, we stopped by, which may not have been the best idea, given that it was Father's Day and they appeared to be slammed.    We were seated at the one remaining table outside.  Our waiter came right over and got our drinks quickly.  Appetizers (calamari and salad) took about 20 minutes to come out.  Our bread, which was promised about four times, arrived in about 25 minutes.  Our table was cleared and then, we  waited for our dinners.  Thirty minutes later, another waiter came to our table, as I guess we were just sitting there with blank stares on our faces, and asked if anyone was helping us.  At that moment, our food came out.  We were fried after sitting outside for an hour in the heat, even with their misters, and were tired and annoyed it took an hour for our meals to arrive.  We had them box it up, cancel our dessert, and we left, about 70 mins after arrival.  I couldn't stomach the idea of sitting there for another hour.  Or whatever it was going to be.   My husband order a chicken pasta dish, which he tasted and said was good.  I had the gnocchi and vodka sauce ($17.50) which tasted like...well, tasteless mush.  It literally had no flavor and the gnocchi waswater logged or something.  That meal was tossed in the trash, as it was completely inedible.  I wouldn't give that slop to my pets.  I don't think I'll give them a second chance.    Two stars for our waiter. who was at least friendly (although who would also disappear for long amounts of time) and the ambiance, which is really nice.  Minus three stars for the mediocre food and the ridiculous wait times.",

    "text": "I heard about this place on a local radio station. They were mentioning the top pizza places in throughout the nation. Nora's took first place and of course, being the pizza lover I am, I had to try this place. After finally planning our Vegas trip I said we had to try this place before we left to see if its really the #1 best pizza in the USA (San Diego took #2 woohoo). We got there exactly at the time they opened to beat the lunch crowd. At first it was empty, but immediately got packed for the lunch hour.  We already know what we wanted since we had browsed through the menu on their website. After being seated, the bus boy offered us water along with any other beverage. A few minutes later, our waitress greeted us with fresh garlic bread (Which was to die for!!) We started off with a Caesar Salad then ordered our pizza. We went for the Snow White pizza and added mushrooms and prosciutto (per hubby's request). I must say this is probably the best pizza I've ever had. The ricotta on the pizza was so fresh it would melt in your mouth. The dough was just perfect. Not too heavy, not too doughy, not too thin, not too thick. I'm usually not too crazy about prosciutto, its just too salty for me to enjoy, but this one was perfect!! It had the right texture, not too chewy or salty. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and I can totally see myself coming back if I'm ever in Vegas again.",

    "text": "I had eaten there many times with the same friend and after an absence of many months the two of returned. The waitress recognized us and gave a friendly greeting. I asked for chicken erbi fini and the waitress said it was no longer on the menu, but it would be no problem. So far so good.   When the chicken came it was a bit over cooked and I thought the spaghetti sauce not up to par, but it was still pretty good.   It was my friend's turn to pay and he gave the waitress his credit card. She returned and apologized and said since we hadn't been there in a while she would have to see his ID. My friend was not put off by this, but I was. I would have been very annoyed if that had happened to me, especially if I was bring someone there for business and they recognized me as a returning customer and still wanted to see my ID. I left not eager to return. WHEN I MENTIONED THIS CREDIT CARD ISSUE TO MY FRIEND MUCH LATER, HE TOLD ME THAT HIS WIFE INSISTS ON WRITING ON THE BACK OF EACH OF HIS CREDIT CARDS, \"PLEASE DEMAND TO SEE MY ID.\" So, I think what happened is that the waitress obviously didn't look at the back of his credit card, the cashier did and just told the waitress w/o explanation to check that customer's ID. This goes to show how it can be tough to please in a service industry such as a restaurant.",

    "text": "Mi familia and I rarely go out for Italian food. Mainly because my son only eats cheese pizza and my daughter angel hair with butter and Parmesan cheese. What? I'm gonna spend twenty bucks on that? Sorry kids, no. We're eating in.   But we were on vacation. My buddy read up on this place and convinced me to join him and his family. And I'm glad I did.   Yeah, the kids got cheese pizza and angel hair with butter. Man, are they REALLY my kids? When are they gonna expand their palates? But the rest of us went for it on the menu and I have to say I was fairly impressed.   The garlic bread they drop off at the table is warm, chewy and garlicky. Nice start. And they kept it coming.  Me loves that.  Lots.  Hands down best calamari I've ever had in an Italian restaurant. The accompanying sauce wasn't just boring ol' marinara, it was a nice, complex side that went well with the light and crunchy squid.   My buddy ate all the tentacles.  Solid house salad. Nothing amazing, but good, fresh ingredients and a tangy dressing.  Perfect soaked up with the bread.   The so-so. (There won't be a bad category). The chicken parm was on the small side. Good enough, but not outstanding. Don't order it. Same for the special veal chop. It looks impressive and the price isn't bad - 28 bucks - but it didn't make any of us at the table scream  \"Mangia, mangia!\"   The good. My son's cheese pizza.  Really awesome crust and blend of cheeses. And made for a good breakfast the next day. My wife had the pesto. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. And my linguine with clams? A ton of clams and garlic, nicely proportioned. I cleaned my plate happily.   I'm a former waiter and I have to say, the service was pretty good. Apparently, the night we went, the place got slow, so they let a few servers go. Then they got slammed. While we did have to wait, the waiter and bus staff kept their cool, never running around like chickens with their heads cut off. That showed professionalism and didn't ruin our dining experience.   Though on the flip side, why didn't the manager just call up a waiter? Tell them, \"Get your butt back here, we got slammed!\"   That happened to me back in the day.  Finally, the bill came. And considering all the food we had, I thought we got out of there cheap. We didn't drink much alcohol, but nine people were stuffed to the gills.   Grazie, Nora!   Ciao!",

We had reservations at 8 and did not get seated unit 8:45.  When we sat down it seemed we only had one waiter for the half of the entire restaurant.  Even though she was very friendly it seemed like they were very understaff. Never once got asked if we needed a refill or another drink.  Can not complain about the food however it was very delicious.  So all in all I probably will not come back due to the fact that it is a $20 cab ride and the service was not great at all.",

OK so the outside wasn't fancy, but as soon as you get in the doors you understand why people aren't scared to return. The interior is decorated very upscale, except for the white paper table cloths. Our party walked in around 6pm and the place was packed, already people waiting for tables to be seated.. As soon as you enter the restaurant a wall of deli shes garlic smells make your mouth water. As we waited the few minutes, we got to enjoy watching the cooks, cook in the kitchen, which is placed right in the middle of the restaurant. We got seated near the bar and got to watch all the locals sit down and wind down. It looked like they had some fancy martini's if your into that kind of stuff..   As soon as we sat down we were served a huge bowl of garlic bread, no extra cost. And they didn't skimp at all, I mean this was a huge basket of really yummy garlic bread. Our wait staff was on their game this evening, filling glasses of water, and refilling the garlic bread basket a few times. We also ordered a small salad for an app. The salad was no where near small, it feed the four of us.   We all ordered our food, someone got chicken Marsala's, another got the lasagna, and I got the Alfredo Carbon. The portion sizes where huge, and the food was great! We all had enough leftovers for a second meal, which we nicely boxed up. Nicely done Nora's! Still feeling stuffed! :)",

A few mos. ago we rec'd. lousy attention at a late lunch because the server was more enamored with the men at the bar than the room with only 3 full tables when we arrived.  Also, getting garlic bread appeared too much for her.  So, let's forward to yesterday when we said let's give it another chance...  Three of us arrived around 3:00 when the barroom was busy with a few parties, so we were seated in the main din. room.  We ordered house salad for 3, spaghetti & meatballs, pesto pasta w/broccoli & the rigatoni special.  And we waited.  And we waited for the main courses.  We had to ask for the garlic bread (good tasting).  The salad arrived with little frozen-like cheese niblets and we were very surprised the server didn't ask if we wanted Parmesan for the pastas, instead putting a little jar of it on the table.  All the food was decent & that's not the complaint.  The service is, once again, & we had the feeling the parties in the bar were  more important.  Unfortunately, Nora's has no happy hour, and drinks (at all times) are $7 for all beers, & wines starting @ 8.  So, though their prices for pastas are reasonable enough, they sure make up for it on the drinks.",

    "text": "Nora's has been on my list of places to eat for years now. I finally got the chance last night for a birthday celebration! Walking in, it has an old Tuscan feel to it. It's dimly lit, bar is situated in the middle, and it gets pretty noisy. Our server was great! I think his name was Don. He kept our drinks and garlic breadsticks full! Speaking of the garlic breadsticks...omg they are the best thing ever. And they're complimentary!   Onto the food!  Calamari: Yum! Fried and seasoned perfectly. It wasn't oily at all! I really enjoyed the sauce it came with. I'm not sure exactly what the sauce was but it tasted like a marinara and it was a nice change from the typical creamy, white sauce most other places give.   Grilled octopus: I wished it had more of that char taste I was looking for. The texture itself was nice but it wasn't the most flavorful dish. I would probably skip next time.   Lasagna: omg so. much. cheese! I did wish it had more meat sauce (l like saucy lasagnas). This is definitely not for someone who's lactose intolerant. But then again, who takes that seriously? Lol kidding.   Crazy Alfredo: I really enjoyed this dish! It has a nice kick of spice from the jalapenos. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the dish had the right amount of sauce on it.   Osso bucco: this was so tender! Comes with mashed potatoes.   Ribeye (came with truffle fries): We asked for it to be cooked medium and it was perfect! It had the nice char and wasn't chewy at all. It comes with a side of truffle fries which I am all about!   Most of the entrees could be shared, such as the osso bucco and crazy Alfredo. They're huge!   Overall I do recommend this place. It's nice that it's not on the Strip and the prices are reasonable. The food and service was excellent. Only thing I wasn't down for was the noise level. It gets LOUD. I found myself shouting a few times across the table...but I don't know if that's saying much because I generally have a small voice haha.",

    "text": "This is another one of my favorite restaurants in town -- again, I've come here many times but this is the first time I've actually written a review for it. Nora's is off the Strip, and yet it feels more intimate than most, like you're visiting family or friends for dinner. Little wonder why this place is always packed -- get a reservation if you can! And ask for Don, Anthony or Sebastian for your server for great service!  Anyway, I ordered some items that are different from my usual for the purposes of this review -- starting with the arancini. Crisp on the outside, fluffy and cheesy on the inside -- and with the marinara and basil, it's perfect. I also got the spinach and farro salad, which was also light and paired perfectly with the arancini.  Even if you don't order appetizers or salad, you receive some garlic bread at your table. It takes a while for it to arrive, but it comes out fresh and with plenty of garlic -- which I like since I like a lot of garlic on my garlic bread.  For my main, I got the pappardelle Luisa -- pappardelle pasta with sausage, leeks, sundried tomatoes and white wine cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and the sauce was surprisingly light! It was perfect for dipping the garlic bread into, as well.  Normally I don't order the dessert I got -- the spumoni -- but it was warm enough out that I wanted something cold. It was actually refreshing, and I could taste each different layer. The pistachios added some nice crunch to the sweet, as well.  As I said before, this isn't my first time here, nor are these my usual orders ( hello, mozzarella caprese, warm chocolate cake, and antipasto salad ), but this was just to prove that everything I've had at Nora's is delicious. It really just depends on what kind of meal you want or what you can or can't eat -- but there's something for everyone there, and I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!",

The tiramisu was not what i was expecting either a little on the smaller side so i personally wouldn't share that. But all that said still feel this is a great restaurant and I love the new location, the atmosphere is very classy.",

Price was reasonable. We'd go back again. I'd actually rate this 3.5 star. 4.0 star for food.   3.5 star for service since it took forever to get our waitress to bring out the birthday cake then our check.

Everything I tried  was very good, which make me feel like you cannot go wrong with anything you order there.

For dinner (yes, we ate more!), we had the Veal Parmigiana (amazing)and the Pork Tenderloin alla Siciliana. The pork was served with roasted potatoes and breaded, roasted tomatoes. In addition, we had the Alla Nora- baked spaghetti with eggplant, meat sauce, and pesto drizzled on top. We loved it. Yes, we ordered way too much food but we wanted to taste a variety of items.

The food is good but the service has been poor the last few times - they seem chronically understaffed for the crowds that they know arrive every night. They also somehow manage to rush you and yet make you wait at the same time which is no easy feat. Perhaps our waiter was new but after we declined dessert he brought our bill, even though we planned on having another cocktail and espresso. Portion sizes are generally too large with the exception of my Chicken Marsala which I swear was 3oz of chicken and about two mushrooms sliced up. I'm sure my lack of patronage won't effect their bottom line but because we eat out frequently I am often asked about places to go; sadly Nora's is off of my recommendation list.",

    "text": "Sadly my experience last night was not as I had hoped. I chose Nora's to get a visiting friend off the strip for some local flavor.  Now, this isn't my first time to Nora's, but it is my first time to the new location. The good: we changed reservation times a couple times and they were very accommodating, I requested a table outside, they gave it to me (though I waited a bit for it to be set and when walked to the table found that it was not set up). Wine-Great list of options!!! Top notch variety and selection. Ambiance-social, upbeat and warm. Now the bad-well not BAD-but \"off\": First waitress made a point of rebutting my stating they did a nice weekend brunch here-I'm sure her intention was good and did so to provide me accurate information, it's just how she did it... She then came back and said she'd be handing our table over to another waiter (ok?)-but offered to get our drinks...we gave her the order which was delivered by another waiter...just a bit odd. The food-normally, pretty good, last night not so much. We ordered the steak bruschetta to start-both of us tried \"sawing\" through the over toasted bread-and when trying to bite it-guaranteed trip to the dentist for a broken tooth. I ordered the linguini and clams-the pasta wasn't buttery and brothy like I think it should be and half of the clam shells were empty :-( Also, I had to ask for a bowl for to remove the clam shells from the dish once I had eaten them. Nearly half of my dinner was left on the plate and that's not like me! When we were finished we were handed the check and weren't asked if we'd like dessert... Like I said before, this was an odd experience at Nora's who I had always put in my consistently good bucket....last night they were removed and placed in the \"roll the dice\" bucket. Bummer.",

The one downside - it was super, super noisy.  They did not sound proof the restaurant well.    Our waitress was a bit busy too and did not come by as much as she should.  But the food was tasty and worth it.    i started with the House salad - Romaine lettuce, mozzarella, pepperoncini, olives, onions, tomatoes.  Good toppings, and you never can have enough cheese.  Mom had the Pasta Faggioli soup.  She said it was very  good.  Lots of veggies.  For entrees, I had the Chicken Carciofi - Bone-less chicken breast with fresh tomato, artichokes, and capers. Served with linguine.  Mom had the Veal Parmigiana - from the leg, served with spaghetti and tomato sauce. We both liked our meals.  They were good sized portions.  Good sauces, good cheese.  The garlic bread is good too.  Definitely a good family style Italian restaurant.  It is quite noisy and very busy but it was a good experience.",

Secondly,  their chicken ceasar salad was actually drenched with dressing, the chicken tasted so very good but had to drink water after every bite because it was as dry as sawdust. Finally the best meal at the table was the crazy alfredo and boy is it flavorful,  there are so many things going on it was just super tasty my only complaint about it was that the sundried tomatoes tasted like they had refrigerator burn, had to pick around them, bummer because it would have really complimented the meal.

My friend and I were seated promptly at our reservation time and both opted for a Strawberry Daze each since they were so good before. A beautiful batch of arancini came out on the house, and was quite delicious as well. While I was tempted to give the alfredo another go, I chose our server's recommendation of the Chicken Carciofi. Super delicious if you like the flavors of lemony capers and artichoke. I must add that the dinner portions here are huge, but I was happy to have leftovers to enjoy later.  Housemade tiramisu hit the spot to close out a great dinner. Staff was attentive, attractive, and kind. Atmosphere was upscale chill without a touristy Vegas strip feel, which I really liked. Cool environment for a nice date or just to catch up on the latest goss with a girlfriend without feeling rushed.",

There is no such thing as \"crazy Alfredo\" or \"spaghetti with meatballs\" in Italy. And you certainly never see a huge plate of chicken or veal parmigiana served with a massive pile of spaghetti on the side anywhere on the Boot. Nevertheless the place was packed as it surely appeals to the hungry masses looking to overeat for good value.",

The location is easier to see since it's close to the street. They have a nice outdoor seating area with misters. And there are benches inside and outside to accommodate guests waiting for their tables.   When we were seated, the first thing I noticed was the noise level. It was quite loud. Hard floors, high ceilings and open layout made it a little playground for all the sound waves! But it got quieter as people trickled out. The service was nice and attentive. Food came out in a timely manner.  We had the grilled octopus and calamari as appetizers. Both prepared well, but the octopus had more flavor. I had the Crazy Alfredo which I enjoyed because it was a touch spicy. I guess I was in the mood for a little kick! It had shrimp, sausage, chicken, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and jalapenos. Overall, a pleasant experience, but nothing that really stood out.   They also have a private room which would be nice for groups.",

I couldn't find it at first I was expecting it to be a bigger restaurant but I don't  judge.   We decided to grab some drinks at the bar first. Lemon drop, bomb. Rose sangria, bomb. Moscow mule, bomb. That witchcraft drink, don't get! made me grow some chest hairs!  Finally seated, our waiter was amazing and very good looking I might add. We started with calamari. Very good, the sauce it came with was to die for. I ordered the Veal Cannelloni. Oh my gosh it was one of the best things I ever tasted. I honestly didn't know what veal was when I ordered it but it was amazing! My friend got the Frutti De Mare which was amazing also. It had a very seafood taste to it very different from my Veal dish but I loved both.   They brought our tiramisu and a Canolli for my best friends birthday on the house. And that Canolli was heaven! It had pistachio crumbs and that just made it perfect. The tiramisu however, I've had better but doesn't mean it was good.  Must come back and I highly recommend!",

His replied was \"it can come from the kitchen, from people and anyone could bring this with him\", I was shocked by his answer and was really offended to see a manger who isn't willing to take responsibility for it, I feel bad for the owners who pay someone to take care of their place and instead they ruined it. He gave us the coffee on the house. It was really embarrassing and the way he treated us was really rude. Would never recommend this place or step foot here ever again.",

One night we had family in from out of town and had done the strip places and the local place we frequent and Nora's came to mind. We called and the recording strongly suggested reservations. Seeing that we were in the car with family heading that way we were concerned. When we got to the restaurant we were quoted an hour and a half wait. It was full. We put our name down and asked the hostess if she would mind calling us when we were closing in on our table. She said they normally didn't do that but she assisted us as a favor. We went to Sams and then she called shortly after. We got back and we're seated promptly.  The food ... is ... AMAZING DELICIOUS FRESH GENUINE UNIQUE ... I could go on.  It was moderately priced and worth the pricing. Service was top notch. Servers tag team all tables to ensure a smooth dining experience.  We will be back. Treat yourself and make time to visit Nora's.",

The food was wonderful and the prices were a welcome surprise from the high priced food of the strip. Nora's is a traditional, local Italian restaurant that serves quality, authentic Italian cuisine. The only bad thing was that we had to wait for our food for about 40 minutes. The chicken marsala was excellent, the garlic bread was perfect. A small band played background music, which was nice and not overly loud. It was so nice that the people sitting around you and having dinner were speaking Italian. You feel that you're in the right place.  So if you're looking to get off the strip and the high strip prices, Nora's is a very good choice.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is delicious and truly authentic in terms of Italian taste. The decor is nice, waiters dressed lovely. I must say however,  as a resident and frequent visitor of the restaurant it is extremely busy so beware of wait times to exceed 2hrs. In addition during these busy times the front door host staff really struggle with the intensity of the traffic and tend to be really rude, short, curt and out-right offensive. Instead of greeting you or welcoming you to Nora's what you will tend to hear as you step up to the host is \"the wait time is.....\" in the most frustrating tone imaginable. I spoke with the manager on duty in one of these instances who apologized and explained it was really busy which I understood and advised him that good customer service can never be undermined despite the greatest of food. I am a local and choose to come here also during the slow times of day when Nora's is pretty empty and tourists are out enjoying Las Vegas therefore my money and my business really matters. He again apologized and explained he would speak with the hosts. You decide, if you come in the evening between the hours of 6-10pm expect chaos, long wait times, limited seating as you wait, rude hosts and great food.",

The meals were outstanding and since my daughter is vegan, they added more vegetables to her meal instead of meat. We will be returning here the next time we take a trip from Los Angeles.",

    "text": "Nora's is a hard place to describe.  One thing I can say for sure - Nora's is very, very popular.  It recently moved from a strip mall location to a large, stand-alone building down the street, and even this larger space is packed every night.  Beyond that, I don't know if Nora's set out to be all things to all people, but it very nearly succeeds in reaching that goal.  Is Nora's a local hangout, family-friendly, with reasonable prices?  Yes, it can be.  My wife and I are locals, a couple of miles from Nora's, and we consider it to be a neighborhood joint.  You can get a lasagna or cannelloni for about 15 bucks, and leave full and satisfied.  (One thing about that family-friendly part - there are usually families with young kids in the dining room, and not all of them are, shall we say, well-behaved; so it can be kind of noisy in there.)  On the other hand, is Nora's a high-end, destination restaurant that draws tourists from the Strip?  Yep, it's that too.  And if you want Nora's to be a $$$ restaurant you can certainly start with the shrimp scampi appetizer at $17 and then have the veal chop at $40.    My recommendation is to go with your favorite pasta dish.  Most recently, I had the Crazy Alfredo, which is sort of a paella made with fettuccine instead of rice, and was quite good.  I have also enjoyed the veal cannelloni a la vodka, and the fettuccine carbonara.  All of the pasta dishes I have tried have been rich, rich, rich, even for Italian food, so you definitely don't need multiple courses.  But if you do choose a starter, I would suggest that you stay away from the pasta faggioli - that was a dish I didn't care for.",

We ordered the a bottle of wine, veal cannolini a la vodka and the chicken marsala.  The old Nora's had the best chicken Marsala in the valley in my opinion and I am from a small town in upstate NY where they have some of the best Italian food in the US.  The wine was awful.  We didn't even finish it, but I blame myself because I chose it.  The veal was mediocre, but the chicken marsala was very dry.  I sent it back and was very quickly brought a new plate.  This was also very dry.  I choked down what I could because I was hungry.  The side of pasta was a saving grace.  Anyway I will never be going back to Nora's.",

I recommended Nora's and couldn't be more proud I took them here. They absolutely loved it. Customer service was great. There was a wait but it went by so fast! On Fridays and Saturdays they have a live band playing music which I find ideal! Oh and their red Sangria is REAL sangria. Tastes strong but delicious especially if your trying to feel good =)",

The sauce was brown, and bland. It was not the fresh red sauce we used to get.  We are both literally, and figuratively sick to our stomachs.  Both of us are sick now.  I've been burping up the sauce, and we both had deuces wild, if you know what I mean!  I had been going to Nora's for more than 20 years!  NEVER again!  Disgusting!  I should have gone to Roma on Spring Mountain.  We paid dearly for that mistake!",

We wanted the lunch portion of the Linguini and Clams which was priced at $9.95 on the online Lunch Menu at the time of the order. However, while placing the order via the phone, the hostess on the line said that there was no lunch size for the dish. I let her know that she should ask management to take that off the menu to prevent further confusion. After picking up our food and driving back to our hotel room, we noticed that the Shrimp Scampi had no linguini! It only had shrimp and sauce! We called to let them know, but all they could say was that we could go back for another Scampi dish. We would have liked a refund since the dish was $19.95. Unfortunately, our flight was later that day and we could not make it back to the restaurant. Hopefully they update their menus online soon to make sure the price of all of their items are accurate.",

Always on top of things. The 2 male bartenders can't keep up and will walk past an empty glass or empty bread basket until you ask. I specifically asked if I could get a dish with marinara sauce instead of meat sauce and he assured me I could. Came out with meat sauce. He offered to change it but meanwhile my husbands dinner gets cold. The food is normally very good no complaints about food!",

We were very satisfied and my only regret is that we didn't have a refrigerator in our hotel room to bring home leftovers (hugs portions!). We made a reservation (highly recommended) this place gets packed. There is a bar to get a drink in case you need to wait for a table. We started with the bruschetta (very delicious) and salads. Word to the wise: the small size portion of yet salad is plenty to split between two. I ordered the carbonara which was so delicious. Lots of prosciutto and the sauce was perfect. We also got yey chicken Milanese. This is the only reason I don't give a 5 because the Milanese wasn't great. Not pounded thin enough at all. Got the Oreo tartuffo for dessert. Def try it!  Parking can be challenging. We had to drive around the lot a few times before finding a spot. We will def eat at Nora's again when we are in town.",

(yelp check in FREEBIE: buy one sangria or house wine, get one FREE!) the bartenders were pretty annoyed that we all used the app to get the freebie, but no shame. the sangria is great! the white one was much more refreshing, but i preferred the slightly richer red wine  pros: - service: we had a very large party, but the server was great. he tried to keep on top of things as much as possible, despite having to juggle so many of us - FOOD: everything!!!! i ate was so tasty and delicious - live music: when we went on a friday night there was live music in the bar dining area. i cant really remember what kind of music they played, but it was relaxing and nice... but, due to the loud music, it may be difficult to have a conversation with your date if youre sitting in the bar dining area - prices: very very reasonable for all the food offered  cons: - only 1 bathroom for each sex. i was there for a few hours, and every time i went to the restroom there seemed to be a wait.   would i come again? sure!",

Salad had a pretty good serving size for the price. It was good, but just had a tad too much dressing. The flavor was delicious though.  The puttanesca had lots of flavor in it. I liked the crunchy green olives that were incorporated in it. My bf liked the pizza a lot but it was just average for me. I've tasted something better. The pizza had ham, artichokes, black olives and mushrooms. I was not a fan of their pizza crust.   The service was pretty slow for a Thursday night. The restaurant was probably 75% full.   All in all we will probably be back since I wanted to try their antipasto salad and Alla Nora. Saw those from the other table and it looked pretty delicious.",

Bernadat was our server (thats how it was spelled on the receipt, so sorry if it was spelled wrong), and she was super amazing and a doll.  She was super attentive.  We started with the Noras salad (nothing special), but it was good.  He got the baked chicken parmigiana and I got the chicken alfredo.  He really enjoyed his chickem parmigiana, and the best part it was fried.  It was pan seared in a pan and the sauce and cheese got put on after.  Just different and super delicious.  The alfredo was delicious, but I didnt care for the chicken so much in it.  I did order a side of meatballs, (this was just ok, I wouldnt order it again)  We also ordered some drinks that the servers had made up, its in the cocktail menu on the first page.  He ordered the toasted coconut which was AMAZING and I ordered the pilgrims passion, it was super good as well.    We ended the meal with a tiramisu, which was ok.  Other then that, service was great.  Everyone knew where to be and when to be.   The 2 hostess seemed a little lost, but that didnt ruin anything.    I would like to sit on the east side of the restaurant next time we come.  It seemed a little more quiet and intimate.",

If the sauce is plain or has nothing memorable about it then fahgettaboutit.  So steps in boring Lasagna and (non breaded?) Chicken Parm so bland that I'm pretty sure I could make it myself. My GF and her mom had the clam pasta dish and neither raved about it, finished half or asked for a to-go box. Afterwards me and my gf went for drinks and then... secret pizza; if that says anything. This wasn't the worst meal ever, especially with the lemon thyme drink, but I wouldn't go back here with so many other options in Vegas.  0/2 -service -prices (expensive) -atmosphere -food quality  +the \"Lemon Thyme\" drink was good +proximity to the Palms (lol)  Ok had to say at the end that this place stays packed and theres alot of great reviews. But I seriously tried twice people! Twice!!!   Maybe its just me",

She went above and beyond to make sure we had an excellent experience. I highly recommend Nora's to any local residents and/or out of towners. (And ask for Nina!)",

    "text": "I'm am shocked this place has an average 4 stars. We were highly disappointed, the only things that saved the night was the free glass of wine with Yelp check in an $10 off coupon I got for my birthday.  Not to be a nit picker but my food wasn't up to par so I might as well complain about the dirty with sauce table cloth as well. Otherwise the restaurant itself was nice. Lots of room, it really filled up the longer we were there. Our waitress was average, she helped with questions but otherwise wasn't very attentive.  We were given some small pieces of complimentary garlic bread to start, it was average, nothing special about it. I'm a big fan of Arncini, so we ordered a plate to start. Ick! I ate one and didn't even want to finish that one. It had good crunch but the taste of the inside was not appealing, I make Arincini at home and have had it many other places and this was the worst I have ever had. We didn't even finish them or the bread and my husband is a bread fiend.  On of the menu items I saw had gotten lots of good reviews and states its a best selling dish was the Crazy Alfredo, I love Alfredo and wanted shrimp but also wanted to try something different so I ordered it. The dish was piled high but it didn't seem like Alfredo sauce, it was more like they threw Parmesan or mozzarella in the pasta, it actually started to harden as it cooled. The spice of the jalapeno wasn't over powering which was nice. Disappointed there were only 2 shrimp in the dish. Tons of sausage. The fettuccine tasted like box pasta. My friend got the same dish and was disappointed as well. Her husband was the only one that was pleased with his dish which was the Chicken Mount Etna. My husband got the Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce and added Chicken. OMG! I felt so bad for my husband, his gnocchi tasted like wet balls of wall paper paste, no taste, and the sauce did nothing to help. We've had gnocchi before also and these were very heavy and gross.  I just wanted to get out of there, I can't believe I wasted by birthday dinner on Nora's, I will never go back or recommend it. My husband wanted to give me to give 1 star but my dish was at least edible.",

Their complimentary garlic bread is amazing, do request for cheese on the top for extra, it will make it even better. But I am not really a big fan of pasta that they give us. Seafood pasta - I am not a big fan of seafood, happened to try that because my girlfriend loves seafood, she said that it was good.  Gorgonzola & Mushroom pasta (forgot the name sorry) was really unique in flavor, it was really flavorful with interesting tastes.  Chicken parmagiana - Chicken was really tasty, I don't know if it was not supposed to be crispy for the chicken part, but what threw me off for this pasta is, it is not really flavorful, no tastes into the pasta by itself, it was very plain in my opinion. Tomato sauce was not very special at all, I felt that it tastes like a spaghetti sauce that you maybe able to get at Walmart. I guess I just chose the wrong menu.   If I include everything to rate this place based upon my experience, I would still give 5 stars, great atmosphere with amazing staffs. Just needed to choose the right menu. Price is reasonable too, so I would definitely come back to this place every time I am into Italian Food.",

Took all the ambiance out of the experience.  We ordered a bottle of wine and waited over 15 minutes for it to be opened and poured.  Our server was very unconcerned about us and barely looked at us the few times she stopped by the table.  We had better service from the bus boys who really tried to help.

Was greeted right away and informed us of a 15 minute wait. However, they were able to get seated in 5 minutes, so that was a plus.  The ambiance and decor is classy and charming. The wine room with the ceiling to floor window is their highlight. Wine barrels repurposed for the chandelier lighting over the bar area was clever and unique. The wine menu was made of cork. How appropriate! With all this attention to detail, I was a thrown off by the butcher paper on top of the dining table. I know some Italian restaurants have them and give you crayons ( if you have kids? ) to doodle on, but we didn't and they were kinda in the way. The paper was folded into half and it made the table uneven in parts so I had to move my drink to the more level part of the table. There is a white table cloth underneath it, so it would have been nice to do without the paper overlay.   Server was very prompt and friendly. Complementary garlic bread came out first. It was soft, had real chopped bits of garlic on it, and buttery. Yum! Was hoping the rest of the meal will just be as good. Ordered the fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, and mozzarella sticks. Mozzarella sticks were safe. The garlic marinara dipping sauce was above average. The fettuccini alfredo was very basic. It needed salt and was swimming in butter. Felt that it should of been creamier. It could of been better. Spaghetti and meatballs was underwhelming. Meatballs were moist, but needed more seasoning. The sauce didn't have a robust flavor that comes from a low and slow cooking methof at all. The red sauce actually looked very plain. No flecks of Italian seasonings or pepper in sight. These 2 dishes are simple, but when done right it can be amazing and these were not. It was simply just ok.   The atmosphere is upscale casual. Details in decor are thoughtful and chic. Pricing is very reasonable. Would be good for a first date without breaking the bank or to watch a game at the bar without the rowdy crowd of a typical bar. May give this place another try in the future.",

We ordered a lot of things on the menu . The sauce tasted terrible I literally could not even eat it. That night I was waring a brand new polo shirt $50 shirt. The waiter was serving a table near me and spilt a whole cup of coke on me with no apology. They ruined my brand new shirt and did not offer to get me a new shirt or any type of compensation for my damaged property, even tho my family racked up a 300 bill for food that was horrible. Food is disgusting to say the least. I would not recommend this place... stay away.",

This place was actually the first restaurant recommended to me by an Uber driver when I moved to Vegas over a year ago, and at that time it was still in the little strip mall up the street. It was my favorite then and it is my favorite now.   The food is to die for. There really aren't even words to describe how perfect this restaurant it. The quality, for the portions for the price cannot be beat and you'll always go home with leftovers that still manage to taste as delicious as they did hot out of the oven!   The wait staff was professional, knowledgable and attentive and the food came out hot, well-plated and absolutely delicious. (Although I almost could've dined on the pre-dinner garlic bread alone!)   My one and only complaint was that, when I made my reservation online, I specifically put in the notes asking for a \"quiet table,\" or one with a nice view, as this was a (very promising) First Date. To my disappointment, the Hostess placed us right by the door and next to a party of 8. Fortunately, they arrived towards the end of the meal, but the restaurant was not packed and it was a shame my request could not be honored, or even acknowledged.   Not to worry, the date still went very well, and I'm sure we'll be back for another one in the very near future!",

But I hadn't been back in a long time because it is far drive from where I live. I found out they moved into a nice larger building so I was anxious to go, so I talked my family to take me for my birthday. I had heard they were quite busy and should make reservations, so we did. And good thing cuz they were very busy. We got our table and it was very loud in there. Could not hear any of our conversations we practically had to yell at each other.   The service was fine and it was nice they gave me a free dessert for my bday. But the food, was just average. I got a steak. Wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. My husband got the chicken marsala. It was kinda strange that everyone else's meal was pretty good size but his chicken was small and dinky. And the side of pasta was as bland as could be. This is an Italian place. Shouldn't it be amazing.? My husband did love his old fashion though.   So bottom line... it's just not worth the drive for me. There are 2 amazing Italian places near me that I would rather go to.",

There were 5 of us for this visit. We all ordered wine from their great selection and all were great. Our server was FANTASTIC! Very knowledgeable about the wine and dishes and most accommodating to all our requests. The food menu is great with a wide variety of Italian dishes  sure to please everyone. We all ordered different dishes and all were perfectly cooked and presented. Very generous portions as well. Very nice dessert menu and the cheesecake was perfect!! A must visit for us on our next Vegas trip!",

We made a reservation for 7:15pm and were seated promptly. The server immediately came over and asked us for our order, I thought that was a bit bit strange as we had just sat down. I ordered Wild Boar Pappardelle. I've had this dish here once before and it was just as good if not better than the first time. We also ordered Pasta a la Nora and spaghetti with clam sauce. They were busy (as always) and I felt they weren't as mindful as they usually are, but the only thing that seemed to suffer was a delayed drink refill.   The one thing that rang out to me was that this new location was much louder than the previous one was. From what I recall the decor seemed a bit softer in the old one, and this one is more bare and the sounds seem to overtake the location and I could barely hear my dinner mates sitting right next to me. Overall it was still a enjoyable meal and night out.",

Regretfully because of our recent experience we will not be going back-ever. We ordered the calamari appetizer which the server brought to our table. The dish wasn't hot, it wasn't even warm, it seemed to have gone from the refrigerator to our table. The server apologized and when he returned with it, yes it was hot but it tasted like it just came out of a deep fryer. Now the main dish. My fruiti  de mar which is one of there signature dishes was just a plate of spaghetti with two mussels, and two or three shrimp. It use to contain an ample amount of seafood including calamari. Very disappointed. My husband's dish of veal parmigiana was just run of the mill. Too bad, we use to love this place.",

Browsing Yelp for what is open in mid afternoon, I found Nora's, and decided to try -- thanks to Yelp I've found a great new choice.  I had the arancini appetizer -- quite good -- and then the baked ziti (recommended by the server).  My iced tea was never empty, and finished off the meal with a great cannoli.

I've seen so many smaller restaurants ruined by \"upsizing\".  Unfortunately it happened at Noras too.     First the new location, while beautiful was horribly designed from a noise perspective.  You literally cannot hear people across the table from you...when I leave I sigh in relief because the din of the dozens of conversations at once has ended.     I mentioned this on my first dining at the new location to the manager... I work in the studio sound business and I recommended Paul Tan or Acoustic consultants.    I noticed this trip one wall has tapestries on it, but they need some Rockwool (Roxul) or sound soak behind them.   We're not talking a bunch of money here....a few thousand bucks for a noticeable reduction in noise.   Though if they really did it right, it could cost close to $25K for maximum reduction  Nora's, the noise IS hurting your business.   Once the newness of the new location is gone...people like me may not come as often.    I love your food please call an acoustic consultant... you'll get 2 stars more from me if you do.",

Even at 5:30 the place was packed.    Everything was delicious - from the antipasto salad we shared (the regular size was plenty) to the individual meals we all selected.  Chicken marsala, shrimp scampi, alla nora, spinach cannelloni, and linguini and clams were all fantastic.  Let's not forget the garlic bread.  Wow!  Every one of us took a box home and were too full to indulge in dessert.  We did have a couple glasses of Moscato d'Asti, Tintero \"Sori Gramella\".  It was great.

I have had this restaurant on my bucket list for years to try and it did not deliver. We were a party of four and we decided to order many different dishes with hopes of taking leftovers home ( thinking that the food would be well worth eating twice)   - first thing we received complimentary bread toasted with \"butter\" and herbs. Tasted artificial - not fancy at all.  -Calamari was ok, a bit greasy, sauce was tasty  -Pizza was ok I guess, nothing special  -Lasagna was a huge disappointment- it's dry and the meat was questionable???  -Chicken parmesan bland, no flavor!  -Pesto pasta with chicken and vegetables needed salt!!   Mind you it's not a very pricey restaurant but it's still around $20 a plate...not to mention $14 for a glass of house Cabernet not out of a bottle but out of a tap??? Seriously I saw them filling my glass out of a tap - like beer! I couldn't believe it! I wanna say it's a first and last time for me...",

Crazy Alfredo brought back nostalgia from back in the day of having it at Mac Shack. However unlike Mac Shack, Nora's Crazy Alfredo made use of pickled jalapenos instead of fresh, which overpowered the taste of alfredo sauce. The portion I got was good enough for two meals!  Also heads up they have a band playing and the noise level inside the restaurant was really high! I had to shout to talk to my friend on my side, let alone across the table!",

After we tried the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and the Farm House Carbonara, both were cooked perfectly and very tasty.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Just to be totally upfront: I took a star off because the person who was in charge of refilling waters was fairly OBSESSIVE. I couldn't take a single sip of water without them being there within 60 seconds to refill my water. A little breathing space would have been nice.   Walking into Nora's, it's clear why this place is so popular. It's beautifully decorated, with a separate bar area, individual private dining rooms for groups, and a stylish feel. I wouldn't call it intimate, but it does seem like a great date spot!  We were seated within just a few minutes of arriving, but it wasn't busy at all. We were there before the dinner rush that I'm sure this place gets. I ordered a small salad before my meal, but even with the \"small\" it was so big that I had leftovers for the next day. I ordered chicken piccata and my boyfriend got the lasagna. My chicken piccata was so good! Flavorful, perfectly cooked, and served with pasta. The lasagna portion was huge!!! He couldn't eat the whole thing even though it was really good. They also serve complementary garlic bread with your meal, which was delicious and they were kind enough to give me some to take home with the leftovers.   The service was good, though overwhelming as previously mentioned. The server was friendly and professional, and thankfully maintained a normal check in schedule. The water person was way too much though and eventually just annoyed us.   Overall, a great experience at a good price. I'd like to back for sure!",

I was ready to go somewhere on the strip as I had several recommendations but I checked Facebook and someone just posted to go to Nora's and that it was a Lyft ride from the strip. I took their suggestion and very glad I did.  It was definitely my best dinner while in Las Vegas. I started with a glass of wine the garlic bread and a salad then lasagna. At first I thought the salad had too much dressing from the appearance but after eating it, it was perfect and so fresh and delicious.  The garlic bread was an added accompaniment to the salad.  Then came the lasagna. OH MY FREAKING GOD!! It was amazing. Now I know why my friend said they choose LV to travel to in order just to come here.  I will definitely be back the next time I return to LV as it is bookmarked in my Las Vegas collection. Make sure to take the time and eat at Nora's when in LV.  Thanks!!!",

To top it all they do not serve fresh grated parmesan once the meal is on the table.  Bummer! We were given stale geated parmesan cheese in a glass jar.",

The waiter was friendly, again,  busy so he was in and out and doing what he does, not a lot of personal interaction as with the bartenders. I orderd the Chicken Erbe fini - spaghetti with herbed chicken breast. Spaghetti was good, good red sauce, not watery and full of flavor. The chicken was a little dry and not as much flavor as I would have liked. My date ordered the lasagna and after sampling some of that, I should have ordered the same. Hearty, full of flavor, strong cheese flavors, the meat sauce was excellent. Baked of course, and very rich. The garlic bread was good as was the mozzarella sticks, both served piping hot and a great way to start the meal",

If you want Italian food better than this you can find it at Parma 's  all day long. But make a reservation if more than four.  I'm Italian  - ate it all my life - don't set your expectations too high if you must eat at Nora's   Just because people say 3 generations of business doesn't always mean its good - I know some real shitty plumbers that have been in business longer!",

The smells are outrageous and enough to kick the salivary glands into high gear!  On my most recent visit (4/19/14), I ordered the snow white pizza with prosciutto on top.  The pizza was delicious and the crust was perfectly crispy and very tasty.  I also ordered the Rigatoni Nora and the Baked Rigatoni.  Everything was delicious...I'm still dreaming about the leftovers from the next day and how good they were!  Next time, I intend to take some friends with me and eat in to truly enjoy this excellent restaurant.",

Though quite heavy, the taste was marvelous. You can't go wrong with their Crazy Chicken Alfredo, as well as their Four Staggioni Pizza. Great ambiance, and a nice and fully stocked bar.

The staff is kind and attentive and they really make you feel welcome.  The last two years we've gone, we've ordered their famous Oreo Tartuffo dessert which is a cookies and cream scoop of ice cream covered In chocolate shell with Oreo cookie crumbles and I think there's even some mousse with it too!

Could be that the server forgot to ring it in OR the kitchen crashed. Whatever the case, it's not exceptable.  My other issue was too many tables crammed into the restaurant. There is not enough room for that volume. The table next to us had 10 people around what should be a table for 6 MAX. One poor woman was right in the walkway with barely enough room to walk past her.  I was quoted 45 min to a hour wait...that was more like 20 minutes. (Maybe she ment  the food would take 45 minutes.) Quote times should be more accurate.  VERY disappointed a manager or key wasn't walking around checking on the guest or was even sent to our table, my body language spoke volumes of how upset I was getting. I've worked in the F&B industry for 25 years, and I can say, I've had a better experience at an Applebee's and that's 1 step up from fast food. I may give it another shot because the food was GREAT....when it finally got there. I will also make sure I make a reservation, even on a Wednesday night.",

We thought the new somewhat larger location would alleviate the wait problem, but I guess they just can't get organized. We may not return because of this.  After waiting with a crowd of people who had no reservations, near the door which was continuously cold & uncomfortable, we were finally seated last evening.  Still, until I saw that the manager (who was at the bar with other patrons) happened to notice that we were sitting there without water, bread or anyone acknowledging us or coming to the table,  a waitress magically appeared.  That was about 10 minutes.  To top it off, after the long uncomfortable wait, we were seated near a large noisy birthday party - a few of them were actually toasting above my husband's head.  I was waiting to see if they'd spill wine or food on him. - Private Parties?  Make them take a private room.  So, we'll give it one more shot because of the food and  as usual I will make reservations.  If it continues that they can't alleviate the uncomfortable long waits, we will avoid coming here despite liking the exceptional food.",

    "text": "I have read all the reviews on Nora's since they have re-opened at a new location and so I decided to try it.  Used to go to the old location and most of the time it was OK....   Went there last night and I'm sorry to say the food wasn't as good as it should have been.  The Chicken Marsala was OK, nothing special, tasted the same as all the Marsala dishes I order at other Italian restaurants, nothing special to set Nora's version apart.   Also ordered the Eggplant Pizza which was terrible, the egg plant was burnt and the pizza crust was un-chewable, sent it back and ordered the Eggplant ala Nora without the Pesto on it.  Again the eggplant was overcooked so it tasted burnt which isn't exactly a treat, and it was just an average dish of spaghetti with sauce and then topped with burnt pieces of eggplant.   The food isn't fantastic, it is just regular Italian food you could eat anywhere and pay less for.  I don't go to a restaurant because the building is new, that is not what I am paying for, I am paying for a fantastic dinner and I didn't get that.  It was below average but priced above average.  More detail should be given to the quality and preparation of the food.   It wasn't worth my going there because I didn't enjoy myself nor did my companion and we had terrible indigestion for the better part of the evening after dining there.   There are many Italian restaurants around town that can compete with Nora's and the food is more enjoyable, prepared correctly, and not as costly.   I don't understand all these great reviews because I looked at the food coming out of the kitchen (not just what I ordered) and it didn't look like it was anything special.  I just think people are so used to going to Nora's that it becomes a habit and they go not for the food but because they are used to going there.  Sorry Nora's, your new building is pretty, but I think the quality of your food need improvement!!!!",

When I told her we didn't have a reservation she kind of got an attitude. Granted we arrived at 6 pm on a Friday night, but still... The place was EMPTY when we walked in. She told us since we had no reservation we could sit at a tiny table next to the pizza oven area or a hightop table next to a stage. We opted for the stage table and luckily, no band played while we were there. Even though they got busier while we were there, there were still plenty of tables, and no need to be treated like we couldn't be served due to no reservation. After my husband talked me into not walking out, we enjoyed a nice meal and a really nice server. While nothing completely blew me away, (Let's face it, Vegas is not known for its Italian food) the food, price, and our server were good enough that I might go back again.

Great service, amazing wine selection and full bar. I am always nostalgic when the sons were servers and Nora'was in the kitchen cooking long before they expanded twice.  I miss the 4 tables they used to have but happy they are doing so well now. A place you have to try. If you don't like Noras you don't like Italian food.

Especially since \"this is where all the chefs go to eat\", as per the Food Network.  We wanted to order the pasta puttanesca but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.  So it was fried calamari, some kinda fried risotto balls with saffron, and the aforementioned pork chops.  The calamari was typically mediocre, the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  The risotto balls were decent, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.  We felt like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops though.  It reminded me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers.  At least the garlic bread was good, but they charge you for any additional baskets beyond the first.",

What a delightful place. The ambiance was much more than expected for a strip mall, and the wait staff was pleasant and the food was SO good. The garlic bread was addicting and we had two family-style salads which were delish. I had spaghetti with eggplant, ground beef and red sauce for my entree and it was very good. The only very small hitch was that we traveled with a vegan who wasn't able to eat the pasta because it's made fresh with eggs. For us non-vegans, that was a big plus! For the vegan, he ended up with a small pizza with some red sauce and veggies (no cheese) and a salad. Still pretty good!

I could not believe how utterly busy this place was on a Tuesday night.  We arrived at 8PM and still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  Upon sitting down at our table we were immediately served with fresh, hot and oh so yummy, garlic bread.  Our waiters were super friendly.  For appetizers, we started off with the mozzarella sticks and calamari.  Both were very delicious!  We split the small order of the antipasto salad which had: Romaine lettuce, mozzarella, pepperoncini, olives, onions, tomatoes, and rolled ham,   provolone,and salame, served with our homemade Italian dressing.  It was soooooo good!!!  I ordered the Fettuccine Carbonara, my fiance ordered the linguine and clams and my friend ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Every dish was outstanding!  The portions are huge,  you will definitely have left overs.  Service was also very fast and efficient.  We will definitely go back!",

As soon as I walked in, the feeling of a fine, classy, sophisticated, elegant italian place is the vibe you get. Not to mention, for its \"space\", it's adorable. Nice bar, live italian music playing and a good amount of well-dressed people have let me know this is a decent place. We didn't have to wait very long which was nice. While we did wait, we were able to watch the cooks preparing authentic italian food. When we sat down everything was formal, almost as if we were on a  spot on the strip. Though the room started to remind me a little bit of an office building, the decor made up for it as the ceilings were decorated and the walls were dressed as if it may be your own grandmothers dining room. Cute.  I enjoy when the servers are wearing vests because I know I will get the quality I want. But downfall was the server took a long time at first. The complimentary italian garlic bread is a bit buttery for my own diet but the fact it wasn't just a basket of butter packets and bread made this place a little different then the others & also, the fact that it had fresh, chopped garlic on it  as well made up for the too much butter .When we got our dishes the food was perfect and just enough. One of the dishes we ordered was the 'Alla Nora' and I'd recommend it if you like a robust meat sauce (bolognese)  with breaded eggplant - fried. Comes with spaghetti obviously. Not bad if this is one of their signature dishes -assuming. For the lack of perfect service the girl made up for it by bringing us a complimentary dessert. Or was it because we told her it was our first time there? :) Either way, Tiramasu is definitely not my type of dessert but its the thought that counts. I'd recommend this restaurant for a special birthday or a romantic, quiet dinner. I would definitely come back to try out something different on the menu since I was satisfied with the other menu items. I'd recommend this place also with another couple or a date because it's definitely one of the more intimate places to go, even if it's just to have a glass of wine and listen to the live italian music.",

Our table of 6 was ready 15 minutes early, ambience is very nice with a jazz band performing live after 9 p.m.  Service was very good except for the fact that each couple was served at separately rather than get help to bring out everyone's course at the same time.  As to the food, the steak bruschetta is very good as an appetizer but the caesar salad was terrible.  Hardly any dressing and very little parmesan cheese with no fresh pepper as a topper.  My wife ordered a chicken alfredo with boiled chicken and small portions compared to the mound of noodles with little sauce.  Her chicken was not seasoned at all.  I ordered the veal marsala which had great portions but was way overseasoned to the point I was chugging water and the spaghetti was not that good.  Dessert was tiramisu which is good but a little sweet.  Pricing is certainly the best part, our dinner was $83 for the 2 of us which included wine and dessert.  Liked the free glass of wine at check-in but we left underwhelmed considering the number of restaurants here in Vegas.",

Free glass of Chianti with yelp check-in so we all cashed in on it.   I ended up ordering the Crazy Alfredo because in my boozed up state i completely forgot about the Osso Buco they also serve.  Regardless the Crazy Alfredo is pretty damn amazing and damn crazy. It's got A LOT of things going on for one dish and A LOT of pasta for a decent price.",

The servings are enough for whole meal to have later. Calamari was perfect. Bruschetta was ehh. Not a fan of super thick large bread pieces. The tomatoes were wonderful. Cannolis were insanely yummy. Chocolate cake was too rich for my taste. They get slammed, so set reservations!",

Checked in on the Yelp app and received a glass of wine! Free wine = AMAZEBALLS!  Started off with the house garlic bread. It was very good. You could tell this was homemade, not some frozen loaf coming from a distributor. Just that principle of not having frozen cheap appetizer had me already falling in love.   Then we moved to the bruschetta. It came served on a large slide of soft bread. This was some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. It was not your average sampling, this is what I've been missing my entire life.   My entree was the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken. Similar to the bruschetta, this was done right! The pasta was perfectly textured and consistent throughout. The sauce on this was heavier than my liking, but it fit very well with the dish. The biggest surprise here was the blue cheese on top. I've never heard of pasta being topped with blue cheese, but I fell in love with it!   By this point we were stuffed and ready to fall asleep in our carb coma.",

    "text": "This spot came highly recommended by my coworkers. I could tell that most of the diners here are regulars. It took me awhile to get here since it's a bit of a drive from home for me.  We arrived at the start of dinner service and found that they were already getting busy. The hostess was quick in getting everyone seated. Our waiter was quick to greet us and get drinks started. He was friendly and professional. There was never a long period of time without him checking in on us.   The garlic bread was really good. It's definitely meant for True garlic lovers, but this is why I liked it. We passed on a second basket because we didn't want to get too full, but I regretted it later.   I started with a House Salad and my husband started with the Caesar Salad. Both salads were very good. I really liked the house Italian dressing and the large portion of cheese on top.   For my main entree I had the Crazy Alfredo because this was the dish recommended to me by all Nora's fans. The dish lived up to the hype for me even though I think this was my first alfredo dish in at least 10 years. The sauce was delicious and I loved the combination of chicken, sausage, shrimp, jalapeno, cheese, and mushrooms. Definitely a yummy combination. The portion was enough for two people and could definitely be shared. I'd also recommend sharing since it is such a rich dish.  My husband ordered the Veal Parmesan. He thought it was good, but not the best he has ever had. I tasted the red sauce on the spaghetti and didn't care for it.   The food overall was pretty good and I'm excited to give them a try when they build their new restaurant. We'll be back to give them another try.",

The service this time was good. Nothing out of the ordinary but nothing bad either.   They start the meal off with garlic bread. It's so good it can be hard to stop eating it.   This time I started off the meal with a resiling. It was good but very sweet. I was kind of surprised because it was sweeter than I though it would be.  I then decided on angel hair pasta with vodka sauce. I like getting thin pasta because it makes it less filling and rich. I really enjoyed it. The portion was good so I was able to take it home for dinner the next day which I always consider a plus.  For dessert we decided to get the tiramisu. I had never had it here before and was so happy we finally decided to try it! It was amazing and I will need to continue ordering this in the future.   In the past we have also tried the peanut butter martini. If you like to drink your dessert then omg you have to try this! So yummy and satisfying.   This is a must try in Las Vegas!",

My friend you are supposed to be friendly and kind with the guests but instead you walking around like a big AHOLE!!!!! I was about to make you a nasty review but the crew in the floor and kitchen don't deserve that because of you!! Mr manager.",

The parking lot is too small for the size of the restaurant, but there's plenty of street parking.    They offer garlic bread which was really good.  I had calamari and it was the usual at any Italian restaurant.  I tried the melrose shrimp with half chicken and half shrimp.  My dish was really good and really creamy.  Every thing that went into my mouth was fat girl heaven.    Downfall, with a really cool place like this they didn't offer freshly grated Parmesan.  I don't understand this.    The service was good and I really want to come back if I'm in the area.",

I ordered the eggplant and it was delicious. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. I tried and it is the best I ever had, I will def be ordering that next time . My wife ordered the baked rigatoni , excellent . We were served tiramisu for her bday! Class act all the way around.. we will def be back. The garlic bread for the table was awesome!

Nice atmosphere, live band, it was very comforting and welcoming. The server, Kara came to greet us at a reasonable time. I ordered my drink and couple mins later we ordered our appetizers. Our appetizers came out really quick and the server came to take our entree orders. She helped me pick out my entree and everything was going really well until afterwards..... our food didn't come out for 40 mins. (Literally.) Not sure if she forgot about us but I know for a fact that the table next to us sat down quite after us and they got their meal way before we did. I understand if there was some sort of a mistake, kitchen being backed up, etc but she avoided our table until our food came out. She would walk past our table to check up on the table next to us but not a single word to us. I wish she could've came up to reassure that our food is still being worked on or SOMETHING. After long wait, the food was good.. but not outstanding. It definitely was not worth the wait and the poor service. We expected so much better for a nice fine dining restaurant like this.",

We had a great waiter Sebastian that was very knowledgeable and courteous to our needs. I'm not sure I can say I was in love with the food though, but I will say maybe I need to try again. My husband wanted risotto but they only have risotto balls. He ordered a margarita pizza large which was $18. Where he may have gone wrong is he ordered extra sauce and we both agreed it was too much. His bad, I think normal sauce would have been how he liked it. I ordered the baked rigatoni do it arrived way too baked. The inside was very dry and it was a ricotta overload. The dish was not deep at all so the ricotta being dry from heat soaked up any sauce. The meat sauce wasn't very meaty. In fact I didn't taste too much meat. So may be I ordered wrong and again the place is affordable and nice enough for second chances!",

Everyone we talked to about \"the best Italian said \"Nora\"......Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by the front desk staff, we were sat right on time for our reservation. That's just about where the good ends. As soon as our servers gets to our table of 2, we are not greeted....simply asked if we wanted a soup or salad. At this time we ordered a bottle of wine with our appetizer, shortly after ordered our entree. Finally we ask our server if our bottle of wine will be out soon. She told us it should be almost ready (mind we have been waiting 30 minutes for 1 bottle for 2 people). Five minutes later the server comes back ask \"What did you even order from the bar?\" Our food came at that time, so we then said we no longer wanted the bottle. I'm not sure how you forget your tables wine? A $150 bottle especially. The garlic bread was burnt and the pasta was really not even worth calories. We then ordered desert, the Panna Cotta and a Peanut Butter Cup cocktail (best thing at the restaurant). Our server did try to make up for her mistake by bringing us 3 deserts comped....Yet she never brought the Panna Cotta that I ordered. A restaurant can have mediocre food and have good service and still be worth the visit. A restaurant can have mediocre service and excellent food and still be worth the visit. However, bad food and poor service are a combination that doesn't mix. Our visit to Nora was nothing short of counting the minutes until the meal was over.",

    "text": "Nora's used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town and definitely my go-to for Italian. But since the change of location... it hasn't been the same.  First, the parking situation was horrible. On a Wednesday night, there's no parking... people were parking in the dirt or the plaza across the street. There is always a wait.  Most recently when I went, I made a reservation a week ahead of time for a party of 12. We arrive on the dot and ended up waiting 20 minutes for the table, only to find the table to be very cramped for the large party. The service was horribly slow. We had to ask multiple times for the [delicious] bread. We waited probably around 1 hour for our main courses... which came out dry. We ordered a good variety from pasta to fish to fillet mignon to osso buco. Nothing was prepared right. The meat was over cooked, the pasta was oily and you can tell it was sitting under the heater too long cause the sauce was dried onto the plate around the edges, and the flavors were just not there.  I understand this place is busy, but the server just never seems to be around. They never seem to have the beer selection from their menu.   Only redeeming thing is the busser was always around to ensure we had water and drink refills.  Anyone got good recommendations for a new Italian restaurant? I'm open to suggestions at this point.",

    "text": "Classy italian restaurant that'll knock your socks off.      Went on Sunday 12-20-15 at 6:30 with my yelpy friend Jamie P.  She was nice enough to make us reservations and the place was packed so I'm glad she did that! We had 4 adults and a baby in our party and the hostess threw a hissy fit because she said the reservation is for four....not five people...so we'll have to wait.  I was thinking can't we just pull up a high chair to the table?  The answer was no.  Ended up being seated about 7PM and no food on the table until about 7:40 but that's the *only* puny little complaint that I have.    $95.83 got us a small 4 Staggioni pizza, a margarita, a whiskey sidecar cocktail, an appetizer of clams, a house salad, a chocolate cake, two coffees, and a ginger ale.  The table and napkins are real white linen and the table is covered by white paper.  Crayola crayons were brought out for my boy which I thought was cool (none of that cheap-o Rose Art shit).    I originally wanted the Branzino but they were out :( *sad violin noises*   The clams were hot and fresh and the menu says it comes with 12 but I swear there were at least 2 dozen in my bowl.  The menu says  \"12 Manila Clams, Evo, Lemon Parsly\" and I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell parsley and shouldn't it be \"EVOO\" if they are trying to say extra virgin olive oil?  Whatevs....it was $14.95 and the clams were hot and sweet and wonderful.  I only had one that was sandy but the rest were awesome.    The 4 Staggioni pizza had pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, and olives.  The small was $15.45 and worth every penny.  I loved the puffy crust and I'm enjoying the leftovers today as we speak.    The chocolate cake must be ordered ahead of time (at the time you order your entrees) and was a steal for $6.50.  It is a rich, soft centered, Valrohna chocolate cake adorned by a vanilla sauce and pistachios.  Valrohna is a type of rich chocolate heavy on the cocoa side.  I absolutely loved this.  It's making my mouth water right now just thinking about it!   With Olive Garden being the only other italian food I've experienced, this place blows it out of the water.  It would be a great place to take a date or family members that come here from out of town.  I liked it a lot!  And I liked the good company even more. *wink wink*",

I am a hotel concierge so when guests ask me \"what's the best local restaurant off the strip?\" I always have recommended Nora's.  7/6/18, I took my very lovely clients from overseas right after they landed because it was the wife's request.  I took them to Nora's twice before. The hostess was very nice and we got in on time at our reservation time. But a mins after we met the horrible server lady we knew she is not good  at all. She NEVER EVER smiled.  She was very short and didn't even suggest anything and so unfriendly. We all felt the same vibe from her that she doesn't want to take care of us and want us to leave as soon as possible. When we ask to take pics, she showed us the face that \" why the hell are you asking me, I have better things to do.\" We all felt really unwelcomed. I have never had this bad service not even fast food places. Our white pizza was amazing as usual. The fried rice balls were amazing as well. But my favourite mussels was already not hot at all so it was not good at all. I didn't want bother her because every time she was at our table, she was not pleasant. Nobody refilled my water AT ALL all night. She didn't even offered us desert or coffee.  We wanted coffee but we really couldn't take it anymore. We really didn't want to see her unwelcomed face any longer.  This ruined my client's first night back in Vegas. I talked with a manager( Asian guy) and he said \" Well, maybe she was just overwhelming. \" Huh???? His eyes were looking at somewhere else entire time while I was talking to him. He made me even more upset after sharing about my experience, because I could tell he didn't care at all either. Heeven said hello to other customers while i was talking to him.  Definitely the worst experience at the Nora's since 1999. And I don't think i will not recommend this place nor going there for while. Just really horrible experience.",

Our party was however the youngest and least dressed up because it was a last minute decision as our first choice place was closed for the day. We really didn't know what to expect as it was our first time. If they didn't have a dress code, they should, because everyone else was dressed really nice and seemed like they were there for some kind of special occasion!   We came here around 6:30pm and beat the dinner rush! Didn't take us long to be seated. I really didn't know what to expect, because outside it didn't look like much, but on the inside, it was like WOW. It was really nice, there are three parts to the restaurant, the middle is where you enter, you can see some people working on the pizza boxes and such and a hostess, the right is the bar area with a lot of seating and the restrooms are located there. The left was the main dinning area where we were seated.   The restaurant is family owned which opened in 1991 (the menu had a bit of history on it when you first open it). With the yelp check-in you get a complimentary glass of wine, with any order. Which it came in a decanter (see picture) and they pour some of it into your glass after they place it on the table.   It took us quite a while to order, well myself really, the guys already knew what they wanted. When we finally ordered, it took a while for the food to come out, but when it came out it was HOT, fresh hot out of the oven / stove. Out of our group we had the Rigatoni special, Crazy Alfredo, and al la Nora. Oh we also got a small basket of garlic bread, which the first one is free, and if you wanted more it was about $2.50 (I'll confirm again next time I go).   The Rigatoni special contained sausage, meatballs, onions, pepper, in a tomato sauce, it was very good. Everything was cooked very well and contained a lot of flavor in the meats. I really enjoyed it and it filled me up fast. Though I felt there was more meat than there was pasta, for some this is a good thing, but for myself it isn't. I would still recommend it!   The crazy alfredo contained both meat and seafood, which looked good, but I didn't get to try it. And the al la Nora was a baked dish containing spaghetti, eggplant, beef, tomato sauce, and some others ingredients (I don't remember all of them) which my other friend enjoyed.   I can't wait to go back and try one of their pizzas!!",

This has become a staple for my company when we are here on business.   From the exterior a Non-Local would not think much of the restaurant because it is located in strip mall.  HOWEVER, trust me when I say this is probably some of the best Italian food in the Las Vegas Area.    The Chicken Mt. Etna was unlike anything I have ever had (and I live just outside of NYC).",

The bartenders didn't seem to be fans of straws but my wife pilfered one before leaving the bar for our table. Our server Will encouraged her to recycle her last straw which really showed a lot of responsibility for the earth. I could see voting for this man in the next four years, though he politely withheld his political views. He recommended the cannoli and I must say the cannoli came and kept coming. The Pinot noir was delightful with blackberry notes and a hint of old Italian leather belts, like grandpa used to wear.",

Service was good food was great and price was decent what more can u ask for Nora's is my go to Italian restaurant from now on and that's high praise from a NY Italian.

    "text": "We have been coming to Nora's for years, but for the last two the service and feeling when dining has gone down hill.  We made reservations three weeks ahead and still were told it would be a few minutes.  30 minutes later standing in a sea of backed up guests we were now told the people at our table decided to have dessert.  What does this even mean?  We were then offered the bar or the patio.  Being our anniversary this is not acceptable.  Nora's used to be a fun place, but it seems they have gotten too big for themselves, they have stopped caring about the customers.  I guess they have enough so why be bothered.  They need some kind of actual system for reservations that works.  On New Year's this also happened but it was worse because 5 tables that had reservations after us were sat first, looked like they forgot us at the bar.  The food is definitely not worth the aggravation and other reviewers are right if something is writing they just shrug and don't care.  Bye Nora's, there are too many restaurants in Vegas to worry about this mediocre mess of a business.",

The rest of the restaurant was lively and busy and had live music, nice decor and was decorated for Christmas. But for some reason, this room seemed like a late addition that might be used for private parties but had no ambiance. Totally underwhelming and odd that the restaurant wouldn't follow through with the same design in this other room.   The service was whatever and the food was mediocre. The appetizers were good but the gnocchi with vodka sauce was 17.50 and wasn't anything special. My husband enjoyed his pasta, but not enough to return.   I've wanted to come to this location for a while but hadn't had the chance. And now that we tried it, I think there's way better places. And I'm sure sitting in that lame little room was a factor.",

It was a short drive from the Las Vegas Strip. Our GPS alerted us that we had arrived. There was plenty of parking for a 7:00 PM reservation on a Sunday evening.   We walked in and it was bustling with people. Our friends had already arrived and the host seated us immediately. The table was in a separate room where we could see the Main dinning room through the big glass windows. You could probably have a nice private event or special occasion in that room. It's a beautiful space.  The beverage menu had specialty cocktails with detailed descriptions. The mixologist really put a lot of thought into those selections but I went with the well vodka which I was told was Titos. Hey I was very happy with that. Everyone else chose there beverage of choice.   We started off with the tender grilled octopus appetizer and a lovely hand tossed Cesar salad. That and 2 cocktails were filling me up so I ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer as my entree. The other entree selections on our table were ossobuca, frutti di mare, and chicken marsala. Everything was very tasty, not over cooked and well presented. We finished the evening by the four of us sharing a light tiramisu for dessert.   The staff was very attentive, professional and efficient. The decor was dark wood with beautiful big windows and etched glass. Very beautiful!",

    "text": "I'm giving 4 stars mainly because we've been to Nora's before and had fabulous dinners. My bday dinner last night, was worth 3 stars, unfortunately.  We ordered some calamari and bruschetta for appetizers. Gold stars there! Then main course comes.  I had frutti di mare which was outstanding!!! My son ordered a small pizza (it's the size of a medium at other pizza places). The husband and other son both ordered chicken marsala, which comes with a side of spaghetti and tomato sauce. There were 4 small pieces of chicken on a huge plate, which was NOT cleaned, meaning splashes of the sauce were all over the plate. The tomato sauce tasted like it was out of a can and not Nora's delicious sauce that we liked in the past. The marsala sauce, we felt, was not cooked out enough. I don't know, it could just be an \"off night\" for the marsala entrees. My son and husband ate the chicken and some of the noodles but it just wasn't the same dinners we had before.  The reason we came was for my birthday and when we made reservations, this was specified. The girl taking the reservation said they will do something special. I said, 'Wonderful!\". Long story short, I didn't get anything extra. No scoop of ice cream or anyone singing me happy birthday. Maybe things have changed since the last time we came but it's little things like that which make people want to come celebrate special occasions there.  **Yes you'll see I've only checked in here once because this is the first time I'm here since joining Yelp. We've come to Nora's numerous times when they were at their old location, off of Jones..",

Service has always been on point each time I've been there.    I'm a creature of habit.   I basically get the same thing every time.  They start you off with garlic bread which hits the spot soooo hard.   Love it, plus it's complimentary.  And I know it's just garlic bread, but damn it's tasty.     Next I split the truffle fries ($5.50) which whomever I happen to be eating with.   The sauce the give you is delicious and I always have to ask for a bonus sauce.    For the main course it's either the cannelloni with ricotta and spinach or baked ziti (they use a different kind of noodle but basically same stuff).  Both are really good.   This place Is very borderline 5 stars.  Love me some noras.   Prices are reasonable and portions are solid.",

There's always a wait so either snag a set at the bar or make reservations.   I've come here multiple times and get pasta every time. Their penne with vodka sauce is delicious and creamy. The pesto is very rich but a whole bowl of it can be too much. Their wild boar perpedelle is also wonderful but sometimes can be on the saltier side.   My favorites are the pasta all Nora ( basically spaghetti bolognese with eggplant) and their rigatoni special but I sub the tomato sauce with vodka sauce for a creamier richer taste.     They also offer complimentary garlic bread to go with your meal and the garlic bread is delicious. Sometimes I'm guilty of filling up on that too quickly but thats ok because I'll have leftover pasta for the next day!",

I was not impressed with the rib eye on my previous visit but wanted to try it again to give them the benefit of doubt.  This last visit I ordered the rib eye medium-rare.  When I cut into the rib eye there no pink it was more medium-well to well.  For $35 I expect it prepared the way I request it.",

Especially the past few times I went.  The vegetables and salad dressing were extremely oily.  The sauce to the chicken marsala is good but doesn't taste as good as it used to. The pizza was downright awful the last time we tried it.  On a positive note the garlic bread is still amazing.  Every couple of months I venture back hoping it goes back to how it used to be but I am about ready to throw in the towel.  It's just not worth the price for what has become very average dining.",

The cheese was great and the texture exacting. My wife had the Melrose, it was also excellent. The atmosphere was great. The music was a little loud but not too bad. The best part which is hard to say was the service from Jessika. She was super friendly, conversational, informative, educated on the wine/dinner menu and made great recommendations. No need to eat on the strip if you want fantastic Italian food. Come to Nora's I will be back for sure the next time I am in Vegas. I would say if we were in Chicago I would have a tough time  choosing between Rosebuds and here.",

We asked to speak to the manager just because of the principle of the fact ,she came to the table she looked like she had slept in her clothes and said to us what do you need we explain the situation and she said I don't make the price its Miss Nora and I said do you not think that's a little excessive to asked for some spaghetti to be with the chicken piccata and she said I don't make the prices it's Miss Nora but if you want I can take it off I said that's not the point the point is my husband paid $16 for his meal linguine with clams  And I was being charged $9.50 for a small side of spaghetti with olive oil. We have been eating at Noras for at least 10 years and I am here for the magic show and my husband joined me for the weekend this is not the same restaurant I'm not sure if the owners sold it to this new company but it used to be very family oriented and the people that worked at the restaurant were fabulous now the restaurant is being run by a group of 20 year olds including the managers go  does not have a clue. What happened in Nora?  We will not be returning",

On our first trip here, near the end of the meal we were approached by a lifelong New Yorker who had moved to Las Vegas later in life and had NOT found an Italian restaurant worthy of frequenting UNTIL this day.

    "text": "Highly suggested italian place to go to when asked among people on yelp and friends. So decided to try this one day when trying to decide what was for dinner.   Located on the north side of flamingo, a little east of jones, came here on a Friday Night around 630 PM. The place was pretty full but luckily i guess we got there before the dinner rush so we got our table pretty quick.   A LITTLE NOTE : uhh i think this place may have or rather should have some sort of dress code... i think we were the most underdressed table in the entire restaurant.. me and my friend were ok but my other friend had a bright blue t shirt.. lol uhh id suggest to dress a little nicer for this place...   The restaurant is family owned. opened since 1991 starting with 12 seats ! quite expanded since then.. restaurant decorated with family pictures i believe which is nice.   We were greeted by the server and got our drinks pretty quick. We had noticed that with a check in on yelp, you get a complimentary glass of wine :D   After we ordered, it took a little while before the food came and we were starving.. they gave us some Garlic Bread which the first batch was free, but if u wanted more, i dont remember it being that expensive. It was yummy ! pretty much pieces you'd see if you split a loaf of french bread in half, baked it, and cut it into 1-2\" pieces down the split loaf. it was slightly baked.. I LOVE GARLIC BREAD ! their's still had a soft center with the exterior crust still being crunchy but not hard no wont pierce the inside of your mouth.   When the food came... its was piping HOT !! i had the alla nora myself. which was a baked spaghetti with eggplants, ground beef, pesto, tomato sauce and cheeses. When i \"broke through\" the top, oh man there was a lot of steam ! not complaining ! very good thing that i rarely experience ! all the ingredients were fresh and seasoned well. egg plants were slightly fried but not over fried so still quite juicy and moist but soft. tomato sauce was fresh and delicious. sweet, tangy but savory?   My friends had the rigatoni special and the crazy alfredo. i didnt really get to try either of them but im pretty sure you'd find a nice review on here somewhere. I tasted the veggies of the rigatoni special. Very fresh and sweet. Not overcooked so they still had a nice bite to it. The crazy alfredo looked delicious. Packed with various ingredients all with a creamy alfredo sauce ! i wanna get that next time !   But all in all.. great place.. highly suggested. reservations are available if needed. would suggest to all who ask and take more here :D",

    "text": "Last day in Vegas so figured that Vegas has a lot of good Italian since there not much back home. Through yelp, found this place. Gave it a try. It was lunch hour when we arrived so the restaurant was busy. We had spaghetti meatballs, rigatoni and I ordered crazy alfredo. While waiting for our order we were served with garlic breads. It was unusual as it was the first. Normally restaurants would give you a plain bread with butter or some kind of dipping while waiting.  Loved loved the garlic breads. It was cut into a bite sized and it was yummy and crispy. Not long afterwards came our menu. Mine sure look a lot lol...it's crazy alfredo with chicken, bell peppers, shrimp minus the sausage. It was rich and creamy...gosh....I'm in pasta heaven...it sure a class of its own. Kudos for the chef who cooked my yummy pasta. Halfway I was full but I know I gotta finish and savor it as I won't be able to taste it again in the near future. So I made it and licked the plate clean. Before we left we ordered cannoli. It's been a while since we had it in New York and yeah a big giant cannoli answered our prayer. It was filled with chocolate chips on one side and pistachios on the other. It was enough to fill all of us. Yeah...we left with a full belly and happy smiles Thank you Vegas for the great food we had it beat all that expensive buffets that being served everywhere in those casinos esp bellagio. They got a very bland Asian dishes. Only good for steak and desserts...urrgghhh...",

Glad they opened the new larger location, but reservations are still highly recommended no matter what day of the week it is. I love the caprese and antipasto salads. For pasta, the Alla Nora is probably one of my favorites. And their specialty cocktails are amazing! They also have gluten free penne pasta. Nora's is my happy place!",

Imagine my surprise when after paying $20 for a burger and fries on the Strip (shame on you, Smash Burger), I treated myself to a first real veal parm dinner for $18.95 at Nora's. And it was pretty damn good, too.  The veal was cooked perfectly, and it came with a side of spaghetti, cooked al dente.  Perfect.  The sauce was not the best I ever had, but then again, I was not cooking it in the kitchen myself.  Making matters better, the basket of garlic bread was never allowed to run dry, nor was my iced tea.  The service was fantastic and pleasant.  Smiles all around.    The short lesson here is that if you are willing to move a few miles off the strip, you end up in a different, and much better food universe.  I would go back to Nora's in a nanosecond.",

    "text": "Since I last reviewed Nora's two months ago, I have been here twice more, and each time it just gets better and better.  Wonderful food smells of pizza and other Italian delicacies strike one's nostrils as soon as the front door is opened; the friendly service has remained generally excellent regardless who I was served by; and the food has continued to be piping hot and always delicious.  I now realize that the Veal Parmigiana is as good and tender as the Veal Marsala; the Garlic Bread is consistently delectable (my group of 4 polished off 2 baskets); and the Chicken Soup is on the same high plane as the homemade Pasta Fagioli.  On my latest foray I enjoyed Antipasto Salad, and could barely finish half of it.  I look forward to eating the remainder later at lunch today.  Topped by chunks of fresh Mozzarella Cheese, folded over curls of tasty ham mixed with leafy greens, ripe wedges of red tomato, black olives, pepperoncini, and more, all coated with a dripping light Italian Dressing, beckon.  The Chicken Soup, which I was smart enough to order as a bowl rather than a cup, contained thin lengths of chicken just as I preferred, mixed with cooked celery and pieces of tomato, swimming in a hot, very tasty chicken broth.  It took many tablespoonfuls for me to finish it all, and almost ruined my appetite.  But not quite!  With considerable effort I also finished off a large cheesy and tomato sauce-covered medallion of Veal Parmigiana accompanied by smoking Spaghetti Bolognese with mushrooms added, as I had decreed.  Diane got a requested bowl of extra Alfredo Sauce to ladle over her Veal and Penne Alfredo at no extra charge.  Here one can have whatever the tummy desires!  For good reason, Nora's will remain one of my several fine, go-to Italian restaurants in Vegas!",

My pour of wine was generous and Hub's mojito was delicious.   We started with bruschetta pomodoro and arancini. Both were delicious! The arancini were crisp, but not greasy and came out to the table piping hot. For our mains, Hubs had gnocchi ala vodka which he enjoyed. I had pasta carbonara, which was prepared a bit differently than classic carbonara, but was delicious!! The pasta was nice and al dente, which is always appreciated.   One of the things that impressed me on top of the delicious food was how well run this place was. They have quite a large staff. Hosts/hostesses/servers/bussers/food runners. Everyone was on top of their respected positions and everyone worked effortlessly together. A very well oiled machine, management should be very proud of how flawlessly the staff here executes. I will definitely recommend Nora's to anyone finding the self in Vegas.",

When I visited recently with two friends I had been raving to about Nora's for months, we were all super-disappointed. Sad to say, the service has gone supremely downhill over the last few years. We arrived and waited at the bar for our reservation. Then they sat us at a table in the bar, DIRECTLY next to the stage. It took practically years for us to get any water, then the musicians started filtering in. A tip jar was set up literally in FRONT of our table. My friend complained to the server about moving tables and was given a flat-out refusal. I then went to the hostess and complained, and we were moved to a spot next to the kitchen. The food took about an hour and a half to get to us and we were practically begging for water from anyone who walked by. Food was ok, I've definitely had better, and I don't think I will be back :'(",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place because it's Liana's favorite Italian place when she lived in Las Vegas, so Dennis, Liana and I made a trip to Nora's before our flight out of Vegas. I usually review a place mostly for its food quality, but Nora lost a star due to its extraordinarily bad service.   Let's start with the food first: 1) Pomodoro Bruchetta (3 stars) - but unless you're hankering for it, I say skip it... for tomatoes on toast, it's not worthy $7. 2) Truffle fries (4 stars) - very truffly, crunchy and delicious, but over the top salty. 3) Garlic bread (3 stars) - not bad, not great... it was made better by olive oil 4) Alla Nora (3 stars) - the eggplant was really dry, crunchy, bordering on hard to chew. The meat sauce had good flavors, but the spaghetti is also crunchy and dried out on the edges.   5) Primavera (4 stars) - it's like a garden exploded on a plate. It's good, but after half of the plate the oils felt over powering. 6) Pappardelle with Wild Boar - not sure, since I didn't get to taste this dish, nor did we have a discussion about it... Dennis finished it, so it can't be bad.   The pages of the menu were a bit sticky, that should have been our first warning, but one never really think of such things when your tired butt hits the seat. The bar service was actually reasonably good, other than the placemats being wet. We wanted to sit at a table, so as soon as one became available, we switched over. The first napkin was a bit dingy in one corner, but once reseated, there was a second set of napkin/silverwear combo, so I didn't say anything. My bread plate was coated with a thin layer of grease and a chunk of dried food on one side - had to ask for another one. Within 5 minutes of sitting down, we realize we were against the stage where the band (arriving in at this moment) will be playing. After being brushed behind the head with the cello, I got up to the hostess and asked to be reseated. She looked me straight in the eye and said \"no - the table that's available is already taken.\" BY WHO? No one was there.   No apology.   I return to the table and me and my table mates sat stunned for about 5 minutes. At which point a man walks over and pulls a chair from our table and set up a tip jar right at our table. Liana about flipped out, and got up once again to request a table switch... this time asking a different hostess, and probably raising her tone slightly.   We were reseated in the kitchen area with annoyance from the staff.   Again, no apology.   We had no water refills for 15 to 20 minutes and while the bus girl was responsive when we were able to flag her down, we were already rather displeased. The food was abysmally slow.   Seriously, I am so irritated typing this review that I want to give them just one star, but I'm being judicious.   I would not come back and I would recommend you don't go at all.",

    "text": "My friend recommended Nora's for dinner this past Sunday night and I was impressed.  Highlights: - Large portion sizes. I got the rigatoni special with sausage, peppers, onions in a spicy tomato sauce. It was delicious and probably enough for a lunch portion the next day. - Complimentary Garlic Bread. Not only is it complimentary, this garlic bread is delicious. Could not stop eating this. - Prices were very reasonable in the $15-20 range. Definitely a Vegas Italian restaurant locals can go to on a weekly basis. - Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and had a great bite to it.  - Calamari was really good. Portion size was larger than I expected for a seafood appetizer. - Plenty of parking out front. However, this place gets packed quickly. - Make a Reservation. Expect to wait 15 minutes after your reservation on busy nights.  - Good Music. They had a few string musicians on Sunday night and it was a great complement to the food. Appreciated that.   Overall, would definitely head back to this next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

Ambience-- Upon entering, I felt as if I left Las Vegas and was teleported to 1950s Manhattan. Very classy and cozy.  Service-- Service was on point. Our waiter was attentive but not overly so. Water and wine glasses were never left empty until we were done.  Food-- Normally, I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, but damn does Nora's make me want to change my mind. The shrimp scampi I had was flavorful and generously portioned. The shrimp itself were cooked just right and also very large and plump! My friend's veal marsala had great flavor to it as well. The highlight was probably the juicy, crispy amazing garlic bread. Wish I could have some right now!  Nora's is a great local spot that is suitable for families, friends, and especially dates. Too bad it closes so early!",

The Arranchinis were pretty good but I couldn't recommend Nora's based on our experience     They are in the process of building a large new restaurant about 2 blocks away so we obviously have missed something ~ the 2 stars were for the cocktail which were quite good and our server was knowledgeable & pleasant.",

    "text": "Good, NOT Great. NONE of the pastas are fresh. Too bad. This would set Noras apart from average. If you REALLY want to be recognized as one of the best Italian restaurants, MAKE FRESH PASTA. The \"boxed\", processed pasta noodles renders the prices a bit high for average pasta dishes. Furthermore, my dish was completely over-sauced. The creamy pesto sauce, while tasty, had my pasta drowning in sauce, rendering the dish not as great as it should be. My dinner partner had Carbonara. Be warned this is NOT a traditional Carbonara (alfredo sauce - really!?), so the dish was a let down.  And yes, the pasta was a bit \"gummy\" (no, not al dente either), on both dishes. The fried calamari app was excellent. The gratis garlic bread wonderful. Service was good, not great, as the restaurant was very busy during holiday season.  You know you are going to be packed, so why didnt management staff properly!? We waited forever for our dishes.  Lastly, the \"pre-order\" chocolate cake dessert was nothing special and our table wondered why the hoopla over pre-ordering it? Its not that worthy. All in all, Noras is just OK for a local, neighborhood place. Because of a recent rebuild, of course it is a wondrrful atmosphere. Yet, the final disappointment, was in the fact, when we inquired, that we were also hoping for a nice happy hour offering, with cocktail and appetizer, and pizza specials at the bar area. Noras offers none. What a missed opportunity, Noras! Would we go again? Being unmemorable, not so sure. You may have been great before your move / expansion, but your newness may have blinded your ability to be what you once were. There are many, many better, neighborhood, off-strip, family-owned, Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. This is just a \"maybe\" place. You CAN (and should) do better, Noras.",

This was my first experience at Nora's, and WOW just isn't a big enough word to describe it.   Employees? Fun, playful, attentive, offer their recommendations on menu items. Atmosphere? Clean, dimly lit for great ambiance, colorful, busy (it was packeddd on a Thursday night, yet the room didn't feel crowded or chaotic.) Food? Not just the best Italian food I've ever eaten, but some of the best FOOD I've ever eaten in general! Wine selection was great. Appetizers were hardy. All menu items were not outrageously priced (as you would expect them to be for a meal of this quantity AND quality.)   Yes. Just, yes. Go now. I highly recommended it.  If there is a line, wait. I promise it'll be worth it.",

When she got home all she saw in her to go box with 4 little pieces of octopus with an old looking wilted salad. She paid $20.00 for that to go dish. I called the restaurant to speak to the manger he was unavailable so I left a message. He hasn't returned my call. We were very disappointed.",

First off the parking is terrible, had to circle the lot a few times to find a space.  The garlic bread was amazing (only reason for even one star).  Next we got the rice balls, they were served cold and the rice wasn't cooked.  I ordered the Chicken Parm, I noticed it had a funny taste.  There was no way I could eat it so I sent it back, I asked the waitress if they put fennel in it and she said no, they put mint in the breadcrumbs.  I have never in my life had Chicken Parm with mint.  The ordered the Chicken Marsala, and again, not your normal Marsala, it was very sweet and the sauce thick, tasted more like molasses than Marsala.  Needless to say, we won't be back.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm headed out to lunch with coworkers/vendors, and people are in the mood for Italian, two places come up as suggestions: Pasta Mia and Nora's.  I've been to Pasta Mia quite a few times and well...whenever these decisions come up I'm always rooting for Nora's.  Now maybe it's because I grew up going to places like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill, but for the most part I've never \"craved\" Italian food for the better part of my life.  Nothing against those two restaurant chains, I've had good family celebrations there, but the food never hooked me.  Well, my opinion of Italian is slowly changing after visiting Nora's repeatedly.  I started out with fettuccine, spaghetti, etc. and all those other dishes that most places serve.  What really won me over was their Melrose Pesto.  I've had pesto before at other places, and there were times were I was gagging it down.  I'd given up on the green sauce, until a coworker brought back leftovers of their Melrose Pesto at Nora's.  I ate it the next day for lunch, and immediately knew that I had to try that on my next visit.  I was able to do just that this week, and here I am anxiously waiting for my next meal there.  Also of note is the skill of the bartenders.  They make some well crafted cocktails, and outside of Downtown Cocktail Room, this is the only other place that I trust to make me an Old Fashioned.  Nora's makes it to my list of repeat eats.",

The Chicken Marsala is Awesome, The Chicken Carciofe is Amazing, The Baked Ziti is very rich and decadent, if you order it split it with someone, as you can't finish it due to it being so rich, but it is delicious! For a lighter fare, order the Orange Roughy lunch, it is pan seared with Oil & Garlic, and has a light crispy crust and is served with a small house salad.

Anyway back to the Misto!  Which is all we've tried, besides the salad and bread,and it is out-of-this-WORLD!   Make sure you save most of the garlic bread, to dip in the sauce of the dish, ooooooh, awwwwww, mmmmmm, I tingle all over just thinking about it, yum yum yum yummy!    OK, sorry I'm back, :-) So, we split a salad and the Misto, and that's the PERFECT lunch! It's one of those meals that you get to remember hours later, and wonder when you'll get again. Something so delicious that you don't want to eat to often, for fear of it losing it's appeal.    Oh yeah, if you don't  like garlic, this isn't the dish for you ;~D",

Service was great and the prices were affordable.   We'll be back the next time we're in Las Vegas.",

I always get something with an alfredo sauce, and it drives me nuts when it has been sitting even for  a short time, as it starts to dry up fast. I have been here twice, and it was 100% fresh, and the flavor was great!!! Price was good, since it was off the strip, yet the quality and flavor still beats the higher priced places. Service was amazing, just be sure to get a reservation. All the locals know and it fills up fast!",

Last night we arrived with a large group, only to be told that they did not have our reservation.  The hostess was completely unapologetic and acted as though we were just imagining the fact that we had made a reservation and not that Nora's may have lost it.  We were then told that it would be a 30 minute wait, which actually turned out to be 90 minutes.  And when being seated, the hostess was again rude and unapologetic, slamming down menus and silverware when she had to set the table again because it wasn't the right size to accommodate our group.  Our server was very nice, but slow and inattentive.  I'd be hesitant to take a large party here ever again, especially if there are children in the group.  The front of the house staff just isn't knowledgeable or professional enough to deal with something like a lost reservation.",

    "text": "My Family and I have been visiting Nora's for a few years now and we loved the place. The way it was an old mom and pop type of place had a very appealing draw to it. Old school pizzeria with an added sit down Italian restaurant attached. Not over fancy not over bright a nice welcome relaxing place.   It was my sons 18th Birthday and he decided to return to Nora's. But at this point they had moved to the new location. I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it.  Its way to Modern for my taste. high ceiling fancy this fancy that, It lost its down home appeal. Was not warm and inviting at all. the staff even seemed to be stuffy.     We ordered our apps and they came out on a timely manner, and where ok.. I think part of them sat on the pass for a it as they where warm at best.  Items you would think would come out with certain dishes we had to ask for exp. ( ordered sauce for the bread but no spoon to dish it out with.) Large salad to share yet no extra plates for the salad i guess we where suppose to use the app plates which had sauce all over them.    After Looking over the menu we noticed there was nothing listed for kids. So we asked or sever if there was a child menu. She told us they did not have one but we could order small pasta or pizza..  Who doesn't have a kids menu?     Our main dishes seemed to take for ever to come out. When they did again half seemed to have been held at the pass under warming lights. They where on the drying side and not as hot as they should have been. I had the Chicken parm, it was very tough and on the edge of drying out. The Breading was soft and tasted like rye bread.. The noodles that came with it where way to al dente like the where rushing to get food out..  The food was also very lacking in flavor.. I use to love the old school tastes here, its almost as if they went to cans and boxes. other pastas in out group where the same not cooked enough and lacking a good portion of sauce. so barley covered the noodles.      The staff was friendly but not warm. They where moving tables much like any other fancy place in town it become numbers not family. They have definitely lost the good old home feeling which we so liked..      I doubt I will return, have had better food at Olive Garden to be honest compared to this visit..  Congratulations Nora's for stepping into the uppity fancy bland like everyone else's restaurant.",

This new facility is a great place. They did a good job with the decor. But let's get to the main thing for a restaurant: food. This is an Italian restaurant, and my pasta was overcooked. It's the second time I go there bringing a large party with me, and I have to say the quality is not as expected. I don't know what changed when they moved, but I'm kind of regretting the old location now. OK, this one's bigger, brighter, bolder, but again the food is not as good as it used to be. The staff is very nice though.",

Then the lighting was that of a cafeteria scene. This is supposed to be a nice Italian restaurant. Not McDonalds . It was noisy. We might as well of went to a buffet for the ambience and the food quality. Food was greasy and had no flavor . Terrible experience.  Won't try again .",

The bartenders were professional, and very attentive. Our waiter was great and very knowledgeable of the menu. We were low on water, and had to ask for a refill which again is understandable at a very busy restaurant. Nonetheless, our party had a great dining experience.

He was more polite as a server than a stuck up manager with no personality.  But I guess sometimes \"titles\" get the best of a person and seems as if they no longer need to be hospitable.  Their lack of professionalism just shows enough that I guess sometimes a place of establishment just has to settle for what they can to fit the title.  I also want to call out on a female server who drop my husband expensive name brand glasses off the table and nonchalant basically said \"oops\" rather than apologizing for her mistake!!  .... Many more I would love to call out, but I rather keep it short n simple!!!! .... Would I STILL recommend this place.... YES,  I still would recommend this place to others even if the customer service needs improvement!!!!!",

Nora's is a more upscale Italian restaurant and now they finally have the location that expresses how great they are. This family owned restaurant serves up great food with amazing customer service.   Food:  For all the carb lovers, this place is a must go! You start off with some amazing garlic bread! This is made with fresh garlic and grilled to perfection.  For starters, their salads here are AMAZING! They have the greatest antipasto salad I've ever had with a rolled up cheese/meat combination thrown into a great, fresh salad  The crazy alfredo is the best item on the menu (and quite possibly the best item at any Italian restaurant). This is a must try!!  For desserts we had the luxury to try the cannoli and Tiramisu. Both are five star and must at this restaurant.   Service: we went on one of the busiest nights (Saturday on Valentine's Day weekend). And with that, the service was phenomenal. With a reservation, we were sitting down within 15 min and our appetizer was at our table within 5 min after ordering.   I must acknowledge 2 people who went out of their way to make my Valentine's Day that much better! Jessika and Dayton both WENT ABOVE and BEYOND to make an amazing experience.   Price: $15-$20 per entree. Our bill was $61 for 2 people (but we did get appetizers).",

    "text": "Best of Las Vegas in 1996, 2001 and 2009.  On my menu....  Trying to keep track of what someone else is consuming is a pain. I'll just recite what I had yesterday...  Garlic Bread (*** Complimentary) Unlike other patrons of Nora's... was not overly impressed with this Garlic Bread. We had two to three re-fills, and each refill was not consistent with any previous refill. Bread not up to par with the rest of the meal...  Alla Nora (**** 1/2 $10.50) Spaghetti, Eggplant, Ground Beef, Tomato Sauce, Pesto, and a variety of Cheeses with a light layer of Breading on top thrown together into a Bowl and baked until the surface is lightly crusty. I told you I was going to have this entree on my next visit! Did not disappoint!  Carafe of Sangria (****) Sangria is supposed to be the Wine Punch of Spain... what is it doing on the menu of an Italian restaurant? The Red Wine was light and dry... but in Nora's version the Fruit, either sliced or chopped was missing or in small supply. Would have been more refreshing with more Fruitiness.  Service was business-like and efficient... and distant. My favorite Italian, where I live, the owner is quite a bit friendlier and attentive... and hand-kissing towards the fairer sex. Maybe I didn't notice it on my first visit, but I was sitting on one of the outside seats of the table.... and caught my attention very quickly. Waiters a little too brusque for me... maybe they weren't Italian!  We got to Nora's around 5pm to 6pm, and there was no problem getting in and, most importantly, no waiting! But... after we got seated, the rush of diners started.",

Shrimp scampi was my favorite, but the caprese salad (buffalo mozz - oh so delightful!!), focaccia bread, garlic bread, antipasto salad...it was all amazing.  The service was fantastic as well; so were the espresso martinis we had for dessert.  Next time, I'm trying a full meal.  Thank you, Nora's!",

By referral, we found Nora's. Thank God (we visit often). Needless to say we have visited Nora's many (did I say MANY?) times. It is fabulous. Get a reservation and go hungry. Everything from the bread basket to the Crazy Alfredo is delish. Went with my husband and 2 friends, they all dream of, ordered and LOVED the Crazy Alfredo. We all started with Caesar's salad (great!) and I had the Cannelloni. Holy, cheesy delicious yumminess. I am a picky eater, more of a \"many small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large(r) meals\", I cleaned my plate, licked it clean. Prices are as crazy (good) as the alfredo! Go. Don't tell the tourists though, this is a GEM of a locals spot!!!!",

Who stood near our table clicking her pen or flicking the pen cap while very loudly speaking that she needed our table table for a six top.   We were  a party of four who ordered drinks apps entrees and desserts.  We were there for two hours.  I have worked in food service for a long time and I think this behavior is completely unacceptable.   Basically this woman ruined the night. That is the last memory I have of your restaurant.

    "text": "Our dinner last night at Nora's was our fourth since we discovered it about ten years ago when we asked an Italian employee at the Venetian where to get great Italian food in Las Vegas. He said quite assuredly, \"Let me tell you about all the restaurants in the Venetian.\" Then he leaned in and whispered, \"Now let me tell you where to go eat. Nora's.\"   His recommendation was a good one!   Our first visit to Nora's was probably our best experience - the flush of \"first love\" for what was at the time a little known, truly \"mom and pop\" venture located about four miles off the strip and tucked behind an Arby's in a strip mall.. There were four of us, close friends, we walked in on a Friday night without reservations and ate in the bar...which may even have been the only eating area at the time...where we had a wonderful pasta entrees, shared appetizers and desserts and with bottle of Sicilian red wine and the entire bill was just about $100.   Time marches on, Nora's has been discovered (even it seems through a visit from Food Network - alas).  Reservations are not only recommended but essential.  The wine prices have gone WAY up. The menu seems to have been pretty static for each of our four visits to Nora's  and while our meal last night was good, and we still recommend it to those who want traditional Southern italian food, there are so many options now in Las Vegas for Italian fare that our visit last night may have been our last to our \"old friend\". (One of those options is Nora's Wine Bar, owned by the \"sons of Nora\".)   The low point of the meal for two at Nora's last night was the antipasta.  Nora's preparation, with Italian deli meat, canned black olive slices and grated mozzarella on top of blandly dressed lettuce, just didn't \"cut it\".  But the linguini friutti di mare that followed was wonderfully prepared with succulent mussels, clam (not in shells), shrimp and calamari rings and tentacles (yesssss) in a well seasoned red sauce. A glass of Barbara and a glass of Nebbiolo plus two desserts (espresso tartufo and cannoli) brought our bill to about $75 which we thought was a good value for the quality of the meal and the friendly service.   The yelp reviewers who have cheered about the chocolate cake are right...the Valrohna chocolate cake with the molten center that is served warm is delicious. But the espresso tartufo, coated in a chocolate shell, and the cannoli are both worthy contenders.  The tartufo may be among the best we've ever had of that dessert option.   We noted that on a Tuesday night in a bad economy, Nora's was still doing gangbusters. all tables full by about 8:00 in a mix of what seemed to be local regulars and tourists like us. The enduring popularity of this little place is well earned.",

With the crowd coming to eat in those numbers on a Thursday, it is impressive.   Little events were off throughout the dinner, but the food was good enough to overlook them. A wine/cocktail menu was not presented until I asked. A talk with Robyn L. a while ago had me searching for the Pilgrim's Passion. Ordered that for my friend and I got the Berry Explosive. Both were amazing and worth the $9. It took some time for them to come to the table. I wouldn't have noticed if the waitress didn't come to apologize, so that was nice.  The garlic bread came out to tide us over. Surprising that the basket had about ten pieces in it. All were heavy on the garlic. I could smell it when brushing teeth later that night. Oh baby, does that turn you on? They ran the gambit in texture though. Some were burnt, some crunchy, while others were soft and drenched in butter. Most were edible and enjoyable. Dinner is more fun when playing roulette with free items.   At least there was no losing in dinner. I had ordered the Alla Nora and it was a bountiful feast. A pile of spaghetti topped in meat sauce, eggplant, and cheese is thrown in the oven or a salamander to give a nice crust. My friends were also as happy with their Tomato Basil Pasta and Crazy Alfredo. Packing most of the dish to go home, I am looking forward to tomorrow, because I always enjoy cold pasta for breakfast.",

    "text": "Will absolutely be back. Highly recommend!  Called midweek for a same day reservation. They said 9pm was the earliest. We showed up 30 minutes early and they sat us promptly. 5 star   Didn't care for my table that much. It was a small 2 person table against the wall crammed next to a stage. But we had a table, and the place was packed.. walk ins were being told long wait times, so I cant complain. In the future I might request not having that table again.  4 star  Wine list was solid and sure to have something for most people though I wish it had a few more options in the 100-200 range. 4 star  After I ordered a bottle of amarone it arrived with a decanter and the waiter proceeded to open it. What shocked me was the battery powered aerator that was used during the pour from the bottle to the decanter. Our first course was tomato bruschetta. The nice thing about mid age armarone for me is the way it opens up over the meal. The acidity would have paired perfect with the ripe tomatoes, and later on, after it sat for 30 minutes in the decanter, it would have opened up perfectly for the main courses. I didn't get to enjoy that experience. What I got was a wine that tasted like it had just been through a blender. 2 star  Tomato Bruschetta was decent, but I wasn't a huge fan. The baguette was fresh but had been soaked in way to much olive oil. The tomatoes were cut too large to eat on a baguette without falling off and I never got the flavor of garlic, basil and pepper. Not to say there wasn't any but for me it was bland. On the positive side my girlfriend highly enjoyed the generous portion of tomatoes, almost twice as much as you would normally see on this type of dish. 3 star  For the main I ordered the crazy alfredo and it was amazing. Packed with mushrooms and peppers.. pasta just right... topped with awesome shrimp... the sauce was perfect! This dish is divine. 5 star  She had the spaghetti and meat balls. The meatballs were enormous and very good but the noodles were served soft. In an Italian restaurant, we were expecting al dente. It wasn't spaghetti either, it was more like spaghettini. Overall a decent dish but I had higher hopes. 4 star  We pre ordered the souffle for dessert. NOM NOM 5 star  It was so good it has inspired me to create my own yelp award. I will call it the Nom Nom award and reserve it for dishes that are so good they make you slow down when eating... enjoying the moment while making cavman like noises with your partner in between the omg this is so freaking good stares you share. Yea, its that good.This dessert is 5 star plus and wins my first nom nom award.  Service was excellent. Staff was busy but not stressed out, everyone was happy. With a full house and a line almost out the door this is a rare combination. Our waiter was prompt, friendly and serviced the table properly. Our wine and water stayed full and the table was kept neat by the busser. 5 star  Over all a solid 4 with potential for more when I go back and sample their pizzas and other offerings.",

Usually I add in a salad to help balance out the guilt of this dish. The bar is always hopping as well as the rest of the restaurant. Also one of the best BBQ chicken pizzas in Vegas. Perfectly balanced with BBQ sauce. Lots of great dishes to choose from, only problem is that it is hard to choose. Great service with a smile.  Can't say that I have ever had a bad meal here.

I just recently got together with my Family and the subject of \"Las Vegas\" came up and all agreed that the next visit to \"Vegas\" has to include a trip back to \"Nora's\"",

    "text": "I had heard so much about this restaurant and was really looking forward to going there. However, our whole group was fairly disappointed by the experience. The prices are reasonable, but I expected so much more on the taste of the dishes. I ordered the gnocchi and my husband had the alla nora, which is supposed to be one of their specialties. Both of these dishes were just ok; they weren't anything special at all. The tomato sauce on top of the gnocchi honestly reminded me of Chef Boyardee. The house salad that we ordered was also nothing special. The only good part of the meal was the pesto that my sister ordered. The service was inconsistent. The guy who brought our drinks and bread was very friendly and nice. However, the waitress and the person who dropped off our entrees were indifferent. The woman who served our entrees basically just dropped the plates on our table without a word or smile. The restaurant was super busy, so I don't know if it was just our table that wasn't having a great time, but I was expecting so much better from this place.",

He didn't offer a tour of the menu but he did ask if we had any questions. The server was pleasant and respectful. We got a nice Cabernet by the glass I asked him to bring me what he liked. I got a salad as my appetizers i think it was called greens and Farro. The salad was crisp, but a little salty; all balanced with the dressing. I also ordered the filet with roasted veggies it was amazing!!!! Hot and buttered no sauce needed ! We were so full we had no room for dessert. Thank you Nora for the delicious meal !",

We mentioned to the waitress that the pasta was a bit salty and she was quick to suggest a replacement for us and didnt charge us for it. She also gave us complimentary coffee and cappuccinos with our cannoli. The cannoli was quite hard, but the filling was creamy and delicious. I would also say the calamari is some of the best I've had! We would definitely like to come back and try some more of the pasta options and tiramisu.",

    "text": "Nora's has been around for a long time and prior to the past two times I have eaten there, it was always consistent and good. I am not sure what happened after they moved to their new building but I am just not a fan anymore. Sometimes when a place moves locations, something about the old kitchen doesn't travel with them. Sadly, I have eaten here twice this year and both times were a let down.  The service is still great but the food has become very mediocre. I always recommended Nora's to others for a great Italian meal, now not so much. The wine list is still outstanding with so many top wineries featured and options. The atmosphere is on trend, lively and enjoyable.The new space is open and also features patio dining always a plus in Las Vegas.  This particular time we joined friends to celebrate our anniversary since we all got married the same day. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with a caesars salad and hubby ordered the lasagna. It wasn't that my entree was not good, it was just very ordinary. All that was featured was the chicken, marsala sauce and mushrooms. Some garlic mashed potatoes would have been nice along with some carrots. I guess I was looking to be wowed but it didn't happen. Perhaps I made the wrong choice too. My husband said his lasagna was nothing outstanding either which surprised me as Nora's pasta dishes have always been very tasty. Dessert was a nice treat from Nora's and appreciated by both couples!   Maybe the two times I have dined here this year have just been off nights. I don't want to say I will never come back but this place has just moved down on my list of recommendations.I hope the old Nora's comes back some day with the tasty dishes of the past.",

They have an extensive menu and wine list, so it was a difficult choice to make, but we started with the antipasto salad to share then I had the shrimp primavera as an entree. The antipasto was delicious and HUGE and was accompanied by fresh herbtastic bread. I was nearly full before our entrees arrived! The shrimp primavera was out of this world and they vary the price by the number of shrimp you would like in it. Portions are sizable and my husband and I could've easily just shared an entree after that salad.   I'm giving it 4-Stars simply because they are heavy handed with the butter/oil in their pasta and that kind of gave me a stomach ache :/",

The chef that starts his ragu with food can rather than fresh vegetable base. The guy that drizzles aged balsamic over some lettuce like my 6 years old niece can't do the same thing. I mean, i just had to get this out of my chest, its so frustrating spending money in a restaurant whose dishes don't have any produce quality nor proper culinary principles behind. Come on....juliene celery sticks with octopus???",

It was my first time eating here and I really liked. We had a party of 10 so they placed in us a private room with a tv, music and lights we could control.  When we sat down they gave us baskets of garlic bread to hold us over until we got our actual food. I ordered the gnocchi in vodka sauce and it was delicious. The price of food was fairly cheap  $12-$25 a plate depending if you got meat or not.  I really like it and it is for sure one of my favorite Las Vegas italian spots!  Update: still love this place and Kara is the best waitress. Very attentive, polite and social. She was able to handle us weirdos. That's always a plus. :)",

    "text": "I was glad to be back at Nora's after almost 1 year without visiting. I'm glad to see them succeed and moved to a bigger location. We called on a weekday and they had a table. When we arrived we were surprised they were not packed.   The Restaurant: The new location is wonderful, it's a nice big building with outdoor patio. They have private rooms for family or corporate event, bar seating, outdoor and regular seating. The interior looks traditional, casual and cute. I used their restrooms and they were extremely clean.    The Food: The food was amazing! Better than what I remembered! We all got cocktails to start. I got a \"Pisco Sour\" I know this is an Italian restaurant, but they make really good pisco, we also got beers and \"Old Fashion.\" Our waitress brought us some \"garlic bread for the table\" and got our orders. We decided to start with an \"Antipasto Salad\" they are family style, so it was big enough to share for the 4 of us.  For main curses we had:  \"Chicken Marsala\" it come with spaghetti on the side, delicious marsala sauce and chicken cooked perfectly.  \"Rack of Lamb\" delicious lamb in a special sauce cooked to your request served with veggies.  I had the \"Frutti Di Mare\" linguini with shrimp, mussels, calamari, clams cooked in a flavorful marinara sauce. My plate was spectacular! I love it! It was too much, and I couldn't finish it.  I switched to wine when the food arrived, the waitress recommended a pinot noir to pair with dinner.   The desserts were just OK, honestly nothing too special. We had \"Tiramisu\" and \"Bread Pudding\"  The Service: Although we had a great experience food wise, we are all considering going back because the service that night, were they didn't have many customers was super slow! It took us about 2 hours! She barely checked on us and when we told her we wanted some dessert it took her about 30 more minutes. At the end when we requested for the check we just decided to stand up and pay to the casher because we were afraid it would take any longer. It's a pity because like I said the food was better than what I remembered but honestly after a long day working you want to enjoy dinner without crossing the line were dinner becomes a painful wait.      Overall: 4 Stars excellent food but the wait became painful and kind of ruined the experience for us and friends.",

We came in knowing what we wanted.... The Grilled Branzino! Listen up seafood lovers!!..... This is the BEST fish I've ordered in my life! I was in my happy place this entire meal! It's a whole sea bass grilled (the way they do it in Italy, Greece, Israel, etc) don't ask me why but for some reason it's really hard to find fish served this way in Las Vegas.  Our son got pasta and he too was happy with his meal, LOL! We ordered the marinated olives as an appetizer along with a white wine from Sonoma,CA (forget which one it was but it went really well with the Branzino)....we got espresso at the end of the meal.  Our food was excellent, our server was super nice, everything was lovely! 5 full stars you guys!",

We ordered the large antipasti salad. Honestly it could feed 4 if you share! I loved it! Very generous portion, tasty and refreshing. We shared a tagliatelle alla carbonara. It was the closest italian carbonara I ever had! It made my night :) We came around 9pm and got a table right away. I know for sure that you need a booking even the restaurant is spacious.

We didn't have time for reservations and really didn't want to wait either so we figured will walk-in & see. Place was busy, but we were greeted at the door by hostess and advised next reservation wasn't until 8pm, it was 630.. but if we wanted to wait she could get us in like 20mins but seating outside was right away. Being that it was hot I didn't want outside but after 10mins of waiting I said WTH, lol. It turned out really nice- misters were on, there was a light breeze so win-win.  Our waiter came, Adam was his name.. got our drinks nothing fancy water & soda, our appetizers- I had clams (I kno not really Carnivore-ish but I missed them) and hubs had pork belly w/beans.. omg both dish were amazingly delish! For main course I had a rib eye only rare and hubs had chicken parm. Got our meal, looks great but my meat was not rare, it wasn't even med-rare, it's was more medium.. I don't like to complain but we are talking about a $32 piece of meat here.. soo I Nonchalantly mentioned to Adam it wasn't rare when he came over. He immediately said I'll have the chef make another. He apologized like crazy, then the Manager Gabriella (?) came out & she apologized as well after she mentioned Adam had spoken to her. My new steak came out, still not rare but atleast not over cooked, more like medium to rare in certain spots if that makes sense. Lol. Anyway again Adam came to check and I shook my head to say no but that I wasn't going to send it back. I would just deal with it and that it wasn't his fault. Gabriella came back out feeling so bad, again not her fault. Adam surprised us with dessert, a beautiful tasty cannoli which really wasn't nec along with our bill which was adjusted, again not nec. Having worked in the restaurants biz myself growing up I know how waiter/waitress are blamed a lot for cooks/chef actions. Nora's kitchen went above & beyond with their customer service. I give it 5 stars because despite the little mishap from kitchen, the customer service was outstanding & so was the food to be honest. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you Adam & manager Gabriella for making our 1st time a memorable one. Keep up the great service! Ps- The busser/water guy was great too, we never had to ask for drinks, he was on top of it!",

Restaurant was full and that's how it is every night so I suggest you make a reservation. The restaurant is beautiful and there are separate dining rooms to eat in. We were seated in the far left dining room I am hoping to come back and sit on the right side where they have their wines stored. Our waitress Kenya was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. We loved the bread served and started with a small antipasta salad. Perfect size for two! We ordered the sangria to drink! Very tasty! For our mains, we ordered the chicken Marsala and the crazy Alfredo ! The CRAZY ALFREDO is a 10! The chicken Marsala was good but not as much as the pasta. For dessert we ordered the Pannacotta which we devoured. Loved this meal and restaurant would come back over and over.",

The location has plenty of parking spot, and the interior was definitely pretty roomy. We came in right at 12 and it was pretty packed. But we were seated within 5 minutes. I ordered the farm house carbonara (pictured below) and was fairly happy with the taste and portion size. The garlic bread they were serving was good as well.  The reason why I'm putting the rating at four is because the wait for the food was a bit ridiculous. I understand it was pretty crowded but it took us about 1.5 hours to get our food after we put in our orders. If you plan on coming here for lunch make sure you don't have a meeting to get back to because you'll run the risk of missing it.   Other then that, overall happy with the food and services provided.",

He had steak and I had organic chicken (even though I didn't care too much for the accompanying vegetables I still fully enjoyed my meal). Chicken was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious! Our appetizer (rice balls) was excellent. They have very good wine list as well.  Chocolate cake/souffle type dessert was not on their dessert menu, but I'm glad my husband spotted it on the table next to us. You have to wait 15 mins for it to be served but it was well worth the wait!!! My husband would liked it to be more hot but as to my taste, it was perfect!! I wanted more!!! It was chocolate heaven.  Our waitress was extremely pleasant. Wish I remembered her name (she was tall, skinny blond young girl). Our waters and drinks were never empty and if we needed her, she was always around. But not to the point to be annoying and overly attentive. Very pleased with her! My only suggestion is to have more options for the little ones. There were a lot of families with kids, including us, but pretty much the only option for our son was spaghetti. Which was very tasty for just pasta with butter. But still.. Maybe they have good explanation to why they don't offer it.. Anyway, I would recommend this restaurant and make sure you make reservation. It fills up very fast!",

    "text": "Nora's Nora's let's see... I was thoroughly irritated with my first visit here because of a combination of things. For starters I was invited here on a date and reservations were for 7:15 PM. We weren't seated until about 7:45PM. I was on the verge of just saying you know what this isn't cool and walking out. Of course as soon as this almost happened we were called to our table. What is the point of a reservation if you can't be seated on time or at least within a reasonable grace period after that? The two hostesses working seemed overwhelmed and clueless. Oh but I wasn't alone in the not being seated for a reservation fiasco! There had to be about 3 other parties that were also waiting to be seated and inquiring frequently since we all couldn't pile up in the doorway.. Who would've known that this place would be jumping like this on a Thursday night? Anyways...  We were seated and immediately greeted. The server was cool nothing much to say about him he did his job. Usually when you ask somebody if it's there first time and they respond yes you start off with some possible suggestions..  Whatev...I guess that's not apart of the job description though. Moving on to the food.   Appetizers:  House Salad (Romaine Lettuce, Mozzarella, Olives, Onions, Tomatoes, Pepperoncini, Homemade Italian Dressing)  Mozzarella Caprese Salad (Tomatoes, Basil, Rosemary-Garlic EVOO)  Entree's:  Crazy Alfredo (Fettucini, Chicken, Sausage, Shrimp, Porcini Mushrooms, Mushrooms, Roasted Bell Peppers, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Jalapenos)  Chicken Carciofi (Tomato, Artichokes, Capers, Linguini, White Wine Sauce)  Conclusion: The food overall was pretty good no complaints on that. If you love pasta then definitely you can't go wrong with the \"Crazy Alfredo\"! My Mozzarella Caprese was good as well. My last complaint which cost them another star was the fact that when we asked for to go boxes the waiter brought them back and gave us the wrong damn to-go boxes. Nothing like getting home from dinner with somebody and finding out that you got the other persons food. And in my case this was a date..so imagine how awkward that was for me?.. Eh I may try again who knows....",

    "text": "I have to start backwards, with the leftovers:  Rigatoni with Chicken in Gorgonzola Sauce.   Not my dish, but my husband's.  It became mine the next night, after he went to a dinner-included activity and I delayed my own dinner until I returned hungry from my own evening out.  He sat at the table, hyperventilating from the aroma and the seductive memory of the the night before ;)  But I didn't let him have one bite! It was even better the second time; some of the fat from the cheese melted away, and the flavors melded together even better.  When I finished, I tried to figure out how soon in this holiday-heavy season we'll be able to go back.  Two days later, and I'm still jonesin' for that dish.  It was a while in coming: two previous attempts to make a reservation got shot down, but on a Tuesday night we were \"allowed\" to dine at 9:00 p.m., and found the place mobbed.  Incredible.  So why not five stars?  After all, the house salad that we shared was pretty damned nice, too, even though I don't eat olives or pepperoncini.  But Herb does, and when it was served we thought they had mistakenly brought us the large size.  And tasty, complimentary garlic bread was a delicious touch.  The service was terrific, too, with our waiter available when we needed him, but not overly obtrusive.  We were, sadly, disappointed in the Chicken Marsala.  Perfectly pretty spaghetti accompanied it, and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  But the sauce was overwhelming sweet, overwhelmingly drowning the chicken, and frankly, the portion - compared to everything else we had, and saw on other tables - seemed very skimpy.  I can't remember the last time I disliked this dish, except maybe in a New Jersey diner.  I also found the prices to be all over the place.   There's something for everyone, but if you're on a budget, many items seemed priced too high.  And that goes for the award-winning wine list, too - wine prices are steep.  Our total bill was reasonable, but we're not big eaters and usually don't eat red meat or seafood.  I can see why Nora's has such great ratings.  I recommend it highly, and will go back as soon as possible.  But for me, that fifth star is elusive.",

    "text": "Nice decor and setup - with the central bar breaking up the large space into smaller rooms.  Food was excellent - flavorful, moist, not too salty, and deserts not too sweet - and presented nicely. Dishes are pretty big, so in retrospect some of us could have shared, but it was better to get to try more.  We had the chicken caprese, the sea bass with arugula, the homemade tasting sausage with broiled vegetables, and a side of roasted potatoes (necessary for the sausage), downed with chianti. For desert we had the gelato layered cake,  tiramisu, and cannoli. All very good.  Yes, none of us like pasta, so we were happy that there were so many non-pasta options.  My only complaint is that the tiramisu, which, although perfectly soft and moist and light-rich balance, didn't have any coffee flavor. I enjoyed it anyway because of its other qualities.  The waiters were very attentive and easy to call if needed. One injured person in our group needed to change the (too soft) dining chair for a harder one from outside, and they did it quickly.  Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time. Was unable to make a reservation at the time we wanted due to it being so busy. We were able to get a table for 4 at 8.30 pm. The place was PACKED. Hardly any parking and every single table was full. Very little waiting area near the hostess booth.  However, we were seated right at 8.30 pm, so that wasn't a problem.  I ordered the Frutti di Mare, which is mussels, calamari, clams, and fish over linguini (red sauce). Big disappointment on the mussels. There were only 4 and they were very very briny and fishy tasting, leading me to believe they were not fresh. I'm from Southern Italy. I pretty much started eating mussels out of the womb, they shouldn't taste like that.   The calms were un-shelled and mixed in with the pasta. I would much rather have them in the shell. In the sauce, you lose the flavor of the clams. Overall, pasta was cooked well and sauce was good. But for $22, not worth it. Calamari tubes are really cheap and the plate was loaded with it. They need to knock down the price of this dish.   Our waitress did not bring us water, even though we asked multiple times. We all left parched.  I'd like to come back and give this place another try.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Nora's. I don't frequent Italian food as it is a little too heavy for me sometimes and when I do I usually just go to Maggiano's or Brio, but upon a recommendation I came here. It was definitely a great choice.  The ambiance was very nice, upon entry it seemed very classy and upscale, but don't be fooled--the prices are very affordable. We were greeted by very sweet hostesses and seated immediately.   The menu is not too overwhelming. There were a lot of options, but not too menu that you don't know where to look first. It's also nicely sectioned off hy what kind of dish you are looking for--meat, seafood, pasta, etc. As an OCD list maker, I appreciated that.   The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the crazy alfredo and was blown away! I love my food spicy and the one thing about pasta is that other than red pepper flakes added after the dish is served, it is not usually spicy. This dish had jalapenos in it and while I am not a fan of jalapenos, I thoroughly enjoyed the spiciness it added to the dish.   The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because we waited quite awhile for the garlic bread to come out. I had previously looked up Nora's on Yelp and had read that their garlic bread is the best in town so I was anxiously waiting for it. Which by the way is completely TRUE. BEST GARLIC BREAD OF MY LIFE!",

We plan to visit Nora's each time we are in Vegas.  I had the popular dish crazy Alfredo, however I asked for gnocchi. Can I tell you that entree was to die for.  I wish I had a plate right now! There are not enough words to describe my pleasure.  As soon as we walked in the fresh herbs and Aroma fragrance the entire place.   We literally observed  a customer  swiftly  walking to the restaurant as we parked and thought oh my this place must be the bomb.  Also did I tell you our server Don was the best.  Nora's was perfect! You must give it a try.  I have already told a few of my co workers to try Nora's when visiting Vegas.  Please tell Don we said Hello",

Indoor and outdoor seating, bar plus private seating options. Ambiance is rustic and warm. A great place for a nice date or fancy birthday dinner. Menu options are plentiful. Price point is reasonable for the quality of food and service. I had the Pappardelle Luisa which is a house speciality. It is probably the best pasta I've ever had from the fresh made pappardelle to the alluring white wine sauce. I could literally eat this pasta everyday for the rest of my life, it's that good. So glad we dropped in. If you are feigning for real Italian cuisine, or planning date night, Nora's is it.",

While the food was pretty darn good (enough to overcome sending back the Veal and Molten cake because they were too cold), the biggest bummer was the service. She made no attempt to help us celebrate our anniversary or remedy the not so perfect temperature of the food. And the only reason I am even writing this is, they forgot to bring us our leftovers!!",

My bf and I tried coming here on Valentine's Day, but it was too packed and we agreed we would come back another time.  We went last night and let me tell you it was not worth the hype. We were very disappointed. The waitress was non existent. Never asked us if we wanted anything to drink, and when we did we couldn't find her or anyone to flag down to ask. So we never got drinks other than water. The time from the appetizers to the food was so long, at least 30 minutes.  \"That's okay, it'll be worth the wait\", or so I thought.. but the sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  It was not good at all. Not one of us (party of 4) ate our meals and no one even asked why. Then we were just sitting around waiting for someone to clear our table, ask if we want dessert, give us the check, etc. no one ever came. My boyfriend had to get up and go to the kitchen where the waiter/waitress stand with the cash register is and ask for our check!!! Yes he had to get up and get his own check because no one ever came! I can't believe I was excited about this place. We left extreme minimal tip, and even that was being generous. I don't like to pay for service I don't receive. I will never recommend noras Italian cuisine to anyone, in fact, I will tell people to stay away from it.",

The side of pasta had about two tablespoons of sauce, also not flavorful. My husband's sausage did not taste like sausage, also not flavorful.   It was very noisy and you could hardly hear each other. But the waiter was very nice and accommodating. May give it one more chance on the patio.",

The Arrabbiata sauce is spicy enough, so good that I get it with angel hair.. Yum! Nice cozy ambiance, great fir a date!",

Also as soon as we sat eventually the waitress didn't seem to customer friendly and when she asked to see our ID's for alcoholic beverages she said that she couldn't tell the difference between the IDs (assuming she thinks all Asians look alike) which also bothered me because the initial issue was lingering.   I like that they give you an extra glass of sangria with the purchase of one and as long as you check in.   Keep in mind I reserved a dinner for 7 because it was one of my family members birthday and I wanted to take her out.   When dinner was finally served everyone got their food except me! Apparently they just forgot to put it in.   When I got the final bill I noticed she didn't charge me for certain things I'm assuming cause she knew I was upset.   Fortunately I'm not an asshole(excuse the language) and still tipped her about 18%.   The food was great I enjoyed my meal, two calamaris we ordered for appetizers. The portions are great I guess personally the restaurant didn't give me a positive vibe.",

The tomato on the pizza looked like they have dumped old cans of tomato on the pizza. It was tasteless. A few hours after eating we both started having terrible stomachaches and coughs. Felt like the food has bleach in it the way it was burning through my colon and throat. I'm never eating at this place ever again, 33 dollars down the drain.",

Calamari was crispy and good, the sauce better than average. This sauce is what keeps this from being a five star review.  The rigatoni was fantastic!

Nora's is the kind of Italian restaurant that you would go to all the time if you lived in Vegas. Just looking around at the packed house you get the feeling that none of the diners are from the hotels. Had a decent veal parm plate. If I would change anything I would stop the use of the salamander.  The hot plate warning when the server delivers the plate has almost always been the first sign of a mediocre meal. This case was different as the veal was delicious and the melted cheese a velvet blanket of goodness. Can't wait to try it again next trip.",

    "text": "Nice Neighborly Vibe and Good Food.....  Pros:   Good portions and value.  Friendly atmosphere.  Not far from the Strip. Cons:  Perhaps too popular?  If you want fancy, look elsewhere.  Ratings: -   Overall:    4 -   Food Quality:  3-4 -   Food Quantity:  4 -   Menu:   4 -   Wine List:   3 -   Service:   5 -   Fancy Factor:   2 -   Neighborly Feel:    5 -   Smell:    5 -   Cost:     4 -   Value:     5  My wife and I, along with 3 other couples from San Jose, traveled to Las Vegas to meet another couple for the husband's 65th birthday.  Friends had a strong recommendation for Nora's from people they trust, so the group agreed to have one of our 3 dinners at this restaurant.  Although we stayed in a hotel along the infamous Strip, Nora's was only a 10 minute cab ride to the west.  As many Yelpers have noted, it's not a fancy place from the outside...and not exactly on the inside either... but some of the best Italian food we've found was in similar surroundings ( like the late lamented Gaetano's in the LA suburb of La Habra and some in our hometown of San Jose ).  We had reservations for 10 people at 915 PM on a Thursday evening, but when we arrived at 9 PM, it was packed.  No surprise according to plenty of reviewers.  But the guy handling reception duties, servers  and even other customers waiting for tables were in a good mood.  Is everyone in Las Vegas a comedian ( or trying to be )?  By the way, there was one promising sign of a happy meal to come.  We all know how big promises can lead to big disappointment, but I've noticed...at least with Italian restaurants...if it smells good in the parking lot, it usually tastes good later on.  Nora's passed the smell test.  Patrons were slow to leave, but one table left at 915 PM so some of the staff rearranged things and our group got into their chairs by 925 PM.  A bit late for me ( I typically start dinner about 7 ), though we were on Vegas time. Although we shared the room with a party of 20 celebrating a birthday, there was no cramping of space for us or several other tables for 2 and 4.  Age has its benefits, but short-term memory is not one of them.  Details on the food have faded into a haze ( maybe from the casino in the Mirage.  What a hell hole! ), but longer lasting impressions are important, too.  The menu was quite large and varied with many favorites recognized from the lists of Italian restaurants in neighborhoods around the country.  Question was...how well did Nora's handle the job?  First thing on the table were loaves of garlic bread.  I usually can't resist that stuff, especially is it's half decent, and it was really good that night.  Or maybe I was just starved.  Either way, after a basket of bread and part of my draft beer, I began to breathe as if the waiter brought a dose of smelling salts.  I'll always remember my mother saying \"don't load up on bread\", but it's a hard habit to break.  Friends passed around several salads, though since I'm not a sharer, I kept my plate behind a moat of utensils.  That's just as well.  I need my own salad every day...and it was quite good.  Nobody at the table voiced any disagreement.  My entree was eggplant parmagiana, which as a \"chicken-fish\" vegetarian, I seem to order a lot of the time.  I'd give it an 8 on a scale of 10.  Not bad!  Good size, texture and tomato taste.  The side order of spaghetti was also respectable.  My wife's chicken marsala was good, but she thought the sauce was too sweet.  I can't remember what our friends had, but nobody raised their hand to complain, at least publicly. By the time we finished at 11 PM, our group of greying baby boomers was a tad tuckered, so we bypassed dessert and called cabs for the short ride back to the Mirage.  We split the bill evenly among the 5 couples and each paid an astoundingly small $44 plus tip.  That's a lotta food in a high priced town.  Service was friendly in a good-natured, smart-alecky way.  The oldest member of the staff I spotted was in his 30's, so it seemed like a bunch of neighborhood kids...the family?...running the restaurant and having fun doing it.  You almost felt like a regular after one visit.  There must be tons of Italian restaurants around Las Vegas, but if you need to get away from crowds in the big hotels, Nora's is a solid choice for eating within a decent distance of your room.",

When Nora's saw who they were, they changed their tune.  All of a sudden, we were okay.  That didn't sit well with me.  I can't tell you if the food was good because my appetite was ruined.  Note to Nora's.  Since that happened, we have never been back and that was about ten years ago.  You should have treated us with respect like your regulars because we could have been new regulars.

The tables are covered in white linens and butcher paper which gives it a formal feel without the pretentiousness and cost. Whenever my parents are in town we head straight to Nora's to appease my Italian loving dad.  The Italian food is hearty and delicious. Every table starts with a basket of crunchy garlic bread. The pieces are covered in garlic and a good size, so you won't feel so guilty about eating 10 of them. You want to order an appetizer, either the mozzarella caprese or an antipasto, trust me they are both seasoned perfectly and hit the spot. My current favorite pasta is the Rigatoni Special, I mean it has meatballs AND sausage, you can't go wrong! I will say that I have had the lasagna and I'm not such a fan. It wasn't really special and I'm pretty sure mine is better. My husband always gets the Pork Tenderloin alla Siciliana. The pork is melt in your mouth tender and the side of potatoes really puts it over the top. My dad is a sucker for their giant bone in Rib-eye, seriously it's giant so bring your appetite. The pizza is just as good as the pasta, but I always end up ordering pasta. Oh and be sure to pre-order the chocolate cake, you want the chocolate cake! It's so melt-ey and molten-ey and lava-ey, all the -ey!  Nora's is really the best bang for your buck when it comes to Italian food in Las Vegas. The prices are good, the ambiance is great, and the food is fantastic!",

Started with the Caprese salad.  Mozzarella was fresh and great flavor.  Split the Crazy Alfredo and it was wonderful too.  Perfect portion for two.  Special attention from the owner put the exclamation mark on the evening.  We will definitely be back anytime we're in Vegas.",

I find that here in Las Vegas its hard to find good service (which is odd because I would have thought the opposite) so I love coming here to dine in because its always a very pleasant experience. Ask for Anthony or Don they are both fantastic and friendly servers. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because their dining rooms are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations. It won't stop me from going back though!",

The pasta is lovely and fresh, and the garlic bread is absolutely wonderful!  (Bring breath mints).  A reasonable wine list rounds out the evening, and the tiramisou haunts my dreams.",

Fortunately we had a rental car, allowing us to drive the 3 or 4 miles to Nora's.  Located in a strip shopping center with limited parking, we never would have guessed that this place would be so good.  The food and service were top-notch and Sinatra was playing in the background.  The garlic bread was delicious, as was the Arancini appetizer, a risotto and cheese starter.  Some of the entrees were so inexpensive that it made us think twice for a moment - $10.50 for a large portion of eggplant parmigiana.  Others in our party ordered chicken, veal, and pasta dishes.  All were very reasonably priced and a nice break from the touristy places in or near the big hotels.  We loved Nora's and will absolutely return the next time we're in Las Vegas.  Thanks to Yelp for the favorable reviews!",

We found this place on Yelp and saw several great reviews. We decided to give it a try.   We made same day reservations and they seated us within 5 minutes even though we were running a little late. When you walk in you're hit by a great smell and the place feels like a happening local food spot.   We had over-eaten all weekend a weren't terribly hungry, so we ordered a little lite. We split the Veal Marsala. Incredible sauce and great meat. It was the best Marsala sauce we've ever tried. It came with a side of spaghetti that was good as well. We also had a bowl of pasta soup (Farmagiano?) that was huge, hearty (filled with beans and pasta shells) an was great. I had a gratis glass of house red via our friends at yelp and we were out the door for $30.   If you're looking for a friendly, home style change of pace from the big-ness of Vegas, and are craving great and affordable Italian food, do yourself a favor and check this place out. Highly recommended.",

They explained that since that time wasn't available it automatically made the reservation for the following night??? They did fit us in. The place was busy but dinner took us 2 1/2 hours. They messed up the cocktails twice. When asked where they were, she went back to check and never came back. The manager (not sure since he didn't his position) came over to ask if there was anything we need and I explained how my cocktail never arrived and that I had asked our server about it. He said he'd check. I said that if it was up already to just cancel it since the wine that we ordered should be arriving soon. Never heard back but the wine arrived 15 minutes later. Unfortunately the food didn't. When it did it was good which is normal for Nora's. Then the computer system supposedly when down and our bill took another 20 minutes to get to us. Overall, not a good experience. As the events continued to spiral out of control, the server nor the night manager ever came over to keep us updated nor to just say sorry for the missteps. The front of the house doesn't seem to have a good handle on what's going on or maybe they don't value their customers dining experience???",

You could tell because the noddles were losing there color n it was like eating mushy French bread. My wife's spaghetti and meat sauce tasted like the sauce was burnt or that taste it gets when cooked over and over again as my dad would say (he and his brothers own Commini's restaurant in Trenton, NJ before they sold it and taght me that).  The Italian sausage on the side I asked for was good.  My daughter liked her linguini and clams and I tasted it and it was pretty good. Her desert was good too.  My cheesecake was very disappointing.  It was no bigger in diameter than a planters peanut can n only an inch thick n 1/4 was icing and another was the crust. All i could taste was the crust. The coffee was watered down and did not taste like Lav Azza (all I drink at home btw) but more like Folgers so Idk if they actually serve Lav Azza but it was written on the cup so we think they are supposed too.  I won't go back and will stick with the authentic Italian one we found on eastern ave in Henderson.",

My family and I ordered salads to start and then we got a  pizza and 2 pastas.  Salad:  I had the Caesar and my mom had the house. Way too much dressing and cheeses on both.   Pizza and Pasta:  The pizza was ok and the pasta again was nice, cooked on point but again way too saucy. Almost overwhelming.   Service:  We were a table of 3. We did not order anything complicated.  We did not leave until 9:37 pm. It took almost 50 minutes from the time that we finished our salad to get our entree. Absurd!  The waitress did come by and say it would be just a few more minutes however that's just nonsense. There was a large table of 12 that they needed to serve before us apparently and that is why the wait was so long. We were about 5 minutes from walking out.  Management seemed to be more focused on the locals at the bar as opposed to getting the food out. Disappointing.   No one should have to wait that long for decent if not average food. Quite disappointing considering all of the '5 star' reviews. Not worth it.",

The main courses were only mediocre at best. I had the veal marsala, which the meat was over cooked and the wine mushroom glaze while providing excellent initial taste had a horrible bitter finish. My girlfriend had the Frutti De Mare which the pasta and sauce were very well done but the seafood was cooked too long which resulted in rubberized morsels. Overall it must have been an off night, I will go back again, but was not impressed with my first time going. On a side note the wait staff was top notch and very attentive.",

I have been a frequent diner for over 10 years, loved the old space and the controlled chaos and of course the food. My first experience was better than my latest. Food seemed to be the same quality my first go around. This time, not so much ... salty, 3 small average meatballs and not the 2 delicious meatballs that were standard. Our waiter was awesome upon arrival, but was over worked and distracted by the end.  He told us he had to pull our appetizers and plates because our entrees were ready and continued to be rushed throughout the remainder of the night.  My husband had puttanesca and said for the record it was really good.  However, even the house salad was different.  Super sad day for me! I loved this place.",

It lacked any sort of flavor and the chicken was rubbery. Maybe I needed to try something else. It was quite busy.

Lots of tasty garlic bread to sop up the sauce. Would I make the bread crispier? Yes Did I eat it? Yes Would I order it again? Yes  The Mozzarella Cambrese was fine. Cheese was on the edge of grainy....not awesome, but fine.  The Osso Bucco was outstanding. Tender but not overcooked. Delicious and sumptuous.  The crazy alfredo was excellent, although a little stingy with the protein, but still, quite tasty.  Veal Parm was solid.  The surprise of the table was salmon piccata. As dish that would be easy to mess up...they didn't. They married those hard to meld flavors into something special.  While I have no need to return to Vegas this year, if I do...we will return.",

We sat in the \"kitchen area\" which is not a great place to sit due to all the servers constantly going back and forth.   Once seated expect the server to make a concerted effort to get the table to get a salad (which are $11.50 to $17.90). The unaware diner might get the sense that they come with dinner as the servers never really let on that it doesn't and you have to pay for it.   Of the 3 dishes our group got I'd only recommend the Fettuccine Carbonara which is alfredo sauce, ham & prosciutto. If you're on a diet you may want to steer clear though as there is some serious fat in this dish....we took the remainder to go and after being refrigerated the fats all solidified into a hard pasta-brick. Hmmmm.  The Alla Nora is over-rated. For one thing the spaghetti was overcooked so bad that I could never twirl it into a forkful...the spaghettis would simply break so I had all these tiny sections I had to fork up. Plus it says there is eggplant in it but I couldn't find any...? Meh.",

The chairs were touching each other and the silverware was touching the next person. Not only were we touching legs but we couldn't even open our menu without getting in the space of the next person. When we asked the host staff to move us and that fitting that many people at a table was really uncomfortable, she said to us: We always sit large parties here and there is never any problem. She basically made it seem like we were crazy. The server agreed that they were crazy for sitting us all at that table and went and spoke with the manager. They basically said we would have to wait until another large table opened up to move. We ordered a few bottles of wine and waited for a table. It took them 1 HOUR. tables were opening up next to us, they could have put two tables together to accommodate us. It was clear they were irritated that we wouldn't try to eat squished together.   Once we got the new table, we got a new server who never came to the table. We had to flag down other staff to ask for water or whatever we needed.  My food was burnt. The list goes on.....  Terrible experience for a birthday. The old location was amazing but now its like all service has gone out the window. very sad to say.",

While waiting in line, we saw several of parties of 2 who came in after us getting sat before us, but we waited thinking they were taking a long time to make a larger table for us. But NO, we were cramped into a 4ppl table; the same-sized table as those parties of 2. We spoke to the manager and he kindly comped our appetizer and salad.     Anthony, our server was attentive and professional, and he made sure we had a great dinner after all.        (I do not know the name of the manager, but if he is reading this, i would like to say that I'm sorry if we ranted too much and gave you one of the hardest nights. We were very hungry and upset.

New location, warm feeling and great ambiance. Ordered ice tea for drinks and they kept refilling our teas and all without asking. The bread was a bit overwhelming with the garlic but still fresh and good. Ordered a house salad before the main dish and it was just the right portion and delicious. Main course was whole wheat penne pasta with pesto sauce. What I loved about this place was that our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. She even offered to go light on the oil in the pesto sauce which I'm thankful for because it was perfect. The cannoli dessert was so good that I finished it all. The only reason  for the 4 stars was that our waitress was a bit MIA. We only saw her once during our dinner and when she brought dessert she acknowledge that and told us the dessert was on the house. Everyone was friendly from beginning to end  and it's easy to see why the locals come here. The restaurant does get packed. My recommendation is you make a reservation before hand and leave room for dessert. Thank you to our server's for the great service. My recommendation, make a reservation before you go to the restaurant and leave room for dessert. You will thank me later.  Location isn't to far from the Rio and worth visiting. Bon Apetito!",

We got seats at the bar but 20 minutes later a table opened up so we were able to move. We ordered the House salad which was more than enough for the two of us. It was quite tasty with tiny mozzarella cubes, firm tomatoes, lettuce, olives and peppers. Our entree was the Crazy Alfredo which was a great combination of sausage, shrimp, roasted red pepper, and chicken. We had pre-ordered the chocolate cake. If you love lava cakes then this is the dessert to order. We shared all the dishes and were overstuffed. Don't eat too much garlic bread if you want to make it to the end of the meal because you will want to eat everything. We will definitely visit again the next time we are in Vegas. I would give this 4.5 stars....it would have been 5 if the wait isn't always so long.",

Mind you we're at the bar and everyone else was already taken care of. The bartender comes finally and says she \"spaced out.\" We finally order food and it takes half an hour, meanwhile the two other couples that say at the bar 15 mins after us already got their dishes. We only ordered a bowl of spaghetti - nothing too extravagant. The food finally arrives; there's hardly any sauce, the meat is burnt, and the noodles are stale. Long story short - the service was terrible and the simplest dish was horrible. We paid for the $8 glass of wine and went to Olive Garden.",

This is when we found this little gem.   We called ahead and made a reservation and was seated promptly upon arrival. They gave us a seat outside and even though it was 100 degrees that day, they had these little cool fans pointed our way so it didn't feel bad at all. My favorite thing about this restaurant was that it just felt like an Italian restaurant instead of being a flashy place to eat in Vegas. The crowd was a little older and there was a band playing music as we dined.  The servers were attentive and the food arrived promptly. We ordered the fried calamari to start which had a nice crunch to it. My main dish was the Primavera which was good. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dish and portions were big so we all had leftovers to take home. If I'm back in Vegas one day, I would check this place out again.",

I love there food I had chicken Marsala and it was so tender and flavorful. Nora's has a great wine selection and large variety of menu items at a fair price. Save room for the in house made Italian desserts it was so good.",

    "text": "My buddy and I misjudged the walking distance from The Palms to Nora's on a 100+ degree evening. The entire walk over we were hoping for the best and that the food would be worth the trek. Nora's delivered just what we were craving. Garlic bread starter went down quickly and we ordered another basket (the first is on the house and any subsequent basket is on you). We had two amazing and large-portioned entrees: fettuccine carbonara and chicken parmesan (you can add any sauce over the pasta you want - I ordered the meat sauce).  The service was excellent. Friendly, attentive and quick servers supported by bus boys, drink boys and cute hostesses. After gorging ourselves, we decided to Uber back to the casino. Once Nora's moves to their brand new stand-alone location, we hope to be back on our next visit to Vegas!  (Also, eating off the strip is so much nicer. Supporting local restaurants has always been more rewarding and delicious!)",

We were seated at our table for about ten minutes before anyone ever came over to greet us.  No busser came to the table to provide water or take a drink order.  Once we did order our server came back only  once to ask how things were.  The food was not nearly on point as it used to be.  The marinara sauce that came out was luke warm at best.  Very very disappointing since we have loved Noras in the past.  Will not be returning.",

    "text": "Italian food is tough to get wrong, but also tough to get right. Nora's gets it almost right, but I don't find it to be the local legend people make it out to be.  The complimentary (well, uh, the first basket at least, which is pretty miserly!) bread is pretty good - flavorful and crisp, and buttery on top. Just a little burned on the edges too, which helps. The appetizers and entrees, while tasty, just aren't rich and robust enough to be legendary. The pasta has never seemed particularly fresh to me, and the portions are pretty tiny. Still, it's good, hearty Italian food - just a bit generic.  Last time, I was daring and tried the Chicken Mount Etna. Don't repeat my mistake. Its flavor is more Chinese than Italian.  Lastly, a couple of non-food-related critiques:  1. Service can be inattentive at times, but they get pretty insanely busy so it's excusable.  2. Try and avoid the obnoxious band. If I want live music, I'll go to a concert. 2a. It's loud as hell in there, even when there isn't a band.  3. They partake in possibly my most-hated restaurant ritual - having empty wine glasses on the table upon arrival. Prepare for an awkward moment and a subtly disappointed waiter when you don't order wine.  When you're in the mood for no-nonsense Italian, Nora's can certainly hit the spot. I just didn't find that it lives up to its reputation.",

I was craving my favorite Fettuccine Carbonara all week so we decided to come for dinner last night (Friday, June 19) for our anniversary. Unfortunately the food gave me food poisoning. We had to cut our \"date\" short since I had the worst stomach pains. I know for a fact it was my food because I didn't eat most of it and brought it home. Today my husband had my left overs for dinner and now he has food poisoning. I'm not sure if I will be returning due to this recent experience. We also had calamari as an appetizer and that tasted great.",

For Appetizers I've had the Calamari which was deliciously seasoned and served with a tasty blush type of tartar sauce however I asked for a side of marinara that was gladly and promptly brought to me.  The Arancini were tasty and nicely seasoned. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a good amount peas, meat sauce and mozzarella on the inside. The presentation was beautiful with basil leaves on top and served over some marinara (which was way too skimpy of an amount but they'll gladly give you more!) My friend and I had the Eggplant Parmigiana and Veal Parmigiana both of which were delicious. The eggplant was breaded and fried lightly with just enough marinara and melted mozzarella on each slice. The veal was tender and well seasoned as well.  They've also got a nice wine list with  reasonable prices. I also like the way they redecorated the dining room with multicolored ceiling tile and the Trinacria. This place is always busy so I'd suggest a reservation especially if you have a larger party.",

Once you step inside you're greeted with the enticing smell of roasted garlic and fresh baked pizza.   The salads, pasta and dishes are all fantastic, you really can't go wrong.

Me, the hubbs, and his mother all went to grab lunch - and seeing how Moises loves pizza, and him seeing their yelp reviews we decided to try it out. The service at the time was very attentive and classy. Drinks never went dry, they let us know of the bread charges - when some places don't.   The pasta dishes felt home made, pizza and the crust yummy. My boyfriend is from Brooklyn, so he is a bit of a pizza snob, and loved this. We loved the garlic bread, it was toasted good, fresh garlic on top.  Not only did I love the food, moderate prices, but I really loved the atmosphere. It gave the good old Las Vegas vibe, with Frank Sinatra playing in the background. It's a part of Las Vegas, not a lot of appreciate - but I felt it in here, that is love.   I marked down a star because we came in the next day for dinner, and the service wasn't that attentive like it was for lunch the previous day.

    "text": "Being second generation Italian, people ask me where my favorite Italian place in Vegas is, and Nora's is it.   But not the whole menu.  For me Nora's is about one thing, and that thing is the eggplant parmigiana (and the cannolli).  I'll get to the parm in a sec, but definitely start your meal out with one of Nora's family style salads.  We get the house salad, and even the generous portion is polished off easily by a group of four.  The garlic bread is a take it or leave it thing.  I've taken people here who thought it was great, and others thought it was okay.  The garlic ensures that you definitely need a breath mint after just one slice, and if you plan on locking lips with someone later on you may want to pass on it.   I've eaten in Italian restaurants all over the country and they serve the best eggplant parm I've ever had.  Thickly cut with a meaty texture, fried to perfection and topped with a generous portion of mozzarella cheese, then popped in the oven (or salamander) it's to die for.  Maybe they put a little too much cheese on top, but I'm the type of guy that says you really can't put too much cheese on anything.  Also I'd get a side order of meatballs, they're top notch.  If you don't like eggplant I'd go with the baked ziti. It's served a little different, with balls of ricotta covering the top of the ziti.  The pizza is solid, but not NYC style, so if that's what you're used to, just order the eggplant.  They do make a white pizza which is kinda hard to find in Vegas. I would not order the chicken parm or the chicken Marsala, it's not made the way people are accustomed to, and besides, I told you to order the eggplant, so why are you looking at other menu items?  At the end of your meal I deplore you not to leave this joint without ordering cannoli.  They're just like momma made 'em, crisp shells filled with a sweet but not too sweet, creamily delicious ricotta, topped on one side with pistachios and the other chocolate chips.  I've also tried the tiramisu, which is very good, but takes up precious cannoli space in my stomach so I usually don't order it.  For me, going to Nora's and not getting the eggplant is like going to a steakhouse and ordering a side of veggies.  This is my go to place for some just how momma made it eggplant, meatballs and cannoli.",

    "text": "This rating is based primarily on my food server. I have been to Nora's before. Even to the old location. Our waitress, whom according to the receipt, Nina, was very un-warm and  un-welcoming. She did not greet us cheerfully, she did not ask us about appetizers. I had to ask to start with one. Her demeanor was one of discontentment, almost like she \"got stuck\" with our table. Maybe she pre-judged us because we had a 9 month old with us, I don't know. My mom asked for lemon in her water, which she did not get. When she refilled my wife's tea, she only refilled mine about 3/4ths of the way. When the main entree came and she was removing the dishes, my mom said \"oh my fork\" and went to grab it, my wife witnessed her roll her eyes to the other staff member who was helping put the entrees down. Several times I saw her run her forearm across her nose to wipe it as she came from the kitchen. She never asked about desserts. She just had a subtle arrogance in her demeanor, almost as if she were somehow part of the family who owns the restaurant and she can do as she pleases, she kept going and chatting with the staff and sorta every now and then looking towards us. At the end, my mom asked her if she would take a picture of us and her reply was \"can I clean the table first?\" A few seconds later she did try to smooth it over by saying \"oh I like a clean table.\" But her overall attitude was just rude. She wasn't busy running around with other tables to make this request a hassle. Overall food was good, and hostess was good, busser was good, atmosphere and new building and location were good. Just not her. However, my wife told me she did smile and wink at my wife at the end...",

The salad was over dressed the pizza was something you could find at a nearby Domino's but the server was great! She was very nice and accommodating.   The tiramisu is okay too... there was just not anything particularly memorable about this experience.  It's worth a casual visit any day but by no means would I take someone here for their birthday.",

The food is easily the best we had in Vegas, and was really reasonably priced. I had the Alla Nora and will be dreaming about it when I'm back home!  The atmosphere was decent. We were there late on a Friday night, and there was a jazz trio playing. Very cool, but way too loud for the small space. It was difficult to hear my husband over the music.   I will absolutely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. Great food for a great price at a fine family establishment.",

Though the chicken Marsala doesn't come close to my uncles it is one of the many I've tried that comes close.   I used to love getting the zeppolis for dessert as a kid. They are fried pieces of dough with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. If you've never had Zeppolis definitely give them a try. You won't be disappointed.   If you have never ate at Nora's I would give it a try if I were you. Very tasty Classic Italian food!",

Got home and found a small box of pasta with two meatballs.  Luckily I ordered extra garlic bread (1st one free) because I would've still been hungry!

I went to Nora's a few nights ago with a friend who also shares my love for Italian food. We made a reservation for 7:30PM (I highly recommend making a reservation!) and were seated within 5 minutes. We had the calamari fritti and a regular sized house salad with Italian dressing to start. We also received a basket of complimentary garlic bread to nibble on. These starters didn't fill us up which I was happy about because I was waiting for my main entree!   My friend had the chicken parmigiana which had spaghetti, tomato sauce & the chicken was not breaded (like you see in other restaurants). I got to steal a bite and the chicken was tender & juicy! I had the Alla Nora which consisted of spaghetti noodles, eggplant, meat sauce with pesto and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The eggplant seemed too crisp, but all of that put together just works!   The restaurant that night was busy and loud. To me, that felt like home.",

After about 10 minutes we were led to a table.  We saw there were 5 other tables in the section already set and empty.  Our table we were led to didn't have all the silverware, where the others did.    After being seated, we saw a group of three arrive, with an elderly woman who was using a walker.  They were made to sit in the lobby for about a half hour, until the people at the table next to us left, and that table was cleaned off.  That was with the 5 tables still empty.  We ordered, and I ordered the \"Crazy Alfredo\".  It was described to be loaded with jumbo shrimp, chicken and sausage.  It showed up with two shrimp, two pieces of chicken, and some sausage.  It had a tasteless alfredo sauce on it, that was just warm starch.  My wife had Chicken Marsala, which I tried a bite of, and found it to be much too sweet.  Our waitress came by to take our order, and that was the last we saw of her.  Someone else brought out the garlic bread, (which was just ok), and the meals.  She did come to bring us the check and we decided to pay in cash rather than wait for the seasons to pass, and her to return to pick up and deliver a credit card.",

I ordered the pork tenderloin for my meal.  It was packed with flavor and crunch.  I only ate a couple of bites, but I would completely recommend this dish for others.

    "text": "Barely contained chaos would describe the atmosphere at this very loud restaurant which we recently visited on a Saturday night.  Understaffed, crowded and noisy would be another description. The saving grace would be the food which is pretty good.....for Las Vegas....but would be mediocre at best when compared to what you you might find in NY or San Francisco.  We started our meal with complimentary garlic bread -- way too much garlic -- and kind of soggy.  We then tried the Caprese Salad which had very good mozzarella but very pedestrian grocery store tomatoes. We also tried the lemon clams which were in a tasty lemon butter sauce, but about a quarter of the clam shells were broken and to be safe, I did not eat the contents of these particular clams. The kitchen should remove such broken shell clams before serving.   For entrees we tried the Chicken Carciofi, a pretty good dish full of chicken, artichokes and capers on linguine. We also had the Puttanesca which was tasty although full of green olives instead of black olives which I have found to be milder and better suited for this dish. The portions were enormous, a negative in my book.   Service was spotty as it seemed our waiter was a bit overwhelmed covering two tables plus a birthday party table with 14 guests.  The appetizers came out very quickly though, but we were put off when the entrees arrived when we were only halfway through our appetizers and when we were finished with our appetizers, the appetizer plates were not removed from the table.   The wine list is pretty good.   Zagats rates this as the third best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas which may be correct but only serves to prove that Las Vegas is indeed in a barren Italian culinary landscape.",

Better food here than anywhere I've been on the strip. A local friend told me about this place and I'm so glad he did. With so many places to eat in Las Vegas you can get lost but this one is worth checking out. The place is always crowded so you got to expect to wait some but great food is worth it.",

Food came out and drinks came out before our utensils. We had to ask 3 different people until we finally saw our server to let her know about the utensils. We also ordered 2 bottles of wine and the server just dropped them off without opening them. She walked away expecting us to have our own wine opener. Manager excused it as her being new. I guess common sense isn't part of the job application. Came here to celebrate but left very underwhelmed. The old Nora's has way better service than this place. Sucks so bad.",

Very disappointed...I heard nothing but great reviews and when we arrived we not only waited 20 minutes to be seated even though we had a reaervation, but we didn't get our food until 40 minutes after ordering. Reservation at 9 and food arrived around 10:35. We wasted so much time sitting and we were so hungry we filled up on bread and by the time we got our meal our appetite was gone. I was disappointed with my order, for it was not worth the ridiculous wait. I understand if it is busy, but the resteraunt was not packed by no means. I liked the inside but not the service at all. They offered us a free dessert. How about no dessert and you just discount our bill ? So much time wasted. We are not going back.",

It was very crowded, so they must be doing something right... The food was good, but not unbelievably out-of-this-world. The breadsticks were so good (honestly my favorite part of the meal). I had clam linguine which was pretty good but slightly too salty. For dessert we had tiramisu and cannoli and I preferred the tiramisu. My friend really liked how many toppings were on the cannoli.  The issue I had was that the waiter seemed kind of excited for us to hurry and leave. Maybe because the place was so packed. I didn't think he was rude but I did get the sense that we were slightly being rushed.   Anyways, the food was pretty good! All in all I had a good experience.",

    "text": "The food I tasted here was low quality and did not taste freshly made.   After sitting down, the garlic bread was brought out right away. I spit out the first bite because the bread tasted days old and was soggy. I asked the bus boy how the bread was made and he said Nora puts the spread on in the morning and then they bake it. If any type of spread is sitting on bread for hours it will still have that soggy consistency no matter what you do to it. He said he would bring us another batch and it would be crispier. It was crispier, however, it still tasted old and even though there was plenty of seasoning it had minimal flavor. I ordered the alla Nora and my friend ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. My pasta was baked in an oven and came out piping hot. They need to cool this pasta before they bring it out to customers because it's impossible to eat for at least 10 minutes. The first bite I had was awful. The eggplant was soggy and the tomato sauce tasted like it had come from a can. The tomato sauce reminded me of the one time in my childhood when I tried a friends spaghettios. My friends pasta was better than mine and for an Alfredo the sauce was lighter than I had expected. The chicken was okay but it would have been better if it was grilled and the pasta was mostly clumped together. I called over the manager to tell him I could not eat my pasta and about the other issues I was having. He apologized and expressed his embarrassment for the situation at hand. He ended up comping our meal and sending us home with a free dessert which was a nice touch.   Nora's just needs a complete face lift and some level of sophistication.",

And if I have anything less in taste than what I had today, I will feel sorely cheated.  For lunch, the menu is quite extensive.  I settled on the individual Nora's salad. Field greens with roasted green and red peppers in a lovely and light balsamic vinaigrette.  I also ordered the appetizer of Arancini.  These are four crisply fried balls of deliciousness.  Inside is saffron risotto, peas and mozzarella.  The base was a tasty and authentic tomato sauce that was definitely not Ragu-esque.  I wish my stomach had more room because I definitely wanted to try another dish.    I will definitely keep Nora's on my Vegas foodie rotation.",

    "text": "I really don't know where to start as I had heard this place is incredible! I read many Yelp reviews and some were great and a few not so great.  So, here goes.....I made a reservation for two at 5:45 on a Tuesday night.  We were welcomed by the hostesses and sat immediately. Our server asked for a drink order and I had read that the sangria was good but not enough fruit in it. The server asked if I would like to sample it before ordering a glass.  I thought that was top notch customer service.  It was a red sangria so I opted out and ordered a glass of Reisling. I normally don't order wine, but I thought I would treat myself.  The other member of my party (my 17 yr. old grandchild ordered a diet Coke).  Before I continue I would like to state that the server and waiter's assistants were incredible and my grandchild's drink was refilled at least 5 or 6 times.  We were brought complimentary garlic bread and it was delicious.  After we inhaled the first basket, our server asked if we'd like another and we couldn't resist.  We ordered the crazy alfredo that I had read so much about, and the server told me it was the most popular dish on the menu. That item was $22.95 which I consider pricey for pasta regardless if what is in it.  In addition I had always wanted to try bransino (a whole small sea bass) and decided to treat myself as it was pricey for my wallet at $28.95.  We also ordered a small white pizza that had beautiful mounds of ricotta for $13.95. Cutting to the chase.......The bransini was very dry and no flavor even though there was a spring of rosemary and a lemon wedge or two inside. The dish was served with a mound of dressed arugula salad which was the 2nd highlight of our experience.  The crazy alfredo was dry, the sauce was rather brown in color than your every day alfredo that is white.  The pizza was the highlight of the meal and the least expensive item. Our entire bill was $84.22.  We didn't finish the meal and brought home the pizza and pasta. I left a hefty tip for the pristine service.  I am going to make an authentic alfredo sauce to add to the pasta for tonight's dinner side dish.",

I'd order something else next time probably.  My parents ordered the carbonara and a penne dish and both loved them.  I personally didn't like the sangria...something tasted really off to me but again my parents both enjoyed it.  I had the Oreo dessert and they got the pistachio cannoli...both tasted  excellent but my parents found a piece of plastic in the last few bites of their cannoli.  The server ended up taking it off the menu for us.  Kind of a subpar experience overall in my opinion.  I want to like this place and would probably give it one more shot.  Everything would need to go right from the service to the food the next time though for me to make Nora's a repeat place for me.",

My favorite time to go is the weekends when they have this 3 man band play.  They play oldies from Sinatra to some modern music too. My goto dish is the linguine w/clams or the Fruti Di Mari.  Good stuff!  Plus their garlic bread is good too.  Aside from Olive Garden this is the only Authentic Italian place I've eaten at in Las Vegas.  I will try more... Check this place out... you might like it!!!",

    "text": "Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.   My gf and I double dated with another couple here late on Friday night. I was a bit worried to sit down for dinner after 10:30, but my worries were quickly dismissed upon arrival.   There was a band playing some jazz music in the room to the right and we were seated far enough away from the band to where we could talk but still hear the music faintly in the background. I was very happy about this because sometimes loud music blaring in my ears can be a turn off during dinner time. I like conversation, what can I say.   I discovered that upon checking in on Yelp, I received a free glass of wine. AMAZING! Our friends ordered the sangria which they could not stop raving about! I highly suggest ordering this if you love sangria because it is some of the best I have ever had.   We began our meal with an order of Arancini. I've never heard of or seen this on a menu before, but when my girlfriend saw them she went nuts. They looked like meatballs but were fried balls of risotto, cheese, peas, and meat sauce. Incredible! I could have eaten ten of them! Our waiter also brought out a basket of garlic bread and I thought it was excellent.   We opted to share the special for the evening upon our server's recommendation, which was Chicken Mount Etna. This dish was really unique. I have never had anything like it. The chicken was cooked perfectly with some mozzarella cheese and peppers and was served on top of crispy, fried, angel hair pasta (think ramen noodle texture?) with a balsamic sauce/reduction and topped with onion strings. Strange combinations for an Italian restaurant, but REALLY REALLY GOOD. I cannot stress the deliciousness enough. It was a perfect portion for us to share, but I couldn't resist ordering a side of penne a la vodka (I'm a sucker). Their vodka sauce was delicious!   For dessert, we pre-ordered the warm chocolate cake. I'm not a chocolate cake fan, but my gf loved it as did the rest of the table.   Our server was amazing. My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. Even though we were one of the last tables in the restaurant because we started late, I did not feel rushed or get the vibe that they were waiting to go home. Everything was perfect.   I recommend this spot for a date night, dinner with friends, or any time you want some home cooked, reasonably priced, off the strip Italian food.",

Well, that time recently happened, and he was RIGHT! The food was delicious! He had the rigatoni special and I had steak sandwich for lunch. We thought that going there for lunch would be not as busy, but it was pretty full with the locals enjoying their lunches too! I'm looking forward to going back the next time we're in Vegas for sure! Will try their pizza, but I have no doubt it will be good! Clean restaurant too. It's not on the strip, but not everything good is there, remember that!",

It was good but I thought for the price it should come with some pasta or mashed potato, not just the fish and spinach.

    "text": "I was hoping for a better experience at Nora's because it is a popular, independent, family owned place, generally the kind of restaurant I like to support.   There were three of us and we had a reservation for 7:30 PM on a weekday evening. We were quickly seated and given menus. The waiter kept prompting us to order drinks but only one of us wanted a glass of wine. We received a small basket of garlic bread which was OK. It was quite a while before our food order was taken and by the time our food arrived we had been there for 50 minutes. Two of us had the \"Crazy Alfredo.\" The third person had the pasta with broccoli. That dish was so salty as to be inedible and was sent back. It was another 15 minute wait for it to be replaced.  The two of us who had the Crazy Alfredo both thought it was OK but nothing special. Same opinion from the person who had the pasta with broccoli.  Around 8:30 a female vocalist and her male musician accompanist began performing from a small stage at the front of the room. Mostly blues and song titles from the 40s & 50s. That was enjoyable.  Menu prices here were average for a restaurant of this caliber. Drink prices seemed high. A glass of \"house red wine\" was $9.50. Sorry to say, but there was just not much here to draw me back again.",

    "text": "Las Vegas Review Part II of the \"Losing Money, Spending Money and General Hubby Eating Freebies Back At Home Tour\".  Friday night in Vegas, it was my mom's choice for dinner and she is a Vegas local, so of course she didn't want to hit the strip, or have a buffet, or deal with the traffic and valet at the hotels.    Nora's Cuisine is a mid-size local Italian restaurant, that appears to be popular.  They had live entertainment, which I found to be ok, but definitely geared towards an older crowd (and hell I'm older now, and it was still too old for me!)  The portions are large but I found the prices to actually be on the high side.  Let me explain:  Italian food usually is larger portions and usually is on the cheaper side, excluding Northern  Region Italian and some pricier ingredients, think Marscapone Cheese, Veal and Fresh Seafood.  I ordered a fairly basic salad and spaghetti & meatballs, both really standard with basic and cheaper ingredients.    While both dishes were large, the salad was again, basic, could have used more mozzarella and other than a few olives, tomatoes and onion, was overpriced at $7.95.  Highlight of salad was the homemade ranch dressing which was delicious.  The spaghetti & meatballs was again large, but the 2 meatballs were more on the smaller to medium size and you were really left with quite a bit of pasta.  I did not detect any veal in the meatballs, and the seasoning/ingredients was not quite there, as they were not soft and tender and appeared to be missing the requisite amount of cheese.  I found service to be lacking, I had to ask twice for a simple refill of iced tea and I also had to ask for parmesan cheese as a topping for my spaghetti & meatballs.  The waiter seemed stressed (too busy perhaps) but that's not exactly my problem, is it?    Side note:  My mother had made reservations, we were on time, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes.  Overall I would recommend Nora's, but I don't know that I would make it a for sure Italian destination when I'm back in Vegas.",

While I was quick to be seated as I had a reservation, we were greeted about 5-10 minutes after we sat down by our server. She took our drink orders, and we got our drink orders rather fast. Fast forward it take's our server about 20-30 minutes before she came back to take our dinner orders, and even longer to get bread.  I ordered the chicken parm, while my girlfriend ordered the gnocchi. We are fine up to that point no complaints, besides the long wait, we get our dinner and first thing we notice is that my girlfriends entree of gnocchi is literally just the pasta with tomato sauce. They put no cheese on it. I flag down the server to get cheese. She brings us back a parmesan shaker. (What italian place does this?).   The meal ended up being horrible, she couldn't even finish half off her gnocchi. The spaghetti that came with my chicken Parmesan was completely stale, it tasted like it had been sitting there for the last two hours.  All in All we wont be coming back, this is a sorry excuse for an Italian restaurant, and wont be referring others to this place.",

I used to work around the corner from this place and ordered out all the time because they had amazing spaghetti and a great lunch special and after a few years I ended up back here for a lunch meeting. Nothing has changed. The food was just as good as it always had been and the service is also always great.  The one negative for me is the ambiance. It's a very plain looking place and there's not much to it. Once again this is a place I would love to makeover. The food is always key for me and service is next so I still highly recommend this place for classic Italian dishes. Some of my favorite items are the antipasto, chicken Milanese and spaghetti with meatballs.",

There were 5 of us and we ordered a large salad that was enough to serve everyone at the table with seconds.  Ands, it was very good!  I ordered one of their menu's \"Lunch Favorites.\"  It was the penne chicken broccoli pasta with garlic and oil.  It was excellent.  One minus--there wasn't enough garlic taste for me.  One of the others at the table ordered a large pizza with pineapple and mushrooms--the pineapple being a first for me.  It was such a pity when there were three pieces of pizza left over and she couldn't take it home with her.  She was winging back to Canada the next morning.  I made the sacrifice and took one for the team.  I brought the three pieces home, had one for dinner, and have the other two frozen for a lunch treat!  Tip to Yelpers---go out to eat with out of town friends the day before they're flying home and you might get some take out for the rest of the week.  I have been a fan of Nora's for several years and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking for good Italian food with a really good atmosphere and great service!",

The food did indeed live up to its reputation- however the overall experience was highly disappointing due to their 1. losing our reservation; 2. Having cavalier attitudes about their mistake; 3. Lack of urgency to \"make it right\"; and 4. Inattentive service at the table once we were finally seated over an hour later.  Additionally, I had purchased a gift card (which was used to pay for our dinner), and the process to purchase the gift card was archaic.  Overall, Nora's needs to place more attention on customer service- particularly at reception- if it hopes to maintain its customers.",

    "text": "Recently my wife and I, along with some friends, stayed at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino on Flamingo (See my detailed review). My buddy asked a local to recommend a good Italian restaurant. Without hesitation, Nora's was the choice. Since it was only a couple miles west on Flamingo we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed.   Our party of five arrived at 4:30 on a Friday and the place was already busy. However they were able to seat us in about five minutes. Great start. The server, whose name I wish I could remember, was wonderfully friendly. In fact, every one who worked there had a wonderful disposition while hustling to provide great service. We were very impressed.   The dishes ordered by us included two dishes of spaghetti with marinara, one with sliced Italian sausage, Linguini and Clams (clams both in the shell and mixed in with the pasta), Spinach Cannelloni (my choice), and cheese tortellini with marinara. We also ordered a house salad served family style which was wonderful. There is also strips of garlic bread served with dinner.   All the dishes were raved about. The servings were large without being ridiculous. My wife only was able to eat half of the Linguini and Clams, but since our hotel room had a mini-fridge she was able to take it back for a late-night snack. My Spinach Cannelloni has (of course) spinach, fresh pasta, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, covered in a tomato sauce. I was a little nervous about the tomato sauce but I needn't be. It has a wonderful flavor that complemented the stuffed cannelloni. Delicious!  Next trip to Vegas we will be back. Without a doubt one of the best meals we've had in the city in our many years of coming. Prices are also very reasonable for what you get. Great food, great service, great dining experience!",

The next Res wasn't until 9:30 but for a party of 5 was about a 30 min wait right now. So we drove over & was told 30-45 min wait. As soon as you walk in the place smells amazing & you are greeted to an open kitchen right in front of you & the dining room to the left & bar to the right. It only took about 20 for our table to be ready.   We ordered to Yelp recommendations, crazy Alfredo, shrimp scampi dinner, chicken Marsala & eggplant parm. The complimentary garlic bread is delicious & even their plain white bread is tasty (for the baby).  Everything was so good & the portions are huge. We had left overs for each dish. You can easily share one dish between two people. We will definitely be coming back but will know to make reservations.",

    "text": "Finally.  After a good 6 years of knowing about this place, really ever since dining at the old/extinct location on Rampart/Charleston like 20 times, it was about time I came to the original.  As I understand, they've expanded onto the original.  What used to be a pizza kitchen with 3 tables, went left, and went right, and now has 3 distinct rooms with 3 distinct different feels.  When reserving a table, make sure you specify.  The family room (quiet and better for families), the casual (still 3 tables, attached to the kitchen), and the ritzy (connected to the bar, very nice, and hip).  PS.  One little TV in the bar doesn't quite cut it.  (1)  One free Sangria with Yelp check-in with 1 purchased.  A $7.50 value, giddy up.  Could be more fruity and less sharp.  (4.0 stars)  (2)  Pasta alla Nora ($12.50) -- It has everything I wanted.  Pesto, meat sauce, eggplant, and pasta.  I added a meatball for $1.50, and it exactly fixed the spot.  Huge portion.  (4.0 stars)  (3)  The Melrose with Shrimp ($17.50) -- a creamy pesto sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and medium-size shrimp.  A little heavy-handed with the sauce, but better than not enough.  (4.5 stars)   The service was nice, but wavered between unavailable and forgetful.  Overall, this place just makes me happy.  It would totally be my everyday place if I was local.  For out-of-towners, if you are looking for an easy-peasy spot away from the strip, this is your place.",

Food: Get yourself some of the fried risotto balls for an appetizer to go along with the complimentary garlic bread.  My favorite entrees are the Alla Nora and any pasta with the vodka sauce.  My husband likes the linguine with clams.  I know that one of their \"famous\" dishes is the Crazy Alfredo, but I'm here to tell you that you can pass on that dish.  Too much stuff in there and the flavors don't stand out because they're all competing against each other.  Drinks: Original and handcrafted cocktails at the full bar.  Of course they have a substantial wine list also, but I'm a cocktail girl.  Those bartenders know their drinks, and can make a wicked Sazerac.  Service: There are two dining areas and a private room that you can reserve.  The private room does have a fee to reserve it, but you get this amazing appetizer platter that is enough to serve around 12 people.  I've never had a problem with service at this restaurant; they are wonderful (my favorite waiter is Will, a tall and handsome drink of water!).  No other Italian place compares.",

When we arrived, there was a live band playing, there was a dark ambience, and the restaurant was about half-full.   The tables were covered with what appeared to be butcher paper, which I thought was a little odd. When I got my menu, I was surprised by the number of choices. I opted for the special, called the Mt. Etna Pasta, which consisted of pan fried angel hair, chicken breasts, potatoes, peppers, and a balsamic reduction, among other things.   When my dish arrived, it looked like a volcano of some type. I didn't know where to begin. It looked odd to be certain, but I reserved judgment until I had a chance to taste it. I must say that it is one of the tastiest Italian dishes I've had in the last 10 years. I devoured the dish despite its large size, and left a happy camper.  The prices were reasonable. The band was just okay. The butcher paper table was a little bit tacky. The service was good. Overall, I recommend this place to anyone that is not desperately trying to impress a first date. Get to know the person a bit, THEN take him/her here and tell them to get the Mt. Etna.",

Came here not knowing what to expect-- it was busy, small but had that feeling of authenticity, friendly staff, tables covered with butcher paper. Although  I almost felt out of place walking in here.My bf and I came here wearing  jeans, t-shirt and flip flops and everyone else looked so fancy. But we were able to be seated immediately without being given a hard time so I guess dress code wasn't an issue.   Service was quick despite of the traffic. We immediately started off with calamari which was excellent, and also the garlic bread--nicely toasted with some butter and ofcourse garlic. With the help of our server, I got myself a cocktail called the \"berry explosion.\"And it was excellent, not too strong and was berry delicious. For the entree, my bf ordered the \"Crazy Alfredo\"--sausage, chicken, mushrooms, and shrimp. That was actually real good, I say better than what I ordered, which was the Orange Roughy with angel hair pasta. It was a wee underflavor and wow that fish was fishy. Not a big fan of it but yet again there's plenty of food to choose from and there will be a next time.   The place is not that cheap either. 70 bucks including tip for this dinner but it was worth it, minus the fish.. sort of. And we thought it was busy when we got here, but it was mad busy on the way out. They do take reservations and I highly recommend that.",

So I step inside and the first face I see is old baby blue eyes. It's too bad that this and a street name is all we got left of him in Vegas.  The hostess was distracted with takeout orders when I entered and I was left waiting for more than five minutes at the front. After I was seated, I was greeted by the server, who addressed me as \"sir\", which would normally be awkward for me but came off as polite in this instance.  My bread and drink came out relatively quickly. The bread was a garlic toast which was a little on the soggier side and not so garlicky.   I ordered the \"crazy\" Alfredo, which is the standard fettuccine Alfredo with jalapenos, sausage, chicken, and mushrooms. I guess somebody was eating pizza and decided the toppings would be just as well in a pasta. The peppers really did overpower everything else in the dish as it was hard to even taste the Alfredo sauce. The pasta was cooked correctly but the taste was not all that great.  The check took a while to come out so I would say that the service is inconsistent here.  I guess this would be the point where mama would hit me in the back of the head with a spatula for this review.",

    "text": "I have been here on several occasions. I've had some truly excellent dishes. Yesterday, however, was not one of those days.  I ordered the fettucine carbonara, a usually, well-balanced dish. They missed the mark yesterday. Where do I begin? The pasta was not cooked properly, some was al dente and some was close but under done...how do you do that? Perhaps they realized they didn't put enough in the pot and added some a few minutes later...? Who knows. They use ham in the carbonara. It was like they rolled up a bunch, cut it and threw in the. They didn't separate the pieces. There was so much ham I couldn't taste anything else. I spoke to the manager and showed him my plate. He agreed that there was too much ham in the dish. We didn't discuss the other issues. He asked me if I wanted it remade but I didn't. I had to go in search of a manager because I couldn't get the waiter to come to my table. No one asked me if I needed more water. No one came to inquire about my satisfaction with my dish. Had someone done so early on I might have had them remake it. As it was the manager took the pasta off the bill. I would have preferred enjoying my meal. Maybe I'll try again but at the moment I am undecided.",

Most recently, dined in a group of four - we ordered a large salad (Antipasto) and the arancini to share. The large salad easily had two servings per person. Both were super tasty... And we easily could have had just that for dinner - we ended up boxing up all but three bites of our entrees (equally delicious) to eat for lunch the next day. I can vouch for the Crazy Alfredo, gnocci (and vodka sauce), Pasta Puttanesca and Rigatoni Special. Yuuuum.   Our waitress was super friendly and attentive (wish I could remember her name - sorry!) and recommended a great bottle of wine - and made no judgement about the fact that we told her we wanted to stay on the cheap side of the list.  Go, go, go!",

The atmosphere is very authentic.  My wife and I sat in the bar area on a weekend evening.  They had live entertainment.  I felt like we had stepped into a scene of \"The Godfather\"",

    "text": "Once in awhile, I have a craving for Italian food.. and when I do, it has to be GOOD Italian food.. so I come here!   Nora's is a cute little restaurant in a plaza that is just Bleh.. but once you walk in the doors, the smell and the bustling waiters invite you in to their little world. There's always a busy bar with patrons eating and drinking on there, as well as 2 little rooms that are always full of people happily enjoying their food.   I've ordered a couple of different things here but my all time favorite as to be the clam linguine. I have asked the chef to make a \"pink sauce\" each time, which is a combination of white and red sauce, and it's delectable. The flavor is great and the chef is not cheap with his clams! There's a ton in his dish and it's worth every penny.   The breadsticks here are also very very good. It's made with real garlic and really hits the spot. The first basket is on the house! But I always order another basket :)  The white sangria here is also a good choice. A few sips of that always makes my night fun.   I will keep coming back. See you there!",

    "text": "FOOD: Ok  SERVICE: Poor... Very poor.   CLEANLINESS: The appearance and cleanliness is very good.   Beyond the above, this was our \"wish we can hop in a DeLorean and go back in time to avoid this place\" experience. Just a note: it's fairly long, which is why I already put the key things above. So read beyond this if you'd like. If not, I totally understand.   This was our wedding anniversary. At our hotel, an employee recommended this place to us. We do have this one other place we absolutely love, but I'll get into that later.... So, we decided to give Nora's a try.  We made reservations for four.  Upon arrival, we were seated in a timely manner. But this is where things came go a stop....That's exactly how it felt from the moment we were seated.   We waited. Waited. And waited. Finally, someone asked for our drink order. Another stoppage moment. Waited. And waited. A waiter, I think Sebastian or Sebastia, hurriedly comes to our table and repeatedly apologizes for the long delay. Oh yes. This dude was very aware of our wait. He went on how he has to cover the other side of the restaurant. Not a few tables in the same section. But the other side that you cannot see from where we are sitting. Apparently, he's the only Italian speaking waiter and this large party on the other side who spoke Italian, needed attending to.   Okay. Our only thought was \"So, why doesn't management or the owner step in?\" Why don't they be proactive and have someone cover his tables while he attends to something they are unable to do?\"  Makes sense, right? I mean, if he has to step away because he is the only Italian speaking waiter, this will take time away from his other customers. This was not done. And boy did we pay the price.   Here's the deal... we waited ONE FULL HOUR till our food arrived at the table. Yes, you read that right... one hour. I even told him \"do you realize your repeated 'sorry, but you have to do something else' had us waiting for one hour?\"  And I kid you not, this was his answer... \"I'm so sorry.\" I don't know what was more sorry... choosing Nora's or this guy's attitude to put on a disappearing act followed by the only line in his one-man show: \"I'm sorry.\"  I mean, it was that bad!    In Los Angeles the stereotypical thing is that many waiters are  \"actors\". So I'm guessing being in Vegas, Sebastia, has a desire to be a magician and one day headline his own show on the Strip. I mean, he has certainly mastered the art of illusion with his service. David Copperfield, if you're looking for a protege, this is your guy. I can vouch for his disappearing act.   In the end... Families. Couples. Out-of-towners. Newlyweds. Honeymooners.... we would not recommend this to anyone at all. This was a horrible experience for us. It didn't help that the food was just ok, too. But that service... by far the longest wait we have ever experienced. And the lack of having someone, whether it's management or anyone of authority to recognize this and be more proactive about the situation... talk about being complacent.  The respect for the paying customer: Zero.   So back to that one place we absolutely love.... There is a silver lining to this whole thing. You see, no matter how crazy or unprofessional these moments might seem at times, always know this: You have the ultimate decision to do whatever it is you want to do. So rather than making this wedding anniversary dinner at Nora's spoil our Vegas trip, the next evening, we decided to return to the place we love... PIERO'S. The host has always been incredibly professional. The servers: A whole different level of service, and I'm talking amazing service . If you were to peak behind you at times, you would notice another staff standing by to make sure you were attended to. You know how you sorta look around, and they catch this, then someone says, \"Yes, is there anything I can get for you?\"  And best part of Piero's... being this was our anniversary all over again - the host sat us at the booth they used in the movie \"CASINO\".  The scene where Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone sitting at their booth. Although the movie used a different name, this was the restaurant, Piero's.   Good luck to all. It is your money. It is your valuable time; especially to those from out of town, time is very short and you want to make the best of it.",

It's intimate, yet fun to bring a small group of friends.  Reservations are recommended, because they are quite popular with the locals.    The calamari is a great starter (light in batter, crispy, yet not oily).  The Frutti di Mare with the spicy marinara is yummy if you like a whole lotta seafood.  All portions are big, so you can share between two people.   But if you like something light in taste and creamy and not too meaty... I recommend the Melrose Shrimp.  Creamy basil pesto, zucchini & sun-dried tomatoes, and linguini-- garnished with 3-4 giant succulent seasoned shrimps.  There are pine nuts added which gives it a nice crunch, but you can ask them to hold off on that if you're allergic or it's not your thing.  I really enjoyed their live band which played a lot of vocal jazz (New Orleans kinda tunes).  It was great vibe.  My friends and I had so much fun--we'll definitely be back!",

The service was very good and the pacing of the courses was right on track.  Arancini and calamari were both cooked perfectly and were delicious. Nora salad was not my favorite, but I'm not a big roasted pepper fan. Garlic bread was delicious. They also have a full bar with plenty of specialty drinks.  I had the gnocchi in vodka sauce which was tasty but I wish the gnocchi's were a little more firm. Other dishes ordered at the table were eggplant parmesan, angel hair with meatballs and linguine with clam sauce. Everyone enjoyed their selections and the portions were just right.  We topped it all off with chocolate chip & pistachio cannoli for desert and cappuccino.  Overall, we had a very nice experience at Nora's. It's a little bit pricey, but not bad considering what you would probably pay for lesser quality food at any of the Italian chains. I will definitely be back and would like to try their pizza.",

    "text": "DL and I were promised a free breakfast and a $100 Visa gift card just for \"touring\" some new Time Share units and giving our \"opinion\".  An offer we couldn't refuse.  After 1 1/2 hrs. of unrelenting, hard sell, we left the sales office feeling even $200 wouldn't have been compensation enough.  The only good thing to come of the grilled-over-the-coals experience was the salesman's recommendation of Nora's.  We decided to take the Visa card and go there for dinner.  All I can is, \"all's well that ends well\", and it all ended very well, indeed.  The salesman has redeemed himself with  us!     We're barflies and love to eat and drink at the bar.  It's a great place to sit if you don't want to be rushed or have your dinner tete a tete constantly disturbed by well-meaning waitstaff.  Love Nora's white and gray-streaked, beveled marble bar.  Elegant.  You could slice cheese on it!  I like my Manhattan's chilled to almost frozen and I told our friendly bartender to \"shake the hell out of it.\"  He shook it all up like Elvis and poured it into a thickly frosted martini glass.  Peeling the lemon was a show in itself.    Our first order was a tower of veggies--zucc., eggplant, Belgian endive, all topped with two fat slices of red bell pepper and arriving perfectly blistered from its bake in the wood burning oven.  You could taste the mellow woodiness in every bite.  Each leaf and ingredient in the house salad was lightly coated with the most perfectly balanced and seasoned House made Italian dressing.  I've been trying for decades to make a dressing like that at home, and still haven't succeeded.  We finished the entire generous portion between the two of us--a first for salads for us.  We usually get bored halfway through.     The pizza was made with all imported cold cuts.  Flavor burst from all points on the compass with every bite.  It's the kind you can fold and eat neatly.  The crust, including the bottom, was browned and lightly charred and I saved a few crusts from the rim to have with my coffee this morning. The surrounding crust was surprisingly light to the touch even though it had the appearance of a dense peasant bread.  You won't break your teeth on it.  Nowadays, pizza has come to mean \"salty, oily, and characterless\", as in almost all chain foods.  Or overly precious and pristine, (think \"white\" pizza) as in many high-end bistros.  If you're bored with all that--you are in for a surprise.     We are relatively newcomers to Malbec and don't count ourselves among the experts.  We got the least expensive bottle and were well pleased.  It complemented and held its own against this hearty fare.      An interesting aside:  How do all the girls gathered around the reservation podium stay so anorexically thin with all those aromas and glorious visuals swirling around all night?  Inquiring minds want to know.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this restaurant since it opened. There is no exaggeration on that. The old location used to be a tiny kitchen with only about 4 tables to eat at. They expanded twice and now have moved to a completely new location. I have dined in all the locations and have never been disappointed   Nora's is the best Italian food I have ever had. I have tried countless Italian restaurants and nothing compares. I used to complain that other Italian food was gross and actually wouldn't even eat any other Italian food for a while. Not only is it the best in Vegas, but it also holds as the best over many other restaurants in other cities.   Spaghetti and meatballs are a classic but the best I've ever had. Penne ala vodka is amazing. Penne with broccoli sauce and chicken (not on the menu but they always make it for me) is so good. Really I'm not even going to continue because everything on the menu is divine.   The Mauro family is amazing. They've always taken care of my family and I, and we are so grateful for that. Not only do they put out the best Italian food in Vegas, but even in their homes. Their rich Italian culture has been brought out in their loving natures and food-filled parties.   Truly the best Italian restaurant (and one of the best restaurants in general) in Vegas, backed up by one of the best families!!!",

I tried one of the cocktails - it was on the stronger side, so I admit I didn't finish it - but the red wine I had two glasses of (by suggestion of a friend) was fantastic.  The food was also really good!  I had the eggplant parmesan (and much to my lament, I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it) - delicious!!  This is one of the few places in town that features jazz musicians on a regular basis, so if you like that vibe, this is the place for you!",

We had a problem with a pizza which was cold and tasteless, and the manager never acknowledged our party.  Professional he was not!  Our salads had no taste, and the waiter was not very proficient.  Sorry to complain, but we never had these issues at the old Nora's, and this was our third time at the new Nora's all of which were not a very good dining experience. We won't be coming back and like the old saying, if it's not broke don't fix it,the old normal Nora's wasn't broke.The waiter presented our order to the manager and he never acknowledged our complaint,if he doesn't show concern to customer service how is the staff.",

Our drinks were brought right away and our sever was very informative and helpful about answering questions had we needed to ask any about the menu. I decided on lasagna and I convinced my boyfriend to try the crazy Alfredo because everyone raves it was crazy good. Also because it has three different type of meat in it. We were brought some garlic bread but it had a weird taste to it. The garlic part tastes good but the bread had a off putting inedible taste I did not stand to eat. Our food took a while in my opinion but they were making it to order (I believe?) so I didn't really mind. We were brought our pastas and after being so excited I was quickly let down yet again. My lasagna had an overwhelming taste of basil. The crazy Alfredo was not to my liking. I thought I would like it but prefer a classic Alfredo instead. My boyfriend finished the entire plate of Alfredo which means he loves it and doesn't even like Italian food unless it's seafood. The meatballs I ordered in addition to my lasagna because I was unsure if it came with meat because the menu didn't state of it did or not, we're tender and flavorful and I did enjoy the one that I ate. I would give this place another chance and order something else. I just wasn't impressed with what we ordered but the service was great and the fact he ate the entire bowl says a lot. I'll be back with an updated review.",

It's in a crappy little strip mall kind of tucked away where you wouldn't see it unless you were actively looking for it.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The place was packed, the hostesses/waiters were nice, there was a small jazz band playing, we were seated promptly (we had a reservation - HIGHLY recommend booking one) & the food/drinks...oh god it was all SO great.  Here's a rundown of the food we ordered:  Appetizers:  - Garlic Bread (1st basket on the house - it's so good, you'll want to pay for another basket but don't be tempted to fill up on bread!)   - Arancini (so good!)  Dinner:  - Alla Nora (This was my order & it was SO good)  - Pork Tenderloin alla Siciliana  (My friend's dish - it was excellent)  - Chicken Parmigiana (The birthday girl's dish - also very good)  Desserts:   - Oreo Cookie Tartufo (This was good but VERY sweet)  - Salted Caramel Panna Cotta (**THIS WAS MY FAVORITE***)  - Tiramisu (Good! I like a little more cookie to cream ratio but very good)  I was so impressed by everything about this place that I'm taking my honey there tomorrow night for an early valentine's day dinner.  It was the first place I thought of when I was asked if I wanted to go eat somewhere...make sure to check it out if you're in the area & want some delicious Italian food!",

The second most important thing I can tell you is MAKE A RESERVATION! I was very lucky that I have a friend that lives in Las Vegas and was able to recommend Nora's as well as warn me to make a reservation. When we walked in we were sat immediately thought there were a bunch of other families standing there waiting for tables I assume were just walk-ins. We had the mozzarella sticks as a app and they were pretty good. For dinner I had the chicken Parmesan (very good) and my husband had a chicken dish with pesto that he said was absolutely phenomenal! Unfortunately, we were not able to eat it all because the portions were substantial and we were also unable to doggy bag it because we were from out of town. I wish we had Nora's here! If I find myself in Vegas again I will most certainly come back here!",

The ONLY problem about this place is the wait time. So call ahead, make a reservation and have some courtesy to show up on time to enjoy one of the best meals you're going to have in your life. If there is a wait, hang out at the bar (a friend of mine, Angela, works there and is super awesome) until your table is ready.   Once you get your bite into ANY of their food, you'll realize that the wait was worth it. Definitely try the Veal Parmigiana with Meat Sauce! The portion was huge! So it's probably better to hit up this place with a lot of your friends and family style it so you can have a dose of everyone's plate. Second, Alla Nora. Third, try a pizza (you'll be surprised).   I'm not going to go in depth about this place because everything on the menu is honestly amazing, it just depends on what you might be craving that day. Service, impeccable. Ambiance, comfortable. Overall experience, WOW. Stop by and get a meal of a lifetime. You won't be disappointed.",

It's filled with business men and brunching women so me and my tattooed friend felt a little out of place but that didn't stop us. We had a glass of moscato each, the steak bruschetta (SO AMAZING) and we split a pasta. Our bill came to around $60.   Our server was a little strange. We asked to change the sauce on our pasta to a vodka sauce and he kind of just said \"well I like it the way it is but I guess whatever you want\". We thought that was weird because we're both servers and we would never say something like that it comes off judgmental and what's it to you?! Then we asked him to split the pasta in two plates if possible and he made us feel we were asking too much. We said if it's too late no worries but if not it would be easier. He comes back and says \"well the kitchen yelled at me but here you go\". Again as servers WE WOULD NEVER SAY THAT. Why would you try to make the guest feel bad especially at a higher end spot like this where you're going to have pickier eaters. Maybe he was having an off day. Me and my friend ended up laughing about it but it was uncomfortable.   Overall the food is worth the shitty (hopefully one time) service. Maybe it was because he didn't think we would tip since we didn't appear like his usual clientele. Never judge!",

It was our first time, we often drive pass this place and we arent too big on italian cuisine we usually stick to what we have already had. But i think this place will be oue new fave when wanting something different! They had everything i love! Calamri.... pasta..... steak.... and the garlic bread omg dont get me started. Delicious!! The apps were delicious fairly large, we got calamari and steak and arugula salad. We then got the tomato mozzarella caprese which i loved! Then we moved on to dinner, and i got the ribeye (of course).  The only thing that i wasnt fond of was that i ordered my steak medium rare, and came out medium. But not a big deal and i still enjoyed! My man ordered the krazy alfredo which had like, a bit of everything! Chicken, shrimp, sausage, and some veggies. It was so good! We had a great time and of course we couldn't leave without getting dessert. So we got the bread pudding. Im not a fan of it but my man loved it. We would definitely go back!! Thanks Michelle!!",

The great reviews got us here, there was only three of us.   We ordered  Italian wings, without parsley  Fettuccini Alfredo w/ chicken  The fries with Parmesan (forgot the name) And angel pasta with oils and Garlic  The portion sizes are great, and big! The only thing we did not really enjoy where the Italian wings, maybe it was the oil they were fried in, or just didn't hit our tastebuds right.  The pastas, and fries were absolutely amazing! We couldn't stop talking about them. Everything other then the wings were very enjoyable. However we only seen our waitress 4 times, to take our drink order, our food order, bring the food & bring the check. When we asked for stuff she would say oh she forgot.  I would recommend this for the great quality of food, but mild service.",

The menu doesnt have pages and pages of items to choose from, which makes it an easier choice. The cocktails....were phenomenal. They used fresh ingredients including, herbs and more. I ordered the magical mist ( I think that was its name) and the strawberry daze. It was everything I wanted in a cocktail, not just a booze with a splash of juice one people try to pass off. The food.... top notch. Hubby and I shared a house salad, arancini and the spinach cannelloni. It was the best food, so flavorful and light but filling. The garlic bread was delicious also! Now, the service... out of this world. We got to have Don for the night and he was welcoming and helpful and so nice! He never left us waiting for stuff and yet didnt make us feel like he was over watching us. He was fun and seemed to really love what he does. The others were awesome too always clearing our table and smiling. Some restaurants, the servers are no where to be found and are unhappy. Since we left Nora's, we havent stopped recommending it. We have decided this is for sure our once a month spot.",

My son chose the homemade chicken tenders-he really enjoyed it.  I had a Caesar salad to start that I have to say wasn't very tasty:/.  Very mild flavor.  My crazy Alfredo pasta dish was TDF!

I suggest making reservations as they get quite busy especially on the weekends. They start you off with a basket of garlic bread, so delicious!  When I was there last I had the Osso Bucco.  It was probably the best I have had in years.  It was tender and just plain phenomenal!  Had to pass on dessert, ate too much of the main course!  Definitely a place be a regular!",

The Crazy Alfredo is easily the best pasta dish I have ever had, and that's saying a lot. The garlic bread and Ceasar Salad are delicious as well. I haven't tried anything else but I can guarantee that you can't go wrong. Service was great and the atmosphere was relaxed and would be a great place for a quiet romantic dinner. Also, a nice getaway from the craziness of the strip. Will be making this a regular spot of mind whenever in town from now on!",

This new location is beautiful, like I can imagine hosting a special event here. Believe the hype - the garlic bread is the bomb! We also got truffle fries and calamari for appetizers and calamari was great but the truffle fries could have used a little more truffle.   For our main course we got the alla Nora, Carbonara, chicken parmigiana, and crazy Alfredo. All were sooo delicious and very generous portions - all but one of us had to take our dishes home. Our server was so nice and professional and we never had our water glasses empty throughout our meal. They have a very nice bar and a good selection of draanks that I plan on trying next time! I really want to come back soon to try their pizzas it looks great.",

    "text": "I am truly baffled by the high reviews & long wait times for this establishment. I see the parking lot regularly full, and it has been recommended to me from multiple people.  I decided to try it with a friend one night for dinner.  For the price (Roughly $40/ for a soft drink, a shared appetizer [caprese salad], a meatless entree [spaghetti w/ marinara], and a desert [some kind of Oreo concoction]), I expected a tasty Italian meal with *at bare mimimum* the appeal of one from Olive Garden. I was disappointed by this expectation.  For reference, I'm from NJ, and am pretty descerning when it comes to Italian food. With a high percentage of Sicilian immigrants, the region I was raised in has some of the best Italian-American cuisine in the country. Every place I've lived since, it's been a struggle to find really great Italian food that didn't come with a hefty price tag... That being said, it is such a nostalgic comfort food for me that I can eat lower quality/priced versions pretty happily.  At about $40 per person, I would consider this a mid-range meal. So, as I stated earlier, I expect *bare minimum* the quality of food & satisfaction level of eating at an Olive Garden as my gauge... Not an incredibly high mountain to climb.   On a positive note, their atmosphere is lively & fun, and the service was fine (hence two stars instead of one). However, it fails to matter, since I find the food inedible.   The caprese salad was bland & forgetful at best. The marinara (a staple of many Scicilian dishes) was overly sweet & had a similar quality to the sauce found in a can of Chef Boyardee. The spaghetti was very think & over cooked. The oreo dessert was waxy & unappealing. Even my friend's lemonade was off. I've eaten frozen microwave meals that tasted better.   After working in the restaurant industry for decades, I have quite an opinion on food quality & dining (you probably couldn't tell, b/c I tend to mince words). This may be a heritage Italian restaurant in the Vegas scene, but there are so many better ones at this price point, it's absurd. I won't add insult to injury in this review & name places that are much better, but I've been happier eating mediocre baked ziti from the pizza joint down the street than the food I shelled out $40 at Nora's.   If you grew up eating Prego & canned pasta as a kid, I can possibly fathom why you would think this represented good Italian-American cuisine, but I heartily disagree. If you're as descerning about it as I am, and like NJ/NY joints you probably won't enjoy this.",

Also, the smell, everything smells and looks so yummy!  For starters, my coworkers and I shared the fried calamari. I order the frutti de mar in the white sauce and ate at least half a loaf of their garlic bread, it was so garlicky and buttery and oh so yummy! I honestly don't know how I manage to eat so much pasta after all that bread but my pasta was too good to pass up. If I could use one word to describe the food here, I would say its comforting. The food here is totally made with love.  Overall, the hype is real for this place. Check it out if you ever want to eat where the locals eat and not spend $50 on pasta in Vegas.",

I had high hopes for the crazy Alfredo, but ended up finding it to be good, and nothing exceptional. Their wild boar spaghetti was definitely mind-blowing and I'd absolutely get that again if I were to go back.  Service is great, and definitely a nice date spot with your hunny.",

We ordered the calamari to start off with because we love love love calamari. And these were delicious!   As for our entrees we like to share so we got the Chicken Milanese and Gnocci with vodka sauce to share. The chicken Milanese was huge but I loved that it came with an Arugula salad. I enjoy getting some greens with my meal. The gnocchi was fabulous as well. The portions are pretty big so we got to take some food home for left overs. I forgot to mention they give complimentary garlic bread. I usually try and avoid bread but these were too good to pass up. So garlicy!   Lastly we ended our meal with a cappuccino and tiramisu... the cappuccino was on point but the tiarmisu wasn't my favorite. The lady fingers needed to be soaked in espresso more or something. Our server was so sweet and gave us a complimentary mini Cannoli to try for next time. And boy that was good!   Service was fantastic and the decor is very cute!   I would highly recommend if you love Italian food!",

    "text": "Don't skip on the garlic bread!  Nora's Italian Cuisine portrays a high-end style dining for Italian food. The restaurant is very clean and seems fairly new. It was my first time dining here, and based on other Yelp reviews, I was really looking forward to it.   Let me start off with our food - the complimentary garlic bread is delicious! Buttered, seasoned, and toasted to perfection. The Rib-eye sandwich was just okay. The meat was overcooked to well done after we had asked for a medium steak. We also upgraded to truffle fries - great choice for someone who loves truffle as I do. The Crazy Alfredo was good - not over the top great - but good. I wish it came garnished with freshly grated parmesan instead of powdered. The tiramisu had a lot of potential and I really wanted to love it. The flavor was there but the cake layers were extremely dry. If the cake layers were moist; it could easily be one of my favorites.  Our waiter was a nice young man - but I have a slight feeling he may have been new. He came to the table twice to ask me to repeat my order. Our food took over 45 minutes to get to the table, which may explain the overcooked steak, but hey...what can you do? I was also left with an empty water cup for almost 15 minutes. Having nothing to drink is my ultimate dining pet peeve.   I am glad I got to try Nora's Italian Cuisine but something tells me I do not need to come back.",

I had heard of this place serval times in my many visits to the area but never got a chance to get there until April.   It did not disappoint.  We started with the Caprese. Generous portion great tomatoes. Sometimes Tomatoes can be pretty flavorless but these we fresh, crisp and delicious!   I ordered the chicken pesto pasta. I'm pretty picky when it comes to pesto and Nora's was top notch! After the appetizer I just couldn't finish the dish. Not sure I could have anyway.   My friend had the chicken Alfredo and she felt the same. Absolutely wonder tasting dish but just couldn't finish it.   The portions really could be shared. The prices are really good for what you get.  We were both sad we had no way to store and reheat for another day.    This will be a must on all future visits! Next time we are coming hungry!",

The best way to express how much we loved Nora's is that we cancelled or next night's reservation at a celebrity chef restaurant and came back to Nora's... and I had the exact same dish (gnocchi in red sauce with mushrooms and a whole sausage).  This dish was not on the menu, but our server Shelby assured us that they could do exactly what I wanted and they nailed it!  The Fettuccini was a perfect al dante with the Alfredo light and flavorful.  On day two, my wife went for the pizza and it was fantastic. The building is modern, inviting, and very clean. Our only complaint is that it is a bit loud.  Not crazy loud but it made our conversation peppered with \"what did you say.\" The Bocce Ball court just off the patio is a nice touch.  Nora's will be part of any Vegas trip we take.",

I apologize I do not know the name of our server but he had a shaved head and could not be any nicer and attentive to our memorable dinner. We had a reservation and we receded immediately. The hostess greeted us and made us feel quite welcomed.  Water, bread and wine service was on point.  We started with the octopus appetizer, it was really good however it was not the best I've ever had so I probably would not order this again.  Our salad we chose was Noras salad which was quite delicious the lettuce was extremely fresh and all the vegetables had full flavor.  The highlight of the meal was the pizza. We ordered the one with everything on it well done, it was crispy full of cheese and extremely satisfying.  For dinner my nephew had the egg plant Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and my brother had the linguine with clams. They both enjoyed their meals.  For dinner I had the veal chop Milanese. That preparation is not on the menu but I ordered it and they said no problem. I had it with a side of spaghetti with pink sauce. The pink sauce is over the top it's loaded with fresh garlic and chopped tomatoes. The chop was tender however it was the second to the veal chop I had at Antonello in Santa Ana, CA.  We were honestly just too full for dessert. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a business meeting. I really enjoyed it and I would  come back.",

There's also a lot of restaurant chains in Vegas too, so I like to root for local restaurants. Let's start off with the bread that they serve. When you start off with delicious garlic bread, the only thing you can do is look forward to the rest of the meal!  Our table of 7 decided to make it family style. First off comes the Al Prosciutto pizza. Delicious! A right amount of lemon, a good amount of prosciutto on the pizza, excellent start! Afterwards, our pastas came in. We ordered the alla Nora, spinach cannelloni, and the Melrose.  I love how they put quality over quantity, every bite was worth it. I loved all of the dishes, especially the crispyness of the eggplant on the alla Nora.  Ending off the night with the warm chocolate cake. It's a different take of your traditional chocolate cake, but man, do I love a dessert that is not too sweet (no sarcasm). The service was amazing too! They know what's good, and they kept our water glasses filled throughout the whole meal. Considering on being a regular here.",

We ordered a salad that was wilted and drenched in bottled dressing, pasta puttanesca (which we figured no one could screw up - but lo and behold, they destroyed it), and a veal dish.  We had to send the veal back because it was so tough and chewy, they very graciously took it back to the kitchen, but sent a new one to us that was just as terrible.  We didn't eat hardly anything and then left without even taking the food home as it was that bad.  We couldn't figure out why anyone would recommend it.  I do have to say the service was very good, but that's the only redeeming thing we found about it.",

Asked for bottled still water, they brought ice water. We order cheese sticks, spinach salad and 2 entrees. They coursed everything out, cheese came first, a while later, the salad. They were ok, nothing special. As we were finishing our salad, we noticed the room got empty.  Then immediately the entrees came out. From this moment on, the waitress started to rush us. She never checked on us on the cheese or salad courses, then she appears abruptly as we were eating our entrees and asked 'how was everything. Should I wrap these up?' Well, we were eating still, so we said no. Barely five minutes after, she came back and asked ' all set? Should I wrap these up'? My friend let her wrap his entree, as I was still eating. When she returned with his food to go, she picked my plate and asked if  she could wrap it up. I let her do it. I was upset by this time already. My friend asked about the chocolate cake, she said takes '25 to 30 minutes.. I have a cheesecake..' We said no , just the check. They probably would have thrown us out if we had ordered the chocolate cake.. Mind you that we left 9:55, so technically, they were still open. I ate there before and loved it. This time, the garlic bread was the only great item. My pasta was flavorless, my friend entree has so much cheese, it was all we tasted. Cocktails were ok, nothing special. Won't come back.",

DE-LICIOUS! then the ceasar salad came out, great amount of dressing! not too much, not too little!  linguine and clams, shrimp scampi over linguine, crazy alfredo and pepperoni pizza were to follow... we were all very happy with our selections! the clams were small, yet plentiful. the pizza tasted very fresh and oozed with cheese!  we are all definitely big fans and coming back to nora's when we have that italian food craving! i highly recommend this place for good italian food at a reasonable price!!!

My bf got the veal (wah I tell him veal is not pc but he won't listen) and I ordered us calamari to start and Anthony recommended the alla nora to me over lasagna.  We were started with garlic bread which was good though it was covered in butter... straight to my ass. j Straight to my ass!  Second and third pieces... no control whatsoever.  The calamari was also amazing!  Perfect amount of crispy texture and the sauce they serve it with I had to ask for a second ramekin- I wanted to drink it.  I debated taking the ramekin into the bathroom so I could lick all the marinara out of it but thought if anyone saw me take a ramekin into the bathroom they'd think I was a weirdo.  Ok trying to maintain some class I stopped eating the calarmari.  I'm a little person so I was already full at this point.  I took a few bites of my dinner when it came but was still full.  There was a piece of crisp basil on top of the alla nora that I was in love with.  Next time I go to Nora's I'll ask for extra basil leaves like this!!!  Obsessed.  Alla Nora had a parmesean-basil type of grantinee over eggplant, meatball and spaghetti.  I loved it.  I tried some of my bf's side of plain spaghetti which was also very good.  I mean it's weird bc something so basic as spaghetti I don't generally find good but this was.  I did not try my bf's veal but he was very very happy with it.  He is straight-up Italian so he just loves Italian food.  We eat at Mezze near our home a lot and we decided it's a close call which is better but Nora's wins.  I ordered a cannoli to go but wished the chocolate cake had been offered at the start because it takes 20 minutes to make and I didn't read that on the menu.  It was the only chocolate dessert.  The cannoli has chocolate chips on half of it so I guess there is that.  The other half has pistachio bits on the cannoli btw.  I saw a lot of coffee drinks going out and I was dying for one but knew I wouldn't sleep if I got one at that time of night.  We both can't wait to take his parents there!",

I was there on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  I was in town on business, so decided to eat at the bar.  Met a lot of nice local people who had been going there for years.  The bartender was friendly and I sampled a couple of different wines from their excellent list.  There were many good choices on the menu but I settled on the pasta Alla Nora, which was excellent.  I would have tried the meatballs but they make theirs with beef and pork and I prefer the beef and veal recipe.  The salad was excellent and they accommodated me with a side of broccoli.  I can't wait to go back to try the pizza, which I understand is excellent.   Nora's has a great family restaurant atmosphere, the staff is pleasant and the decor is comfortable.  I will be back!",

You have to sit in the back at the bar for the best experience. The bartenders are awesome and remembered me every time I came in. The staff that tended to the front room was OK but not the same atmosphere as you get at the bar. The live music nights were always good....another reason to sit in the back at the bar. Great local spot away from the awful strip. Good date night place!",

    "text": "How did this place get a 4 star rating? The food is mediocre at best. The tomato sauce is lame. The eggplant parm had a bitter after taste from the skin that was left on. It was smothered in poor quality cheese that stuck together and binded itself to the food in a very unappetizing manner. The spaghetti it came with was nothing special. The house salad I could have made better at home and the dressing was not memorable. The garlic bread was overcooked as was the pizza ordered by someone else at my table. The crust was burnt and they still served it?! What the heck? Did not even want to try the dessert. Came on a recommendation and left knowing I would never rely on the person who had recommended it for restaurant selection in the future. Wasted my last meal in Vegas here! Darn.",

    "text": "By reading the other reviews , I am guessing I went there on a bad night. I see lots of people complimenting their marinara sauce, so it can't be that bad.. but the one I was served was either the end of the batch of they ran out and had to use some baught in the store. Their pasta were very bland, nothing out of the ordinary, store baught pasta are just as good. The worst part, to me , was their garlic bread. i refuse to believe that what i was served is what they normally serve. I look, and tasted, like frozen garlic bread from the store, only with more garlic and more cheese added. I had a garlic taste lasting for days after that one.. Like I said , after reading the other reviews, something must have been wrong when I was there , was the chef off ? maybe they didn't receive some deliveries ? Maybe they had tons of cooks calling sick ?  I am not sure , but I will have to come back , for sure it won't be as bad..",

    "text": "Overall:  Fantastic food for the price, a great find off the strip. From what I've heard, this is where Vegas chefs to go eat :)   Ambiance/Location:  Strip mall, but worth the drive off the strip. When you walk in you see chefs making pizzas which sets a nice tone. We sat in the room with the bar and were able to see the end of game 4 of the NBA finals :) Typical dim lighting of an Italian restaurant.   Food:  Fantastic! Per our waiter's recommendation, here is what we ordered:  - garlic bread (one basket complimentary) - fresh soft bread, tasty, crispy  - House salad - the regular portion was split between 4 people, but if you're big on salad you might want to get your own. A nice blend of lettuce, mozzarella, olives, pepperocinis, tomatoes with a oil and vinegar dressing.  - Alla Nora (with angel hair pasta) - hearty red sauce not too tart or overwhelmingly tasting of tomatoes. The eggplant was breaded and fried adding a crispy texture. The ground beef did not overwhelm either. My favorite of the dishes we had.  - Mt. Etna - chicken with multiple layers of tomatoes, fried onion strings, on a bed of red potatoes in balsamic reduction -- chicken was a bit dry, but good flavors  - Chicken Carfucio - the flavors of the capers and artichokes rule this dish which is overall pretty light and allows the fresh tomatoes to balance the dish. This dish is more about the separate ingredients merging than about the sauce (which is mainly oil and garlic)  - Crazy Alfredo - rich and creamy with multiple fun additions including jalapenos! My mom's favorite, and it was indeed a dish to be ordered again.  - warm chocolate cake - you need to preorder this (when you order dinner) and we got 2 for 4 people, which was perfect. I've had others which were creamier and had a more molten center, but this one was unique. the cake was a bit more coarse but very flavorful, and it was topped with crushed pistachios which added a salty crunch, and surrounded but a white cream sauce. I'm used to eating this ala mode, and I think ice cream would also have paired well with this.   Wine list: extensive both by the glass and bottle.   Service:  Friendly waiters and busboys, we had to ask once to get our water refilled though.   Price:  Entrees $12-20, Dessert $4.50-6.50, Wines from $7.50/glass",

We had the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and the meatballs are excellent!  Full of flavor, moist.  The Antipasto Salad is super fresh, crisp romaine lettuce, great deli meats.  Sadly The Chocolate Cake was a bit disappointing for us.  I think it had like nutts and and lemony sauce, it just wasnt quite our cup of tea.  But their Canoli's, OMG those where some of the best i've ever had, very very good!  We visit Vegas often and so far we've been back twice( in 2 months) .  You just cant beat their prices and great food.  We'd rather eat at a great local place like this then pay the over-rated and over-priced fees of a lot of the restaurants in Casinos or on the strip.",

    "text": "Horrible service ruined this much anticipated experience. Made a reservation. Arrived 10 minutes early. Was able to see tables needed to be cleaned however no staff around to do it. Waited over 20 minutes past my reservation time to be seated due to no clean tables. Waitress treated us like an inconvenience however once we only ordered water for our beverage, I could tell by the look on her face that she knew it wasnt going to be a big ticket meal and she was annoyed. Waited another 15 minutes for bread. When she finally brought it she practically threw it on the table while walking by us. A different person brought us our food. She only followed up with us after a different person took our plates to bring us our check. Didnt even ask if we wanted anything else or dessert.   I was hoping a manager would be circulating the room to ask us how our dining experience was. No such luck. I witnesses a short Asian guy in a grey suit running back and forth in front of the cooks but he NEVER approached a guest.   My impression was this would be a classy place however the hostess is wearing nothing short of her work out clothes. I would have thought the hostess would have at least been dressed business casual or put on some real pants, maybe a pair of slacks but I guess this is the poor standard for Nora's.  I am a full time uber/lyft driver. I get tourists asking on a daily basis what are the good local restaurants. Once I saw Nora's had moved into their new location I thought I would try it out. I brought my Nephew who was visiting from out of state to try it with me. He is a waiter while finishing his last year of college. He was even disappointed with the service.   I will not be eating here again. I will definitely NOT be recommending any business to Nora's. Too much competition in Las Vegas to waste my time to give them a second try. Its a shame they opened this beautiful location however forgot they are in the service industry.",

The hostess at the front desk told us it'll be maybe 40 to 1 hr wait. So we're like okay, we'll wait. As we were waiting, we noticed that people who had reservations were waiting for almost 30 min for their table. Even the manager and the hostess were so frazzled that night they were giving each other attitude. We also noticed many of the tables were still waiting for their food. We even waited more than an hr. and the manager came to us and bribed us that their \"$10,000\" heating system outside was legit if want to sit outside in the cold. I don't care if it was $10,000 or 1 million. We specifically said we wanted to sit inside. So more than an hr passed. We left.  They have poor customer service and bad management.",

    "text": "This is the second time I've been to their new location, and it was so nice inside. I really like the design and atmosphere of the new place, and I'm glad they decided to relocate to a new building. It really sets to mood for Italian cuisine. We arrived passed 10 PM on a Friday night and they had plenty of seating. The hostess was friendly and seated us promptly. I forgot what our waiter's name was, but he was really attentive and friendly as well.   I ordered the lasagna and my friend got the ravioli with meatballs, and we shared a house salad. My friend said that her meatballs were cold, but the waiter put in another order and they were out right away. I usually order their specialty items which I really enjoy, but this time it was a little on the plain side. The lasagna was lacking a bit in flavor, however it was a big portion and I had leftovers for the next day. The house salad was good and fresh, although I prefer their Antipasto salad because it's huge and filling plus it comes with plenty of ingredients. Oh, and we also ordered the Sangria which was quite tasty!   Overall, it was a great experience especially since we stayed till after 1AM! And they didn't even rush us out or anything! There were still two tables on the bar side of the restaurant, and they didn't seem to be in a hurry to leave even after we left. I felt so bad because I didn't even realize that it was so late! So when I realized, I was so embarrassed and I immediately began to apologize the the staff. The staff was really nice and laid back, and they reassured me that it was completely okay because there were still customers eating and it's often the case that they stay very late to clean up. It just seemed like a regular day at the office to them, except they had such great attitudes about it. I presume that they have good management, because it really shows in their attitudes! If I could rate it with a 4.5, I would...I would have usually given a 5, but this time I felt the food was lacking that punch. Either way I just really, really like the new location...beautiful atmosphere, exceptional service and great food!",

We were fortunate to be guided by Angela. She had a great attitude and was very helpful with our choices. Gotta say her personality was stellar.  We had a nice Pinot Noir that paired well with the baked Rigatoni Special & spicy sauce I ordered. It was sooooo delicious and comforting. Love great pasta! Love Nora's!  Absolutely will come back here again next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Aaaah what happened to you?? This was my favorite Italian restaurant of ALL time. I am sad to say that I will have to find a new spot:(   I spoke so highly of Nora's, so when it was girl's night out, we had this place in mind. Parking can be a pain during the dinner rush because there are like 10 businesses sharing 50 spots. Make sure to give yourself some time for that. As for the restaurant itself, don't let the exterior fool you. The inside is nicer than the outside. To the right of the restaurant is the bar/lounge area and to the left is the more lit up family area.   Service was pretty normal. Nothing special, she was nice and did her job. The average rating goes towards the food. Like I said, this WAS my favorite spot until now. Let me explain why.   Garlic Bread: a few years ago it used to be thick slices of bread covered in butter with huge chunks of garlic right there staring at you. Bad breath for hours, but so good. Now, it's thin slices of bread with just garlic flavored butter. It's like something you could have bought in the frozen food section.   Appetizers: Cesar salad was pretty boring. And $5 for a few pieces of lettuce was way overpriced. The truffle fries were pretty boring too. Just plain French fries sprinkled with Parmesan. Boring all around. The fries did have a good crisp though.   Eggplant Parmesan: this is the ONLY thing I order off the menu. Pan fried eggplant covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella served with a side of spaghetti. Sounds good right? It was before. This visit I got a pile of mush. Maybe because they messed up my friend's pizza order so my dish was probably just chillin. Very disappointed.   All in all, I probably won't come back to Nora's. It still beats Olive Garden, but maybe I'll just stick with Bootlegger's from now on.",

Nick was our waiter and he was pretty good.  The food was good, but not amazing. I shared a house salad and the seafood pasta. They were good, OK, but not great. I guess I expected more. The place gets crazy busy, and I suppose they are better than some of the italian places here in Vegas, but truth is, if I want good italian, I cook it myself. But, I will most likely come back, and maybe, just maybe, it will be a much better experience.  Prices are good and service was good so that will garner a second trip! Maybe It's what I ordered.....???",

The service is horrible!!!  First of all the hostess is more concerned with blatantly flirting with other staff members than doing her job.  It was almost disgusting to see.  We were sat at a nice table and waited for our server. And we waited and waited and waited. After about 10+ minutes a waiter shows up and asks for our drink order. No apology for making us wait. He brings us water and our drinks and disappears. After about another 10 minutes another waiter comes and asks for our food order.  Again no apology for waiting and not even a hello.  Anything we needed - like more water - we had to flag our waiter down as he couldn't seem to notice more than one of his tables each time he was in the dining area.  He continually disappeared and we were left waiting, for everything. We wondered if this was his very first shift waiting tables.  There were two busboys who seemed to be working very hard but some how never made it to our table.   So finally our food arrives. And it is absolutely outstanding! Service might be horrible but the food is most definitely worth the visit. Just don't go unless you have time for a leisurely meal.   Word to management: train your wait and hostess staff! And then manage them!! The food is fantastic but you are losing guests due to horrible service.",

It came with a side of onion strings which were delish and some potato chips which unfortunately were not that great, saying that they were made on site, they tasted a little stale. Everything else even the diet coke was very good. We definitely will be back, my hubby had the rib eye steak it came with a salad it was the same price as the sandwich and my hubby says it was also very delicious. He could have went for an appetizer too, he loves to eat. Oh yes can't forget the amazing breadsticks very good as well.  Overall 5 stars. Apparently there is a line out the door we didn't experience that for lunch but we did notice they are building a Nora's restaurant on the corner that should be able to handle the larger crowds.",

We made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss. We were promptly seated and that is when everything started to go downhill. It took ~15 minutes to even get acknowledged and place our drink order. Their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house. I am not sure what would compel someone to pay $12 for gnocchi out of a package when I can get delicious gnocchi from Trader Joe's and toss in some pancetta for $5. I opted for their Frutti di Mare ($21) which was linguini in runny arrabiata sauce with an assortment of seafood. The husband had their carbonara which ranks among the worst I have ever had in the states. I am not even comparing this to Italy standards. While two of the three members of the party were still eating, one of the people's plates got taken away to be boxed up. Awkward. The server ignored our table pretty much most of the time and then rushed us out at the end. I would not come back nor recommend this place. It is all hype.",

The hostess had no idea, when I gave her they're name.  The party was 20 people, she should have known.  We had a problem with the service not picking up the empty plates. The manager walked by, I waved to him but I was ignored.  The manager never came over to ask if everything was alright.  When we booked this anniversary party, we said between 20 to 22 people. There was 20 people who came but we were charged for 22.  Because the bill was over $1200.00 we asked if they would remove the cost of the two they charged us. Management refused.  Even though a restaurant has good food, if the management & service is on the lower end of the spectrum it ruins the experience of dining at that establishment.  There we're other concerns that we're not mentioned on this review, that we're never mentioned when planning this anniversary party ahead of time.",

If you're looking for a fussy, hipster/trendy place, this restaurant is not it.  The restaurant was bustling when my date and I arrived, but we were sat immediately.  Somewhat annoying where we got placed though, which was a seat near the server's station.  They should move that table further down.  During the busiest hours, I'm sure it'd be annoying with servers going around you, \"excuse me, excuse me, coming through, whoops.\"  Food was fine.  I've had better Italian, but the food is fine for its price.  Nothing mind-blowing, the pasta could be softer, but that's just my preference.  Other than that, the seafood and the sauce was spot on.  My date got just regular chicken alfredo.  She hadn't tried that restaurant (although it was she who suggested the place).  She also would've liked her pasta softer, so maybe it isn't just me.  If you like Italian food as much as I do, try this place.  Oh, and be seated far from the kitchen/server's station- it'll help you dine with no interruptions.",

Our favorite (Booker) was available and this bartender knew how to make a cocktail.  A very generous pour and $9 is practically a steal for this bourbon.   We started with the spinach salad with farro which was a perfectly balanced combination with gorgonzola dressed in a delicious balsamic vinaigrette. The mussels arrabiata had a nice zip to the broth and the mussels themselves were the largest I've yet to come across in Las Vegas.  We also had to try something from the Josper Grill and went with an order of the pork belly which was rich and grilled to perfection.   We finished with the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken and we fought this morning over who was going to take the leftovers for lunch. In closing I must add that one of the hightlights of our dinner was our server Sebastiano.  What an delightful fellow and very attentive.",

The biggest downfall of this place is that it's too busy!  My favorite dish so far is the fettuccine carbonara. It's not really a fancy or special dish, but it's one that I like to try at a lot of different places. The waiter even asked me if I wanted to add peas (which add a lot to the dish and is usually in it anyways).  I've also had the chance to try the steak and arugula bruschetta, the chicken mount etna, and the rigatoni gorgonzola. All of them were very good, though the chicken mount etna might have been better with normal pasta rather than fried pasta.",

They forgot our garlic bread but once the waitress brought it, it was excellent too. I ordered the gnocchi with Alfredo sauce, and it wasn't good because their gnocchi is too sweet and chewy/doughy for house made gnocchi and I am a big gnocchi person--not worthy of comparison with Sage's gnocchi. My husband ordered the pasta primavera with Alfredo sauce and it was very tasty, highly recommend this dish for vegetarians. Taking off 1 star for gnocchi and one for the waitress being forgetful with aspergered behavior unless strictly business is her understanding of \"service\", as well as, rushing us a bit for no reason what so ever. She even grabbed the check book before we had a chance to go over it and pay. Will definitely come back to curb our pasta cravings and make sure she isn't our waitress--5'4 lady with her dark blond hair pinned up, in her 40s-50s, with black squared teacher glasses (she never gave us her name) who needs to get off her adderall!",

I don't want to give her name, but let's just say she's older one with no smile- to start things off she ask my father first what he was having - my dad said you mean you want to start with her ? ( meaning me ) she didn't say a word and waiting for my dad to order. We all were like wow! Never had anyone do that before - usually ladies first.. She was ok with refilling the drinks but,  a chip was on her shoulder the whole meal. I will definitely come back and still recommend to friends ... But I will ask to stay out of her section!! all the other wait staff had big smiles on thier face ... Seemed to be just her.  What a grump!",

We ordered a bottle of Merlot from Napa, California that was quite well rounded in flavor except for some sharp tannins at the uncorking. That worked itself out after letting the wine breath for about twenty minutes. It was vintage 2013 selling for $46 a bottle. Everyone at the table ordered pasta with red sauces. I ordered tomato and basil on penne with garlic and olive oil. I also asked for pine nuts on the side.      I digress our table also started out with a regular sized antipasto which I hear was outstanding. This was due to the meats being sliced into thin strips instead of full sized thin cuts. Therefore this helped bring out the flavor of the meat without it being overwhelming.      The garlic bread had a strong garlic flavor and was quite good. We went though two baskets of it while waiting for some of our other guests to arrive. This place is very popular and was almost full by six. The main dining areas are very loud and that makes it hard to talk. Other than that it was a very pleasant meal. I highly recommend this place. Other meals ordered were: Fruttie De Mare, Putenesca and Rigatoni. They all got raves! My meal made for a real bargain at twelve dollars and change. Definitely will be returning here.I really want to try the Mediterranean Sea Bass.",

I had a bone in veal chop on special that was out of this world. Others had the Frutti DI Mare and the Crazy Alfredo, veal etc.  Whomever had the nerve to give this place less then a 5 star review is foolish. The bar is on point, especially the Strawberry Daze and the wine was superb. I would and will recommend to anyone without hesitation. Had a large group and everyone had an amazing meal and great drinks.",

The service was top notch (note I sat at the bar), and Alex was very educational on all the items that I could order. She was on point with all the wines and spirits, and even more so on the custom drinks that Nora's is known for. Antipasta salad was awesome, and the veal shank parm was killer. A lot of food, but killer! This didn't come with pasta, but I wasn't looking for that. Dessert was a brioche ice cream sandwich, and it was mouthwatering. The bread was soft and sweet, with an amazing hazelnut gelato.  I will be going to back to Nora's to enjoy more of what the menu has to offer.",

Beautiful and clean environment- just the right volume of the background music to put you at ease. Cool technology Dyson facet/hand dryer device at restroom!  Loved the delicious food - antipasto salad was AMAZING! Lunch portion was generous with great price! We had the linguine with clams which was super tasty!! Fresh and homemade Italian food!  Special mention our server Ms. Cassie!!! Friendly and kind to my two little girls - 6 & 2.5 years old. She really made our family lunch so much more enjoyable because of her kindness calming down our little ones. I was impressed the way she agreed to mix 1/2 apple juice with 1/2 water to split between my girls - also lower their sugar intake. Brilliant!  A must try place for any occasion.

They hav an elevator or stairs to get up to the second floor. The restrooms have a sink with an faucet that also is connected to an air dryer, first time for me.

The best thing is the recipes have not changed it is still amazingly authentic and delicious. Staff always very friendly and an excellent bar with excellent bartenders who make excellent drinks did I mention the alcohol situation is excellent?  We love this place and will continue to come back again and again.  If you were looking for the perfect place to take that out of town just to show them the awesomeness outside of the strip...

Unfortunately, I forgot the name of my server but she was very attentive and did well considering I went with a huge birthday group. One thing I can point out is that my water always stayed filled. Most restaurants aren't too great with keeping water filled and I can be a stickler for that, but Nora's was on point. Before our meal we were served garlic bread and the amount of garlic was just perfect and buttery. The food menu had many various dishes to try. It was so hard to choose but I went for the Melrose, which is a linguini pasta with a creamy basil pesto sauce, zucchini, sun dried tomatoes, and topped with pine nuts. It was surprisingly very delicious. My group celebrated two birthdays and Nora's was able to provide a birthday treat for the birthday girls - tiramisu cake. The cake was soft, spongy and not too sweet. I also noticed as the night went by, they also had a band playing live music. Nice touch to the great atmosphere.",

Came here to celebrate a birthday..made reservations (highly recommended)..and was given an amazing table in a private room! Very nice setting.   The service was great! Constantly filling our waters and glasses of wine. Brought two nice bottles and it was $20 a bottle to open (but we were only charged for one..very nice!). The waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and had a lot of things to recommend for our big party.   Started with the large antipasto salad that was big enough to shared between 8 people..and had calamari also for the table! Very fried..usually like it less fried but still good. For entrees, ordered the rigatoni, cannelloni, linguini and clams, chicken marsala, chicken parmigiana, salmon, carbonara, and ravioli. All of it was incredible and had A LOT of leftovers! For desert had bread pudding and it was pretty good!   If you aren't in the mood for the strip and want a local Italian restaurant I highly recommend it. Will be back!",

There are three dining areas... One with the bar and Wine cellar decorating the main wall, another with a more quite ambiance, and a private room. My favorite?...of course it's the one with the bar and wine cellars!  We came here most recently on a Tuesday night with a reservation...it was packed at 6:30pm, so I do recommend you make a reservation, regardless of the day. The bar seating is first come, first serve, and lots of patrons were waiting for a table to open up the entire time we dined here.  Our family ordered  Chicken Marsala with Pesto Pasta Fritti de Mar Salmon Carciofi Eggplant Parmagian Calamari Fritti Arachni  Once you're seated, they bring out a basket of garlic bread...so good.  We all enjoyed our dishes, especially my daughter who insisted on Nora's Italian Cuisine for the evening! The poirtions were huge, and most of us had some left over to take home.   When I made a reservation over the phone, the lady I spoke to asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion...I let her know that we were, and when we finished meal, our waiter brought out a delicious dessert of Lady Fingers with \"Congrats\" written on the plate. Everything he did came with a genuine smile, which made it all extra special for our family.   With new location, new decor and superb staff, I am loving Nora's, with something for everyone in the family to enjoy!  Thank you Nora's staff, you all made our evening so special!",

I saw Norman making this smoked rosemary drink often and when he told me it's possibly the best cocktail on the menu, I tried that one even loving copper rose so much. It did not disappoint: It is SO GOOD. Flavor, little foam on top and you smell the rosemary with every sip. Just saw. Food is excellent here too.

For apps, our group started with the Calamari Fritti and Mozzarella Caprese. The Calamari was perfectly fried and served with a sort of creamy tomato sauce. I'd definitely get that again. The Mozzarella Caprese was also great. I'd never had fresh mozzarella like that so it was a real treat. My entree was my go to for Italian restaurants, Chicken Parmigiana. The tender cutlet was perfectly fried and the sauce was amazing. The spaghetti underneath was also perfectly done. Service was excellent. Very attentive.  In the end, Nora's did not disappoint in the least and you can see why it's highly regarded. It's a beautiful space, has excellent service and the food is top shelf. I'd definitely like to return.

    "text": "This place stays busy for a reason! With all the food trends nowadays, it's reassuring to know that some \"old faithful\" restaurants remain -- places that feel special but also familiar.  My first time here, I had heard nothing but amazing things... and having a dinner filled with luxurious sauces and attentive service at a place at embodies classic Italian felt timeless. The menu is long with over 70+ items, showcasing a wide variety of Italian dishes, from simple pastas to lush seafood and meat creations dreamed up by the kitchen. (Did I mention complimentary to-die-for garlic bread?!)   Ordered: - CRAZY ALFREDO (fettucini, chicken, sausage, shrimp, porcini mushrooms, button mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, jalapenos) -- granted I held the jalapenos, but wow! The sumptuous combination of meat & vegetables bathed in a rich alfredo sauce proves that this dish is a classic for a reason!  - WILD BOAR PAPARDELLE (fresh pasta with wild boar bolognese) --  this dish showed off the kitchen's skill with lush sauces! The wild boar meat, tender enough to cut with a fork, was dressed with a delicate, velvety sauce on top of filling, broad, flat pasta noodles. - ALLA NORA (spaghetti, eggplant, meat sauce, pesto, parmigiano cheese) -- the combination of spaghetii and eggplant with chunky, fragrant tomato sauce seemed less upscale than the other entrees, but the melted cheese topped with pesto sauce gave it a flavorful charm!  On top of that, I paired my dish with their RED SANGRIA -- which had an amazing mix of red wine, peach and orange liqueur and mixed fruit.   We topped our meal off with dessert overload: BRIOCHE BITES (hazelnut gelato sandwiched between two sweet buns) and the PISTACHIO CANNOLI (pastry shell, vanilla ricotta, pistachio & chocolate chips). All I can say is that we left with full, satisfied bellies -- and nothing but good things to say. We will definitely be back... Thank you to everyone at Nora's for a fine Italian dining experience!   PRO TIP: Making a reservation is necessary! This place gets crazy busy and the wait times can be extensive!",

The cuisine I think tastes a little less authentic since its moved to it's new location.  With that said, it still offers amazing Italian food at a great price.  I've been about 3 times to the new location and I'm sure I'll keep coming back.",

    "text": "Looking to try something new in Vegas, leafing thru Yelp reviews saw Nora's and decided to give it a try.  While the Yelp app doesnt have a 'reservations' link, it does have Nora's website listed, and from Nora website reservations can be made via OpenTable.  Interestingly, I tried going direct thru OpenTable (so I could get points) and the OpenTable app was so awful, and didnt even list Noras in its' Italian directory! Anyway, doing it via the link anonymously worked fine.  Showed up 730pm (Saturday night) - the place was hopping, with a line, but we were seated on time by the friendly front of house staff.  Water quickly brought out, and, the waiter asked FIRST if we wanted straws (yay) which we declined.    Appetizers: Olives ($6.50) - about a dozen+ green kalamata olives with a little garnish; tasty, yes with pits, could have added other olive varieties i thought instead of just one kind. Grilled Octopus:  OMIGOD this was delicious - about a dozen pieces, beautifully cooked, lightly seasoned with garnish, very tender and yummy with smoky grilled flavor  We ordered individual dishes; my son Ben had Crazy Alfredo($24), wife the Melrose Chicken($17.50), and i had the shrimp scampi ($22)  My son and wife really enjoyed their entrees (the pesto in the Melrose, fabulous, and tender chicken); the shrimp scampi perfectly cooked, in a bath of buttery garlic broth i sopped up with the free bread, 6 large shrimp.  As far as portions, the scampi was the only dish I think an ordinary human could consume in one sitting (I did); the crazy alfredo and melrose chicken were enormous, so we took the remains back to the hotel room, which is not a good idea in Vegas where strip hotels have no refrigerators/microwaves.  I assume you can order family style here (we werent sure, and werent asked), probably next time we would order just two entrees for 3 people and go family-style.  Bonus green star - take home was earth-friendly, in compostable containers, in a paper bag.  The server monitoring drinks was superb, water and soft drinks filled at the perfect time.  Perhaps the only drawback here was processing the check; it took quite a while after we were clearly finished to be asked about dessert (which we declined, stuffed), and my credit card sat there so lonely for so long while our waiter was working other tables, I gave up and dug into my gambling cash and left the money on the table.  At 9pm there was still a line out the door, so perhaps they should focus a little harder giving people the option to leave quickly (but not rush them)  We had a delightful meal, loved the wonderful ambiance, beautiful table settings, great service, and very reasonable prices - and earth-friendliness.",

The welcoming bar will make you want to drink!  The large patio will make you want to step outside to enjoy the stars.  Their food and service was excellent.  The house salad tasted fresh.  The chicken parmesean was on point.  The fettucini was amazing!  It had everything in it.   Even the complimentary bread would have been worth a price.  If you are looking for a great dining experience that won't break the bank, this is the spot to be.  I'll be back again for sure when in town.    I too enjoy a meal off the strip once in a while and I'm known for endless comps from the hotels and casinos.",

Plus the waiter waived it for the second bottle which was nice. If you're looking for a traditional Italian restaurant with good bowls of pasta and a casual environment And this is a good one.

I think this is the best calamari I have ever had. They also had the best garlic bread. It was crunchy yet still soft enough it won't break your teeth. The pesto was creamy and rich. The shrimp was cooked well. My friends got the Crazy Alfredo and they also loved it. The birthday guy was savoring every flavor.   On a side note, I met the son of the owner at a volunteer event and I can say that they are great people as well! They are involved in their community :).",

While we were waiting for dinner it took the waiter a long time to refill our waters.  He was walking around and passed by our table a few times without checking on us.  Once we got our meals, which took a bit of time because of the large party in the other room, the food was great.  I ordered a cup of coffee, $2.00+, with desert.  We were very polite and understanding during the long waits.  I drank my coffee and waited for a refill and he would just walk by.  He came by once and I asked if I could get a refill and he was a little put out by my asking.  The real slap in the face came when the manager came by and I voiced my disappointment with out service with her.  I was polite and said I had heard such good things about the restaurant I was surprised at the service.  Her only action was to \"give\" us a calendar of their recipes.  Which I had seen her give out to everyone who came through the door.  The food was great however I won't be going back again.  There are many other places to spend my money for real local food.",

We found Nora's and always impressed with the service and price at this Italian eatery that started many years ago as a pizza joint.  Even on a week night, reservations are recommended.  A typical evening will show you 5-6 different servers all focused on your needs...  One does beverages, one does bread, one takes your order, one does water, another serves your order...  And they communicate very well so you dont even notice that it is someone different each time.  The food there can be good to great.  The portions, generally speaking, are not huge but filling, but they are priced right.  For dinner for two, we plan about $40.  I have taken clients here for lunch, and have not been disappointed.  Saturday nights can get noisy as they have a singer who comes in.  This is a favorite date night spot for us, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some good, \"real\" Italian food!",

We came around 4pm, good thing because 30 minutes later it started getting packed! Hostess wasn't really a hostess, didn't really greet us or talk much as she was sitting us at our table but anyways, the server made up for that, she was great. We ordered the arancini & the house salad for apps and my boyfriend got a cup of the pasta fagioli also some complimentary garlic bread. The arancini was delicious I could've eaten all 4 myself lol the salad was yummy. The soup was kinda flavorless, needed more salt, and the garlic bread was great. For dinner I had the Alla Nora (Eggplant with Meat sauce & pesto) and my boyfriend had Rigatoni special (rigatoni, sauce, sausage, meatballs, peppers & onions). Only complaint I had about the Alla Nora is wayyyyyyyy too much parm cheese on it, like literally the whole thing covered and made it way too cheesy and salty. Next time I will ask without the cheese so I can put it on myself. My boyfriend liked the rigatoni, the meatballs were delicious. As for dessert we had a cannoli which was yummy and some Oreo ball icecream thing which was great. Will def be coming back again!",

    "text": "My husband and I didn't want to eat on the strip as they are often overrated and overpriced. After looking into Italian foods (I wanted pasta) here on Yelp, we decided to eat at Nora's.  Pretty easy to find, but I agree that the exterior didn't really do its justice for what was offered inside.    PROS: The food was pretty decent for Vegas and for its price.  I had the \"crazy\" alfredo (due to my pregnancy hormones, I had to substitute the chicken for clams).  NOT BAD AT ALL!!!  The Jalapenos actually worked really well in this dish. The portions were pretty big. Had the warm chocolate cake for dessert...it was ok.  I mean, can't really go wrong with chocolate but I've had better.    CONS:  Had to wait at least 15 mins for a table even though it was obvious that there were empty tables around.  The hostess never offered an explanation as to the wait.  As she stepped away, a random waitress had to search for the hostess to seat us..as she wonders why we had to wait.   The lasagna.  My husband didn't really like the ricotta cheese...instead he helped me finish my pasta.    Though they mixed up my food (the substitution in my pasta), they seemed really apologetic...and the service was great.  I didn't get our server's name but he was friendly and actually took the lasagna off our bill (we didn't even had to ask!).  SO all in all, it was a good experience...yeah we would go back...I would recommend it to others...especially if you just want to casually dine off the strip.",

For desert, I had the canoli and shared a tiramisu with my wife, both deserts were very delicious. Overall, I'd go again and recommend it to anyone looking for great, homestyle Italian food.",

This place has the atmospere that many of the larger chains try so hard to achieve.  The in-house jazz band cranks out standards on specific nights of the week, but I'm not sure which nights they play.  Live music, great food and a friendly staff = A++",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to try Nora's Cuisine due to a bartender that was so rude to my date and I, that we both decided it would be best to leave. We had arrived for our reservation early and was told by the host that it would be just a moment for our table to be ready. As a result, we decided to go into the bar and have a cocktail before dinner. After waiting at the end of the bar for a period of time with the bartender aware of us waiting, we watched the bartender clean the bar, talk with other guests and walk over to talk to the other bartender before he finally made eye contact with us and signaled us to come to him at the middle of the bar with a wave of his head. When we walked over, I mentioned, \"I didn't think you saw us\", to which he gave a rude smirk. Without any prior interaction with this bartender, we were at a loss as to why we were treated this way. Seeing how this was our first visit to Nora's, we did not want to chance sitting down and possibly having the same treatment from other members of their staff and ruining our evening so, we thought it best to just leave and have dinner elsewhere.",

The Shrimp Scampi dish was the best. The salad and bread was an excellent appetizer. The only gripe that I really have at Nora's was the wait staff. It seemed I never even seen the waiter the whole time we were eating and to tell you the truth if the waiter is not going to be on top of their game and they have the bus boy doing majority of the work they might as well stay at home. I believe our waiter will be fired in the near future if he keeps his ways up. Even after the bus person served us our desserts and toke great care of our family. I was surprised and irritated that the waiter took his time even taking care of our bill. Needless to say his tip fell shy of 10%. Times are tough in the economy. He should be so lucky to still have a job. Waiters in Vegas be aware people that work, meaning, the ones that still have jobs. They work hard for their money and when they go out they want excellent service. His butt was saved because of the great food and the Bus boy. Next time he may not be so lucky.   Sean",

I get so distracted, focus.. best place to dine is the bar side for sure. There is a old school 3 piece band which plays everything from frank to nat king cole with a rare spotting of kareoke if you get lucky.   the food is pretty good, italian is tough from me because of my broken english family from the old country. i enjoyed there chicken plate that looks like a volcano or my aunts hair.. Goodfellas style! The appetizers are nice and everything is seasoned good. i think sometimes they get so crowded that they lose some of that love that goes into cooking. great atmosphere and great music. have fun!

I was disappointed only at the fact I got so full cause I really wanted to try their canolis lol delish delish delish is all I can say!",

Until this last trip, when the hubs and I needed to get away from the madness of the strip and stumbled across Nora's. Best. Decision. Ever. Loved the food--- but only for lovers of garlic and if EVERYONE participates! The meat sauce was literally the best I've ever had. And the fact that it's family owned and run? Bellisima!!! Brava!!!",

    "text": "Wow! This place was great! Service was amazing and the food quality matched. I never had to ask for a refill or wait for our waiter to come, even though it was a packed house.  We were seated by the kitchen, which is open in the center of the restaurant. Normally I don't like being seated by the kitchen, but it was kinda fun watching how organized and fluid they were when working.   I ordered the huge ribeye steak (16 oz), calamari, and tirimisu for dessert. The calamari is a large portion and the dipping sauce was out of this world with a beautiful basil flavor. The steak was juicy and tender and flavored well. The tirimisu was good too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but I would encourage you to make a reservation to be safe because it was packed on a Monday night that we went. I'm sure the weekend would be a long wait otherwise.",

We also had friends led bronzini- grilled while so watch for bones.less expensive pasta dishes are filling and totally satisfying for spaghetti lovers. This is a fine restaurant. Service was terrific, parking lot a little small and puck a time to avid the wait. But once you get seated, you will be happy.",

The service was incredibly slow.   We had Cabrese salad - Pretty good Veal Parm and Egg Plant Parm along with Spaghetti with Marinara.  The veal was pretty tough and the sauce tasted tinny as did the sauce on the pasta. The same was True for the eggplant. It tasted like they either over spiced with something or we were getting flavor from the cans they used.",

    "text": "I've been to Nora's twice and had somewhat different experiences.   Both times that I went the food was very good. I've tried their gnocchi, and their fettuccini Alfredo. The gnocchi was very good, not the best that I've had in Las Vegas, but it was delicious. Everyone that I've dined with at Nora's has enjoyed their meal.  The first time I visited Nora's was with a large group, so I can understand that service was a little slow. The next time we visited with a small party the service was excellent.   The dining room is crowded but has great ambiance - exactly what you would expect from a nice Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, you may not be seated in the dining room. The second time I visited this restaurant was when my mother was in town, and we took her to Nora's because she wanted a nice Italian dinner for her last night in Vegas. We did not have a reservation, and we were happy to wait for a table. After waiting for a few minutes we weren't taken into the dining room but instead sat next to the bussing station and kitchen. There's a tiny row of tables behind the hostess station - it's noisy,  busy with servers running food from the kitchen, and warm. I realize that this restaurant is small and busy, but I don't think it's an acceptable place to seat diners at a restaurant with prices this high. It was made even worse by the fact that the only people sitting in this area were people who were more casually dressed. So, I guess if you would like a nice seat at this restaurant either make a reservation specifying a table in the dining room or make sure you aren't dressed casually. Either way, I don't think I'll be back. There are many places in this city to get good Italian food at a lower price point with just as much ambiance as you would get sitting next to the kitchen at Nora's.",

I made a reservation but my party members were late.  The hostess had no problems with this and I was seated promptly when my party arrived a few minutes later.  You walk into Nora's and you see a part of the kitchen immediately.  To the left and right are dining areas that are reminders of what you would expect at an Italian dining establishment: lower lights, intimate areas, cozy, etc.    We were seated and given bread.  We then ordered some wine and beer which was reasonably priced considering it is Las Vegas.  I had the house specialty seafood pasta with a caesar salad; all perfect and as tasty as expected.  The other members of my party had Chicken Parmigiana and an Eggplant Parmigiana.  Both were also great when I tried them.  The restaurant is very good in most ways, and I recommend it to anyone looking for quality Italian cuisine.  It just did not blow me away in any category to earn that fifth star.",

They must've forgotten to bring it out? We also noticed it wasn't the same quality as the previous year, almost as if it were from a cafeteria. They have certainly compromised quality in the past year. Waiter wasn't apologetic at all for the cold, late food. Either way we won't be back.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Nora's in the past week.  We stopped in for lunch one day because we have heard from two people how good this place is.  Lunch prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing.    The lunch service was a little slow but I'll tell you what, the FOOD was worth the wait.  We got the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta as an appetizer and it was out of this world!!!   AMAZING!!!  They do bring you a small basket of Garlic Bread, the first one is on them the menu says and then $2.50 after that.  The bread is amazing but when you get a basket with just 4 small pieces for two people and then want to charge me $2.50 for another 4 pieces, that I may question.  I had the Rigatoni Special and the sauce, the sausage, the meatballs, OMG... we also a Nora special which is not on the togo menu so I cannot tell you the exact name but I was told it was the BEST they have ever had.  So since our experience with the food was SO AMAZING, we decided to go back last night and bring my daughter and her husband.  Of course we had the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta and they ordered the regular Bruschetta and both were again very good.  We also ordered the regular Antipasto Salad which we have had in a lot of Italian places and this was by far the BEST.  This time I decided to try the Chicken Parmigiana which you can get breaded or not and it was AMAZING..  The portion size was give me a to go box size which I did take home.  We also had the Veal Chop Parm, a $42 plate but I tell you what, the size of this Bone in Veal was so big, it came home and provided two more meals.  My daughter had the baked Rigatoni and her husband had the Snow White Pizza.  I guess he was having a Disney moment.    Both dishes were amazing and to go boxes were in order for those as well.  he ordered the medium pizza and it was big enough for 2 to 3 people.    They all wanted deserts and OMG, the cheesecake is to DIE for, no you won't die if you eat it but after all the food you might explode, the Cookies and Cream Tartufo was amazing, the Panna Cotta was WOW and then a Toasted coconut drink with drambui, and brandy was the topping on the meal.  My friend Frank from AZ comes here all the time and this place was packed non stop last night until about 8:30 then it started to slow down, but I truly understand why Frank says there is NO PLACE like this in Vegas for food of this quality.  Everyone from the hostess to the Manager last night were some of the warmest and friendliest people who ensured the place was running like a well oiled machine and they did an AMAZING JOB!!!  Many kudos to the kitchen and the entire staff, this is one of the BEST Italian places we have ever found her in Las Vegas and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and we will be back often, it is just that good.  They do not give military discounts but that is ok, this place is so good I will support them and so should you.  The prices are very reasonable and it is worth every penny.  I don't want to see corners cut to provide a discount and GOOD FOOD is worth paying for and this place is for REAL!!!!",

I got there before they even opened for the day and I'm glad I did as it got real busy around 11:30!  That's always a good sign.  We got calamari which was tender and crisp.  I got gnocchi in Alfredo sauce which was creamy and absolutely fabulous.  We also got the rib eye sandwich with gorgonzola topped with onion strings and homemade potato chips on the side plus a basket of fries.  It had huge chunks of meat and the rich and tangy flavor of the gorgonzola complements the meat.  For everything we got, I only paid less than $40!  The service was good.  Remember to check-in so you can get a free glass of wine.  The free garlic bread is great.  You can definitely taste the garlic which I love.",

I expected to get some good home cooked Italian food... WRONG. If you can mess up the simplest dish like lasagna how can you really call your self an Italian restaurant. The service was incredibly slow seeing that they weren't even busy. We had to ask two different servers for our check because our waiter was no where to be found. Save your self the headache don't go to this place there's many many more Italian restaurants in Las Vegas that will live up to your expectations.",

It was cramped but the food and service always left you with a good feeling despite the close quarters.  I think we are giving up on the new location though.  It started with a takeout order.       I had ordered a good amount of food including a chocolate cake.  \"That cake takes like half an hour\", said the person on the phone.  They told me to pick it all up in half an hour.  I arrived and the hostess seemed irritated by my presence.  She came back with my food sans cake.  \"You know that takes like half an hour to cook\", she told me about the cake.  Her tone suggested I was a dumbass for ordering cake.  My food sat on the host's stand getting cold while I sat and waited for cake at the bar.  The bar tender asked what I wanted and I told him I was waiting for cake.  \"That takes like half an hour\", he said.  Thanks bud.  I asked to speak to the manager and told him my beefs.  He was very professional and gave me a voucher for $30 off my next meal.  Cool.        Several weeks later my wife and I pop in late in the afternoon with the plan of getting some apps and cocktails.  We used to do this frequently at the old location.  We loved the arancini and calamari.  We sat at the bar and were unacknowledged for ten minutes despite multiple people behind the bar.  It appeared the person who's section were in had tables outside the bar that needed his attention and the other bartender was not going to bother with us because we were not in his section.  This just made me sad because, as someone who worked in restaurants for years, I really admired the teamwork and camaraderie at the old location. It just gave you a good feeling while you were there.  We were never ignored there.  We got up and left, if anyone noticed they didn't care.       The last time, still holding the $30 voucher, was around 5:00 last Saturday.  I approached the host stand, met with a rather curt, \"yes?\" from the hostess.  \"Table for two please\" I said.  She looked left, and then looked right at the half-empty dining room.  \"It's going to be about half an hour unless you want to sit on the patio\" she said.  It was about 110 degrees that day.  She cared more about keeping the sections even than getting people served.  As we left disappointed I told my wife, \"I'm tired of holding on to this stupid voucher, I've had it in my wallet for almost six months.\"  \"Just give it to someone\" she said.  So I handed it to a dad in the waiting area and finally severed my maddening tie with this indifferent restaurant.",

Fettuccine Carbonara - EL FUEGO! One of the best pasta dishes I've had in recent memory....  Baked Rigatoni - Not my favorite...and was bland...

When you drive up to it, on the outside it's a dump; a typical strip center that's seen the better years behind it. Once inside, it's cozy, especially the side with the bar.   The food is excellent as is the service.  Great Negronis and a decent wine list at reasonable prices. In fact, all the prices are reasonable.   It's a homey place great for the whole family.   My favorite place in town is still Panevino, but this is my second favorite.   And the espresso is wonderful, too.",

With the only options 4pm, 4:15pm and 4:30pm, we picked 4:30pm. When we got there at 4:20pm, not only the restaurant was full, the reception area was also full of people. When we finally made it through the crowd and get to the hostess, we were told that they just need to clear up a couple of tables then it'll be our turn.   After couple minutes into the wait, I realized pretty much EVERYONE around us HAS MADE reservations. I hate to assume they overbooked but I guess I'd never find out what really was going on. Because we left empty stomach after standing in the annoyed crowd after an hour. By the way, my husband did check with them one last time before we left. The answer was the same, \"We just need to clear couple tables.\"  Well, my three stars are for 1. The hostesses kept their sweet smile on even they knew everyone was hating them. 2. They dedicated one employee to serve the waiting crowd sparkling wine and she always came back with more. 3. Our love for Nora's based on our past experiences.  So obviously we were not happy and really disappointed with this one experience so I decided to leave this review and only three stars. Hopefully the owner and the management will notice their overall rating is going south since they moved into this new location and do something about it. Check out other reviews if you will.   We will definitely go back in a month or two. That's enough time for them to fix the problems. Hopefully they will bring back the Nora's we've always loved.",

They turned an intimate hole in the wall restaurant, to a place that is now lacking in every area.  The food that was amazing, is now mediocre at best. To be honest, the food doesn't even taste the same. The attentive service that once was, is now gone, it took 20 minutes to get drinks (and I got water).  Mind you, when they finally brought out my water the glass wasn't clean and had lipstick stains on the rim. Cool. The seating is too close together, which makes it hard to move around the restaurant.   I might give it one more try, but all I kept saying when I was there was how sad I was that Nora's is ruined. They should of stayed at the old location.",

An amazing cocktail and meal is how I splurge on myself and that is definitely what I received at Nora's. I ordered a Bombay sapphire gin martini and yes it came with those amazing soft blue cheese stuffed olives where little bubbles of oily fat dance on the top of your ice cold martini. (Magic) I enjoyed a roasted veggie starter and veal Milanese with a salad which was all so perfectly prepared and so delicious. I do have tummy issues so sometimes after I eat after not eating for a while everything hurts so much, and it's not the foods fault, but I was able to leave just as fast as I wanted to go suffer in the car. This was the most professionally run restaurant I have been to yet! Not one bartender flirted with me (believe it or not I came for the food, JUST the food) and not one bitchy side comment from a waitress. I've been to award winning restaurants in town and treated like something less than a paying customer. Not gonna happen here folks!",

The bartenders know what's going on here.  The negatives: THE WAIT!  I'm tired of the wait here. We've been here 3 times at the new location, and only once did we get our food within 45 minutes of ordering it. We waiting and hour and 10 minutes the last time we were there. That is unacceptable.   It's hard to talk negatively about a restaurant whose food you love, but I really just don't think it's worth the wait at this point. The service is WAY. TOO. SLOW.

Note that from the promotional flyer/banner at the door, they're moving to a bigger location right around the area. We got confirmation from the wait staff, so the next time we're in Vegas, we'll visit their new location. I had my super-duper mouthwatering seafood pasta and hubby got his veal.

We dipped the complimentary garlic bread in the delicious broth the mussels were sitting in and boy was it a party in my mouth!! Entrees we had the linguini with clams and the alla Nora and both were phenomenal!!!  Dessert we had the Oreo tartufo. Chocolate heaven! Ambience was very authentic Italian and so was the food. Bernadette was our server and she was such a sweetheart!! Will request her when we come back. My only thing to say negatively is that it was freezing in there!! Literally like an ice box. I even had 2 glasses of red wine and was still cold!! We did ask Bernadette if there was something they could do about the temp and a few minutes later we saw a gentleman mess around with the thermostat. It did help but not much. No biggie though. Next time I'll just bring a jacket. Problem solved! Thanks again Bernadette and to all who helped make this a great dining experience!!",

    "text": "Although it was a weeknight and Las Vegas itself was not crowded, a reservation was recommended -- and it was needed because this place was full or very close to it. All the customers were smiling and having a fine time. It was hard to choose from the extensive menu because everything sounded so good, and the plates of the other diners all looked wonderful. The more expensive dishes are gargantuan while the less expensive ones are merely huge.  I decided on pasta alla Nora since it is something I couldn't get elsewhere. It is spaghetti covered with meat sauce, cheeses, and pesto (which I didn't notice if it was present), then topped with bite-sized slices of eggplant and baked or more likely broiled. If you like eggplant, it's heavenly. It looked like a manageable portion to begin with; I actually breathed a sigh of relief that I wouldn't be overwhelmed. However, I ended up bringing half of it home with me; it was much bigger than it looked. My friend ordered the fettucine carbonara, and we both agreed it was the best we'd ever tasted. We both loved the garlic bread.  Before we ordered a bottle of wine, we asked whether it could be capped and taken home if we didn't drink it all. Our waiter had to go and check; yes, we could. The bottle we ordered was sold out, so he substituted another wine and reduced the price for us. Great service and a really sweet waiter.  I'd love to try the pizza as well as everything else on the menu. Delicious!",

Noras recently moved to a new location just a few blocks east of where they've been forever . Beautiful restaurant and excellent decor. Place is stunning . Had a 645 reservation on a Tuesday for a 30th b day party. Only four of us.  Wasn't seated until 700pm. Had to flag down the manager and ask why walk ins were being seated before us?  Eventually he sat us and bought us a round of drinks. Don was our server as he has been for many other visits and did a great job as always. Appetizers came out in a timely fashion 10-12 minutes but we waited a full hour to get our entrees. This is not an exaggeration . Manager Dan was apologetic and compensated our table with many rounds of drinks and a reduced bill, but that's not why we visit Nora's.  I did not want a free drink (was drinking sprite) i wanted to enjoy my meal.  The food is always spot on but they were not ready to open at the new building. The kitchen was buried , one hour for entrees is inexcusable.  He said they are working on getting ready for the Grand Opening which is in a couple weeks which made us feel unimportant.  That is why you run a play day and a soft opening with friends and family of the employees to work out the kinks before opening to the public.  It was an awkward dinner to say the least.  We will return eventually but not any time soon.  I put this on the owner of Nora's not on the manager or server.  Don't open unless you are prepared",

When you see a restaurant in a strip mall, I think you're always a little wary, but this place definitely shines.   Staff was super friendly and got us seated fast (without a reservation). The caesar salad was fresh and delicious-- which is great, because I can't even count how many Italian joints try to pass off jar caesar dressing as fresh- ugh. The gnocchi with vodka sauce was super delicious.   Unlike the others, I wasn't terribly impressed with the garlic bread, but hey- you can't win 'em all :)",

Then it seemed to take forever for our entrees to come out and when they finally did, my entree (Alla Nora) was cold. Not even lukewarm. Everyone else's was fine. The manager was great, they re-made my order and when it was served it was piping hot.  I asked for the leftovers to be boxed and they came back with a bag which I thought had my food. However, when I was home and went to reheat it, it wasn't there. It was my boyfriends pasta that he didn't even want to take home. How disappointing the whole experience was.",

Everywhere a traveler goes is greeted by chains, cheap \"bargain\" places that scare me, or fancy culinary experiences that may be great, but not necessarily affordable by a family of four.  That's why it's worth finding what the locals like.  Nora's Cuisine is such a place.    Our first mistake was not making a reservation - its very busy on a Saturday night with an active, upscale bar crowd and live music.  We sat in one of two other rooms which was also very nice and not too noisy.    The food was quite good and very reasonable, especially considering that the portions were large and filling.  The menu was varied and interesting, so my two picky eaters were happy.    Make no mistake; I've had much better Italian food, but this place was comfortable, friendly, not too fancy (Jeans OK, shorts no), and good service for a decent price.  The next time in Vegas, I'll probably return.",

The food is amazing it's a cute restaurant with great service. Everything I have eaten there has been delicious including- chicken Alfredo, Veal, pretty much any pasta is awesome! And OMG the pistachio chocolate is to die for!!! The best dessert you will ever have if you like pistachios and chocolate. You have to order it early because they make it fresh when ordered so I recommend ordering it right when u sit down to make sure there won't be a wait when you are ready for it. It's got a warm melty center and soft outside drizzled in the pistachio sauce. I cannot tell you how good this is. This restaurant has been my favorite for years and will continue to be as long as they keep doing what they are doing! There is also a room for large parties in the back that is really nice and the doors close if you want it more of a private party. There is live music on the weekends not sure about weekdays. It gets a little cramped but not too bad. Overall awesome place to eat!",

The dinner salad was fantastic, the tea was fresh and delicious. We each had an entree. She ordered spaghetti and meatballs and I had linguine and clam. Each entree was perfect. We also ordered a side of green olives in a special oil, they were really great. I am hard to please, yet had no complaints. The restaurant was run efficiently and appeared clean and spotless. All servers were professional and friendly. We never asked for a refill and were offered more garlc bread often. My wife and I  have found a new favorite Italian restaurant!  5 stars in every category: service, atmosphere, food quality, and authenticity. By the time we left the place was full and on a Monday night to boot.",

    "text": "I heard great things about Nora's so we decided to give it a try.  It's literally in a strip mall on Flamingo/Jones. And, decor is nothing spectacular. I was, also, a little disappointed with paper tableclothes, but if the food was good I was willing to overlook it.  We sat in the dining room to the left of the entrance which had tables right on top of each other, so definately not a place togo if you want any sort of quiet or private setting. It was kinda loud actually, and we were very aware of the birthday party happening to our right and the party of 12 to our left.  They give you a basket of garlic bread to start (1st basket is free) and it wasn't very good...it seemed just like anything frozen you can buy at the grocery store.  We were never offered a wine list, which I thought was odd. Aside from this, I thought the service was really good.  We ordered 2 entrees...chicken parmesan & sausage rigatoni.  The chicken parm was an unbreaded breast with tons of cheese, and pretty tasteless. It was served with about a pound of pasta (literally). I make better chicken parm at home. The sausage dish was actually my husband's, but I did get to sample the left overs. He thought it was excellent.   For desert he had some sort of oreo ice cream dipped in chocolate. I had a traditional canoli. We respectively, gave these a B.  They had quite a list of dessert martinis, as well, and I couldn't resist trying the banana coconut cream pie martini. It was pretty small, but really strong, and didn't taste much like any thing except alcohol.  The entire check came to around $50 for 2 people.  Overall, Nora's was just OK. I probably won't go again simply because I think there are much better places to get an Italian food fix. But, atleast I can say I've gone.",

    "text": "A friend from out of town introduced me to Nora's about six months ago and it's easily now my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas off the Strip. As an Italian who's lived in Vegas for 10+ years and has close family members living in Italy, I'm embarrassed and angry at myself for not trying this place years ago.  I was skeptical when I saw it was situated in a small space in a dingy strip mall, but my concerns were squashed when I walked in and saw how busy it was on a weekday night. In fact, I highly recommend making a reservation if you're the impatient type who doesn't like to wait (especially since their waiting area is extremely small).  The starters are all excellent with the Calamari Fritti, Antipasto Salad, and Steak & Arugula Bruschetta being my favorites. The entrees range from the Italian classics to the Crazy Alfredo, which is easily one of their most popular dishes. It features fettucine Alfredo filled with chicken, sausage, jumbo shrimp, porcini mushrooms, domestic mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes and jalapenos.   The prices at Nora's are also more than reasonable, especially for the \"basic\" pasta items (cannelloni $9.95, lasagna $10.50, rigatoni $12.95, fettucine carbonara $12.95, fettucine Alfredo $10.50, pasta primavera $10.50, etc).   Whatever you decide to order, the food is exceptional and it's just as good or better than many of the Italian restaurants on the Strip. Nora's location and building may not live up to your standards, but the quality of the food will make you forget all about it.",

We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!  The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.  We started with calamari and it was so good.  Their sauce that they make to go with it was perfect as well (not just your typical marinara sauce that most restaurants use).  Their small basket of garlic bread was to die for.  My dad ordered a veal chop that was butterflied with the bone on.  THIS THING WAS HUGE!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered a linguinni in pesto cream sauce with shrimp and pine nuts. It was a little rich for me but was incredibly delicious.  We did try a tiramisu for dessert and I'm very picky about that particular dessert but it was home made and I think most people would really like it, I didn't care for it though.    My overall experience is DEFINITELY 5 stars and I'd go back any time.  It's a GREAT place for some good upscale home made italian food.  Just don't forget your reservations cause they are very busy.",

If I could critique Nora's on any one thing, it would be \"charm.\" That *something* was missing. What happens at a lot of Italian restaurants is that after a certain period of time, the family goes new school. They're no longer hands on, yet want to portray the image that the grandkids are running around the restaurant and grandma's making meatballs. That's likely what happened here. The restaurant was only Italian in the food, but overall vibe was not that.  Great food. Great service. If anyone at Nora's who's been there for a while reads this, they'll know what I mean by \"charm\" and \"something.\"",

    "text": "The Yelp reviews enticed me to visit this place. Summary: Food was good. Service was absolutely terrible.  Very rude waitress.    My first experience, I came here with a date.  I ordered what appears to be everyone's favorite - the Crazy Alfredo.  I love Alfredo sauce. The portion served could feed two people. We ordered the Bruschetta Promodoro.  Recommended.  We moved on to the entries and finally desert.  Overall, the food was pretty good.   Unfortunately,  the waitress was very rude and provided exceptionally poor service.  If someone doesn't like their job - they really shouldn't put themselves in such situations.  From the time we arrived, the waitress appeared unfriendly.  Her demeanor left me with an impression that she was not happy 1. doing her job. 2. providing us service (personal problem of hers maybe?).  Both relatively polite individuals who didn't make any odd/uncommon requests for service.    I ignored her rudeness, since I was there to enjoy dinner with my date.  Naturally, I avoided any additional order or asking any questions about the menu options.  She made me feel so uncomfortable, I just didn't want her near our table.    On my second visit, we got the same person.  The waitress remembered me and appeared to make an effort to be friendly, initially.  Unfortunately, that was short lived.  Her presence was just negative.  You can just sense the negativity in a person - whether it is their dismissive facial gestures, or overall rude tone of voice.    Again, I have no tolerance for such people and pay no mind.  What bothered me more on this second visit is her crude remark.  Apparently, a term I used to describe what I wanted to order - rubbed her the wrong way?  She made a very rude remark that made me give her a quick look - but I smiled and moved on.  I don't come here to engage such petty people - I come here to enjoy good food with good company.  Unfortunately, this same waitress chipped away at my attempt to enjoy dinner with my date.   On my third visit (Italian is a favorite for many, and the food is good).  This time, my date insisted on visiting this place as she never had the pleasure of experiencing it herself.  So, I took a chance.  Long and behold - the SAME waitress for the third time.  No difference.  This waitress provides such poor service, I had to walk over to the bartender, order a drink and tipped him well.  He noticed the poor service being offered by the Waitress.  In fact, he even gave me a look as if he acknowledged what was going on.",

When you walk in,  you come directly to the pizza order counter,  but we were seated to the left, which was a more private area, nice for dates, possibly. Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble, etc. was playing in the background.  On to the food. You start out with a complimentary order of the garlic bread,  which was amazing! Sooo garlicky, with fresh minced garlic. We had the fried calamari, which came out quicker than expected. Microwaved? Or maybe it was just because it was slow at the time. Either way, it wasn't as crispy as I'd like, but still enjoyable.  It was served with this sauce that kinda tasted like a roasted chile salsa you'd find at a taco shop, and paired really well with the dish.  For the main dish, I had the pappardelle pasta with the wild boar and red wine ragu. Oh. My. Poop. I loved it! The meat was tender and the sauce full of flavor. I had some leftovers and was actually excited to get hungry again so I could eat the rest of it.   I'm definitely coming back to try some other dishes.",

Best dinner I've ever had in all my Vegas trips!  Which is about 10-15 times.   The service AMAZING! The food also amazing!  We enjoyed the whole time we were there!   It's so nice outside also.  It reminds me of a Olive Garden but nicer and food tasted more genuine/authentic.",

I ordered a sangria and the bf ordered an IPA. He said his tasted good & had no complaints. My sangria was pretty strong. I wish they had more fresh fruit inside but it wasn't bad. They give you a complimentary basket of garlic bread. Those were pretty tasty. I ordered the crazy Alfredo and he ordered some pasta with eggplant stuff on it. The meals itself were very good. However, it was almost an hour wait for the food. They were pretty packed so I guess it wasn't a surprise that it took a while but still... If I wasn't a little tipsy & I wasn't enjoying my bf's company, I would've been annoyed LOL. But the server was very nice!",

It's always a pleasure to see staff that have been with them for years.  The only thing we would change is more live serenades - we miss it when one of the owners sons would give us Italian serenades (these were frequent at the prior location just a little a little West of the current NEW location).     Inevitably, returning family and friends from out-of-town always request a meal at Nora's.  Tonight, we had a party of 10 and we received the most attentive and perfect service from Daniel and Jacob.   A huge thank you to the staff at Nora's for excellent service and even more amazing food!    As for the food - excellent!  The baked ziti or chicken Marsala are my personal favorites!   My husband and children could not survive a meal at a Nora's without their garlic baskets.  You can never go wrong with a meal at Nora's!!!",

Our waiter was hosting a few large parties celebrating birthdays but once the waiter did come around all was well. I had the roasted octopus app. which I really enjoyed. For dinner I had the chicken Marsala, the sauce was sweet and chicken cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the chocolate Oreo tartufo, one word delicious!

I get a very mom & pop feel to this Italian joint... but like a back in the days mobster mom & pop shop feel where they would go to get a home style cooked meal. They 2.5 different dining area.... one in the right which seems more of a romantic mood setting while then left side is more of a bright lighting family feel & the center where the open kitchen is there are a few table but I dunno if they actually seat people there. The bar area is on the right side where it seems like they also have a stage for live performance music.  The staff look very professional & also carry themselves professionally in their vested uniforms.   ANTIPASTO SALAD $15.25 - this is the large size which feeds 2-4 but I eat this as a meal usually when I do take-out. Romaine lettuce, kalamata olives, onions, mozerella cheese, Ham & salami wrapped w/provolone cheese, & Roma tomato w/ Italian dressing. I crave this salad whenever I want a salad.   18\" SHRIMP WHITE PIZZA $19.95 - white sauce pizza w/ diced pieces of shrimp, garlic, tomato, & mozzarella...  this pizza was PACKED w/flavors!! It was packed w/ little bits of garlic which was in every single bite.  GARLIC BREAD $2.50 - crispy outside but soft buttery garlicy on the other side. They give you a complimentary basket when you dine in & then additional order is $2.50 or when you do takeout.   I have tried other things here in the past before but only these items have really stood out to me...",

Our waitress took down our orders fairly quickly and other servers were constantly making rounds to fill water, which was nice. They have a live band playing on the weekends but we were seated on the other side so we couldn't really hear them.   The complimentary garlic bread was delicious! It had real minced garlic on it, not just garlic powder. It was my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the chicken marsala which comes with a side of spaghetti. The chicken was juicy and tender but the portion was actually pretty small. The side of spaghetti, which was was just OK, was bigger than the chicken.  It's not my favorite Italian restaurant but I wouldn't mind coming back again to try other dishes!",

This is one of those places where the servers would recognize you and make you feel welcomed. There are a lot of locals who frequent this restaurant and are treated like family. We ordered one of their most popular dishes, the Crazy Alfredo. The portion size is definitely crazy. You can easily share this dish with someone else. The pasta is super creamy and it comes with chicken, sausage and shrimp. I was very satisfied with this dish. However, the best part was the chocolate lava. It takes about 20 minutes to get it, but it's worth every minute. The dessert was soft, super tasty and thankfully it was not overwhelming sweet. The pistachio on top was a very nice addition to the dessert. Overall, this is a nice place if you want great food while feeling like your home.",

    "text": "I went on a date with my girlfriend here because we passed by Nora's several times and thought it looked nice from the outside. I made a reservation for 8:30 on 11/4/17 It was already a late dinner but we took it because that's the only time they had available. We got there at about 8:15 and told the hostess that we are there for our 8:30 reservation... we weren't seated until about 9:10. It was ridiculous!!! At that point we wanted to leave already because we were so aggravated with the staff and their scheduling. I tried to ask the hostess about 4 times if we are going to be seated anytime soon, she answered    \"give me a couple of seconds\" every time. Our experience started off terribly but after we got seated things went alright. We both got different types of pasta and it was pretty good. But when I got close to the bottom of my plate there was so much oil I had never seen that much oil in a plate before, It was pretty gross. Safe to say I will never go back to this place again.",

This small, cozy, romantic, Italian restaurant is definitely one to put on your list to eat at. I was shocked of the lay out as it just didn't have the feel of a fine dinning restaurant I mean it felt like I walked into the kitchen of mobsters house! When you first walk in The front counter covers the open bar kitchen with a few seats then seemingly in a whole other room there is dining. Its weird but cozy!  The waiter we had did OK, I mean I have had better service I think he was new not sure but he got the job done!   On to the menu. Wow what a full menu with so many options to choose from! I went with there super Alfredo plate and let me tell you it was delicious. The sauce was creamy and full of flavor and the fixing in the Alfredo was like a pizza! It had everything in there and was a great mix too. I was a little concerned at first since I mean seriously was a combination pizza with noodles!! The plate was huge and was not limited on the goods inside. I barley could finish it but I couldnt stop eating!!  When it comes to Italian food this is a must try place. It will bring you the feel of a mobster paradise and fill your belly like your the Don!",

No real parmesan cheese, but rather the cheap stuff you get at Pizza Hut. Waiter will suggest a salad, but does not tell you it is extra.   For $52 I expect a better dining experience.",

Waiter rarely around, other server brought wrong course to our table, no apology a third random server over head my complaint as I was asking for our server to fix the issue and brought us the same salad with additional toppings.  A bus boy dropped plates and drinks where liquid got on me, waiter laughed it off and only checked on me as after thought. Pasta not home made and I am skeptical about the sauces.

    "text": "I didn't see my MIL and GIL on my birthday so they wanted to take me out to a belated birthday dinner. I have had this bookmarked for quite a while.   We were given a basket of garlic bread while we wait for our order. MM! I am a garlic freak so I was taking the garlic off everyone else's slices since they like it light on garlic. You can also request plain toasted if you don't do garlic.   The BF had cheese ravioli w/ alfredo- the raviolis are fresh made in house and were very good (I took a bite of course, tee hee) and the sauce was thick and had good flavor.   Mom had the lasagna- she's been wanted lasagna for weeks and she was very happy with it here. It had little sausage bites in it instead of just meat sauce and cheese. She's a light eater normally, but she tore into that!   Grandma had spaghetti and meatballs- she liked the meatballs here a lot and they did look quite good.   I had the chicken mt etna- it wasn't bad, but I think I ordered the wrong thing. The individual components were good- chicken with peppers and cheese and balsamic together was nice and chicken was juicy, the onion strings were crisp and the seasoning was great, roasted potatoes good. There was angel hair that was crisp to like a uncooked top ramen consistency which is a bit odd and between all these layers was a bit much. I ate the onion strings and some of the chicken. I can see some people really liking this type of stuff (I ordered it based on the Yelp summary on top of it being mentioned in reviews), but to me it's the classics here that are standouts and can't steer wrong with a solid plate of pasta.  I ended up asking for a side of linguini with vodka sauce. I'm so glad I did because it really changed my dinner. The sauce was superb and close to the vodka sauce at my favorite Italian place in LA I've been going to since I was a kid. I got my bread and wiped that bowl clean! The BF tried some and he is now saying we are going back for some of that!   The quality, taste,portion to price ratio is fantastic here. Most pasta dishes were around $9-11 with specialties in the $14-20 range with a few meat specialties from $22-30. That's like Olive Garden prices and leaps better. Very reasonable compared to a lot of other Italian places in town. $60 +tip for 5 dishes and drinks is not bad at all!   Our server was very attentive, personable and polite throughout. He kept checking in without being obtrusive to dinner conversation, filled drinks half full, had good pacing for boxes and check that we didn't wait for any need. We ended up chatting with him and he's actually a busser who they sometimes let serve. Casey should be a server as that's some seriously great service!  Way better than some of these seasoned jokes around town. He gave me a tiramisu even to top off the  birthday dinner (for those curious- pretty good, heavy on the coffee notes so a dessert for those who love their coffee).   Despite what I ordered originally, this place is great for the classics and service is great. Definitely coming back and sad I haven't tried it sooner.",

I usually get  the gnocchi with vodka sauce which is my favorite. The Ossobuco here is also amazing and I highly recommend it.    The service here has always been great even on the busier nights i've been there. The also do take out orders which is awesome when I want great Italian food after work.

    "text": "I swear, people have the most disgusting palates in Vegas.  I ordered the \"Crazy\" Alfredo (advertised as a \"favorite\").  Crazy is right.  Expired chicken, overcooked rubbery shrimp, and it all tasted like it was cooked the previous week, stored, and microwaved for service. My wife ordered spaghetti with meat sauce.  How can you screw that up?  I don't know how you can, but Nora's did.  The sauce was watery and the meat chunks so small it can literally be drunk and not chewed.  Seriously, my wife almost went across the street to Smiths to pick up a bottle of Progresso to put on hers.  I tried this place once about a year ago and figured I'd give it one more chance.  Never again.  This place seriously needs Gordon Ramsay to do his Kitchen Nightmares show.  It screams outdated, lack of standards, and absolutely disgusting food.  There was one semi-redeeming quality - the store bought bread they served was loaded with roasted garlic.  That was pretty decent.",

My bro loves the Pasta ala Nora and the Orange Roughy dish.  My dad ordered the Chicken Marsala and he enjoyed it.  We also ordered the Antipasto salad which was yummy, with lots of fresh meat on it.   The service was very good...they were very attentive. From what I understand they used to be smaller and then when they were featured on some show and got more popular they had to add on an extra room to accomodate all their new customers.   I seriously felt like there was a little old Italian lady that cooked our meals for us...so yummy:)  Make sure to make reservations...we went on a Tuesday, made reservations, and we still had to wait a bit!  Oh, and it's located in a shopping center, behind an Arby's!",

The food was delicious as well - for an appetizer, we ordered the bruschetta, which was light and very well done. For the entree, I ordered the Alla Nora and my boyfriend ordered, what I'm assuming was the special for the night as I do not see it on the menu.  The Alla Nora was a wonderful combination of eggplant, cheese, and pasta, baked and topped with herbs. I remember his dish as an amazing pasta dish that had a good amount of vegetables, but what stuck out was the gargonzola that was mixed into the dish and was blended into the sauce.  I had expected this to be too cheesy and creamy, but it was just right.  And how can we not top of an Italian meal with a dessert of Cannoli?  Not only was the presentation beautifully done, but it was delicious.    Price-wise, the restaurant was very reasonably priced and I'm sure I'll be going again in the near future.",

    "text": "Before last night I would have always given Nora's a 5 star!  Last night something went terribly wrong.  I will go back again with the expectation that it was a BAD night.  I have been going for years.  I ALWAYS got the Baked Ziti until the past year I discovered the Crazy Alfredo.  If I'm going to splurge and have pasta, this is the dish I usually want.  But deciding between the two can be difficult.  Not anymore.  Last night I felt like red sauce so ordered the ziti which I just had in early Jan and they hadn't done THIS to it.  It's $13.95 and they reduced it to about a 1/3 the size.  I think I could have counted the number of macaroni in the (no more than) 3/4 in shallow dish about 5 inches in diameter.  Whaaaaaaaaaat are you doing?!  My companion order the Crazy Alfredo and it looked to be the usual dish/portion.  And he loved it!  You could always count on Nora's to be consistent in the past.  You never had to worry about what you would get but last night was far from the usual.  My ziti was always piping when it hit the table.  Last night I could eat it straight away.  We actually waited quite a while for our food.  After I got mine, I think it was because it had been sitting up on the line for awhile or they found some from the lunch hour to re-heat.  (A side note, Nora's, I was a little perturbed that after I told the busboy twice to leave the remaining bread on the table, that at some point while I was in conversation he came by the table and picked it up.  Trust me that you need to reiterate to your bus staff not to clear a table without ASKING the diner first.)  I will go back for the Crazy Alfredo (until they change that) and my second is now my first rated for Baked Ziti which really sucks because I love the mounds of ricotta on the top.  A highlight for me.  Please fix this situation so I can update my review!",

The food is good in that carb laden, dripping in cheese and sauce way that is absolutely yummy to eat, but requires a double trip to the gym the next day to work off the guilt. Additionally, the portions are large so the overindulgence brings on the required nap afterward. One of the best lemon drop martinis in a long while, however my pizza was very good in flavor, but too heavy in crust and cheese-almost dripping-and while i favor a thicker crust-it was almost like eating a loaf of bread which was too much for my taste. Prices are right, service is prompt, taste is good, just will keep this for a very very occasional if the goal is to eat a bit lighter.",

If you ARE there by 5pm, you can enjoy being somewhat screwed by waiting patrons rubbing their chest against your back while you are sitting at the bar, who are also being rubbed inappopriately by the patrons behind them. My party of three and I shared the gnocchi with pesto and the cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. It was ridiculously delicious, since pasta has a tendency to be boring. The house salad was hardly boring and the desserts (yay for my birthday) should be declared illegal by the FDA for being capable of jump-starting a myocardial infarction. We tasted the tiramisu and the chocolate molten cake... I am not a dessert person but these were worth trying. Save your mothers from preying on the waiters/barstaff like starved cougars and leave them at home.",

We shared a Caesar salad that was on the small side though the menu indicated it would serve 2-3.  The salad itself was decent, but the croutons were soft and flavorless.  The menu was the same as you would find in any Italian/American restaurant so my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan while I chose meatballs and spaghetti.  Both dishes were satisfactory though typically over sauced and below expectations.",

Food: I got the crazy alfredo which was pretty good. I liked the elements entailed to it such as the Jalepeno for an extra kick, bell peppers for texture and a hint of sweetness and sausage for a heightened flavor. Still, it wasn't anything impressive that would amount to a total of $20 something per plate. My girlfriend got the pasta with meat sauce but wasn't impressive as her dish mostly had cheese. Quite disappointing to say the least. At the end of the meal, we received a complimentary dessert in celebration of my birthday which was one of the most exceptional tiramisu I've ever tasted.   Service: it was okay. Nothing outstanding but for the type of restaurant they were, I expected a little bit more attention. Our server wasn't at all enthusiastic and made it seem like we were just another customer. Quite disappointing.   Ambiance: beautiful venue as this is their new location. I really felt like this restaurant belonged in summerlin or even the Strip. It was modern with a dash of classic.   Overall: I mean, I wouldn't be in a hurry to visit again. If you're a huge fan of Italian, I do suggest to give them a try but I wasn't too impressed.",

The steak and arugala bruschetta, boneless rib eye, fetuccini carbonara and veal were superb! Portions wete large enough to take home. My only disappointment was this morning I chewed on a few egg shells in my carbonara left overs. Hey, it happens. Will still return. Please note MAKE A RESERVATION. Luckily my husband did, despite it being a Monday night it was packed and there was a wait.",

    "text": "Loved our experience! I made a reservation via opentable for my Fiance's birthday and it was fantastic. We came earlier than our reservation time since I read about some reviews regarding possible wait time. This definitely worked out in our favor since we were seated earlier than expected (thanks Jules!). Our server (Laura? I believe was her name), as well as the rest of the team (bussers and bev. servers) were on point when it came to our drinks being refilled, waiting on food, and removing finished dishes. We were given a table that was away from the crowd and loud noises which gave us more privacy. We'll definitely try the other side of the restaurant next time! As for the food, I loved their bread basket, perfectly seasoned and buttered. My fiance ate his entire dish of wild boar pasta dish (forgot the name), and my linguini with Manila clams was amazing (the dish was a perfect balance of seasoning and clams!). For our dessert, she brought over a complimentary birthday dessert. I didn't know it was going to be a Tiramisu (which I ended up eating because he doesn't like coffee), and we ordered the oreo ice cream dessert to go. Both of them were just the right amount of sweetness to end a great birthday for my boo.  Tipped more than 20% for a job well done, [side note: REMEMBER TO ALWAYS TIP YOUR SERVER(S)]. Thank you!",

I do like that they still give you a look at the kitchen rather than putting it begins closed doors.  The place was very busy on our last visit. The host and waiter were very apologetic for the wait. The funny thing is, there was no wait. I think maybe they felt like they weren't getting to us quickly enough because they were so busy, but that wasn't the case at all.   We will definitely return as it is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "Nora's is one of those places that is consistently good but somehow never on my radar unless I'm driving by- usually right after eating somewhere else. Luckily, a coworker insisted on dinner here so I finally got a chance to visit since their relocation, which puts their great food and attentive service (especially from Don!) in a suitably beautiful setting.  Started with a round of house salads, fresh with a great house dressing, plus their house garlic bread I raved about on my initial visit (spoiler alert: it's still amazing!). Tried the decadent carbonara, which I'll definitely be back for, but ultimately opted for my old standby, the Alla Nora (baked spaghetti topped with eggplant, meat sauce, and pesto) and was not disappointed. Kicked it up with a third course of chicken marsala and lamb shank, which was a huge, beautiful portion, perfectly cooked.  Might as well go big and have dessert after all that; the panna cotta topped with fresh berries was just sweet enough. I have no idea what witchcraft keeps me from thinking of Nora's when I want old-school carbs, but I'll be making a concentrated effort to visit more often.  NOTE: They seem even busier since moving, if that's even possible, and by 6PM on a weeknight there was a serious wait list. Reservations recommended, or snag a spot at the bar!",

Its cozy - and not too big, but also has accommodations for small gatherings or private dining as well as large dinners. I saw what appeared to be a private dining room and a large one - I was impressed. The service was excellent, so was the food. We were immediately given the warm garlic bread. O-M-G there is one word that comes to mind delicious ( with a capital D). We got the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer - loved it! The marinara that came with it was definitely tasty. The entrees we decided upon were Spaghetti lunch, the veal manicotti, the eggplant parmesan, and special rigatoni. For dessert we devoured the tiramisu and cannoli.",

    "text": "Go where the locals dine! And Nora's is where the locals dine...and in droves!!!  Nora's is a legit restaurant that has been serving huge plates of tasty pasta since 1991 ( that's a long time in Vegas land).   They have moved from their original strip mall location to a much larger free standing building. The new location is gorgeous with lovely wood floors , modern light fixtures, outside dinning ( at 105 degrees we opted out of that!), a very lovely large bar.  We did not have reservations and had to wait an hour...but it was worth it. My tip to you on this is to come in after the first rush around 7 and it should be less hectic.  Great appetizers: free garlic bread, wonderful done calamari, mozzarella sticks, a very solid Cesar salad ( somewhat pedestrian but okay).  The menu has something for everyone: great gnocchi, fantastic lasagna ( layered with light al dente  pasta, bechamel cream,  tomato sauce and rich cheese), hearty wild boar  pappardelle, lovely linguini with either shrimp scampi or salmon.....even their classic cheese pizza is pretty darn good.  The meat and fish dishes also looked fantastic although we did not partake.  Nice and extensive wine list ( nothing crazy but good solid pics). Two of us had a Chianti Classico and it was okay not great!  Service was impeccable: polite, efficient, and consistent. All used utensils were replaced with new. Water was filled consistently fast. Waiters checked back frequently to see how things were....and these guys are working lots of busy tables!!!!  Desserts looked great but we were too full.  I highly recommend Nora's for 2-10 people and feel you will have  a wonderful experience away from the strip.  Expect to pay $30 for an appetizer, a pasta dish and maybe a glass of wine....and for me from San Francisco that's a deal!",

I get it, you weren't treated like a superstar as you may have been before they moved, but you even acknowledged how great the food was, that the bartender was fantastic and even comped a round for you, but still give them 2 stars - napkins in the rest room weren't folded as they used to be, seriously, stop being such a snob you're at a busy restaurant with absolutely delicious food for very reasonable prices, best restaurant this side of the strip and finding stupid reasons to mark it down.  Sorry, I don't usually react this way, but this restaurant is my new favorite - moved here in January and have looked around for good food at reasonable prices and this is the one.  They get large parties all of the time and are swamped, all of the time.  So some of the waiters stand at the front, any good restaurant does that so they can overlook all of their tables to see if anyone is looking for help.  Apparently, you got a table that was busier than most, your waiter may have been waiting on one of the large tables and hadn't made their way out to you yet.  If you really think this is a two star restaurant then you definitely won't want to go back their again.  But...if you find yourself back there soon then you should update your review because you know their restaurant is so much better than any others in this area.  I know they're busy, I've waited for my food and service as well, but I'm out to dinner so I realize that's always a possibility.  Rather than having a restaurant that treats its customers like cattle and moves them in and out quickly, here you just sit back and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere and stop all of the phony pretentious attitude - missing a certain je ne sais quoi, come on, you're not at an upscale restaurant that charges a hundred + bill for a spaghetti dinner, if you were they'd have waiters tripping over each other!  Cheesecake Factory, seriously, I've eaten there twice and both times the food wasn't great and the service was ten times crazier then Nora's.  I dare you not to eat here anymore, we'll see how long you last before you try them again!",

    "text": "Since my boyfriend and I moved to Vegas we've been in search of a good, decently priced Italian restaurant. After seeing all the amazing reviews for Nora's we decided to give it a shot. We really wanted to like it. But our search continues. We got there and immediately decided we should have scheduled a reservation. We waited almost an hour for a table, which we expected. I'm not complaining about this, it's just a fact. We got our table and ordered our food. And barely saw our server after that. Which would have been fine if the food had been as as good as we were expecting it to be, especially for the price. The complimentary garlic bread we got was okay, but it tasted a lot like the Texas Toast you buy in the freezer section at the grocery store.. My boyfriend ordered the Spaghetti with meatballs and I ordered the Chicken Alfredo. The spaghetti was pretty bland and tasted exactly like the can of Chef Boyardee we all ate as children. The Alfredo would have been okay but there was so much olive oil pooled at the bottom of the dish that it was hard to stomach.  As I said, we really wanted to like it, and if you like it that's great. But personally, I would never eat there again.",

I love the Crazy Alfred the best.  If you are in Vegas and want Italian you can not go wrong here.",

The spaghetti arrived in a puddle of water and overall, was tasteless.  I was not impressed; I can make better spaghetti. The waiter came across as arrogant, and was not very interested in customer service. Nora's has a good reputation in LV, but will lose it at this rate. Dinner staff is better.",

    "text": "I was excited to try out this place reading all the great reviews but we left kinda feeling like we overpaid for what we got. We came with the 3 kids 2 in highchairs and they seemed pretty family friendly. But I felt they seated us right in the middle of the bar area and with kids there just wasn't much wiggle room and felt out of place with singles and older couples drinking at the bar and trying to enjoy their night out. They did have an entire other side of the restaurant which would've been a better option to seat a party with kids.   As for the food it's was meh. My hubby loves Alfredo so he got the crazy Alfredo which he did eat it all but said there was too much going on with mostly sausage and peppers. I got the lasagna and we didn't finish it, and a white pizza which definitely lacked flavor, it was just crust, spinach, cheese, no fresh herbs or drizzle of olive oil which is common at other pizzerias on their white pizzas. The garlic bread had a ton of garlic, kids didn't like it but hey I like garlic so it was ok. Service was ok nothing worth noting just kinda blah. I also saw 2 other tables that sent food back, not sure if it was the flavor or just the wrong order. So yea I could say it's worth a try on date night but I would stick with OG which might have even been cheaper too.",

My mother had a peach bellini which was AWESOME as well!   Everything we had for dinner was great-the steak and arugula bruschetta was great, thinly sliced steak on top of toasted garlic bread. For our entrees we had Frutti Di Mare in a spicy red sauce, veal parm, and a chicken dish similar to piccata with artichokes and capers. Everything was fantastic!   The service was great, especially the server assistant who helped me decide on a dish (the chicken carciofi-sp?) and it was delicious without being too overwhelming or heavy, thank you!!!",

Atmosphere is nice enough for date night, but not too formal, where you have to get dressy or feel like you are going to break the bank.  Service was very friendly, and attentive...couldn't have asked for a better server.  Went with a good bottle of wine that the waitress recommended as well...win!  On to the food!  Garlic bread is good...very garlicy garlic bread lol.  It was good, but not mind blowing like some have said.  But good garlic bread nonetheless.  Started with the shrimp scampi...very good...wish the shrimp was seared a little more, but very tender and  the sauce was yum.  This was more expensive than both of the entress lol.  We went with the lasagna and the ziti...not only were they the best I have had, but they were both about $10 a plate!  Not even Olive Garden is that cheap...and OG is like Mcdonalds compared to the taste explosion that is Noras.  I don't know what they put in this food at Noras, but I am still thinking about it days later.  Portions were generous as well.    And lastly, tiramisu for dessert....very good.  Seems like you can't go wrong here.  I am actually looking forward to visiting again...I'd like to try some more of their seafood options!  If you are craving Italian, don't burn 3 times the amount of money anywhere near the strip...it is worth the drive or cab fare...believe it.",

I went for lunch with my boyfriend & after hearing such great reviews on the place we were excited to try it. Our waiter was very friendly & made some recommendations. We started off with the pork belly appetizer & he ordered the crazy alfredo & i the chicken piccata. We waited what seemed like a long time for the pork belly, then our server let us know the kitchen had messed up on it & was remaking it. When it came out, it was good though. Then we the food runner gave us our plates, my boyfriend had visual mushrooms in his dish, after he had specifically asked for no mushrooms to be on there. My dish was not even the one I ordered. The woman apologized & took them both back. When she returned everything was right. Our server asked what went wrong, but didn't seem to apologetic. Both dishes were delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more. My boyfriend agreed. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because 3 out of 3 dishes needed to be remade & nothing was taken off the bill. If even just a glass of wine or our appetizer was taken off it would have made it obvious that they valued our time and our satisfaction & wanted to ensure we came back. A place like Nora's seems like they would care about guests return",

I called today, March 30, to see if I could change the time. I was told by the snarky hostess that I did not have a reservation. I was also told that I made it for a different day even though I have the email record of my reservation. I hung up to check my email, called the restaurant back, and got the manager. He found the reservation with no problem and confirmed that the time could not be changed. At this point I was a bit put out by the hostess's attitude and we decided to go somewhere else. I called back to cancel the reservation and got to talk to Miss Snarky once again. She was just as snarky as she was before but even more so. Should couldn't find the reservation once again, but finally did using my last name (she never asked me my last name when I called the first time). I thanked her very forcefully for her excellent customer service. Needless to say, you have lost our business for good now.",

    "text": "My boyfriend found this place on Yelp - we were looking for places a little further from the strip and less touristy. (Even though we ourselves were tourists, go figure!)   Made reservations and got there early so we could check out the bar for a pre-dinner martini.    The stoli lemon drop martini I got was in the top 5 lemon drops I have ever had (and this is coming from someone who has spent thirty minutes making a 'perfect' lemon drop martini for myself on more than one occasion).   The lemon slice they had in there was actually candied/seared  and I think that (along with the freshly hand-squeezed lemon juice) is what made it so delicious.   So they'd already won me over before we even got to our table.    The bartenders were courteous and prompt and humored us by taking our photo (twice because I looked fat in the first one haha).  For starters we ordered the calamari appetizer and caesar salad.  They also brought us a complimentary basket of garlic bread - which was delicious!  Lots of butter so it's gooey in the middle and crispy on the edges, just how i love it.   The salad was good solid standard caesar - nothing over the top or unique but very enjoyable.  It also came with more of the yummy garlic bread cut into crouton sized pieces on top - bonus!  The calamari was good - nice and crisp, not too greasy, and was a generous portion.  The dipping sauce they served with it (a caper infused marinara according to our server) is what makes this dish stand out.  It was NOM.    The wine selection was also pretty nice and the server did a great job of recommending pairings. We ended up with the La Giaretta Cab Franc which paired very well as it was able to hold up to the bold italian flavors we were eating.  Entrees:  I got the crazy alfredo, and it was as delicious as the portion was huge.  If you're a shrimp lover you may want to ask for extra shrimp because my serving only came with two.  That didn't bother me though because I feel like the sausage and sun dried tomatoes were the True stars of that dish and I actually felt like the shrimp didn't need to be there. (Borderline sacrilege but True!)   The sauce seems like  an alfredo with some marsala sauce mixed in... lending it a beautiful golden color and sending the flavor through the roof.     I highly recommend this dish.   The boyfriend wasn't as pleased with his, unfortunately.  The server told us the special was veal chop parmesan but we only heard 'veal chop' and envisioned something a little more pure and refined... so when we got a breaded cut of veal covered in red sauce and cheese we were a little disappointed.  Miscommunication aside, it was \"good\" and enjoyable but not great or anything to write home about.  I don't know about anyone else, but for me veal is such a rare, guilty pleasure that when I do eat it, I expect it to be damn good and also expect the chefs preparing it to treat it with due respect.  Unfortunately I don't feel this did justice to it.    Boyfriend says he was also shocked to see that the veal chop was $34 when we got the bill.  Completely out of line with the prices of the standard entrees printed in the menu which range from $9 to $22.   Service during the dinner had its highs and lows.  Our server for the most part was friendly, nice, easy to talk to, and gave great wine and desert wine pairing recommendations.   There was a rather long delay between our salad course and entree course.  The server explained there was some confusion in the kitchen.... yada yada he apologized and told us he'd be happy to give us a free dessert.   We were fine with that, not a huge deal as we had eaten something already and were enjoying the wine and the music.   But then there was the awkward moment (as I'm browsing the dessert menu looking at wines) when he snatched the menu out of my hand and set a piece of cheesecake in front of me telling me he'll save me the trouble, this is the best dessert they have.  This made me feel a little awkward as though he thought I was trying to take advantage of the situation and order something super expensive or something, which I wasn't.   Well, neither of us usually eat dessert so we accepted the cheesecake with thanks but without much enthusiasm and proceeded to get the menu back so we could order some dessert wine.  The wine he recommended me (to pair with the cheesecake) did in fact pair so well with the cheesecake that I ended up eating almost the entire piece, of which I had initially planned to take a few polite bites and leave it at that.      So all in all, despite the few hiccups, it was a very pleasant experience.  We had a great time and came away satisfied.  Our entrees were huge enough for us to share AND take home an abundance of left overs.   We'll be back next time we're in Vegas for sure and will definitely recommend to our friends.",

The atmosphere is still great even if the neighborhood isn't all that nice.   The food is pretty good. Not the most fantastic stuff I've ever had, but I've enjoyed every dish I've had there. It's definitely better than Fiamma in MGM and about half the price. Vodka penne has been my favorite so far.   What really stands out are the cocktails. They have some interesting house cocktails on the menu that were really delicious. I have a decent knowledge of liquors thanks to my cocktail-enthusiast husband, but Nora's had a few things I've never heard of that were fun to try. I loved their Pimm's Cup --so refreshing during summer in the desert.  I just realized I've never had dessert here. Gotta go back on my next visit!",

    "text": "I've been to Nora's years ago and it was ok, but my dining experience last night was perhaps the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time.   Quick note about the ambiance. This location has WAAAAY too many tables crammed in. It's not intimate at all. It was loud and crowded. I had to shout to speak across the small table. This was an immediate turn off to me. They've clearly packed in as many tables as possible to maximize the number of guests that they can seat, however, the sacrifice is poor service and poor atmosphere.  Yesterday was my wife's birthday and we made reservations at 6:30pm. Her parents and her arrived at the restaurant on time and I arrived about 25 minutes later. They had already placed their order and there were some appetizers on the table when I got there. I have to say that the salad dressing had way too much vinegar in it for my taste. The calamari was good. The waiter came by to take my order. I ordered the rib-eye steak medium-well and substituted the fries for veggies. Nearly an hour later my steak comes out burnt to a crisp. I took one bite and flagged the waiter down to tell him that it was not edible. He takes it back and tells me that that's how they make a medium-well steak. I told him..\"ok..make it medium-rare because I don't want a burnt piece of meat.\" I wait another 30 minutes for a new steak to come out. This replacement was much better but still burnt around the edges. It was odd to me because it had even thickness all around but the outside ring was way more done (brown) than the center (bleeding). I'm thinking perhaps this was frozen and not properly thawed prior to being cooked. So I ate the $30 steak and was not very impressed because it had almost no taste and I was not offered any sauce to compliment it. Also, the \"veggies\" that I got were literally a small cup with some poor excuse for broccoli, sauteed tomatoes, and mushrooms. At this point my wife and her parents have been done with their food and it's already in boxes. They ordered a couple of pasta dishes and they seemed pleased with the food but did not rave about it. We decide to get a couple desserts (canolli and cheesecake) and a couple of cappuccinos. The cappuccinos came out in about 5 minutes alone. We didn't want them to get cold, so we drank them. The cappuccinos were actually VERY good. I'm sure they have a fancy espresso machine in the back. Then about 15 minutes later the desserts came out. While they tasted good, it would've been a much better experience if I would've gotten my cappuccino with my dessert. Overall I was EXTREMELY disappointed with entire dining experience. My family and I will be avoiding Nora's in the future as a result of this experience. In Las Vegas there is so much competition for Italian food and this experience really turned me off to this place.  Edited to add that I would've liked it if the manager on duty would've stopped by to ask about our service because I would've given them an earful. My wife was against me going to find the manager myself to give feedback because it was her birthday dinner and she just wanted to leave.",

I dare say that of all the local restaurants in town, this received the highest amount of locals. Othe rplaces in town are starting to attract tourists, but here it is guaranteed that 99% of the clientele is local. I like that. You can sit at the bar and have an amazing cocktail and chat up some of the regulars. When I go I usually order the clover club. They really have an amazing cocktail program, I highly suggesthaving a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar. The only thing I dislike is tha they have tv's at the bar, but othe rthan that a good time is guaranteed. Plus  in the evenings they have live music, which is nice.  I recommend coming here for a leisurely dinner. You start off the meal with a basket of garlic bread, super garlicky and super good. The calamari and arancini are both excellent appetizers. All os the pastas here are great. I have tried most of them, the pesto, primavera, lasagna, etc. My favorite is the pasta alla nora, which is pasta baked with an eggplant, pesto and meat sauce. OMG it is delish! I he tried their pizza once and I wasn't convinced. Stick to pastas and you will be happy.  No dinner here is complete without cannoli. I recommed you order it with pistachios only, rather than the chocolate chips which are not very good.   Oh, bonus if you check in on Yelp. You get a free glass of the house wine. Score!",

    "text": "Dined at Nora's tonight, recently moved within a few blocks of it. I knew it was popular so a few minutes wait for a seat at the bar didn't bother me. I was dining alone, Michelle was pleasant and attentive. Had two glasses of a Sauvignon Blanc which I felt was just about right for portion size and price. My (smaller) size Caesar Salad could have been a little bigger, and I like larger croutons than what they serve. However the extra taste of anchovy in the dressing was a welcomed treat. Too many Italian restaurants these days seem apprehensive to add a little of the salty goodness. The initial basket of garlic bread was too soft, and more of a \"butter sponge,\" would have preferred some crispiness in it. I ordered the Linguini with white clams. Michelle paced the meal just right, it was served very hot, thank you! Pasta was a perfect al dente, sauce was very enjoyable with a nice balance of garlic, herbs, and butter. I requested a few slices of an alternate bread to finish the bottom of my bowl. A nice hot french style bread was brought and I preferred it way over the first serving. Did not partake of dessert, I rarely do after an Italian meal.    So glad to have this kind of quality restaurant in my neighborhood, don't have to drive, and park, at the Strip for a great meal. Plus I appreciate the neighborhood prices. Very lively atmosphere! Happy people all around and music at the right volume. I'll be back!",

    "text": "OK, so I have this little problem: When I go to Nora's I obsess over the last meal and ALWAYS end up here AGAIN within 2-3 days for another round!  We bring out-of-town guests here and they love the ambiance and the food.  We always sit in the bar area and I never get a bad look when I'm there in jeans and sweatshirt (yes, sometimes when your tummy is yelling for Nora's you just go!)  Our favorites: 1. Antipasto Salad *Romaine lettuce, mozzarella, pepperoncini, olives, onions, tomatoes, topped with ham, provolone, and salame, in our homemade Italian dressing. -FOR REALLLLL.  Little pinwheels of meat and chesse?!  OMG-YUM! 2. Caesar Salad *Romaine Lettuce, topped with Italian croutons and Nora's own Caesar's dressing. -Just tastes better than your normal Caesar.  My husband swears by this one! 3. Cheese Ravioli w/ Vodka Sauce *Might sound plain, but this is the only entree I've ever gotten and its DELICIOUS! 4. Penne w/ Arrabiata sauce & sausage. *Husband LOVES this one.  The arrabiata sauce is fabulous- not too spicy, but more flavor then your regular red sauce.  They make their sausage in-house!  I'm hoping to one day venture out of the \"ravioli box\" and try one their pizza's or maybe some seafood?  But I love what get every time, that it's so hard to try something different!  They bring out yummy garlic bread (on the house) but the next round is $1.50.  NOTE: Make reservations on SATURDAY!!!  They get crazy busy, even at 5:00pm!  They have GREAT takeout (especially for lunch!)",

    "text": "I am amazed that this little gem is in Las Vegas! We have come a long way from the typical, run of the mill, chain food restaurant. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, well lit and excellent for a private event, a date or a nice night out with friends or family. The exposed brick is breathtaking.We were seated right away. The waiter was very friendly and took special care to provide the most excellent service we have had in years.y husband and I agreed that of all the places we have tried in our four years of marriage, he was one of the two waiters that provided the most excellent customer service. Our busboy was also very friendly and between the both of them, our drinks were never empty and our plates were promptly provided. We ordered the calamari, which our waiter recommended we have with a spicy sauce..delicious. The kitchen worked hard to get our meal out fast, so fast in fact that it was pipping  hot when we received it. You can tell it was not just sitting around waiting on someone to notice it was ready like at most restaurants. The shrimp melrose was fragrant, creamy and perfectly cooked. A little in the more oily side with the pesto but I loved it! The spaghetti with meatballs my daughter ordered were delicious and my husbands fettuccine alfredo was so creamy and tasty! I highly recommend this place. All in all, with our appetizer, three meals, a few drinks and a to die for cheesecake, we spent about $100.00 not bad for a three course meal for three. We will certainly be back.",

    "text": "I was there with my wife and a few friends on Saturday 4/22  Reservation was for 4:30pm and we were promptly seated by the very nice host. My first impression: The restaurant's decorative was warm and inviting. Just beautiful! After the \"free\" garlic bread, we ordered drinks and Cesare salad for everyone (5 adults). The salad was excellent. The garlic bread was so and so. I then ordered the veal chop with spaghetti on the side. My wife, the Crazy shrimp Alfredo. A pepperoni pizza for the kids(2). But anyway, I think, no, I am sure, this Italian restaurant is over-rated! My veal chop was super salty and I mean \"salty\" and so was my wife's Alfredo. These dinners aren't inexpensive by any means and they totally blew it. There was nothing special about this place, except for the nice looking layouts and nice atmosphere. I am not going to speak for my friends here. Oh well, maybe we were paying for just \"being there\". My friends told me to let the host know of my disappointment. But, nahhh!!! I just won't be back, even for free. 2 Stars are generous! But 5 Stars for the nice looking restaurant! Just for your info., I've been to a lot of nice Italian restaurants here in Vegas and elsewhere. So, I am no stranger to Italian foods. But this place was just...very average at best and way below average if you factor in their prices.",

Get your electrician to put a dimmer on the overhead lighting in the room w/the bar. It's too bright for the amazing atmosphere you have created. Really enjoy Nora's and wouldn't change a thing on their menu. It is always an enjoyable evening with friends. Will you bring back the live music?",

    "text": "We have been eating at Nora's since we moved to Las Vegas in 2005.  The old location was very cozy feeling.  The new location (just a few blocks away) is a more modern, trendy type place.  Our first visit to the new location was disappointing.  The noise level was just awful.  It was impossible to carry on a conversation.  They have since added things to muffle the noise and it's much better.  I think they still need to work on that, but it's better. As for the food.....Back in 2005 I tried Chicken Erbe Fini....(not sure of the spelling).  It's chicken, cooked in a ton of garlic and it was served in a bowl with their spaghetti.  I'm not a huge fan of chicken, but this was delicious.  At some point it was taken off the menu and I was now going to have to find something else to eat.  The server told me that I could still order it, the chef would still make it.   Last night we had dinner there with family and when I ordered my Chicken, the server said....ahhh, you must have been coming here for a while......it's been off the menu for at least 4 years.....not to worry.....we will still make it for you...and I was a happy diner!!! Thinking back over the years, whenever we have out of town company, we ALWAYS take them to Nora's.....and some of our friends ask if we can go there again when they come for another visit.  I can also say that of all the different people and food choices, we have NEVER had a bad meal.   I do have one little issue.  We had dinner there last night.  We always order the small house salad, no onions to share.  The lettuce last night tasted and even looked different.  It was much thicker and had a little different taste than the usual Romaine lettuce.  Our server checked and they said it was the same.....I don't know about that.    We all just wish we had more self-control when that darned garlic bread comes to the table.....YUM!",

The prices are reasonable and I find the location quirky and interesting.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about them moving to a new location.  I'd also be lying however if I said I wasn't going to still patronize them.  They have a customer for life in me.

Tho it's a very nice atmosphere for dining with friends family or couples! Good service wonderful food I will say. Really love the lemon calms, almost the best I ever had, also pasta are yummy!! Only one thing is I don't think I really enjoy the entree of Italian restaurant, not only this one but most of the Italian I have been to... seems they just not really know how to cook steak... anyway definitely a to go place for me when I m craving Italian food. Make sure u make reservation as they are always packed.",

This place reminds you of your favorite local spot - a great diversion from the strip.  It's well decorated and the right side of the restaurant has an impressive bar and even live music.     Service was very efficient.  Everything was great, from ordering, getting our food, checking on us to having left overs boxed up.    The food is wonderful.  During two separate visits, we've tried the Veal Chop Parmesan, Shrimp Scampi, Rigatoni Gorgonzola with Chicken and Baked Rigatoni - all portions were large and every dish was outstanding. The only small nit was that while the Shrimp were tasty and perfectly cooked, the sauce seemed to be missing something.    We will definitely return the next time we visit Las Vegas.",

Unfortunately for us, they made us wait for a bigger table because Rachel brought her son. I didn't think that it was necessary to make a reservation for 5 people because he's a toddler and sits in a high chair, but whatevs. We had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to be seated because of this, so by the time we sat down I was hangry.   Our server was nice, but service was slow the whole time. We ordered drinks and then ordered our food. We didn't receive appetizers, salads or bread for *at least* 30 minutes. The bread was good, super garlicky and buttery. The salad was yummy, and I enjoyed the house Italian that came on top. Finally after what seemed like forever, our main courses came. I had the chicken parmesan with spaghetti alfredo, and my boyfriend had the baked rigatoni special and a side of meatballs. The baked rigatoni and the rigatoni special are separate entrees. The rigatoni special has meat and the baked rigatoni does not, but he asked if he could have both put together and they accommodated him. It looked so cheesy and delicious, but I was too busy enjoying my delicious cheesy chicken parm to even ask for a bite. He said it was amazing. The meatballs I tried and they were good, but a little cold on the inside. We all sat in silence for a good 15 minutes eating. We all agreed that it was a delicious meal and no one had any complaints.  Even after all that food, Rachel and I ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert, because YOLO. The cake has to be ordered when you order your entrees, because they are made to order. This cake was nothing short of delicious. It came hot out of the oven, garnished with pistachio crumbs and a sweet vanilla sauce. When I dug into the cake, I got a spoonful of hot, creamy chocolate and it was divine. This cake was the perfect end cap to wonderful dinner with wonderful frands.",

I ordered linguini with clam sauce and it was so salty, I was unable to eat any of it. My partner's chicken Parmesan was also very salty and he only ate 1/2. It took our server another 30 minutes to stop by to see how our meal was. We immediately asked for the check and expressed out disappointment in their service and quality of the inedible meal.

I really wasn't super excited about what I tasted , ambience is great , but food wasn't as good as I expected ?? I had cesar salad was ok , calamari was really good , antipasto salad was tasteless . Several other people ordered more main dishes and said they were ok , I would possibly go back again and order something different ....",

My only compliant is the wait time is kind of LONG. And occasionally the chef is off. It's absolutely affordable and authentic in my opinion. The drinks are great too. Just typing this makes me want to go have dinner tonight. YUM!  PS MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION!",

    "text": "In a single word: Spectacular.  Recommended as a great date night type of place, we visited Nora's on a Friday night. From the moment you walk in you realize the great vibe and upbeat atmosphere in this place. The beautiful decor, inviting patio, and cordial staff make a lasting first impression.  After only waiting for a few minutes, we were taken to our table and enjoyed some fresh Italian bread and olive oil. Our server was ridiculously attentive and really made us feel special and well taken care of throughout the night. His recommendations for the food and wine were on point, with every dish being freshly prepared and bursting with flavor. I will say that the Crazy Alfredo was great, but really lacking in the shrimp department (only ?!?).  At the end of it all, we had 4 glasses of wine, an appetizer, two main dishes, and two desserts (sorry, I do not remember all the names). The best part? It all came to $100 (not including tip).  I will keep this place in mind for the next time I want a romantic dinner with my better half.",

I had the brazino which was perfectly cooked,  moist and crispy skin on both sides! Son had canneloni. The waiter surprised him with bday dessert off tiramisu. Great ambiance.  Best service. Deducting a star because we paid cash and waiter brought back $20 change instead of the $60 we were owed . When we brought it to his attention he didn't hesitate to give us the $40 immediately. Which made us think he was pocketing the $40. So go there and enjoy yourself and you'll have a great meal only make sure when the bill comes that it's correct and you get the proper change .",

The food is delicious, the portions are big enough to take another meal or 2 home, the service is quick, and an awesome atmosphere.   Just recently checked out their newer location and it is so much better as before you had to wait 20-30 minutes before getting seated (even if you had a reservation). This last time my family and I went we were seated right away with our reservation and the space is much bigger. There is staff everywhere and they're very attentive no matter who's table it is!   The food portions are HUGE, but delicious and quite rich for those of you who plan to order their marinara sauce. They are accommodating to vegetarians as they have a couple dishes on the menu...  Wine selection is good, but prices are a slightly high. Always worth it for a good time, though and you can take the bottle home if you don't finish it.   Will definitely come here more often now that they have a bigger space!",

However, we have visited the new Nora's several times since they have moved and been disappointed each and every time.  Either the order never got in or they forgot our food.  One of the times it sat on the warmer so long that there was a nasty film on my chicken marsala.  We thought at least they still made good pizza.  We ordered a large last night and the crust was burnt, hard and the the price was high.  We tried several times thinking that it would get better, but it hasn't so sorry to say that one of our best places to eat is off our list.  The ambience is great if that is what you consider important.",

As soon as we walked in, we could tell it was a popular place, as there were many people already there. They seated us in a room that was by itself since we had a party of 8. We got our drink order in right away, but only half came when she brought them. It was all iced tea and water. We didnt get the rest of the tea for about 10-15 minutes. This set the tone for the rest of the service we received. The food was very good, although the marinara sauce was rather bland. I personally had the rib eye and thought it was cooked very well, but the seasoning was a tad salty. Not enough to ruin the steak though. We had a lovely time, they were very accommodating with everything we asked for. The reason I am giving it three stars is simply for the LACK  of service we received. We were told they would be right back for refills multiple times and with garlic bread and then they never came back. The waitress we had bordered on rude and it just put a damper on things a bit. I would go back for the food, but I'm not sure the service is worth the price.",

The salad was ample, with lots and lots of roasted peppers marinated with garlic, just like I make at home, but rarely bother to do.  The pasta portion was fine for me, having started with a salad, but I would have been wishing for more if that was the only thing I had ordered.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, while the sauce was tomatoey goodness.  I soaked up every bit with the complimentary garlic bread.  The food came out quickly and the waiter kept my iced tea refilled.  I was surprised at  how nice the dining room was, with white tablecloths and big windows letting in the sunlight.  The quality of my experience was way above the price I paid.  I'm looking forward to returning with a friend and maybe sitting at the lovely bar.",

It was kind of awkward how long the ignored us for.  We were asked to be seated outside because the weather was perfect.  We really liked the patio area - it's really nicely built.  The chairs were comfy for outdoor seating too.  I had a draft beer and wife had a cocktail from the menu.  It ended up being $20 for the two drinks.

We also had the Chicken Marsala - the marsala sauce was a bit too sweet for us (it had a strong \"maple syrup\" taste). It came with a side of pasta, with a simple marinara sauce that was not great.

We loved the set up of the restaurant, ambiance and location.  It's conveniently located right off of Flamingo and Lindell with ample parking even for the busy Friday night that we went.   We were a little discouraged when we saw a lot of open seats and they said it may be 45-60 mins to be seated.  It only took 15 tho so no worries there.  They offer barside seating, huge dining rooms and a few private rooms.  Very cool.  As soon as your seated you'll receive some breadsticks (amazing).  Then we got our drinks (Stella, iced tea, water and wine with dinner).  We proceeded to get Pork loin, Salmon and some pasta.  Everything was great.  Everyone in our group enjoyed it thoroughly and we will definitely be back.",

I ordered the Frutti Di Mare which had generous amounts clams, shrimp, mussels and calamari over linguine pasta in a red sauce and it was exceptional! The serving size was a very generous portion and my unfinished portion came home in a take out. The service is both friendly and attentive. They also had live entertainment  (blues/jazz) which made the dining experience enjoyable. I definitely recommend this place and I feel their pricing is fair considering the portions.",

    "text": "Went on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night of the Election.  We had made reservations for 6:30 pm, but because we were a little bit hungrier than expected, we arrived at 6:00 pm.  Obviously, we were a bit too early so we waited for no longer than ten minutes to get seated for dinner.  Not a problem.  When we finally got the chance to sit down, we were immediately greeted by assistant waiters who eagerly got our drinks order.  Again, it was a busy Tuesday night so the wait for the drinks was a little bit longer but wasn't waaaay too long.  It gave us just enough time to say dinner prayers so we were thankful for that.  I ordered the Puttanesca as my entree and while it was deliciously hot and tasty, it was somewhat lacking the anchovies which I was looking forward to.  Mom ordered a Riesling from the wine collection and it was dynamite.  So good.  Ramon was our waiter and my goodness, what a terrific server.  He asked us first if we had any questions about the menu after we spent about ten minutes with the menu before he came over to take our order.  What a rare treat!  We are also grateful for the hostesses who accommodated us.  Forgive us for not remembering their names, but we do remember their faces.  We are coming back soon.",

We knew we were in the right place as soon as we walked in. The aromas and the live jazz music put a huge smile on my face. We shared Mussels Arrabiata (fantastic and spicy), my hubby had eggplant Parm and I had the Frutti di Mare. Now, as a native New Yorker and having been raised eating italian food I must tell you that this is the best Italian cooking west of NY and my Pops cooking that I have had. For me, our dinner at Nora's was a trip back home. The jazz music was awesome. It really did make a wonderful dinner - perfect. The wait staff was friendly, informative and attentive. They have a full bar with specialty cocktails - and a great Mixologist. I  wish we had a place like Noras in Sacramento. It's like having dinner with family.",

I always order eggplant parm anywhere we go that offers it..this one takes the cake! He ordered the gnocci(spelling?) In vodka sauce and requested it spicy.. he gave it a 10 and this is a man that gives everything a 8 that he likes.... we finished with the fresh out of the oven chocolate lava cake TO DIE FOR!

It took forever for her to take our order, and the three tables seated after us received their entrees before we did.  (We ordered two Spaghetti and one house salad- there were 3 of us.) When we mentioned that this did not seem right she told us she tried to get our food out as soon as possible. Tried? How does that make sense that all the tables seated around us after we were seated first received their entrees well before ours? Plus she brought out the salad first- which was supposed to be the entree for one of us so the other two were left waiting while one person ate their salad. Then of course the person with the salad was already finished by the time the other two even received their spaghetti. We were so irritated- it ruined the whole evening. Service was slow the entire time. We were ready and wanting to go- waiting for our check- when she brought out complimentary gelato. (We did not want dessert.) I'm sorry but free gelato and good food does not make up for terrible service. We will not be back.",

The tasty garlic bread & good service kept me going back. It's fairly easy to get in & out during lunchtime (a popular place for business lunches) & you can call orders in for pick up.

I have never had pizza like this. Suffice to say I ate his food instead of mine. I'm not giving 4 stars because of the scampi but for the lack of service from our server. My brother in law joined us and was given a glass and of water. He started to nibble and the server saw that. He didn't bother to offer him some of his own settings to eat with. Thank goodness we had a fork that we didn't use. The biggest issue was when he was done eating he didn't have a napkin either to wipe his mouth and hands. Thank goodness he had his handkerchief, but still it was annoying he had to use it. It wouldn't have been necessary had the server given him his own napkin and settings.  Our server should have been more observant. It's all about the service. Just that little slip on the servers part caused Nora's to lose a star. I will be back for the pizza  and hopefully I will be able to update my review to 5 stars",

Rudy described to us a couple of his signature cocktails and we decided on the lemon thyme cocktail and a mango lemon gin cocktail. Next Rudy helped us pick our entree's and told us about a chicken piccata that wasn't even on the menu! So I got the chicken piccata and my friend got the chicken carciofi. Both dishes were amazing. We asked Ryan about the desserts they hand and he informed us that the cheesecake is made locally and was amazing, so we ordered that and he did not lie! I asked for some extra strawberry sauce and instead Rudy hand cut fresh strawberries for us! Over all Rudy and Ryan made the visit amazing! The food, the cocktails and dessert was beyond exceptional.

The service was terrific and I had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and my husband ordered the lasagna. Both dishes were amazing! We loved it so much, we definitely wanted to go back. So the second time we went was on a Friday again, but this time it was about 6pm. I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and my husband ordered their special which was called crazy Alfredo. This time our waitress was okay, but seemed to be more interested in having a long conversation to the man sitting at the table next to us. The chicken fettuccine Alfredo was just okay this time, nothing special that made me want more. My husbands crazy Alfredo was not very good. There was still the tails attached to the shrimp which he had to remove and the shrimp flavor over powered the whole dish instead of complementing it. It was as if everything was cooked in the same pan with the shrimp. We were very disappointed this time. Maybe it was a different chef on the second visit because it just was not that good this time.",

This place had a nice big parking lot and a heater outside to warm people as they entered the restaurant.  I didn't have a reservation but they still immediately seated me and service here was fantastic.  The waiter and busser was very attentive and nice.  I ordered the caprese salad, and Lasagna.  The caprese salad was different.  It had an actual salad with it instead of the normal, Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil with olive oil and basalmic vinegar.   They taste was very good and I would order this again the next time.  The garlic bread was wonderful.  Full of garlic and butter and very tasty.  First order is free with meal and second order they charge a small fee I think $2.  The meat lasagna was pretty tasty but little on the small side.  I guess it was ok because I was completely stuffed after the meal.  The bathroom was clean and interior decor was little old style.  Overall a good meal and would repeat visit here again.",

We were originally seated at wobbly table and the Hostess kindly changed our seating with no hesitation. After waiting for water for 10 minutes our server came over ready to take our order and we still didn't have water at that time. After placing our wine order, I had to stop the waiter immediately to place an appetizer order. As we sat and talked we realized it's taking our order longer than anticipated. It finally came. Same thing with our food.  The waiter didn't ask if we would like anything or advised us of our food being up shortly(time frame) The waiter dropped our food off and didn't look back. Didn't ask if we needed anything. We had to ask for red pepper flakes for our pizza. We asked for water twice and received it once. Now, if someone buys a bottle of wine, isn't it just business sense to ask if they would like another bottle? (Increasing Nora's revenue/sales) Would you like dessert? I mean sell us!  We are there to dine and enjoy!!!  We wanted another bottle, we wanted to converse with our waiter, we wanted to eat until we were stuffed to the gills. Instead, we received a hurry up and eat. The food is great the service is HORRIBLE!!! I even asked the family behind me. The father wasn't happy as well.",

It was good but not quite as flavorful as I had hoped. The brown butter gravy dominated the dish. The shrimp however were cooked perfectly. For my main dish I had the Fettuccine Carbonara. I loved this dish! The pasta was cooked perfect. The sauce and ham were excellent together and was a very generous portion. Very comforting dish. The meal for 4 people including a few drinks was about $175 an incredible value in Vegas with out feeling cheap in any way. Well done!",

This is only our 2nd time here and our server, Brice, could remember our entire order, including drinks and dessert, from our 1st visit a few weeks back and even where we sat - seriously impressive! He was training someone during our 2nd visit, but he didn't miss a beat. I think that attention to detail and customer service is what keeps this place buzzing, even during weekdays. I really liked their spaghetti and meatballs/mushrooms since I've been craving a replacement for SF's Emmy's Spaghetti Shack, but what really leaves me craving this place is the pistachio cannolis! There's an option to get half-chocolate and half-pistachio, but I definitely prefer the pistachio. We've sat in the kitchen area and although a lot of workers come in and out of there, I actually enjoyed seeing everyone seamlessly go through the dinner service. I'll definitely be back to indulge on a cheat day!",

    "text": "Nora's is the whole package!  It's a quaint, neighborhood, family restaurant.  There's butcher paper on the tables, the whole place is bustling and there is a 20 minute wait out the door.    Nora's serves up hot, chewy, buttery, garlicky bread to diners.  They offer an extensive wine list and tons of specialty cocktails.  Last night, my husband sampled the pilgrim's passion.  An alluring blend of gin, passion fruit, elderflower, mint and egg whites.  I had a HUGE glass of red sangria ($7.50).    We started with the gemberroni fritti.  Lightly dusted, fried plump shrimp with mixed greens, lemon wedges, and a zesty tomato caper sauce.  ($9.95).  A great way to start.  Next, we shared the alla nora ($9.50) and the fettucini carbonara ($12.50).  The alla nora is ground beef, eggplant and spaghetti baked with a crispy crust on top.  It's really good, and a heaping portion. The carbonara was as heart stopping as you'd imagine.  Creamy, dreamy, and delectable.    We finished our hearty meal with a tiramisu.  Light and creamy and perfect coffee flavor.  The tiramisu vanished but lots of leftovers to take home otherwise.    Nora's is simply unbeatable for the value, ambience, and flavor of Italian homestyle cuisine.  If you haven't been, you must.  Make a reservation!! They are always packed....the secret is out!",

The atmosphere is as lackluster as the servers and food.  Rigatoni was highly recommended (over the lasagna) by the server. Pasta was chewy and dry due to the scant amount of sauce. As much as I love garlic, it's way over used...to the point of drowning out the flavors of any other spices or the meat. The ricotta survived the garlic tsunami only because it was in volcanic-sized dollops.  At $21 a person, for pasta and a beverage (no cocktails), I fail to understand the rave reviews. There are numerous and far better options in Vegas, several in that vicinity.",

Made an 8:30pm reservations. Arrived at 8 which is early and we didn't mind waiting.  We checked-in at the front to let her know that we're there.  The table got ready at 8:15 but the lady keep calling the wrong name, first of all if you take down the name and we checked in providing the same name you figure she will get it right, but NO! She keep calling the wrong name so we ended up seated down at 9pm.  we sat down near the kitchen which is not bad as we witness the in and out of the waiters & servers. The waiter was nice and took our order and we trusted that he got all of our order right.  But NO! He forgot the most important order the \"desert\"   we got our first order which is an appetizer, it took 30min for it to arrive and when it did it was cold . The food was good but it was cold.  then our second order did not come until 30-45 min after the first course.  The second course was better, but what we didn't like is the manager. The Manager was standing by the kitchen watching his cooks, I have never seen a manager do that! most of the restaurant manager walks around and check people that are eating making sure that their customer is/are happy but not this one he was by far the most HORRIBLE MANAGER we have encountered and gives you an attitude (what the...) when you check your food, who does that!   If you want good Italian food then come here but be prepared on the bad service specially the MANAGER.  The 2 stars is for the food!  Also, did I mentioned that their food is not cheap, you figured that the money they charge they will give you a better service, NOT!  I will not comeback here ever again!!!",

If you can't accommodate your customers with their large amount of extra seating you have, then hire a larger staff. Isn't that why you moved into a bigger building in the first place? For more business? I called around 7 pm on a Tuesday, was told it would be a 25-35 minute wait which I was not happy with but because I really love their food, I was willing to wait. I literally walked into the restaurant 5 minutes later and was told that it would then be an hour long wait due to their \"reservations and walk-ins\" coming in just recently. They don't accept reservations for less than an hour when you call but yet an hour wait is somehow acceptable to them. Sad.",

Wow, I was impressed by the service! It's an intimate establishment that treats its loyal diners with reverence.

It takes things back to the simplicity of good home made Italian food.   We had aranchini balls to start with which was very good. I had the Veal Chop special for my main and it was the best Veal Chop parm I have ever had.  We got there around 21:30 and the restaurant was still full on a weekday in Feb, but we were seated quickly.  Service was very friendly and efficient despite of it being busy. If your in the mood for excellent home made Italian comfort food this is highly recommended. I'm still drooling thinking of the food.",

    "text": "My CEO's wife recommend Nora's as a great place to get Italian food and boy did she hit the mark. We stayed at Palms so it was a quick and easy ride over to Nora's. It was $10 in a cab and the Uber ride was $8.  We ordered the Calamari was not good. It was really chewy and most likely frozen. Would not recommend it.   For dinner My boyfriend and I both ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was amazing. The garlic bread was also delicious. I mentioned in passing that we were in town for my boyfriends 30th birthday and the gave us tiramisu on the house. If you are looking for a reasonably priced Italian meal in Vegas, go to Nora's.",

    "text": "Nora's is definitely an Italian spot you want to hit up if you're into Italian food and wanting to dine away from the strip. I got the Rigatoni special ($15) and my girlfriend got the Alla Nora ($12.50). Both prices and portions were perfect for what we paid. In fact, my dish was probably 60% meat if not more. The ratios for my dish was incredible and left me feeling beyond satisfied. Additionally, I might add that my girlfriend's dish had exquisitely fried and crispy mushrooms to compliment. Pro tip: don't build your own pasta unless you're willing to spend a lot more. You will get more off the original dishes if you do substitutions. 3 pieces of shrimp (literally 3 pieces only) is a $5 charge and 5 pieces is an $8 charge. To me, that's absurd for an establishment that's not necessarily upscale. To conclude, I would come back here and try another dish because I know I'd leave satisfied and pleased. However, I'd simply hope that the wait to be served isn't as long. There were probably 2 waiters in our section running around, while 5 other employees were cleaning tables together.",

    "text": "Holy cow - last time I reviewed Nora's was 2008 ?!?! GF cravin' to-go Italian as we hibernate another weekend evening ( we are definitely way too ant-social these days )   I gotta believe I've been to Nora's at least 10 times since the last review so it gives you an idea how much I like the place.  What surprises me the most is the pricing - though I haven't been to Olive Garden in a long time I bet Nora's pricing is similar.  We went with the aracini rolls for an app, the crazy fettucini and spaghetti and meatballs for main event ( I was chastised for not getting a dessert .. next time ) - total cost $42 ( darn good value )   the food ?  gf felt the risotto rolls were \"old\" - I call BS on that - what do you want - make the risotto fresh, roll them up and put them in the fryer ?  she thought the oil might be old ...whatever, more for me !  the spaghetti and meatballs - above average - the balls might have been a little too dense ( ie no filler ) - sauce decent could have been a little thicker ( personal preference )   The crazy fettucini - your basic fettucini but they add sausage, chicken, shrimp and for a little bite - jalapeno's.  I liked it though maybe a little too much going on.  order came with garlic bread - my guess an entire head of garlic in one roll ! whew  pics attached  also, the place was packed when I picked up the order - Nora's continues to rock",

We decided to take advantage of their buy one get one free sangria offer, which their sangria was really generous in amount and pretty strong. Their Alfredo was not bad too, the veal had a pepper white wine sauce that was pretty good. Im not a fan of places that make wine reduction sauces that you cant taste any wine in, but theirs was distinctive and good. The veal was soft, and it came with an extra spaghetti plate. The first garlic bread you order is free, and nothing tastes better than free food! The bread was soft and they use real ground garlic on it, unlike some cheapie places. We also preordered the chocolate cake because it takes 25 min to prepare, but our waiter forgot to put it in, and gave us the tirimisu for free which was really nice. It was really moist and had a lot of rum it.  The ambiance is finer-ish dining and had live music very resemblant of smooth Frank Sinatra. Parking was a little packed but still not impossible. Overall it was pretty good, i wouldnt mind returning again.",

We were impressed on how beautiful it is!!  What an improvement.   Service was good.   Our food was good, too.  I ordered the Melrose with shrimp.  The pasta was cooked to perfection, the texture of the sauce was on point, and despite lacking some salt, all the elements of this dish were working quite well together.  My only complaint was that the shrimp was horribly over cooked.  It also had no flavor.  I could see they were dry as soon as my utensil touched the shrimp.  No give!  Shrimp was tough and tasteless.  Tried two shrimp hoping maybe, just maybe there might be some \"love\" still left in one of them?  Nope.  I couldn't eat another shrimp. In fact, next time, I will just order this dish vegetarian style.  Yes, the dish was that good, I'd order again.  I complained and my server seemed annoyed and they did not discount the shrimp off of our bill.   Well other than that, Nora's is legit.  I would recommend this Italian restaurant.",

This was my only complaint.  I made reservations for 4 at 9pm on a Monday night. No problems with being seated when we got there despite the packed house. Our apps included calamari, Italian hot wings and a Caesar salad. The calamari was decent but the side sauce and regular marinara was raved about by my dinner mates. The wings smelled quite spicy but enjoyable. The Caesar salad was delicious.  Two people ordered the Crazy Alfredo (one without pork, allergy). The modification had a noticeable color difference to the sauce but otherwise both dishes were said to be amazing. One ordered the Branzino, and WOW it looked so delicious! The entire plate was cleaned, even the arugula side (impressive for a man who would prefer to only eat meat/fish). Another ordered the shrimp scampi. The shrimp was said to be great but the pasta was okay.  Overall a great meal! I would come here again. I'd only want to be placed in an area where I can hear my dinner mates without all the noise.",

Norman the bartender was great (young) very professional and a good mixologist. I had veal cutlet parmesan and substituted my pasta for a ceasar salad the portions weren't large, but enough. I finished with some tiramisu, espresso and a little sambuca. All in all was a very satisfying meal. Personally I like the atmosphere in the old Nora's better, more quint this Nora's is very loud but the food is good. So. 4 stars because of the noise.",

We were ignored for a few minutes, as if no one knew who our server was. Then 3 people came to talk to us and take our order. Just weird. The last server approached the table when my friend was on the phone. We had been waiting for about 10 min, but apparently that was our problem. He stopped talking to pay attention to her and place his order. Appetizers took too long to come out, and by the time our entrees were ready, we had to leave for an appt. We had to ask a staff to find our server and get our check. We waited a few minutes and the server came to the table. Instead of being check ready, she made a comment about giving us a note explaining why we were late...what? Idk if that was her attempt at being funny, but she wasn't! Then she excused herself and went to get our check.  The whole experience was painful. I'll go to Capo's next time I crave Italian.",

Drinks were also a bit slow in coming. Once we were done eating, my mom asked to have what was left of her entree doggie bagged. Upon finishing dessert and getting up to leave, we realized they had forgotten to do this. Will probably give them another try, but not wowed on our first visit.",

So when I brought it to their attention the young lady up front in black acts dumb.  After this crappy service not sure I will be back in the future.",

My husband had the frutti DeMare and I had veal Parm. Both were absolutely amazing. Our service was outstanding. Our waiter, Sebastian, was awesome. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and he made sure it was extra special. He suggested their peanut buttercup after dinner drink and omg it was sooo good. If you haven't been to Nora's",

    "text": "My wife and I frequented Nora's almost every time we visited Las Vegas over the past years, even at their previous location. Every meal we had at Nora's, except for the last two times we were there have been very good. However, my focus in this review is our visit on August 11, 2018. When our group of 5 arrived we only had a short wait, which was very acceptable, albeit the table we were seated at was in a lousy location.  Too much staff and customer traffic bumping into our chairs as they passed by.   On this visit 3 of the 5 meals, including my meal were \"lousy\". The three served meals were so salty and too highly seasoned. My meal was inedible. The Chicken Parmesan, which I had ordered many times during previous visits was so bad I had to stop after the first bite. Other meals including a salad and a mussel appetizer were also too salty. The waiter acknowledged the problem and brought me a replacement dinner, which were also inedible, for the exact same reason. My mouth was so irritated I could not taste anything after the first few bites of food.  About the only positive thing that took place was that the waiter tried to rectify the problem and did adjust the final bill accordingly. However, at no time did any manager make any attempt to come to the table to apologize or even acknowledge the problem, after much complaining on my part.  I am certain there were managers in the restaurant since it was a Saturday evening.  They just don't seem to care!  Nora's grew from a local restaurant in a small shopping center, where the food was always great to a large standalone building that appears to always to be filled to capacity.  However, the food has gone downhill along with the growth.  I doubt their management even cares, which they should.  I doubt I will ever eat there again, nor will several, of the relatives who were there with me.  4 out of the 5 in our party have eaten at Lorna's before and were also disappointed in the meal.  A very disappointing evening.",

Got there 5 minutes before our reservation. Ended up waiting 20 minutes beyond our time.   They seated us in this back room with dreadful lighting. It was clearly a party room that they use for overflow on busy nights. No thanks. Terrible atmosphere and horrible lighting. The main dining and bar areas were so lively but this area was a total buzzkill.   The server we had was fairly nice when she approached us. We had a pregnant guest with us so decided not to have wine. As soon as we told her that she was MIA the entire meal. The busser essentially took care of us the entire meal. Food was mediocre at best.   Ordered the Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce and Chicken Carciofi, with some appetizers. The vodka sauce was ok. Have had just as good out of the jar. The Carciofi was supposed to be a garlic wine sauce. Tasted like chicken stock and flour. There's too many Italian options around to go and have an experience like this.",

Ambience is rustic modern Italian can both be romantic and family friendly. Priced right for the food and service. Don was on point. Sangria potent and delicious. Can't wait to try dessert!",

The garlic bread sticks are tasty. I appreciate that they brought them out right away. After we ordered, the food came to our table in about 15 mins.

I ordered their Crazy Alfredo since that's what the reviews said they're popular for and I ordered it to go. It also came with their signature garlic bread. It was $25 but it was a generous portion. My honest review of the pasta was that it had too much going on. There was jumbo shrimp chicken sausage mushroom tomatoes jalapenos. I wish there was more noodle and less of the other things. I got full less than half way through. But overall taste wise I give it 7/10. I still think Olive Garden shrimp Alfredo is better. But Nora's garlic bread I loved it! It was a nice size and it was crispy and garlicy. But I'm not too much in a rush to go back but it was just okay.",

BTW: Make reservations or eat early because by the time we were done dining, there was quite a wait. We ordered Boar meat pasta, Lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs. The Boar meat was quite salty, the spaghetti and meatballs were just above average, the Caesar salad was wonderful with the garlic bread and the lasagna was amazing with lots of cheese. I would have given it 5-stars but when I mentioned that the water glass had a chip in it and requested a new glass nothing was offered. I think, I will try the eggplant parmigiana next time.

We waited for an hour, which we were fine with, but they gave us no updates, and were constantly talking in a group with each other rather than helping the guests. We had luggage, which I think made us bump to the bottom of their 'wait' list. There were at least 3 other 2 person couples that came in after us and were seated before us, which was very frustrating.",

The ambiance has certainly grown since Nora's humble beginnings. The new place is quite an eye catcher - spacious and cleverly decorated -  giving off hints of a New York ristorante. At times during certain nights, you can catch some live music, which adds to Nora's appeal. The food was just as tasty as i had remembered. This time i took my wife and daughter (it was their first time there) and they loved it. Everything about this place is a hit, and i absolutely love that feeling of home (NY) i still get here.",

We were quoted a 2.5-3 hour wait or we could sit outside on the heated patio.  Granted it was windy and cold outside but I really wanted to try their Chicken Marsala.  We decided to sit on the patio, all by ourselves.  It was cold even with the heater and we did sit out there for maybe 10 minutes before we were acknowledged.  But once we were acknowledged, service was good.  I started with the Pasta Fagioli Soup.  It was good but not super memorable.  The Chicken Marsala was really good.  Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful and had enough mushrooms.  My husband ordered his usual Chicken Parmesan.  He liked the flavor but said his chicken was a little tough.  Their garlic bread is amazing.  Like I said, our service was good and it was quiet outside until a large party with kids came outside to wait for their table.  The kids were screaming but the most annoying part was the loud, pompous man with them demanding his table inside.  He marched around like he owned the place.  Unfortunately, they finally got their table when we were ready to leave.",

They said it would be a 20 minute wait, but then 2 minutes later said a table was ready.  Not sure what that was about.    Anyway, we loved the Nora salad, and I got spaghetti with meatballs.  The sauce was delicious, a little on the salty side which I love, and also had a little spice which didn't bother my 6 year old at all.  My son got a 12\" pepperoni pizza and ate 4 slices.  My husband got the clam sauce spaghetti which he liked.  It was an excellent deal and I will definitely be going back.",

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the food is a bit heavy but hell what Italian food isn't heavy. A must is the Tiramisu. Absolutely fantastic. On occasions there is a live band playing. Took my wife their for her birthday.",

Anyway, we ordered fried calamari and a salad as an appetizer. Fried calamari was good by itself. Not too salty. Just right and crunchy. No lemon or marinara sauce needed. Complimentary garlic bread came with it too which was really good. For my dinner entre I ordered the shrimp scampi which came with lingunie. The whole plate can fill you up without having an appetizer. We also ordered the cannoli for dessert. It's homemade with 100% riccotta cheese, bits of pistachio, and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I think the one at NOVE  is still the best I've ever tasted. Overall, a great Italian restaurant to dine in.",

We were served the complimentary one basket of garlic bread. If you want some more garlic bread, it's $1.50 per basket. It was ok. I ordered the lasagna and my bf ordered the \"works\" which is a mixture of sausage, jalepenos, shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes, and pasta. My lasagna was gross. It had pounds of cheese to mask the nasty flavor of the dish. I couldn't figure out what the flavor was sort of like nutmeg. The works dish was somewhat better. The shrimp was good and the sausage but seperate. All together it was rather nasty. Yes, its not expensive, but save your money its not worth it. We left very dissappointed.",

It gets very good reviews on yelp and TA, has reasonable prices and they do my favorite dish - Veal Marsala. I had signed up for email specials and had a coupon for 1 free appetizer and dessert and another coupon for 10% off. They accepted both coupons! The dining room is all tables and chairs with butcher paper topped white tablecloths. The entire ceiling is covered in trinacria (the 3-legged symbol on the Sicilian flag). Casual enough for jeans. The lady at the next table was also celebrating her birthday, today! Again, small world. She said I had to try the Berry Explosive - she was RIGHT! The food was the best Italian we've had in 20 years - I kid you not - I wish I could write a description of how it tastes besides saying OMG it was good!  Garlic Bread Arancini (4) for an appetizer Crazy Alfredo for hubby Veal Marsala for me Tiramisu for dessert Berry Explosive (I'm hooked - it went well with the meal too - go figure) Jack for hubby  The bill came to $49.00 - deal of the century for food & drink this good! I'll never come to LV again without eating at least one meal here.",

    "text": "I guess I had high hopes when I finally had the time and reason to go to this restaurant,  I was thoroughly underwhelmed.  I have heard of Nora's Cuisine from tons of people.  They always say they are the best at Italian cuisine.  I for one as I said, was underwhelmed.  We had their garlic bread basket and all have to say is that it is definitely garlicky!  I am not sure if it's the an area that they're representing, but whatever it is, the food either was under seasoned or intentionaly just bland.  I ordered the Chicken Masala that came with a side of pasta with tomato sauce.  The Marsala was cooked very well and tasted awesome.  The side of pasta was another thing altogether.  The pasta was way too al dente!  The sauce lacked any seasoning.  It's like they opened a tomato sauce can and just put iton top of the undercooked pasta. My partner ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.  I don't know about you but I always associate parmigiana with a bread crusted, flattened chicken breast.  Apparently, that ain't so!  The chicken wasn't breaded at all.  He also has the same complaint about the tomato sauce: bland.  After a lackluster dinner, we opted to have the chocolate souffle which we ordered at the beginning of the meal.  I have to say, this concoction of chocolate souffle with vanilla sauce and pistachio was pure heaven.  But this dessert won't change my review of Nora's.    One other point of contention that this place needs to revise: their waiters just plain suck!  The waiter in charge of our drinks was very attentive, but the main waiter who took our order barely showed his face.  We had questions and he wasn't around.  When he was around and we asked why the chicken wasn't breaded for my partners' Parmigiana, all he said was, \"I don't know.  Weird right?\". I was baffled to say the least.  We finally got our answer by looking it up on Wikipedia.  I have to say, Nora's really FAILED to impress me.  For our 4 year 11 month anniversary(we're leaving Las Vegas and wanted a nice celebration in the city before we left), Nora's just didn't deliver the ambiance we were looking for.  They need to fix their wait staff and warn their customers on which area of Italy they are representing.",

We called a few weeks in advance to reserve for a party of 12 and we were told they had to split us up into two tables. This did not seem like a problem until we arrived and they seated us in separate rooms. We also tried to change our reservation as soon as they opened that day to add one more person and we were told we could not. So in order to have everyone fed, we had a table of 8 in one room, a table of four in the second room, and one person at the bar. At the table of 4, it took 20 minutes just to receive our salad but dinner went pretty easily after that. We took out time and enjoyed all the delicious flavors. When we were done and getting ready to pay the check for the entire party we found out that the table in the other room hadn't even received their entrees yet. At this point we had all been seated over an hour so I'm not sure what the hold up was. Thankfully we had scheduled two hours for dinner because we barely made it out at the two hour mark to get to a show after. I would come here again but I would never bring a party here.",

We always try to order something new and different each time we go and nobody has been disappointed. Even me who is a chef and is very weary about ordering pasta at a restaurant even though a simple dish to make can turn into a catastrophe with a poorly made sauce loves the baked ziti. I can go on and on but u get my drift. If you are in Vegas and you are looking for a great place to eat and drink this is the place. P.s Even my mother who wont eat anybody's sauce but her own loves this place and if you knew her you would really take that into consideration. Lol",

The menu looked good so we ordered.  When I arrived to pick up my food, I was skeptical when I saw it was in a strip mall.  But once I walked through the doors, I felt like I was transported to a NYC Italian restaurant. From the checkerboard floor and exposed brick walls to the servers rushing around with plates of food, I was immediately excited for what I had found.  As I waited for my order, I was surprised at how busy this place was.  It appeared if you did not have a reservation, it would be a long wait.  It was fun watching this place move.  I even snapped some photos to show my wife back at the hotel.  It really did feel like I was somewhere else.  And the food was awesome!  We got the large (or huge) Antipasto salad, the penne with Gorgonzola sauce with chicken, penne with marinara and yummy meatballs, steak bruschetta, and some delicious garlic bread.  And the hostess to took my order and got me my food was really friendly and helpful.  5-stars...and this is from a guy who doesn't really like Italian.",

That's right this place was a solid OK. I can't believe the yelp team couldn't identify average food! The salad was something you buy at the grocery store in a bag. As for the meatballs, it tasted as though they had been made 3 days ago and simply heated. They tasted old and manufactured like something you would eat at a potluck for retired people. The best part of the dinner was the wine. Bottom line, if you want a place that isn't going to break the bank and you are craving Fazoli's, go to Nora's on W. Flamingo. If you are looking for a good Italian meal on the west side . . . try Mastrioni's.",

Had to detour to this place because Pizza Monzu was closed for the night due to a private party. I put my number on the wait list but went to the bar since there were a few seats open there. We ordered the...  5/5 Garlic Bread - This was so garlicky and I loved it. This is my kind of bread.  5/5 Nora's Lemon Drop - Well balanced and not too sweet. Nice touch from the sugared and flamed lemon slice.   5/5 Sicilian Mule - Great alternative to a Moscow Mule. Good Limoncello that they used made this Sicilian.  4/5 House Salad - Was usual, nothing special.  4/5 Grilled Octopus - Some pieces were a salt-bomb but mainly pretty good. I love me some good grilled octopus. The veges that came along with it was really good.  4/5 Crazy Alfredo - Really good flavors but I didn't care for the sausage, shrimp, or the pool of oil in the bottom of the dish. I liked the mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.   2/5 Tiramisu - Soggy and Gross! The texture was so off that I couldn't have more than a bite. I like it when it is smooth, creamy and melts in your mouth with good marscapone cheese and lightly soaked ladyfingers. This was nothing like that. It was heavily soaked. The liquid just burst out and was overwhelming. I would say one of the worst Tiramisu I've tasted.   The majority of the employees were nice and was working pretty diligently. The only really upsetting experience for me that night was that when I was ready for my pasta to be boxed up... They took it away and set it on their service counter at the bar for a good 5 minutes. That was cringingly disgusting and has to be some kind of health code violation because they were working above it and talking all over it. I watched them for the whole entire time. Their elbows were almost touching it and they were clearing up dirty dishes right above it. I was so grossed out and didn't want to take it home. I was trying to leave it behind but was reminded of it and just took it home to be courtesy. I'm not even going to bother risk eating all the germs from that leftover.",

We shared a small antipasto salad. We were celebrating a birthday so they brought a dessert to help us celebrate. Great service as my water cup was kept full and they packed up the leftovers.

Our appetizer was a simple order of mozzarella sticks, but the taste was anything but they were delicious not your normal cheap mozzarella sticks these were obviously made with quality cheese. The service was great our waiter, Anthony,  was always attentive to our needs and never let our sodas get to empty before asking I'd we needed a refill! The atmosphere inside is so nice and calm, they have music playing but not so loud that you can't talk very relaxing.",

    "text": "Nora's was a staple in my family's culinary adventures for the past decade, but all that changed Thursday, January 31, 2019, when my car was vandalized.  Long story short, anyone visiting Nora's new location knows they didn't build the new property with guest parking in mind, so patrons have to park in the adjoining neighborhood, or at the offices across the street. This isn't just unnecessary and inconvenient (especially since Nora's isn't a fast casual, cheap eatery), but this can put patrons in a dangerous situation.   Anyone reading this review needs to understand WHY I am so upset about the situation, because life happens like it did to us. I am upset because of the WAY our situation was handled, and am upset that I even had to have this exchange with a Nora's in the first place. They truly made us feel like our patronage doesn't matter.  I am including photos of the damage to my car, and all the emails that occurred between management and myself.  If for some reason you can not see them here on YELP, feel free to go to my Instagram (ediblechaos) where I'll post everything in full.    One final thing, the owner emailing a final response telling me how right I was in two sentences only nailed down the insincerity we felt all week. It was like a husband admitting guilt to get his nagging wife to shut up. I would have rather heard radio silence.   Nora's has AMAZING food and we have always had fantastic service from their hourly employees. Maybe those in charge could take a lesson.   I post this to let people know this could happen to them when visiting Nora's, and this could be their response. Hopefully, that isn't the case for others in the future.",

Service Overall very polished! We had a reservation on a Monday night and were seated about 10 minutes after our time. The place was packed!  We were promptly greeted by the server, and he was attentive throughout always refilling our soft drinks quickly. The meal was well-paced and not rushed nor slow. Fresh silverware was provided after each course - a small touch, but don't you hate going to a restaurant and being told to \"keep your fork!\" as if they only allow one per guest. A bus boy graciously packed our leftovers for us which we appreciated.   Ambiance  Sorry Lola, Nora wins here hands down. Modern upscale interior. Extremely classy. No booth seating, however, so when it's crowded it doesn't feel too intimate or private.    Food Truly exceptional.  Lola might have the slenderest advantage, but wow it's a close call. We started with two wonderful cocktails including a peach Bellini. Tasty and great presentation. We had some soft drinks too which were constantly refilled. We had arancini as an appetizer which was ok.  A bit mushy on the inside. Then a Caesar salad which was very good. Truly tasty dressing and fresh lettuce. The garlic bread was exceptional!  We had read on Yelp only one basket per table was allowed, but we asked for more which wasn't an issue at all (no charge). It would honestly be pretty gauche for a place like this to charge for more bread. Entrees were... amaze balls! Chicken Parmesan and pork fillet. Wow. Huge portions (see photos) and both were flavorful tasty meat. The pasta with the chicken was wonderfully al dente.  Very large portions (plenty leftover for both). For dessert a slice of spumoni (so so tasty and flavorful) and bread pudding. The bread pudding - wow!  Not like the typical dry bread but so soft and moist like a custard. Lola's is similar, so this must be an Italian style bread pudding. So delicious - you mustn't pass this up!!  Mojo Overall an outstanding place with great service and exceptional Italian food. Lola's might take a slight edge for its homey authentic atmosphere and overall taste, but if you aren't up for a trip to Ohio you must (really you MUST) eat at Nora's!!  Total bill for two cocktails, an appetizer and a salad, two entrees, and two desserts was about $100. Very reasonable for the quality of the food!",

But tonight an opportunity to deliver that service arose, and they really disappointed me. I came with my family for Mother's Day, the 4 of us. While waiting for our appetizers, a woman walking past our table fainted. My father jumped up and caught her while I called 911. The ambulance came and the EMTs had to set up a pop-up med center right next to our table- making my parents share a seat for about 30 minutes while they attended to her next to our feet. After the whole fiasco was over, we finished our dinner while the wait staff tried to avoid bringing up the situation. They were very sweet to us... but after our entire experience took a turn for the worse, I was shocked that nobody addressed the issue or even offered to take care of my moms glass of wine for the horrendous inconvenience. This is out of the restaurants control, I understand. But really, even though we smiled and brushed off the whole thing, it was in very bad taste for the management to completely ignore the whole thing as if nothing happened. I'm a forgiving fellow employee in the industry, but Nora's has lost my parents business.",

While we may come back in the future it will definitely not be on a holiday. They definitely added tables and overwhelmed the staff trying to get every penny out of the holiday they could. We touched elbows with the tables next to us and basically shared conversations. It also took 45 min for someone to bring water and ask us if we wanted drinks.   Food was good but not amazing. The desserts must have been made the day before to handle the holiday as they didn't taste fresh.    I think the only reason I would go back is because of their passion fruit mint julep. I tip my hat to their mixologist for making this Divine cocktail.",

I mean how could it not be?   SO this is a Las Vegas gem! It's in a super random location but it's worth the drive anywhere you live. The inside of the restaurant is clean (although the bathroom sinks are kind of awkward - like they tried to be high tech but it didn't work really well...it's a sink/hand dryer combo) and they have a wall wine (so obvi I'm already a fan). Okay enough about the inside, time for the food.  We ordered: pomodoro bruschetta, crazy pasta, and frutti di mare (subbed with arriabiata (sp?) sauce). Everything was so delightfully delicious! The seafood in the frutti was perfectly cooked and the combination of all the flavors in the crazy pasta worked oddly well (I only had a bite of the crazy pasta but my mind went crazy - I'll have to order it next time).   The service was great! And big points to Nora's for having my favorite beer (Hitachino white ale)!",

The decode is nice an modern an it's very open. They have a lot of seating but beware on the weekends this place is packed. So if you can make a reservation. Th kitchen is open which I live as you can see everything being cooked an the smells coming from there make you even more hungry. They have great lunch specials an offer a wide variety of choices. The regular menu had amazing choices as well. I live how they bring you it garlic bread an take your drink order right away. For lunch on this day I had a regular house salad an added chicken to it needed some protein. An a cup of chicken soup. The salad was amazing an was very filling. An the soup just as good. Both just the right amount to fill you up. My husband had the sub which was great as well. The homemade chips are great as well as the fries an sauce. I will definitely go back again for lunch an even dinner. Can't wait to try more of the menu.",

Eating the Arancini with the basil leaf was yummy. As for the entree, we had the Frutti di Mare, Fettuccine Carbonara, Chicken Parmigiana, and Grilled Branzino. All of the entrees were great. Suprised that the grilled branzino comes in as the whole fish; which is an added bonus. There Frutti di Mare was one of best I had. After chatting with our waiter, Sebastian, who by the way was pretty awesome; made the dining more lively. He was very attentive and accommodating. I would definitely and highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a wonderful Italian dining experience outside the Las Vegas Strip.",

    "text": "Lets remember 3/5=average, 4/5=above average, 5/5=amazing. I give this place a 4/5 came here friday April 28, 2017 Let break it down...  Overall experience 4/5 Reason being we had a 7:15pm dinner reservation, however did not get seated until after 8pm and waited another 20 minutes for bread and wine.  Our appetizers didn't get to us until almost 9pm.  Our server was Jessica...She was amazing.  The problem wasn't her it was the lack of policy the restaurant doesn't have in regards to large party payments.  Being a waitress prior I understand that a party of 10 w/separate checks will happen, but poor thing had two parties of 10 separate checks we witness as she served different receipt books.  So needless to say we understood how busy she was, but my gosh it's a friday night, couldn't the party arrange something else, or the restaurant have a rule.  Then the funny thing was, Jessica finally got to us and the other party interrupted in the middle of taking our order and pulled her back to the table.  Jessica was very kind and apologetic, but the restaurant owners should really put a stop to large party separate checks on friday/saturday nights.  Service 5/5 Jessica was very friendly and delightful, you would have never have known her chaos unless you witness it.  She never complained and never showed it on her face.  Food 4.5/5 In between above average and amazing.  Octopus was my favorite.  I love the jasper grilled items, great flavor.  Atmosphere 4/5 It is VERY loud inside if full.  Waiting area was very small and crowded with minimal sitting inside.  The decor is new and fresh, which looks great.  If in heels the floor is slick! BEWARE.  I will be excited to come back and enjoy the patio area under better weather.  We had a great evening and will return again!",

My 4 year old was with my hubby and I as well. We all had something different. Veal scalopini, osso bucco, alla nora, traditional spaghetti and red sauce with sausage. (The last for my picky 4 year old). I have never seen my 4 yr old eat so much food and want more of it. The waiters were very attentive to all the fork and knife dropping of this little guy and brushed it off as nothing. My MIL and FIL are used to \"dining well\" at upscale places and this pleased them very much- eve to say- they would love to come back again. I had the all nora and had enough left to take home and have for breakfast:) served with an over easy egg- voila! Delicious breakfast for the win!  We had the Oreo ice cream and panna cotta- get the panna cotta!!! Big enough to share even though you won't want to. This family owned restaurant is a gem. TIP: Go with 5 -6 friends and reserve the secluded spot in the front with your very own door to close for the most privacy!",

Food is made when you order it and tastes sooooo good. The garlic bread alone got me reeled in! It is pretty busy, even with a reservation we had to wait a bit. This is a tourist spot. So if you're a local you will have to deal with 'that' crowd. Our waiter was beyond words (sorry the name escapes me), he could tell we were celebrating and gave us a complimentary dessert. He definitely went above and beyond in taking care of us, along with explaining everything and recommending a great dish. This is definitely a new restaurant to add to our date night rotation.",

We arrived around 7:30 and were seated around 8:15. The place was packed!  As others have commented, the garlic bread is a nice touch. The waitress took our drink orders, two glasses of wine, and two diet cokes. The wine came in little carafes to pour in your glass. My friend had about 1/4 of her Sauvignon Blanc left when the waitress came and took it away without even asking. Only one of us was given a glass of water. About halfway through the entree, a waiter came and took our diet cokes (which were half full), ostensibly to refill them. He only brought one back.  Two of us ordered the Wild Boar Pappardelle and one ordered the eggplant parm. The egglplant parm portion was huge. Both dishes were really tasty and reasonably priced.   I also noticed the staff walking around the restaurant were acting as if patrons were in their way and would push past you if you were walking between tables.  Our waitress did ask if we wanted separate checks at the end and said it would be \"very easy\", which I thought was nice as most restaurants discourage this.",

    "text": "We were big fans of Nora's at the old location. It was local, warm and friendly, and really felt like a family owned business. While service was a bit hit-or-miss at times, the quality of the food more than made up for it, and when the staff made mistakes, management was always quick to offer compensation. We always felt we were going to a friend's house for lunch or dinner. And there was a definite Vegas \"vibe\" to the place; one could imagine the old-time mobsters having a meeting at the back table.  Alas, the new restaurant looks and feels like a chain restaurant. The decor and atmosphere are similar to any Macaroni Grill. With the exception of the music (jazz standards, very nice), the restaurant could be picked up and directly transported to any large city in North America. The mobsters, I'm sure, have found another Vegas haunt. The romance is gone.  The food remains pretty much the same, if you're lucky enough to have it delivered before it gets cold! The service is dreadful. My first experience was take-out. The pizza was brought out first, and the hostess informed me that she was waiting on the chicken. After about five minutes, I asked if the pizza shouldn't be held someplace to keep it warm while waiting for the chicken - \"oh, we have no place to do that.\" REALLY? The pizza was cold before I got back to the car! And although apologies were offered by the front staff, but no mention of any compensation.  We went for lunch, and experienced more bad service: We had to hail a waiter to get water and drinks after 15 minutes of not being acknowledged. We ordered pizza and chicken again, and a regular house salad. The pizza was lukewarm. I guess the same thing happened that occurred with our take-out order. The server never even apologized for his lack of attention (nor did anyone else). And the bill came to eighty bucks for pizza, chicken piccata, salad and two glasses of wine ((which we had to order by intuition; a wine menu was never proffered).  It's a damned shame to see a cozy, friendly familiar place turn into a cookie cutter chain restaurant. I'm afraid we'll be looking for a new Italian \"joint.\"",

I finally went and to say the service was 'meh' would be an understatement at best.  I'm not one for negative reviews unless the experience was really impacted, but in this case it was.  It was birthday dinner and the server brought me a piece of tiramisu after the lackluster pizza with no cheese that she didn't mention.  I thought well at least this is nice, a birthday desert.  She literally tosses the plate on the table, my mouth opens to say thanks, and she abruptly turns and meanders away.  The entire night was the same, ok food, unattentive service, not really pleased I wasted a birthday dinner with family and friends here.  Better places in Vegas where the servers actually look you in the eye and spend more than 10 secons at your table.  My friend who has been several times even commented on how off the service was.  Shame.",

Nice classic drinks too, especially their Negronis and Old Fashioned(s).   I've liked most items I've had here food wise, namely: the rib eye, salmon, branzino and the wild boar ragu pappardelle.   I highly recommended calling for reservations/waits for parties greater than two during dinner time. They are pretty busy on the regular and even with the lady and myself we've had waits and had to go to the bar (not like that's a bad thing though).",

    "text": "Overall, my experience at Nora's was solid, and I plan on returning. A little detail, and I'll start with weaknesses because they were (in my opinion) not deal breakers:  -The hostess who sat us was kind of a brat. I don't want to say she was rude, because she wasn't necessarily rude.. They were super busy, so maybe she was just in the midst of something frustrating. Anyway, her attitude just came off as bratty.  -I thought our waiter was going to be the same because of how he answered a question I asked regarding a menu item, but he ended up warming up to us (once the rush died down). -The layout is NOT ideal. It is crowded and busy. We ended up getting completely blocked in because they had to put a couple tables together to seat a large group, so that was a little frustrating for us and for our waiter. (They are moving soon, so I am assuming this won't be an issue once they move.) -It took a while for our food (~40 minutes for baked rigatoni and chicken parm). As with all of the above, I figure this was because of how busy they were (we were there at 8 pm on a Sunday, btw--we were glad we made a reservation!) Like I mentioned, none of those are deal breakers for me, but they are the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 this time around.  Now for the good.... THE FOOD OMG. The garlic bread was awesome. The chicken parm was good my husband loved it, I'm just not a big fan, as the chicken doesn't typically have a lot of flavor and I'm weird like that). The baked rigatoni was fantastic. The meat sauce was just like I remember growing up with Italian family--you could tell that it was cooked right, because it had that brownish color that a good meat sauce gets. The ricotta on top of the rigatoni was AMAZING. Just good, good food.  We are excited to return once they move locations (honestly, maybe even before that).",

Been here twice now and this Saturday night was my finale. Teenage hostess attitude is totally unacceptable, unbearable and downright snippy and rude. I called to make a reservation and the teenage 'Flo' like girl says Im sorry we don't take reservations. So I come to restaurant and find that I am asked if I have a reservation. WTF! I tell her no because when I called in they said they don't take them. She tells me that'll be 40 mins. My party of 4 waits 15 mins at which time we are seated in the raised cafe bar tables. Super uncomfortable and should be removed from this establishment. I know the diner hostess put us there on purpose lol. Food was mediocre at best, meat sauce was bitter and left me night time memoirs. Sausage links were stone cold and entrees were all luke warm. To top that off, the service was absent and it took an hour to receive our meals. Seriously folks....your food and your tude just isn't deserving of my gracing your establishment's presence. This is not New York, nor is this a real Italian joint, so do your patrons a favor and drop the attitude about which customers you care for and which one's you don't. We as customers could give a care less about who you want in your restaurant, so treat them all with top notch service, food and respect. Oh and PLEASE get rid of the 3 Applebees Girls you have tending to the hostess station. They are losing you business and loyal customers with their condescending tone, attitude and demeanor.",

First came the garlic bread. The garlic bread was just how garlic bread should be... crispy, buttery, and full of garlic! it was soo good we ordered another (the 1st garlic bread is free then $1.50 for each additional).   For appetizers, we ordered the Steak & Arugula Bruschetta which was a good change from the usual tomato version. It had thin cuts of steak with arugula & vinaigrette on top of french bread.   But the reason for the 3 stars is because of the entrees. K.L. had ordered the Linguini & Clams which were so bland! Surprising since the bread was so flavorful. I had ordered the Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce, which was so much better than the linguini, but i probably would not order again.  The service was great and the place did get slammed right after we walked in so i would like to give Nora's another try... and another free sangria.",

The hostess was friendly when seating us. We waited about 5 minutes before being greeted by our server and asked if we were ready to order. We then told him it was our first time here and would like some recommendations, he wasn't very friendly and seemed to be rushed. We got the ceaser salad that was way over dressed and tasted like an overkill of anchovies, we couldn't eat it. My husband had the chicken Milanese and was very bland and lacked flavor. I had the lasagna it was just ok but the pasta was very mushy definitely wouldn't recommend. My kids had chicken parmesan it was the best one out of the three dishes, but the marinara sauce could definitely have a little more flavor and seasoning. Never really saw the server around until he dropped the check without offering dessert or asking if we wanted or needed anything else which I wanted dessert, but when someone drops the check it must be because you don't want us to spend anymore money or appreciate our business. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. I was watching the server next to us and he was amazing at interacting with his tables and recommending dishes with wine and constantly being visible to where if his tables needed anything he was on it. My husband and I had to ask his name it was Donald he was amazing keep up the good job. So if you do decide to go there ask for him he will give you better service and a better dining experience. I probably wouldn't go back for the food wasn't great and the lack of service that was provided and with so many other restaurants in Vegas I would rather spend my money at a restaurant with delicious food and can receive an unforgettable dining experience.",

Chicken Parm - BLAND, FLAVORLESS CHICKEN, FLAVORLESS SAUCE/GRAVY, FAKE CHEESE (Not real mozzarella)  Eggplant Parm - TOTAL MUSH and hardly any flavor in sauce either, FAKE CHEESE  Do I really have to spend $$$$ to get decent Italian in Vegas??!!  :(",

The past couple of years have been awful.  I went this past weekend for my birthday dinner.  I had mentioned to them that last year they didn't have the warm chocolate cake, and I pre-ordered two of them and double checked to make sure it wouldn't be forgotten again this year. Sure enough, our waitress admitted she forgot to put in the order.  So we had to wait a long time after we were done eating dinner just so I could have the cake.  This wouldn't be a huge issue, except that the service was so awful and slow the entire time.  We were there almost 3 hours because it was so bad.  If the food weren't so good, I would never come back again.  Please hire better servers at this place!",

Was surprised by the number of large groups including one of 20 in the main dining room. Not sure if that's the norm. A lot noisier than I expected, including multiple renditions of \"Happy Birthday\". If you're looking for an Italian experience that's a little more on the intimate side this place may not be for you. Otherwise, all was good except that our request for a table in the bar area which was made at the time of reservation two weeks prior was not honored. Hence, we were forced to dine among the groups.",

March I was making a reservation I call the day of for a 6 o'clock reservation, I show up at the restaurant and I tell them I have a reservation and the lady says \"I'm sorry i don't have a reservation for that name. Are you sure you called ?\" She calls over another lady and they start to talk and I pulled out my phone and show then the call and how long it was and I named the person I talked to. The ladies seemed bothered but they apologize and still sat us. After that our waiter was super nice. My dad asked if they had this dish call chicken piccata because it wasn't on the menu and the waiter was super kind and said he would ask the chef. Turns out the chef could and honestly it's one of the best things I've eaten there. I'm never disappointed in the food but always something with the costumer service. This recently happened where we were seated the waiter came greater took our drinks then we waited for about 20 mins and our waiter never came back we had to ask a buster to call him the busters are always super nice.",

This place was great: good value for the cost.  The quality of the food was good for the price, portion size was good: generous without being crazy.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, my coworker had another pasta dish, I don't remember which one, but it had a meat sauce.  We split a Caesar Salad.  Wine selection was fine: plenty of options, good prices.  We didn't have room for dessert, but it looked tasty.   The garlic bread is garlic-y and yummy.  The service was excellent on this surprising busy night (we didn't have reservations, but opted to be seated immediately over by the kitchen).  Water got refilled promptly, people came by often to ensure we didn't need anything (almost, but not quite, too often).  Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to get a good quality, reasonably priced meal off the strip.  It's not super trendy or fancy, just solid food and service in a relaxed atmosphere.  Edited to add: it's not a bad idea to get a reservation if you're planning ahead.  We were fine sitting off by the kitchen, but if it were even just a little busier, we'd likely have had to wait for a table.",

I came during lunch so I took advantage of the lunch menu, and although when the dishes came out things looked small, they were far from it. It reminded me of strega nona and her endless pot of noodles. I ordered the spaghetti and meatball (1) for 5.99 and was truly satisfied.  The bread is tasty they bring out, nice and garlicky and full of butter. The server for our table was the bartender, she was very attentive and took care of us well.   The other people in the party ordered veal parm and baked ziti, everyone was happy. :)",

We were looking for a yummy alternative to the overpriced and/or overrated restaurants on the Strip and thought yelp would steer us in the right direction...not this time.

I had the tortellini with vodka sauce, My Darling had the chicken marsala, and our friend had the capellini arabbiata. The pasta was not al dente nor was it properly drained which caused the sauce to be watery. My pasta verged on the soggy...the wine choices and prices were pretty good though. While the food was supposed to be \"home-style\" and not haute cuisine, it was still lacking because the flavors and quality were not there. Generally, the only thing that was noteworthy about the food was that the prices were reasonable.   This place takes cards. There is plenty of parking in the lot.",

From this room there is an entrance to the upstairs dining room (still waiting to be finished, as of last week), and also there is an entrance to the outdoor patio dining area. On the left side they have another dining room.  They've kept the open kitchen concept, so the restaurant stays very casual.  The menu also stayed the same!  I'm very pleased to find their lunch specials unchanged, with same prices as before. I think the complementary garlic bread taste even better, knowing that at the end of your meal you'll be getting the bill, and no surprises!  Our lunch experience was very pleasant. Our waiter ( sorry, I can't remember his name) from Italy, took his time to talk to us, served our drinks and meals, and made us feel very welcome in the brand new location. I specifically asked for my sandwich to be prepared, and I got it perfectly right.  Due to food allergy, my BF also had a special request to skip certain items from the salad. He got his meal absolutely perfect. Our drinks were refilled by the busboy. Both waiter and busboys were very attentive.  We tried other menu items many times before (of course at the other location), but we are looking forward to coming back to dine here again.  Perhaps to enjoy some live music someday!",

The server said the chef changed the breading and added mint to it. Ugh what a mistake. Did not order anything else, it was over by then couldn't eat! We brought family from NY and luckily their dish, Linguine with clam sauce, was good ( so she said). I don't think we'll be back any time soon! Since they moved food is not the same:(",

The dining room is a beautiful mix of brick and stone with a nice balance of wall art. Comfortable seating at large tables is available throughout. The background music combined instrumentals and vocals was at the perfect volume with the dining room people chatter.  We were seated immediately as our arrival was ten minutes prior to the reservation time. Service was spot on efficient from ordering cocktails , maintaining the water glasses and removing the finished items. On this evening the dining room was at full capacity and our server Kenia followed up on our satisfaction as she made the rounds.  The bread basket contained wonderful garlic bread so soft and warm. Hard to resist. My entree was a whole Branzino that was perfectly grilled. Crispy skin and moist inside. One of the best I have tasted. The fish was stuffed with sliced lemon and a sprig of rosemary. A few pieces of lemon  for squeezing made the fish outstanding. The dish included  tender and tasty  arugula which was the perfect complement.  My wife ordered the chicken piccata which comes with a side of pasta. The chicken was tender and the lemon wine sauce provided the perfect balance. Also the capers did not over power the dish. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was simply delicious. Both items were large enough to share or in this case to take home.   It is extremely difficult to pass up Tiramisu in a great Italian restaurant. In this case we agreed to share. The size was perfect for two people. The dessert did not disappoint. A nice combination of flavors and light on the alcohol.  Congratulation to the Mauro family on the beautiful larger location with spacious parking. Look forward to returning in day light to play bocce ball.",

    "text": "Nora's been a favorite place for Italian food for a lot of my friends and even my manager. The first time I had Nora's, I was not impressed but fast forward about two years after my first visit, I gave Nora's another try. I'm glad I gave Nora's another try because I've enjoyed every visit thereafter.   There will always be a wait at Nora's. Always. I would suggest for you to make reservations if you know you want to go and have dinner there. Sometimes, if they are backed up and running late.. you will still have to wait about 10-20 minutes even if you have a reservation.   The food is really good depending on what you order. Their pastas are amazing. I always order a pasta with arribiata sauce, al dente pasta, and extra spicy. I love how they put a lot of garlic flavor into it and they give you a good portion. I always have enough to bring home for lunch the next day. The one thing that I've tried and absolutely do not like is their chicken, which is what caused me to not go to Nora's after my first visit. I had ordered a chicken parm dish and it just did not speak to me. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you get a chicken parm or if you add chicken to your pasta (I tried that too). Their chicken is just not good. Their chicken is pretty hard and dry..very very dry. Even when I have it in my pasta with a sauce, it is still dry.   Nora's also gives you the first basket of their garlic bread for free. Complimentary on them. It's really really good. It's usually toasted nicely with tons of garlic and butter on it. It's so delicious. We tend to gobble that basket up!  As for the service, it seems pretty average to me, especially when they get busy.   Overall, definitely worth a try, worth a visit...worth several visits. It's also great for families and friends to dine together!",

My girlfriend has taken me here for my birthday for the third consecutive year and for the first two I've always gotten the shrimp scampi with linguini. Which in my opinion, may be the best in town. For my last birthday I decided to switch it up(not entirely sure why) so I got the wild boar pappardelle and I must say it was probably the best meal of my entire life. Hands down!! It was so well balanced I couldn't understand it. Noodles were perfectly cooked, boar was so tender and not dry. Honestly I haven't stopped thinking about it for the past 9 days! Well done!",

Our waters and my boyfriends soda were constantly being refilled which was nice. After our conversations, our food came (lasagna and chicken parm), but I realized my cocktail never arrived. After awhile he brought it by and said it was comped which was nice. Overall it was an alright visit and the food was tasty!

We got mussels arrabrita in spicy sauce and the promodoro bruschetta which was a bit too salty but both very delicious. I got linguini with clams which was spectacular and the red sauce was perfect. My boyfriend got the frutti de mare with angel hair and that the best dish there. Plenty of seafood and perfect sauce. I look forward to returning.",

I understand Valentine's Day is a big dining out holiday but we had a show and they were already a half hour late for our reservation so we dined at the bar , which we would have clearly rather sat down and had a nice dinner but we were time crunched , and they were late . The manager thanked us but that was it . Our experience was not exceptional in any way and the manager was giving out free champagne to a lot of other people who they were also clearly running late on there reservations but we got nothing . We didn't even have time to have dessert because the food took so long . We had to ask them to bring us bread even though it seemed like everyone else just got some . It was just frustrating when you decide to spend a special day at a restaurant and receive just a bad experience all together .",

    "text": "Great Italian food!!!  This might be our Italian Go To from now on!  Nora's looks like an Italian restaurant out of the movies... looks a lil Godfather-ish on the 'right hand' side complete with a bar and live music...  We were seated on the 'left hand' side - still very good - Appears that this side is suitable for large groups...  Onto the food... Wow!  We were on family night... this is how it went down:  First we noshed on the (free - 1st round is free) Garlic Bread... I loved that they sliced the bread very thinly - it did not fill me up... it is all in the slicing of the bread that made all the difference to me & my guys... We also had the Calamari as our appetizer (Yummy - full squid and all!)  Mom (Me): Gnocchi w Vodka Sauce w a glass of Annabella Cab Sav ;-) Geo: Pasta Alla Nora Lu: Baked Rigatoni  Everything was very tasty & True to Italian Cuisine.  I rarely every give 5 stars... this would apply especially because of the area that the restaurant is in... not the nicest... However, Nora's makes up for it!  Since, I love to review I am sharing this - even though I do not want All of Vegas there taking up my space... lol  It was quite busy, however, there was still room for more... It was a Tuesday... I would say that if you are going any other day, like say the weekend, call and make a reservation & give them at least an hour or more notice...  Salute! Cin Cin!  your constant companion,  ~deirdra",

I checked the menu and they have Frutti Di Mare! Clams Shrimp Mussels Calamari with red sauce and fettuccine! I'm SOLD.  I started with a glass of Red Sangria which wasn't bad - it was actually in a BIG ASS wine glass AND it was pretty strong. They also have a Yelp check in offer for a free second glass so I tried the White but I didn't like it - our server replaced it with another red one for me. Great!  They serve complimentary garlic bread which is SUPER garlicky so OF COURSE I loved it.  We started with a House Salad which wasn't bad. I ordered the Frutti Di Mare - Our server asked if I liked spicy at all and I said Yes! Make it EXTRA spicy. I ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs for Hunnie Bunnie and he asked if I would like to just do a Side of Spaghetti and Meatballs? Yes for sure!  The side came out and was the perfect size for her with one giant meatball on top.  Mine came out and the seafood was fantastic - LOTS of calamari and BIG mussels and shrimp! It wasn't spicy though so I dumped red pepper flakes on it.  The server was great and Hunnie Bunnie also loved it because they have paper table covers so she colored all over it. We also had dessert: Oreo Tartufu. Cookies n cream ice cream in a chocolate shell. HB LOVED it.",

    "text": "Nora's used to be my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It was a little jewel in a couple of store fronts. The place was adorable, the staff was great and the food was off the charts. It was one of my \"go to\" places on every trip to Las Vegas.  Fast forward one year: Nora's has built a multi-million new building 3 blocks east of their old location. It is state of the art and magnificent! What they left at the old location was good service and great food.  When we arrived, we encountered two young hostesses at the front desk with an aura of disdain and boredom. They told us there would be a 30 minute wait, or we could eat at the bar or on the patio. It was a beautiful evening, so we chose immediate seating at the patio. It was lovely on the patio.  We waited for about 20 minutes and flagged a passing waiter. He said our waiter was too busy, but he would try to take our order and pass it along. Yes this really happened. Another 30 minutes go by and we inquire about the status of our  dinner and drinks, the waiter apologizes and about 10 minutes  later our drinks arrive.  Our waiter finally shows up with Nora's signature garlic bread. It was cold and soggy, yeech! Then our dinner arrived, even worse! It was tepid, aesthetically unpleasing and cold. It was actually awful.  We then tried to find grated cheese for our pasta, but gave up after ten minutes, asked for a check and paid for our mostly un-eaten, disgraceful meal.  Nora has really gone from the Ritz to the pits. A sad excuse of a restaurant.   Please bring back the good old days when Nora was the best Italian restaraunt around. Today it is a pretty shell with awful food and worse service. It actually makes Olive Garden look appealing.",

Food still awesome. I have no complaints with the new location but have to admit, I did dig the \"cool factor\" of the old hole in the wall. Agree that they needed to upgrade and they did it well. Congrats on the transition. We will keep visiting as long as the food and service remains like it always has been. Tip, make a reservation. Still a busy place.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try out the new place since I saw the building going up ! Super excited about it ! Used to dine at Nora's small place all the time . Friend from work and I decided to go this past Thursday night at 8 pm. The place was packed . We went on a wait and decided to take seats at bar when they opened up . I'm not a crazy yelper so I will just share my honest opinion ...We work at a small Italian restaurant on the Strip but we love Nora's and we couldn't wait to try the food, as he's never eaten here. Food was awesome . We shared a white pizza , mussels , truffle fries and bruschetta appetizer . Food was on point , hot , fresh and the bill was only $46 . Pasta will be next time as we will return !!! We had such a good time, we sat at the bar and laughed, talked, watched the game,watched the hustle and bustle of the night... only low point was the younger male bartender . Rudest service I have had in a very long time. Never once said hi to us when we sat down . We had to ask for menus , ask to order , sat with piles of dirty dishes at the end is our meals , he asked me to move my purse so I would not hit his shaker cups, just plain nasty. Have us dirty looks all night . I mean we were dresses nice, we are polite , we work in the business , 20+ years for me and 35 + for my friend , we didn't ask for anything but menus and to order. The 2 female bartenders were busting their butts back there. When we first walked in to hostess desk , we put out name on the list and went to bar to get a drink, the dark hair bartender , young was super sweet and made one kick butt martini, probably one of the best I have ever had . Me and my friend actually talked about it for 2 days! It was perfectly crafted . So all and all , the experience was awesome , I will be back and I'm super excited about Nora's but thought the bartender should be aware that he should be a little nicer to his guests . I mean I know we can all have a bad day but it was almost uncomfortable sitting there at the bar for some reason with him . Anyways Nora's you guys ROCK!!!!$",

Of the 4 dinners we ordered 2 were sent back and 2 were not eaten. The Rib Eye steak was ordered medium rare.  It came  45 mins. later \"extra well-done\"  I couldn't even cut it, tough as leather! 30 mins. later another one came and it was cooked perfect.  But, still very tough. Cheap grade of beef !! My friend ordered Clams and Linguine. Surprise she got 1/2 cup of pasta & 3 clams in a big bowl that was so super salty she couldn't eat it.  That was sent back too.  The waiter suggested she try the Octopus instead. That was interesting when it came to the table there were 5 tiny round pieces the size of a quarter, weird sauce and 1/2 cup of cooked green lettuce in the center. Again not-edible.. Next  came the no taste Osso Buco ( from a crock pot) and the grand finale was my husbands so called Lasagna. There were about 6 bites hidden under  2 inches of melted cheese on the top. What a total waste of money almost $ 200 for only 4 so called dinners ( we did not order drinks or anything else).  Talk about feeling ripped off! I have never written a review before but, I really feel that if you are considering trying to have dinner here DON'T do it.",

They give a basket of really good garlic bread..i loved it because i like garlic but for those of you who dont..beware it has a lot of garlic chunks.  The pastas were good. Not bad...but pricey considering pasta cost nothing to make at home...which i did this week.  I was able recreate the Melrose add chicken and shrimp and made it better.  Overall...it was good. The Oreo Tartufa was ridiculous.  Id go back just for that!!!",

    "text": "The new building and space is very nice, the food delicious, however the service left something to be desired. My friend and I recently had lunch and were treated with a warm welcome, however the more time we spent the more the team seemed to be confused about who should be doing what, we had 4 different people serve us and not in a timely manner in the end we asked for a dessert menu and decided not, not knowing how long it would take to get desert. Then being in the event industry we asked to see the event space upstairs, a young lady from the hostess desk showed us the space and was very curtious in the beginning however then forgot about us in the end with no warm goodbye wishes she just walked away. I haven't been to Nora's for a little awhile and the first time to the new building-maybe they are trying to get used to their new space. Wont be rushing back, a little disappointed. Especially since I recently recommend to someone based on previous experience.",

Absolutely the best Chicken Marsala - but ask for no marinara on the side pasta, that way you can mix the pasta with the chicken. I love this restaurant. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",

I was able to try a lot of different menu items since it was a large party and they served us pre selected random dishes.   The antipasta salad, so delicous!!! I would say the best I've had anywhere. All the yummy meats and cheese with a great dressing.  Next we had Eggplant parmesan, so good and the best dish was the Baked Ziti. I never ever order this at a restaraunt but I've been in search of one as amazing as Nora's ever since. I thought I had been missing out on this dish for years but nope just the one at Nora's. Last but not least, dessert was served tiramisu and canolis. The canoli was amazing! I definitely recommend this restaraunt and will probably be back every trip I make to Vegas.",

    "text": "I wish I could star-rate a restaurants food, service, ambiance, etc, as individual parts of the whole experience. The ability to do this would drastically affect this review of Nora's.  The food tonight was good. Not excellent, but it had some high points (gnocci w/ vodka sauce, veal scallopinni). However, other items lacked flavor, or in the case of the chicken parm, fell apart all together.   The hostess and bar staff were great. They handled the dinner crowd very well. We had a drink while waiting for our table. Once it was ready we were promptly transferred to the dining room. This is where things went down hill fast. Our server was waiting on my wife and I, a party of 16, and 3-4 other tables. We noticed she had a busser (Justin) and 2 other food runners helping her with the party. All this assistance should have freed her up to provide atleast a bit of competent service to our table and those around us. In the hour and twenty minutes we were in the dining room we interacted with our waitress 4 times.  1. Placed order for 1st cocktails, appetizers, entrees. 2. Delivered 1st cocktails, ordered waters 3. Ordered 2nd cocktail because we hadn't recieved food. 4. Recieved check.   Notice it wasn't our server who delivered our second drink or our FOOD!!! She didn't approach our table until we requested our check through the busser. When she did approach the table she asked how everything was tasting. There were no plates on the table because we has finished our dinner 10 minutes before.  My wife and I have no idea what she was doing the whole time we were there. Her large party seemed to be cared for mainly by support staff such as the food runners and the busser.  Unfortunately I cannot rate the individual parts of this establishment separately, so they receive 2 stars based on the dismal performance of our server and lackluster food.  However Justin the busboy is a 5 star employee. He never stopped moving. He turned tables with absolute efficiency and was incredibly professional in dealing with the customers. We observed him distributing  plates and flatware to the large party. Everyone was handed items individually, with an excuse me and thank you when he had to reach the opposite side of the table. We laughed when we observed another employee simply walk up and place a handful of forks and a stack of plates at the end of the table, and walk away just expecting the head of the table to pass them out. Fantastic job tonight Justin, we appreciated your effort.",

If you haven't stopped in Nora's yet or if you live in the area and haven't had takeout yet... make sure you do.",

    "text": "I found out about this place way back in 2003. I'm a huge fan of Italian food so when my husband and I got married in Las Vegas I asked the locals where the best Italian Restaurant was and they named Nora's. Our first dining experience there was in 11/03, we live in California and every chance we get to go to Las Vegas, we always make it a point to have lunch or dinner at Nora's. One year we took a trip to Texas to buy a car, so when we planned our route back to California, we stopped in town for dinner, since it was during the holiday season, Nora's wasn't open on the day we went so we stayed the night in Las Vegas just so that we could dine at Nora's the next day, that's how big a fan we are!  I have become adventurous and have tried many items on their menu, it never disappoints. This past August we took our 6-year-old super picky eater to dine at Nora's. She still talks about it today, her cheese pizza with pesto sauce was the best she's ever had. My only wish is that I either lived in Las Vegas or that Nora's would move to California",

    "text": "First time dining with Nora's. Boyfriend made a reservation for 2 at 8pm. We arrive and place was packed! But we experienced no problem with our reservation and was sat to our table right away.  Items we ordered were: -Sangria was good but not memorable. (Awesome that you get a free sangria with yelp check in). -Complimentary garlic bread was soooooo goooood!! Hot fresh crispy yet soft bread lightly buttered and seasoned with fresh bits of garlic. Very addicting. -Caesar salad was good but I've had better. Greens were bright green and crisp. Fresh baked homemade croutons as well as pieces of garlic bread. Dressing wasn't too heavy on salad. Just tossed perfect. -Calamari was okay to me but the sauce it was accompanied with was good.  -Cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. Generous portioned Raviolis were nice and fluffy. Tender when cut. Vodka sauce was full of flavor. -meatballs were an option to add to your pasta dish or as a side. They were delicious and tender as well.  -Oreo Tartufo as dessert. It was pretty much an Oreo ice cream chocolate truffle ball. Was a little hard to cut into as first. Might want to wait till it melts a bit more. It was alright, nothing spectacular.  As far as service goes, it was excellent!! Our server had a smile on his face from start to finish of service and was very friendly. All staff seemed friendly, even a couple of the chefs gave us a warm smile on the way out.   A place with smiling faces and warm welcomes as well as great food is a \"go to\" in my book! Will be back soon to try other items!",

When I say fresh, I mean you can actually watch them make it in the kitchen when you walk in.  Second, the sauce is good, which is always important.  The spaghetti, Tomato & Basil, and my Veal Parm all were good because of the gravy.  In top off that, my veal was tender.  Finally, my wife had the Crazy Alfredo, which apparently was the highlight of dinner.  She talked about it all night.  I was happy with the service too.  Our waiter was patient with me taking time with the wine order.   I was also happy they took our leftovers and boxed then up for us, which is always a plus.  Will definitely be going back.",
