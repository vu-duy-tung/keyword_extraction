He took his time with me and explained the menu.  The meal was fresh and good.  They topped the tacos off with a rockin flavored cabbage.  As I mentioned before, they offer other proteins like carnitas, chicken, Carne Asada and (of course) fish.  They also offer them all in a taco, burrito and in a combination plate.  I'll be back..",

We went primarily for the fish tacos, and they were just ok. The two biggest issues that we had that warranted only two stars is first, they charge for their salsa! What? You have to tell them what salsas you want when ordering and they charge for them!  Really?! How do you serve Mexican food and CHARGE for salsa!?!? That seemed Crazy to us! The second issue was minor but annoying, we ordered a kids meal and the cup they gave us for the kids meal didn't have a lid to fit it! The adult cups had lids! Needless to say, we had a couple spills...and you have to ask for napkins, ugh!",

We are regulars of Wahoos and I wanted Paul to know that this is the kind of poor service that is being given here when Victor is not around.  From the beginning when we were placing our order, the cashier seemed indifferent and wasn't personable at all like Wahoos employees normally are.  Shortly after, the same girl brought our chips and salsa.  My Dad clearly asked for two pico salsas and some Cholula hot sauce.  The girl came back with one pico salsa and an empty bottle of Cholula.  When I approached her and asked for another bottle that actually had some in it she gave an attitude.  Shortly after, she dropped the empty bottle and it shattered all over the floor.  Another girl that worked there finally brought a second pico salsa after asking again for it.  The food was served by this other girl as well who seemed to have talked to the other girl as she also had a bit of an attitude and the food was served lukewarm.  Really ruined the whole experience so much that my Dad who loves Wahoos said he probably won't go back to this location as this has happened once before to him at the same spot.  My wife and I have experienced the same problems here but it had improved greatly since Victor was brought in to this location to get it squared away.  Every time we eat here and Victor is working, it is nothing but a positive experience.  I wish I could give the girls name who had such an attitude and gave such poor service but of course she wasn't wearing a name tag (imagine that).  I can say that she had blonde hair and wore a low cut t shirt and short shorts and worked on July 6th.  Have to give a big thumbs down to her and her poor attitude and say that I will be hesitant to go back here unless I know Victor is working!  Need to clean house on some of these employees that want to just show up and get their paycheck without any care for the customer experience!!!",

Liked the selection of some of the drink choices.  I had the shrimp bowl with white rice.  It was good, the shrimp was tasty.  It was a little bland for me.  It would be nice a salsa bar, but the wait staff brought me some mild salsa.  My boss ordered a fish taco/enchilado combo which they messed up the order and brought him two tacos.  He didn't return it and just ate it.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was good.  I will try it again and see how I like it.  I did like what I had and love the fact that someone finally took this spot and I hope they can get things figured out.  We need better choices to dine in the 89002/89015 area.",

We walk though the doors and overhear and Taking Back Sunday playing on the radio.  That made me super excited.  The decor is cool with a skate/surf socal vibe.  The line was out the door which I expected from a newly opened business.  We decided to sit  in the bar area to avoid the line, but no one was paying attention and we didn't get any type of recognition for about 15 minutes.  Not even a glass of water or a, \"We'll be right with you\".  Finally, a server noticed us and took our orders.  We got our food and it was delicious, but the wait was pretty disheartening.  With more time, though, I think they'll work out the kinks.",

Have been here twice- both times it took awhile to get to the front of the line to order & both times our food came 30 minutes after ordering. The food was decent- chips & salsa were kind of disappointing. Spicy chicken enchiladas with spicy green sauce were delicious & my husband's burrito could feed 2. Portions were huge! Had to flag down cocktail server to order $2 ice cold beers- love that! I really want this place to do well- get an additional cocktail server & deliver the food a little faster & things would be greatly improved. Wish you could just order bottled beer @ the register! I could see this place doing great if they can work out a few kinks.",

    "text": "When I was a college student at UC Irvine, my wife (then girlfriendat the time) and I loved to go to any of the 3 Wahoos locations we lived near. I always went with the Kahuna grande - a fish taco, three tasty taquitos (chicken, pork, beef or fish, my fav). Fast forward about 15 years and about 500 miles and the legit surfer grub we used to nosh on has found its way to the desert! I was so stoked when the Westside Rainbow location opened up, but to be completely honest, that location felt like any other Vegas bar and grill. The new Horizon Ridge location, however, delivers all the origibal tastes, vibe and ambience of good ol' Irvine and Newport Beach digs. For a second I felt like I was a twenty year-old in college again until my old man belly knocked my salsa over...haha its a little far for me, but I was told the GV location opens in 6 months! SWEET!",

I sat in the bar & was excited about getting a free meal (as I mentioned to the bartender) and he said the app offer is for California only. Huh?  But he said he'd give it to me. Yay! The offer is a taco or enchilada with beans 'n rice. I had the fish enchilada & it was very good. The hot sauce I added to it was a nice complement.   The bar was smoky the few times I've been here before, and I almost lucked out this time as it was smoke free when I arrived. Alas, this was not to be for long, sadly. I have their player's club card and they have Ultimate X at the bar, 5 cent minimum, so that is a plus. The view is outstanding too, as it overlooks the Strip.  I've had a few meals here and have liked everything, especially the spicy bowl which you can get with any protein. I had it with shrimp and it's tasty. It's fresh, quality food.",

I'm not a price sensitive diner in the absolute sense, but every time I eat here I never feel I get my monies worth.  The food is somewhere between below or at average.  You'd think with \"Fish Tacos\" in the name that would at least be excellent...but no, not excellent, just average - at best.  I'd estimate it is a management/employee problem, but the issues may run deeper to the corporate level, whereby the process and controls are not in place to be able to deliver an excellent meal.",

We are fans for life! I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! We are dying over here for good restaurants. We'd eat a heck of a lot more Wahoos if there was one closer to us. I know lots of my neighbor peeps who would frequent regularly and who think Horizon is too far of a drive...(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!).

If you are more of a no-tortilla person, you can also go with the bowls which provide you more bang for your buck (in my opinion). The carnitas tacos are pretty good too, but eat them promptly, or they turn soggy.  The service is that of a quick service Restaraunt. It's nothing to write home about, but the employees are nice enough. If you ask for something, and they aren't busy, they are pretty on top of it.

After asking numerous times for them to switch the channel to the game (in which they agreed to multiple times that they would), they simply kept putting it off, despite us being the only customers in the room on a Saturday afternoon. The channel never got changed despite being there over an hour. This place has fallen big time from when it first opened. I was so excited for it to move closer to me, but now I don't know if we're going to ever go back.",

    "text": "Went here with my wife recently and I will never return! Let me say that the fish tacos were great! The reason for my 1 star review is because of the bar! The day we went it was around 110 outside and when I order our food I try to order 2 blended Margaritas and the guy at the restaurant counter said that they weren't on his pos menu but I could go to the bar and order directly. A little annoying but no biggie,here's where it all goes wrong....... I walk into the bar which is separated from the restaurant by glass as people can smoke at the bar which is ok with me. The problem is when I try to order blended margaritas, the female bartender says to me \"We aren't that kind of bar! We don't use blenders!\"  Well I've been bartending for 20 years and if a restaurant that features fish tacos with a full bar doesn't make blended drinks it means either 1 The bartenders are lazy or 2 the owner is lazy! It takes maybe an extra 20 seconds to make any blended drink! In the desert in summer time at a beach themed fish place,you sure as hell oughta be able to get a freakin blended drink! Get it together!",

In checking my receipt it only said no beans.  The veggies had teriyaki sauce, which I do not like at all. The menu board was new since last time and had no info on teriyaki sauce, so I didn't think about it. Ate the fish and veggies having to pick thru the rice to find it, was hungry. The server/cashier came over and asked how it was. I explained to her I can't stand teriyaki, I told her I'd rather drink battery acid, just to sweet for me. She told me that the banzai vegetables come with teriyaki. As I'd eaten many times before I'm normally fairly specific on my food prep. I'll take the blame on the teriyaki. The server/cashier offered to get something else for me. I said no my fault for not being more specific. Near the bathroom and throughout the restaurant sewer gas odor. I remember that smell from my last visit several months ago.",

This only consisted of two pieces of square fish, obviously frozen fish patties made from mush, white rice, and black beans. Zero flavor.

I ordered the Maui bowl (steak, rice, & beans.) my fiancee ordered the chicken Maui bowl. I ordered extra teriyaki sauce in case it needed it. When I went to pick it up, the girl at the register was nice but the guy (teenager) who took my order smarted off to me when I asked for more teriyaki sauce. (Just so you employees of wahoos know, the customers can HEAR what you're saying in the kitchen.) Lol *SMH* anyway, when I checked the food this is what I got... (See pic) the steak was dry, plain, and NOTHING I would even pay for. Once I saw the food I asked for MORE teriyaki because I KNEW it would need it! The rice was hard. Not like uncooked hard, more like it'd been sitting out-kinda hard. I was so hungry I didn't care tho I didn't eat very much of it & my fiancees was the same only he said the chicken tasted better than the steak. I've been to wahoos in the day, the vibe is so different and the service is much better. I wonder if the Maui bowl would've been better too but I know I'm not ordering it again! Still love the fish tacos & ONLY ordering that AND only in the day when day staff is there!",

Brianna welcomed us and suggested a really good menu item that we'd never seen before; a shredder sandwich. Two of my friends ended up getting it, one mild and one spicy. And let me say, I'm pretty jealous I didn't get it.( flavorful and it came with churro chips! UGH ) but it's okay, I was all about my burrito! (Get the burritos \"wet\", meaning enchilada style smothered with cheese and your choice or green/red sauce :)   Also, Brianna was awesome; patient with us and offered pretty good selections. Normally the service is pretty inconsistent, so it was awesome that we got a good one up front. Thanks, Brianna!",

I had traditional fish tacos, which were flaky and crispy. Can't go wrong with those.  We also got the teriyaki carnitas bowl with rice and beans and that was amazing! The pork was tender and the sauce was fantastic. I hope they expand to offering more of the flavor featured on the carnitas because it was great. The staff was friendly and checked on our table several times. Not sure what the service issues were for other customers but we had a great experience.",

Ordered 2 burritos one the citrus slaw the other the bonzai both were huge when we got them home.   Had them served wet with green sauce I for sure recommend doing that instead of dry it just locks in so much flavor!    The bonzai burrito had spicy chicken and for one of the first meals in a long time I didn't feel like it was lacking heat.   It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The citrus slaw was ordered with shrimp and each bite was super tasty.  Not to overpowering on citrus.  The only negative we found was it was a task to cut through the burritos because they were so large.  Not a bad problem to have!",

One concern I had was the black beans in my Banzai Bowl was pretty much a closed scoop where it also brought a lake of bean juice.  Made the bowl really soggy.  Still tasted good and flavorful.  Dining area is also very surfer dude style with stickers everywhere, decor displaying surfing, bmx, snowboarders.  Tables made it feel like you were looking at the used record section at Rasputin's (no two tables had the same design).  Overall a pleasant experience.  Will have to come back and try other options.  Bonus:  checking in gets you a free chips and salsa with the purchase of 2 full entrees and 2 drinks.",

We sat in one of the booths- and found a dirty fork left on the table. We overlooked that and waited in anticipation of our $24.00 meal for 2.  Unfortunately we were let down. The tacos were so small with one piece of frozen overcooked fish. The rice was instant white rice and the beans were exactly like they were from a can of Pork and Beans.  The \"homemade salsa\" is not even homemade. Ask for the red sauce. It is made with bottled BBQ sauce. Staff are sitting down and laughing as if no customers were in there.  Save your money and time, drive somewhere else. I would not be surprised if this place is out of business by the end of the year.",

My wife and I ordered taquitos and a burrito.  After having ordered and paid, we were informed that the taquitos were going to take an additional 15 minutes because something in the kitchen was being cleaned. I was done eating my burrito before my wife received her meal.   The food was average and the service somewhat substandard. Not really worth the $23+ we spent.  I could have been much less dissatisfied if there was not an individual in the bar smoking cigarettes! The signs on the outside of the bar, on the doors, clearly said \"non-smoking\" area! But, there he was puffing away. And it was obvious by his interaction with the bartender that he was a \"regular.\"   We did not want to complain because we were nearing the end of our visit, and had no plans to return anyway!  Sorry that we do not have anything positive to say. And because there are numerous restaurants in the area that serve similar food, we will not be back!",

The menu is pretty simple to choose from and lists the proteins you can choose from. Not just fish the have chicken and steak. Me and my mom both decided on the 2 taco plate with rice and beans. I got one fish and one chicken both Cajun with Cajun beans and white rice. Mom had two fish tacos white rice and black beans.  The place was dead and I should've taken the hint. The food is just whatever. The fish was pretty bland and the chicken nothing Cajun about it. The white rice they served was old and crunchy. Beans had a good spice to them but the only thing that saved this dish was the slaw on top the tacos. It had a citrus dressing to it and was refreshing. It was supposed to be on the side instead of the black beans on my moms plate but I guess the cashier didn't pay attention. The view from the bar area would be nice at night because you can see almost the entire valley including the strip but that would be all I came back here for if I ever didn't decide to have a drink here but it probably won't happen. You can get better fish tacos at del taco.",

As you always say, you bring out the best attitude on the first day, and the impression will stay with everyone from day one.   Great job Wahoo management team for bring this to the front line on the first day!   There is two section to Wahoo, the general restaurant, and the bar which has a great view of the Las vegas strip.  In fact, FOX 5 news crew does use the side of this building as a backdrop for a lot of general news segments.  Yeah, it's that great of a view of Las Vegas valley  The food is good, and has a very interesting twist with the cajun beans, and  Maui sweet onion rings are damn good.   Also,  the tacos are kind of similar to Chef Ellman's Maui Tacos, but still like the other place next door just a little bit a little more for tacos, but it 's atmosphere and employees that will win people over.    I like the choices here, and the brown rice option is great for my family, but I'm still a white rice eating dude.    Nice restaurant Wahoo, and will be back soon.",

Brown rice was done right and their Cajun beans were not bad at all. Of course everything was kicked up a notch when I squeezed my lime wedge on everything. Everything came as expected and enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area. Look forward to come back in the near future and patronize their full service bar.

    "text": "I am kind of on the fence about Wahoo's.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere is chill, and the food was delicious....  But, I wasn't entirely happy with all of the options.  I am not a food snob - I will be the first to admit that I love Rubio's.  Are they the best fish tacos in the world? No, probably not.  But they are decently priced, quick and pretty darn delicious.  Enough about Rubios, I know this is a review about Wahoo's Fish Tacos.  The set up of the restaurant is kind of strange.  As soon as you walk in the door, there is a wall with the menu on it.  The register is to the left and the restaurant is to the right.  Maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but I've never been to Wahoo's before, and I saw servers walking around checking on tables, so I wasn't totally sure if we were supposed to order at the counter or sit down and wait for someone to assist us.  So, we walked up to the counter, where we waited. And waited. And waited, because the people in front of us were also new and had NO idea what they wanted (not their fault, but I assume that's what the menu at the door is for, so you can decide BEFORE trying to order).  Eventually another cashier came to help us, and we were on our way.  We both had the combo platter #2 (choice betweent 2 tacos or 2 enchiladas, with rice and beans).  I had the 2 taco combo, with 1 fish taco (cajun style) and 1 carne asada taco, brown rice (great option!) and black beans.  My Mom had the 2 enchilada platter (cheese enchiladas) with brown rice and black beans.  Now, I understand that this is supposed to be a healthier alternative, but I REALLY like baja style fish tacos, and was disappointed that this wasn't even an option.  The fish taco was pretty decent, even if it wasn't baja style.  The carne asada wasn't my favorite.  The meat was tender, but a bit dry, and the taco was WAY overfilled with ingredients (the least of them meat), which made it very difficult to eat.  The beans and rice were really the highlight of the meal.  I love brown rice, and the beans mixed together perfectly with it.  The enchiladas on my Mom's plate were seriously some of the cheesiest and best I'd ever tasted.  I mean, they were stuffed with and covered with tons of cheese.  I was surprised.  We didn't go in the bar area, but I would definitely like to come back and check it out sometime.  They had drink menus on the tables, and it looked like they have a decent selection of beers and some interesting signature cocktails.  Overall, we had an OK experience at Wahoo's.  I like that the food is served on real plates with real silverware, and that there are servers checking on you.  I will probably visit again to try some of their other items.  But I will stick to the REAL taco shops for my carne asada.",

The bartenders are friendly and great with their service.  But my husband and I didn't really like the food.  Their chicken quesidilla was good (hard to mess up) and the bean burritos were good (another hard thing to mess up).  But the carne asada was some of the worst meat I've ever had!  The meat was tough and had no flavor.  The grilled fish tacos were OK....not spectacular like I expected from a place that is known for their fish tacos. Happy hour is from 3-7 and they have specials on beer and appetizers.  It's definitely worth checking out.",

The food is awesome, the drinks are plentiful and the staff is very friendly.  We used to stop at this place on Rainbow & 215 and it is great that they finally have one on this side of town.  If you have never been, you need to go.  The food is great, the prices are right and they also have gaming and a bar for the drinkers and players.  This place is a must to try at least twice....",

    "text": "Pretty decent food. The ordering process is a little daunting tho, lots of things to look at & chose from & imo, instead of ordering at the counter & then sitting, it would be better to sit & order from a waiter/waitress so there's time to really look over the menu without feeling rushed or like you're holding up the line. The guy we ordered from also wasn't particularly patient or great about answering some q's we had about some of the menu items.  I ordered the fish tacos, 1 of them with the cabbage slaw, the other regular. Hubby & son got carne asada burritos & our other son got the carnitas bowl.  My tacos were really good, lots of fish on each one. I def preferred the cabbage slaw topped one. We got a few of their sauces to try & I really loved the green sauce & some sort of spicy red sauce that they bill as being super spicy. It wasn't that spicy, but had lots of great flavor. The rice was bland so it was nice to have some sauces to mix in.  The burritos were ok, nothing special but the carne asada had good flavor. The carnitas was done with some sort of sweet marinade which my son was not thrilled with.  Overall, our meal was good & now that we've been once, hopefully it'll be a more streamlined ordering process next time!",

The last visit I decided to try something different and got their taco salad (it's called something else on the menu that I cannot remember.)  The taco salad was meh. I ordered with tofu as I am a vegetarian weening his way back to meat. Next time I will stick with what's good to me and that's the burritos, only this time with chicken.  Great place to grab a bite and don't let the name fool you, they do more than just fish. And it makes for a great spot to catch sports.

    "text": "I was surprised when I checked out Yelp for a place to eat and saw this Wahoo's Fish Taco.  I'm used to seeing them in San Diego and LA by the beach.  Well, I decided to check it out.  After reading the huge mix of reviews on here, I had a feeling it was going to be a hit of miss.  First off, the residents in the area are not Wahoo's type of surfers and skateboarders customers, but people who are retired.  It was just kinda weird sitting there listening to punk rock with a lot of gray hair around me who have no idea what band is playing.  So aside from that, to the food, it took almost 20 minutes for my burrito! Seriously unacceptable for one item with only two other tables dining.  It came out nice and hot.  As for the spicy fish, I wish I would of got another protein, as it had a \"fishy\" taste to it I didn't like, but the vegetables and the rest of the burrito were good.  There was only 1 cashier / waitress working, so after I finished my beer while waiting for my food, I had to go back to cashier to order another one.  It was Wahoo's, but not really what I would expect from a Wahoo's I have been to in CA.  Wasn't really feeling it, after I eat Wahoo's I want to see the ocean, listen to waves crashing, see people riding bikes around, etc.  3 stars for a overall, OK.",

But the Wahoo's has been here for a little while, and let me tell you, I am quite glad it has!   Does henderson lack a decent Mexican restaurant? No. But trying to find a decently clean late night bar that's not a PT's that also serves some great vegetarian options at a very competitive price can be an exercise in futility.   $3 pacificos all the time. I got the \"Outer Reef\" vegetarian burrito, which, for ~$5 was very satisfactory. I'd get it again, but I'd probably ask for less rice and more beans. The view at night is wonderful as well! The addition of outdoor seating and a few couches around a fire really make for a pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend!",

I really enjoyed it! And when I was done he gave me a couple of coupons to come back, and some boxes to bring my food home. Very nice people.",

    "text": "Won't be bringing my business back to this Wahoo's and I LOVE Wahoo's. I'll gladly drive to Boca Park.  This is the closest of the three valley locations to me, but I'll make the trek to avoid this location.  My food at this location has generally always been subpar compared to other Wahoo's, but this time my incorrect order PLUS the rudest bartender I have ever met in my life did the deed of hammering the final nail into the casket.   To be clear: I, as a Las Vegan, know and understand the gamers always have priority seating at machines at the bar and always keep that in mind when choosing to sit at the bar.  We walk in. We sit at the bar.  Now, my date and I asked the bar tender to break a $20 for us. We both took $10 of this and began to gamble. We ordered drinks, we ordered food. A couple regular parties walk in. There are 4 empty seats with machines available, but we get the looks. We are sitting at their precious normal machines.  This bartender had the NERVE to tell my boyfriend and me that she will move us if she has to because the machines are \"reserved for active players.\" Am I not actively gambling? I have pushed this button non-stop since I have sat down. So while my man and I secretly discussed our shock under our breath, she noticed. She came over AGAIN and like a stern mother scolding her children she took a tone with us and repeated herself, all while I STILL count FOUR empty machines in the bar. We are the only people with food, drinks, AND actively gaming. Clearly, our 25 cent Keno wasn't going to win her the high tips she would get when the professional bar gamblers hit their flushes and royals.  I am so livid that were blatantly treated like lower class for a higher paying regular gambler. I am not looking for free drinks while sitting at the bar, I am looking for a little gaming fun and to pass the time.  I'll eat and Twin Peaks before returning here.",

    "text": "I'd prefer to give it a 2.5 rather than just a 2 or 3, but because I didn't give them the chance to correct the issue, I'll give them a 3.    Stopped by for the first time on a recent Saturday at 11AM.  There were only a couple customers.  I ordered a burrito, asking for it \"wet\" and with guacamole & sour cream, plus a side of onion rings, and a drink, paid for everything then took my seat after using the self-serve drink station.     The burrito arrived pretty quickly, and *tasted great.*  But unless I misunderstood how they do it, it was just the burrito & some rice & beans on the side -- no red sauce, no guacamole, no sour cream (all of which I was charged extra for).   Nor did the onion ring appetizer ever show up.  The order taker clearly heard my order those options, as we discussed them a little, and I was charged for them.   Obviously I could & should have follow-up when I received the burrito, and I expect they would have resolved the issue.  I was there with some friends and we were kind of in a hurry, the burrito was good as it was, so I didn't bring up the issue.    Adding up the flavor & price, it was good, *but* since I'm not into fish tacos, I'm able to get equally good food at a much better price by going to Chipotle instead.   If friends want to go back to Wahoo's, I won't hesitate at all (though I'll be sure to get everything I ordered & paid for), but otherwise, when I'm wanting a nice burrito, I'll go back to Chipotle, or try some new place instead.  The manager was very friendly, greeting everyone and making the rounds to ensure people were happy, so while they have no excuse for not delivering all the food I ordered/paid for, I have no excuse for not making them aware of the issue.",

I ordered a salad and was given the option to chose my protein. I was glad to see that tofu was one of them. My hubby ordered three tacos and they also had the option to choose three different proteins for each.   The food was good and my salad portion was hearty. The salad I ordered came with corn, black beans, mixed greens, tortilla chips and tofu. Everything was flavored well and there wants any need to additional dressing.    Effie coming here I would recommend looking for specials and coupons. I got one on the mail for a free entree. I know they advertise in a couple of places so it shouldn't be too hard to find a deal.",

    "text": "Quirky mix of Mexican/Brazilian with an island twist on the menu here. From classic burritos to a Kalua Pig bowl. I was happy to see Tofu, veggies, mushrooms and  vegetarian fillings as part of your options when you go to make your meal.  First impression didn't really start off on the right foot though. We walked in and didn't know if we were supposed to order or wait to be seated. Walked around to the cashier working behind the counter and stood there till we were able to catch her attention and ask for help.  That's when another employee came out from the back and walked us back to the entryway and walked us thru the menu. From there all staff was helpful and friendly throughout our visit.   I ended up picking the taco/burrito combo. My choice fillings were Tofu and Shrimp.  Both had a polynesian marinade.  It's like shoyu with pineapple juice.  It was sweet and went well on the fillings I had.  I didn't really like the shrimp though.  Too rubbery texture for me. Portion wise, it was adequate and prices are reasonable most combos were under $10 .  Combo platter came with beans and/or rice too. The cajun style beans wasn't too spicy .  Also our server offered both red and green sauces for our dishes. The green sauce was what I remember most. Creamy but light, fresh, and just slightly spicy.  Cilantro was prominent ingredient in it. I asked our server what else was used and was informed fat free mayo! Nice! They stick to the theme of healthier and fresh foods.  Atmosphere, well once you get past the narrow entryway where everyone crowds around to read the menu (hence the line out the door) it's bright and airy.  The dining area is beach themed and the vibe is pretty chill and laid back. Seating  in main dining area has booths lining one wall, several tables everywhere else. It's family friendly . The bar is in a separate area which has the partial view of the valley. It's a nice set up. I'll more than likely be back in this part of the restaurant since my neighbor friends are bar flies and like to just hang out for drinks and appys for happy hour or for a light lunch in the main dining area. That's about it.",

Roberto's makes it with a red sauce  BARF WTF?!?! Wahoo's does it right with a dope white/verde creme sauce. So bomb! The manager/owner also hooked us up with free churro chips and brought water out for our 2 dogs   on the porch. Wahoo's is GOOD AF!!!",

Sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to ask our drink order, etc. He looked at us several times but never said a word to us. He just continued helping other people. They weren't crazy busy...in fact there were several seats open. He didn't even look over to tell us he would be with us shortly...nothing. We sat for 15 minutes and still nothing. We finally got up and left. As we were walking out he just looked at us. We weren't rude nor did we do anything that would justify such horrible service? We took our business elsewhere.  So frustrating. I've never been ignored at a restaurant with out a reason in my life. Even the busiest of places at least tell you they are busy and will be with you as soon as they can.  Wahoos will not be getting anymore of my money. Ever.  Big time fail.",

I am so glad this location was in the same complex . I am hooked now and even told my hubby how fresh and great the food was and he had a lot of choices to choose from sense he can eat anything .   I will be back for sure . Employees were super amazing and personable. I am so thankful it is only eight minutes at the most from home too . Hours are great and prices are good for fresh food made to order . I took my to go but they also have a bar area and they have a dine in with drink options I saw .

I've been to a couple Wahoo's in SoCal, so when I was working right around the corner I thought I'd slide over for a late lunch. I previously ordered Mr. Lee's Screamin' Burrito (a yummy blend of cheeses, chicken, and mushrooms all topped off with this super-spicy green sauce). I walk into the place (after walking through the bar... Weird?) and end up starring the chef/lone server in the face... I'm in the kitchen! I ask where we order (I should have asked if they needed help cooking, but not my day to stand at the grill and sling-it). I order up, and this is where it gets even weirder... The lone server is trying to upsell me everything! I can handle a good sales presentation, but it's as if because no one (did I mention not a sole is in this place?) is here that they have to make up all the days ticket sales on me! Just my burrito please...  Burrito comes out pretty fast (there's no orders ahead of me, so why shouldn't it?) It's got great flavors, but nothing close to the screamin' burritos of SoCal. I eat the inside and ditch.  I start reading the reviews prior to this post and wish I had read them before my visit... I'd have gone somewhere else! All said and done, I'm in/out in 12-minutes.  PS-Another review says that they'd be surprised if they stay open for a year. Not certain what could make it last that long!",

He was friendly, helpful, and appeared to love his job. It was our first time and he was patient and gave good recommendations.   The variety of 7 different hot sauces was a pleasant surprise. Especially because I found my new favorite hot sauce.   Kids eat free on Thursday. The place was vibrant and bustling. My son said that we will return and I agree.",

I get mine with the black beans and brown rice. So filling! Sorry, I forgot to take a pic. I was hungry    I used to work in Costa Mesa and the Wahoo's near my office had a line 20 deep everyday. I'm guessing people just don't know yet but highly recommended. The people are very nice and attentive with generous smiles wanting to make sure everything is good. The bathrooms are clean, a sign of a good establishment.   If you've not dined at a Wahoo's you must give it a go. Everyone has their opinions but in 21 years of eating Wahoo's  I have never had a bad meal or experience.   Love me some Wahoo's",

Sadly, several things have been pretty bad (awful guacamole - like out of a can and brown)  I do like the 1988 fish taco with the fried fish - rather than grilled. Really wish that they had refried beans as a side option, rather than the black beans (plain) and the Cajun beans (Mexicajun?? Not into it.)  The best thing here is happy hour at the bar; especially if you like Pacifico beer. Good deals and decent options. But it can be smoky.",

Inside the restaurant and outside on the patio there is plenty of seating. They even have a separate bar with a full drink menu and gaming. The vibe in the restaurant is designed to feel like a beachside hangout.   The menu offers a nice selection of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, salads, and bowls. There were plates with the option for one or two enchiladas. Sides offered a choice of a couple of types of rice and a couple of bean types. Each meal is available with a protein and there are about half a dozen meat and non-meat options.   My enchilada meal was good, I liked both the red and green sauce. The rice and beans were okay. My husband enjoyed his burrito too. We also ordered chips and salsa that were good. I'd say none of the food was the best I've ever had, but it was inexpensive and a fast option.",

The food is decent but I wouldn't go here unless you call in an order 40 minutes out and also always check that everything is in the bag, they love to charge for sauces that they don't give you. Also I only ever see staff just sitting down and eating and joking around, just terrible customer service overall and overpriced.",

Took the boy on weekend afternoon. thinking it was not that busy and still had to park behind the mall.  So be it, the lines were not extending out past the door as I had seen in the pervious past couple of days.  I don't know what I was expecting....perhaps, it was something along the lines of a Rubio's but I was wrong.  The menu was tad overwhelming but I settled on a wahoo taco. The boy ordered some sort of steak bowl.  We ordered a Baja Roll (not bad) to start.  I went to the bar to get a beer, stood for about a minute and then returned to my table.  The food arrived and sadly I was not impressed.  Bland would be the word best to describe the taco.  The steak on on boy's bowl tasted microwaved and was also bland.  The best part was the side of beans.  I will say the service was on the up and up.  I must have been visited at least three times while we were eating and asked how the food was.  Sadly, all I could was look up and shrug my shoulders.",

I think next time I'll try an enchilada.   2nd visit tonight. Pacifico still COLD!! I had a chicken burrito wet with red sauce. It was really good. Ordered chips and salsa and the salsa was really really good. A bit spicy for me but very flavorful.  Hubs had a carne asada taco and a shrimp taco. He liked the shrimp taco better. Until next time....",

The girls working were so nice and even brought us the churro chips and apologized again for the trouble!! We will be back!!",

They are super friendly but when it ucomes to giving you service they are way under par. Food is decent and very good priced but after this last time where I had to send back my meal because it was too cold and took forever to even get them to ask us what we wanted to eat, I cannot give them another chance. Also had to constantly flag the bartender down for a new beer. But the final straw was the fact that we gambled about $70 between the 2 of us we only got 2 beers comped. As someone in the service industry and works as a cocktail server and has bartended, I know what the proper comp system is. Had no compensation for having to wait at least 15 min for my new meal as well.. We've had problems the last 2 times as well but tried to give them a chance since they are new (and very close to home) but not after this time. So sad:(",

That being said, this is my second visit to this location and millionth time at a Wahoos. I did go into the bar to get a beer and take it back to my table, but when I got it back into the \"smoke free room\", I noticed after my first taste that the mug was completely cracked at the top. I asked for a bar manager so i didn't have to go back into the smoke and he brought me another beer with an explanation of how the temperature variation from the dishwasher to the freezer can crack a mug. Thanks Mr. Science. (Next beer is on us maybe? PLEEEZE not even an attempt at an offer).   After my food came with my chips and thimble sized salsa, I asked for another salsa so I could finish my chips. (I had tacos too) the girl left, came back and said. \"Oh, salsa is 0.38.\" Really?? 38 cents?? I had such high hopes for this location. Even after I am done eating today I am suppose to order something to bring home to my son. I am honestly going to drive in the complete opposite direction and go to Faustos and get him something. I honestly don't think that this Wahoos will ever get another dime, or 38 cents out of me.",

My friend and I went in the other night to feed our kids and have a cocktail close to home.  Since we had our kids we decided to do them a favor and sit on the patio so we wouldn't disturb the customers inside (keep in mind it was 100 degrees outside too).  The kids had to go to the bathroom once or twice, refill there drinks, they got our order wrong, etc.  All of these required us to go back inside.  We got a very bad attitude from the young hostess and dirty looks, she even TOLD one of my kids to keep the door closed.  Its not our fault when you open your door its stays open.  She could have easily came and closed it or asked in a different way. Seriously the attitude was horrible and then the food came and it was just as bad..  I will say this though, the cheese nachos were good :).  Anyway, I will never return back to this restaurant and don't appreciate the treatment we got, if you have kids and want good food don't waste your time or money going to Wahoos on Horizon!",

When I moved away in 1999, I definitely was jonesing for their delish food. Fast forward to living in Henderson and being stoked when Wahoo's opened up here. I was thrilled when the GVR location was to go in but it's been sidelined for some reason. The next closest location is this one at Horizon Ridge and Horizon and I can say every time I've come it's been like a slice of home...the food is awesome and exactly as it is back home and the service is fantastic. I've been a little sad at this gem becoming \"main stream\" and popping up everywhere but at the same time, I now get to eat the food I love. While the \"roots\" of Wahoo's doesn't translate out to the desert, the overall feel is darn close and I'm stoked to now have this great place in adopted home. Kudos to the staff at this location for making sure at every turn my meal and experience was nothing short of perfect.",

I could deal with that because we had an awesome waitress, Lori. The bar \"Manager\"...an old cranky guy, kept giving me dirty looks because I guess I was blocking the walk way of some servers with where my seat was. He complained to Lori and I gladly moved. I was disturbed by his looks but I let it go but I am very perceptive. About 20 minutes later, all power goes out. We try and pay our tabs with our debit cards since none of us have cash and the machine isn't working. He (mean old bar manager) then says get money out of the ATM there. It of course isn't working. We ask if he would comp our $9 tab and our other friend had $30 cash on a $48 tab. The manager then grabbed the checks crumpled them in his hands and said \"yes fine! Whatever!\" I will never go back to this place. If you don't like your job....find another. Lori was great though. I have no idea about the food...so you are on your own there but service is much more important to me.",

I had a Chicken Bowl and was pretty disappointed to get chicken, beans, and rice.  That's it.  Apparently you have to pay extra if you want anything else.  There was no salsa, sour cream, lettuce, veggies, nothing.  I really don't like when restaurants make you pay for all that extra stuff.  Especially when you're a fast-ish food Mexican restaurant.  At least, I think it's a Mexican restaurant.  It's hard to tell with \"cajun\" beans and Mr. Lee's sauce.  Doesn't make much sense.    Pretty sure I don't need to go back and pay $7.99 for a \"bowl\" with only three things inside it.  But on the plus side they have happy hour from 3-7 for half priced beers.

I was thinking we lucked out when we got there since no one was in line and no one was in the seating area. figured we'd be in and out.....wrong. we sat at our table for over 30 minutes, watched as a few groups came and went with take out and only two groups stayed to eat in. Both groups after us were served before us and when we asked where our food was the waiter said we were next then we saw him and the other waitress shuffling about the tickets at the register. When they finally brought us one plate the girl said there was a mix up from the rush and I asked her how she could tell us it was a rush when there was literally only two other tables being served....she didn't have an answer. If the servers can't handle what was about 5 groups and an empty restaurant, maybe they need to be retrained. it's one thing to lose an order and or to have make a mistake, however flat out lying to your patrons about how busy it was when the place was empty is pretty pathetic. very disappointed in the two servers. The man who was in all black didn't smile and looked like he hated life and the girl with the yellow shirt was just a lair. Good food when it finally came out, but balanced with the servers this place is below par.",

    "text": "Actually more like 2.5 stars .... We arrived on a Saturday early evening. Being somewhat unfamiliar with their menu we stopped at the large menu board posted in the entrance way. The cashier noticed us right away and came over to explain the menu .    Her attitude was a bit overbearing and although she was extremely confident in her knowledge of the menu , it just came off as an \" in your face\" performance not a sincere desire to help guests.  After she spent 5 minutes telling us what she liked. We finally got to order. I had the fish taco combo  which is 2 fish tacos , rice , beans and some chips and salsa.  She asked us what we wanted to drink , she mentioned a bunch of beers and we expressed our desire to get a beer on tap. She informed us that we would have to go to the bar area to order that.  So we finished the food order and went into the bar area to order our drinks . There was a large patio area out side so we chose to sit out there ( the bar was full of smoke and although it is a surfer, ocean themed place it was a typical sports bar on the inside ) very smokey and lots of people yelling at tv screens ....  The food arrived and the appearance and presentation of the food was very good , colorful plate with the food neatly placed and full of bright salsa colors.  I had ordered the Cajun version of the fish taco. It appeared to be lightly battered with a spicy Cajun rub, serves along with some lettuce and salsa on a soft corn tortilla .  It was served with brown rice and black beans , again... Seemed fresh but the flavor was just ok  Biting into it  , the taste was ok, and everything seemed fresh. I kept finding myself adding salt or pepper for flavor....I finally ended up putting more salsa on it.  Honestly for a place with the name \" Fish Tacos\" In it's name you would think that the fish taco would be epic .. But honestly it was just ok.... I was raised in southern Texas and have travelled to California , Mexico , the Caribbean , Hawaii and all over Asia ...I've had tons of different versions of the \" fish taco\" and wahoos is just , well.. It's just ok.  Locally you can get a better fish taco at zabas , or even the American style restaurant Claim Jumper.  Break down of scoring max is 5 pt  Dining area appearance 4 Wait staff 3 Bar area 2 Ticket time 4 Restroom 2 Food taste flavor and presentation 3 Location 2 ( Henderson location)",

    "text": "We went here for an early dinner on a Thursday. Thought we try it out since it's only minutes from our house. The menu was alright, the prices on the food are reasonable. We ordered the shrimp bowl with brown rice with beans & two shrimp tacos with rice and beans as well. We sat down a table with booth seating, and noticed that no one had cleaned off the table. As for the drinks, we had ice water, ordered Corona and the skinny long island ice tea from a waitress who had walked by. When I was about to drink the long island, I noticed a big chip on the inside of my glass. So I waited until another staff member came by and I told her about the glass, she took it from me and returned with a new clean glass & drink. The food was okay in flavor, it wasn't delicious. I don't think we're going to come back...only because a few minutes after we ate, both our stomachs were acting up...it's a sign that the food was not as fresh as it looks. :( The good thing about Wahoo's - the staff members are very friendly and the atmosphere reminds me of Hawaii & Cali.",

They took out golden tee and added slot machines. They said they want the bar to be more gaming so basically screw the locals who drink a shit load and just want a place to hang out. They are also taking out the caseda seating on the patio. I guess it's time to go to another bar. Too bad because this was a great local place to unwind and enjoy some nice company.",

I always get the tacos. I have tried the Spicy Chi, the Citrus Slaw, and the 1984. I can eat like 5 tacos at a time they are so good! I also like to get them in a plate, with Cajun beans and rice. Yum!  The decor is fun. My 3 year old gets stickers everytime we go, and is allowed to put them anywhere she wants on the walls. She loves this. There a separate bar as well.   It's a little expensive, but oh so good. You also get a free plate if you download their app.",

    "text": "Wahoo's is a fast casual chain serving bowls, burritos, tacos, and enchiladas melding Mexican, Brazilian, and Asian flavors. I'll usually get their fish their tacos which they're known for, and they usually don't disappoint. I've had no complaints with service with any of my visits.  The view separates this location from others as you can see both the summit of Black Mountain and you can can also have an unobstructed view of the entire Valley if you choose to sit at the bar or out on the patio weather permitting. The dining area is spacious with plenty of tables and some booths against the wall.  When you order, you have the choice of protein for your dish which includes: chicken, carnitas, carne asada, fish, shrimp, and tofu. The food is OK to me and on par with most taquerias and teriyaki bowl places with their fish tacos being worth return trips for. Everything else is a notch pricier to other establishments but not significantly elevated in flavor. On this particular visit, I had the carne asada Outer Reef Burrito- cheese, lettuce, rice, beans, green sauce with a side of salsa. The steak was flavorful, but I could have done without the lettuce.  If I'm in the vicinity, I'd come back for some fish tacos or maybe to chill out in the bar or out on the patio with cerveza in hand.",

They said the chicken is in the burrito and I told them it is not and we'd gladly return it if they can just send another one or credit us. Manager said we'll take care of it next time. Then he said I should call grub hub and then asked me to come pick it up. Seriously ???? The point to grub hub is to have food delivered to your home. They honestly didn't care.",

My wife was really wanting fish tacos and I had heard nothing but great things, so we chose Wahoo's.  My wife ordered her tacos and I just decided to order a steak quesadilla, because it wasn't that big AND it was only $7.49. I made the order and looked at the review to see that she charged me $9.49. I told her that the menu said $7.49 and her reply was \"I don't know what to tell you. Maybe they raised the prices.\" I told her again, but the menu says it's $7.49. Her reply, \"Sorry.\" She then told me that she could give me some chips and salsa for free, but as she started ringing it up, it came up as $1. I told her that it was charging me an extra dollar and she said, \"Oh well I guess it isn't free.\" I told her I didn't want it and sat down. I will say, the taste of the food HEAVILY outweighed the poor service. The carne asada was cooked to perfection! Could have been one of the best tasting quesadillas I've ever had. Well worth $9.49... even if it wasn't priced correctly.",

The Wahoo Bowl, was just rice a side of black beans and a filet of fish. I expected something a little different and was disappointed by it. Would not order again.  Fish burrito.

With just the right seasoning (and spicy being an option) the fish is tender and light alongside of their citrus slaw. I am NOT an onions fan, so I am so happy that Wahoo's doesn't add them into their slaw! We also love the cajun fries as a side to share when we decide to order different entrees. Their beer and drink selection is a nice bonus, with the possibility of seating on the patio when weather permits.   The service is always prompt and friendly no matter if we are dining in or getting food to go! If only they were closer to our house in the Southeast side of town, then we could really be regulars!",

However, went in for dinner one night and there is a huge difference - evening crew needs some definite customer service training and the food was poor quality as well.  But, the good stuff we love:  Chicken tacos - delicious!  Traditional street taco style, plenty of meat, great sauces (green sauce needs a bit more flavor) Chicken enchilada - my FAVE!  The red sauce is fabulous! The salsa (pico de gallo style) is always fresh and chips have always been fresh and crispy Maui Bowl - very good teriyaki, not oversauced  The not-so-good:  I ordered chicken tortilla soup hoping for a Mexican-style tortilla soup but instead got a bowl of what could have been Progresso chicken noodle with some tortilla strips on top.  No taste, definitely not what I had in mind for \"tortilla soup\" - very disappointing.  The choices of rice and beans is a little weird - plain white or brown rice and either black beans or Cajun beans.  My husband enjoys these options and the portions are generous and always cooked well, but I always opt for ala carte because none of those really appeal to me.  Some of the items are a little pricey - for instance, the Wahoo's Salad is a very bare bones, basic salad for almost $8.  But my ala carte enchilada with chips and salsa for under $5...I could eat that every day.",

I would highly recommend to stop by! $2 Original Tacos are my absolute favorite! Nothing too fancy or too simple, but it's entirely worth it. They come with lime, pico de gallo and an extra tortilla.

We brought it to one of the servers attention and his reply was \"Sorry, let me go let Javier know...\" whom we assumed was a manager of some sort.  We waited another 5-10 minutes before the same server came back and the told us that \"the kitchen\" told him they could make him another or something else.  REALLY?!  We told him we did not want anything else.  He then said \"Oh, okay, well, thanks then, you have a good day...\"  I would AT THE VERY LEAST expect a refund, and we weren't even offered that.  I don't know if \"Javier\" is the manager, or if the manager was ever even notified of the situation.  All I know, is aside from the girls working the register, they do not know how a guest should be treated.  And it's managements fault for not properly training and enforcing appropriate behavior.

We ordered our food, and sat down to wait. Wait we did...after everyone was served (not more than 20 people at lunchtime) and 40 mins later, still no food. I asked a server to check on our order. A few minutes later we were given an extra side of chips, guac and salsa, along with free taco tickets and scratchers of some kind and told that our order was being put on a rush because they had no idea what happened to our order.  Ok thank you for stepping up and giving us the coupons, etc, we appreciated that. Probably will never go back here again. Ended up giving the coupons away since we live no where near this location.",

Also, it was nice to eat out as a family (of 3) for under $30 and know that it's on the healthier side.  For the second time now, this place has been a good night out. I like the vibe and the promptness of the kitchen. You'll definitely see me again!",

We went there after a week of them opening which was probably too soon.   The girl taking the order was very pleasant and she made sure the order was correct. Her trainer was right behind her keeping an eye on her for accuracy.   I had the fish tacos which were good. They kids enjoyed their quesadillas too.  My GF, her meal came out wrong twice. The owner came out and entertained the kids by giving them stickers to stick someplace on the wall. We were waiting for him to say something about the meal being made wrong but he never did. It was pretty busy and everyone was still trying to figure out their jobs with it just opening. Maybe the info didn't get to him, who knows.  We will be back after its been open a while and hopefully have a better experience.",

The time it took is unacceptable and because of that would probably not go back during lunch hours since I generally only have a 30 minute lunch period. When I got my order, it was incorrect; however, at that point I could not send it back to due time constraints and I needed to eat and leave. The food was decent, but not as good as other locations that I have visited.  I would only return if others want to eat there, but not out of personal choice due to the time it took to get the food.",

    "text": "2nd time here was today, first visit was okay, however today was not. The kid working the register, Brady, was friendly and helpful. Once our order was in we had to wait a long time while most of the employees wandered around. The place was basically empty, and a bag was placed on the counter but they never said it was ours and there was no communication between the employees about it, because they were busy having conversations about other things. Once someone realized an order was sitting there a shorter girl brought it over to us and we asked for extra limes. She went back to get them, put them in a container, but on her way back decided to join in on the conversation going on, which included a guy who I'm guessing was a manager since he was in a blue polo. The cashier came over since we were standing there waiting and asked if we needed anything and we told him we were waiting on the girl to bring the limes, so he walked over and grabbed them and brought them to us. Once we got home we got a great surprise that a single taco was placed under the container with an entire meal, which caused the container to leak black bean sauce all over everything in the bag. Then my wife was gifted a piece of fish in her taco that had bones in it. It's really unfortunate that apparently most of the employees don't care about their jobs, customers, or the business owners investment. I will definitely be writing corporate because this experience is completely opposite of the experiences I had at the Torrance location in California which were always great.",

It's the most inconsistent place I've ever order from. While I was nursing my daughter who had a dairy allergy and I expressed to them please no dairy on my food. What do I get?Cheese all over it. This occurred more then once. The fact that they didn't take the allergy seriously was shocking. Again I do really like the food but it's frustrating you aren't getting what you ordered. I pay for chips and guacamole. I don't receive chips or guacamole. I order 4 chicken tacos, 4 fish tacos... Bout 2 chicken tacos have \"spicey\" (spelled incorrectly, besides the point, lol) and 3 fish tacos have \"spicey\" written on them. So we have to open all them up and separate them all ourselves. I'm missing sauce on tacos that I requested fish tacos original. My orders are never hard I promise. There is seriously more situations to count. I know having my husband open up all the orders while in the restaurant would help a ton but let's be honest that's a pain and shouldn't be needed. Plus he usually never knows what I order, lol. If limes and pick come w fish tacos... Can I please get that next time?! Not just sometimes. I love that it's close just wish they could get my simple orders correct and keep consistency w the food. :-(",

I ordered chicken tortilla soup and my fiance ordered the pork carnitas burrito. The burrito came out so fast it seemed like a frozen microwave burrito and my pathetic excuse for chicken tortilla soup was hot and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. My soup had cabbage, carrots, whole bay leaves, one piece of chicken and some tortilla strips thrown on top. Worst chicken tortilla soup I've ever had and what a let down. No black beans, corn, avocado, cilantro OR cheese ??? I don't know if we'll ever go back but hopefully they're popular fish tacos taste delicious because our menu items were terrible. The kitchen should serve quality food at all hours and just because I come at night shouldn't mean I should expect poor quality, especially in this city.",
