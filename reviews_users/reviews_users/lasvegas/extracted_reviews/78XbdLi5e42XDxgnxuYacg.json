    "text": "It was NYE when I went, and most other resto's were closed. I had some high hopes due to all the rave reviews. Even the dude working next door told me this place had legit sushi.   Hmmmmm, me thinks otherwise. The waitress told me that the Gentlemen's Club roll was popular, so I got that. The rice was sticky in an unpleasant way, as though there had been too much water used to create the molds. I didn't like the flavor in particular.   Sushi nachos- with spicy crab. That was actually good. I'd order this again.   Wontons- they're cream cheese. Was decent, but it almost tasted as though they had bought frozen ones and stuck them in the oven to heat it up.   My friend had pork katsu which was breaded terribly.   Perhaps the teppan, or other items are better. I was a bit disappointed, granted, it was a very busy night. The coolest part is that the sushi chefs were both Japanese. Those are hard to come by lately. I watched them make the nigiri sushi and they were cutting the fish into extremely thin pieces. :(  I'm glad I didn't order them, since I woulda felt jipped at that point.  I'm giving some stars on here since the wait staff was amazing. Food, not so much.",

    "text": "Outstanding teppan meal and and service.  5 of us went for dinner this evening in the teppanyaki room.  We started with a sashimi assortment, edamame, cucumber salad, kani nachos, and tuna carpaccio.  All were fresh and excellent.  The hibachi meals were large, including soup, salad, rice/noodles and an assortment of veggies.  We went with a couple of versions of the Hibachi Combo which included filet mignon, scallops, shrimp and one of us had salmon.  My only negative comment is that the meat/fish were just a little bland, but acceptable. The servers were prompt and efficient, with plates removed and glasses kept filled.  Overall: one of the better hibachi places in Vegas, and it won't \"Benihana\" your wallet.",

It's real sushi which I really wanted to eat all the time in USA!! Chef Kiyo who is Japanese and he always understand what we want to eat. We are always order \"Omakase of Kiyo\". After we met Kiyo, we don't need to go back to Japan to eat real sushi:)  The sushi which Kiyo makes is perfect. Hardness and balance of rice are splendid! We are always looking forward to what comes out next;) Thank you Kiyo-San!!",

We didn't know the restaurant was known for this - -  we ordered garlic edamame, three roll combo and watched our friends eat an amazing dinner, Waaaaaaaaaaa. Master Chef comes out and entertains you while he's chopping, flipping, firing, juggling and slapping the food around.  It was VERY entertaining and the food looked delicious.  It made our rolls look very boring.  Ha! The servers were great. Oh! And if you check in you can get a free hot sake (whoo hoo! ) its a small bottle - - about the size of the soy sauce bottle so have your friends check in and you all can each have your own starter drink :)",

Eddy is still a great cook but it's just not worth going back . I called one day and was only asking if they had any openings . I knew it was a holiday so it wasn't a huge deal if they were full . Mr. RUDE manager man felt the need to tell me ..  it's a very busy day . You shouldn't expect a reservation . Umm , I didn't ! I called to inquire .  I told him we loved Oh Jah and frequented their restaurant at least once a week . I was just checking to see if it was possible to get 2 people in just like the old manager did .  Was told .. you aren't the only one who spends money in this restaurant ?!?  I told him I understand that but never in my life have I been spoken to in that manner .  I would suggest a different location ! This one has gone so far down hill! I don't see it returning to a great place while it's being managed by a Very rude guy .  Our last visit .. at the end when they flip the shrimp into the customers mouth to catch it .. my youngest wanted to try . I understand it wasn't intentional BUT my son was hit in his eye by the shrimp and it stuck there . Accidents happen but not even an apology . Within 2 days we realized my sons eye was closing and was super puffy . Took him to the ER and was told it was from the shrimp  because it was flung in his eye quickly and was hot . Idk but this has been a small nightmare and the restaurant doesn't  see anything wrong with what happened :/ .. ER co pay was $200 and medication co pay was $40 . That was a pricey dinner .",

The rice was a little wet but every ingredient was fresh.   My mom got the hibachi with scallop.. Scallops are HUGE. They were fresh just a little salty. It was her birthday and the chef made sure to give her special treatment the whole time. Pretty cool.   Dad got the hibachi with shrimp.. It's really good as well   Both parents enjoyed their food thoroughly. The shrimp were huge and plump!   I got the OHJAH combination with the hibachi entree and three choices. The steak, scallop, and shrimp. The steak was amazing. Chef asked how I wanted it cooked I asked for extremely rare and that is what he gave me. The scallops and shrimp were again really good. I should have gotten the salmon as I'm not even that big a fan of scallops but delicious nonetheless.  Refills were plenty and the only thing I didn't like was they didn't ask if we wanted dessert just dropped off the check. But staff was still nice.   FAR away from strip which is where we were coming from but worth it to not eat the overpriced mediocre food.   $102 before tip for 3 people for soda, beer, hand roll, unagi sushi, dragon roll, and the three hibachis.. At Benihana that would've been well over $150!",

They have a sushi bar, dining room, and a section with hibachi tables.  They offer a nice menu that's consists of Japanese dishes, sushi, and Hibachi style cooking. I sat at one of the Hibachi tables. It was the usual show put on like every other Hibachi place, but as always it was funny and entertaining.  The filet tasted just fine and it was cooked just they way I requested.  The sushi rolls were also very good.  As far as the appetizer menu goes, I would definitely recommend the Japanese spring roll and the super white tuna appetizer with jalapenos.  I noticed other items on the menu I would like to order such as; all of the udon dishes and the Sukiyaki for sure. I think I will be heading back there soon. Stop in and give it a go!!",

Our six year old had a ball. He couldn't stop laughing at the chef and the chef was laughing at his comments about the experience. The chef had a doll filled with water that peed out water on to the flames. He then turned the doll onto the kids like a squirt gun and started firing at them. My oldest son was Laughing Out Loud so hard that he made the chef more engaged with them. I wish I caught his name, but I'm terrible with names. I would recommend this chef to any others visiting there because he made the experience so much better for the kids. I left an over 20% tip because I'm sure my family will remember this for awhile! Well worth it. Food was great! My wife and I got the Hibachi Combo to chose three. I got Filet mignon, shrimp, and teriyaki chicken. I think my wife got shrimp, calamari, and NY steak. Of course I couldn't finish it all, but we got a box and a great lunch for tomorrow. If Ohjah reviews comments, we were the party of four for Jeff at 8 pm on 5/13. If you know the chef that served us, please pass on my comments! Loved it! The host and servers were great too. I recommend to anyone.",

Good portion of it as well. There's also a sushi bar and televisions for sports games. It was just not very stroller friendly. We had to park our stroller in the corner instead of next to our table and put the car seat on the chair. A warning to the mommies and daddies, don't put your valuables in your strollers just in case. Also, you can get a free small sake when you check in on Yelp.

We had a great time and will definitely be back for more. Oh, and they had a promo for September- free hot/cold house sake, non-stop! We couldn't believe it. Love this location!",

All the hibachi chefs are talented, entertaining and funny in their own ways. The food is very reasonably priced for hibachi and you definitely will get your money's worth between the soup/salad/veggies/fried rice/entree(s). The waitresses make sure your water cups are full and check-in frequently. There has always been someone to kindly greet us at the door and say thank you as you walk out - I really appreciate that extra attention they make sure to pay their customers. The staff/management does a great job in making sure they earn your (repeat) business. And just an FYI if you have shy dinner guests, the chefs always do the \"shrimp toss\" at the end of the meal, but you can always decline it - which means more shrimp for everyone else!",

While we were eating the manager was like watching us eating like we were going to skip out on the check. I know I'm Spanish but the manager don't have to be like a guard dog. My wife asked the hibachi chef if she can some more sauce for her steak and he just said no and tell us to ask our waitress. I know the waitress and waiter makes tips for living but they are server not servant. After all that me and my family won't ever comes back here. I hope they change the way they work and I hope they change the manager there too.",

I loved that we really didn't have to wait around. I had the filet, scallops, and shrimp. Husband had chicken and scallops. We both loved everything, the scallops were very fresh and large. We also ordered a tiger roll, mehh I think I need to try another roll before I make my mind up on the sushi. The show was the best that I have seen, the chef was very interactive. For everything it was $70 not including tax, prices were good. We defiantly will be back.",

Sometimes it works out & you make new friends and other times you'd like to stick a pen in your eyeball :)  The experience is a show & dinner and for the most part the guys have great personalities and always make you smile with silly onion volcanoes and heart fried rice photo ops. The food is great. I really enjoy the salad & onion soup and we typically order the filet, chicken and I'll get salmon or shrimp every now & then. The chicken dries out the quickest so eat that the fastest and order your meat medium rare because it stays juicy that way. They give you plenty of delicious dipping sauces and ask for some teriyaki sauce for your rice. I like things sweet...  Check-in with yelp & get a free sake! This is a really nice touch and sometimes it's needed with all the birthday singing & screaming kids :)   It's loud, funny, warm from the fires and all this food fills you up! It's a great group spot or bring your family or friends for celebrations.",

Stick to the chicken , salmon , calamari & fried rice in my opinion. I do very much recommend this place if you are craving habachi...",

I'm not sure if it was because it was just a typical busy night or because it was Presidents' Day, but no one had stopped by our table for about 30 min and we had to go and grab someone in order to ask for our check. We were helped by a man named Min, he's the reason we decided to give this place another chance. He not only took extra care of us until we were about to leave but he also brought out two desserts! Min stuck a candle in the tempura ice cream and sung me happy birthday. He went above and beyond to make sure we left happy. The food was delicious and so was the green tea cheesecake and tempura ice cream!!! I can't wait to come back.",

I had the shrimp, my friends had the steak and chicken.  We were all extremely happy.  the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because we all agreed there was something really weird and bad about the fried rice.  So I would recommend getting the noodles or white rice instead.  Overall it was great and its nice that they have sushi as well.",

We originally had planned to visit the Blue Diamond location after I was pleasantly surprised by their great Yelp ratings, but found ourselves near the Flamingo location which had identical ratings.   We entered and were both pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the restaurant. They immediately asked if we wanted a regular table or hibachi table. Being that neither of us was super hungry, we opted to sit at a regular table. We decided we'd take the suggestion of many Yelpers and order one of the dinner specials. We decided on one right in the middle in price range, and boy were we delighted! It came with two special rolls of our choice, some sashimi and nigiri. It came quite quickly and was perfect size for our appetite for that moment.   We hope to return soon to try the hibachi tables! Hopefully this time, my phone will have enough battery life to take a good picture of my food this time! :)",

Aside from the sashimi, our meal didn't taste very good, maybe we didn't order well. The miso tasted like it was made from a packet, the salad dressing changed since my last visit and was not good...like watered down ranch or something.  More disappointing were our entrees the spicy beef was actually very bland and the sauce looked straight from a bottle, like something you expect from a take-out only Chinese Restaurant.   I got Tom yum soup, which I am pretty sure was made a paste it tasted too concentrated and not fresh.    So why three stars instead of two? I think their sushi/sashimi is above par, especially for the price.  If I come back I am just sticking to sashimi.",

Mainly there's one large difference: the quality of fish and the portions of the rolls are fantastic at both places, however, Ohjah has a few pricing specials that are even a greater value than all-you-can-eat. There is the blue diamond platter that has four pieces of sashimi, two special roles of your choice, and five pieces of nigiri. The boat platter and bonsai platter are also tremendous values. I chose the bonsai which is 2 special rolls of my choice plus ten pieces of nigiri. My date and I would normally go out for all-you-can-eat-sushi, and we would spend at least 60 bucks after tax. But here, we spent under 60 while getting better quality sushi with better & bigger portion size and couldn't even eat it all!  All-you-can-eat joints have lesser quality fish and smaller rolls. The sushi chefs at Ohjah were super friendly too. They both chatted us up all night. Can't wait to return!",

The choose 3 meat option offered so much protein at a reasonable price (we got steak, shrimp, and scallops) that  my husband ordered this and I stuck with the basic veggie option. There was no  additional fee to split a plate, which I always enjoy. When the chef realized we were splitting, he cooked the steak to each of our preference, which I find a high class customer service move.   The tempura is perfectly cooked, light and flakey. The veggies are fresh and crispy, which leads me to believe they receive fresh produce daily. The sushi is well prepared, but like a few other yelpers mentioned, a little on the small side, which is fine for an appetizer. I would have been bummed if I ordered that as an entree.   The service was spectacular. No dirty dishes sat for more than 30 seconds. I enjoy restaurants were the staff works as a team rather than saying, \"I'll get your server,\" and this is definitely the culture at Ohjah.   If you live in the area, you've probably received their flyers in the mail for free sake bombs or appetizers, which help you really enjoy a 3 course meal for under $50.",

The server didn't come around to refill drinks either. I understand trying to get everyone's attention to order in a big party can be a hassle, but still provide great service. You never know who will tip big based on service and drinks being refilled",

I was very impressed with the friendly service and the willingness to accommodate (they made a deep fried California roll on request and answered all our questions.)  I especially like that they let you pick your combinations so you aren't stuck with something you don't like just to get the steak or lobster.  You pay a basic 8.95 for salad, soup and the table seat and then you choose your entrees ala carte ranging from 4.95 for chicken to 12.95 for lobster.  (prices may vary).  They also have a kids menu with large portions.    The show is the same you get at any hibachi place with our excellent chef making a rice heart, an egg roll, an onion train, fireworks and volcano.  I was impressed that the chef gave us all a shrimp toss and all but one of us who tried, caught it. (My daughter was too shy to try).  The quality was good and the chef cooked the steak perfectly. We opted for the fried noodles instead of the rice and they were excellent.  The rice looked good too.  Even the ginger dressed salad and the onion soup were very good.  The sushi roll was a little on the skimpy side but tasted very good.  The pricing was right, for two entrees, two drinks, the sushi, we spent less than 45.00.  We will be back!",

Ohjah made my day. I found it via YELP so its only fair that I spread the love.   Boyfriend and I went in the evening maybe around 9pm, there were only 2 full tables seated in the front and a handful of people at the bar, not sure about people in the back. This normally makes me nervous but I was confident in the food after reading reviews. I ordered one of their sashimi dishes and a variety of sushi and the Lychee Sake - everything was delicious and it was one of those times I wish I had starved myself during the day so I could have tried more! My boyfriend tried a few different rolls and an octopus dish (he said it was a little chewy) and he loved the raw tuna tacos!!   All around great price, great quality and we will definitely be back!",

Everything kind of had the same taste from grilling it. Portions were very big and the fried rice was excellent. A bit over priced for quality but fun evening.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night with family to try out their Hibachi cooking since it's near by.  I've been to other near by Japanese Hibachi style restaurants, but I have to say that Ohjah kicked some butt and is at the top of my list.  The salad dressing was delicious and the entire meal was yummy.  I especially enjoyed the Udon noodles and the fresh vegetables.  I was not a huge fan of their onion soup; it was a bit salty and the breaded onion pieces inside looked like it came from a can of crispy onions.  All and all the service was great and the chef preparing our meal was hilarious and very entertaining.  It is a good size restaurant with a private room for dining.  The decor is nice and it has a great vibe.  I hope this plays sticks around because I will definitely be back to try their sushi bar and other menu items.",

I ordered chicken and shrimp and fried rice, and everything was doused with soy sauce and salt, probably because there was no flavor on anything else. We mentioned it was my friend's birthday but apparently they don't do anything special for birthdays. I originally wasn't going to write a review on this restaurant until the young (maybe mid 20's) hibachi chef tried to throw shrimp in my mouth at the end of our meal. He missed, and said \"it's because your big nose got in the way!\" and laughed. Mind you, I hadn't said a word to him prior to this other than \"please\" or \"thank you\" so his rudeness was unwarranted. I'm sorry, but if you're hoping for a good tip or repeat business, don't be rude to your guests. Also, this place needs to find a storage space or something other than stacking their extra boxes of wine and plates and stuff everywhereeeee. It's an eye sore, distracting for guests and looks unprofessional.",

Although I've never been a huge sake fan, I was curious.  It was decent.  We did have to remind the waitress that we order this, as she forgot.  We weren't extremely hungry so we shared two combinations.  We were able to choose 3 main items for each combo (filet mignon, chicken, shrimp). We chose 4 filet mignon and 2 chicken.  We also got noodles, fried rice, and veggies.  As you may know, here they cook in front of you.  Our cook was awesome!! Super personable and funny.  They not only cook in front of you but also put on a show.  They throw ingredients in the air, juggle them, make music with them, etc.  We asked our cook to make our filet the way he likes it.  I don't remember exactly what he did but I remember he cooked it with a bit of apple sauce.  It came out to a medium-ish temp and it was absolutely delicious!!  Everything came out perfect.  He even divided everything for the four of us.  At the end, our cook cut up a piece of shrimp and told us we would be catching it with our mouths.  Lol such a fun experience!   For dessert I had strawberry mochi which was delicious as always.  My brother ordered the tempura ice cream, which I didn't care for.  Usually I like this dessert but the batter was very soft.  We threw our cook a $10 tip.. Not sure if they get tipped out.  I hope they do, as honestly they do more work than the waitress.  Loved this place and can't wait to return :)",

She ordered this huge boat of sushi and sashimi that was soooo good! The sashimi (ahi, hamachi, salmon) was superb! It tasted SO fresh, and the sashimi felt like silk on your tongue! She also ordered a side of other types of sushi that tasted good too! But the ONE thing besides the boat of amazing sushi & sashimi that stood out strong in my memory was the green tea tempura ice cream! Omg!! One bite and I had a complete mouthgasm! It's superrrrr good compared to other places I've tried tempura ice cream! The vanilla tempura ice cream is good too, but the green tea stood out a lot more to me. It is soooo worth it!  Bottom line: I would recommend eating here. & I will definitely be back to eat here again!",

Our chef came to the table and put on a great show while he cooked, he was very friendly and entertaining, he even interacted with the customers at the table, which was fun.

We have tried nearly all the Japanese restaurants in south Summerlin, and while they're all pretty good, Ohjah stands out above the rest.  The dining area is very moody and mature, and even when full, it's easy to speak at the table. The wait-staff are very knowleged in the menu and can quickly recommend choice selections. Not to mention they are all very friendly.  The hibachi is the real show here. Every presentation we've had has been on par or better in terms of performance, and the flavor exceeds that of much pricier venues.  The chefs themselves are inviting and easy to talk to as well.  mentioning pricing, it's very reasonable and cheaper than its competitors in the region. Between me and the Mrs. we spend generally $15-20 less here ordering the same amount elsewhere. Can't beat that.  If you are on the west side of town and are looking for a great experience, look no further than Ohjah.",

It wasn't overly salty like other misos I've had (especially towards the bottom). The salad was pretty good as well, but nothing to write home about. The tempura was on par with some of the best tempura I've ever had.   Sushi dinner (2 rolls) Las Vegas Roll: spicy tuna, cream cheese, spicy mayo, eel sauce. One of the best fried rolls I've ever had. It was really, really good.  Show Me the Love: spicy yellowtail, tuna, salmon, screaming O sauce (similar to spicy mayo). We fought over who got the last piece of this roll, on my birthday. That was how amazing it was.   Fatty Tuna: I didn't try any, but it looked and I was told it tasted, good.  Blue Fin Tuna: Again, I didn't get to try any, it didn't look like anything special, and was told it was unlikely that it was actually Blue Fin. :(  They brought me out a tempura banana dessert for my birthday. It was really sweet on the part of our server, and put a damper on us getting dessert somewhere else afterwards, but I was okay with that. :P  $60 for the amount of food we got was awesome. That's about how much we normally spend on all you can eat, and we got just as full but the rolls were better (although we probably won't put the AYCE place out of our list of go-tos).",

Of course Ohjah is a Hibachi Grill and the food is similar to Benni's but, I think Ohjah has them beat in some areas:  1. Ohjah's sald dressing is to die for! They even package a tub for me without an extra change. Benni's is delicious (ginger-like) but Ohjah's is divine. 2. Psh! The pricing is better. On the strip there is Benihana and I am told that they charge DOUBLE their original pricing. YES, I KNOW IT'S VEGAS but damn! 3. The sushi selection is varied at Ohjah and I feel in love with their Kamikaze roll.  Overall I recommend it to my friends shit, even a stranger that tell me they are heading to Vegas. I do mostly fine dining OFF OF THE STRIP . I also have a liquor store gem (Next door to OHJAH) hint, hint.",

The sushi rice itself should've been great tasting by flavor and texture.  However, the rice was over mixed with the vinegar and it was packed too tight where it lost the \"fluff\" it should have.  The worse part was giving me the ends of the tomago (egg roll). The ends should NEVER be served especially when the intention was for sashimi or sushi.  I do not know if they were either thinking it was a waste but just from that, the presentation was already a lost before tasting.  Service:  The staff was nice and the cook for the hibachi was entertaining except there was a moment of turn off  when he asked where I was from and NY was apparently not an acceptable answer because I'm Asian.",

Not that we haven't been to a Hibachi restaurant before but we really just love everything about the place.   The cocktails were pretty good. The servers were pretty fast and attentive. Our cook was funny.He pretty much told us his whole entire life while he was flipping them shrimps for my friend rice. LOL  The food were a little on the expensive side. But honestly we didnt mind because it was just a pleasant experience.  Why 4 stars? The food was a little greasy on salty. Easy on both oil and salt please. :)",

    "text": "My in-laws love coming here because it's nearby, rarely crowded & has good food!   We came in half an hour after the opening time and were seated quickly. I would suggest if you have kids to sit in the little wooden booths because there's a little more privacy & you won't get \"why would you bring children to a restaurant\" stares, LOL!  Here's the breakdown: Shrimp Tempura x2 - Always good. Can't go wrong with it. (5/5)  Veggie Tempura x2 - Also delicious, my favorites are the onion & broccoli. There's also big pieces of winter squash where I would normally see sweet potato, so that's different! But my husband loves it, so that's a brownie point. (5/5)  Beef Udon Soup - My FIL enjoyed it, as well as my daughter. They udon noodles were nice and plump. FIL mentioned there was a LOT of cabbage & the broth didn't have its usually flavor. (4/5)  ** Note: All dinner plates come with soup, salad, & choice of white/brown rice. **  Dinner Side Soup - Wasn't really a fan? I'm more used to a flavorful miso soup on the side. This was just a simple broth. And it wasn't touched most of dinnertime. (2/5)  Dinner Side Sald - I could honestly just eat this by itself. I love the dressing! And it's a light accompaniment to the main courses we were having.  Beef Short Rib - Came on a hot, sizzling plate. Good meat-fat ratio, and it's a BIG portion. The marinade is just enough to taste, but not too much that your hands are dripping with sauce. (5/5)  Salmon Teriyaki - Perfect for the simple, healthy eater. A good serving of grilled salmon with a side of teriyaki sauce. Salmon was lightly seasoned, which isn't a problem since the teriyaki sauce packs a lot of flavor. I also liked how they put the sauce on the side instead of coating the fish. If you're a fancy eater, it might not be your favorite. (5/5)  NY Steak - Similar to the salmon, but with steak. A lot of meat for your money! (5/5)  Service was prompt, and our server was really sweet. The food came out hot & delicious, with a reasonable wait time. Definitely recommend for something classy without paying a ridiculous price.",

They have a full bar, but its also a great place to bring the kids.  Prices are pretty reasonable as well.  If your looking for dinner and a show, I'd definitely check this place out.

The filet tasted seared too long, had a burnt flavor although it was tender, and the sauce did not have enough flavor at all. The scallops were good, but a little over-cooked and chewy. Again, the sauce for the scallops was not flavorful. I took out the chicken for my daughter at home, and it was tough, and she thought the sauce was \"weird,\" and I agree. The fried rice had the oddest flavor, almost too fishy, but my son did like it. The best thing we ordered was the shrimp tempura and the noodles that came with our dinners. For the price, we would not return just for the shrimp, nor would we recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I once gave this place 5 stars, but have changed my mind the more I've eaten here. They overcharge. I ordered Tuna Tartar, which comes with 4 bite-sized pieces of toast. I wanted 6 extra bite-sized toast pieces because the 4 it comes with are too few in proportion to the amount of actual Tuna Tatar you get. So the manager charges me $1 for each extra bite-sized piece of toast - that's $6 for what is the equivalent of about 1 1/2 regular-sized pieces of toast. Forget it. I'll just make toast at home.   Another thing is, there are too many sushi rolls served with cream cheese here. It makes me suspicious enough to think that they're using cream cheese as a filler to replace more expensive, seafood ingredients. Maybe I'm one of a minority, but I dislike having cream cheese in any of my sushi rolls - it just doesn't go with the taste of seafood and rice. I thought sushi was priced high so I could taste mostly seafood, not a lot of cream cheese. But ask them to cook a roll without the cream cheese that originally comes with it, and do they decrease the price even a little bit? Of course not. I only gave this place 3 stars because the quality of the food is still good - but that credit goes to the chefs, not to the manager.  P.S., I dare you to ask for an extra cup of tea and not fall over at what they charge you just for that. For that amount, you should be able to keep the cup.",

    "text": "Ordered $120 food to go last week including a few appetizers, special rolls combo, and an Ohjah boat.  Everything tasted very good, server was friendly and helpful, but the rolls were the tiniest I have ever seen in my life! On an average the diameter of each rolls was no bigger than 1.25\", and that was including the fish, garnish or batter on top. The nigiri was like fun size snickers (without the wrap), and sashimi was skinny as well. To me their \"Sushi Dinner Special\" was nothing special when you compare the price and the size because the sushi rolls only worth 1/2 the regular menu price.",

Sushi was good, not excellent, but considering the reasonable price I give it an extra star. The interior decor is much more attractive than the odd tinted windows visible from the exterior. I would recommend this restaurant for a date. Don't forget to checkin on Yelp for free saki!!!",

Perfect amount of garlic and heat. A couple of us had the fried noodles and a couple had the fried rice... Both were delicious...I just prefer fried rice myself and I thought there's was very tasty... And it was a big serving. I enjoyed the NY steak and calamari.... The calamari was Spectacular!!! It was better than the shrimp and scallops. Better texture and flavor. And I'm not a huge calamari fan... But this was THAT good! Meaty and succulent. Steak was prepared perfectly. Veggies were also quite tasty.... Steamed with a light fry.... Not soggy at all. Our chef was fun and entertaining...while being professional and efficient.  Overall... I totally will come back!!  Highly recommend making a reservation.  The hibachi table sits 8.  Tip: if you are an LVAC member...you get 10% discount. :)",

Also as yummy as the food is it gave everyone in my party of 6 food poisoning. Perhaps it was just an off night for them or maybe a dirty towel.

    "text": "I love that the new Ohjah location is so much closer to me! I can easily stop in after work because it's literally on my way home. I stopped by a couple times already. I used any old excuse to stop in like \"It's Monday\", \"I don't want to eat Super Bowl food for dinner\", \"I had a hard day and I deserve it!\". Let's go through my exciting food choices...shall we?   I tried their Japanese Spring Roll ($6.95). It is mainly some greens with fake crab mixed with the spicy mayo, avocado wrapped in a roll. It's a little salty for me so lately I've been asking them not to put the sauce on the bottom of the rolls . I'd rather have it on the side. I still love this appetizer and it's a bit addicting for me.   The Crunch roll ($6.95) is yummy! I like some crunch to my sushi sometimes. I like the sauce they sprinkle it with because the roll has that sweet and salty taste. The shrimp tails on the edges of the rolls are little tricky for me to maneuver around but practice makes perfect!   The Chicken Kat's plate ($11.95) was pretty big because I'm used to being served just one piece of chicken but this came with two! I had to take the other one home. It's a nice meal that will fill you up!   I wanted to try other appetizers besides the spring rolls so I tried their Kani Nachos  ($3.75). It a big fried won ton with crab meat , avocado and some sort of oil on top of it. I didn't care too much for the oil. It was tricky to eat so I did miss having the spring rolls.   I had the Pink Lady ($10.95) which is sushi wrapped in pink rice paper. This is my favorite one I have tried so far. It's not because it's pink but I like the mix of flavors in it . I think this one also has cream cheese . I love rolls with light cream cheese!  The Calamari ($7.25) here melts in your mouth! It's not rubbery or has a fishy smell like some places I 've been to lately. They give you generous meaty pieces . I think you get a lot for your money on this dish. I could barely finish the last one. This would be my number one appetizer and the spring rolls would come in  a close second.  The last roll I had was wrapped in avocado . I think it was the Shogun roll ($9.95). This would be tied with the Pink Lady because I liked them so much! It's hard for me to choose.   We also came here for Hibachi which is always excellent! They have a meal where you can choose three meats for around $39.95. I chose the scallops, shrimp and fillet Mignon. It was entertaining and delicious!    The service here is top notch! The handful of times I've been here they have always given me the best customer service by checking on me and making sure my drink is always full. It was an overall awesome eating experience for me!",

The managers are to be commended for how flawless and friendly the service is. I started to break out my phone to give this place five stars just from our service before we ate.   But then... the food!  One of the best sushi rolls I've ever had is their French Kiss, followed by their Sex On The Beach.   The filet minion and the shrimp are amazing on the grill, and everything was cooked to perfection.   The chef lit our food on fire like it was a work of performance art. He mentioned he had nearly 15 years of doing this, and it showed.   Next time we're in Vegas we are 100% coming back here.",

Please @ me if you can find a better hibachi joint in Vegas - I don't think you will.",

We got a table and made our selections, a couple roles of sushi, and couple of entrees.  The service was fast and attentive, coming by often to check on us.  Making small talk.  Our bill came and the prices are consistent with what we expected.  When we got up to leave, the friendly little manager just ignored us as we walked by, I was disappointed and thought he must of overlooked us, but as we went through the door, he did look up at us, so I guess we didn't spend enough to warrant a handshake.   The food was good enough on it's own to make a return visit worth it, perhaps with family coming in, we can make it.",

    "text": "I have a theory about the high marks on this place, versus my very fair rating of \"2\" stars:  1. The person has never had any other Japanese food, and so does not know better;  2. People are drinking a lot of sake and so the taste of the food really does not matter;  3. These awesome reviews are a bit old;  4. or, the place just had a bad night the night I went.  The reason for 2 stars:  1. The food was really, really overcooked. Everything was overcooked. \"Cook it 'till it's dead!\" must be their mantra. Steak, overcooked. Vegetables, overcooked. Rice, overcooked. Chicken, overcooked. Fish, overcooked. Shrimp, overcooked. Tempura, overcooked. (And greasy! The oil needs to be changed...or just made hotter. Tempura, though fried, is not supposed to taste greasy.)  Tea, overcooked! Shoot, even the salad was overcooked...okay, just kidding about that. But really, everything was super overcooked. It's like, are they fighting against amoeba dysentery, or something? What IS it???  2. The place needs a little renovating. It's a fun atmosphere, especially the hibachi area, but everything feels like it's about 5-10 years due for a renovation. (It might not even be that old, but it feels like that!) There were some areas where cleanliness, or rather, repairs, were needed, that were obvious. You know what they are, Ohjah!  3. The service was really uneven. Not enough attention at the table (water and tea glasses were not filled within a reasonable time).  And rather than sincerely asking how everything was, the tone of question was, \"You like everything, RIGHT?!!\" NOT EXACTLY CONDUCIVE TO HONEST FEEDBACK...like, \"Dude, you killed my steak so dead, it would not have a chance at the afterlife, even in India!\"  On the plus side (why it is not 1-star), it is a fun, rollicking and convenient  place to dine. If you came just for drinks, you would have a terrific time.  So, maybe it's just an off-night. But don't take your most important client there, or your best sweetie, without checking it out first.",

First off the sushi is delicious it's our favorite in town so far very fresh, delicious with a good variety. The dinner portions are also generally sized and decently priced. I ordered the Japanese shrimp noodles last time and was really good. Also the Hibachi is great and has great flavor and the prices are very good. If you sit at a table the service is also great, friendly and attentive. A woman named Jing was serving us and she was super sweet and very helpful with the menu and our options. It will take another Japanese restaurant to be outstanding for us to want to go anywhere else until then we will only come here and suggest it to others as well.",

Not too salty and the flavor was great for the rice, meat, sauces and vegetables. 2) The guy doing the hibachi was great. Super funny and interactive, I enjoyed him very much. 3) Nice atmosphere overall, place was fun, lighting and music were on-point. Good Hibachi is always a good time.  Cons:  1) Saki arrived room temp - not desirable 2) \"Fresh\" oysters arrived to the table on a bed of lettuce (not ice) and were a bit warmer than room temp. I was quite disappointed 3) Portions. This was the biggest disappointment for me. I know, when it comes to hibachi, the entire table's food is cooked at once and portioned out onto everyone's plates. However, the first 3 people kept getting the best portions and then the rest of us got scraps (literally). It was like he ran out of each item by the time he got to my plate. I was so frustrated that I actually counted my vegetables (6 pieces). Only 5 pieces of shrimp, and only 6 little pieces of steak (and I mean small). I really wish I had taken a picture because my plate was quite sad and disappointing. What's even more frustrating is the 1st girl who had a heaping pile of veggies had scooped them on to her BF's plate because she didn't \"want\" any and here I am with 6. For the price of $35/person I felt like I got more like $9 dollars worth of food and a ton of rice.",

My wife is dangerously allergic to avocado.  We ordered a roll without avo, but it was accidentally made with it.  They pulled the avo off and served it to my wife.  Luckily, I saw the green residue on the rice.  Upon closer inspection,  there were more chunks of poisonous avo waiting to take my love away from me...and send her to the hospital.    Also, the rice with nigiri is shaped wrong, which tells you the sushi chefs are less skilled than previously.   When we first sat down our plates had hair on them; yuck!   Servers are still very nice, but not very attentive to check in often.  You only see them when an order is being dropped off.  We had to flag our server time every time we needed something like tea or water refill, plate, chopstick, adding orders.  Also, the ventilation need an upgrade. No matter where you sit in the restaurant, and it's a big space, you end up smelling like cooking oil and smoke.  The fish is still fresh and the prices are still very fair.",

My dad wanted to go to a hibachi place, and rather than paying a $800 check for the four of us at one of the Vegas hotels, I decided to find someplace local.  This place is amazing! While we did have to wait twenty minutes past our reservation because the party that was seated for the previous hibachi did not want to leave, the rest of the experience was perfect. The food was delicious, our hibachi chef was funny and skilled, the roll I had was tasty, and the service was great. It was to the point that my dad is already planning on coming back here for our next Vegas trip. The best thing about this place is that they still care about the quality of their food, rather than the bigger chains like Benihana and Shogun, which have gone down a lot in quality. Their filet, shrimp, scallop, calamari (We had a lot of food :P) were all excellent. We will definitely be back! The best part was, after the four courses, the roll, and the drinks, the bill wasn't some obscene amount. I highly recommend!",

Im not sure if they have the white sauce that I am so use to getting at other Japanese Steakhouses, but I did receive a red and drown dipping sauce. The sauces weren't bad but they weren't as good as the delicious white sauce.

You can use it or save it; it's nice to have that option.    Menu: Huge! (I checked it out before coming here- on this site (4.5 stars), and on their website), a nice variety including regular dinners, Thai curry, sushi rolls, Hibachi dinners (all of them are base plus the entree, separate pricing), as well as the Children's Menu (under 12). Portions are large. I didn't know what I wanted to order, but then again, that's a good problem to have!   Ambiance: Very nice, elegant, dimly lit, and clean. Tables seem more private because of the logo glass partitians. We were seated in the regular dining room section. The sushi chefs were in front of us in the same room (along the wall; all of them were asian). The other side was the Hibachi side (the smells were wafting down to our side; it also seemed to be the more popular room).   Customer base: Families (with children) and seniors  Service: Excellent service from our server, Hong (Darren), who was very nice, and when we sent the curry back (it was too hot for my hubby at #2), he wanted to make sure that the second time, it was just right. We could hear the manager speaking to him, explaining, except he almost sounded irritated that we sent it back. He was in the bar area, which was just across from our table, a few feet. I appreciated that Hong remained polite and checked in with us several times and refilled hubby's water (without my hubby asking).    We got the regular edamame appetizer, $3.50, the chicken egg rolls appetizer, free (used the coupon), the california roll, $4.95, seafood thai curry, $14.50, combination yakisoba, $12.95, and the kids teriyaki dinner, $11.95 (came with soup, salad, side, and stir-fried vegetables). Total cost of our dinner was $51.80, not including tip. The receipt shows suggestions for 18% (automatic for parties of 6 or more), 20%, and 30%. We even had leftovers!   I really liked the taste of the food, the curry was delicious (with added chili pepper sauce- I like medium spicy, in general), the yakisoba (the veggies had a nice crunch, not soggy or overdone) my soup (mmm) and salad (that dressing!), and the side of fried rice (our son didn't want it, but he really enjoyed the soup and the teriyaki chicken) were the standouts for me. It was also surprisingly generous portions. My hubby liked it more the following day, said the taste was even better the second time around. The quality of the ingredients was also something I noticed.    I also like the large menu, there is something for everyone (assuming one likes asian food, that is). All around, this restaurant is pretty impressive. And, we would come back here again, maybe even try the Hibachi next time.",

Jimmy our chef was amazing and enjoyed every minute. He has a great positive attitude and is very entertaining . Jimmy did some cool tricks while preparing the food and cooking it right in front of you on an awesome frying type skillet table. You get rice or noodles, mixed veggies,  soup, and a salad for a set amount to start and then you pick what kind of meat/seafood you want for an additional price. Looking at about $20 per plate for the basic chicken or steak. Kobe and lobster selection was a bit pricey. After all cooked up and served you were given two type of sauces to dip your meat/seafood in. To be honest quality of meat was great but not so much flavor to it unless you drenched it in the sauce. You can also get sushi as well. I got two rolls and was very tasty. For about 6 of us bill came out to be about $155, keeping in mind most of us only had water or icetea, 2 rolls, and bill was with gratuity included since we were a party of 6. We enjoyed ourselves very much! Ask for Jimmy and don't forget to tip your chef when he's done with the show! :)",

The soup and salad that came with the meal was ok but the dressing was very watery! The chef was friendly and stated that he was new so I assume that's why my experience differs from others. The shrimp and steak had zero flavor.. He only added a tiny bit of garlic to the shrimp along with a ton of salt and the steak had only salt and pepper on it with no other seasoning. The noodles ended up having the best flavor so I'm happy that I paid the up charge and added them on. The only reason I'm giving this place a 2 was the amazing sushi role we started with... Needless to say I won't be back again which is a bummer since it's right around the corner from my home.",

The food cooked on the grill was mostly done well. my sushi roll was good too.   The Bad. Got a flat soda. The salad had french dressing on it, instead of a miso carrot dressing. The dipping sauces for the hibachi grilled foods wasn't to my liking. They really like to cook a lot of the hibachi items with teriyaki sauce. It really was too sweet and killed all the benefits of cooking on a hibachi.   The teriyaki pushed it over the edge for me. I could forgive their other condiment choices, but the sickly sweet sauce was too much. At least give an option not to use the teriyaki sauce.",

The food was nothing special either, not enough seasonings/flavor. It wasn't horrible but there are better hibachi places in town that I'd rather go to. Chef put on an okay show, he was pleasant. Restaurant was clean. But i doubt I'll be returning.",

I love fried rice cooked on the habachi table and this was the worst ever..... the rice was not cooked well... it was hard and crunchy, and had no flavor at all! My husband ordered the Kobe steak adding on the live shrimp......and he was very upset. We have had Kobe steak at several restaurants and this was again the worst ever!!! IF it was Kobe it must have been in their freezer for several years and they defrosted it in the microwave. There is no other explanation for a Kobe steak to taste that bad. I had the filet mignon.... it was good. The live shrimp were good also, but you get one shrimp when you add it on to your dinner, yes ONE... so that was really the only edible part of my husbands meal.... ONE shrimp. If you go...... DO NOT order the Kobe steak and DO NOT get the fried rice.  I really recommend going somewhere else for habachi!",

Only gripe I have is that there were some insulting comments from the chef towards the woman I brought to dinner about here being with me.  I'm white and she is asian.  Don't know if maybe he just didn't like that.  Anyway the food and service has always been great.   Maybe I am out of line but it wasn't appreciated seeing I picked this place for our first date and she was the one that said it was insulting.  Love the food love the atmosphere would've been a lifetime customer but after that I will not be returning.",

Ali is our little one's favorite chef, he was great with kids unlike some chef's who forget they are cooking for an audience. We tried some different rolls, enjoyed the onion soup and of course loved the fried rice.  The chicken, filet and shrimp are succulent. The only thing to avoid hibachi style is the calamari steaks-ick and bland!  Another positive is that the wine/drink menu has an remarkable price point. My favorite glass of Sauvignon Blanc goes for double  the price at other joints.  Finally, the owners/managers want your business. They do what it takes to make the customers happy;a rare find these days.  Keep doing what you are doing, OHJAH!",

Ask for more garlic or butter or whatever you want, even to avoid items.  Chefs Eddie and Charlie are our favorites - but we have never had a bad chef.

Never washed his hands either. And it wasn't just one cough, it went on. He would turn his back to cough but cough all over the food in the back. Total turn off. It's not the first time that same chef grossed us out. He really makes me question what he does when nobody is looking. Sorry Ohjah it's time for him to go.

I can't stray away from this dish, all time favorite :)   My son really likes it here, fancy taste for a 6 year old. He orders the shrimp udon tempura. He likes it with extra shrimp tempura, tentsuyu and of course with a side of edamame. He loves it and can eat halfway through the bowl.   Service here is very good, they really tend to the tables.

I love the filet and scallops and I know my husband loves the lobster tail and my daughter often gets a combo with chicken and shrimp and filet. The rice and vegetables are always great and the chefs always make for a fun evening. Last night it was just my husband and I and we weren't super hungry so we didn't do the tapas room. My husband had sushi, and said it was fresh and filling. I had the onion soup,a salad, the spicy garlic edamame and the Japanese Lasanga roll which is my favorite. The service was fantastic and the food delicious",

We placed an order to go a few weeks ago before New Years so it wasn't a inconvenience. When we placed our order we never received some of our items along with their house salad, rice, and soup. I'm not big on complaining, but when you pay close to 70 and I always spend that amount or more from the last several times being here.  I tried calling several times and then finally when I called for a 5th time I explained to the girl on the phone what happened and she said we will take care if you next time. Then hung up lol, ok you never received my name or number, didn't even bother looking our order up after explaining we were missing some items and only said that and hung up.  I admit they have excellent choices on their menu and I still think this small issue could be remedied, but I just found it kind of funny that after coming here over 8 times this is the first time I saw poor service by far.  But I still admit this place beats going anywhere else! I still love this restaurant more than any other one I've been to!",

I got the king salmon which consists of spicy salmon inside and salmon on top with a lemon slice. Soooo yummy! Then I got a cowboy roll!!! Oh my goodness it has torched steak on top and raw tuna and cooked shrimp inside. Like how can you even get better than that? Well it comes with this balsamic garlic ponzu tasting sauce! Amazinggg!!! And then for my third roll I got a Grand Canyon which is baked avocado and crab with salmon on top and smothered in eel and yum yum mayo sauce! They give an abundance of wasabi and ginger and you can ask for more with no problem. I got a side of seaweed salad and my total came out to $32. My new go to take out sushi roll place! The guy who took my order over the phone as super nice. They also have hibachi grills if you dive in. It looked super nice inside! I will go back and dine in for sure! Try this place and try the rolls I mentioned! It's so worth it!",

Absolutely no taste whatsoever. Actually it tasted like warm water. We always were served the Miso soup but not this time. The Tempura dinner was so greasy and not even hot. The dipping sauce was so watered down that we asked for a different sauce. We ended up taking the outside off of the tempura and eating the shrimp and vegetables plain. I gave 2 stars only for our waitress and the salad.",

So, when my husband asked me to find a good place to go for a night out together, I couldn't help be come back to Ohjah multiple times.   We have never been to Ohjah, nor did we know what to expect. So when they offered to sit us at the hibachi grill we were like \"sure, try something new.\" I'm so glad we did. Our chef was super entertaining, which could no have been easy considering the 7 others that sat near us were not engaged, did not smile or have a good time even though he fought for laughter. He even cut up a shrimp and threw it in the air for my husband to catch in his mouth. Very fun! Not only that, the food was incredible. We got the crunch roll to start and did the 3 meat entree combo with calamari, shrimp and filet. It was so yummy we cannot wait to go enjoy again and this time maybe take our kids to share in the fun. MAYBE!",

I had to repeat the order of all the nigiris again (!!!) and assured him that we can eat everything (lol). I haven't even received the food yet but it wont make up for the bad service we've had already. I live close by and could've made this place a regular spot but prrrrrrrrr sorry guys. Actually the food just got here as I was typing this, and it IS pretty good. But still two stars.

The chef made fun performance for the kids. Beside those usual techniques, we saw some new staff, like pupping heart shape from fried rice, smoking mountain from onion, Micky mouse from eggs and even animal balloons.  He made all the kids laughing and smiling. The steak and scallops were perfect cooked and the fried rice was moist.  Overall , we all enjoyed the delicious hibachi with endless laughter and clapping hands. For whoever wants to host a party, you should differently think about book the Ohjah party room!!!!",

I can't believe I've been trying places all over the valley and the strip, while this was so close to Summerlin.   We started with the Fuji Apple and Lychee Sake, which were both fantastic. We also tried the calamari, which was a terrific choice. We did the dinner special, which was a great price for three rolls. The Golden Gate, Pink Lady, and Show Me the Love were really some of the best rolls I've had in Vegas.   Our total bill was $63, which included 3 rolls, an appetizer and 3 drinks. Not bad at all for the quality here. I will definitely be returning.",

My husband even said that the red (fatty?) tuna was the best he ever had as well.  It has been a few months since that night but I have been thinking about that food since then.

Eddy was our chef, he is engaging and extremely entertaining. The wait staff is usually very attentive and your drink rarely goes empty.  We recently visited that \"other place\" and in comparison Ohjah is much better in value and most importantly the food was better. Ohjah still has a family restaurant feel and appeal whereas the larger establishment has gotten very commercial in my opinion.  Going back? Absolutely!",

The chefs keep you entertained with their cutting skills, juggling eggs, cooking your entrees in front of you.. My kids love the part when they toss shrimp into your mouth!  Their sushi is excellent too. Service is very efficient.  We tried tempura ice cream, was huge enough for 4 of us to share and delicious!",

So all that was open was this place, and how could we just drive on by?   Inside it smelled delicious, like sizzling steak and broth, and it was subdued but welcoming.

First off, the ambience is very romantic. This is a great place to come for a date night. The food was amazing! Though I did not do the hibachi, I tried the mixed drinks and the regular menu. I got the chicken yakisoba and it was delicious! I asked for it extra spicy, and they came through on that! I also tried the peach martini which was awesome. I definitely recommend this drink. I tried the calamari tempura. This was tender and tasty. Though I would say, having the thicker portion of calamari is not my favorite. I will definitely return here to try their hibachi, though the yakisoba was so tasty it would be hard to pass up!",

I have been going to Ohjah here and there for a while now, and I would say it is average. The service is not the best, last time I was there the food came out at all different times so while everyone was eating I was waiting which is not the best scenario.  I would say Ohjah is a safe call when it comes to sushi. I would not consider it high end, but it is good for the money and you get what you pay for.   I will say they do have a very good hibachi so there is something for everyone there.",

Food was cooked almost to order. Steak was a little over done and rice was partially cooked (Not the cooks fault but of the kids who sat with me at the table and decided to change their mind last minute). Wait staff was very friendly and polite. Prices wasn't too bad either. Chef was your typical hibachi chef with all the same American jokes so not a lot of originality there. I would go there again but wouldn't seek it out.",

The place is really nice and clean, and I really like the details they put into for the design.  Our waitress was really nice and friendly. She explained things to us about the menu items, which was very helpful. Also, she gave us suggestions on what to eat, which is pretty helpful for us first-timers here. She was very patient bcs we did take quite awhile to choose what to eat.   Finally settled and ordered and our food got to our table pretty quickly ! The pre-meal started with soup and a salad. & the salad was super yummy !!!! I really enjoyed it. It was light and the sauce was the best part. The soup was very simple, which was nice. We tried the onion soup bcs it was something new & different from the usual miso soup.   We also got the fresh half shell oysters ($5.95 for 3) and it was yummy ! I love oysters. Though if you're an oyster fanatic, there are better places out there than this. But I guess it satisfied my small craving.   When we got our food, we were so surprised as to how big the plate and portions were. It really fills you up ! The food was super yummy and looked amazing !!!! Like it so pretty. & on a side note, I was half way done with my meal, and I noticed something a little off, so I mentioned it to our waitress. She was really nice and sincere about the whole thing and brought her manager over to take care of us. He apologized and quickly got myself a brand new meal replacement. It was really nice of them and they weren't butt faces about it (unlike some restaurants).  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience ! Definitely will be back bcs the people there are so lively and friendly. They really do care about the customer and go beyond expectations. As for the food, yummy and fills you up ! Next time, we'll be back to try the sushi and the hibachi grill ! So until next time (:",

I recommend the Ninja for those parents with kids trying to eat well on a budget. It is a good portion but you can only order the Ninja dining in.  It is fine because the ambience of the restaurant is very open and comfortable. So we didn't mind that at all. A must go!  I give this place 5 happy stars!:)",

We had 4 kids and he didn't do any tricks.  We had to ask for a couple to be done because the kids love them.  Also multiple food items were wrong.  Food was missing and was not as good.  Just not good service at all.  Waitress was nice and trying hard to make up for the mistakes.  Still a really bad experience.",

We started off with California roll which was tasty and gyoza which was equally good.  3 of us order the salmon teriyaki dinner, fish was tender and most and good sized portions.  My friends especially liked the fried carrot which was tasty.  Another person ordered the steak teriyaki and the meat was plentiful and tasty.  We also ordered the scallop teriyaki and that was equally delicious.  I ordered the unagi donburi and they also gave us free sake.  All in all the service was attentive and food was tasty.  Cons was that I had to wait a bit for my donburi and after dinner two of us were thirsty.  So I'm not sure if it was the weather or the food had msg.",

Beautiful decor and felt somewhat absorbed in the Japanese culture with the Japanese music playing- very romantic even though I was alone in the middle of the afternoon. The big screens put me off a bit but not too much since they were silent...thank you.  Checked in on Yelp and got a small hot sake...yeah! I bookmarked and will certainly return soon.",

Our server was very friendly and offered excellent service. I opted for the spicy chicken dinner which came with miso soup and salad, nice. The salad was fresh and crisp but was overly drenched in the house dressing and was more like soup at the bottom. The miso was your traditional miso and nothing special. The main course of spicy chicken was perfectly seasoned and proper heat but again had way to much sauce at the bottom of the dish. The chicken was tender and veggies still crisp despite having a robust amount of sauce. Overall it was a decent meal with good service but nothing to knock your sox off.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on Monday around 9pm. It was very quiet, but that just meant a private table for us! I was surprised by the quality of the meat. Normally the meat is good, but not great at places like this. This place was great. The filet melted in my mouth like butter. The New York strip was cooked perfectly, and the seafood (shrimp and lobster tail) tasted extremely fresh. Friendly staff was a plus as well. This is my favorite hibachi place in Vegas now and I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "A nice cozy Japanese hibachi restaurant.  My bf and I were excited to try their hibachi since the last experience we had (not going to mention the other hibachi restaurant) was not very good and memorable.  So, we ordered the New York steak and Shrimp hibachi with a couple of rolls. Let's start with the rolls - they were basically the highlight of our dinner. We tried the White Tiger and the Captain's rolls which were both surprisingly delicious. A must try! So after that we thought it will be better since the rolls were so good. Then the weird onion soup came. It had deep fried onions and crispy noodles in a clear broth. It would've been better if there were no crispy noodles. It just tasted funky. The salad that came with the hibachi set wasn't bad. So the hibachi chef started his show and cooked our food. My bf was getting nervous already when he saw how the chef cooked it. He didn't season the steak and shrimp. Put a little salt, soy sauce and pepper in the fried rice and veggies. So when we tasted our food, unsurprisingly it was very bland. I had to shower the whole plate with salt. Our hibachi experience was once again a disappointing one. We were not even given a sauce to dip our shrimp and New York steak. We saw on the other table, the chef gave them automatically the sauce. Plus the chef from the other table seasoned the shrimp and steak well by putting a little lemon and butter. Probably we were just unlucky getting that chef.  The service was not bad. The servers were attentive that's why I am giving 3 stars - one for each roll and service.   Oh one more thing, I think their hibachi is pretty pricey. So the basic hibachi with veggies is $8.95 and if I want extra shrimp, it's extra $7.95 for probably 6 pieces of small shrimp.   Maybe we will back for the rolls but for sure not for the hibachi unless we can be guaranteed that it will not be the same chef again.",

We used to order from there regularly, a few times a week, due to other options opening in the area we branched out, only to return this evening for a very poor meal. First off my husbands favorite dish, filet fried rice, is apparently no longer offered and has been replaced by sub-par beef, which was a struggle to get down. The hamachi is not as good as it used to be, I used to order like 4 at a time!  The tomago was inedible and the chop sticks left splinters throughout the food. For rice we will stick to Jumping Rice & Rolls from now on and for sushi, the search continues. Sad.",

    "text": "Came here for the company Christmas party weeks ago and we all had a really good time! This was my first time at a hibachi restaurant, so I wasn't sure what to expect... One thing I did know ahead of time is that it's pretty pricey, so I'd only come here for special occasions, but the quality of the food & the overall experience makes it worth it.  We reserved one of the bigger private rooms, which had two hibachi grills & cook stations surrounded by countered seating. I'd say there was enough room for a party of 20 or so. Eddie, the chef assigned to my side of the room, was super friendly and the little show he put on while preparing our food was hilarious!  Their menu is pretty big, although I'd recommend sticking with the hibachi route. There's several meats to choose from, including a few different seafood options. I ended up getting filet mignon and a sushi roll - which was MORE than enough - but if you've got a real hunger and are eying more than one thing on the hibachi menu, I'd try the Pick Three option. For about $30, you can choose any 3 meats (excluding lobster, Kobe beef, etc.) If you order any hibachi item, you also get onion soup & a simple salad as appetizers, along with your choice of fried rice or noodles.  All in all, I'm glad we came to Ohjah! The one complaint I do have is that there was a scheduling conflict with our reservation. We were scheduled for 8:00, but once we arrived, there was a still an earlier party having dinner in our private room. Eventually, they wrapped up and it all smoothed out, but it was a little disappointing regardless. I'm gonna have to knock off one star for that... OTHERWISE, Ohjah was great. I'll be back!",

    "text": "Came to this location, with some family, to celebrate my uncle's birthday. This was one of the places i had selected for my uncle to pick, that was out of the usual places, and his son most likely not having experienced it.   I have been to another location (blue diamond and decatur) before, mid last year, for a friend's birthday. So liked to try a different location and compare experiences.   We arrived, a little before 7pm, on a tuesday evening. Seated immediately upon arrival, next to a group of 3, in the back, where their Hibachi (also known as teppanyaki) tables are at.   NOTE: HOT TEA IS $2.25 (not sure if its per person or 1 time group charge.... but they gave a cast iron tea kettle)  Since we were a party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child), most of us had opt'ed for their Hibachi combination. $28.95 including their Hibachi Basic Entree ($8.95) + 3 items of your choice (excluding kobe beef, halibut, lobster tail, and live seafood). Their items range from $6 - $9, so essentially, saving on 1 entree. The only person who didn't get the combination was my mom. She got the basic entree + lobster tail ($16.95)  Basic entrees include a soup, salad, vegetable (variety of veggies cooked in front of you), and choice of rice (white, brown, fried rice, or fried noodles).   Not going to list what EACH of us got, but in combination, we had ordered the New York Steak (5 oz - $7.25), Filet Mignon (5 oz - $8.55), Shrimp Teppanyaki (3 oz - $6.75), Scallop Teriyaki (5 oz - $8.55), Calamari (7 oz - $6.95), and the above mentioned lobster tail teriyaki (6 oz - $16.95)   The chef did his little performance with the fire and \"volcano\" act with the onions. First thing he cooked was the veggies, fried rice, and fried noodles.   Veggies were cooked well and seasoned nicely.  Fried rice had a nice \"bite\" to it and was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Fried noodles, a bit towards the salty side. Too much sauce used.   Afterward, the seafood, and the chicken (not ours, but was part of order for the group of 3 next to us) was cooked.   Calamari was SUPRISINGLY thick (1-2cm) and was cut into cubes. Cooked perfectly and was super tender. Not chewy AT ALL !   Scallops were HUGE fresh scallops that were cooked perfectly as well. Super tender, seasoned perfectly !  Lobster, though on the small side, was cooked ok. May be a little overcooked for my own preference, but seasoned nicely. Not sure when he removed the shell either.   After all the seafood was cooked, the new york steaks, and the filet mignon's were cooked. (yes chicken was still being cooked, slowly on the side).   To my surprise, the chef may have cooked the new york steak better than the filet mignon. Everyone in my party, ordered medium rare, whereas the other party, had medium. To be honest, i think all our pieces were medium to medium well. Though i had said the chef may have cooked the NY steak better, but doesn't mean it was well cooked. Both cuts of beef were overcooked to what we had ordered causing it to be a little chewy and dry, especially the filet mignon, being a lean cut of meat, but supposed to be tender due to the nature of it being a tenderloin.   OH ! With EACH phones check-in to yelp, you get a FREE small bottle of hot sake. We had gotten two bottles from using my check in and my mom's. Their sake was light. Fairly smooth to drink.   Overall experience was not bad. Performance ive seen better. Cook on various things, was good and bad, depending on the item. I think i'd prefer the blue diamond location more, experience wise, even though this one is much closer.",

I took advantage of the free sake with check in which doesn't give you the option of the flavored sakes but did let you choose between plain hot or cold. I also ordered a different speciality drink and it was good. They aren't a bar so I didn't expect too much in that arena, so I was impartial to it.   I'm definitely going back!",

It was a nice try but I don't think I'm ever coming back. The price was reasonable but I rather pay a little more and enjoy my food. Couldn't really eat any of the food, we ended up packing everything to go but tossed it in the trash bc it was just way to salty. Went here for Mother's Day dinner and good thing we made reservations be the place was packed. Give it a try u might have a better chef",

Our first experience was so good we have gone back multiple times, their service and food is always consistently great. They offer great deals for checking in with them on Yelp, just a helpful tip if you plan on dining there. The sushi is so fresh and so clean, the service is quick and professional. Just beware that the location on Lake Sahara is Hibachi only, so if your in the mood for their sushi avoid that location. I've never had their Hibachi but their sushi is one of the best I've tried here in Vegas for a great price. Try them out and leave a review!!!",

The waitress tended mostly to the group we shared a table with--they were drinking bottles of wine. The chef went through the motions but was quite boring and not a very good chef either. I ordered scallops. They were the first thing he put on the hibachi and the last thing he SCRAPED off the grill--over 20 minutes they sat on a scalding hot grill. They were so over cooked they bounced!  (Someone needs to tell him the scallops should have been cooked last with the shrimp) The chef clanged the salt shaker with a fork so loudly  my ears were ringing. Then he did it again with the pepper!  This was his only \"show\" besides making fire at the start and tossing some shrimp at people at the end.",

I get double rice instead of veggies, shrimp or chicken(i got both tonight) and Charlie knows I still like the veggies so he gives me some at the end.

Fried rice, hardly any egg and garlic. I just don't understand why they would skimp on the flavor and food considering we're a big party and we always love to dine out on so many occasions.

    "text": "What a fun place to go with a large group!  22 of us came in and had a blast!  The hibachi was good...what you would expect from comparable hibachi places with a few nice nuances, but it was the quality of the sushi that really surprised me. My love and I decided to share some nigiri and a hibachi combination...little did we know that someone in our group ordered two Ohjah Boats consisting of 3 Special Rolls, chef's choice of 12 pieces of Sashimi,10 pieces of Nigiri, and seaweed salad. As fortune would have it, several individuals were not fans of sushi, leaving a few of us with the task of finishing this \"appetizer\" before the hibachi cooking began. The nigiri and sashimi caught my eye and my taste buds immediately, and I knew this would be a pleasant experience!  The Hibachi Chefs are really hit or miss. Our group was in a large private area with two hibachi tables, requiring two hibachi chefs. One of them was outstanding, entertaining, and immensely fun...the other?...well he did a fine job of cooking. I recommend going to hibachi in a large group. In most places, the tables seat eight or ten people, and I prefer filling the table as much as possible. Be sure to hone your food-in-mouth catching skills before you go to any hibachi spot since it is mandatory world hibachi law for the chefs to toss pieces of shrimp into any willing patrons gaping mouth...and while you could pass on this experience it is incredibly bad karma and the shrimp gods will also take note and punish you at a later date for your unwillingness to participate. Hey, you're the one who decided to go to a hibachi establishment in the first place, so know the rules and get over it!...but I digress.    Our nigiri arrived before the hibachi was finished cooking, and it was consistently good as indicated from the Ohjah Boat samplings. Ohjah's Hibachi Basic Entree must be ordered by every member of your party, except for children ordering from the kids menu. The Basic Entree is $8.95 and includes Zucchini, Mushroom, and Onion Teppanyaki, a House Salad, Onion Soup, and your choice of Fried Rice, Fried Noodle, Steamed Rice or Brown Rice. We decided to add the Ohjah Hibachi Combination for $30.95, allowing you to choose 3 items (excluding Kobe Beef, Halibut, Lobster Tail and Live Seafood), electing to go with Salmon, Scallop, and Sole Fish. The scallops and sole fish were wonderfully cooked, while the salmon was a little over cooked...but by this point we had our fill and were now pawning portions of our hibachi off on our friends. Hibachi is not a meal I want to have often, but I'd certainly come back to Ohjah the next time hibachi is in order.",

    "text": "Very happy with my experience here. Went to try their sushi, ended up ordering the yakigyu and fried rice for our toddler (he only picks at sushi). Tried the Golden Gate roll, Captain, & Dragon no avocado plus cream cheese. They were all part of the special rolls, which offers 3 special rolls for $23.95.   The Dragon was topped with thinly sliced seared eel, just what I prefer. I've had Dragon rolls with large hunks of eel on top in the past, was not a fan. This one was sweet and creamy (cream cheese) with the tempura crunch.   Next was the Captain- cucumber and spicy with sliced albacore and fried onion topping. Seriously good balance of flavors, fresh fish. Added ginger to spice it up, I love a SPICY tuna, just personal preference. ;)  Last was the Golden Gate which was the perfect ending. Shrimp tempura, Cucumber, crab with variety of fresh fish sliced on top and CRUNCH. this was my fave! Very fresh fish. Next time I'm going for the sashimi, the table next to us had the boat of sashimi, nigiri, & rolls...but I like to dip my toes at sushi places with rolls first, to see how quality their product is before diving into sashimi.  Skip the yakigyu, beef skewers...very dry. Could have shot it at our neighbors sushi boat, for a good battle.   One HUGE surprise was their fantastic fried rice. I never would have ordered something like that there...glad we did. It was clean, fresh, flavorful. I haven't had a good fresh fried rice that's not homemade since I don't know when. They all end up tasting like soy sauce greasy onions. Not this one.  Our server was great. She was friendly and had good timing. She took our drink order ASAP, gave us time to look, checked in, we needed more time, she happily obliged, checked in when we were ready, filled our waters and kept the sake flowing. All with an authentic smile and calmness even when they got busy. Really couldn't ask for more there.  One disclaimer- 3 rolls was more than plenty for 2!",

It's delicious    They are pretty efficient at the Hibachi Table; you can be entertained and enjoy your dinner in about an hour...so it's a good choice if you want dinner before you dash to your reserved seats at The Summerlin 5 Regal theater. I also like that they will do separate checks if you come in with a group...heads up though, if it's six or more people they will add the (divided) tip to each of the separate checks. They don't tell you that little tidbit, so I'm telling you so you don't accidentally overtip.   They have these little rooms with tables that seat about 6 people...so if you want to linger over your meal, that's the perfect seating for a small group. Probably a good idea to request those about a week in advance.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  I had a really good meal at Ohjah.  I went to the teppanyaki section of the restaurant, but they also have regular Japanese dining and a surprisingly extensive menu.  Prices are very fair and we even got free small sakes upon check-in.  Together we ordered the chicken and the shrimp teppanyaki meals with fried rice for one and noodles the other.  Each came with a large serving of rice/noodles, a small salad, a cup of onion soup, lots of vegetables, and 4-5oz of our desired meat.  All of this (for 2) came out to about $35.  The amount of food they provided, with quality at every stage, was actually very surprising.  The noodles and rice were flavored well but not much going on in them.  The shrimp and chicken were great.  And the salad and soup, both unexpected with our order, were a nice opening course.  I really like the speed of teppanyaki restaurants where food is constantly being served upon completion with the chef entertaining as we go.  I usually don't enjoy sitting with other people during my meal, but I guess that's part of the show.  We had a couple of weird eating neighbors so I would recommend coming with a group (6-8) to get a full on better experience.  The servers were great.  The chef was entertaining and did not disappoint in tricks and showmanship.  The portions, quality, and price were all on point.  Give Ohjah a go if you want some good teppanyaki.  And they have a few locations across the city so seek out your closest.  You might want to make a reservation or call ahead though as primetime is sometimes really full for this restaurant's live cooking section.",

So we ordered drinks and sashimi. The fish was very fresh and fell apart in my mouth. I can always tell good yellowtail and this was very fresh.  The hibachi dinner was fun. You may want to look the other way when you see how much butter goes into the meal, but boy is it worth it. Charlie was our chef and was very good at tossing the egg around without breaking it. Someone mentioned the salad dressing, yes, very good. With our hibachi dinner we ordered chicken, filet and calamari, all tender meat.  I can't decide which I liked better, the rice or noodles, so do what we did and order one of each.  All and all an amazing experience and delicious food. Will definitely be back(soon).",

Some do have good happy hour bargains, some have fun bar scenes, but as for really good food, the area hasn't delivered. Our family decided to give this place a shot. And it really worked out well. Food was really, really good. Atmosphere was very nice. Looks like a great place for a date for single people, and also for a family night out. Service was also really good. They definitly have a system in place that all the servers know and execute well. Everyone was in a very good, pleasant mood. Sushi was very fresh. The habachi is very good, very reasonable prices.

However, this is the first Japanese establishment I have walked into, and not been greeted by, or smiled at by the sushi bar, and the staff immediately.   The menu selections offered classic favorites, as well as a variety of specialty rolls that were wonderfully built. However, seeing as they are in Las Vegas, and surrounded by other sushi restaurants, I believe it would behoove them to add an all you can eat future to the menu, because the all a cart prices of some of the rolls are absolutely far too high for the way they are built. My rolls were delicious, but fell apart quite easily in my chopsticks, and the rice crumbled into the soy sauce. Now I am a traditionalist, so I barely do it when I roll into my soy sauce, and my row fell apart, all three of my rolls fell apart. Again, they were delicious!   It should be noted, that the tuna was the freshest I have seen in Las Vegas. It was dark dark pink, almost read. It was truly the chocolate of tuna fish. Bravo.",

We had the steak and scallops--both were cooked to the perfect done-ness. Only the chicken comes with sweet teriyaki sauce. The other meats had a subtle soy sauce-base seasoning. The kids were captivated by the chef's cooking show, which allowed the adults to talk and eat in peace. They do offer appetizers (goyza potstickers, egg rolls) which are an inexpensive option for kids who may not be big eaters. Oh, and we got a free small sale with check in on Yelp--they will bring two cups if you ask. It was just the right amount for two.",

Once we arrived, the hostess immediately seated us at the teppanyaki table and took our drink orders. They were promptly delivered. We then ordered a few appetizers which were also promptly delivered. By this time the chef at the table across from us started his cooking show and my kids cheered up! Shortly after that we placed our order and the show began. We had a great time as did our kids. They all want to go back now. We had a great time and the staff was definitely very attentive just as most of these other reviews claim.",

The drinks were very well priced especially compared to other Japanese restaurants that want to charge $12.00 for a martini. Service staff was friendly, attentive and fast. Manager was all over the place making sure everyone was happy. Teppanyaki chef was a lot of fun! Kids loved him. Nice portion size, very fresh sushi and just a wonderful atmosphere. If you live up in Summerlin you should really try this place out!",

    "text": "Ohjah certainly deserves all 5 stars, from the high quality food and presentation to the outstanding service.  A little background information on why we are giving 5 stars -- Hubby and I lived in West Los Angeles for 11 years, enjoying some great Japanese food.  When we moved to Orange County late 2011, we were highly disappointed by the lack of good or even just decent Japanese food in the area (it quickly became apparent to us that OC Yelpers did not know what we considered good food).  For the past 4-5 years, hubby and I have been really missing Japanese food, but we had given up in OC.  Hubby and I brought our little one to visit the in-laws here in Summerlin for Easter, and we got in yesterday from Cali.  Mother-in-law suggested we go to Ohjah, since they had eaten here about two weeks ago for their first time, and they really enjoyed it.  I had no idea that MIL doesn't even like Japanese food!  (She has had many disappointing experiences in her life.)  I guess Ohjah has converted her.  Husband was skeptical and wasn't ready to try it, until he read Yelp reviews yesterday evening.  We decided to eat dinner here to celebrate Easter, and we were pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything we ordered was.    We got in around 4 PM to avoid the dinner crowd, so we were promptly seated after many customary greetings.  We ordered the following:  Shrimp tempura dinner (included vegetable and seafood tempura, miso soup, and a salad) Miso soup Special Roll Combo -- we chose: Volcano roll (without cream cheese), Philadelphia roll, and Blue Diamond roll California roll Edamame Green tea ice-cream Vegetable fried rice Tempura ice-cream -- with tempura banana*  Comments about the food: 1)  If you are looking to order a few Special Rolls, the Special Roll Combo is really worth it; it is like buying 2 and getting 1 free! Such a great deal and so delicious.  Nice presentation was an added plus.  Everything was so fresh, including the raw fish.  Although the volcano roll was notated as a spicy roll, it wasn't, which I was happy with since I do not typically eat spicy foods. 2) Miso soup: I didn't have any, but my son, who is an extremely picky eater (secondary to his Sensory Processing Disorder) enjoyed it. 3) Shrimp tempura: so delicious that even my extremely picky eating son ate two bites!! 4) Additional tempura included yam, cuttlefish, imitation crab, and onions.  We liked it as it was not too thick with batter, light, and didn't appear too greasy.  Husband said the tempura sauce was not sweet, though. I typically dip my tempura in sauce, but I didn't because it was already really delicious. 5) I was really expecting just one scoop of green tea ice-cream so  I was so giddy when the bowl with 2 scoops and 2 mounds of whipped cream arrived! Before I could pick up a spoon, my little one was about 1/3 way through the first scoop.   6)  Our tempura ice-cream arrived shortly after, and our waiter politely commented that they put on extra tempura banana, which is typically a separate order.  I exclaimed to husband, \"We were just comped tempura bananas?!\"  We were thrilled because they were so good! Even MIL, who was skeptical of tempura desserts, enjoyed them.  We were guessing that maybe they comped us because the waiter had asked if it was our first time, and we had told him it was our first and our in-laws second.  Unfortunately, in-laws, who were so kind to pick up the bill, didn't know that we were comped the tempura banana so they felt embarrassed about not leaving a bigger tip (even though they tipped 20%). 7) The vegetable fried rice had a nice variety of vegetables (i.e., onions, broccoli, green peppers, carrots).  We ordered it for my picky son (who usually eats restaurant fried rice and not when I cook it), but he didn't even eat any because he was so into the Miso Soup.  I was expecting it to be greasy like Chinese restaurants, but it wasn't.  What added to our great dining experience was our very hospitable waiter.  He was attentive and personable, checking on us quite often and making small talk especially about our son, which is always nice since staff from other restaurants can wince when they see toddlers coming to dine.    When we were walking out, the manager or owner asked us how we heard about Ohjah, so we explained what was mentioned previously.  We noted that we will certainly be leaving a positive review on Yelp.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews on the same day unless it is that good (or bad).    In-laws mentioned that it used to be a Denny's that did terrible (couldn't even make decent hash browns), so they were really happy to see that it was replaced with a great restaurant.  They are hoping that people will leave more positive reviews so that this restaurant thrives.  In-laws live less than 5 minutes away, and needless to say, we will be back!  Next time, we are hoping to try the hibachi menu.",

Then we moved on to the hibachi food. We ordered the NY steak and our son got the shrimp. Both were very tasty and the veggies and rice/noodles that came with it were perfectly cooked and oustanding. We have a lot of usuals that we go to but this was a nice change. I might have to add this into our list of usuals. The atmosphere itself was really great, clean & modern restaurant and was dimly lit. I will definitely come back without the kids. (kids hated the steam and fire from the hibachi grill)",

I get sushi takeout from here once every 1-2 weeks, and we occasionally dine in at the hibachi table.  Chefs are always entertaining and excellent at what they do.  Can't beat freshly made fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and filet mignon.  They also have great deals on sushi and sashimi combo platters.  Always a pleasure to stop in!",
