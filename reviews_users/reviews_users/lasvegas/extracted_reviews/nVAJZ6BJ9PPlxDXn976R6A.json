Hardest thing is trying to find a seat. Got the #1 which is the double double meal and got the burger animal style. Animal style adds a special sauce to the burger. The fries are chopped fresh in house, so freshness is guaranteed.",

I went through the dive thru and asked them to bag it up but they still gave it to me as off we were eating in the car. That wasn't bad except for everything after that just made it such a bad experience. The hamburger was bland with lettuce that was wilted and soggy. The tomato slices were end pieces and old like they've been sitting all day. And when I asked for a specific amount of special spreads for my french fries (4) the guy only gave me two.  :-(  Usually I'm not one to complain but I feel like tonight was NOT worth the money I paid. I will not be going back to that in n out again.",

    "text": "Sweet In-N-Out.  Fantastic burgers with fresh toppings.  Mediocre fries.  A mandatory stop with any trip to Las Vegas.  Go for the double double or 3x3 and get the usual toppings but add a whole grilled onion - game-changer.  The ingredients are always fresh and delicious.  The one downside with this location is it's proximity to the Strip.  While this may make it more convenient for you to get here, it also makes it convenient for the masses to converge onto this one location during the lunch hours.  The lines can often wrap into the dining area, and seating is doggone difficult to find (pardon my language).  The service is usually pretty quick with the army of burger flippers, fry guys, and runners that they have, but it can be pretty hectic.  Unfortunately, drive-thru isn't much quicker as the line of cars often wraps around the store.  Still, if you're in Vegas, hit up the best value burger place there is!  Enjoy!",

The staff was kind and my food was somewhat prompt. The facility was disgusting, though. The floors had trash and dirt and black shoe prints all over the store. The drink area was sticky and wet.   On a positive note, I did get to see one of the first UFC female fighters having a burger there after her fight. She was not in good condition, but she seemed happy to be feasting on an In-N-Out burger.",

Pair that with the amazing service and you couldn't be happier. I love how you can trade in your bun and have your cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce.

Possibly, the busiest that I've ever visited.   Expect the usual great tasting food and fantastic customer service. Nothing has changed about those qualities that In-N-Out is known for, but do expect the following:  - There are long lines that can stretch out to the door, but they move fairly quickly.  - Be prepared to wait more than 10 minutes for your food to be ready. This was not due to service, but due to the large volume of orders.  - Limited seating. Actually, there's plenty of seating, but it might be tough finding a spot; bring extra people to seat stalk and reserve spaces.  - Sticky floors and messy tables. Considering how this place receives a lot of traffic, I can imagine that it'd be difficult to keep it spic-and-span. However, the employees do their best to make sure the restaurant is cleanly.   My suggestion would be to visit another In-N-Out location. But if you're dying to have an In-N-Out Burger fix and don't mind the wait, then by all means give this location a go.",

Insert copulatory motion joke here, if you must, but In-N-Out is more than just another euphemism for \"the motion of the ocean.\"  It's the best damn hamburger joint on the West Coast. Period. End of sentence.   The \"double-double animal style\" with extra mayo and fresh cut fries cost under $6 and yet are a better meal in my mind than meals I've had in LV for 20 times the price.   The fries are hot and crisp, but not hard. They are flaky and steamy starchy salty sticks sent from a loving New Testament kind of God.

It's just good.  stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later. *quick shout out to worker Ed for making us laugh with stories about how much Spirit Airlines sucks*  So the food:  I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out.   No matter what time you go, there's always a line but the employees (there's like 40 people back there) are quick and organized.  I really respect that the chain doesn't expand towards the east coast. It gives tourists something to look forward to when they arrive.",

    "text": "Why I love IN-N-OUT:  - Fresh Ingredients - Lightly Toasted Buttered Buns - Creamy Shakes. If you don't mind mixing flavors, try their Neapolitan shake. It's not listed in their store menu b/c its a \"secret.\" - Extremely AFFORDABLE!  - Double-Double Animal Style. You won't see this on the menu board either. This is off their \"Secret Menu.\" - Fast and Friendly Cashiers - Yummy Pink Lemonade  Whats \"OK\" about IN-N-OUT:  - Mediocre Fries. A fellow Yelper, Ben G mentioned \"they get cold very quickly.\" I completely agree. - Thin (but tasty) Meat Patties  I love Shake Shack for many reasons. It is definitely pricier than In-N-Out, but for the quality and deliciousness, its worth it. Eventhough Shake Shack's fries are just OK, I like their fries better than the ones at In-N-Out. The meat patty at Shake Shack is also thicker and juicier.   Question: Would I visit IN-N-OUT or Shake Shack more if they (in my dreams) opened side by side?  Answer: IN-N-OUT. You get the same high quality ingredients (yes, a thinner meat patty), but you don't have to fork out as much cash! I can do without fries.   This was so worth the walk from the strip (which was NOT bad at all).  {Note} It's packed in here, but people eat quite fast. You should be able to find a seat inside soon enough. If you're going in a big group, it may be quicker for you to find seats outside.   {Tip} Their \"Secret Menu\" is really not a secret. Go on their website, click on Menu and you will see a tiny folder labeled \"NOT-SO-SECRET-MENU.\" Now you're in the loop :D",

To go along with that I got fries animal style and a root beer float (yes I'm a fat fat person).  The burger was fantastic, I could have eaten two of them.  The peppers they have in the condiment bar are spicy and a great addition!  I probably wouldn't get animal style fries with this burger again, it was just too heavy.

Came here after a mall and unfortunately after a football game. It was crazy busy so we decided to eat in the car. I ordered the usual #1 double-double with grilled onions and a lemonade. I pretty much inhaled it and didn't speak to anyone for the 5 minutes it took me to eat it. They got our order right even when we had 7 people to order for and some of us ordered it with grilled onions, regular onions, no lettuce, only tomato, yada, yada, yada. Good job! Always a pleasure and always a necessity when visiting.   The great thing about this location is that it is right next to their brand store. My pops bought me an In-N-Out beach towel and my husband picked up a shirt on sale. Hawaii people are major fans so these things are awesome.  In-N-Out is a must and this location is pretty busy but worth the wait.",

Just because it's the thing to do when you make it to the west coast, we once again made our way here. First off, kudos to the staff here - they work their way through the mass orders like it's nothing. Secondly, one super nice employee tipped us on the barely used second set of rest rooms just across the street at their retail store. In-N-Out Burger scores high on my list just for those two points alone.  But on to the food, personally I think their fries are hit or miss. (Please don't hate.) Unfortunately, they lacked crunch this time around and I found myself going through ketchup like there's no tomorrow. The burger was decent; you could tell it was freshly made and had a good amount of veggies on it. Really, you can't go wrong - it may not be the best burger you'll ever have but it always hits the spot.",

My husband and I made a point of checking out I-N-Out on our recent trip to Vegas. We studied what we could find of the secret menu online and knew what we would get. My husband had his heart set on lots of cheese and I was excited to try the Neapolitan shake. So my husband got a 2x4, cheese fries and a drink and I ordered a double with fries and the shake. The total was way less than comparable items would be at McDonalds, by at least $8. Everything was great...greasy, but great! My husband said he was confused and thought he would get 4 slices of cheese total, not on each patty. He ended up not finishing the burger, but only because he couldn't eat any more cheese. We both agreed that we would choose In-N-Out over other fast food restaurants any day if we had one in Colorado. If you live near an In-N-Out I consider you a lucky person.",

I was also upset that I don't use the word \"miffed\" anywhere near as much as it deserves to be used. So imagine my surprise and happiness when I found out that In-N-Out has an outpost in Vegas.  In case you can't imagine it, it was kind of anticlimactic in that I didn't jump around or throw midgets in celebration. I was just really happy while sitting in a moving car.  So, which is better? Subjectively, I would still say Shake Shack. The girl, however, who does not like any hamburger ever created, ate 75% of my Animal Style burger in the time it took me to take a sip of my milkshake (Neopolitan, because you have to order off the menu anytime you're given the opportunity in life). She then spent the rest of the trip, and nearly every day up to the time I'm writing this review, complaining that she hasn't had another one, but what does she know?",

So be prepared to wait in line and wait a bit for your meal.  Sometimes you even have to wait for a seat so you can actually enjoy your cardiac arrest on a platter!  one pattie, fries and a drink is plenty for me...but I know some people go hog wild. If you also get the 'special sauce' on the side and/or just get ketchup/mustard it saves you like 10 grams of fat [all the nutritional info is on their website]  I just wish they served beer.

It's the one closet to the Las Vegas strip.  The animal style is always the way to go. It's a secret menu item that has lost its secret menu luster because it's not a very well kept secret. Everyone gets their burgers and fries animal style now and days. It's not on the actual menu so don't look for it on their official menu board. The animal style sauce is almost like a thousand island remix.   For 8 bucks for a whole meal, you can get cheaper eats than that!   Ask for a free bumper sticker. It's not an obnoxious sticker. It's a small sticker that you can stick on your snowboard or roller blades.",

We ordered 1 grilled cheese, 1 animal style fry, 1 burger with grilled onions, 1 animal style with NO cheese, 1 double double, 1 animal style fry no onions and 1 coke. The guy at the first window repeated the order back wrong as he only took down 1 animal fry and a normal fry. The issue wasn't even that we needed to adjust the order the issue was when it was brought up and we informed him he had it wrong he immediately closed the window when said it was wrong and he didn't allow us to inform him what the right order was. He did this 3 times and legit said \"no I have it right trust me.\" HE DID NOT. Luckily the guy at the next window got the fries right however the burger didn't have grilled onions and we didn't get a drink. Completely disappointed mostly because I've never had an issue before with anyone or had to deal with the bad customer service. I appreciate the effort of the person at the second window but Jonas wasn't the best, it could have been an off night but just not impressed",

I had a regular cheeseburger and my guest had a Double Double. I wish I had gotten a Double Double because I felt like a regular needed more meat! That Double Double was delicious! Idk what they do but it's not like any other burger out there! Yum! Fries are OK.   This location is infested with people, 5 min wait to order, a beehive inside, and everyone is happy chowin down!

In n Out is as consistent as they get. I have never been to a location where the food and service slightly varied. Always hot, fresh, cooked to order burgers and fries. I usually get a single with cheese and spread only.  When hungrier I get the double double.   What you need to know about this location, is that it may be the busiest In n Out there is, and that is saying a lot because they are all busy. Being that this one is very close to the Vegas strip, you can imagine it is busy at all hours. If you want to avoid the rush, you might be able to at 10:30a when they open. That said, the location is run well like all of them, so it is well staffed and they handle the massive volumes just fine. The seating is usually full, but usually by the time your food is ready enough tables will free up that you can grab one, as long as you are paying attention. When I ate here yesterday I ended up joining another couple that was at a table of four. Not an uncommon practice at this location. Parking can also be limited, but usually not a problem. You will see people at this location pull up in Ubers or taxis on their way to or from the airport. People love it so much some can't even wait to get to their hotel before grabbing a burger there. Or they want one last one before flying home. I have done it myself.",

It's also $3.80 at this establishment. Say what?!? At a time when Shake Shake is selling burgers for twice the price, I'm amazed that In&Out is able to keep prices so low. The burger is juicy, delicious, just the right amount of everything put together into one taste explosion in your mouth. And the fries that go along with that? Freshly cut, and extremely tasty. I like throwing a bunch of salt over it but it's good on its own too.  For this particular location, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it wasn't as crowded as I expected. But I guess compared to the one in Barstow, any other location probably looks empty.  If you're in Vegas and want a burger, you can try a bunch of the fancy restaurants out there. But there's one place where you'll always get the best dependable burger on the west coast while also being light on your wallet (so you can spend it on other stuff in Vegas) - that's at In&Out.",

Also the cut of the tomato slice was a decent thickness. I would not waste time writing a review on a fast food chain but this is one of the few places worth my time.

I've been drooling and salivating every, single, time when people describe to me the incredible taste of a Double Double. Being in Florida, I'm sh*t out of luck to have a taste, and I always finding myself ending up at a burger place, wondering how sh*tty the burger is that I'm shoving into my mouth, comparing to what I can get at In-N-Out.  FINALLY! First time to Vegas and this is THE first spot I hit!  The line for the food is literally out the door. I think the entire Las Vegas population is waiting to get a burger at this place. Frustrating? Yes, but I waited in line and let my hunger build, while wondering if I should order 5 or 20 of these legendary Double Doubles.  In the end I chickened out and just got 2 with a side of cheesy fries.  Man o man, the fries SUCKED. They are cold and soggy and everything not nice.   As for the burger, it was pretty good but not great. It's just about as good as a regular cheese burger that you can get at other similar places. (Actually it reminded me a lot of Steak N' Shake's burger)   I was really let down. I was told by many others who swears by In-N-Out that I was cheated at the Las Vegas location, and should give it another try when I'm actually in California.  We'll see....",

Sure, they have thousand island on them, but otherwise they're pretty flavorless. I would rate them near the middle on the chain burger scale. Their fries, on the other hand, are just the worst. They have to be the driest thing I've ever eaten. Even tried them animal style and they somehow got drier. Some people like their fries overcooked, unsalted, and in a state of rigor mortis, but not me. I'll take the greasy, salty, worm-like fries any day. I'm not eating them for my health! But enough rambling from me, my advice is to avoid this location during peak hours. It's the closest one to the strip, and the drive thru is always at least 5 cars deep. Go here for lunch, you better have more than 30 minutes. In conclusion, their shakes are pretty good, and worth returning for. I'll assume that's why they're always packed, just dozens of people getting shakes all day.",

Anyways the first stop after checking into the hotel was to grab some lunch. What better staple food than the good old American Burger, fries, and a fountain soda pop?    In N Out Burger was stacked with people. I bet there were a good 50 people either ordering food or waiting for their order to show up!  My friend turned to me and said this place is a gold mine!  Thanks for the heads up Captain Obvious!  Haha  The food was hot and arrived in a timely manner. It was good wholesome food!  Nothing super duper great but not crappy either. Guess I would categorize a meal here as 'common'. Nothing to write home about but if you're around here you've got to try it out!",

I heard they're opening a location on the Strip which will be very convenient for future travelers.  Service was quick with nice staff. It was definitely busy, but we were luckily able to snag a clean table. Wait time was acceptable.  As for the food itself, I just wasn't impressed. I got the basic combo meal with the hamburger. I'd give the burger a 3/5. The bun was probably the best part, with the patty tasting a bit bland. The fries were a 2/5. They were a bit soggy and plain with no salt (although they do give you a packet to add on which I did).  For what it's worth the food did keep me full for a long time.   I'm glad I went to say that I tried In N Out, but probably wouldn't go back again.",

After two months of hard dieting and working out I needed this indulgence. Nay, I wanted this. I had to have it. The beast within would not be denied.  So easy to get to by cab as it is close to the strip and they are pretty much running back and forth there every few minutes. Quick ride from Bally's and it was easy to grab one back as they are constantly dropping off in the parking lot. Even late at night it was bustling.  Protein style double double, animal style fries, neopolitan shake. Hellz yeah!  I sat down at a table with my feast and engorged my fat ass to my heart's delight! Yes, the guilt and dread after eating this made me hit the gym in the morning to burn off all the fatty calories.   Is it overhyped? Sure is, and it's not as good as many claim. Shake Shack in NYC is a better tasting burger. Still, you go for the freshly made food here and the ability to order off the not so secret menu which is part of the fun novelty of In-N-Out. That, and the diverse crowd that populates this place. The locals, tourists, and wackos alike make for some fun people watching.",

If you are going through the drive-thru always say you are eating in the car even if you aren't because the box they put it in is way stronger than the napkin-esque bag they put burgers in otherwise.",

The floors were messy with trash and no one was walking around to clean things up.  I was with a friend who previously was a manager at In N Out in Arizona and she was critiquing the way things were being ran and mention multiple times how they would fail a QFC (Quality, Friendliness, Cleanliness) check up.  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, it was a Friday night and located right next to the Las Vegas strip.

Loved booth of them, although they are at completely different. My all time favourite has to be the protein style. The only complaint I have is why they are only on the west coast. Why can't we have them all over the USA?? In fact I would love to open it up in the UK!!!!!",

Fortunately I had just leaned out the back window to order two grilled cheese animal-style sandwiches and a large coke from the drive-thru at this burger mecca. The cab driver admitted that no, this was not the first, nor would it be the last, time that he had been hired to drive someone off the strip to score some 10:30am in-n-out. I was confident that this was the right decision.   Twenty minutes later, as I sat across from the check-in counters at McCarran making a mess out of myself with delicious fast-food saucy cheese sandwiches, I thanked myself for making such a glorious call.   In-n-Out truly is special. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. Fast, fresh, delicious, clean, cheap, and damn good.   And this one has a big flashy light-up sign.",

When I jog in my t-shirt, people don't comment on the paradox of running in a fast food t-shirt, but instead, comment on me torturing them with the fact that there are no In-N-Out restaurants on the East Coast.  So what does one do when they wear their threads bare?  Go to the company store.  This place has shwag out the wazoo.  Golf balls, t-shirts, jackets, cups, stickers, magnets, you name it.  You can get most of this online, but if you're in the area and don't feel like paying shipping, this might be worth it.  Unfortunately, this location sucks for two reasons.  First, it is right next to one of the busiest In-N-Out joints I've ever seen.  Second, the store itself is only as large as one shopping aisle at a grocery store and it's packed full of people and crap.  Now that I've done it once, I'll go to the website instead.  But you still have to see it so you know what you're ordering, I guess.",

    "text": "Do In-N-Out shops even need reviews? I think that if you can't appreciate a great burger in America from a self-made family business success story, you should check yourself for communist ties.   This burger chain has been around for decades and I have never been to one that does not have a crowd with lines at the counter and cars backed up at the drive through. Be persistent though and you will be rewarded with a quality, well put together burger that tops just about every other fast food burger chain out there.   This particular store has a separate merchandise shop and it is a fairly large property with more tables inside and out than a typical In-N-Out. There were also more parking spots and on the weekday afternoon I visited, the lines were manageable and my wait time from ordering to stuffing my pie hole was only about 10 minutes.  This location is close to The Strip so I imagine that there are times where the crowds and the wait are going to be terrible but the employees here seemed to be happy to be working and even came around a few times asking if they could get us anything else and clearing away our detritus and debris after the burger mauling that took place at our table. That kind of service I have not seen previously at other In-N-Outs so maybe they are trained to do that to keep people a bit happier while they have to wait. I did observe several locals that were very social with those of us visiting and they were all very proud of this particular location and they were really selling some foreign visitors on the food and the culture. Vegas should sign these people up as marketing ambassadors. I think by the end of the wait, the Japanese tourists patiently trying to hear their order number called were ready to denounce their own citizenship and move here based on the sales job from the local guy in line!   I'm sure the waits can be long here as they are at almost every other In-N-Out I have ever been to but the comforting reward of their burger in my hot little hand is worth it every time.",

    "text": "Sadly, I didn't even get to visit this In-N-Out location because it was so busy the night we were there. It was something my mother wanted to try, and decided that's what we were doing for dinner that night. This was the closest location to where we were.   Unfortunately, the parking lot was completely filled, and the drive-thru was overflowing. So there was almost no chance of parking. My mother has a handicap placard and so we were going to park there. If we didn't, we would have to go find parking somewhere else, like a block or two away and then walk back to the restaurant.   What gives this place one single star is the fact the handicap parking place was filled... by an employee in uniform hanging out with his friends during his break. Obviously the friend couldn't find parking any better than we could, and just took a spot that wasn't meant for him. My brother, who was driving the car said something to the employee, who was very clearly just standing at the vehicle and talking/laughing with his friends. The employee basically said, sorry. Sucks to be you. It left a very bad impression. The employee treated it as if to say, look around. Do you really think you matter? This place is full. Who honestly gives a shit that you aren't going to eat here? That was the attitude this employee had, and it was absolute and complete disrespect. So we left.   Would I return? Absolutely not. I don't need to go somewhere that employees disrespect potential customers, as well as people with disabilities and their need to use a clearly marked handicap parking space to bullshit with their friends on a busy night. There's more than one In-N-Out in Vegas. We went to find another one, and I'm glad we did. They didn't treat it like a frat house either.   Review 122 of 2017.",

They have the happiest, friendliest employees in fast food.  Holy crap! Even Chick-fil-A could take notes from this location of In n Out. After devouring two protein style burgers (go for two burgers instead of a double to maximize the salad), I stopped in next door to pick up some t-shirts for the kids.  They had a great selection, all very reasonably priced for the teenaged crew who love graphic shirts.  I'll be dreaming of my meal here till the next time I'm out West.

The staff was very friendly and helpful on decisions for my co workers who ordered burgers with unnecessary amounts of Patty's. I however opted for the fries. Which were not bad with a dash of salt and a river of ketchup, but I'd imagine a chewing on anything drowned in ketchup cant taste that bad so.. average. The group that I came with said all of their burgers were great... as they were falling asleep  at the table lol The action with the cops, the exploding soda bottle and the now half asleep crew that I'm driving back to work.. I'd like to declare in-n-out the late night battleground of Las Vegas. Quite the experience. Look forward to another late night shift :)  ...Actual Yelp review? Or rant?...  Same same-",

    "text": "Biggest Hype Ever. Think of that movie that everyone told you that would blow your mind and when the credits began rolling at the end you were like, \"That was it?\" In-n-out Burger kind of is like that for me.  Before even entering this place is annoying because you have so many people bothering you for money. It's Vegas, I get it, but isn't fun dealing people essentially waiting for you to get out of your car to ask you for money. Then you go inside and you're in what seems like the longest line ever. Like a Disney(world/land) ride all for the burger and fries. Then if you eat in you've got to figure out where to sit. Good luck because this place is packed with tourist from all across the midwest essentially getting that elusive double-double.  So you order and get that double-double because it has that special sauce of theirs and some fries. I don't do it \"monkey style\" or any other of those weird secret menu things they may or may not have. I just want a burger and fries.  The burger is fine. Typical fast food burger, and I'll say that the meat is better than most, but the fries are the absolute worst. They are not cooked or something, like a soggy potato. Not good, not good at. I can't have a burger without having some fries with it and I can't eat these fries so I can't be a fan of this place.  So many bomb bomb bomb burger places in Las Vegas and I totally get that this is one of those, \"I gotta try at least once\", but I'm okay after that.",

With a limited menu they are fast in getting your order and getting you on your way. I had the double combo.  The burger was awesome but the fries were meh.  Both me and my buddy didn't end up finishing our fries.  Otherwise the burger hit the spot and was a great deal for under $9.",

By the time my order was done they were at handing out order 29. Anyways, the food itself was perfect and the best pre-airplane meal I ever had! It lasted me until I landed and I was still feeling full. For those who don't know what animal fries are, google \"in n out secret menu\" ;) You won't be disappointed. In-N-Out is a must every time I travel to the west coast but you cannot find one on the east coast sadly. Lastly, the prices of the items cannot be beat. Where else are you going to find a burger for ~$2 that ISN'T MCDONALDS? Please open an IN-N-OUT in NYC thank you.",

Potato fries and burgers are both amazing and the self-service pink lemonade is worth a try if you are discovering it.   For the location, being slightly off the strip and given the low price, it does attract quite a lot special characters from the Las Vegas underbelly as well as Uber/Lyft and taxi drivers. Wouldn't be a place I would recommend if you want to keep the impression of Las Vegas glamour and glitz intact, but would definitely be one I would visit if you want to see a bit more of the behind-the-scenes Las Vegas.",

The burger tasted freshly made and the toppings on the animal fries were delicious. The sauce it was topped off with kind of tastes like a different version of the Big Mac sauce. I'm not really a big fan of the fries here though because they're a little soggy. Definitely a cheap meal in a very expensive city is always a plus.",

    "text": "This is pretty much always my first stop after picking up my rental car when in Las Vegas.  This is probably the busiest location in Las Vegas as it's the closest to the airport and The Strip.  They are always busy and there's always a line but they work pretty quickly and efficiently that the wait time isn't too long.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.    The customer service is always pretty good both inside and at the drive-thru.  What I thought was pretty neat was that when you order from the drive-thru, they ask if you'll be eating in your car because they give you paper place mats to put on your lap if you plan to eat in your car.  Pretty nifty In-N-Out!  Their menu is simple yet so satisfying.  They only offer a few types of burgers but they do the job pretty well.  You can also ask for \"animal style\" burgers or fries, it's their own concoction of a sauce-very similar to Thousand Isle dressing.  I've had it but the burgers and fries taste delicious all on their own and you don't really need the dressing.   I love, love, LOVE their french fries because they're freshly cut potatoes.  You can actually see the employees behind the counter using their handy-dandy potato slicer.  This makes that much of a difference because the fries taste so much better if they haven't been frozen.    I think it's awesome that this location draws so many tourists.  Every time I'm here, I feel like I'm at the airport.  One, because it's so busy and two because I always see so many tourists and hear all types of accents.  There have been numerous times where I'll see a couple with like, 4 burgers and 4 orders of fries just trying to get their In-N-Out fix as they don't have one back home.  It's pretty hilarious but totally understandable.    I really wish there was an In-N-Out back home in Hawaii. We desperately need some good quality and low-priced fast food joint like this!",

Personally, I don't find the burgers or fries here as extraordinary or even special; Shake Shack, Fatburger, and a zillion other places in Vegas, deliver a better product.  Everytime I drive by here, and see the parking lot jammed, I find myself at a total loss of understanding, or an appreciation of someone's successful merchandising.

You have to ask for this as it is not listed on the menu - they top your burger and/or fries with chopped onions, special sauce and cheese - and oh man is it amazing! I substituted the drink for a classic vanilla shake to complete the order! It was creamy, smooth and refreshing after a long day of walking around Vegas!  This location had so many employees.

Me, not so much. Both burgers tasted the same and the fries were just okay. I'm not sure what the hype is all about but I won't be back when I'm out west.

Honestly, the burger was average at best. The patty was small and I've had much better fast food burgers from other places (Shake Shack, Five Guys). I'm glad I tried it, but won't go out of my way for it in the future. However, I was told later that I should have gotten the double double, and that would make the burger much better. So maybe one more shot when I'm near an In-N-Out in the future.",

    "text": "I have been misled by these reviews. Just can't believe what reviewers like about this place.  Service was fantastic and they are super clean which isn't the norm for fast food, but:  The shakes were made out of some kind of starchy snotty substance, thick as pudding but not even cold, even reminded me of cold pudding.  Real shakes are made with ice cream and milk.  Burgers were really mealy.  Seemed like they were cooked from frozen patties right to the grill and pink in the middle.  Fries were fresh cut from real potatoes but were cooked in some kind of flavorless oil.  They had no potato flavor.  Coca Cola was great though and lettuce and tomato was welcome to cover up the funky meat I didn't care for.  Lots of people rant and rave about this place and say how you have to try it. A matter of taste I suppose.  If you like McDonalds, you will like it. Try Steak and Shake if you get the chance.",

Noticed that the price have increased by at least 35% on all items so I asked the young man if they got a pay raise..YES he said!  No wonder the prices have jumped so high now.  Ordered my no. 2 and the wife had her no. 1 animal style and I about fell over when the entire bill came close to $12 for both of us.  Never again I told my wife, this is the last time I'm ever gonna eat here or any In-N-Out place again.  I'm not against workers getting raises but to over charge the customers for a product that hasn't changed in years is just plain outrageous.  I hope every body who reads this agrees and stops going to this place to eat.  Better off going to Burger King or McDonalds for their burgers (2-$5.00)",

    "text": "In the last 3+ years, I've taken 3 trips to Cali and/or Vegas.  One thing is for certain, a trip out west is not complete without a visit to In-N-Out Burger.  On my trip earlier this month, I was fortunate to have In-N-Out Burger twice, once in Los Angeles (at a wedding!) and once at this location just off the famed Las Vegas strip.  Going to In-N-Out is always an experience.  The restaurant sign is reminiscent of all the bright neon lights of the strip.  You pull into the parking lot and it's packed with cars, plus at least 5 taxi cabs too.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is a line to take your order, but it moves at a decent pace.  Above the counter is the menu.  It's pretty simple and minimalist.  The hubby and I ordered two Cheeseburgers at $2.45 each and an order of Fresh French Fries at $1.65.  Including tax our order came to $7.08.  Wow!  That's the cheapest, most affordable meal we had in our 4 days in Las Vegas.  My husband called me a cheap date!  But hey, when you have an In-N-Out craving, nothing else will suffice.  There is definitely an interesting crowd inside the restaurant, so we opted to take our food to go and brought it back to our hotel room to have with a bottle of red wine, classy I know.  I really wish In-N-Out Burger would expand to the East Coast, but I'm also pretty sure this will never happen as all of their food is fresh and never frozen, so it cannot travel too far from their processing centers.  I highly recommend stopping here on your next trip to Vegas!",

Like the meat patty, they also have no taste and since they are cheap, are probably loaded with high-fructose corn syrup and other bad additives.  The fries are strange.  You get better fries at McDonalds and Jack in the Box.  I felt a little sick after eating this very bad and very cheap food.  Won't be back.",

It has a simple menu from the early days of hamburger joints ( burgers, fries , n shakes) that hasn't changed through the years.  It works.   Unlike most fast food places, the food here is ALWAYS fresh and made just for you.  I actually dont eat fast food too often anymore but when I do, its here. Yummy burgers, (mine is cheeseburger, no tomatoes, grilled onion, lettuce), fresh crunchy fries, and root beer.  I also make sure I introduce any out of town friends to the wonder of In-n-Out. Always beats their local \"gotta try\"  like white castle  YUCK.   The staff is always friendly and professional, which is great considering how busy they always are.  And just for fun, ask for stickers.  BUT = for this location, be aware it is always crazy busy. Opened few years back, and with the proximity to the Strip, anybody from anywhere who has heard of In-n-Out and makes it to Vegas hits this site.",

The fries were like limp strings of potato with absolutely no crispiness to it. The animal style sauce was - salad dressing? And the strawberry shake was decent, but it would get warm so quickly even in the restaurant that I would have to go through some gross warm shake before I got to the good stuff.

Serving it fresh, made-to-order, and the way you like it is a great reason for their slug-paced movement.    Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.  Get it animal style, their most famous secret menu item, and you'll have pure awesomeness on a bun!

A great meal after you've lost all your money and you need something to pick up your spirits before you make the long plane ride home.  How many times have I done this?  Too many!  During peak times, this has got to be one of the busiest In and Out's around.  It's rare to see it not crazy crowded so seating can be tough.  But if you go at the right time, not the normal lunch and dinner hours, you shouldn't have a problem.  If it's your first time, stop by the store and get a t-shirt for the memories!",

I crave it when I get home to Indiana so much.  There are several In & Outs to choose from around Vegas but the one on Dean Martin is my favorite because its so busy and all the hussle and bussle of the people.

I stopped at this location on a recent drive home from Colorado and was amazed at the massive amount of people inside the restaurant. Now, In N Outs are generally busy at all times of day & night, with at least 5-6 cars or more in the drive-thru at any given moment. But nothing I've ever seen even compares to the sheer number of folks inside this particular In N Out, waiting to get their burger on.   It was a Wednesday, around lunch time, and I got a regular cheeseburger, grilled cheese, fries and soda. The wait to get my food was only about 5-7 minutes which I thought was nothing short of amazing given the mass of humanity surrounding me on all sides at all times. Eating side wasn't an option (even for a party of 2) because there just wasn't any place to sit down, so we ate outside in the shade (in 100+ degree heat, but it's a dry heat!). Good food, good times.",

I've tried it before in San Fran back in 2008, it was good but  did not impress me too much and I was not aware of Animal style.... fail...... so when I was planning a trip to Vegas, I had to make sure to revisit In-N-Out Burger and make sure my double double is animal style. I really enjoy the way the burgers are carefully crafted, every bite has everything i want in it, and it doesnt end up being a big mess that falls apart. From the crisp outer but soft innerds of the bun, freshly cooked patties, fresh veggies, and the flavors of animal style all mixed together to call for a completely enjoyable experience. I could have lived without the animal on the fries, did not enjoy that as much, just a little overboard, i think it was the carmalized onions that didnt mix well on the fries for me. I did observe that they cut the potatoes in the kitchen, not to mention the service is very friendly and efficient.  I walked to In-N-Out Burger from the strip (~15 min walk under a bridge, and sidewalk accross a bridge, and cross at a heavy intersection) but I would def do it again, no brainer.

I always come to this location at least once when im in Vegas, remembering how there was only one location years ago in this city and it was always packed!!(no matter what time of the day you went). Being from SoCal, growing up having In-N-Out frequently, I have to say that In-N-Out has been consistently THAT GOOD throughout the years. One of the Best Hamburger joints out there, if not THE BEST!!",

The burgers are amazing, the fries are incredible, why, we cried, don't we have any of these on the east coast?  Why?",

The best part about it is the special sauce... it somewhat resembles a the big macs special sauce, but BETTER.  The animal fries are fantastically fatalicious, and worth breaking your diet for.  The food is just so simple, and so totally flippin sweet, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  My family may have gotten mad at me for making them wait to eat their food so I could get some good shots, but so be it.",

    "text": "As soon as I booked my trip to LV, the thing I was most excited about was In-n-out burger.  I even rented a car so I could go there whenever I wanted.  The place is totally packed, but they are fast there.  The long line goes by fast and once you order, they cook your food quickly.  Which is key.  Waiting there when you see all the other people eating those amazing burgers while the smell is everywhere is torture.    We each had two cheeseburgers and split fries and a shake. I actually prefer 2 cheeseburgers to a double double.  Thats just me in general.  I don't usually order double cheeseburgers anywhere.  Same with shake shack, I get regular cheeseburgers.   As soon as I took a burger out and bit into it, the rental car expense and the yearning was completely validated.  The bun is great, and the sauce tastes really good.  Ketchup / mayo combination?  Tastes kinda like Big Mac sauce only better.  Technically , I'm not sure how good the actual patty is - it's pretty thin and cooked throughout..but it's fast food and tastes amazing mixed with the cheese, lettuce, tomato, sauce and bun..   The fries are made right there when they put these potatoes through some sort of machine that slices them up, and they are delicious without being too greasy.  It just amazes me that for 2 people to eat this meal, it was like 12 bucks.  It actually depresses me that they don't have this on the east coast and I will have to wait until I go back to vegas or somewhere else out west to experience in n out again.  OMG i can't wait to go back there, its just incredible!!",

I've been an In-N-Out fan for almost 30 years and have yet to find a better burger deal or a better burger from my car.

Growing up in California and going to the original In-N-Out branch- you'd think I would know everything the \"secrets\".   Apparently not as this is my first pepper packet after 17 years.   This place was crazy packed when we went, but I had some friends from Seattle in town that really wanted to have some and this is the closest one to take them. I wish we took them to the Sahara branch because it was a bit of a clusterfuck. I'm sure for first timers though, seeing the famous burger with so many people gathering is a impressive thing. I got one a few blocks from home and had so many of these that the group excitement doesn't hit me.   Major kudos to the crew here as they churn out so many orders that these folks must be always tired after a shift.",

And I am not  a hater.  I enjoy their burgers, in fact I try to stop by whenever I am in an area that has one.    What's sets INO apart is its \"animal style\" aka Thousand Island Sauce.  You get it on your burger, you can get it on your fries.  Whatever.  It \"enhances the taste\" but to me it's all gimmick.  The INO patty is bland with no flavoring (ie ketchup, sauce, etc) it's awfully boring.  The fries are bland as well.    You all probably think I am being unreasonable, but tell me otherwise.  All the people taking about juices from the burger....I feel the patties are too small to begin with you the \"juiciness\" will be limited unless you go double-double or 4x4.  INO is fun, INO is crowded, INO is landmark...but it is also is over-rated.  Good burgers not the best.",

It took me awhile to get my order out and the lady was so nice and didn't rush me at all. The burger was really good...but I have to stay True to my roots and taste buds and say Shake Shack is better (although In-N-Out is cheaper).

BBQ sauce and A1 are usually the only ones I'll use on a burger but most places use nasty cheap bbq sauce and dont offer A1.  So at many places I'll have my burger \"plain\" with no sauce which I believe has given me a ton of experience of what places are serving legit burgers that dont taste dry and flavorless without  sauce smeared on it... And In N Out is king at that regards. Their patties are made so juicy and flavorful you can easily eat it without their spread. I dont like their fries but the burgers are so good and at such a good price I dont mark down my rating for that.  Also their shakes are some of the most affordable I've seen.  And lol at all the haters from the east coast who obviously had their mind made up that In N Out cannot possibly be better than their local favorites before trying them.  As a burger fan Ive tried countless places including favorites from other regions without like shake-shack and Five Guys that I enjoy and visit too.  Is In N Out my absolute favorite burger?  No but its one I keep coming back to the most for their convenience and unparalleled bang for buck ratio.",

Way better than McDonalds!  Oh and the misconception about In-N-Out is that they're more expensive than most typical crappy food chains like McDonald's. Which is not True. For a cheeseburger with the typical vegetables compared to a Bacon McDouble sandwiched in bleach white bread at McDonald's it's the same price.  Excellent quality, employees wear gloves, they are extremely friendly and attentive to the customers needs and don't argue, everything is consistently organized, their coke products are ALWAYS fresh unlike the McDonalds across the street who have ghetto people with shitty ass cocky attitudes and give you hardcore attitude, this place RESPECTS customers.  Don't spend your hard earned money at a crappy place like McDonalds(because cheaper prices mean cheaper experiences). Spend it somewhere that actually respects the money you earn. From what i was told when i tried to get a job there, the employees at In-N-Out actually love their job because of the good pay they earn, the organization of the work, the simplicity of the menu, and the consistency in business they get from the quality they serve unlike McDonalds where the employees feel like they have to work their and hate their lives and only work for a paycheck.",

A local friend of ours suggested this place and wow, was he right on the money- you can't beat it after a night on the town.Loud, bright and crowded even at midnight, the food is fast, cheap and good. Our friend suggested a cheeseburger and fries \"Animal Style\"- I don't know what is  in that  Sauce but it tasted wonderful. Everything was fresh and just so damn delicious,  I  can't shut up about this place! You need to go there!",

When we went to Vegas 2 years ago, I had my first In N Out Burger. We went to L.A. last summer, we got off the plane, got our luggage, got the rental car and proceeded directly to In N Out Burger @ The 405 and Inglewood Avenue.   They can make a burger as big as a 4x4, I got the 3x3 myself with well done cheese fries. The fries are decent, I know a lot of people don't care for them, but the burgers are the best you will ever have.   The location in this review is nice and convenient, its a short walk from New York New York right down Tropicana Ave under I-15. They also have a company store, which we bought some mugs and T-shirts at after lunch.  I always recommend In N Out to friends going to Vegas or Cali.  You're only going to find them in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah, that's the only drawback since they are not franchised.  I wish they'd franchise and open up in the Chicago area, they'd kill out here.",

This West Coast Giant of Burger Making Greatness is, to me and most others, the king of the fast burger restaurant demographic anywhere on planet Earth.  Yes, even including Zimbabwe.    Delicious, simple, delicious, fresh, delicious, messy, delicious and addictive.  And delicious.  It makes me wish I lived in a city with In N Out and grateful to Holy God that I DON'T live in a city with In N Out all at the same time.    The meat, buns, cheese, sauce and veggies (lookin' at you, Animal Style!), and even the tightly-wrapped package, are all exactly what a quick, good burger should be be.  For the record, I'm a 3x3-Animal-style man, no fries, vanilla shake.    This is our one-and-only \"must-do\" on our annual trip to Sin City.  One.  And only.  And we walk for it - about 30 minutes both ways.  And then wait in a crazy long, around-the-restaurant-and-out-the-door line.  It's all worth it.  To In N Out: if you ever move to the Midwest and change your current franchising policy, I will offer you my first-born child and left arm to be allowed to own and operate one of these Bent-Yellow-Arrow joints.",

Terri was the exact opposite of customer service, and they completely messed up my order despite verbally repeating it accurately back at me (the receipt mismatched with my order).  When I started making my order, Terri repeatedly interrupted me with redundant questions, which held up the already huge line behind me (the line curved into the dining area). To make matters worse, Terri scoffed at some points of my order (I was ordering a veggie burger, which is pretty common considering I'm not the only vegetarian/vegan in the world). I had to ask Terri to repeat my order, but they spoke waaay too fast. I had to ask Terri to repeat my order again at a normal pace, which held up the huge line even longer. Just when I thought this couldn't get worse, Terri literallly talked back to me when I asked for my receipt (I felt really sorry for the people waiting in line). Seriously? It's just a piece of paper. Chill.  So guess what? Despite Terri repeating my order accurately, the receipt showed a completely differently order. I had to ask for the pickles when my order was ready, and I guess Terri really didn't want me to get french fries. It's okay, I got fries from Jack-in-the-Box instead. Besides, the line was way too huge for me to wait to in just get some fries.  So yeah.... never coming back here again, lol. In-n-Out didn't live up to its expectations, and so don't expect to get your money's worth here.",

My burger was a flavorful, multi-napkin requiring, mess showing just a bit of pink just as specified. The fries were crisp and savory. I mixed their lemonade with iced tea to make a Pink Arnold Palmer which turned out pretty well actually.  The Twin Cities are a True hot spot for burgers. We have numerous national and local chains as well as many excellent independent establishments. Not to mention being the birthplace of the Jucy Lucy (See: Matt's Bar in Mpls.).

The menu isn't that long and apparently there's some sort of secret menu that I couldn't quite understand. It's fast food, so what's the deal? My coworker said this ain't fast food; but I beg to differ!  I ordered a hamburg and fries. It's suppose to be cooked to order so which explained why it took some time for our order to be ready.   My first impression from the first bite - wow, this bun is soft and moist! Second bite - yes, this bun is amazing. Third bite - the best fast food bun ever!",

The girl then said \"oh It only comes up to a large for water for free\" my friend then insisted It was okay to be charged for the xlarge and she was really thirsty. Then the little girl said \"girl I'm thirsty too but I can charge you for large and give you a medium\" my friend gave up trying to have her understand. I then ordered mines which was a double double protein style and to make the onions grilled onions. She then AGAIN had to play smart with us and say \"ok well some of our burgers don't come with onions so I'll still put that you want onions\"  I didn't ask for her input? And why have burgers with onions in the pictures? And you never want to talk down to a customer like that ever. I understand that no one should ever be walked all over and one should defend themselves BUT there was NOT one moment we ever cussed at her. We didn't give her an attitude from the beginning so what makes It right for her to give attitude?? She needs to be properly trained on how to over come those situations in the future. Because you never know what customers your going to get. You always want to treat customers the right way and if you can't then ask for help!",

    "text": "There are a lot of life mysteries we question everyday. Are we alone in the universe? Does Bigfoot really exist? Is In-N-Out Burger actually that good? Well we may not have the answers to some of these conundrums for a while (unless you've recently been abducted by aliens), but I was able to find a conclusion to that last one.  So maybe I was late to the proverbial party, but I hadn't had the opportunity to try In-N-Out for the first time until I ended up in Nevada back in September. The trek to this spot from Las Vegas Blvd is not as straightforward as one might hope, but I do pray someone reads this review and learns it is walkable, I promise!  Once there, you'll start to get this feeling like you're entering into a genuine food experience. I mean the place isn't spectacularly designed, but between the retro logo and little palm trees across the counter, you get this subtle Californian vibe you didn't know you wanted and you're glad you got.  The line was several people deep, but In-N-Out is a well-oiled machine and lives up to its name with the way it takes orders, calls out numbers, and keeps people moving. Plus, you can't really spend a while choosing because the menu is basic. Burger, Cheeseburger, Double Double (you can figure that one out), fries, and shakes.   Okay, I'm no food novice. There's a little more to that menu than meets the eye, and I wasn't about to miss out on it. Animal style fries? Check. Neapolitan shake? Check. Throw in a Double Double and we're good....well, maybe I let my eyes do the talking because I also added a hamburger to that order (more on its unfortunate demise in a sec).  Verdict? Really good. Aesthetically, the Double Double was beautiful and it stayed together nicely through each juicy, meaty bite. The flavors blended perfectly and created a fast food burger above the caliber of most others. Beyond that staple, I did enjoy my beastly fries, though they fell a tad short of my expectations. I mean cheese, grilled onions, and their secret spread still tasted great on top of it all so don't shy away from this secret selection. The shake rounded things out nicely with its trio of flavors.   Overall, I'm glad to have an answer to that edible life question: In-N-Out Burger is good. I'd say it's even great. Amazing? Maybe not, but I do wish my stomach was big enough to have eaten that extra burger. He met an untimely end in a garbage can along The Strip because I just couldn't eat anymore. Looking back, I wish I did because I'm craving some more In-N-Out and I'll be waiting til my next opportunity to continue to fulfill that food fantasy.",

A part of our order was an animal fries no cheese, animal fries no onion, and a normal animal fries. When we got to the window, the guy had our order wrong, he said a regular fries and 1 animal style fries. We corrected him, he told his coworkers, came back and repeated it to us and it was still wrong. When we tried to correct him again he closed the window on us mid sentence. When he came back, we tried correcting him again and he said \"trust me, I got it right\". When we got to the next window to get our food, we corrected the order and that part was right. However, when we got back to our hotel, we realized he forgot a drink we ordered. The guy at the first window, Jonas, was impatient and rude.  In n out is known for their great food and customer service and its extremely disappointing to have been treated this way.",

It's right off of The Strip, so it's easy to get to whether you're driving or catching a taxi or an Uber. Even though it's busy, the room seems to turn over quickly and the staff does a good job of getting you lined up and through the line. I've never had any issues finding a seat, even at peak times.  And those burgers... I'm not sure if it's because it's a west coast delicacy, the freshness of the ingredients or going animal style, but they really hit the spot.  I highly recommend stopping by, especially if you're visiting and you're not sure when you'll make it out west again.",

Let me start by saying for it being as busy and packed as it was (drive thru and inside) they kept the orders rolling and the wait wasn't long.   While waiting for my food I couldn't help but notice the process of making fries and getting orders together.  Everyone worked so well together and I was impressed by how everyone had their one job to do in the assembly line. There was the potato slicer person, then the person who put the slices in the fryer and took them out, then you had the salter, packer and napkin layer over person. No one stopped or missed a beat in the 10minutes I waited for food.   The burger and fries were great. I like that the fries were fresh and hot. Burger was delicious. I would definitely be back. I want to try the fries with cheese, didn't see it on the menu but I saw people ordering them.",

I am not a fan of pickles and they are the star of the show in their secret sauce. The bun was dry and the meat was flavorless. I also enjoy red onions, not white on my burgers.

Just be wary getting down to this location on the bus from the strip is easy, but there is quite a bit of wait on the way back.  So definitely recommend a Uber or Lyft to return.",

It is a great burger, but not by any means \"out of this world\". I still prefer my Five Guys over any other burger place, even Red Robin gets my 2nd place vote. It's Vegas, so the crowd was intense, so many people, just absolutely packed. People hanging out everywhere, some were panhandling, but not overly aggressive.",

The burger was VERY thin--I would've got a double if I knew. The best part about the burger was the toppings. We got the burgers and one order of fries animal style (secret menu), which was delicious. Animal style includes extra Thousand Island spread, mustard grilled patties, and extra pickles. The fries were freshly made, but they're very plain and not that great. They asked if we were eating in the car or taking it to go, which was nice because they put the food in a box and gave us lap mats. The prices were good for fast food too. My husband would rate this place a 4/5 star, he loved it!! If I had to eat fast food, I would definitely choose this place over any other fast food chain!",

In general the food was good and the same as usual. Customer service was friendly and nice.   In-N-Out is still my favorite fast food, but this location didn't deliver promptly. They were overwhelmed and unprepared.   The line was wrapping around the whole restaurant and the drive thru was equally long if not longer. At least my order was correct and I could get out of there finally after being there for around 30 minutes and that doesn't even include eating. We took our food back to the hotel!",

Let me tell you, this location, maybe all of them at twelve noon is busier than BUSY! I know, it was a week day, lunch time and all that but the line was way out the door and way out into the parking lot. NOW we really had to try it! The line went quick considering the mayhem but the wait to get the actual food after ordering was awhile. Then you have to stand around the crowd to wait for your # to be called out.  I will say, the burger I had was worth the wait but do not waste your time and money on the fries, but that of course if my opinion. Glad to see that they use fresh fries and you can still see some of the skin on them but they were limp, under seasoned and I am 100% sure that the oil they use to fry them in is not near hot enough. I could not finish them. McDonalds still holds the fry trophy. This location has a merchandise store next door to help with overflow parking and seating for those who want to sit outside to eat. let me tell you, you do not want to attempt to eat one of these burgers in your car, not even if you have a rental! Messy goodness! Thumbs up on the nicely valued burger (yum to the extra onions and juicy tomato!) and the pink lemonade. Thumbs down on the long wait and the underwhelming fries.

Why aren't there In-N-Out's on the east coast? We dig your fresh burgers animal style, too. I would recommend checking out their secret menu online before visiting. At least for me, I felt like less of an idiot and more like I knew what I was doing when ordering. I had a cheeseburger animal style, while my boy ordered a double-double, animal style, with a vanilla milkshake. We split well-done fries with cheese. Personally, I like my fries really crisp, and ordering them well-done was perfect considering cheese on top has a tendency to make them more soggy. They were awesome, and the cheeseburgers were probably the best I've ever had from a fast-food joint! The milkshake was good, but not outstanding (I'm not a huge milkshake fan, though). We really loved the whole experience, enough that I considered visiting again the next day. Decided my arteries couldn't handle it, so we will continue to dream of In-N-Out until our next west coast romp... sigh.",

I could talk about this place all day errdayy, but I won't. Service is ALWAYS top notch and when I say always I mean EVERY FREAKIN TIME. Double double with animal fries is the way to go, but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu! WEST COAST FTW",

Now, i'm from California so I get to have In-N-Out all the time, but my friend flew out from New York state to meet me in Vegas. We were out and about on a beautiful Saturday I need to stop off and get something fairly inexpensive but good to eat before kicking off the night's festivities. She had never been before so she trusted me to order for her. I got us a couple of Double Doubles with grilled onions, animal style fries, and chocolate milkshakes. I knew with this order I was creating another convert. Mission accomplished!  This location lives up to the high standard of all of the other In-N-Out locations. The food is fresh and tastes amazing. There really isn't anything quite like the food from this company. Or, at least that's what they make us think.",

After a delayed flight, plummeting blood sugar, a mile-long line & a mini melt down at the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center, I was ready to fight somebody for my first ever In-N-Out meal! I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have, but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.  1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely, adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(  I already knew about the cult \"secret menu\" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double, protein, gem-modified, animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties, lettuce-wrapped with cheese, mustard, tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular, black coffee because I was exhausted from traveling.   I always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin, etc. When I got my meal, I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork, beautiful! (see my pics)  The menu says their french fries are fresh cut, but they kinda reminded me of McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like, looking edges. They are completely different than the darker/limper/potatoey/natural-looking, hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love, but these fries are really friggin' good too, 4 gems!  My 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh, sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large, solid, crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely, tasty bite! That's right, it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than, smh, Five Guys! I never polished a burger, let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it, um 5 gems!  This I&O is bright, large, & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O, you place your order at the counter, your food is made fresh to order, you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly, the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food, not so fast but definitely worth the wait! Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(  A lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's, and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O, the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream, I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!  I&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward, kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies, they have a really cool marketing edge aka \"the secret menu\" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing, Wild West burgers!  I came, I saw, I was In (I devoured), I was Out!! Now, I may just be inclined to catch a redeye to Megas the next time I get a craving, cuz I would do anything for...Good Food!",

This is not exactly a fast food restaurant but they only take about ten minutes to make your food. This place was also very packed so the short wait time was pretty impressive. The downside was that it was not open 24/7.   I got the double-double burger with fries and a vanilla milkshake so I could get the whole experience. The burgers were alright. I think Umami Burger, Shake Shack, and Five Guys have much better burgers. It was really cheap though, around $3.95 for the burger so the whole meal cost about $6 or so. The milkshake was not impressive whatsoever and the fries were terrible. Overall, I am not impressed.",

Yes, for a big place, it was packed with people inside and out. I also noticed there were taxis parked. That's a good sign right. People are paying extra money to get good food.  I love their simple menu. You choose from 3 types of burger, fries, drinks, shakes and that's pretty much it. Yes, I love the simple and basic. I order 2 cheeseburger combos. Even though it was a full house, my order was ready within 10 minutes. I love the efficiency too! You can't tell how the burger by looking at the photo. You gotta eat it to get the full experience. Buns were nicely toasted. The beef patty was soft and juicy. It also had organgy sauce for the burger kind of similar to Big Mac sauce. But it tasted perfect. It came with load of fries and I did tell myself that's way too much fries. I never finish my fries EVER. The French fries were out of this world. It was so fresh. You can hardly taste the oil or grease. As it says on the paper tray, potatoes are cut fresh daily. Sadly, fries were gone in no time. I need to order extra next time. I also got a vanilla shake. It was creamy and thick. It's the old-fashioned way.  Once again, this is the freshest burger AND fries I ever had in my life. I would give 6 starts if I could. I love the old-fashioned way too!",

I'm from the east coast so being able to indulge here is a holiday lol. When approaching you might be deterred based on the huuge crowd and traffic. I was passed impressed on the customer service and speed from the looks i thought i would be in line at least a hr but the staff here is very well trained and efficient. The las Vegas Blvd location probably has 2x the amount of staff that I've ever seen at a fast food spot. Also they have employees constantly cleaning the dining area which is a plus because of the heavy traffic flow soon as someone leaves the table is cleaned and made available for the next customer. Only downside to dine in is you most likely will be sitting right next to someone you don't know. Down to the food... i love these fatty beef burgers topped with processed cheese lol they are delicious, seasoned perfect. Wish i lived closer to enjoy more often. The fries remind me of hardy's/Carl's jr chain which i like also. Love the fact you can order your sandwiches and fries in all the different options that sound weird but really work and taste amazing. Don't forget the secret menu and my fav the \"flying Dutchmen\"",

The place is obviously chaotic because people all want to try it but that's okay. Took about 15 minutes to get our food. I got the double double animal style with animal style fries. Both were good, but I don't know if I'd rush back to the west coast for it. The grilled onions were extremely overpowering too. But you couldn't eat the fries plain, they don't really stand up on their own.   Glad I tried it and got the insta pic, but I'm not running back.",

The first time I wasn't familiar with \"animal style\" but this second visit I was in the know and loaded our burgers up!  Four of us shared 3 burgers and I don't think there was a crumb left after we were done.  As for the fries, those did not travel back to the hotel very well, but were still edible.  Just not crispy and pipping hot as they were the last time I ate at the restaurant.    So whenever traveling out West and you come across an In-N-Out, stop and eat.  You'll be so glad you did.  :)",

Unfortunately, I have only been once in California but never all the times I have been to Vegas. On my last trip to Vegas I made sure that this was on the list of places to eat. Silly enough, I googled \"How to walk to In-N-Out from the Vegas strip\" and low and behold a blog came up with step by step directions, along with pictures, on how to walk from The Excalibur (the hotel I was staying at) right to In-N-Out. It was a short 15 min walk, I could see the sign from the strip! We arrive at the restaurant and the smell of burgers is like a drug and I basically run inside. The restaurant is packed with a decent size line. Fear not, they are a well oiled machine and not even 10 minutes later I am sitting down eating my delicious cheeseburger (animal style) fries and a coke. The burger is perfect. The patty is the perfect size, the toppings are all fresh and the fries are good as well. If you are from the east coast and are in Las Vegas and are staying at The Excalibur, MGM, Tropicana, NY NY, Luxor or Mandalay Bay, this location is super easy to walk to. If anywhere else on the strip, fear not, I saw many cabs dropping people off here. In-N-Out is a must when on the west coast and it must make it's way to the east coast, it just has to!",

The place gets packed with long lines and tough for finding a table but what do you expect?  Employees are working fast with a good attitude - what more can you expect when there are 30 people in line in front of you?  But the wait isn't bad and even the seating, although tight is always clean and fast turning!  Food:  My fave burgers and fries Price:  My kind of affordable Service:  Quick, courteous and positive energy.",

The first thing I noticed was the price of the burgers, I thought it would be more expensive since it's so popular.  I really like the fresh taste of the burgers but I don't like the meat. It's dry and not juicy enough for me. I like my burgers to be overflowing with juice within the first bite. I also didn't like the fries because it wasn't crispy enough. But I love the sauce for the Animal Style Fries.   I also gave this only 3 stars because I'm comparing it to Shake Shack. Shake Shack Burgers is my benchmark so far because of the thicker and juicier beef.",

The burgers are inexpensive, the fries are amazing, as are the milkshakes - and of course, there's the whole secret menu.  I'd like to be able to go here more often to really explore the combinations of what I could do to the secret menu - but I find myself perfectly content with a double/double animal style with extra everything (sauce, pickles, lettuce, tomato and probably other stuff), well done fries with animal sauce (love that cheesy thousand island goodness), and a rootbeer float (covers both my beverage, dessert, and kicks the caloric count up another 1,000 points or so).  Theres a reason this place has so much lore to it - if you havent already, make it a point to go there.  Also, you can have your taxi go to the drive thru - I dont think any cabbie in NYC would do drive thru, plus everything is made fresh and takes under 5 minutes to be served.  It would be nice if this place was a little closer to the strip, but walking back to the hotel post gluttony is a pretty nice way to burn off a miniscule amount of the meal while seeing the real vegas in all its seedy glory.",

Yes, a fast food chain doesn't have to be bad in quality. It's an eye-opening moment you feel on the first bite at this family owned west coast chain.  Quality is good, pricing is right, not-so-secret custom menus are fun, anything about this burger joint is awesome, except one thing - they are SUPER BUSY all the time, which almost disqualifies this place as a fast food destination.  But I wouldn't blame them for doing the right thing and its natural consequences.",

And it was on a Monday night around 11pm... not prime time.  I waited at the first window to pay, but nobody was there.  Then someone finally said to pull up to the next window...when I got to that window, the guy had no idea which order was mine.  I had to tell him what I ordered, and then he gave me the bill.  Then almost forgot to give me my drink after I got all my food.  Consistency is usually great at In N Out...this time, the bread was over grilled, so it was crunchy.  Something petty to complain about, but since I have never complained at an In N Out before, I might as well do it now.  And they didn't give me a bag...only a square cardboard, so the food got cold fast.  I thought I remember getting it in bags on the way out?  Never order drive thru anymore, so maybe things have changed. :(",

The fries were stale and the grilled onions or whatever they put on it was overcooked so it had a weird taste. The chocolate shake was like chocolate cream.

It is best to be on the Ex Caliber resort side as there are no crosswalks or sidewalks on the New York side. It is about a 15 min walk each way (From the NY NY property). You do have to walk under a bridge on a walking path that is a little shady (homeless living there- but still felt safe). Once there you walk to the first stop light with a crosswalk to cross the street and you are at In-N-Out. Food is the typical great quality- served fresh and full of flavor. This was a nice experience to get In-N-Out again. The staff here is very organized and knows how to handle crowds.",

They seem to be sticking to what they know best, yet it's apparent that they have adapted over the years to perfect their offerings. Burgers, fries, and shakes is what's on the menu. Using their ingredients, you can pretty much make any variation you want and fully customize your meal.  The secret menu isn't so secret, as it's basically a manual for how to customize the experience to your liking. I truly appreciate an establishment's willingness to cater to the customer. I myself am a vegetarian, and I look forward to the few times a year that I come across an In-n-Out.  Grill Chz w chilies X chilies X toast & FF Well. To me, that's worth returning.

    "text": "It's kind of embarrassing to come all the way to Vegas (from San Diego) to eat In-N-Out. We wanted a cheap first night so we can be a bit more splurg-y the rest of the weekend, so IN-N-Out it was.  Apparently a lot of other people thought the same because there was a decent amount of people here at 4pm in the afternoon (too early for dinner).  Luckily with my too close for comfort stalking skills, I was able to snag a table for me and my group just as someone was about to leave. As in I stared them down while they hurriedly clean their table for me :)  The cheeseburger I got was pretty standard. Good as always. Cooked well, bread a tad crispy on the edges, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and just enough sauce to flavor it. Fries were good. I loaded them with black pepper and they were good to eat! (that's an understatement if you know how much black pepper I actually eat). And I got my usual half pink lemonade/half sprite mix.   Overall, it was a good first meal of the trip even though the BF literally lives down the street from one in SD.  Oh, and try the cheeseburger with the chili peppers. It gives it really good flavor and spice kick! Be careful of the seeds though (and I tell you this from experience).",

My order is always the same: double double, grilled onions, protein style. 9/10 times, that's all I'll order. Unfortunately because of this location's proximity to the Strip, it is a madhouse at all times. I work about a mile from here and I get 30 minutes for lunch. More than once I've made it back with zero minutes to spare. Once I was 5 minutes late. If it takes more 35 minutes to get a single hamburger, there is a problem. They're too busy for their own good.   The food is spot on but the droves of people make it nearly impossible to find a place to sit. If you are pressed for time, don't even think of coming between the hours of 3pm-8pm whatsoever, on any day of the week.",

    "text": "This was the only place that I had flagged that was a MUST for my trip to Vegas. After drinking all day, we got a cab over the bridge to In-n-Out burger. We got there at an ideal time as right after we arrived, about 9 people walked in.   I ended up going with a two-by-two animal style with fries and a drink. Service was quick and the main guy at the cash was super nice, chatting about menu items with me. The restaurant itself wasn't too busy when we arrived but was very clean and well lit, if a tad sterile.   Yes, this burger lives up to all the hype. No, the fries don't (perhaps if I'd gotten them animal style, they would have, but they were just ok), but the burger is really the gem here. I'm really sad we don't have these in Canada and I'm hoping they either bring them up or that I head to the states again soon to try another one! BOMB burger! Yum!  We were worried we would have trouble getting a cab back but we happened up on a cab driver coming back out of In-n-Out so we got a ride with him. Not sure if that'd be possible all the time though, this location is slightly out of the way so you may either have to walk back or try and find a cab stand somewhere....",

ATMOSPHERE: This location is super busy and it was the closest one to the strip, and nearby some schools as there were a ton of kids walking in.  And the amount of taxis dropping off tourists from the strip (including us) was outrageous.  FOOD: Double Double - My all-time fave.  The simple cheeseburger with spread tastes divine.  I have yet to try this animal style.  Fries -  I finally tried it animal style but meh, not a fan.  I'm more of a purist when it comes to fries.  FEEDBACK: PUT MAYBE 2 or 3 LOCATIONS ON LV BLVD PLZ.  It's so out-of-the-way if you are anywhere on the strip.",

We moseyed off the strip to partake in a lunch of cheeseburgers and animal style fries.  I don't remember In 'n Out always having onion rings on the burgers, but those, the lettuce, and tomatoes added a fresh crispness to the burger.  I only wish the patties were meatier.

    "text": "THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE.  Sometimes you worry that a place will never live up to the hype.  Like Slumdog Millionaire.  Well, you don't have to worry about that with In-N-Out Burger, because it is what all fast food establishments need to strive for.  It is the best of the best.  Clean restaurant, incredibly good service and staff, and most importantly the best fast food you'll ever find.  There isn't much I can say that is negative about In-N-Out.  I guess the only thing is that it's ALWAYS BUSY.  But the line moves really fast, and that's because the service is really good here.  Having a smiling happy and friendly staff goes a long way.  I just feel like your entire experience could change if you saw a long line and a bunch of miserable employees serving them.  I didn't see that, and I appreciated it.  I even asked for a bumper sticker (and felt bad asking given the rush inside), and the employee never gave me a single notion that he was annoyed about this special request.  He went to the back room and grabbed me two of them without thinking twice about it.    Double double animal style, animal fries, neo shake.  That's how I roll.  The neopolitan shake is so thick that the flavors don't become one odd flavor, you get different flavors in every sip.  The burgers are nice and juicy and everything just works together really well.  I find fries boring, but not when they're covered in grilled onions and \"spread\".    We made a point to eat here twice in a 3 day span.  I rarely eat fast food, but just couldn't help myself.  This particular location IS walkable from the south end of the strip.  Coming from the Trop, it took about 15 minutes.  It's a little tricky to figure out, but google \"walking to in-n-out vegas\" or something like that, and you will find detailed instructions.",

The burgers are homemade just like the fries both are delicious, the condiments are a family recipe, and the patties are made to order. I really enjoy the burgers every time I get a chance to visit an In-and-Out location plus I highly recommend this place!  #30daysofYelp",

Went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected, it was crowded- outside parking looked like it would be a hassle but someone backed out right in front of us and we got to take their spot. Inside, lines were organized and not too long and it was easy to snag one of the few available tables. Order came out pretty quick, and once we finished there weren't so many people waiting around that we felt rushed out.   Food was hot, fresh, and delicious, as usual. Got the #2, animal style burger and fries, and made a hot mess of myself. Maybe it's because this place is such a rare treat for me, but I didn't really see the appeal of their regular plain fries- I've heard a couple of people rave about them, but aside from the animal style extras, they're just fries, guys.",

The last thing we wanted to do was fuss over a meal before flying back to rainy Oregon. Thankfully In-N-Out is a staple around Vegas.  I always consider a juicy In-N-Out burger to be the ultimate cap off for any trek back from California or Nevada. There just isn't anything in comparable in the fast food realm back home. Portland is inching closer to having a franchise, but they're still not accessible for most of us yet.  I'm always a fan of the double-double animal style. It's iconic, and the grilled onions with the cheese perfectly melted in the patties just hits the spot. The fries aren't crispy enough to my liking, but I have a feeling it's due to the \"healthier\" oils they use for their fryers.   In-N-Out symbolic in different ways to different people. But it'll always be a place of simple bliss in my book. Hard to go wrong at this price point.",

I was thinking that we would probably have to get our meal to go. By the time we got to the front of the line, there were seats available! We sat down to enjoy our meal. My first bite into the double double was delicious. The toasted bun and sauce with the fresh lettuce and tomato ( I got mine with no onion) worked perfect with the juicy beef patties and melted cheese! Although it doesn't sound any different from a burger anywhere else, there is something different about this one! It's just a unique taste that is indescribable!! The fries, ah to me, wasn't anything special but I didn't know until I looked at the table on the side of us, that you could order it with grilled onions, burger sauce, and cheese!! Maybe next time I'll try it like this! I substituted my soft drink for their shake and boy was I glad I did! Thick creamy strawberry shake! While we sat down to eat our food, we saw the line build up and get extremely long. My number was 70. By the time we sat down to eat, they had reached 100 and started from number one again!! That's how many orders they push out in such a short amount of time! Amazing! If you haven't tried an in n out yet, you gotta try it!!!",

I was watching how they prepared the food and I saw they used a fresh thin patty. I thought the patty was too thin but once I had a bite, it was the perfect proportion. The fries were hard, unsalted, not as good as the burger. We also ordered some animal style. The cheese has almost liquid rubber consistency and the onions atop were on the border of being burnt. I think the saving grace was definitely the burger and the relief of the price of the food compared to all the other options on the Vegas strip.",

While better than my CA foray, a standard double/fries/drink meal, I still found this to be average schlock. It's the Miller Lite of fast food burgers. Popular, but inexplicably. I think I have a go-against-the-masses gene.   A BK Whopper is no fancy fast food burger, but to me it's more Miller High Life. It's the champagne of burgers. Has actual meat and grill/charcoal taste and a good balance of toppings. Fries are way better too! INOB fries are disastrously bad! Like deep fried cardboard!  Simple menu, cheery staff, and a cute look earn this place three stars. How it takes 15 min to get an order also when they have approximately three things on their menu is beyond me and beyond the pale!   Pass!!",

One of my favorite stories of this location is when we were partying at the Palms casino for the Playboy pj party.  Men wore Pj and women wore lingerie.  We partied until 2am and then had the munchies.  Her and her girlfriends went here in barely anything and walked right up to the cashier and ordered the food.  The place got quiet and the cooks still managed to make awesome burgers and fries with half naked women ordering food.    We still to this day laugh about that night.

    "text": "\"Hey Betty, how about lunch at the In N' Out Burger?\" -- Fletch Lives (1989)  I cannot be in the vicinity of an INO and not get a Double-Double Animal Style... I need that sauce coursing through my veins. So my recent trip to Vegas, and a new INO right near the strip (but not within walking distance...no sidewalks), we had to go.  We pulled in right around lunchtime, and the line of cars was spilling out into the street - lucky there is a very large parking lot. We parked and walked in to an equally large line of people - but with 3 registers open, it moved quickly. We opted to take the food to go and eat at one of the picnic tables outside. Our numbers were 30 away when we placed our orders, but getting the food took very little time - so this is a very efficient location.  The food came out perfectly. Hot, flavorful, delicious! I also got an order of animal-style fries (highly recommend, but you need a fork to eat them).   They also have a merchandise store here - not tons of stuff - t-shirts, PJs, tumblers, magnets, etc. Cute and fun if you are big into INO.",

The fries were just OK.   The chocolate shake was excellent, thick and delicious.   I like the fact that it is family owned and that they pay the workers more than minimum wage makes this a great choice.",

The place is clean too, always seeing workers cleaning and sweeping.   Okay, story time. Clumsy me, I wrapped my Invisalign retainers in a napkin and mistaken it for trash. By the time I realized it was gone, we were already on the freeway. I quickly called in n out, but it transferred me to corporate. I explained to the lady what had happened and she contacted the manager. I was already turning back to in n out. When I got there these 2 boys were going through all the trash cans and I felt so bad. I insisted that if it wasn't there, it's fine.  However, one of the boy said to me, that this is fun and he didn't mind at all because it was different and not the same boring routine. He had a positive attitude and was very determined. The fact that he was so happy to do this instead of being grumpy from going through the trash, made it a better experience.  The other boy decided to check the waste in the back and it felt like a miracle! He came out with the retainers in the wrapped napkin, just how I left it. I was so happy I wanted to give him a hug lol. but i didnt! This was all less than 10 mins, when I got int the car, the lady from corporate called me back to inform that they found my trays.   I was really grateful that corporate and the in n out manager had good and quick communication skills. Makes me love in n out so much more.",

I've literally craved going back out west for one of their burgers ever since then...Vegas granted me that opportunity and once again they delivered!   Good God, how I love the burgers and fries here and In-N-Out. From the juiciness of the burgers, to the fries made to damn near perfection to the In-N-Out Sauce, there is NOTHING I can say against the food at In-N-Out, I don't care if it was only my second time eating their food. Only thing about this one in particular that keeps it from being a 5 is...the VERY long wait to get my food. I will admit, when my friend and I were here which was around 6pmish it was very crowded here with no seating left. Luckily she got there before me and saved us a seat but damn...literally waited close to 25 minutes for my food and only ordered two things. Hopefully the service gets better but other than that, In-N-Out, you still reign supreme to me with the best burgers in the country.",

Haha and thanks to learning about the not-so-secret menu, I was able to get my burger \"Protein Style\" too, so no buns here, just wrapped in lettuce! Messier, yes,  but healthier as far as fast food goes, and usually it doesnt.  I NEVER get fast food, I don't mean rarely, or hardly ever... I mean... nevaarr because as Jillian Michaels so elegantly puts it, \"that sh*t isn't food!\". But I'm in the South temporarily and I had to try it once before heading back up to the frigid midwest. The service was of descent speed,  and the food was ok.  I am used to eating majority clean foods, so it made my tum tum hurt a bit, but it was tasty!  I accompanied my burger with a chocolate milkshake, & fries,  I think they literally grab a potato, slice it into fry shape, and fry it up fresh on the spot just for your order... maybe, I think that's similar to how their process works. I didn't get any soda or beverage but the pink lemonade actually did look appealing,  perhaps if I go back again I shall give it a try.  They have ample seating indoors and an outdoor patio with some sunny spots and some shady spots.  The indoor area has booths and tables, which are handicap accessible.  Also, they have a drive-thru, of course as 99% of all fast-food places do these days.  It was fine for a once in awhile \"treat\" or splurge, but I wouldn't make a habit of it. As I write this, and my food has settled, the burps and after taste are quite uncomfortable :-/  I know there is basically a cult following for this place, but I just don't get it.",

The fries is what really got me. It was the absolute worst fries I've ever had. No exaggeration, it tasted like cardboard. Now I see why people order it \"animal style\" to mask how absolutely tasteless their fries are. My friend assured me that it's much better in California (probably True). I made the big mistake of having my first In n Out experience in Vegas apparently.  In conclusion, In n Out isn't that great in Vegas. You should try Carl's Jr. instead which was my favorite.

What are you people thinking!?!  This place is garbage. Like...I would rather have McDonald's than this any day of the week. The recommendation that I got was to order my fries wild/animal/whatever style. Apparently, this is part of their \"secret\" menu, although it's not so secret because every other person in the place had their fries this way.    The burger tastes kind of like a sonic burger, which isn't too bad but the sauce that comes on it is horrid. And those fries... Those disgusting fries. This goop that came on the fries with a bunch of diced onions completely ruined them.   At first, I went back up to the counter to ask for a fork to eat the fries. The place was slam packed, and the girl behind the counter was nice. The next time I went up was for ketchup... Still nice but with a mix of \"you're an annoying customer\". Whatever, I didn't care.   I said this place was packed. The only place available to sit was at the bar style, long table. I had a front row seat to watch the kids yell out people's order numbers. God forbid that someone didn't pick up their order within 10 seconds. The whole crew would start screaming bloody murder. 87!!  Order 87!!!!  87!!!!!!!!!!!

Almost an hour because we took the wrong side of the sidewalk. It was really sad to see the sign of In-N-Out but we couldn't pass through the highway to eat there... We were about to abandon because we were really tired from walking non-stop on the strip for the past few days and it just seems impossible for us to get to In-N-Out. We really had that \"so near yet so far\" feeling!!!   Advice: Do not try to get there from New York New York because there is no sidewalk after you have passed the hotel and all you have is highway and cars driving really fast and drivers calling you crazy. Please take the sidewalk along Excalibur hotel (W Tropicana Ave) and walk straight until you arrive on Dean Dr Martin, then you will see and smell In-N-Out! You can also take the taxi to get there (easier and faster)!  Even before we got there, we could smell their burgers/fries and it smelled so good! There were a lot of people and the parking slot was all filled with cars. It was a little bit hard to find seats for 6 people but we didn't want takeout since it is always better to eat it there, right?   I ordered the animal-style hamburger (with hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, a mustard cooked beef patty; add pickle, extra spread with grilled onions) and an animal-style fries (melted Cheese, Secret Spread that looks like Thousand Island dressing and Grilled Onions). I should have picked the cheeseburger instead of hamburger just to have more textures. I would like to try their Protein style (burger wrapped with lettuce instead of buns) since it sounds \"healthier\".   Although some people find the animal-style a bit too greasy and heavy, I find it perfect since it made the fries even more flavorful! My parents' friends loved In-N-Out so much that they said they wouldn't mind eating this everyday while they are still in Vegas (they loved it more than Shake Shack)!",

You can get them well done or light well too! If you want something a little more meaty you can go for a double double, 3 x 3, or 4 x 4. Any way you go, you won't go wrong here!",

I got \"Animal Style.\" Which is just some chopped grilled onions mixed with some 1,000 island sort of sauce. We ordered four meals including shakes and our bill came out just over $20. So if I were to judge based on price alone, it would be a 5star, because you can't find $5 meals to fill you in much places.   But still, everyone gotta try this place at least once.",

The workers were very kind and pleasant which is not my complaint. My burger on the other hand was burnt to a crisp, there was half a head of lettuce and so much onion on it that I could barely tell there was a burger on the bun at all. The bun was stale and dry and the bottom bun was broken in half which made the whole sandwich fall apart when I tried to eat it...I was so disappointed I just threw it all away. I would have gone back and demanded a different one but I had already made it home and wasn't going to drive all the way back for a $4.00 sandwich.

It was incredible, and I won't go into the details because I'm sure I have embellished them in my mind over the years probably to the point of being food pornography.  This is THE iconic In-N-Out of Vegas. It's right next to the strip, and therefore, YES....IT IS ALWAYS BUSY. Go there expecting a long wait and you won't be as disappointed. They also get 5 stars for the crap they have to put up with from drunks and tourists.  This is also the location I mentioned in another review in which I witnessed a group of 4 walk up to the counter and I overheard this:  GIRL:  Can I just get like a grilled chicken sandwich EMPLOYEE:  I'm sorry we don't have any chicken sandwiches on our menu, just burgers. GIRL:  Really? I don't really like burgers, do you have anything else? EMPLOYEE: (controlling a smirk) No. I'm sorry, just what's on the menu. GIRL:  Okaaaaaaay........ummmmmmm.......I guess let me have a burger, but can I have it with bacon and avocado? EMPLOYEE:  Oh I'm really sorry we don't have bacon or avocado. GIRL: (Turns to boyfriend) Just order me something, this place is stupid! (Walks out of line and plops down in a booth with arms crossed.)  In the words of Jimmy Fallon on SNL: \"Really?.......REALLYYYYY?\"  And for God's sake don't write a review based on how many cars were in the drive-thru....In-N-Out may have ties to J.C. and Bible verse numbers on the cups, but they can't perform miracles...so stay focused on the interactions with the employees and the food.  I would give the company as a whole 6 stars if I could for low prices, quality ingredients, and insanely good and efficient service (This is the only fast food restaurant that can top Chick-fil-A).  But, with that said....Yea....The Fries....They Suck.....Any way you get them......They suck.  My standard order: 3x3 Animal style, light sauce, extra mustard seasoning on the patties, and no pickles with a vanilla shake.",

In my defense we don't have this chain in Canada but after trying it I wish we did.   Such a simple menu, burger or cheeseburger, fries pop. That's it!!! Keeps it nice and easy. Cheap prices too!! I read the Yelp reviews and the consensus was to have a double burger with cheese and fries done animal style. Mmmmmm, ok!!! Loved the burger especially with the grilled onions which in my opinion made it. Freshly made before your eyes and pretty darn good. I tried out the fries animal style which consists of a thousand island type sauce over the fries. I found it to be messy and not my thing but I hear it is popular as hell. The burger is what won me over so it didn't matter too much about the fries.   Always a line-up and that many people can't be wrong. They specialize in the one item and excel at it so it is another gotta go there each time I fly over to Vegas. This is one place that lives up to the hype. So while you are gambling away Junior's college fund keep $3 change in your pocket and get something for your money but be warned after one bite this too will be an addiction.",

They're simple, not greasy (for french fries) and unlike any other fry I've ever tasted.  They've got a really unique texture...I can't explain it.  I love mine with that horribly good slice of cheese on top of them.  The double double is just perfect as well.  I'm not a big fan of fast food hamburgers, but I could eat these burgers several times a week!  The special sauce is like a thousand island dressing (think Big Mac), but it's not as tangy as the typical thousand island topping.  The 2 patties are thin, but not too thin.   Even though this location is super busy, the employees are always super nice and very patient with newbies.",

Even if i'm there for a short weekend i have to have it twice. And Vegas was no exception.  I was staying at the Mandalay Bay, and i heard from people that it's walkable, but it was so hot (May '09) i didnt want to melt to death on my way there and not taste those amazing animal style fries before i die, so i took a cab. Got on the cab, didnt want to risk the cab driver driving away or keep the meter running, so we went through the drive thru and drove right back to the hotel. I dont think the round trip was more than $15, might have even been like $10. Either way, it was worth it.   My usual is double double animal style with animal style fries. At first i thought that the animal style fries would be over doing it, but i have to say if there is one bad thing about In-N-Out is their fries, kinda plain. I guess i'm just used to the greased up mcdonalds fries :P but when it's topped with cheese, thousand island-like dressing and grilled onions?? heaven.  gosh i'm drooling just thinking about them!",

At first I was hesitant to walk here because when you search on Google maps, you basically see that it's located near a highway and think it's not pedestrian friendly and may not be safe. However, there IS an underpass (??) for pedestrians to get here...although definitely NOT kid-friendly.   ***TIP***  To get here, you should stay on the side of the Excalibur hotel  Anyways, I got two Double Double, Fries (Animal Style!!) and a large Neopolitan Shake. It was EXTREMELY busy but the staff were friendly, pleasant, and VERY hardworking. Finally got my food, bit into it, and I thought WOW~ I think I just bit into one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had in America!! I would say compared to Shake Shack, In-N-Out burgers are scrumptious and they taste MUCH fresh and their fries are cut small, not super-oily, and are filling. Their shake was SUPER thick and tasty as well!! After you finish your shake, you can use the same cup to get a refill on the soda machine so be sure to get the shake instead of the soft drink so you can get both!! :)  Wish In-N-Out makes a debut in NYC sometime to compete with Shake Shack just like Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf did to compete with Starbucks...",

Still, it IS an In-N-Out, and less than perfect is still way better than the other fast food competition. Other people in the area agree, the line out the door and the line for the drive-thru going out into the street and almost to the I-15 on ramp while the other fast food neighbors are pretty dead is telling: everyone loves In-N-Out, including famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.  Except my ever hungry friend.  He wasn't impressed. He expected a large menu of every burger combination possible complete with foie gras and shittake mushrooms. Sorry, this isn't that sort of place. Here they keep it simple, honest, and fresh.  He didn't get it. It's not gourmet fanciness, it's just a good burger and freshly cut fries. If a place doesn't have dancing Asian midgets and a full appetizer menu on which he could order the whole page at a time it isn't for him. I can't blame him though, this location wasn't as good as I've had before, but it was close enough since we'll probably never see one of these on the east coast ever..  One thing to note, there's a company store that sells In-N-Out swag right next door. If you're a fan, go there.",

It's always busy and I mean always busy, no matter the time of day. The only exception that I have seen is Thanksgiving day, because they are closed. Don't worry, I got over it and went the next day.  The wife is on a no meat kick, so she tried their grilled cheese. Basically it's a no meat burger prepared how you like with your favorite toppings. She also got a side of fries. I get my usual 2 double doubles animal style hold the tomato and lettuce. Don't get me wrong, I like lettuce and tomato, they just get in the way and make things messy. So no lettuce and tomato means problem solved. And the customary neopolitan shake was my drink to wash down my burger goodness.   It was a great way to end another great day in Las Vegas.",

We got 3 doubledouble animal style, 2 fries, 3 shakes for $20.81.  Burgers are pretty darn good, and they wrap it good to help keep it from becoming a messy disaster.  Shakes are thick and tasty too.  Chief complaint, fries are dreadful.  I swear they were better 3 years ago.  Last year we came in, and a worked overheard us complain, and she brought us a fresh order, and they were still dreadful.  And they were the same this trip.   I cant put my finger on why.  Yuk.  Did they switch something up? This store has a gift shop attached, if you're looking for inexpensive vegas brand memorobilia, this is a good place for it.",

I'm from the East Coast, so this was my first experience with the famous In-N-Out Burger, which I found to be a lot of hype so we went there on 2/12/13. My friends and I asked our taxi driver to go through the drive thru window here because I wanted to check out what all of the fuss over this place was about. I got the Double Double Animal style w/ fries and a lemonade to drink. I enjoyed the burger, but felt it tasted almost exactly like a Big Mac from McDonalds (maybe a little fresher). The fries weren't seasons very well, if at all. While I enjoyed the food, I just didn't feel it was anything worth mentioning, and certainly not worth driving a distance away for.   For all my friends on the West Coast always telling me how great this place is, I was anything but impressed. It wasn't too expensive for the burger, fries and a drink, but it also wasn't a bargain either. I'd much rather have a Five Guys burger and fries, than back here at In-N-Out Burger.",

Just a young pup who was lucky enough to have the coolest cab driver in the city, he took me on a out-of-towner tour of this great town (sounds like the start of a bad movie but really wasn't; I'm still around to tell it) which led to the final stop at my request: In-N-Out.  Not used to waiting for fast food since I've never been to this establishment, the cab driver even held the meter for me.   Sorry to say it was not a wild and crazy Hangover-style time in Las Vegas, but this was a highlight (that sounds sad to some of you all, I know).   Now that I have access to In-N-Out, it loses some of its cache, but nonetheless, I fondly remember this Las Vegas location.   I think the phrase 'you never forget your first' fits in well here.

Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and still highly recommended!  However, I have learned that everything tends to taste much better to people who have been consuming mass amounts of alcohol.  For out-of -towners unfamiliar with In-N-Out, it is a must try!  There menu is simple and excellent.  There are only a few things on the menu, but it is about as good as fast food gets.  They also have a secret menu where you can customize your meal a ton of different ways, but I would suggest that first timers stick to the basics.  I got the #1 combo when I visited here.  It consisted of a Double-Double ( a burger with double meat and cheese), fries, and a fountain drink.  It was not as magical as my friends made it out to be, but it really hit the spot for me and was super tasty.  I am always down for some In-N-Out, and this location did not disappoint!",

For purity's sake, I tried them plain, with just cheese, and animal-style. Each time, the fries seized up into a warm potato brick almost immediately after serving.   The burger is a decent burger, I will give them that. But they have never gotten my order right. I wouldn't care so much except that I have numerous severe food allergies. I asked for a single cheeseburger, plain, with pickles and ketchup. What did I get? A double double with cheese, lettuce, onions, and mustard. I ate it because I was starving... But it's like a normal-size version of White Castle. Not worth the trip across I-15.  The iced tea was decent and the burger was filling, but I will not return for a fourth visit.",

I've only heard things. I passed this place up the first time I was in Vegas, but not this time.  Getting there walking isn't bad, but if you're trying to get back to New York New York where our party was, it is a hassle. The sidewalk does not loop around, but oh well. Plus I think we cut through (illegally) a parking garage. There will old slot machines every where. I think it was good that we weren't being followed. If someone saw us run down a rock hill and hope myriad fences, they would have thought we robbed a place.  Speaking of robbed, you are a victim if you have NOT tried this place. Protein style: no bun, two patties, tomato and onion. It's amazing how grilled euphoria patties can garner such a reaction out of my simpleton self.   In and Out. You rock!",

I had a double-double meal and I was very underwhelmed with the burger, it just didn't seem to have a whole lot of flavor to it. I ordered it without the sauce or onions as I don't like them, so maybe people who like onions like the burgers a lot more? The fries were okay, but nothing to write home about.

    "text": "OVERALL: OK for a quick bite? Sure.  Slightly better than a normal fast food place? Sure.  Perhaps 3.5 stars if I'm rating it as \"Fast Food.\"  Overall though, even if there were I&O's near me (Central Connecticut), I can't imagine I'd eat there often.  I'd equate it to Skooters in Windsor Locks, and can quickly rattle off numerous other burger places I'd rather go (some pseudo fast-food like White Hut, Shady Glen, and Five-Guys, some real restaurants like Catsup & Mustard, Ted's Montana Grill, Bobby Flay's Mohegan, Red Robin).   FOOD: I don't get it. A lot of hype, if you ask me.  The burgers were better than normal fast food, sure, but they weren't really that great.  The texture is nice and pleasing, and it  tasted a bit more like beef than McD's/BK, but that's not saying much.    And the fries...blech.  Flavorless shoestring.  I have a nearly offensive level of appreciation for ketchup, and the fries made me ALMOST say \"screw it\".  The fries at Five Guys are much much better.   SERVICE: Ordering was quick, but the wait after wasn't.  We had to wait absurdly long because their printer stopped working, and the guy I assumed was the manager didn't notice since he was busy flirting with a customer, (While the place was packed...flirt on your own time, not mine. Thanks.).    Cleanliness was pretty damn good for a fast food place, particularly considering how crazy busy it was...I have to give them that.   ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: It peeved me that for our takeout they just threw ketchup packets on top of uncovered fries.  Thanks for reaching your dirty mitts into the ketchup packet bin, and dropping it all right on my food. Sure I'm going to be touching those potentially dirty packets with my fingers, and then eating with the same hands...but I don't need I&O skipping that step.   Next time I'm on that side of the country it'll be Fat Burger time. A little birdie tells me that place is better than In and Out.",

I typically get a single burger animal style with fries animal style with a strawberry shake. Why the animal style you say? BECAUSE IT'S LEGIT!

I have to say that although the prices were cheaper than comparable fast food burger places, the overall burger was nothing to rave about. I prever NY Shack burgers anytime.  I am really not sure if people like it because one cannot find it on the East Coast or what exactly brought the popularity of these burgers because for me it was inferior in taste even to McDonalds (and I am talking purely on taste, no doubt anything is better quality than McDonalds).",

French fries not so much.  And you would think the milk shakes would be made with ice cream, but alas no milk shake mixers here.  It's from a machine like Mickey D's.  If you've ever had french fries from Five Guys, those are GREAT french fries.  These were bland french fries.  I guess people get them animal style to make them tolerable.

    "text": "Besides how great the price is for a burger, fries and a shake which only cost like 7 bucks for everything. In-N-Out  Burger is by far one of  worst burger joints I've been to.    My friends and I came all the way from Philadelphia to Las Vegas for a Bachelor Party.  We stopped in In-N-Out for a bite to eat before we hit the strip.  We ended up waiting a half an hour just to eat.  This place was pack tight.  There could have been fire code violations for how crammed it was in this place.  I figured it must be good if I am waiting this long. So I waited and waited and pretty much waited some more.   Order Numbers where all over the place. Order number 56, 48, 27, 57, 58, 69 etc.... It gets a bit frustrating when you think your next but in reality your not even close.    Finally I got my burger and sat down with my friends hoping for a delicious bite of a juicy burger.  My first bite was pretty much my last.  Figuring to buy a double it would be big enough to fill my appetite but that wasn't the case.  The burger was fresh but not that great in a taste category.  My milk shake was the thickest milk shake in the world.  It coated my throat with a chocolaty mess, which it ended up giving me a stomachache.    By far the best thing to order was their french fries.  They are made from real potatoes and you can watch the fri-guy put the potatoes in a contraption and cut them up.    Other then crappy burgers and horrible milk shakes, I would hold off and not  waste your time just to get some decent fries.  Stick with paying a little extra and getting something better.    My Vegas trip could have done with out In-N-Out.",

They're completely bland... the insides are not thoroughly cooked.... and well, I'd take ANY chain's fries over theirs!  But but but, the animal style burger was very good. And the price tag was even better. We were completely sticker-shocked after spending a few days in Vegas. Side note here but if you ever wander up and down the strip, take note how much a cup of coffee costs at Starbucks. Outside the casinos: $1.40. Inside the casinos: $2.80+ Soo... how can a burger cost $2??? Which, of course, just made me even more angry that night when I paid $46 for the Wynn buffet...  I would definitely recommend getting the burger animal-style... bf likes his burgers \"classic\" and he got screweddd. what a sucker. The difference lies in the pickles, the caramelized onions, and the sauce. He got... I don't even remember what was in it besides tomato, lettuce, and cheese because I took a bite and went \"HA!\" then continued eating mine.  Still, West Coasters need to stop prancing about In-n-Out like it's the queen of freaking Sheba. One friend (from California, mind you) claimed the burgers in the LV joint weren't as good as the ones from California. For that, I call his big fat bluff. But I could go for a double double animal-style right now...  I really was just referring to the burger, guys.",

I've waited no longer than 15 minutes in line to place my order and even less time for my order to get filled.  Kudos to them as they work very hard to make sure everyone gets what they ordered.

I even dressed up as an In-N-Out girl for Halloween.  One Halloween my girlfriends and I decided to dress up as fast food girls instead of the usual bunnies, french maids, hookers, dominatrix, pirate wench's, basically the usual excuse for them bitches to dress up as sluts. We had a Krispy Kreme girl, A Hot dog on a Stick girl and me the In-n-Out girl.  I bought my shirt from their souvenir shop next to the restaurant. I also bought my hat, my apron and my larger than life safety pin to hold it all together. The souvenir shop sells it all.  We went out that night and realized that we looked quite normal. My girlfriend got out her scissors and started cutting out our shirts, cutting our shorts shorter. So basically we were Fast Food Whores. I guess Halloween is really the one day of the year it's okay to be a slut.  Sorry bout the rant, I love In-N-Out. 5 stars.",

I don't have to tell you it's worth it.  Because of this location's proximity to the Strip you'll be hard pressed to avoid a longish wait time and find a place to sit. Wait it out and you'll be rewarded with a tasty burger (and fries and a milkshake... you ordered all of those, right?). It might be one of the better hangover cures you'll experience in Vegas.",

After the suspicious taxi ride loop around the highway to get to the restaurant I finally arrived and ordered after waiting shortly in  line.  What nostalgia I had built up in my head since my last burger led to disappointment.  It may be this particular location because the ones in California I remember tasting much fresher and better.

All I can tell you is that it lived up to the expectations I had. My burger was made fresh and I could tell that the patty hadn't been previously frozen. As my meal was being prepped, I could see the kitchen crew cutting fresh French fries in the back. My milkshake was thick, chocolatey and creamy - just how I like it. I have no doubt that I'll be hitting up In-N-Out Burger each and every chance I get... In fact, I may have to make a trip back to the the southwestern U.S. for that purpose alone!",

Well worth the wait for something that's truly made fresh in a fast food atmosphere.  I also love the shakes.  Too bad they're only served in one size.  Or maybe that's a good thing for my calorie count.  This particular location is always packed.  I drive home around midnight every night and I've stopped through the drive-through and it's a solid 10 minute process or more.  I'm not sure if it's a tourist thing being near the strip, but this one is slower than most.  That's saying something since most In-N-Outs are always busy.  I'd suggest the In-N-Out in the northwest part of town for faster service.  The only thing I am not impressed with are the fries.  I hardly ever get fries here.  It's a waste of time.  And of course there's the famed secret menu.  Look it up on the internets and you can find out how to get a grilled cheese and the like.  Good times.",

Apparently, you're supposed to order a burger & fries in 'animal style' which isn't even on the menu. I mean, how dumb is that? You have a menu for a reason: so your customers can order something really good off of it and that 'really good' option isn't even offered on the menu? I was not impressed. The only reason I enjoyed it was because I was drunk for 3 days straight. Portillo's ALL DAY.",

Totally worth the possibility of passing out from ridiculous 135 fahrenheit temps that make Vegas, Vegas.   I love In-N-Out... They have my favorite burger of all the burgers I've had... Originally being from southern California, I may be biased about it, but Double-Doubles are so amazing... And I eat a lot of burgers in a lot of places.  The sweetness of the sauce compliments the saltiness of the patties, contrasts the mildness of the cheese, compliments the crispness of the lettuce/tomato, contrasts the chewiness of the buns...  The fries are great too. Not overly crisp, not soggy, lightly salted, fried in vegetable oil, and cut to order.  They just stick to what they know and what the do well. Not over complicating the menus and keeping it simple. (even the \"secret menu\")  (Yup... Im copy/pasting all my reviews for In-N-Out... I've yet to have a negative experience at one...)",

They have a great staff and get you through the line quickly and get your food out HOT.  If you have never been, the menu consists of hamburgers, fries and shakes.  Non meat eaters beware.  They have options that are not on the menu, search \"In-N-Out secret menu\" online to find your options.  My typical order is a double double cheeseburger, animal style with chopped chilies. I love that the fries are so fresh that you can see them being cut in the kitchen right before they are fried up for your enjoyment.  Turnover is pretty quick as far as tables go, at the time that you arrive if you don't find a table, just wait for your food and one will open up.",

There is also a gift shop next door  to this location so you can get your in n out merch without paying shipping fees. I hadn't been to this location in a minute because I experienced some issues with my order not being correct which is hardly the case with in n out but I have been by recently several times and it's been on point. I ask for my burger different ways depending on what sounds good each time and my order has been just the way I order it. I go inside sometimes but the drive thru works best for me because getting a place to sit inside at this location can take longer than it takes to get your food more times than not. Being near the strip and one of the first recognizable signs coming into Vegas it's a given that this place will be popping. If you like chilies then ask for chopped chilies on your burger and thank me later.",

I personally don't like all of these in-n-out vs Five Guys arguments cause the two joints are too different to compare. In my mind, they satisfy different cravings. Can't we all just get along?  Got a double double and some fries animal style when I was in Vegas my first time, and it hit the spot. Also, the fries tasted more like potatoes than at any other fast food joint I've tried, so that was a pleasant surprise. Pairs well with Pedialyte.",

    "text": "My first encounter with In-N-Out was as a high school junior, visiting colleges in sunny California. My relatives promised me to make a pit stop at In-N-Out before my flight back to NYC and my heart filled with hope as we pulled up to the parking lot just to see that it wasn't opened!   5 years later I returned to the In-N-Out in Vegas! I was a complete noob however - thinking that ordering a 2x2 animal style made me a In-N-Out insider. Boy was I wrong. When I returned a few months later I had my bombdiggity order ready:  *Well-Done animal style fries (Well done is a NECESSITY. Otherwise the fries legit become soggy messes under the special dressing + onions that look like bacon). *Extra toasted bun (always order the bun first), medium rare animal style single w/out pickles, w/ a whole grilled onion, cut in half. *Neapolitan Shake (Chocolate + Vanilla + Strawberry)   The wait was minimal as it was around 10:30-11PM on a Friday night. Probably took about 10 mins for our food (it's fresh, never frozen!). My only complaint was that the bun was kinda cold :( I also could have done without the shake (suuuuuper thick). Other that that the food was fabulous + the fact that it's so affordable makes In-N-Out a staple whenever I'm in the West Coast!  P.S. There are no cabs readily outside...but cabs do stream in on a regular basis. We had to wait maybe 3 minutes before one came through with more patrons =)",

We couldn't believe how packed it was at 3PM. Further disbelief came from how quickly we got to order, even though I bet there was 50 people ahead of us in line. We also were blown away by how quickly we received our order. The seating is limited, but the 2 times we were there people were kind enough to budge up to free 2 seats for us, even if it meant a few parties had to mingle. All part of the fun!  And did it live up to its hype? Yeesh! We were instant fans! One nice thing about a simple menu is that a place gets really good at doing things right. We even saw them chopping up potatoes for their fries, right there at the restaurant! No bags of frozen spuds!  Restaurant was clean, service was cheerful and efficient, food was Uh-MAZING, and the prices were so low......it's now the first place we stop after arriving in town and the last place we stop before leaving!  P.S. If you're the tourist type (when in Rome!) visit the gift shop next door. Every t-shirt has something special in it. The tee I got has a roadster with the members of ZZ Top in it rolling through an In-N-Out Burger drive thru. Rob's tee has the original owners in his  drive thru. Kinda cool!",

In-N-Out is the only burger which I actually will tolerate American cheese, something that I've never been a fan of.

I already have a review at another In n Out, but again i will say that the best is when you take it to go. I say that because i highly recommend to ask for it to go in a box with a lid because it will trap the moisture in the box and the fries will become soft, that's how i personally like it because unfortunately the fries do become hard quick if you don't do this process.  This is the busiest location in Las Vegas. Since of course it right next to strip accross the strip. The longest i ever waited was 45 min to get my food after placing my order, but of course the line wrapped around all the tables in the restaurant. You'll run into tourists all the time that literally will get off the plane and drive straight here before even going to their hotel. And you'll always see taxis also with tourists. It's definately an adventure. The didning room is also slightly bigger due to how busy it gets.  Go try it!",

    "text": "I love In-N-Out Burger. I salivate over the Animal-Style double cheeseburger + fries and a diet soda. So bad for you, but so good. No, it isn't the best, meatiest, most original burger ever, and the fries are kind of soggy sometimes and forgettable, but all that is meaningless when you pull in, expecting to either stand around and cast a hawk-eye for any soon-to-be vacated seats in the crowded eatery, or resign yourself to consuming your greasy feast in your car, made that much better by In-N-Out's well-executed cardboard container trays.   I like the reputation of In-N-Out for being a good company, who treats it employees well and pays them decently. I like how this reputation seemingly trickles down to my actual experiences with the employees, who are always chipper and efficient (sans Chick-Fil-A's sometimes eerily robotic, hyper cheeriness). I like that the restaurant I frequent when I'm in Vegas always seems to be quite clean, and that the price is so reasonable for a luscious burger and fries with a drink ($7 and some change). I appreciate the nifty cardboard container trays that display your food neatly so you can consume on-the-go, in your car, or if necessary, standing up because there are no seats available. And goodness, that legendary \"Animal-style\" burger is so, so delicious: two thin, crispily-laced burger patties, cool crunchy pickles, melty hot cheese, grilled onions that manage not to reek, and richly fatty sauce, all sandwiched between two warm, soft but sturdy buttery/toasted buns. Add those little shoestring fries and an ice-cold Diet Coke and I am SO HAPPY. And, although the feast is a caloric bust, I don't feel gross and sickly like I do after eating at most other fast food chains.  SO good, I guess it is a good thing for my waistline that there isn't an In-N-Out in my residency.",

They are quicker (car by car) than any location here so the most organized well operated drive thru probably at any fast food type place.

    "text": "This is the best fast food experience you can have. Period.  Having recently been to a bunch of burger places I felt I was ready to see where In-N-Out would rank. I ordered a double double animal style, fries, and a strawberry shake. Every one of those items was outstanding.  First off, the restaurant is very clean despite being completely packed. All the staff were nice and helpful, not a surly employee in sight. I was impressed at how quickly the line moved and that the wait for the food itself was short considering I was here at the height of the lunch rush.  My burger was fantastic. Extremely flavorful on its own, but in tandem with the cheese, sauce, veggies, and bun everything came alive. I think the meat patties at Shake Shack may be a *little* bit better, but the superior bun and sauce more than make up the gap for In-N-Out. The fries were perfectly cooked and the shake was the epitome of a strawberry shake.  Here's the real kicker though- the price. This is the location right by the Vegas strip. Having ordered basically the same thing at Shake Shack I was prepared for a $20 price tag. But no! It  came out to $8 and change! You simply cannot get a better deal for your money.  Is In-N-Out a reason to move out West on its own? No, but it's certainly a start.",

I consider them very average burger joints and would actually give them 3 stars if they weren't so overhyped.  I hear so many rave reviews that I keep giving them another chance but am always disappointed.  It's kind of like going to see a blockbuster movie after reading the book.  It's never as good as you expect.  The people who haven't read the book really like the movie but it's still not the same.  That's how I feel about In-N-Out after being spoiled by eating at better burger places, it's just not up to par.  At least the prices are reasonable but that still doesn't make it worth the typically long wait.",

You know, like animals make burgers.

I ordered a Double Double Animal style along with Animal style fries and a chocolate shake to wash it all down. I had been drinking all the free booze while gambling and needed something greasy and heavy to calm my stomach and line it for...well, more drinking.  The burger was good, hot, a little messy...which is a good thing in my book. The thousand island dressing didn't drown out the fried onion flavor on the burger or fries and the tomato and burger still had some room to show off their flavor too. It wasn't a let down, it was quite good. Better than Five Guys? No way.  This joint is right off the 15 so don't expect to walk there if you're staying at a hotel on the strip. Grab a cab and head out. The employees at this In-N-Out were attentive, efficient and very polite. They were slammed right after I got my food and they kept the line moving.",

    "text": "I'm no longer an In-N-Out virgin! I waited all day in my only day in Vegas to make the trek walking from the Strip over to eat the burger I had heard so much about: double-double animal style. Was this likely the best decision before attempting to run my first ever half marathon? Likely not, but we'll look past this for now.  The trek, while a touch long, especially if you're trying to conserve your energy and legs for a run, is not impossible. There are a few tricks to the walk, including making sure you're walking along the same side of the street as the Excalibur and non New York, New York on your way across the freeway. When the sidewalk splits, make sure you take the right path, not the left, as this will lead to the bridge over the freeway.  Anyway, enough about walking there and on to the food. At 2 pm in the afternoon, the place was packed, but the cashiers moved through the line efficiently. Within 5 minutes, I was up at the front and placed my order for a double-double animal style with fries and a vanilla shake.   I then proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be made. The burger definitely didn't disappoint. Nice and juicy with good flavors. Best burger ever? Not even close, but for a fast food burger, it definitely ranks up near the top.  The fries, however, were disappointing. Little flavor. For a fast food fry, I have to give the edge to Five Guys on this one.  The shake was nice and thick and vanilla-y.  Overall, if you haven't ever been to an In-N-Out and are looking for a cheap Vegas meal option, it's worth the trip over the freeway.",

Needless to say I made an about face and went to the drive through. Considering the lines inside I thought I would be waiting quite a bit in the drive through lane. That however was not the case. I did have to wait but it was noting like you would expect from approx 7-9 cars lined up.

This is the closest In and Out to the Strip (Bellagio, Monte Carlo, New York New York, Paris, etc). It is a reasonable walking distance and gives you a fantastic reason to order 2 double doubles animal style instead of just 1.   Ok, maybe it was just that one thing...  All in all, everything that you would expect from an In and Out. Fairly clean, and quick service. Burgers were extremely tasty as usual and they have indoor and outdoor seating. And if you get tired after eating and don't want to walk back, they often have taxis waiting outside to take you back to your hotel!",

But the rest of the people in the car wanted In-N-Out, and I wasn't driving.  But, the taste and quality was just like home. I got the cheeseburger, animal-style. (And if you don't know what that means, ask somebody who works there. Or eats there often.) And a shake. In-N-Out still makes the best burger anywhere, whether it is in Nevada, Arizona or California.  This location has a merchandise store next door where you can buy all kinds of In-N-Out T-shirts, hats, etc., etc.    Maybe next time I'll order a vanilla shake and a small drink, get some root beer and make my own root beer float.

The cab driver actually said he gets a ton of people from the strip who just want him to drive to In-N-Out. He was right as there were a ton of cabs cycling through the parking lot which made it easy to get one to drive us back to our hotel. I was ecstatic to try this place as I am a huge Five Guys fan and wanted to compare the two for myself.   I was so disappointed. When I order a hamburger, I am looking for something that I know is detrimental to my health. It's a hamburger! The burgers at Five Guys are greasy as hell and give me a stomach ache after I consume one. I ordered the animal here and it honestly just seemed too healthy to me. It was good but it didn't satisfy that burger craving. I can see how people like In-N-Out over Five Guys but it really just depends on personal preferences and I just happen to be on the other side of the fence.",

    "text": "Ok, go ahead and tar and feather me, but I must tell it like it was for us on this trip.  We just returned to Texas after a two week trip to Vegas.  This particular In-N-Out Burger has a sign right next to I15 that reaches to the sky which calls many autos off the freeway.  It also got to us as we headed to our hotel!  First, it was so crowded that we should have taken our clue from that.  The line to order went all through the entire restaurant and there was not a clean table in the place.  My husband got in line and I finally found a table someone was abandoning and claimed it for us.  In a corner just for two.  When my husband finally arrived I was thrilled to see the burgers, fries, and drinks, as In-N-Out is my favorite burger joint in Vegas and CA.  Well, one bite and I had wished we were at Jack-in-the-Box!  Very small piece of meat, dried out, and just awful!  Fries?  I don't even know how to describe them.  Needless to say, this ruined our going to another In-N-Out the entire trip.  Usually we make 2-3 runs to one when we are in Vegas, as TX's has none.  I guess they don't have to be so up-to-par as the others since most of their business comes from the freeway and the stip.  Next time it's out to the \"regular\" neighborhoods for a good In-N-Out Burger!",

It's also been a good 5 or so years since I've pretty much stopped eating fast food. With that being said, the bathing suit portion of my trip was over so I was a little excited to indulge a little.    There was a line wrapped around the building but it didn't take more than 5 minutes to order. It probably took about 15 minutes to actually get our food. I had requested the animal sauce on the side, however they put it on my double-double anyways. I was not waiting for them to fix their mistake so just took it. I also got an order of fries.   So it tasted like a fast food burger. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. I absolutely did. I just didn't have that east coast girl meets west coast burger euphoric experience. Although to be honest, I didn't love the animal sauce. A little too creamy/mayo-like for me. I would have preferred if my burger wasn't smothered in it.   Big plus: it was probably the food I ate all weekend that wasn't overpriced.   I'm glad I did it, but I'll probably be sticking to local cuisine next time I cross paths with an In-N-Out.",

Let's start off with the pros of this place: Everything is made in-house. They literally put the spud in the slicer in front of you! The milkshakes are the creamiest milkshakes I've ever had so this definitely was the highlight of my night!!  Now the cons: The burgers are overly salty. Saltier than I am when I'm trying to get my revenge on the person that cut me in traffic. The fries, although are perfectly made, are not perfectly seasoned. The cheese is bland. The animal style fries are also salty. Maybe we just got a bad batch and someone accidentally poured the entire tub of salt in our order. Maybe west coast folks just don't have that taste bud anymore and anything remotely salty to us southerners are normal to them.",

For the price you pay you can't complain for what you get and you get some great stuff.   Honestly, my favorite part was the burgers and I highly recommend getting the double stack. The fries were decent, but I wasn't super impressed by them. Although the animal style made them awesome, I'm not a huge fan of soft/soggy fries and I like my fries with a bit more crunch. Overall, I loved them and will definitely come back so 4 stars from me :)",

And the place was clean, there was a staff member going around cleaning the empty tables, and making sure the free tables are clean and ready to use.

    "text": "The BEST Burger in fast food.   A Double Double Animal Style is the superlative burger in a fast food restaurant I have ever had and it could very well be the best burger I have had period. New York's Shake Shack is the only burger that I would say is even on this tier of excellence. That said, In-N-Out Burger is the mother of all burgers and at its price point, it is the cheapest gourmet experience you could possibly have. This is not hyperbole.  The menu is basic and just about everyone knows about the worlds worst kept \"secret\" menu but if you just woke up from a 40-year coma, a simple google search will provide all you need to know. I always go animal style which is the basic Double Double along with added pickles, extra spread, grilled onions, and mustard fried onto each meat patty. Six dollars gains you admission to Heaven.  This specific location is a complete tourist trap complete with a store pimping out branded Hats, Shirts, Stckers, and anything else you can think of. The restaurant is gigantic compared to the average In N Out in SoCal. With that in mind, try to avoid the 11:30am to 1:30pm rush in you can, it can get packed in this beezy! They move the lines with incredible efficiency so it is actually finding seating that becomes the issue, even after they added tables outdoors in a recent addition. I suggest you go now.  Once again, In-N-Out is BEST Burger in fast food.",

Considering we can't get it in the East Coast, we knew we had to make this our final destination. So we stopped here for lunch right before heading to the airport and let me tell you, it was worth the hustle.   In-N-Out out burgers are pretty darn GOOD. They are so fresh and juicy. I'd recommend ordering your hamburger/cheeseburger/double-double Animal style off of their special menu which includes extra Thousand Island, mustard, grilled onions, and extra pickles. Yes, it will add some extra cals to your meal but it is definitely worth it so just do the damn thing!   The fries are a little disappointing. Nothing to hate about them, but they are so basic when compared to the burger. If you're trying to sacrifice something from your meal, skip the fries, or maybe ask for Animal style fries as well!  The line was huge and wrapped around the entire restaurant, but the staff worked quickly and efficiently. We were cutting it pretty close to our flight time, but our burgers were ready just moments after ordering.   I don't have any Vegas trips planned for the rest of the year, but l'll definitely go to this location again next time I'm there. It's so close to the airport and makes for the perfect stop to grab some food before heading back home!",

Let me tell you now.  It was a good burger.  Was it the best fast food burger?  No.  The fries were odd to me.  They seemed strangely flavorless and seemed hollow inside.  I basically got a deep-fried cardboard with salt.  Good news is they were hot since the place was PACKED.  I don't get this one.  Basically, I will compare it to Nickelback.  It's not terrible( at least not that you will admit) but it is strangely popular and you can't put your finger on why.    Cheap good eats for Vegas.  Super busy.

I got their pink lemonade to drink and liked it. The burger was good, but it's not different than any other fast foods. The fries needed to be cooked longer and could have used more salt on them.

I have never had one of the workers ask if we wanted \"special sauce\" on our burgers it has always been \"spread\". That wasn't a big deal to us we just thought it was funny.  My hubby ordered a \"4x4\" and I ordered my usual \"Grilled Cheese\". We always ask for it with grilled onions and for them to add mustard. Well, they repeated the order back to us True I&OB style.  We pulled away (napkins covering the food so couldn't see it just yet) and eagerly pulled into the parking lot across the street to get our grub on.  The fries were black, and I mean blaaaaack. They were mostly nubs instead of regular long fries.   I have been eating I&OB for decades and know they are the most consistent food chain out there. I had only one time ever had an issue at a location where the fries were black and I called their 800 # to complain and I have to say I never ever thought a fast food company would go so above and beyond to satisfy a customer. I was very very impressed.  Sure, I could call and complain about this visit but I'm not looking for freebies and I know for a fact I will be eating I&OB for many more decades to come as it is just too darn delicious. I instead just talked directly to the manger so he was aware as I know he knows that preparing the food a I&OB correctly is the standard they want to uphold.  He was very polite and apologetic. I *heart* I&OB!",

Surely enough, after arriving to Vegas from a delayed flight all the way from New York City, I went with friends to indulge in some In-N-Out.  I ordered the cheeseburger combo \"animal style\", which is one of the options they have on their secret menu. The sauce made my burger that much more juicy & enjoyable. The fries were very different in comparison to anything I had ate before, which makes sense since I had never enjoyed fresh fries from an establishment.   The location itself had tons of seating, either indoor or outdoor (by the gift shop). It was very clean for a fast-food joint.   What I couldn't believe were the prices at In-N-Out! My whole meal (burger, fries, & drink) came out to less than $6, which is very hard to believe.   I will definitely be going back to In-N-Out burger whenever I am in the west coast. I look forward to trying out more items from the secret menu, as well.",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally get the chance to taste what everyone had been raving about.. Looking at pictures on all my friends social medias the anticipation when I finally got to in and out was real!! This was the one place I was looking forward to most. So I asked an expect what to order they suggested I get the animal fries with a 3 by 3 just to make the experience an epic one while I'm visiting. Here's the verdict... So the fries were 1. Ice cold which I don't get I see them cranking them out right in front of you 2. tasteless.. Literally like cardboard covered in sauce I couldn't even take another bite.. Finally the burger it looks beautiful!! Again pick it up 1. Ice cold soggy and 2.tasteless just covered in sauce which I know I asked for so its not the sauce I'm complaining about. The bread was just mush and not soaked by the sauce just cold and wet! I took one bite and could not believe what just happened after waiting on the long line for my food and all the anticipation this just happened!!! I was completely heartbroken I had no desire at that point to even get up and have them remake my meal.. I was hungry and beyond aggravated. I don't know what happened I saw them cranking out fresh fries and burgers back there by the minute.. Why my food came out like that was mind blowing. Sorry to say I am not a fan. Guess it was just my luck :(",

It's not all because of the huge crowds, although that's part of it. The problem was that the service is shoddy, which should not be the case even at a busy location. On certain travel weekends, Kettleman City, located roughly halfway between the Bay Area and LA, gets pretty darn busy, but they can handle themselves. Here, they call orders prematurely and don't get all the fries ready. I also saw a woman with a serious enough complaint to get a coupon or something from the manager.  The food was good, as you would expect from In-N-Out. Juicy burgers, fresh ingredients, all that jazz. However, unless you're going for the first time novelty of eating at the location with the flashy sign, then pick another location.",

The only explanation I can think of for all the ecstatic reviews is somehow they hypnotize you as you walk in the door, and for some reason we were immune. Or maybe they put something in the drinks.

And I washed it all down with a strawberry shake. If you're gonna eat unhealthy, you might as well go all the way in my book. Afterward, I walked back to the strip (30 minutes) to walk off my fullness. Why not 5 stars? I prefer a medium to thick patty. In n Out looks like a skinny McDonald patty. I like a decent chunk of meat and see the juice spew out just a little. A burger is not a burger if its not at least bit greasy.   But I admit these are the best fries I ever had. Not greasy but crisp and no salt needed. You can actually see them make the fries fresh from the potato.   I asked for In n Out sauce packets, so I'm gonna experiment on my own burgers/sandwiches at home :)",

Oh my and animal style is the only way to go for some incredible seasonings and lots of condiments/toppings. I repeat, animal style is the only way you want your cheeseburger fixed! Have no fear your won't find lettuce here to take away from the savory goodness of the rich meat and cheese.  The fries tasted healthier because they were freshly cut with the skin still on them. Personally I like greasy soggy fries but if you need some excuse to think you're eating healthy then they would be the reason.   Drive through lady was nice as she tried to share this special recipe that they have their for the lemonade tea. Not really sure so you'll have to ask what she was talking about. I was too distracted by the aroma of the food.   Damn it, now I'll have to find another excuse to get to the West coast ASAP for one of the best burgers I've ever had.",

I have to admit I was very skeptical at first but when I saw the massive cue in the drive thru and inside, I thought to myself this place must be pretty good. I felt kind of ridiculous standing in line, wasting my time waiting for a burger, but the people watching was interesting. Random obese men with back and kidney tits breathing heavily and scratching and sniffing like junkies waiting for a fix. People openly drinking beer in public. Some had mullets. Others did not.   I finally got my order. A cheeseburger combo. It just looked like any old random fast food burger except it was wrapped a little nicer and the person who handed it to me had a smile. I opened it up to inspect what was inside and it had the florescent yellow processed cheese square, a slice of tomato, lettuce, some beige goo and a pathetic lumpy brown disc that resembled beef. Took one bite and decided to give the fries a chance. They were bland, but when salted or smothered in catsup, they tasted much better. Since it was so cheap, instead of polluting my body any further i decided to just trash the whole lot. I was paying for the experience not the food. This is a biased review because I didn't stumble in here drunk. I think that's where all the 5*'s came from.   On a side note these were the happiest fast food employees I've ever seen. They addressed everyone as \"Sir\" of \"Mam\" and even as I was dumping my full tray of food into the trash, the guy sweeping the floors gave me a thumbs up as I walked out the door. You just don't get that kind of love and tenderness at McDonalds. I still won't be back though.",

In fact, according to a recent food survey on the internet I read that it was voted the best burger joint in America. Thus my expectations were rather high when I stepped into this burger joint.  I have to admit the burger was good, marginally better than any that I've had at other fast food franchises. Perhaps it was a classic case of overly high expectations, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.  The burgers were cheap,$1.69 for a cheese burger, which along with their tasty fare is probably the reason for their success.  Nevertheless, I didn't think the food was worth the $30 cab ride from and to our hotel, but if I was driving around with car I wouldn't mind stopping by once in awhile.",

They were more than  happy to get us in and out with a tasty burger in hand.   What amazed me was the fact that I ordered my burger with cheese only.  At most burger joints this would have been like me throwing a huge wrench in their burger making machine.  At In-N-Out Burger even though they were busy they got my burger order right.   The burgers, fries and drinks were good.",

Its not on the Strip but worth the taxi ride.  The cost for three people at In-N-Out was $18, which makes up for the cost you would have paid at any Strip hotel restaurant.  I got the double burger - and it was GREAT.",

Let me tell you a little story about a wedding.  As a pre-wedding party, the soon to be newly appointed MR. and MRS. Thought it would be a good idea to order 100 burgers, quarter them and serve them as appitizers as part of a pre wedding party in a massive suite with a giant deck overlooking the strip.    When we (and I'm not the MR in the equation, jut a helpful friend)  went to the place the order, the guy at the counter was in shock.  He looked like he wanted to say.  \"Wait.. How many?  You know if you eat that many, there is a high possibility that you might die of a hard attack.\"  Dont worry my good man,  these burgers (some animal style and some not) will be disbursed among the good people that came to Las Vegas to watch us get wed.  So yeah,  Me, the MR and MRS ordered about 100 burgers.  But thats not the best part.  We arranged to pick up these burgers at 8pm that night.  So what do we do.  Order a burger right then and there, fully knowing that there would be plenty to go round later.   I love my friends.",

There were about 6 people in line when we got in and the line wrapped around the store by the time we got our food. There has to be some reason behind this, right? Time to find out..  I never discussed this place with anyone, but for some reason \"double double animal style\" was implanted in my head from somewhere.. o_0 so I ordered whatever it was, along with a side of fries.   The burger consisted of cheese, grilled onions, pickles, tartar sauce(? or some type of sauce), and two patties. Them patties are thin! Man, the pics on the menu are deceiving. They make the burger look so juicy, succulent, and filling! The fries I could've done without. They were bland and the texture reminded me of styrofoam, of which my sister confirmed.    All in all, the burger was alright.. nothing spectacular. Personally, I'd prefer Five Guys or Smashburger over this. Hmm, service was decent and efficient, so our orders weren't screwed up which is a plus (yay!).",

It's one of those good quality fast food that never ever loses its luster.   Double-double animal style, should be what's in your mind if it's your first time coming through those doors. Make sure you're ready for a bit of a wait, because the lines here almost never ever diminishes. Pick a parking spot, watch your ticket number, and if they call it,, prepare for destruction.  The burgers are very good, I heard even just the cheese burger without the animal style sauce is state of the art. Fries are good as well, and please make it animal style as well. Trust me, you want that to happen. Hence the term, Double-double animal style.   It's a given that at any west coast destination, upon exiting the airport, make a direct trip to the nearest In-N-Out shop. It's probably a time honored tradition,, as far as I'm concerned at least.  I love you In-N-Out! I'll see you again next time. That's for real.  Thank you for reading my review. Follow me on Instagram and snapchat: rodtorres3",

This location gets quite rowdy and packed but the servers are very efficient and work hard get the food out quickly. My go to order is a double double animal style with fries and if I have room a vanilla milkshake for dessert. The quality of food is always consistent and the burger come out great every time I have come here.",

As our Uber driver put it, In-N-Out is a Las Vegas destination in itself. Ordered the cheeseburger and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of crisp lettuce it came with. Overall, it was a satisfying burger without the greasy, weighed-down after feeling. I wasn't wowed by the animal fries but I'd definitely come back just for the burger. By far my cheapest meal in Vegas yet one of my favorites!",

Being from Hawaii, I look forward to In-N-Out Burger whenever I am on the mainland continental U.S.  They have yet to open an In-N-Out Burger in Hawaii!  The burgers, simple, but juicy and mouthwatering, will tickle your taste buds!  The French fries are always fried to perfection! I always order the Double-Double and animal fries whenever I am here! Don't forget to order the milkshake while you're at it too, they are to die for! :D  There's only so much I can describe a fast food chain burger, but I think juicy, delicious, mouthwatering will speak for itself! These are really, really good!  Parking: although most In-N-Out Burgers in Las Vegas have ample parking, they tend to always be full! And yes, that includes the line inside!  On a recent visit, I befriended a trucker from Boise, Idaho who had made a pit stop at In-N-Out Burger! He had told me he was on the road for hours and said he couldn't wait for this particular pitstop! I was a bit surprised, but he said there aren't any In-N-Out Burgers where he lives! And there aren't any on his usual truck routes! Wow, and I had thought In-N-Out was everywhere! I had also noticed a lot of the cars in the parking lot were out of state license plates ranging as far as the east coast, south, Midwest and the west coast! They come from all over just to experience these mouthwatering burgers, French fries and milkshakes!  On this visit while waiting for my order I conversed with people from Maryland, New York and Tennessee and they, too, look forward to In-N-Out Burger as they do not have locations in the south or east coast that they are aware of.  So the next time you are in Las Vegas, make a stop at one of the In-N-Out chains! You have to taste the experience!",

As a New Yorker, I'm familiar with many things hyped that come and go, so I'll have to find out myself if this place really justified its hype. I went to try this burger chain located at one of the busiest places in Las Vegas. I was expecting long wait times and cluttered mess, but once I stepped into the place, I experienced something totally opposite; orderly wait lines, garbage bins were not overflowed with garbage, clean tables and seats and that delicious smell of fresh fries and burgers in the air.  The burger joint was full of people and there was atleast 10 people affront of me waiting in line. However, I spent no more than 10 minutes to get my food after I placed my order. I took a quick look at how the burgers were neatly presented on the serving tray, even the ingredients were placed with care. Also, the burgers weren't as greasy and I expected which was good. As I took my first bite, I could taste the fresh ingredients of the burger, and it tasted like Five Guys but better and for a fraction of the price. The fries tasted like it needs more seasoning, but who comes to In-N-Out for the fries, right? In-N-Out hands down deliver the best value burger in my book and I'll look forward to visiting this place many more times in the future!",

For the price, In-N-Out is worth it; these three items cost around $5. However, I do prefer my fries to be a little crispier, but that's something very minor.

Very close to the strip. While their is an In and Out on the strip, at the Linq. This local is so much better. How's that you might ask? It's hot here in Vegas, and as much as I radiate the rays of the sunshine; I have to have air conditioning to eat my food. Their is no ac at the local at the Linq, and it's so crowded. Tourists snapping this photo around the fountain. Do yourself a favor and when you come here enjoy your In and Out at a table in the AC with individuals that share the same goal orientation as you; eating in peace.   It is not even a question to even Animal Style. On this trip to In and Out I was longing for those animal style fries. Although, I am not a fan of the animal style on my burger; either are the children. Did you just say you can animal style your burger too! Why of course my dear. You can animal style anything, even the protein burgers. Get over here and try it. Some may say, animal style it's just a glorified thousand mix with onion. These are haters and while the animal style might contain some thousand mixture, the secret ingredient cannot be duplicated. No other burger joint can replace or replicate \"animal style,\" in any way.   What's a burger without a decent shake to wash it down with. Chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla the shakes here are tremendously insane. You will not be disappointed truly. If you cannot decide on one flavor or not. Perhaps you want all three. Shall we get our shake on now. Yes, we are with no regrets what so ever. We are going for it today, maybe it's the Vegas style bet it all or nothing. Who knows? Let's do the Neapolitan Shake today. This shake is bliss, their secret menu here, so one has to ask for this by name or reference. If you forget what it's ever called, Google the secret menu and all will be revealed.  The staff here could not be more fantastic. It's always a pleasurable experience to come and be served by the staff here of In and Out. Smiles oh so large and if they could I think we would hug it out. The energy inside of In and Out reminds me of the days of my youth when we would hang out and play video games at the arcade and eat burgers. Guess where we gathered for burgers, you got it right; In and Out. It's amazing to share a wonderful experience every time I visit an In and Out since I have shared so many memories here. Every visit puts a smile on my face and brings me back again and again for decades.   Crazy drive thru lines always from morning to night at all times. Will you wait over thirty minutes in your ride for the best burgers on the West Coast. Yes they are that good. Come take the In and Out challenge. If you want the lines inside are long sometimes at times, that's with three cashiers working too. The efficiency of the staff on moving the amount of customers is sheer brilliance here. The joy from the crew as they all work their stations to ensure that all things happen correctly is like watching the inner workings of a machine. The product that one is given takes like love and happiness and feels like each burger was hugged as it was wrapped up. As that white bag is handed to you know that the individuals behind your burger share a wonderful joy in making sure your experience is superior. The company practices guaranteeing a living wage to their employees. In and Out has decided to help end world bondage where others are bought and sold by collecting money for the various charities they support. The money spent here goes back to us the customer, to the employees, and the fab food that one can be sure is sheer bliss every time with happiness just a wrap away.",

Their burgers are much better than shake shack - bigger and more toppings. The animal style fries are a must try, but split with someone if you're eating them with a full meal. The shakes are a refreshing choice if you're seeking shelter from the Vegas summer heat.  Didn't get a chance to visit the company store next door but might try to because I'd love some In-N-Out merch! Overall, a pleasant experience! I would go back.",

Someone is out restocking, picking up trash and wiping tables consistently  Cons: - definitely a tourist stop, a bit crowded and loud. It is what it is  Verdict: how can we not come back?

This place is a madhouse. People are always coming in n out (lol) and it's a skill in itself trying to find a seat. But once you dig into your burger, your hunger subsides and the frenzy that is going on around you seems to (slightly) disappear. The animal style burger was good, but I think for me, the animal style French fries stole the show. Their chocolate milkshake was good too. I live in Hawaii, so I'll only get to experience this place again during a future mainland trip.",

My order, \"Cheeseburger, Animal Style, no spread, mustard instead\" was great.  My wife orders her cheeseburger with grilled and raw onions, and it was also perfect.  The peppers were stocked well, and in case you've got no idea what I'm referring to, In-N-Out has, next to the ketchup dispenser, a small container of spicy wax peppers that are occasionally out of stock.  They were not on our recent visit, and so I was, as you'd imagine, very happy,  In-N-Out is always on the short list for great meals, served quickly...",

That seems like a lot but this location gets people in and out!! Literally the name!   When we pulled in I noticed they have a store to the left of the restaurant. Each location sells T-shirt's and a couple small items but this is a free standing merchandise store! It was closing when we left, so I didn't get to check it out.   The guy who took our order was super nice! He handed my boyfriend's son stickers as soon as we walked up, which I thought was so nice! I made a comment about how cute they were and he even offered me some. Overall, we had great service here and it was fast! The food was yummy, as always!",

So maybe they've hyped it up so much that it couldn't live up...or maybe it's just overrated.  The menu is simple and straightforward which I love. I hate being overwhelmed with food choices. I had a number 2 (I think)...single cheeseburger with fries.  The burger was decent--not bad in any way, but certainly nothing to write home about. The fries were NOT good! They were undercooked with no flavor. I hate to say it but Shake Shack and Give Guys make better burgers in my humble opinion. I'm half I tried it because now I have the context.

The burgers are terrific and fries are much better than other fast food restaurants.

But the inside is nice to eat in as well, and very clean!  So an app to order and pay would help us a lot because the drive thru is hard for my husband and I sometimes. The double double and all that...and my son always wants something from the secret menu...by the way, animal fries are NOT french fries cut in the shape of animals...we found that out the hard way when we ordered 3 animal fries...but anyways, in addition to the food, the servers are super sweet and nice!

Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries (my preference is still Dick's fries up in Seattle!) but I would certainly come here again when I'm in the area!",

My go to is always a Double Double Animal Style and Protein Style/Animal Style.  That way you still get the benefit of the bun, but when you want more and eat the protein style.. you won't be too full already.  If you get the fries animal style, ask for them well done.  Service is always amazing at every In N Out I've been to.  Everyone that works there takes pride in what they do and are genuinely nice.  Skip the drive thru and just ask your cab driver to wait outside for you while you run in to get food.  The line goes by fast and you get your food fairly quickly. Then off to the airport you go.",

The parking lot was packed with cars. Other taxis were taking folks here (and I might have seen a limo). The line was pretty long, snaking almost outside the door. Diners were eating outside as well as inside, but while waiting, we somehow managed to secure a few tables for our group. Service was going as fast as they could; there simply was an amazing mass of customers.  I ordered a 3x3 Animal Style. As usual, it was DELICIOUS (either you love In-N-Out or you don't, I fall in the former camp). One of my friends requested hot peppers and they came out in little baggies - that's the first time I've seen that at an In-N-Out, and it made my burger even better. If you like In-N-Out, this is one of the good ones, which makes everything just the way they usually do it. Recommended for a good, greasy fast food meal off the Strip, nothing more.",

Chances are you can make a better burger at home, but at the same time there is something that makes me try and make this my first stop whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  So the bottom line is, it's all about the In-N-Out love.  Good consistant quality that is extra delicious for an out of towner.",

Whenever I have the opportunity to eat at an In-N-Out I jump at it; regardless of whether or not I'd already eaten at one earlier in the week.    This location is right off of the strip and can be accessed via cab if you don't have a car.  Given its proximity to all the tourists (myself included) it's usually always busy no matter when you go.  Despite the constant crowds the staff here were genuinely friendly which only added to the awesome experience of chowing down on my Double Double and fries (both Animal style of course).  The milkshakes are also pretty good and deserve a worthy mention.",

    "text": "In-n-out has been on my wish list for many, many years but living on the east coast, I have never had the chance to try one out.  So my bachelor party was in Vegas and my one (main) request was that we eat here.  After a roughly 10 minute uber ride from the strip, my wish was granted.  The inside of the building is very plain with little to no decor.  The menu is very small, with maybe 3-5 total items.  This isn't a problem though, as it probably helps with how quickly they're able to process each order.   I had a Double Double, regular fries and a drink.  The burger was excellent.  Bun was soft and spongy and the meat was juicy, tender and flavorful just as I had been told.  This burger definitely lives up to the hype.  I am also a fan of Shake Shack and his was comparable to their offerings.   The fries were kind of blah.  Nothing special, thin-cut fries just dropped in a fryer and served.  I tried a couple of my friend's animal fries and they were a little better but still did not meet my expectations.   All in all, I would eat here if given the choice in the future.  But if I had to chose between In-n-out and Shake Shack, SS would definitely win.",

My cousin and i went there after we got the munchies after being in the pool all day. There was a line of people waiting but i did not care, i was determined to leave with a burger in my tummy. The sandwich was really good! it was very fresh. The fries i was not to crazy about, but i should have gotten \"animal style\". I loved it so much i am counting the days until my fiance and I go to California in June to eat at one of these restaurants. hmmmm hmmm goood!!!",

Mcdonalds milkshakes are far far superior.  The cost was pretty decent.  Five guys is more expensive but is a lot better. The burgers here are better than Mcdonalds but the fries - if you have them plain are crap and the milkshakes are vastly inferior. Mcdonalds does a better job on those items.",

The place was busy, even for a Thursday night at closing time. Speaking of closing time, keep an eye on the hours if you are out looking for late night grub, there were numerous people that came in and were refused service as it was time to close. It seemed a bit early in my mind but not everywhere in Vegas is 24hr. If you're reading this review and have never had In N Out, check out their secret menu if you haven't heard! The grilled cheese is perfect if you don't want a gut bomb right before bed.",

    "text": "Oh In-N-Out. Where do I begin?  The waits are long, almost 30 minutes sometimes. You do weird things like put bible verses on your packaging. Your sauce is ~mysterious~ And still, I always come back.  Five Guys and Smashburger both give you a run for your money. But to get a double-double with fries and a drink costs less money than a basic burger at those two places. Mind you, that's before the fries and the drink.  The milkshakes are Ixcacao-approved contraptions! The special sauce is probably the closest you'll ever see to me eating anything with a mayo-base. You season and blend it well enough with whatever else you use in it to take away that icky mayonnaise taste from it.  The long waits for your food show your dedication in making a quality product. The long lines show that it is indeed something worth waiting for. The fact that you, a California institution, sees Nevada as a worthy contender for expansion shows your generosity.   I practically grew up on you, In-N-Out. And for that, you'll always have my heart.   The Final Verdict  Pros: In-N-Out Quality. A local institution practically. Milkshakes to die for. A secret menu that goes on for days.  Retro decor.   Cons:  Not open 24 hours.  Might be run by religious nuts. Just saying.   Return Factor: 10/10. Well duh.",

I expected it to be similar to McDonalds, but it's nothing like Mickey D's at all. First of all, all they do is burgers. No chicken or fish sandwiches to get in the way. And, the burgers are made with real meat, imagine that! In addition to the burgers, they make french fries and have drinks....that's it! The fries are good too. Not greasy at all. I heard about long wait times, but I have to say, that at this location anyway, they moved the line very quickly. We only waited a total of 4 minutes from ordering the food to them calling our number to pick it up and considering the long line, I thought that was pretty fast. We were able to find a seat easily also. If I lived on the West Coast, I'd be in trouble with this place lol.",

We came during lunch and were order #14. By the time we ate our meal, they surpassed #14 once more and were on order #2. They were that busy. When you first enter the joint, it may look like you need to jump on the next available table while you're in line. But the turnover is fast. Tables become available readily.   You can ask for extra (packaged) spread if you're really into their sauce. And the chili peppers are self service. As a tip, expand the white paper container so you can hold more chili peppers. They are meant to be expanded if needed.  Make sure to visit the merchandise store across this joint. There are only 2 in the nation!",

I also heard they have a secret menu so I would definitely go back and give it another try.",

    "text": "This was the second time I've been to an In-N-Out restaurant and I was pleased with the burger.  I got a burger, protein style and an order of fries.  The burger was very juicy, and the sauce on the burger didn't overwhelm the flavor.  The fries were good.  Almost every review mentions how busy this location is and they are all correct.  We waited about 20 minutes to place and receive our order.  The parking lot was almost full near the restaurant although there's another lot north of the main one.  The interior was jammed with people.  A friend waited in line to place our order while I walked around trying to score a table.  It was almost like playing musical chairs and I finally sat at one two seater table before someone else.  SInce I don't generally buy burgers out (I like them cooked rare and most places don't do this) I have less experience with burger joints. This would have been a 4 star review but for the wait and the quickness with which we had to eat or burger to get to our show on time.",

I came here with coworkers on a conference and we got lunch.  I ordered the cheeseburger animal style and fries also animal style.    I tried the burger and was unimpressed.  The burger patty is so thin compared to the toppings and the bun.  Bread with a side of meat?  Yea, pretty much.  The grilled onions really added flavor to the burger though.    The fries were so heavy.  Thick cheese and sauce and onions.  Again, the onions made it better until the cheese congealed and was really goopy.  The service was fast and they were really nice.  This was also a lot cheaper than I thought.  Still, I'd gladly pay a premium to eat at Shake Shack NYC!",

Located right of the I-15, this location is probably the closest for anyone staying on the Strip.   There isn't much variety here so my order usually looks the same: double-double animals styles with a lemonade. Being so close to the Strip also means this place is always packed. After midnight you will see a flurry of taxi's clogging up the drive-thru and a line up to the door for dine-in. Thus this location usually takes a little longer than the other ones; something to keep in mind if you are on a time crunch.

You will be crossing some busy intersections but they all have crossing lights, sidewalks - so just be careful and you can save some money on Cab or Uber.   I got a single animal style cheeseburger, fries (of course also animal style also - cheese, grilled onions and their spread) and strawberry shake. The line when we arrived 11a-Noon'ish was initially short but got much longer while we were there but moves very quickly. The staff was very friendly and appeared very well organized. The food was so cheap, but the quality was still on point. The burger was fresh, juicy and flavorful, the fries were crispy and the strawberry shake was made with the \"fake\" syrup which is actually my favorite. My husband ate a double/double burger and was so impressed he had to go back and get another. We sat outside where they had some nice tables as inside was getting kind of loud, busy.

    "text": "For my 100th review of 2017, I'm reviewing In-N-Out.  I think it's fitting since I have In-N-Out at least once a week.  I was told by the staff that this is the busiest In-N-Out in the nation.  The staff really didn't need to tell me this.  It's obvious when you come here. The drive thru and lines inside are both always long.  There's people everywhere and I mean everywhere.  Getting a seat inside the restaurant is rare.  You will see a lot people eating outside, on the curb, in their cars, and even at the In-N-Out Company Store. This location is actually not the last In-N-Out before you head to California, but it is the closest to the start of the Las Vegas Strip and airport.  This is the reason why it's so packed.  Plus, a lot of people love In-N-Out. A lot of out-of-towners can't get enough of it. The staff at this In-N-Out is very prepared for the madness.  They're all well-trained and manage to handle the volume of people with efficiency.   I recently ate here just because it's been a long time.  Last week was actually the first time I ate here as a Yelper.  I went with the usual, which is two Flying Dutchman's with Spread.  My meal was as good as it was the previous week.  I've had their Double Double, 3x3, Animal Fries, and a Grilled Cheese at this location back in the day.  That was a while back, though.   This In-N-Out used to be the fun one to go to. I say \"used to be\" only because they no longer create the fun burgers.  The first 100 x 100 that I have seen was at this In-N-Out.  The first Monkey Style Burger that I have seen was also at this In-N-Out.  My understanding is that they will not make both these burgers anymore or they were never allowed to.  It doesn't matter if they don't make these burgers anymore.  In-N-Out has a fan for life.  I'll see you soon, In-N-Out.  2017 In-N-Out Review #8 / 2017 Yelp Review #100",

    "text": "This was my first In-N-Out Burger experience and I loved it. Their menu is simple and their prices are cheap. Their menu is so simplified that there's no small, medium, or large. It's just one size. There was a long line and the restaurant was almost packed. This was around 1pm on a Thursday.  We ordered a cheeseburger, fries, and a vanilla/chocolate mixed shake. The burgers are huge. I could barely fit it in my mouth. It comes with lettuce and tomato for only $2.45. It was delicious with their house sauce that they put on it, kind of like Thousand Island. They gave a generous portion of fries for $1.65. Their fries are crispy and not greasy at all. I seen them fry it in the fryer, but it's as if it was air fried. It's one of the best tasting fries out there. Their shakes are thick and creamy, not overly sweet for $2.20. The hubby and I were fighting over the fries and the shake the whole time we were in the rental car. We should have just gotten our own but I didn't know how good it was going to be. I thought that it was going to be your average fast food.  I saw people ordering fries topped with their house dressing, cheese, and grilled onions. I didn't see it on their menu. I asked around and come to find out that it's called Animal Fries. In-N-Out Burger has this secret menu where you get extra stuff on your food because their menu is so basic.  I wish they'd open a location in Hawaii. The prices would be more, I'm certain. I'd pay it though, because their food is really good.",

When our fries were cold and we asked for new ones, the staff was very receptive and apologetic and served us hot fries right away. The food was good In-N-Out style! Plus, in spite of the crazy crowds, the floors and tables were impressively clean. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular here!",

It is a house full of happy people. From the 30 minutes I spent there I couldn't help but to notice the environment the people working there have. When we had order taken they were calling order #32 out order number was 59.  We had our order ready less than 20 minutes , the crew had the biggest grin on their faces the entire time and got 27 order ready in 20 minutes . I thought that was really impressive! \"Orlando\" acts like he owns the place. Sooo impressed and happy I stopped by and saw this operation , it motivated me to bring in and out to KC !",

It's not really this place's fault that I gave it 3-stars, but I am doing so in comparison to its sister locations in Las Vegas. The service is ok here, but it's just way overcrowded because this is the location closest to the Strip. Cabs and Uber cars are constantly stopping in the middle of the lot to drop off and pick up passengers, and the wait for food is long... extremely long for a 'fast food' joint. We waited 20-25 minutes for 3 cheeseburgers, one order of fries and one shake. Not sure how clean the place can get even with the staff trying to stay on top if given its popularity. Lesson learned.",

Just one bite and you can taste how wonderfully fresh and flavorful it is. The menu is simple and easy to understand. Their not so secret menu is to ask to make it \"Animal Style\" which includes extra thousand island spread, mustard grilled patty, and extra pickles.  For a singe patty, add some fries, and a soft drink, set me less than $5 for a truly good meal. The cashiers were always smiling and energetic. The place was clean and seemed packed even on a Monday afternoon. Recommended for all walks of life.",

But In n Out burgers have their own special taste to it. The best thing to order would be animal style. The burger was juicy and the fries were also good. The fries hardly have any salt on it at all, which I love. Makes me feel a tad bit healthier eating them...  There are other types of burger styles too such as a double or veggie style. Overall awesome place to stop by and grab burger and fries.  Def the best bang for your buck in Vegas. After an all day and night drinking orgy, go treat yourself correct at In-N-Out!!",

This In-N-Out, located directly across I-15 from New York New York on Tropicana, is just like most other In-N-Outs. The food is extremely fresh (considering it's fast food), the staff are friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is that of happy Vegas trippers who haven't had In-N-Out in a while (or ever!).  It's definitely a doable walk from the strip (specifically from Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd), but we did it in a car. Hey, you could probably do with a walk back after devouring a double-double!   Don't miss the little building to the left of the location. It's an In-N-Out merchandise store! Who knew! They have TONS of branded product. Anything from flip flops to coffee mugs! A little on the pricey side, but hey this is Vegas...",

I also made the walk from the Strip, except it took us 40 minutes because we didn't realize that the pedestrian sidewalk is only on the south side of Flamingo Road so we had to circle back. It was worth EVERY second.  I'm not a big fan of cheese on my burgers (besides, there's enough on the animal style fries!), so I got a double meat, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they actually charged me less than a double-double would have been. So they actually do subtract out the cost of the cheese. Score!  We came here around 9:15 pm on a Monday night.. and it was PACKED. So plan accordingly.  Just thinking about that meal is making me hungry all over again, so I'll stop. Basically, In-N-Out is STILL the best fast food burger I've ever had, hands down.",

My poor husband's blood sugar was dropping and needed food fast (me too I mean your girl loves to eat). Well it was fast. We even found a spot right outside to sit and savor our fare. I'd take InandOut over McD's anytime. I think we have a tradition now. Get off plane, get car, go to In and Out burger.",

Then he went ahead and personally made sure every single item was correct and in the boxes/bags. It was all ready in under 10 minutes including 12 burgers,12 shakes, 10 fries, etc.  The food was absolutely superb. This was only my 2nd time at an In N Out being from the East Coast, and I finally learned about animal style, and it was amazing.   The only downside is that it requires a RUN across an offramp to walk here. The sidewalk just freaking ends on Tropicana for about 300 yards. Lame. We had to go back and get our car.  Oh and to feed 12 or so of us was $70. Amazing.",

In and Out fries are not that great, but the burgers make it totally worth it(and you better like burgers because you can't get anything else there aside from pop and or a fantastic shake!)...unlike McD's and the rest of the places, they are literally using fresh beef to make the burger, the buns are fresh and buttered and they come with FRESH sliced tomato, onion and lettuce and a special sauce that is to die for...they use real cheese for the cheese fries too!

Before your mind wanders any further away from these burgers--with buns so delicious you can kiss them as you caress, sauce oozing out, and lots of meat to excite you into returning for more.

    "text": "In-N-Out Burger: Delusions of Grandeur.  If I was given the option to live off of one food for the rest of my life, it would probably be a cheeseburger. It's the one and only food I feel justified reviewing. So let me tell you this: If Shake Shack and McDonalds had a baby, it would be named In-N-Out.  There's a lot of hype surrounding this place, but not quite enough taste to back it up. Don't get me wrong, it's good...REALLY good for the price...but it's not in the same conversation as Shake Shack or Five Guys. It's just too \"fast foody\", if you will.   If you're visiting the West Coast: GET IT. Get the double-double with Animal Style fries. But don't set your expectations too high, as you will probably be disappointed.    P.S. The best burger I had in Vegas was one from Wolfgang Puck's bar and grill at the MGM Grand...if you're nearby for lunch or dinner and you're a burger aficionado, it's a must have.",

The burgers taste fresh, well seasoned, and more importantly not too greasy. Now all I can say is their french fries need to go, they are flavorless, boring and even ketchup can't help improve the taste. I think if they'd change it, I'd give them 5 stars, till then my 4 star rating will stand  This is one place I look forward to when visiting Vegas, especially if I'm craving a burger.  I'll miss you In-N-Out Burger, but we'll be back.  Till next time, happy eating!",

We had no idea what to expect but boy were we pleasantly surprised! The prices were cheap and the burgers and shakes were great! It's location is off the strip so we hailed a cab but it wasn't too far off. Getting a seat is a bit difficult because of how busy they are so I'd recommend bringing some friends to keep their eyes peeled for tables that might open. Because as quickly as a seat is emptied, it is filled and so it's a bit of a challenge if you're wanting to sit in. Other than that, a must try for those who love a good burger without the hefty price tags while in Vegas!",

I was never a fan of their fries.  To fresh and health for me.  The cheese on it sucked too.  Tasted like it was melted down rubber.  The burger was good though.  One burger was good enough for me but one of the guys ordered an extra one that nobody wanted to eat.  So I offered to help him eat it by eating half.  Oh man, I was so stuffed.",

You're literally crossing a highway, and only one side of the street has sidewalk. And it's not the side that has the In-N-Out Burger.

    "text": "First, In-N-Out is one of those things people obsess over when it's not local to them. I've been to Las Vegas a few times and had it in the past. I don't recall it leaving an impression. I'd prefer to give a 2.5 stars rating.      I got in late tonite and decided, let's give it a go again. I got an order to go of 3, double-doubles with pickles and onions, an order of fries, and a chocolate milkshake.      The order was ready pretty quickly (I went through the drive thru). It looked and smelled pretty good, but I was starving. My hotel is only 4 minutes away, so that was nice.      I unpacked my order and it all looked tasty. Appeared very fresh. The fries were somehow a bit cold already, possibly stale. I felt like it had some black flecks on them, like when the fryer oil needs a change. They were \"eh\". Base off of this particular order, I wouldn't get their fries again, but I know it might occasionally happen.      The burgers were quite large. Almost to the point of overstuffed, but because of the lettuce and tomatoes. The beef patties were cooked well and had a good taste. A bit of the problem with the over stuffing is the animal sauce made it VERY messy. The ratio of patty to everything else is a bit off. Eating the burger, a lot of it slides all over and you end up with kind of a wet handful of bun, sauce, lettuce, and tomatoes.      Overall, I think I may have had enough In-N-Out Burger. I probably wouldn't go back again.",

I get why people like these burgers, to quote Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction: \"That is a tasty burger!\"  Well aware even after only one other In-N-Out experience, I went in with the secret menu in mind.  I ordered a double-double, animal style; an order of well done animal style fries, and a fountain drink.  When my order first came out, I had just plain fries.  The order was sent back and when it all came back out, the animal-style fries were correct, but the fries were not \"well done\".  Annoyed, but instead of sending it back again, I took the order as-is.  It cost me $11 and some change, a little more expensive than most locations, but we are also talking Vegas.   Fresh ingredients, fast food, and all-in-all a food eating decision made worse with the feelings of gluttony after consuming so much fatty goodness.    I wish I could do an eat off with a hot Five Guys and a Hot In-N-Out at the same time, but I wash unable to do so with this visit.",

    "text": "I did manage to come back to this In-n-Out Burger a few weeks later when in Vegas for a work conference.  The food was just as good as usual, so nothing new to report there.    Some information for those who may be staying in a hotel on the Strip without a car, as I was this time, and are wondering about walking to In-n-Out, as I did. It is doable as long as you take the right approach.    If you are coming from Las Vegas Boulevard (the Strip) and want to walk down Tropicana Avenue over top of the I-5 freeway, you must stay on the south side of Tropicana Avenue. That is the side with the Excalibar Hotel as opposed to the north side with the New York New York Hotel (and Casino, but that is superfluous in any Vegas hotel name).  When you get to the street across from In-n-Out, you cannot cross Tropicana immediately but must cross Dean Martin Boulevard, then Tropicana, then Dean Martin again.  The direct route has no crossing signal.  Why did you have to stay on the south side of Tropicana when In-N-Out is on the north side?  You will come to a spot without sidewalks, and in that traffic you do not wish to take your life into your hands.  The good news about the walk?  The food is worth the trip,and you can feel virtuous enough from exercising - hey, you burn calories in the 100 degree heat - that you can add a milkshake without guilt.",

    "text": "I mean, this place knows the science of burgery.  The many times I've been to Vegas, I've always missed the opportunity to try this place out.    Finally had a few hours to kill before my flight left and decided to make a pit stop here with a buddy of mine.  He was broke from the Vegas shenanigans so I offered to front the bill.  Between him and I, we had to double doubles (made mine animal or something), two sodas, and split an order of fries.  This only cost about $15, not a bad deal.  Not an extensive menu to choose from and after asking the guy at the counter, it was pretty straight forward to figure out.  Basically, how hungry are you?  Explained a little further down, I should have opted in for the choice below the double double, but I have no regrets.  The wait wasn't excruciating, granted we stepped in and ordered before a herd of about 20 people rolled in, but it was about a 5 minute wait to get the order.  Fries were meh...tasted like 10 minute old McDonalds fries, which is still good but meh.  THE BURGERS, MY GOD!  I don't know their trick but the patty was kinda crunchy on the very edges and just the right amount of greasy.  I can compare the taste to Elevation Burgers free range burgers, if anyone is familiar with them, they are in my top choice of burger joints.  My buddy had no trouble polishing off his double double but, sadly, i was a bite and a half from being able to finish before my stomach finally told me that my eyes were bigger than it was.  This is going to be the new tradition of being the first or last stop in my Vegas trips.  I can't believe it took me 6 trips to Vegas to even try it out.  My dumb self should have listened to my other friends the first time I visited and made the time for this piece of Valhalla.",

    "text": "In town for some birthday celebrations for a friend, I immediately knew that we'd have to hit up an In-N-Out. Being the food nerd that I am, had heard of this west coast/southwest regional staple years ago, and I even have a book on its history.   We came in the mid-afternoon but there was still an impressive line up of at least 15 people, plus others waiting for their orders. What I saw in the store added up with what I had previously heard - a clean store, tiny menu with rock bottom cheap prices (especially compared to fast food in Canada), and a general old school kind of feel. There's no corporate attempts at modernizing, just the same thing that has made In-N-Out what it is today.   Naturally, I'd heard of their not so secret menu by this point and came armed knowing what I wanted. The line chugged along and orders were coming out of the kitchen at a blistering pace. When it came my time to order, I went with a double double animal style, well done fries and a strawberry shake. I'd like to think I sounded like I knew what I was talking about.   We patiently waited for a little while and beheld the spectacle of the well-oiled machine of this In-N-Out's kitchen. A few dozen orders later, I had my deep, red tray in hand and hunkered down to eat.  The fries were noticeably darker than my friend's, but not over done, just an eye-pleasing golden brown. They took on an interesting texture being cooked such that they weren't very fluffy inside, just crisp nearly all the way through. It wasn't a fry epiphany for me, but I definitely preferred them over the regular fries.  The burger itself was a sight to behold - the sauteed onions, extra sauce and pickles nearly pouring out of the container. It was a great flavour overall, even if it did somewhat overshadow the beef itself. What bites of unadulterated beef I could get, they were good - beefy, and moist and a little bit of zing from the mustard it was cooked in. The only downside and a very nit-picky one was that the thick slice of beefsteak tomato was distractingly thick and cooled down the burger. All in all, it was a wonderful, hot mess of a burger.  The shake was a fine execution of the classic dessert drink - thick, but not impossible to suck up the straw and the pleasant familiarity of the strawberry flavour.  With my visit later in the day to a Michelin-starred restaurant, I was able to tick off two big items on my foodie \"to do\" list. In-N-Out definitely lived up to the hype for me, and I look forward to when I'm next in a city that has one.",

    "text": "What can be said about In and Out Burger?!! Its awesome and I wish they had them in Florida! This was the first place we went after landing and waiting what seemed like forever for our rental car. It is very crowded and it can be tough to find a table. Every table was full inside, so as my husband waited in line I stalked the tables. I finally got one, it was very dirty, which I had to clean myself but like I said its busy.   The service is great, they really work like a machine, everyone knows their job and knows what to do and does it efficiently and quick. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food after ordering.   The burger was hot and delicious. They have this \"special\" sauce, I don't know what it is, but it was amazing! I don't like it on my burger, but I asked for it on the side, which they had no issues. It is great on fries. The fries were thin, perfect for me. They were hot and crispy. They didn't seem to have any salt on them, but I think that's good since some people need to watch the salt.   The prices are not bad at all. It was less than 20 for two burgers, two fries, a shake and large drink. I think its the west coast's version of McDonalds and boy it is a thousand times better! We will go every single time we are on that side of the US.",

    "text": "Finally had this for the first time.   I was surprised at how cheap it was! These burgers are seriously a great deal. It comes with onions, lettuce, cheese, tomato, the usual - and they have their special thousand island-tasting sauce. The fries are pretty good too, especially when dipped wit the burger sauce. It's not the best burger out there, (there are many others I would recommend in my own city), but I still like it.   Not sure how I feel about the service, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The manager came to our table to randomly talk to us, and he came back about another 2-3 times to talk and ask questions while we were eating, and gave us some hats. I thought he was just bored or really liked us because he we were from out of town, I don't know - but when we finished our food he asked us if we had a working phone, and to call a certain number so that we could put in a good word for him. I forget his name now, but he was very demanding about it. Now we know why he talked to us for so long... and he said we HAD to call that number while we were still in the restaurant. When we said we would do it later he still insisted that we do it right then and there which made us feel a little uncomfortable... tsk tsk.  Anyway, I would definitely come here again for those burgers.  Hmmm debated between 3 or 4 stars for a while now, but I will do 4 for the good bang for your buck.",

In-N-Out has to be my favorite and i've tried Shake Shack in NYC, other burger places in Cali and many other in between and I seem to come back to In-N-Out!  My typical order would be #3 with NO onions. It is just a classic hamburger with fries and a drink on the side. You can substitute your pop for a milkshake of your choice! Might I add that the milkshake is SOOO creamy and SUPER delicious! Some days i'll substitute my usual iced-tea for a vanilla shake. and all for about $10!  What is fun about this place is that they have a secret menu. You can search online and see what they have to surprise you with! I usually just stick with the classic. I do however like the animal style fries. It is their secret sauce on top of regular french fries!   If you have not experienced In-N-Out yet, you should check it out and see for yourself! It is definitely one of my guilty pleasures!",

I ordered yes, from the NOT SO SECRET MENU.  Double Double Animal Style and Fries I want animal style too.  I loved every bite, I ate at alot of different places, but to me that night It was the equivalent of fine dining.  I had so much fun eating this, the fries tasted so good I could not believe it.  In a way I wish it would come to NY and east coast in general but also I look at this as something only some people should indulge in, haha.  It makes you look forward to your next trip to Arizona, Las Vegas, or California or anywhere else they have this.  Very affordable as well.  I think it was $7.05 for the combo and that is with the adjustments for the fixings.  My cousin went really buck wild and got the FOUR BY FOUR, so I got to witness him eating the four patties of beef right there on the bun and he actually tore through that burger.  Finished before I finished my fries or burger.  Kinda wish I had time to go back again to this location which is known as the most popular in Vegas (the wait time was actually not that long, maybe 20 mins at 8:15 at night on a monday) but nope ran out of time.  Was a total fat ass and had to take a cab back to civilization after walking the almost mile to get here then eating all that food, a walk back did not look pleasant, so a cab back to Tropicana for some walking around was in order.",

I 've heard about this place from several others that live on the west coast and HAD to try it. It was by far the most AMAZING burger I have ever had (and I have tried many GREAT burger places). It was the best meal (and cheapest) that I came across in VEGAS and I even ate at Bobby Flay's. Burger tasted fresh, the cheese was THICK and tasty...Lettuce was so CRISP like they just picked it. It was just ONE of a KIND! Added bonus that the people are EXTRA friendly and if you like cheese fries.....they take a thick slice of cheddar cheese place it on top and put it in this melter for a min....YUM. I'd drive from CHicago to get one RIGHT now!!!!! SO if youre in VEGAS its only a 5 dollar cab ride from MGM hotel. WELL worth it. Even with the cost of a cab ride it was the cheapest meal and BEST meal I had in Vegas.",

I dunno, and I don't think I want to find out.  It's like the first time I had a chicken Big Fat Taco from Del Taco - HOLY SHIRTS AND PANTS I thought it was SOOO good! Screw Taco Bell! Screw Taco Bueno! Granted I was hung over, so that might have factored in somehow as well.  So I went on a Saturday afternoon and like previous people have mentioned, the place was jam packed with a line out the door. The line moved quickly, however there wasn't enough seating so we had to hover over people who looked like they were almost done with their food and our group of 8 had to split up. I almost started getting annoyed and questioned why we wasted a cab ride here until our food arrived. *angels chorus from up above* I don't know what it is about these damn burgers that make them so tasty. I think they sprinkle crack or MSG in the patties. Fixin's were all fresh. Fries were ordered animal style. Delicious, crisp, fresh fries (they don't even have time to get cold, do you see this line out the door?) It was the best meal I ate in Vegas.",

We ate here because every place else inside the casinos was either closed or imposed a 1-2 wait time. By 11:30 p.m. I could have chomped on my own two feet for all I cared - I was starving! Plus after running 26.2 miles, they (my feet) were as good as useless anyway.  Luckily I did not have to consume any appendages; and it was a relief to see that the line inside In-N-Out was only semi-ridiculously long compared to the restaurants along the Strip. I couldn't have been more satisfied with my hamburger, fries, and chocolate shake. My fiance was very happy with his Double-Double, cheeseburger, and Animal Fries.  Thanks, In-N-Out for helping us end our race on a positive note!",

I grew up on Whataburger in Texas, and to me that is the standard for good fast food burgers.  I do not get putting 1000 Island dressing on a burger?!  And I've seen some even put it on their fries there.  Disgusting.   And despite the fact I tell them no onions, I still taste onions on mine, every time.  It's like they take the onions off or they use the same knife to cut other veggies that they use to cut the onions, or they mix minced onions in the hamburger meat.  And I know they fries are fresh cut, but I'm not a fan of those either.  Now, I will say this for them, they have GREAT service and they are always super friendly and that's hard for as busy as they are.  I go in there for milk shakes from time to time now.  But I will trade every one of these In-N-Outs in Vegas for one Whataburger!",

Almost every visitor to Las Vegas must have this location on their \"to do list\"-I do see lots of tourists taking pictures and raving about it as they sit and devour their burgers.  Being a local I eat @IN_N_OUT_Burger pretty regularly so I like to change it up and do something different every now and again.  I ordered a 4x4 w/pickles & onion ONLY plus a regular with everything. 2 orders of fries.  Only the 4x4 was mine but it was a real challenge to eat it all-BUT  I was determined not to wuss out in front of my son.  It's only $1 to add an extra patty w/cheese so dare to be different and next time go crazy and try a 10x10 !!    ps. The COOLEST thing about this location is the GIFT SHOP outback. You can get all those cool In-N-Out souvenirs you've been checking out in the brochures.",

And me, being a New Yorker, never had the pleasure of savoring one of these freshly made burgers... until a recent work trip to Vegas!   Fo'reals, didn't know one existed in Vegas (if I had known, I would've been there every day vs just a few hours before my flight out!).   Thanks Leah R. for the tip on the walk from Excalibur - it was literally only 15 minutes! And the walk made me work up my appetite. Good times! Leah R.'s directions: \"Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip. Just walk down the sidewalk on the Excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there. It's like a 15 minute walk.\"   Had my double-double animal style with a vanilla milkshake to wash it all down. Seriously, I have to say... it really was the best burger I've ever had. The melding of flavors was seriously awesome. And if I wasn't with a group of people... I could've thrown down another double-double, but didn't want to look too much like a pig!   Seriously - go. And my $6 dinner was the cheapest meal I had during my entire trip in Vegas!",

It is always refreshing to bite into a burger and have your taste buds thank you.  You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well.   With that limited menu, you truly know what to expect when you go there. Outside them asking you if you want onions on your burger, grilled or non grilled, there aren't too many surprises with this place.  I did not try the lemonade to see if it was special.    3.5 star experience rounded to 4 stars.",

I love their \"special\" sauce and always ask for packets to take home, don't forget that request as it is yummy on the fries!  Great burgers and shakes however as I have said for years I just wish they had a different kind of French fries as those dried up  slivers of potatoes they call fries just don't cut it with me.  The only way I will order their fries is animal style.  We have loved there food for years since I had my first experience in San Diego, California back in the early 90's!  No need to make a long review, good food, service, quality, prices, and clean it is what it is.  Peace out!",

They rarely make a mistake in the drive-thru window as well, which is amazing considering the volume of customers.  I always get #2 (cheeseburger with fries and a drink) but make the fries animal style. With banana peppers. Ace!! Such a west coast classic.  Good luck finding seating during peak hours though!",

I had a mouthwatering regular Hamburger, Animal Style (pickles, extra spread, grilled onions, mustard fried onto meat patty).  You definitely have to order something off the \"secret menu\", like \"Animal Style\", if you ever dine here.  Thanks for the tip, Yelpers!  The line was out the door when I arrived on a Sat. afternoon.  Makes sense, since it's the only In-N-Out Burger near the touristy Strip.  It moved as quickly as possible though, and everything was managed smoothly.  The drive-thru line was much shorter.  Clean BRs, btw.  I walked here, but don't do it by yourself, since it's kind of in a sketchy area.  If you walk here anyway, then at least do it during the daytime from the north side, along Vdara, Aria, etc., as opposed to the south side by Luxor.",

    "text": "Ok, as a guy from the DC Metro area, I'm constantly told by friends who have been out west that In-N-Out is the best burger chain and a must-have should I find myself out here.  I had eaten a burger here in NorCal a few years ago and was unimpressed, but my palate wasn't as refined so I figured I'd give it another shot.  My dad, brother and I went at lunch time on a Friday. The line was long but orders were taken quickly and food was coming out constantly. It was truly impressive!  Now as for what I ordered: a #1 Double Double with everything (including onion), fries and a Coke. I picked up some of the \"Chiles\" too.  So the Chiles are just baby pepperoncini I guess, but they were tasty. The fries were weak. I know they're fresh but they're dry and crunchy, like canned Potato Sticks you can get in the store. The burger was tasty, and while I hate Big Mac sauce and thousand island dressing, I actually did like the In-N-Out sauce. I'd put the burger a notch above Wendy's but that's it. My brother got a vanilla shake and it tasted like someone blended up McDonald's ice cream cones, including the actual cake cone. Meh. It's also taken a few hours to dissolve the salt left in my throat from the food.  Five Guys destroys In-N-Out in every regard. The selection of toppings at Five Guys is astounding and their boardwalk style fries have NO EQUAL. Now, In-N-Out is good, and I'd give it a 3.5 if I could for the food. The 4 is earned by effort of the staff and execution. Not having bacon or other exotic toppings is a serious hash in the con box.",

I also got the animal fries and I think it's one of those things you either love or hate.

We asked for another grilled cheese instead of that. Animal fries were okay but again, not as delicious as I remember. Not sure if it was just this location, or if my tastes have changed. Before we went here, I was planning to have in-n-out twice on this trip but after this experience, we didn't go back during our time there.",

The closest thing i can compare the taste of the food to is i guess 5 Guys Burgers, but it is way better than that.  The secret menu is really no secret anymore as during my last couple of visits the cashier reeled off several items from it.  The service each and every time i have been to this place is exceptional.  The employees are very patient and very helpful.  A trait that you will only see in fine dining settings in NY and NJ.  The place is always clean even though every single time i have been in here it has a line of at least 20 people long.

Let me start by saying that people come from around the world to Las Vegas and THIS is most divination a \"destination location\"   I have been to so many In N Outs and never seen one as dirty as this one. From the bathrooms to the tables and floors, down right dirty. In fact, if I didn't know how amazing the meal was going to be I would have looked at this as another McDonald's. Which is an insult.  In N Out is supposed to be a family owned and operated company that cares about the quality of their food and the foundation of which is was born. And yes, you are just fast food. But you're more than that. Which is why my expectations are so high. If the owner walked through this location at this time someone was for sure getting fired.   Step your game up people.

Our order was taken immediately and we waited about 7 minutes or so for over 9 cars who were in front of us! If that's not considered fast service idk what is!! The burgers and fries were delicious and when we asked for a nutrition facts sheet we were promptly handed one.   The food is a wonderful price, we ordered 5 burgers and 5 fries with 3 drinks and the total was somewhere around $24. It doesn't get better than that!   Of course, no complaints about In N Out. Not now...not ever. 10/10 would come back and recommend.",

We ended up going to sonic.   I love the concept, super simple - double cheese, cheese, or a hamburger. The choice is yours, we chose to eat the cheese and double.   Service: they had the system down and were still very friendly. May have to be louder when calling out numbers as it was loud from patrons.   Seating: it's a rat race to get a table, we usually get lucky and this time no different, scored a lovely booth -whom I offered to a lovely couple searching for a place to sit prior to our departure.   Prices: $23 for 3 cheeseburger combos and one double cheeseburger combo. Love it!!  Food: we love, love, love the French fries!!! When going to places, like McDonald's, we have to order our fries with no salt. But here they don't add it but give it to you separate The burgers have lettuce, tomato, and onions (at no charge- lol!!) free refills too.   Overall- worth it, quality and price: )",

The sauce is great though.I also had the fries, which were good but I also tried a friend's animal style fries and those were amazing!

The fries really aren't good at all.  They taste a bit like the really crappy old Wendy's fries.  I realize that you can customize it all you want with their \"secret menu\" .. but frankly their main menu should show off their best product.

I've passed it many times, but the line is always super long so I go to the one on Maryland Pkwy by UNLV. But, since it was a little late at night, I decided to withstand the long drive thru line. Its so busy that an employee is taking orders on foot 20 cars deep from the front. Its cool I dont mind. It was worth the wait once I get those fries in my mouth for the drive home. Always got to eat the fries as you drive!  Quality is 5 Stars and the price is best value for your money. And, the employees are 'cut from a special mold'. Seems at every IN N OUT I have been to, the employees are super exceptional and trained in courteous customer service. Always friendly too.  Favorite fast-food burger of all time!

This location is close to the strip and a nice establishment.  I came around 2pm on a Thursday and there was a long line for the drive-thru (maybe 20 cars), but only a few people on line inside.  I got my food in about 10 minutes and ate it on the way back to the Casino. They make everything fresh to order and it definitely shows. Meat was fresh and perfectly charred as always.  The buns are like little pillows and the amount of cheese is perfect to cover everything.  I really like the sauce, but am kind of over the animal style.  I prefer to taste the meat - it is so good!

For the most part their burgers and fries taste very bland without adding a lot of salt, ketchup, and that simple Thousand Island sauce they use on the burgers.   The beef is a very thin patty that is not all that juicy. The fries are dry and many times overcooked. The shakes taste artificial and from out of a machine.   The cooks pour way too much salt on the burgers and fries, drowning the burgers and fries in salt.  I see nothing special about In and Out at all.   Now...when you compare it to Shake Shack burgers, fries, and shakes, Shake Shack comes out way ahead in taste, service, quality overall...way better than In and Out.",

The only thing is the cheese fries have two slices of cheese melted in top instead of a liquid cheese. You should eat them fast or it'll start to cool down and be a little harder to eat, but still delicious. the 4x4 is awesome and will definitely test the limits of your jaw opening. The shake is a pretty standard shake. Everything is priced reasonably too.",

The seating area was very crowded and the kitchen staff were  very busy - nevertheless, the kitchen and store were very clean (typical of this brand.)  Our burger and fries came reasonably fast and were up to their usual standards.  They also had workers roaming to pick up trays of people who had finished eating (perhaps a gentle reminder that people were waiting to be find a seat.

Pro tip: when you pull in head straight to see the line for drive-thru. It's not a counter clockwise rotation like most other spots. Also, there is plenty of parking (they own the building and lot next door too) so if you can't stand the wait, head on in. There will probably still be peeps in there, but at least you can fill up some ketchup cups while you wait. If you still choose to eat in your car, they give you placemats for your lap, so no worries about getting some animal sauce leakage on the pants. Speaking of animal sauce leakage, get this on everything. Fries and burger alike. Then again, you know the hype, you see the reviews, do you! A solid fast food burger awaits you any which way you order. Enjoy!",

The burger was decent, but the fries were really disappointing. My fries were soggy and hard to eat--I ate barely half of them.

Can't wait to get back out to the West Coast to get some more of this greatness that actually does live up to the hype. Next time - definitely animal style on the fries, and a shake.",

    "text": "This is my favourite burger place in the USA. I'm on a diet right now so I was unable to try the double double burger. So instead I just got a regular hamburger fries and a lemonade. I managed to stay within my diet and enjoy the most delicious burger I've ever had. This location, like every other one I've been to, is incredibly busy. However, because of the limited, simple menu, they are very fast and efficient. I still had to wait about 10 minutes but there was probably 30 people ahead of me. Not bad! One thing that really impressed me about this place is how hygienic everything is. The staff is always running around cleaning things and if anything hits the floor, straight to the garbage! The atmosphere reminds me of a 1950s diner. If you've never been here before, give yourself a treat and try it.",

    "text": "The Gold Standard of fast food burger chains. You really can't beat the value (quality for price) you get from going to In-N-Out Burger, especially when compared to other Vegas eateries. Make sure to study up on the \"Secret Menu\" to prevent yourself from saying, \"That's it?\", when looking at the menu for the first time. If you only remember two words, let them be \"Animal Style\".  Good: Price and Quality. Where else in Vegas near the Strip can you get a good quality double burger, fries, and shake for around $7? The workers took their time and showed enthusiasm, which is always a bonus for fast food. Location is close to Strip. If you don't have a car you can still walk there. While it's on the North of West Tropicana Ave. past I-15, take the sidewalk on the South of W. Tropicana Ave. (Excalibur side, not NYNY side) and head West. There is a walkway that loops around the overpass and you can make it there safely via sidewalks/crosswalks. Don't forget about the store on the North side of the restaurant. Very reasonable prices for merchandise.  Cons: It can be busy. Don't try and go during peak times if you are in a hurry. Once you become a regular, newbies will start to annoy you.",

I was hoping that MAYBE I had remembered the food being better than it was, and that really, the burger places around here were actually yummier.    Nope.  Double doubles are all that and then some.  The fries are heaven.  I probably shouldn't have eaten here because now I won't be satisfied with the burgers I get here in Texas.  Tip: you CAN walk here from the strip.  Just walk down the sidewalk on the excalibur side of the street across the freeway bridge entrance area and under another little bridge and you're there.  It's like a 15 minute walk.  We took a cab there because we didn't know where it was, but we totally felt silly about it when we got there and then walked back.",

The burger is great, but the fries are below average (without animal style). The first few bites makes me feel like I'm in heaven, but it gets old pretty quick. Maybe it's just too much sauce. I don't know.  The concept gets 5 stars, but I'm only going to give it 4 stars. The biggest issue for me is the wait. I've waited as long as 45 minutes before. I think this family owned business can use an efficiency lesson from McDonald's or Chipotle or Jimmy Johns. Ridiculous! Did they just kill the cow after I made my order?",

Really like their burgers and was trying to watch the carbs so they offered them protein style. No bread and large pieces of lettuce on the outside so you can eat like on a bun. Partner I was with had the traditional with bun and also enjoyed. Didn't eat any fries this trip either but they are also some of my favorites amongst the burger joints. Thshirts only set me back 950 each",

    "text": "I'm a Cali girl, so In N Out will always have a place in my heart. But when you come to a city like Las Vegas, you just have certain expectations. Like that if you want In N Out at 5am in the morning, is it too much to ask that you be open in the city that never sleeps? Oh wait, is that New York? Well, you know what I mean.  Anyway, this place still closes at 1am, to all of our disappointment. So we decided to eat here for brunch the next morning before our drive back home.   The ginormous neon sign off the freeway isn't hard to miss. However, I am confused that the size of this location is just like any other In N Out I've been to. The line was almost literally out the door. They are obviously busy, why not make the place bigger? It was interesting to hear people in line talk about the secret menu to their friends. Being a Californian, it's funny to think we know things others don't, like we're special or something. People ordering quadruple-stacks and animal-style fries - it gave me a new appreciation for the joint.   It's not the best burger I've had in my lifetime, but I would have to say it is pretty darn tasty. I myself enjoy the toasted bun and the grilled onions. There was one point in my life where I would solely eat the animal-style fries for lunch for quite a few months (that's french fries with the 1000-island-like spread, melted cheese and grilled onions). And let me tell you, I was concerned for my health and had to eventually quit.   So although I do not frequent this place too often nowadays, I realize now that I'm not sure I would like to live without it. I have heard too many a story of people who move to different states and miss the taste of an In N Out burger...and now I truly understand.   Just be open 24 hours a day in Vegas. You are missing out on profit from post-party patrons. It just makes sense, don't you think?",

Let me start by saying I live in Seattle, WA and unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure of eating at one since they are currently only in 5 states. It's so good it almost makes you want to move to Las Vegas. I had heard about them but never investigated further. We were surprised to learn the menu consists of only about 5 items.  Yeh that's right five. Burger, cheeseburger, double burger, fries, shakes, and soda pop pretty much sums it up. The place was crazy busy with a line almost out the door both times we went but it didn't take too long to get our food, maybe 5 minutes. Everything is fresh and never frozen and they cut the fries right there in front of your eyes from fresh potatoes. The burger had a toasted bun and was amazing and the fries were even better and not greasy at all. The total bill for me and my daughter to eat was under $10 bucks. If you go at lunch or dinner expect it to be very busy. I would do just about anything to get a in & out burger in Seattle.  If you don't believe me than maybe the fact that consumer reports rated it as its top fast food burger restaurant will make you a believer. Honestly it was the best food I had in Vegas.",

We had seen the sign for In-N-Out on the way in to our hotel and my GF had never had before so we decided to try and make the trek by foot, which turned out to be an adventure on its own. This location is not exactly easy to get to from the Strip, especially if you don't know how to go. We started out on the North side of Tropicana Ave. only to get jammed up in the NY, NY/ Monte Carlo parking garage area. We headed back up and started down the North side of the freeway underpass only to get blocked again by more highways. Crossed under the freeway and lo and behold found the path which would lead us back up over the freeway and across to Dean Martin Blvd.. 5 more crosswalks and we made it! That desert oasis in a sea of overpriced mediocrity. Our reward?: a double-double (animal-style), a single cheeseburger, fries and two X-Large sodas. And the girl even got herself a paper hat.

I ordered the #2 meal which came with a cheeseburger, fries and a drink. The burger I ordered animal style, but not the fries. It tasted great with the extra sauce and added lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. The fries were very fresh and I wish I had them animal style too. I was happy to see that they give you a small salt packet to put on your fries to see how salty you want them yourself.  I had never seen a fast food restaurant so busy. The lines moved fast and there were always a steady line of people coming and going. They even had taxis stopping by there to drop off and pick up waiting customers.  Great location not too far the Las Vegas strip and the people working there had a great attitude about working there. They really knew how to keep the place moving. If I'm in the area again I know where to stop for my next burger meal.",

Unfortunately you better be prepared to wait, but it's worth it and any place that's that busy, is a very good sign. The double double with onions is amazing. The animal fries, amazing. This is probably the only fast food restaurant that isen't fast, and is worth waiting for. Right next door is a In-N-Out retail store if you want to buy any shirts, or anything like that.

It's just this particular location. If you're staying on the Strip and have a car, then you can get here rather easily. If you try to walk, grab a water bottle and maybe a Cliff bar because you're in for a hike. There is a path that gets you here, but it takes forever. I wish they could have located on the Strip someplace instead. I guess you could take a cab, but then you're basically jacking up the price of your burger.  But because it's within cab distance and easy driving distance, this location is PACKED. I mean, beyond what a normal packed In-N-Out is like. This created quite the messy restaurant. Parking looked to be a disaster as well. I will say that the service was amazing, as they were churning out burgers, fries, and whatnot like a tornado - yet the quality was still there.  Will these things keep me from going to this location the next time I'm in Vegas? No, because I don't have an In-N-Out where I live and I'm not going to let that opportunity pass me by. But the simple fact remains that this location tests your patience (even though it's worth it).",

We were wrong :( He ordered. Double meat animal style and I ordered a cheeseburger animal style ketchup instead of spread.   Once our food arrived my husband noticed he did not receive grilled onions, nor did we get fried mustard on either of our burgers. It was 10:20am, they weren't busy...not sure why they got our simple order wrong. Although our fries were the best part of the meal, we will no longer come to this location.

However, I got some tips from a friend's boyfriend about this whole \"secret menu\" business, and decided that mustard grilled was going to be the way to go.    It definitely was.  This may have been one of the all-time best fast food burgers I've ever had.  The fact that the burger comes deluxe automatically is a big plus for me.  Definitely a good decision on my part to go here while in Vegas, which I only did because of the fact they were mentioned briefly in \"The Big Lebowski.\"",

All mad just taking orders in drive thru and walk up. Restroom is filthy. Will make the drive to another in and out. Grossest in and out I have ever been too",

    "text": "Despite the busy late night rush, I received the upmost professional and understanding customer service. I ordered the wrong burger and there was a huge line. I asked the lady handing out the orders if she could alter the burger to a double double instead of a cheeseburger if it wasn't made yet. I offered to wait in line and pay for it, but all I wanted to do was place the order so I wouldn't have to wait any longer than I waited. She said she would take care of it and asked the grill person whom kindly nodded and gave her that okay.  Great team work and great service! Thank you In n out!",

    "text": "I really wanted to hate this place when I first moved out west from Chicago. After all, it's from California (gross) and Californians treat it like a god-damn cult.  Unfortunately there is some kind of virus in the air here (must be the wind patterns) that makes people shit bricks over In-N-Out. I must have contracted it because now I can't help but like it. :(  The hamburgers are decent fast-food fare as long as you add grilled onions and leave off the GOD-AWFUL spread. With the spread they taste exactly the same as McDonalds. The shakes are tasty - it's not hard to make a good shake. The fries are pretty bland but can be saved if you order them well-done.  There are so many better chain hamburgers to be had. Five Guys is way better, and Smashburger is the best. But when you're on the long, lonely road to L.A. (god forbid), the Barstow In-N-Out is pretty much the best thing along the route. And if you're a Californian tourist coming in to town, you probably can't help but be drawn to the giant sign like a neon beacon.  In-N-Out is a slightly-above-average fast food chain that, like Chick-fil-A, is good but not nearly deserving of all the hype it gets. When I want a fast food hamburger, I'll stick with Smashburger.",

    "text": "Tasty burgers.  Fries were not hot but still worth it.  There were plenty of folks in line when we got there yet you didn't feel \"forgotten\" since the line moved well.  Tables were clean and they had several staff members picking up in the dining room so all hands were literally on deck both behind the counter and amongst the customers.  Just before we left a tour bus pulled up and rushed the entryway.  Despite obviously seeing the parking lot virtually full upon arrival and the dining room packed they decided to line up at the counter anyway.  So, looks like the In-N-Out Burger franchise is humming along just fine.  Have been at other In-N-Outs in NV and CA so my 4 star rating is quite accurate.  P.S.  I believe they cut potatoes for the fires fresh in the back area...cool.",

We ordered two Double Doubles with onions (one Animal Style for the boyfriend) and two Animal Style Fries. Yes, I said two. Being in the car for a couple hours with no food makes you pretty hungry and irritated. We inhaled everything and everything was so good.  Full and satisfied. Now off to play on the Strip!",
