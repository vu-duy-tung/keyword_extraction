Thai tea drink has no flavor, requested for boba and they are out. Not kid friendly. And most of all, it's not worth the price. It's way too pricey for the food and service you get. It's not good at all. Pls don't waste your money going here. Find other place that's good and worth it.",

It smell so good on the walkway, you can see big pots steaming. It's like you are on the busy streets wanting to walk in for well, street food. The food is decent but overpriced. There's dumplings, noodles (taiwanese, chinese, japanese), rice dishes, and also a dim sum cart ranging from $6-$10. I got the roast duck soup, wished there was more broth and that the duck was still pretty tough. They offer a good drink variety such as iced coffee and milk tea also but I just stuck to water.  If you have an appetite to satisfy and I did, it will be expensive. I picked up the bill for my family and even left still hungry.  I enjoy staying here at Paris, so I will keep this place on my list of eats next time around and would probably just stick with their soups and noodles.",

Both were really good. We honestly expected it to be just ok, being an Asian place in The Paris. We were pleasantly surprised. The noodles were perfectly done, great flavor and lots of meat and veggies. Portion was perfect for sharing. The dumplings were awesome. They had great texture and good flavor. We would definitely come back. A nice surprise. Not overly priced either.",

Their duck was tender and flavorful. There was no need for hoisin sauce which most places do offer. Most of all, the service is superb. Checked on constantly to make sure we were happy. Henry definitely adds a personal touch to the customer service like no other! Friendly man with a positive energy for someone who has to work very late. Thank you Henry!",

As I am doing that, the waitress comes to our table and asks if everything is okay. While this is going on the same lady starts picking her nose with those same nasty gloves. The waitress says not to worry she is only a dishwasher. We told her that we understand but she is touchy plates and silverware that we eat out of with those gloves. She also said there was no manager. Everyone was listening to us and starring so she asked us to leave and told us we did not have to pay and that is all she could do for us. DO NOT EAT HERE",

It's not a very big place, but they only had two with a small assortment of dumplings, shumai, some pork ribs, and a small variety of the deep friend items. I got one of the steamed sticky rice wrapped in the banana leaf. There was little meat and the flavoring was off. I only tasted the 5 spice and star anise. I had also ordered their wonton soup, but ended up canceling the order because they forgot to make it. My friends had also ordered the bbq platter which had bbq pork and roast duck. Those were pretty good. Their lobster fried rice was not what we were expecting. It was pricey for fried rice topped with some lobster meat. Overall a 3 because the service other than my missing order was good. It's a bit pricey for just ok.",

For dimsum, it's quite pricey, but their dumplings come at a decent price. We had 4 people and we split their Pork soup dumplings, the spicy wontons and this fried chinese (chewy) donut filled with pork. -spicy wonton dumplings, the sauce is so good. Whatever they do here is on point. It comes with 8 pieces and are relatively good in size. I think this dish is definitely something you want to order.   The soup dumplings were small and came with 6 pieces, very little \"soup\".  The pork filled deliciousness was TOO EXPENSIVE. Basically all of your \"cart\" items are way too expensive for what you normally pay for dim sum. Probably 2-3x the price so its definitely not worth it.  -Hong kong style milk tea, thai milk tea.... I don't know if they put ANY tea, and if they do, it's highly diluted. On the plus side, it's not sweet. It's more like slightly flavored milk water. I used my yelp check in to try it and i will probably never order these drinks because its so disappointing. :(  Overall, I do not like the restaurant, but I would probably order some wontons to-go! :)   (I'll give them a second go SOMEDAY. No cart orders. SMH)",

Overall, it's still nice to have Taiwanese food as an option in a French-themed hotel.",

Each bowl of Noodle soup cost around $16.50 (not including tax or tip).  The ambience of the place was nice and clean which I personally enjoyed. Everything looked new and decently clean.  The service was also very quick. We ordered  and within 5 minutes our food came out. We were in a rush so this worked out perfectly.  The taste of the food was average as it tasted like a huge scoop of sodium/msg was scooped into our soup. We both finished our water and later felt the \"sodium\" effects in our mouth.  Overall scenario: We arrived at the restaurant around 8:10pm and immediately got seated by the hostess, ordered and finished eating by 8:40pm. We were able to make it to our 9:00pm Britney show next door at the Planet Hollywood!  I probably will not come back here unless it was the only place open and I was in a rush or something.   I don't have anything exceptionally good to say about the place other than quick service. The only had thing is there was a lot of sodium in the food which makes it quite unhealthy. Maybe we just ordered a bad dish...",

I think people are used to paying more than half the price of what you'll pay here. So that's why the reviews are what they are. But based on the taste & quality (not value), the food is delicious. Service was good.  We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup (well done but costs 3x what it should be charged at $18 a bowl with small bundle of noodles), the stirfried XO string beans (which were really delicious), and the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf (decent).  When i wanted to order an extra side of noodles, i think the charge was like $9 or $11. I forget.  Beware that it appears you will get a free milk tea or Thai tea for checking in but you'll be asked for a review first.",

Our server was attentive and made sure to refill our water promptly. Although the prices are high, it was expected, so I was prepared for the bill.   We got an assortment of dim sum as we waited for our noodles. It was was hot and tasted fresh. We ordered the Hong Kong style noodles, Tawainese beef noodle soup, and sesame noodles. All were delicious! The dumplings were large and there was plenty of beef in the beef noodle soup.  The service was great and we couldn't have asked for more!",

We came here the morning after celebrating my birthday on the Strip, so we were trying you cure our huge hangovers. To me, this usually means that I stop becoming picky with food and eat everything in sight, but I couldn't even stomach what I bought. There's only one dimsum cart roaming around the place, and the cheapest thing you can get from it was like $7 with a typical dimsum serving size. Siomai was dry and nothing special; rice was too dry to eat with chopsticks and felt hard. My friends ordered some sort of chicken over rice bowl. It was apparently bland and soggy, and it was definitely not worth the $15 they spent. I bought 3 things off the dimsum cart and spent $30 (read: ridiculous).  Conclusion: Pass. Go to Chinatown for much better dimsum. It's like 10 min from the strip. January 4, 2015",

We each ordered a noodle soup and then got 2 orders of xiao long bao to share. My won ton noodles had a nice light broth and totally hit the spot. I also tried their beef noodle soup broth and it was nice and flavorful (although oily) as well. I didn't try their dim sum, but our other friends who tried it said it was just okay.   Their prices are pretty high, but I think you pay for the convenience of it being right at the foot of the elevators at Paris. They also have pretty attentive service for a Chinese restaurant.

    "text": "Probably the saddest excuse for Chinese food. Ever. Being from arguably the most ethnically diverse place food wise (NYC), I was sorely disappointed with the quality, quality and the pricing of the food. I ordered the BBQ pork rice which is Chinese style roast pork over rice ($15.88). The bowl was primarily rice and had bunches of parsley and Chinese lettuce to cover up how little food there actually was in the dish. Overall, there was about five small slices of tasteless, bland and cold roast pork in my bowl. With tax and tip, my bill totaled $20.00+.",

I expected this place to be better because of the crowded wait and the (one) dim sum cart rolling around. It's better to wait longer for good places like Mon Ami than to resort to here.  Edit/Add: I forgot to mention that the lobster fried rice barely had any lobster on it as well (maybe 2 or 3 small pieces on top? It wasn't even mixed into the rice)! Be wary if you're going to try that out.",

When I asked what one of the dumplings was, she just replied \"tofu\".  I had to follow up to find out that it had pork and mushrooms inside.  I would be pretty upset if I ordered it thinking it was just tofu, especially if I was vegetarian.  This place is way over-priced at $50 for 4 orders of dim sum and 1 Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  On top of being overpriced, the service left much to be desired.  My water was never refilled although it was empty for the last half of my meal.  LV has plenty of better dim sum options and most will deliver to your room.",

Started off with the vegetable egg rolls... nothing but the taste of oil. I'm not sure these were even fresh. Maybe they'd been frozen for a while. Whatever the case it just wasn't good at all.  Second was the Taiwanese beef noodle soup... broth was flavorless and the noodles were soggy. At one point I wanted to ask for some hot sauce but our waiter was too busy around the corner eating his dinner. When he did come out he still had food in his mouth...

Yong Kang Street is a Street in Taiwan so it was cool to get that vibe with the decor here. It felt like we were outside.  Shortly after getting our drinks the dim sum carts pulled up! One had appetizers then the next had dumplings and other varieties. We tried the soup dumplings, shu mai (pork and mushroom dumplings) and bbq bun. I asked for a menu of what they had on their cart and she told me that they didn't have a menu. I just wish I knew what they had on the cart. The shu mai was pretty good. I wanted to try their noodles so we ordered the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup. It had a spicy sign on the menu next to it. If you have a high tolerance to spice, be sure to add the chili garlic to it. The soup was good and they weren't shy with the meat.   The severs came by often to check in to see if we wanted anything. Overall, the dim sum was ok and the noodle soup wasn't bad at all.",

I was with my friend who craves going to Chinese restaurants. I am one of the few folks who will go with her.  We saw Yong Kang Street at Paris Las Vegas and decided to do an early dinner there before catching a show. We went with dim sum. We sat outside the restaurant that was sort of a patio, but fenced in. It made you feel like you were indeed having street food.  Since this area was rather narrow, we didn't have too many carts with dim sum goodies being rolled to us. Rather, we marked what we wanted on a itemized menu with a pencil and the food came to us. We liked this method, as it allowed us to figure out what we wanted.  The dim sum quality was amazing. It tasted authentic. My friend doesn't eat pork, so I went crazy with pork-filled dumplings and other pork items. Naturally, we shared seafood, beef, and chicken dishes.  The most notable dim sum item that we loved the best was the crab claw. It was a generously sized crab claw with the perfect crunch. It was by far the yummiest crab claw that I have ever had in my life. It should be. It ran $8 for a single jumbo crab claw!  We ordered a lot of items. The prices at this restaurant are steep. You have been warned! What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, including how much we paid for our food.  If you feel like treating yourself or have won a large sum of money at the craps table, this place is for you. If you are on a budget, I would recommend going someplace else.  (85)",

However, the aroma from the food was all False hope because once you take a bite of any of the dishes then you begin to regret your choice. Don't get fooled like we did because I definitely know there are several YUMMY taiwanese food restaurant elsewhere.   What we've had: Dim sum dishes - it was A-OK and super overpriced.  DanDan Noodles with BBQ Pork - oh man was this super salty. Bleh.  Stir-Fried Udon with BBQ Pork - it's like you are eating plastic fried noodles with veggies and BBQ pork. NOPE!  Taiwanese Style Beef Soup - this was seriously the best out of the dishes. It was good. We should of just stuck with eating soup instead (ha).   Overall, I love the decor of this place. It is cute. Service was A-OK. And I still had a great time with the people I was with, but the food is a definite no go.   AS ALWAYS, NOM FOR LIFE!",

Prices are of course inflated but we were happy to pay given its location and hours they were open.  Must try their Beef Noodle Soup-- amazing al dente yellow egg noodle in a delicious beef broth. They are quite generous with their beef brisket though I did find a few pieces a bit tendony and chewy for my tastes. Good thing my boyfriend loves tendon!  They also have a dim sum cart that comes around classic HK dim sum style. We enjoyed everything we tried from the Shrimp Har Gow to the Pork Shumai. Again, higher prices than what you'd pay anywhere else but look around...you're not anywhere else but the heart of Vegas on the Strip! So just sit back, savor the flavors, and just enjoy :)",

I am pretty obsessed with their Hong Kong Style Noodles. I love how simple and delicious the broth is. You can choose your meats for it. Chicken, Pork or Duck. I got it with the duck and it was delicious! We also got a few orders on the cart. Shrimp dumplings and chicken feet. It was good! Can't complain about shrimp dumplings. The outside consistency wasn't too doughy which make it even better to eat. Not too thick and was the perfect amount for the chopped up shrimp. My mom ordered the wonton soup with noodles. For someone who wasn't hungry, she finished it lol. That mean, it was good! Freshly made and service was on point!! I love the quick service. You didn't have to wait long for a server to come by and you got the food pretty quickly. They are great! You must try the spicy dumplings. Dip every piece of dim sum in that sauce. I would even put it on my rice if I ordered some. Cheers!",

Inside is crab claw with shrimp on the outside, deep fried. So good! I took a couple bites of the taiwanese beef noodle and let the server know it was too oily and didn't want it. It was taken off of my bill with no hesitation. That is appreciated. The ramen noodles were alright as well. I wouldn't come back for their noodle soup as it's not very authentic. But their dim sum was good from what I ordered even though it was one item. I would come back to try more of their dim sum",

Understand the price is high with being in the hotel and all. So I don't complain on that.   However the reason I say it is a bad place is how they sneak in the service charge of 18% in even you are just 1or 2 person dining there. We ate there 2 times. The first time I went in for dinner and when the bill come I normally don't care how much it will be and just give the credit card. If the service charge is their rule for small party then I don't mind. However, the write that it will be for a big party 6 or more but they charge us anyway.  The worst thing was when the credit card slip come. It left blank on the tip line for people to add in again and no where to be found that they have already charged the tip.   When we went eat there again next day during lunch we only order a little and we was really surprise of how much total it was.  So my wife look at the bill detail and found that the sneak in the service charge in again. We ask them that we only 2 person why we get charge the they said it is normal since they change the rule.  So we pay without extra tip this time and vow that we will never come back again. Bad business practice. Rip off customer. Food is expensive mediocre quality.",

It is rather expensive, even for Las Vegas standards, and the food quality doesn't match the price by any means. The dumplings were tasty enough, but sparse and  lukewarm (there were only 3 and it cost $7.88). The beef in the Taiwanese noodle soup was gristly, fatty, and chewy. The pork in the pork over rice was practically non-existent. I will not be coming back. I really should have looked at Yelp before coming here. Unfortunately it's situated right off the elevators, so it caught my eye while heading to the casino. One strong drink later and this spot seemed like the best option for a late night craving, but was quite the opposite. I'm pretty disappointed, mostly because it cost way too much for less than mediocre food.",

We ended up grabbing some tasty egg rolls off the next cart that came by. I ordered Japanese Ramen that was great, girlfriend ordered beef noodles.

I came here to have a late dinner the first day we get into Vegas since we're staying at the Paris. When we were seated it honestly took almost 20-30 minutes for us to be acknowledged by the server. We ordered our drinks and that took another 10 minutes to show up. We placed our order for food and that took almost another 30-45 minutes. We saw several tables around us that just left because no one was taking their order. When we received our soup we were given plastic containers. The clear looking ones that you get hummus or dip in at the grocery store. We asked for hot sauce and the server gave us sweet and sour sauce. Under the impression it was hot sauce I poured a lot of it into my soup just o be disappointed at what it really was. I spoke with the manager about the lack of service and how I felt we were the only ones that received the plastic containers after having looked and walked around and she didn't seem to care for anything we had to say.   With the dissatisfaction I even went to the hotel front desk and being a total rewards member I wasn't pleased with the service received with that restaurant. I was told that they would inform the F&B director but have yet to receive and feedback.   If you love long waits horrible service then this is the place for you!",

The Japanese Tonkotsu Ramen did not taste anywhere near what it should taste like, the broth does not even taste like a pork bone broth, it was terrible! It was so bad to the point I need to flood my soup with chilly oil!  The smoked duck simply tasted like a salty piece of chicken in my opinion. The meat is tough, definitely the quality I expect from such a place. Note that the restaurant is in Las Vegas, the price would be high. However, the price does not reflect the quality and standard of the food in the restaurant. I will definitely not pay such a high price for a lousy bowl of ramen again!",

This was the worst ramen I have ever had! The broth tasted like literally salted water. No flavor at all. The pork chasu was unseasoned and very minimal. The only good part was the noodles. They tasted dense and fresh. For $20 for a bowl of ramen (absurd, should be $10) it was very disappointing. Just ate the noodles and left everything else.  I happened to get some pork dumplings on the dim sum cart and they were very delicious! I'm thinking maybe dim sum is the way to go at this place and not off the menu. Most dim sum doesn't even have a menu so not sure why they have one. Whatever you do don't order the ramen!",

The noodle soup was completely ruining my day.   We politely asked for togo boxes in order to not make the server feel awkward, because we did leave so much food on our plates. Guess what, i decided throwing them away right after we left the restaurant.   \"OVERPRICE\" $70 for 2, I dont mind to pay if it's worth. I guess this place should not be in the hotel like Paris.

Yes, they were appetizing and I recommend ordering these dishes, but I expected more options from the dim sum menu. Additionally, the limited amount in each dish can put a hole in your wallet, so hopefully, you win big at the casino to make up for your loss here.

I understand vegas has high prices but this is just absurd. The juicy pork dumplings were pretty gross and the vegetables were good but then again it's hard to mess up stir fry veggies. Again though for $14?! Ridiculous ... absolutely ridiculous pricing even for Vegas for what you're getting. Make the effort to take the extra walk and go somewhere else",

Mike, explained to us that the day time menu has more options and the dim sum cart has fried and steamed to choose from. However we did not feel as though we lacked anything from the evening menu. Thanks Mike for your excellent service and passion for what you do! My husband and I highly recommend you eat here. Ask for Mike!",

Order shu mai which was price point B at $6.88 for 4 pieces that lack flavor and a bit tough to chew and wonton veggie soup that was $17.88 besides the atmosphere not much flavor or authenticity. The wontons were tough and just place in broth along with a few broccoli heads and green onions and slices of cabbage. The vegetables were not cook properly and basically raw. Noodles did not absorb flavor of the broth. Pot of tea is a tea bag that cost $4.88",

Dim sum, Shrimp Sumai and Dumplings were my personal favorite. They serve an onion soy sauce for dipping. I eventually poured the sauce into my ramen and added even more spectacular flavors.   The Service: Tracy was super helpful and was very good at recommending the soup. They were accommodating and were always around to help and answer questions.   If you're looking for a place to take you away from the buffets and brunch joints, come eat here. I highly recommend it!!",

Some people might not like it like that, preferring more flavors, but if you get a beef noodle soup anywhere in Taiwan, it'll likely taste like what you get here. Same thing with the minced pork rice. If you want other Asian foods too - ramen, xiaolongbaos, you can get them here. The dim sum also looks good. Anyone complaining they don't know the prices beforehand has never been to a real Cantonese dim sum place. I checked the locations of reviewers who said that and their locations pretty much backed that up. This place is delicious for Asian food, and my parents visiting from Taiwan cast it as one of the more authentic experiences you can get on the strip",

    "text": "Well I had hoped to be one of the 5 star reviewers on this place to bring their rating up, sadly I can not. The greeters were not very friendly and were even annoyed when I asked to see the menu. Apparently it is on the wall and I just did not see it. She pointed and said it's over there as usual. Ok, excuse me for not being a usual I'm pretty sure Vegas isn't for usuals is what I should have said. I looked over the menu and wanted soup so I decided to dine.  Once at our table they asked for our drink order I mostly only drink water so I asked for that and she said you don't want anything else to drink? I said just water please. She walked away. Another lady came over asked for our order, we ordered soup with beef and rice noodles and shrimp fried rice. It took about 15 minutes to get our food.   The soup was pretty good, not the best I've had, but good. The beef they used in the soup was great with the first bite but the rest of it was all fat barely any meat. the noodles are my favorite. However, there was not enough noodles in the soup. I asked if we could have more noodles and she said sure. She brought back a totally different type of noodle and left. She never came back, I had to flag her down to let her know we needed a refill and that our shrimp fried rice was not good and we would like to send it back. She said \"It's good why don't you like it?\" I told her it tasted weird and we would just like to have it removed.  She rolled her eyes and walked away! A totally different lady brought our check over and it still had the rice on it. I asked her to please have it removed $14.99 for something I could not eat no way was I paying for that! She fixed it and came back, I thanked her and placed my card in the slot to pay. It took them another 10 minutes to come back with it.   Bad service and over priced so I do NOT recommend this place",

We got the pot stickers and the pork & shrimp siu mai dumplings. Both tasted fresh and delicious. We shared the dan dan noodles with BBQ pork which were just ok. Sauce was very thick with a peanut butter flavor and not much spiciness. Pork on top was a bit dry and chewy.   Service was good and quick, and someone came by to top off our water during the meal which I always appreciate. I checked in to Yelp to get a complimentary Thai iced tea which was yummy. Decor is charming; if you squint you could actually kind of imagine this being a street cafe in Asia. Prices are probably pretty standard for the Strip. Overall we enjoyed our meal.",

    "text": "We ate here twice over the course of three days. That should speak volumes for any who know me and my reviews, as we like to try as many new things as possible when traveling.   We were actually trying to make our way to the quick-serve crepe window down the \"street\", but my cousin and I both saw the sign for this restaurant at the same time, and were immediately intrigued.   Walking over to the hostess stand, we saw a couple ladies pushing dim sum carts, and made the decision to eat there. My husband had to join us, but I don't think he minded so much.   Our first time here, we were trying to snack only, as we planned on dining at the Bacchanal buffet for a late lunch. So it was with that thought in mind that we sat down to snack on a few items from the dim sum carts.   Let me just pause here to say that the dining area is kind of small, and not really conducive to having several carts pushed around, like you'd expect from a dim sum restaurant. And, though they give you a menu that lists the items you can find within the carts - from Group A on down to Group D - we only ever had carts B and C come our way. And the only reason we knew what cart letter they were is because of where the server placed the stamps.   At any rate, day one was all dim sum, shared between the three of us. We grabbed a few soup dumplings, some shrimp shumai, sticky rice, fried shrimp balls and bbq pork buns.   You know...snacking.   Everything was very good. Our favorite, though, was the soup dumplings. Especially paired with the vinegar (not the normal white vinegar, and careful on the pour, it comes out quick!)  Our second time there, the hubs decided he wanted a noodle dish, so my cousin and I shared a handful of dim sum, hubby got ramen, and I got a fried noodle dish for us all to share.   The dim sum this time around was more of the same (since soup dumplings are delicious!) My husband liked his ramen, which was good because he wasn't too thrilled with my cousin and me for suggesting this restaurant two days in a row. The fried noodles were excellent, with a great flavor to the sauce and a ton of fresh vegetables tossed in. Definitely enough to share, and to fill us up.   The servers we had on both days were friendly and efficient. The first one told us that dim sum is served starting at ten, so show up when the craving hits!",

The restaurant's design is stunning. I love the design of the walls to look old school and rustic. However the booths are odd, you gotta slide in still, don't expect to just enter it like you normally would.   Service was nice, nothing to complain about. I was able to do the yell check in with no hassle, unlike other yelp reviewers. Maybe something changed? Just keep in mind you can choose from Vietnamese coffee, Thai tea, and milk tea.  Ordered dim sum and 4 different noodle soups, Hong Kong style, Taiwanese style; egg and rice noodles styles.   All the soups were very \"herbal\" and have a very strong taste. However, it can definitely overpower the contents of the dish and it ends up killing the flavor of the noodles and meat.  Dim sum wise, tsu Mai was fine, however everything else didn't taste authentic at all, felt like they made everything \"authentic\" by putting an excess amount of Chinese herbs and seasonings.   Overall, it's not bad of a place but for everything to be around $18 or so per dish is excessive and maybe exploring somewhere else isn't such bad of an idea.",

    "text": "Not as good of a dimsum , dumplings and noodles for the price. They do have a dimsum cart but they have three different dimsum prices which is not clearly displayed in the cart when you pick a dimsum from the cart. They just have a paper on your table that has Dimsum A, $5.88; Dimsum B $6.88 and Dimsum C $7.88 and they mark  A,B,C depending on what dimsum  you chose. We ordered Juicy  Pork dumplings $12.88 and it was dry. I think this is their  version of Xiao Long Bao. The Shanghai Lo Mein with duck which our server recommended ,$17.88, has more cabbage veggies than noodles and it was not that savory, more on the oily side. The Shrimp Tempura Udon, $17.88, came with two small tempura and maybe three spoonfull of noodles. Overall, food was okay but not something I would say \"have to try in Vegas.\"",

One glass of coke is 3.88.... please see the attached receipt and reconsider if you want to come.   My suggestion that is the la village buffet next to it will be better choice.",

Also ordered some noodle dishes from their menu. Everything tasted good. My daughter had their spicy Taiwanese beef noodle soup but said it wasn't as spicy as other ones she's had previously from other places. If you like spicy food, I recommend trying their spicy shrimp dumplings. We enjoyed that dish the most. Would love to go back and try other dishes. My suggestion is if you're doing dim sum,  don't order just food from the menu. I guarentee you won't finish your food if you do. Unless you only order one or two dim sum dishes as appetizers.",

Sitting next to a sake bomb bar and some sushi place, Yong Kang and its giant paper lanterns stood out from the rest.  Overall the food was very typical of what you find in a Vegas restaurant - slightly overpriced food served in a area that is incredibly decorated. If i would have to guess, if feels like Vegas venues spend more time and attention to the set design of the restaurant to mask the so so quality of the food.  A few things did make this place stand out from the sea of food options. The top one being the great attitude and service of our waiter (FenFen C). She made sure to check in on our table, refill our drinks, and get out our entrees as soon as they were ready.  I would highly recommend coming here for the Dim Sum cart. yes its more expensive than your typical Dim Sum back home, but so is everything else in Vegas. They tended to have more options of Dim Sum, and the fact that there is zero wait is really great.",

We picked up the dim sum, shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings and were amazed by how good they were. They have this hot sauce/pepper mix in the table which is probably the best hot sauce I've had an Asian restaurant. Dipping the cart food in the hot sauce is probably one of the most satisfying feelings.   The entries are very large and also very good, but I'd say this place's cart food is enough to earn them a five star rating. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're not planning on making the cart food a large portion of your meal.",

Was surprised because I expect Yong Kang to mass produce for the high traffic guests passing through Bally's and Paris.  Peeked at the dim sum cart, typical options and fresh looking.  Although I did have any.  Friendly staff and reasonably priced.",

I had great noodles before at the Yong Kang St in Taiwan so really wanted to try this place and see if it was authentic. We started with some pork soup dumplings that was being pushed in the cart. Bad choice. The skin was touch and it was probably sitting around for awhile. Was not hot and fresh but lukewarm with a dried up skin. BLEH. Then we ordered fried potstickers and this one came out fresh to order and it was SO GOOD. I could've eaten another plate of this. It was hot and tasty and perfect with the vinegar and soy sauce. Lastly, we got the dried minced pork noodles that was served with bean sprouts. This had a decent flavour and it was pretty good but not authentic like the ones I've had in Taiwan as I remember it. It was a good meal but not something I would go back for. Too many other foods to try in Las Vegas! The bill was pretty high for a noodle place, but then again it's inside the Paris hotel and not Chinatown so go figure.",

Both very good and flavorful. I personally added more soy sauce and chili paste to the noodles and they tasted amazing.   The price was a bit high but of course, you're in Vegas. But for the portion and taste, it honestly was worth it.  The restaurant also had servers with little carts on wheels that slowly maneuvered through the small paths between tables. We grabbed some crispy, deep fried, chicken egg rolls and the sweet bright red dipping sauce. Yum. The flavor was great. They don't have much chicken inside, more of a type of clear noodle but still tasted great when dipped in the sweet sauce. I would order that again.   The staff are also very nice and was greeted, seated, and drinks ordered very quickly!",

Wasn't salty only down fall small portion for the price. We also had the spicy chili dumpling. Which was really good but towards the ending a little salty.  As for service our server Alex Y was great. He really helped us with the menu answered all of out questions and demands on some dishes. If you do go here ask for Alex, really nice guy.",

Their noodles are thin so u can taste the crunch every bite. Broth is rich but with the noodles it seamed bland. For the beef, their noodles are slightly thick because the broth is also slightly thick. Wonton was the least favorable.  I like how their shrimp ball is coated with rice. Thats new for me. Dimsum wasn't that hot as well as the noodles.   Note: party of 6 or more will be charged 18% more.",

The menu on Paris' website has wrong pricing info. When my husband & I sat down and were handed a menu, everything was +$11 higher. B.) There were only a few pictures on the back of the menu of their dishes, so not being familiar with this style of cuisine, I picked something quickly that I thought sounded good because I was pressured to order (waiter had been over twice in a 5 minute period) C.) I asked questions about certain items, but none of the staff aside the hostess spoke good English, so I gave up understanding. D.) Fried Rice was $20 extra E.) My Sesame noodle bowl was DISGUSTING F.) My husband's BBQ duck and pork platter was dry G.)The waiter accused my husband and I of shorting the bill when it was a honest mistake, which made my husband weary and skeptical because it's not typical of him to miscount anything. .... so, basically, we paid $80 for terrible food and terrible service. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

Yong Kang Street is on a \"side street\" off of the main casino area inside Paris and offers a wide array of dim sum off of carts as well as other a la carte entrees.   We came here right when they opened at 10am after arriving in Vegas on a red-eye flight. Tracey and Leng were our servers and they took excellent care of us. Leng was the main dim sum cart server. We loved her. She was hysterical and friendly and the perfect guide to all the delicious dumplings on her cart!   We enjoyed the Juicy Pork Dumplings, the Steamed Pork Buns (just like the ones I remember eating as a kid in Hong Kong), Pork & Shrimp Siu Mai, Scallion Pancakes, and the Spicy Chili Pork Wontons. Everything was incredible. I wish we only had more room to enjoy more of the menu!   Yong Kang Street was the first meal of our trip, and we told each other that this was the meal to beat!",

    "text": "I am extremely disappointed with this place. I'm not one to easily give such a bad rating, but I need to be honest.   This place is hidden inside the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. It's near a Japanese Sushi place and the JJ Boulangerie bakery/pizzeria. It's average sized compared to the other similar eateries around. The wait to be seated was decent, but the wait to order took way too long, especially considering the amount of staff they have that are standing around and some casually talking to each other.   My mom ordered the wonton noodle soup, and I had a few dishes of their Dim Sum (xiao long bao, shumai, and ha gao). We were shocked at how a place like this had such poor quality dishes at such high prices. Mine were all very dry with no flavor. And my mom's was bland with ingredients that didn't complement the dish very well. The table next to us also had issues with their dishes (meat in their soup dumplings were still very raw and there was no soup existent inside the dumpling).   The service here is also quite poor. There's so much staff but some either stand around doing nothing or just talk to each other. They're nice and didn't particularly do anything directly to make us upset. But we were pretty disappointed with their system and how they run this place.   Not only are we not coming back but we honestly wanted to respectfully explain and warn others about our negative experience before they decide to give this place a try.",

Yes, there is a cart that is brought around and you get the same experience as you would at a regular dim sum restaurant.  The seating is kinda on a patio like setting where you see passerbys from the casino so it is not really private.  I enjoyed most of the items until I bit into a cold piece of the chicken feet. The rest of the chicken feet was warm, but that one cold part really grossed me out. This made me realize that it was probably frozen and then thawed and heated up to be served.    Also, none of the prices were marked on the menu so we had no idea how much everything cost until we received our bill. It is double the price you will pay at a regular restaurant so keep that in mind.  Location: in Paris casino",

It reminded me of a street market.   Miso Ramen was a huge letdown, especially for the price that we were paying. No one in my party liked it because it was way too salty (there were 10 of us). The toppings were bland such as the char siu.. I do not recommend this dish.   Shrimp Tempura Udon was okay. It comes with 2 tiny shrimp tempura on the side. The udon tasted as it should, you can't go wrong. We actually dipped the ramen noodles into the udon soup to mask the salty miso.   We ordered hargow, soup dumpling and shu mai! The dimsum lady was always attentive and nice.  I had to try to get the waiters attention several times and it was a small challenge but they were still accommodating when we did have their attention.  Overall and realistically, this is in a hotel so granted,  food here will be more expensive. If you're willing to splurge and pay a little extra to satisfy your asian food craving while walking around here, this is the spot to go.",

The pleasant-looking dish was a soupy peanut sauce affair, with a nice little bit of heat, cilantro and sprouts. But I don't typically get Dan Dan that comes with a spoon because there is so much sauce, and there was very little garlic. The bbq pork was dry and not particularly flavorful. They have carts that go around with dim sum. Which might be better. Service was quick. Not a destination, but ok if you don't want to walk somewhere else, get a Lyft to Shang Asian Noodle, or pay prices at Bejing Noodle No. 9 in Caesar's.",

It is what it is. But back to the food... at best I'll give it 3 out of 10, most were bland or just drench in soy sauce. Highly not recommended to anyone, not even if you're hungry. Do yourself a favor and uber or taxi else where off the strip for some dynamite dim sum!  Btw his review was edit, changed from 5 stars and writing great things to this. A server said I couldn't just check in for my free milk tea, which was the deal on yelp. He needed me to 5 stars then with a picture while writing nothing by positive. I felt so fake, especially he was breathing over my shoulder until I press submit review...",

We get dim sum all the time at home so we wanted to see if it's up to par.   It wasn't. First off, wait staff was very unobservant we got our food before we our drinks. We actually had to ask for water. The dim sums were actually pretty expensive for 4 even though on the menu it shows u get 6. The shu mai was rubbery and tasteless. The \"juicy\" dumplings also known as soup dumplings, some were juicy and some had no soup or juice at all.   Then I tried ordering the spicy wontons. Should of avoided it. It was rubbery and had more peanut taste to it. That one had 6. Didnt finish it. Had 2 and was it. I tried so hard to want to like this place but to me it not worth it. Miss it if u can avoid the good smells that they do produce.",

    "text": "+1 Star for free drinks upon checking in and +1 Star for okay noodles!  The decor is nice, like you're sitting in the streets of Asia. It is located right as you walk out of the hotel elevators so I think it's a pretty ideal spot. It's also open until 3am. Perfect for those late night goers and drunchies. Remember to check in to get a free drink! Choices are milk tea, Vietnamese iced coffee, or Thai tea. Milk tea tasted like water so Vietnamese coffee was the best, although we didn't try the Thai Tea.   Don't order the dim sum. Is it even considered dim sum? I know we came here once a couple years ago and it was terrible. So we didn't order any this time around.  Also the wonton noodles are not good at all. Wontons don't taste like wontons and the noodles don't taste right.   However, this time we ordered the udon, Taiwanese beef noodle, and ramen. I also like it in that order. I liked how chewy the udon was and the beef noodle was interesting. I like the chewy noodle texture and they nailed it. The ramen was okay, wouldn't order again. The lobster fried rice was just typical fried rice. The shanghai Lo mein noodles were okay as well, more meat and carrots instead of noodles.   Overall this is a good place to get something fast to eat but this wouldn't be my first choice of restaurants to eat at.",

There's always a lot of people waiting to eat here so decided to finally give it a try.   The dim sum carts took awhile to come out, but went ahead and ordered ramen and the pork soup dumplings.   Was disappointed to get dumplings minus the soup.  Thought it might have just been the first one but one after another they had minimum soup inside.   Ramen was tasty and portion was generous since it was pricey.    Dim sum items were good but just expensive",

I am a fan of customer service (aren't we all) and also a fan of equal opportunity. So, I welcomed the opportunity to learn more about Dim Sum. Then came the rolling cart of delicacies.   There are different groupings (A-D) of which you are given the opportunity to select one or more items from the rolled cart to eat. I informed Ben (lovely person) that this was my first time and trusted him on making the choices for me. I had a duck, pork, shrimp, shrimp/pork dumpling. My apologies for not paying homage to the dish names. I am a work in progress.  I gave the restaurant only 4 stars because I have no comparisons. However, I must say that a standard has been set in my first visit/eating. Fun Fact: Ben told me that this is the first restaurant serving Dim Sum in the Vegas strip. Good job!",

Food tasted fresh, and the dipping sauce for my dumplings was heavenly! The freshly brewed iced tea hot the spot. I tried the chicken feet, not too much meat but it was delish. I saw the complaints of the pricing by other Yelpers, but this is average price for casual dining in Las Vegas! Server Neil was attentive and professional to the table. I only have one picture attached, I was so hungry I started eating before I remembered to take a photo. I would recommend this restaurant for quick casual dining!",

Honestly, there are better places for Dim Sum off the strip. I ordered iced green tea and spicy shrimp won tons. My green tea came in a cold can and cost almost $5. I thought it would be freshly brewed and iced, not in a can. The shrimp won tons were okay at best. There were six on my plate and it cost me $12. Honestly they tasted like frozen food from Costco. The food was palatable, but barely. For the price and being on the strip my expectations were high, but I was really let down.

They even serve dimsum which I thought was cool. We didn't try it, though.  2) SERVICE. Very prompt. We were seated quickly, food was ordered quickly, and food arrived fairly quickly.

All their dumplings were hot, yummy and tasty. And we got full! Our server was very nice:)  We knew we should've came here in the first place but wanted to eat outside since it was so beautiful. What a disappointment that was. Cold food!  Glad we decided to come here after making that mistake!  Next time I stay at the Paris I will return.  If you're looking for a quick dinner, come here! Otherwise I recommend the Pair tower restaurant! Their food is phenomenal.",

My favorite part is the cart with egg rolls and other dishes, it's a unique aspect of this restaurant, although sometimes the food is just room temperature. The tempura shrimp udon is delicious! The juicy pork dumplings (which I order religiously) are okay, they aren't like traditional soup dumplings from other dim sum places but it's good for the convenience in location and hours. I recommend Yong Kang Street for a quick bite.",

Based on the two food items I tried and a review of the items on the food cart I'd say the food here isn't too bad, but is way overpriced. What really put me off though was the service. There was a delay before someone came to take my order, so during that time I partook in one of the items from the dim sum cart - some kind of fried meat dumpling that was about on par with what I'd had at other dim sum joints but cost about three times more ($6.88 USD for two pieces). Once I finally ordered (spicy chilli wontons for just under $12 USD for 6 and a beer) the food came quickly. So quickly in fact that the condiments for said dumplings came out some 5 minutes later (after I had eaten them - for the record they were actually quite tasty).  The bill came out even faster... I was not even halfway through my beer before the waitress came out and unceremoniously dumped the bill on my table. She returned a few minutes later asking whether I was paying by cash or card. I pointed out that I wasn't even half done my beer and she apologized and went away.  Not sure what the rush was about, the restaurant wasn't even half full.  So in summary, food was okay (though mediocre if you live in city with good access to Asian food, like Toronto) but WAY overpriced, service needs work.",

Ask for soy sauce and chili sauce to add in (it will come on the side). After 4 Vegas trips I finally got to try \"the noodle place\" and it's SOO good!! On this (the 6th trip) I knew I wanted it again but couldn't remember what I got. The young girl at the podium was SUPER helpful and patient. The Wonton Noodle soup was EXACTLY what I got last time and it's just as good as I remember. I'm writing this review because I didn't last time and hated not knowing what I enjoyed. Next time, I think I might try the Vegetable Noodle Soup.   **I have had the noodles both drunk and stone-cold sober! They are delicious no matter your stage in the Vegas game ;)  Oh, and my husband got the Spicy Chili Wontons ($10) based on the cooks recommendations. The first 4 were GOOD! The last 2, the spice started to kick his butt. He finished them like a champ and said they were delicious too!!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try a noodle place and came across this restaurant while exploring the Paris casino.  It was around 11pm, which is apparently considered late night, even in Las Vegas, because the late night limited menu is what was available.  When we were seated, we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The seating area is nice, it's supposed to feel as if we're sitting outside on a Parisian patio, which it did.  Our server was helpful in explaining what our choices were on the menu, which were basically noodles and meat with peanut butter sauce, or noodles and meat in soup, as well as the dim sum cart.  I decided on the shrimp noodle soup.  It was just over $20, which seemed odd for one person, but I figured it must be an amazing noodle soup.  The dim sum cart lady came by and explained the dishes, although her English wasn't great and I only had a very basic understanding of what the dishes were, having never eaten dim sum.  I ordered the shrimp sticky rice balls (2 for $7.88) and she put them on the table and stamped our card.  They were okay, kind of weird tasting, and I wouldn't order them again.  My soup came out not long after and was basically a bowl of ramen noodles, 6 or 7 shrimp, green onions and cabbage.  (They had apparently forgotten I asked for no cabbage, although they remembered no cilantro).  The broth was pretty flavorless and really just tasted like water.  I had to add soy sauce and the spicy red sauce from the table to make it enjoyable to eat.  Honestly, homemade Top Ramen noodles in the plastic package at the grocery store is much more flavorful and way cheaper.  Our server was attentive until I got my food, then she was nowhere to be seen.  Keep in mind there was only one other table occupied in the entire place.  I had to flag down the manager who was chatting with other servers to ask for the check.  When he brought it, I had been charged for two portions of dim sum, even though I clearly only had one.  Then I had to wait to flag down our server and wait for her to fix the check before we could pay and leave.  $30 for a flavorless bowl of soup and rice balls was way overpriced, even for Vegas.  Try one of the other noodle places in Vegas!",

We had the BBQ pork/duck rice bowl, wonton noodle soup, and BBQ pork noodle soup. The meats were actually decent! I enjoyed the broth for the noodle soup but it was definitely on the bland side. The noodles themselves weren't that great either.  As far as pricing goes, it's not TK Noodles...LOL. About $15-$20 a dish which isn't bad considering you are on the Strip. A la carte dim sum was $6-$9 a dish.  Venue is small but service is good! If you use casino comps here, they still charge you tax which is odd.   Most annoying part of the meal though? Some stupid fire alarm kept on going off. Loud speaker annoucement, flashing light, and siren. It was annoying and loud. When we asked the server about what was going on...he said that it's a normal every day thing and \"no big deal\". A loud and screeching siren definitely didn't make it pleasant to sit here.  A flat 3! I didn't wanna round it down to a 2 because of the siren but food wise, it wasn't bad! If you have a craving for some dim sum and chinese BBQ, stop by! It's not bad!",

The food, however, was lacking. I expected as much due to Yelp reviews and the location.   The selection isn't bad at all.  You've got a dim sum cart that comes very often with common dim sum plates. I got the juicy pork dumplings (siu long bao). Of the 4, one was only juicy and 3 was dried up. It wasn't very flavorful and leaned more towards the salty side. I also got the bean curd roll that was very good.  Out of curiosity, I also ordered their lunch special which was the Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork. I've had these noodles in different Chinese restaurants and I gotta say Yong Kang's version was the worst I've ever had. The BBQ pork was OK. The noodles were too wet (not soggy, just wet). The chunks of vegetables were too big. To finish, it was too salty (salt and soy sauce) with very little flavor that resembles what Singapore noodles should taste like.  Oh, if you like Thai iced tea, I recommend it. It's pretty average.  Lastly, the service was very good probably because there weren't many customers. They greeted me, smiled a lot, and constantly (almost on the aggressive side) asked if everything was OK.  Overall, if you're craving for some Chinese food and you don't have the means of transportation, head over here. If not, you've better off going to Chinatown.",

I honestly prefer Panda Express over this fake Hong Kong style restaurant. Their fried rice was very basic. No reason to say, \"wow.\" Soup had a nice presentation but don't let this deceive you. The soup was very salty. The cup of noodles from the grocery stores have better flavor and probably less sodium as well. They did bring out our food pretty quickly. Its nice that someone is always walking around with a cart full of \"fresh\" dim sum. These items were also expensive. Even though we weren't impressed with our food, our server was extremely nice and attentive. She constantly checked on us to see how we were doing. She also made sure that my glass of water was always full. I expected more from this place considering their prices. You're probably better off trying another restaurant. I do not recommend and I will not be coming back to this place.",

The members in our Asian family, who are usually very picky and discrimatory in their Asian food tastes thought the selections they ordered were delicious.  We had Taiwanese beef noodle, Hong Kong style wonton noodle, minced pork over rice, pot stickers, and few other items. They were all tasty and authentic.   The service was good despite its being very busy during the holidays.   The decor was interesting and worth artistic attention.   The only thing that was not authentic was the price. But anyone who expects cheap prices for good quality on LV strips is as foolish as those who believe they can win big at the casinos.",

Plenty of flavor, everything was well done.   Service was great. Our server was very attentive and kept walking over to us to make sure we did not need anything. I would say there a language barrier since we weren't able to understand the waiter when we asked questions or the woman walking around with the cart.  I would totally recommend this place. Every time we walked by it was never full which was nice to eat at a restaurant that was not packed. I feel the restaurant is underrated Since it is not that large and there is a lot of competition around.   I did not rate it 5 stars due to prices of course it will be pricey due to location and the language barrier. Besides that the food is definitely 5 stars.",

His soup was awful, bland, the noodles were thick and gooey and the beef was touch and stringy with big chunks of fat. The waiter noticed quickly that he was devouring my meal and had pushed his to the side and was quick to offer to get him something different. He went with the BBQ pork noodles and they were delicious. We left very happy. I almost knocked a star off because of them being out of the drinks we wanted and his awful first soup.

I tried Taiwanese beef noodle what they highly recommended, it was full of flavor , and dim sum was more than 20 choices , everything I had was amazing fresh and taste good .. little bit pricey but it is reasonable , when you are really hungry at cold midnight can eat some fast hot and yummy food on the strip casinos .

It was perfect. The broth was piping hot, rich, mildly spicy, and had the perfect amount of grease slick on top. Yum!!! The beef was superb and perfectly tender. Basically melted in your mouth. The noodles were perfectly cooked and stayed firm. My boyfriend had the dumpling soup, which was mild in flavor but very satisfying. He really loved the dumplings. They were big and plump with meat.

To get a good flavor going on, we had to drench our fried rice with sriracha.  The Thai tea and HK tea are not worth the $6 price tag.",

I ordered dandan noodles and I said to my husband you want to share? The server must if heard me and assume we were sharing and walked off before my husband can even answer by the way no he didn't want to share but oh well. The noddles came and all I can taste was peanut butter! I mean they must of put a soup spoon full on the dish! Weirdest dandan noodles I ever had.

It was 7pm and we were seated immediately, so I wouldn't imagine when it would be busy enough for a long wait to be seated. Our waiter was at our table immediately to take drink orders and brought them quickly. The only negative thing I experienced was after being seated, but before the drinks arrived, two of the cart girls passed over us. The table immediately next to us got served, but we were ignored. Not sure why, but that was the only time it happened.  For a group of four, we ordered noodles and rice off of the menu, and several items from the carts. The vegetable fried rice was a little underwhelming with flavor, but the lo mein noodles were quite good. The only items I didn't like were the chicken feet, not because they were gross, but there was too much work for little meat reward; and the sticky buns, mainly because they were TOO sticky. The paper underneath would not come off without a lot of effort to remove it. Other than that, all of the dim sum dumplings, shu mai, and shrimp tempura were all delicious. For as much as we ordered, four of us getting out of there for about $100 was surprising.  This is definitely a place I'll go back for the affordable price and tastiness of the nice variety of on-demand food. Definitely recommended, especially if you're staying at the Paris and don't want to go out or dress up.",

The spicy Taiwanese beef noodle soup is pretty tasty, with plenty of beef and a spice that seems mild at first but builds.  The chili dumplings are good as well but pretty overpriced at $10.88 for six.  Items from the dim sum cart are forgettable, and the wonton noodle soup is bland, leading to the low review.  That said, I would happily come again for the beef noodle soup.",

My wife got the chicken noodle soup and it was delicious. We also got some dim sum and it was great. I got the Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup (see picture) and didn't really like it. I think the problem was that it was too authentic for me. I'm pretty sure soup contained  a blood broth and the flavor was just not to my liking. We both ate all of the chicken soup and the dim sum. The waitress noticed that I didn't like the beef noodle soup and took it off the bill for us. I think the lesson here is to know what you are ordering. Again, it was a lovely place but I just didn't care for what I ordered.",

Quality was a hit and miss (pork ramen, dumplings were delicious but the BBQ pork wasn't that great unless you like fat and slightly burnt meat). Our waiter was friendly and even tried to talk to me in Mandarin but I don't speak the language -- I appreciate it though. We ended up going across the street afterwards to Serendipty 3 to get more food and dessert (price and portions there were much more reasonable considering Vegas that is, but that's for another review).",

Yep, this place served rock-hard crispy \"vegetable rolls\" with such a sauce. Dinner for 3 cost $70! Seriously, you can eat better at Panda Express for 1/3 the cost.

We sat down to taste some dim sum - which came to us in a dim sum cart that rolls around the dining area. We had the soup dumplings and hargao. Pretty good. Not sure if it was worth the $7+ each item - but hey it's Vegas! We also had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. It definitely took me back to Taiwan. Now, of course it's not exactly the same but the flavors were really good. The beef was extremely tender. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for some dumplings or noodles.",

We chose Yong Kang Street for its proximity to our location (Planet Hollywood) and for its variety of Asian noodle dishes.  The pluses: + There was no wait and we were seated quickly. + There was a good selection of Asian dishes--noodles, rice, dim sum even. + The decor was appropriate, seemingly authentic, and not gaudy. + Our server was attentive. + The food arrived promptly after ordering. + The noodles in my \"Taiwanese Style Pork & Shrimp Wonton Noodle\" were done well, just the right firmness and not overcooked. + The serving sizes are appropriate.   The minuses: - Exorbitant prices (e.g., $7.88 for a dim sum dish that usually costs $4 in any Los Angeles dim sum restaurant, $15 for a bowl of wonton noodle soup). However, this is Las Vegas after all and every is on the pricey side. - The broth in my wonton noodle soup was bland.  Overall, it was not a terrible experience but I am certain there are better places in Las Vegas if you have a hankering for Asian noodle dishes. Not likely to return to Yong Kang Street.",

I would have had more steamed selections but the cart that came to us had more fried varieties.  That said, we ordered and shared a Vietnamese noodle soup that was delicious. We pretty much filled up on that...but we also sampled the pork bun, steamed shrimp dumplings, chicken egg roll, fried crab and steamed pork. My least favorite was the steamed pork; I really liked the shrimp dumpling and the pork bun.   I wasn't hungry for the rest of the day yesterday after indulging in all of this deliciousness. Pricing is high for dim sum but it's Vegas and located in the Paris resort....not like going to Chinatown in a big city. Still...very good food and great service.",

I asked her if we could sit inside, and she said that it was full and we couldn't sit. It doesn't matter, maybe the restaurant is going to take a break. However, I saw many times when she let other people sit inside. I don't think inside is full actually, because no one is sitting outside like us. Is she discrimination? And, when we almost finished eating, even if we didn't ask for a checkout, the waiter quickly gave us a check. This restaurant made me very disappointed in Las Vegas. If only I go to this restaurant, I will not give them any tips. Their service is very terrible. I will not go again. ,,,,,,,? ,,, ,",

I ordered the braised pork with rice after my partner mentioned it is all the rage in Taiwan now.  I like pork and I like rice so it sounded excellent.  The dish came and right off the bat, the rice was too wet.  I hate soggy rice.  There was a side of cabbage and two small  broccoli florets. I suspect they scooped the cabbage along with the water onto the rice.  The pork itself was tasty and tender. It was the fatty bacon part of the pig-- Mm fa laam for those of you who speak Cantonese.   My partner ordered stir fried noodles with chicken. Hers tasted ok. Nothing to write home about.   I will give them a second chance the next time I'm in Vegas.  Maybe try the wonton noodles.",

    "text": "Although it seems that most people go to Yong Kang Street for the dim sum, I was really just craving a good bowl of noodle soup.  Through our walks down the strip, the boyfriend and I always pass through Paris and have frequently looked at Yong Kang Street and wondered if it's any good. We admit that we're pretty spoiled with Asian food, so it was a hard sell to get us to stop by. On this particular day, my craving for noodle soup was stronger than our skepticism.  The prices at Yong Kang Street are typical Vegas prices. aka WAY higher than what you would pay at a typical restaurant. I mean, nearly $20 for a bowl of noodle soup? My parents would kill me.  But we did it anyway.  First off, there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free HK-style milk tea, Vietnamese iced coffee, or regular coffee. We opted for the first two, and they tasted pretty great. A bit on a sweet side, but the tea and coffee flavors were both there.  Taiwanese Style Beef Noodle Soup. Spicy, by my standards (which you should know are not very high at all -- I'm a spice wimp). It's definitely not the best beef noodle soup ever, but the broth is rich and flavorful. The chunks of meat are substantial in size, but I do wish there were a few more.  Hong Kong Style Wonton Noodle Soup. Surprisingly decent. Large pieces of wonton filled with shrimp and pork and tasting pretty authentic to what I would get in a HK-style cafe. I will say that it's a bit strange to see broccoli in this when there is traditionally bok choy, but eh. We rolled with it.  Service in general is hit or miss. When we first sat down, our server was attentive, but after our initial food order, it took some effort to flag someone down for anything else (despite the fact that the area itself is actually not that big).  Not entirely sure that I would go back simply because the prices were pretty steep. Maybe if I hit a few jackpots, I'll be willing to dish out $20 for some noodle soup.",

    "text": "Not the best dim sum, but you can't expect much when it's located within the Paris Casino. The staff was really attentive and friendly and the food arrived fast. I liked the decor of the restaurant that's made to mimic the streets of Taipei.  SPICY CHILI SHRIMP & PORK WONTONS ($10.88 for 8pc):  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2P2ZaoE&s=a9094d1a969d36b7a8e2a0f0d61ef7163544f6064ca17b37c5800056d6db4d55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2P2ZaoE</a> I counted only 6 wontons.  - Tasty mixture of shrimp and pork was seasoned well. The spicy chili sauce was also very good. Probably the best dish we had here.  SOUP DUMPLINGS ($12.88 for 6pc): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Q8o7vn&s=85ff2f355393e3093dcd5acf79692138a9b6f4c3ecb0faeae8f71949c4fe418a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Q8o7vn</a> They only gave us 4 pc. Pretty disappointing since the dumplings arrived dry, flat and void of any soup.   DANDAN NOODLES W/ROAST DUCK ($17.88): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2P4kM3R&s=1fb443010d8213caa0741afea1e9431fb6899000f0d5ae7fcf142f5fa692ba99\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2P4kM3R</a> I've had my fair share of DanDan or TanTan Mian and this was not it.  It's supposed to be either a ground pork in a spicy chili sauce or a light spicy sesame sauce. Our arrived with a thick peanut butter sauce that was not very appetizing.  - When I asked our server about it, he said it's supposed to be like that, \"it's supposed to be peanut butter sauce\". Nasty. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2JwA0Ja&s=ea25303ceedbbbd7b82ddbc293076cd46237c48a3de8555b7f73a80779a5ff1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2JwA0Ja</a>  Over 20 varieties of dim sum cart items ranging in price from $5.88 - $9.88. There's no menu list for each item, you just have to trust that they're stamping the correct boxes on your tab. Pretty terrible system on top of the already inflated prices for dim sum that normally than $3-4 bucks at better dim sum joints.  BLACK BEAN SPARE RIBS: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2ESJIXn&s=d1b6a28d87b9a55c7f5278ac4e6a6169fa2a8571859c82737f73a8ab740c82be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2ESJIXn</a> As you can tell from the pic, it's missing the familiar black bean gravy. Bland to say the least.  FRIED SHRIMP WON TONS: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2qkR7Vx&s=1dc545338c86644c0b659919701554dbc1db65b13f0fddaa164525157e4ed830\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2qkR7Vx</a> Two huge wontons filled with a lot of whole shrimp. A bit greasy but tasty. Can't go wrong with fried food.  SHRIMP&PORK SIU MAI:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Q8nyBL&s=f772280b43a46d73dce65ddc12f52ca1375a74d6760fd4fe608d3c99c23dae52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Q8nyBL</a> It tasted just like the spicy shrimp&pork won tons without the sauce. Good, but I've had better.  LO MAI GAI/STEAMED MOCHI RICE WRAPPED IN LOTUS LEAVES: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Pv79dC&s=6ea08fd0dce43f51ee0d16551fc57362d7d3897cfab9029efe4223f79b670c24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Pv79dC</a> This was one of my favorites because the mochi rice had the right consistency of what I'd expect for Lo Mai Gai.  I also loved that it had a generous portion of ground seasoned pork and chunks of lup cheong mixed in with a tasty gravy. Probably one of the best Lo Mai Gai I've come across yet.   BLACK PEPPER SHORT RIBS: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Ss0bER&s=1e21cc51cae1478f01da32a5f2d334bfae96ebb79460e0b15ad89aa5ddd520f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Ss0bER</a> Bland and hard to chew. I looked like a starving rabid dog trying to bite into this. But since it was overpriced, the Chinese part of me was telling me to not waste.   Let go, Let God.  Hours: Daily from 10am-3pm Located within the Paris hotel & Casino, parking is $13 for 4 hours, $18 for 24 hrs.",

We knew we couldn't miss picking up our tickets at will call so we made a decision to have dinner at the hotel.  We were very hungry when we got there, but as none of the many restaurants and delis we walked past interest my husband until we saw the dim sum cart at YK Street. So we pulled in, was quickly seated.  In no time was the cart there and we picked out our favorites, har gow, baked pork bao, custard mini pies, DUCK, pork shumai, and some other fried shirmp and vegetable won ton. Oops, and I can't forget the house fried rice with beef, chicken and shrimp.  The service was great.  Great atmosphere. Food was great. Then my husband looked down at the stamp card and realized, it's expensive, like twice the cost compared to the other dim sum restaurants off strip. Well, it is the strip, it is a popular hotel and we're hungry, plus we got free show tickets, so this one time is okay. But that is the only reason why this gets a 4-star instead of 5.",

Them little dumplings are utterly addictive, one bite of the incendiary chili oil and the explosive flavors, there is no turning back.  In a place called Paris, deep in the heart of The Strip, you will find them. Shrimp and pork hand wrapped are floating in cilantro, green onions, and a special chili oil mix. Just the right amount of heat and savory flavors makes for a delicious snack.   I can't walk past Yong Kang Street without stopping in. My 48 hours in Las Vegas, I must visit at least three times!",

Yong Kang Street answered my prayers by not only having pho, but also every other kind of noodle soup you could think of. My friends and I got a bunch of different ones including pho, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, wonton noodle soup, and bbq duck noodle soup. We agreed that the Taiwanese beef noodle soup was BOMB.   Shoutout to Lun for checking up on us and making sure we had everything we needed. If you want hoisin sauce, just ask! There's also a check in offer for a free drink. The Vietnamese iced coffee was strong and tasty, and had a hint of chocolate.   We left Yong Kang Street feeling more alive and ready to take on the rest of our night. We even tried to come back the next day, but there was a bit of a wait :P",

Thought I would get her some comfort food while we strolled through Paris.    This place is tucked away but a really cute oasis.  They had dim sum carts, noodles and regular dishes to order.  We giggled as some people had never had dim sum before and would ask what the cart was suppose to be addressing.  Wait staff would yell \"they're appetizers\", unique spin and makes sense. They had a diverse amount and 2 carts passed by, fried cart and a steamed cart.  Really like the separation between the 2.  Would love for them to add some sobe/udon noodles.   It wasn't like our fav dim sum places but it hit the spot.  Only recommendation, don't get the juicy/soup dumplings.  No soup to be found and the dumpling just wasn't good.",

You won't miss this place it also has a sushi place right next to it that's also really good. The soup wasn't oily at all or overly salty it was perfect. I haven't tried anything else but I'm sure it's all good. The service is good they are pretty on point.

We just walked in, and we were the only ones waiting in line and the lady mentioned 30 min wait and she said to write our name down. Then we thought about it and we're like ok we can write down the name, then she is like you just have to be here we don't take names. I asked her how many people in front of us, and she said it's just us. Then finally she said we are next so it should just be 5 minutes. We got the table in less than 5 minutes........  But just the way she was talking was like she doesn't want business and she could have mentioned we're next anyways instead of all the discussion above.  3/4 of us are vegetarian, but 4th person who ordered dim sums really liked them. I ordered fried rice and it's like any other fried rice so I can't complain. Other vegetarian food were average so it's probably more for dim sums.",

There isn't a gigantic dim sum menu but all the classics are there:  shumai, shrimp dumplings, egg rolls, fried dumplings, etc.  My favorite dish is the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. Very tasty, classic Chinese food--fresh bok choy & generous tasty won tons. Their Taiwan beef noodle soup is also a classic and delicious--savory generous portions.",

The service was good, but seriously, the food, how can anyone on this forum say anything good about it? Relatives, friends? Surely they have to be. I have been to several Asian places, and this is by far the worst I have ever been to, in fact, the worst food I have ever eaten in any restaurant all over the world.

I've heard one person complaining it was tasteless while the next person said it was too salty. In case you have never eaten Chinese food or noodles, umm, it's salty., but In a good way. The next beef seems to be that it's expensive. Yeah it's expensive. No doubt you can find the same meal somewhere for at least half the price, not sure where but I'm sure they are out there some where in the slums of vegas. You won't find it in the strip in the middle of a huge casino hotel. They have to pay rent to be in such a prime location. So you get to pay for the convenience. As for the food. Absolutely amazing. Super fresh and off the charts. We didn't mind one bit paying the bill. It was one of two restaurants that we ate at that made our entire trip to Vegas worth It.",

With that being said though I'm hoping that they take this to heart and improve.  My husband wanted to order white rice to go and maybe a few other things but the hostesses were simply unhelpful.  First, they said that they don't do to-go orders after 10 p.m. but it was 9:45 p.m.  So they let him order.  Then we asked what do you get for the different prices of dim sum- crickets...they had no idea.  We asked if they had siu mai- no idea.  Asked how much har gau was...not a clue.  And best yet they didn't even want to go to the dim sum cart to find out.  So, we got our $3.88 order of white rice; our $8.88 har gau (which is a RIP OFF); and, some pork dumpling thing that she insisted was siu mai (IT WAS NOT).  Educated your staff as to the food you serve.  Sad...",

The Vietnamese noodles were tasteless and did not come with hoisin, basil or bean sprouts. The Taiwanese beef noodle was good, not spicy as advertised, the meat was soft and tasted like oxtail. The summer special stir fried udon with bbq pork was heavy on the sesame oil and just ok. The shu mai and har gow were forgettable. The egg tarts were good but overpriced for two (better in San Francisco). Best thing- they had baked char siu bao which my husband and the kids enjoyed as snacks.

The waitress told us that we could change the broth from beef broth to vegetable broth! Yay! This won a few extra points in my book. There weren't that many restaurants that offer this. The vegetable noodles were absolutely scrumptious. It's a good portion of food. It isn't as flavorful as other noodles that I have had, but if you add some sauce its pretty delicious.   I also ordered the spring rolls. This were perfectly crisped. For two egg rolls, the cost was $5. What knocked one star off this restaurant was that the prices were steep. I believe for my vegetable noodles were $18.   The waitress was very nice and the service was speedy. When we first arrived at the restaurant there was a line of about ten people. We were seated in 10 minutes or less. If you consider that it was New Years Eve, this wait time was excellent.   This restaurant does have a Yelp offer. I wrote this review after my experience at Yong Kang Street. The waitress didn't ask me to write a review before in order to receive the free tea. The free tea did not sway me in writing a more positive review.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located inside the Paris hotel. My husband and I were looking for a place to have dinner and I was originally set on a Parisian style restaurant, but I couldn't pass up this cute restaurant. I'm a sucker for atmosphere. We were quickly seated and greeted by our waiter. I noticed that our table was quite wobbly so I folded up a napkin and placed it under a leg of the table. A worker saw me do this and alerted other workers to come fix our table. About 3 people rushed over to help out. We weren't very bothered by the wobbly table but they insisted on fixing it and even told us we could move. We greatly appreciated the help.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a free beverage. Normally it's one offer per table but our waiter said because it was New Years, we could each have a free drink. We choose the Vietnamese coffee. It was sooo good. I love strong coffee. We also ordered some juicy pork dumplings as an appetizer. These dumplings are filled with a broth. These are a must! We were sitting next to a worker on break. She saw me looking perplexed about the condiments on our table. She kindly informed me what each one was.   For our entrees, my husband ordered the a Japanese ramen and I ordered the Vietnamese beef noodles. It was so much food. We were so stuffed by the end. Menu items were reasonably priced for Vegas. Also, it's nice that they have a variety of Asian food on their menu. Our waiter and all the workers were so friendly and attentive. We were very impressed by the great service, food and atmosphere!",

I ended up ordering the Vietnamese Iced Coffee and the Pork Ramen and Pork Dumplings. All items were prepared to perfection and I was completely satisfied.

First thing that greets you is a cart with several appetizers, you can select what ever you want on the spot and it gets added to your bill. Prices seemed reasonable for Vegas, for it being a quicker bite, and for it not having a wait. We shared several appetizers such as pork dumplings (highly recommend), chicken egg rolls (highly recommend) and shrimp friend wontons (save your money). Our main entree was the chicken lo mein, which was not greasy and very tasty! The bill does add up with the $4 iced tea and the $7 appetizers. Don't get too carried away with the appetizers! Total was $55ish with tip, could have eaten at a nicer place for that, but it was a nice experience.",

    "text": "I love the restaurants inside the Paris hotel. You get to feel like you are dining al fresco with their faux cloud ceilings and winding paved walkways, without having to actually sit outside in the desert heat (yes, please!).   My friend and I had just finished our massage appointments and were starved, so we suggested meeting back up with my husband here since it was a halfway point between the Bellagio (where we were) and our hotel (the Mirage).   They weren't busy when we arrived, so we snagged a table next to the main walkway for optimal people watching views. We ordered two beers and their steamed pork and vegetable gyoza to snack on while we waited for my husband to arrive. They were delicious and disappeared from our table quickly.   They also rolled over a dim sum cart filled with piping hot treats and gave us their group menus to help determine what everything was. Group A is $5.88 an item, B is $6.88, C is $7.88, and D is the most expensive at $9.88 a piece. We were more in the mood for noodles though so we decided to pass on the cart offerings.   Once my husband got there we ordered another appetizer for the table, this time being the spicy chili shrimp and pork wonton dumplings. Those are addictive! I could have easily put away 4 more plates of those by myself. Don't say I didn't warn you.   For our mains we got hot sesame noodles with BBQ pork, and hot Dandan noodles with chicken (you can get their noodle dishes either hot or cold). The peanut sauce on the Dandan noodles was perfectly balanced with notes of sweet and heat, but the sesame noodles were probably my favorite because of that yummy pork. It was smokey and fall apart tender.    This meal really hit the spot and was perfect for sharing. It's a little on the pricey side, but that's to be expected of most places on the strip.",

I'm a pescatarian so I'm glad they have a lot of seafood choices!  They then stamp your paper with the different group pricing.  We're still eating.  I think we'll spend about $50-$60 for 2 people and I think it's reasonable for all the food.    The service so far has been great.

Because if you are expecting Chinatown dim sum with a huge variety of dishes at a (hopefully) cheap price, this is not that!  There is very little that is cheap to be found at a Vegas Strip hotel restaurant.  That being said, I really enjoyed this place and I think it's a nice addition to the cuisine available at Paris.  I had just got out of the ER for food poisoning (no stars - do not recommend) and wanted to eat something that was light enough but would give me a bit of energy.  Dim sum and noodles fit the bill so I was happy to see this spot.  They do only have a couple of carts, one with steamed and one with fried, but the har gao I had were pretty good and I had some good pork and vegetable steamed dumplings.  We also ordered a vegetarian noodle plate and it was full of fresh vegetables and was really tasty.  I think it's definitely Vegas prices, but also the portions were large and the food way very good and just what I needed.",

We came for the dim sum and it was very limited. It's definitely catered to people who are dim sum \"newbies\". They had a couple of the dumplings (shrimp, soup, etc), chicken feet, fried shrimp, duck, etc. They were pretty decent, nothing spectacular or awful. The soup dumplings definitely needed soup though. I also ordered a plate of stir fry udon and a stir fry veggies. The udon was surprisingly good but the veggies was pathetic. You basically get some cabbaged, carrots, 2-3 pieces of broccoli and that's it. Panda Express does it better...  We paid rougly $100 and ate less than what we usually eat at a regular dim sum place and it probably tasted better.  Overall, I have learned my lesson, rather take the time to get Uber to Chinatown for better dim sum",

Conveniently located in the center of the strip in the Paris hotel. Was sat very promptly and the food came out in less than 5 min!! They also have a dim sum and appetizer cart that comes around (that's what the little piece of paper they give you is for) you grab what you want off the cart and they mark it on your paper. Super cool. As for the shrimp noodle soup, absolutely loved it especially since the broth was NOT super salty or greasy. It had flavor without feeling like it was clogging you're arteries as you consumed it. Last but not least, the hk milk tea was awesome, don't expect it to be like a super sweet bubble tea. It wasn't too sweet, the tea and milk taste had a perfect balance, definitely recommend.",

I should have tried harder to resist on a recent last-minute trip to LV.  The siu mai was mediocre in every way. The har gow was barely warm, but it was hotter than the spring roll which was straight-up cold. I had to send it back, which I am always loathe to do.

Our server, Mike, was especially excellent with his customer service! Very welcoming and took his time to make us feel like we were at home. He makes sure that you are having a great experience even through the madness that is Vegas. On top of the food, I will definitely return due to the wonderful service provided by Mike and the rest of the staff.",

    "text": "This is where I went when the Gordon Ramsay Burger bar @ Planet Hollywood disappointed me.  This little gem is located in the walkway between Bally's Hotel and Paris Hotel.  It is classic Taiwanese Cuisine complete with a dim sum cart and homemade noodles.  There are different levels of dumplings and offerings in the cart so beware you may be grabbing a $5.88, $6.88, $7.88 or a $9.88 tin.  When I went these were not marked so you really have no idea the price when you point to it so just beware when scarfing the yummy dumplings down.  We also ordered BBQ, Beef Fried Rice, and Lobster Fried Rice which I honestly could only eat a few bites of because I filled up on food from the cart.  This is also a noodle house, so next time I will be trying the noodles.  It was a spur of the moment thing and I did not have time to figure out how to order.  With time and the internet I feel like I will be more equipped next time.  Here is my full video review: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fs73yx3LXkM8&s=93a5958c68df2422fb80d44e6c7939549ef0b53d4e433253c158c593884f2b61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/s73yx3LXkM8</a>",

I love their dim sum. More specifically, I love their chicken feet. The feet are not too sweet and a have a little bit of kick to them. I just love the suck the yumminess off those little toes. They have a whole assortment of fried and steamed dim sum too. I also like the sticky rice and pork wrapped in the banana leaf and the shrimp dumplings.  If you don't like dim sum, I would recommend the duck and rice or a bowl of their soups. They are all yummy.   The restaurant is open really late. I often get a midnight snack from Yong Kang before heading to bed too. You can even use your points from your Total Rewards card to pay for your meal. Just have them check to see if you have any points to use.",

It warmed me to my soul. Haha!  I found it interesting that they have a server with an appetizer cart and you just pick what you want from the cart. I'm so impatient, I hate waiting for the appetizer and then also waiting extra long for my meal. So I thought that feature really added to the overall experience. We sampled the steamed during and pork dumplings from the dim sum cart. Also had fried shrimp from the cart that looked like it had a bunch of fried items on it.  The spot is quint and the great for a casual night with friends or a loved one.   Totallyyyy recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "3.5 stars!  Yong Kang Street serves pretty decent Cantonese & some Taiwanese food in Vegas. My friend ordered the miso ramen and said it was delicious (didn't get to try).  Food I ordered:  1) Wonton Noodle Soup @ $17: The soup was flavorful and not too heavy. The wontons inside the soup were pretty large and meaty; although not the best wontons I've had, not the worst either. The egg noodles were just OK - I picked a lot of it out since I didn't want to be overly stuffed before heading out that night. Solid 3.5 out of 5 stars.  2) Choy Sum @ $13: This is stir fired with garlic. Not amazingly tender but it was fresh and crunchy. Good option to get veggie intake in Vegas. Also 3.5 out of 5 stars.  3) Beef noodle soup @ $20: I asked for extra spicy but it wasn't spicy at all - you've been warned. The beef was very tender and fell apart easily so that was really nice. Wish there were more flavor to the broth - it tasted good but was one dimensional. Noodle quality was better than expected though - chewy and al dente! 3/5 stars for average.   Overall, Yong Kang street is a good option at the Paris Hotel if you're craving Chinese/Cantonese/Taiwanese cuisine. It's decent, especially for being on the Strip! Expensive, but not unexpected for Vegas prices.",

Fast, efficient, knowledgeable and runs this restaurant like a seamless orchestra.  The food is good and prices are reasonable considering it's right on the center strip and inside a main hotel like Paris.    What makes this restaurant particularly enjoyable and keeps me coming back is the seamless execution.  From the moment you arrive, you're greeted by the hostess, from water glasses were brought by the waiter assistant, to excellent, speedy and knowledgable wait staff, to an excellent restaurant manager Gustavo!

The dim sum cart is a cool feature and they have a cool atmosphere, it really feels like you're on the streets of a foreign country.  The fact they can pull off that kind of environment is a plus in my book.    We had some egg rolls, dim sum and shrimp something while sitting at the table waiting for our food.  None of them were more spectacular than something from Pei Wei or Leann Chin in my opinion.  For my entree I ordered some combination of beef and broccoli with rice and had no complaints.  I did stay in my comfort zone though, if I could do it again I might try something I don't usually order since everything coming out appeared good.  Sake was served cold and so was the beer, altogether it wasn't too expensive either, solid choice...",

The concept is great - with dim sum carts rolling along and lots of noodle dishes, mostly Taiwanese.   However, in the end, not one dish was as good as any decent Chinese place in San Gabriel or Arcadia in So Cal, nor did it setttle as well.   Besides being super expensive, at eight bucks per dim sum and over 10 for a small bowl of noodles... but I spent the entire next day on and off the porcellin throne.   And it wasn't just me -- my friend who I went to Yong Kang with had the same problem.  I reall wish it was better. But FYI... Las Vegas has a great Chinatown - with good dim sum in carts on weekends and great Cantonese BBQ & Seafood places for dinner. There is also excellent Korean in Vegas. And the Chinatown is only 10 mins from the strip.  Bon Appitite.",

A Vegas casino restaurant is not usually going to be as good as that small family place down the street due to their scale, but this one was good.  The only complaint I would make is limited choice on the dim sum carts and that they spent more time talking than wheeling around so they were leaving money on the table. Mind you the dim sum dishes can add up if you have a few.  Other people have complained about rudeness but the staff were polite to us.",

The prices were expected to be pricey because it was located in the Paris hotel. I ordered the wonton noodle soup , priced at $18.88. It was fresh and tasty. I am giving the rating 2 stars because the service was terrible. The waiter was rude and inpatient to me when I asked him menu questions. I was solo and the place was not busy at 1 am. Honestly, the only person nice to me was the busser who was helpful and packed my leftovers and gave me a water to go.",

I was pretty impressed and drawn to the place since I noticed they served Dim Sum in the evenings, which is not normal for a Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the brown rice, which was so freaking dry i couldn't even eat it with my chopstick, the hagaw and siomai  tasted like they were old, dry and had no flavor. But I did not stop there, since i was already there i decided to have the hong kong style wonton soup which was $14 for freaking soup! The wonton soup had thin noodles which felt like it was never ending, and the wontons had shrimp inside them, the broth was okay nothing special. After i got the bill i had a bad taste in my mouth! The food was pricey and not as good as dim sum restaurants in china town. I felt like we were paying for the ambiance just because it was inside the Paris hotel, The reason why i gave this place a 3 star was because the service was great, not your typical Chinese restaurant that's for sure! If only they cooked like your typical Dim Sum restaurant I would have given them a 4 star.  Overall, I may go back to try their other soups, their service was great, ambiance was nice , wonton soup was okay.  i did not enjoy my dim sum at all because it was too pricey and the quality was not good at all.",

I am now currently the savior and we have plans to eat here again tomorrow before our flights. Good dim sum, loved the pork and shrimp, great duck and noodles soups. I've been to China and we all know it's gonna be slightly Americanized but overall was AWESOME!",

Service is amazing and food comes out within 5 minutes of ordering. I got the stir-fried ramen with lobster the first night (it was HEAVENLY) and the next, shrimp tempura udon. I recommend the ramen over the udon, but both were fantastic. Spring rolls are also great!   I'd come here again and again if I could. Definitely delicious and fairly reasonable for the amount of food you get.  TRY THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "I came here with my family for some lunch. This Chinese restaurant is located in the Paris casino.  The layout of the restaurant is really cute. It looks like an open air cafe in the streets of Paris or something. There's cute lights hanging from the sign, and tables \"inside\" the railing as well as \"outside\" the railing (so it looks like you're eating on the street).  The menu is mixed dimsum and ordering entrees. To my amazement, there was actually a woman pushing a dimsum cart around the tables. But be warned that it's Vegas and the prices are a lot higher than your usual dim sum place. Small, medium, and large orders are closer to $7, $8, and $9 per dimsum order.  I thought this place wouldn't be that good but I was surprised by the quality of the food. The pineapple bun dimsum was pretty good! The buns were very fresh and large, and the pineapple bun coating/shell on the top was delicious. It was probably the most expensive pineapple bun I purchased from anywhere ($3.88 for two buns) but it was still good.  The xiao long bao came in an order of 4. It was decent, but I thought the dumplings could have been a little bigger and juicier. Probably not worth the I think $8-$9 for a small order of 4.  The dan dan noodles were interesting. The sauce was excessive so it almost looked like a soup noodle dish when you get the bowl. But I thought the sauce turned out well, since it was really peanut/sesame flavored. It was also quite spicy too! I ordered duck with the noodles (you get a choice of meat), but I didn't think the BBQ duck went that well with the dan dan noodles sauce.  The ramen broth was a bit too watery for my taste but mild enough for my dad.  Scallion pancake was good too, although it's just the pancake, no egg like my mom would make it at home!  Also don't try to get Total Rewards points here. It doesn't seem to work, and after talking to the Total Rewards desk, you can redeem your points here but I think the minimum was like 200 points for $1 (hardly seems worth it especially for casual Vegas goers like me).",

The layout of the restaurant is pretty cool- styled to look like a Taiwanese noodle shop, with a dim sum lady going around with the carts. We had a fairly large group (10 people) but they were accommodate us quickly. Service was quick and attentive, with no mix ups with the orders. One friend ordered the roast duck and the rest of us got noodle soups. I ordered the Hong Kong wonton noodle soup- it was huge and satisfying, and the wontons were stuffed with meat and shrimp. Food was good but a little expensive for what it is (but its Vegas, so I guess everything is expensive- but then again, I'm from NYC where things are expensive, and the price of the noodle soup surprised even me) Totally A-OK place",

Even though I'm a CBC, and prefer non-Chinese food, after 3 days of heavy eating, chowing down on one's grass roots is a natural phenomena--I think lol.  So during my many frequents back and forth Paris/Ballys/Planet Hollywood, and passing by YKS and their super long lineups, my first initial glance is, 'nah, made for westerners, I can eat this stuff at home'...  Eventually curiosity got the better of me, and despite the high prices (which I can accept, it's vEgas, it's our crappy Canadian dollar), I just have to try it out.  Besides, mostly Asians were eating here, probably for the same reason lol.  First off, the veggies were great.  Bak choy at this stage, my body needs it.  Wonton noodle, pretty decent too.  And the broth wasn't as loaded with MSG as to be expected.  Roast duck, pieces-wise adequate in itself, and we're not exactly in Chinatown, so for $18, whatever.  now, we were totally impressed by the service, spoke Cantonese a few times.  Unlike other restaurants, it's OKAY to order just cold water--what's even cooler, is that they topped up a few times too.  Liked the picnic style seating along the wall.  Yes, long lineups as usual everywhere, and honestly, not worth the wait if you're short on time.  But a nice change.",

It did hit the spot--great flavorful broth, well cooked chicken, very delicious noodles, and the addition of broccoli was also very nice. The chili oil they bring you adds a nice taste it as well. I asked for limes and the server brought my lemon, so its definitely not pho friendly, but again its a good noodle soup that can substitute for pho when you need it most. I would say it was a pho/ramen hybrid.  Overall it was delicious with good service but I'm not sure I would go again unless I really needed something late night. It just may have not been my taste. But I would recommend :)",

Ordered noodle soup but the dim sum cart was still going around for anyone that wanted it.   My husband got the wonton noodle soup and said it was good. A few big wontons and a ton of noodles. I had the BBQ pork noodle soup and it was great. Exactly what I was looking for. Lots of noodles and a decent amount of meat.   I will definitely be coming back here next time we are in town!",

Won Ton Noodle Soup - broth was good, though not enough for the amount of noodles given; won ton was tasty - only given 3 pcs, and are not Shrimp. Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup - fair, of course, and no where as delish as on the streets of Taiwan.  No free tea here!  And not even loose leaf tea! $4/pot.  Unless I'm dying of hunger, I'll pass this restaurant on my next visit.",

I've walked by this place every time I'm in Vegas and I always just assumed that a Chinese restaurant inside a hotel called Paris didn't scream authentic. We stopped by at about 1 or 2 in the morning and it was just incredible. Tasted great, the broth of the noodle soup wasn't too salty and still had flavor without being a thick soup. The only critique I have would be the service. It was just a little bit on the abrasive side; a little rough around the edges but other than that and the fact that the spicy wonton wrappers were a little thick. It was perfect. Price could be a little lower for the quality of food and the experience given but you are on the strip and this is to be expected. I would recommend one visit just to try it out but it wouldn't be a repeat for me unless I was craving this specifically.",

The skin was soft and not crispy like a roast duck should be :(. My plate had loads of nappa cabbage on it, looks like a filler for the lack of duck.

    "text": "Pretty good spot in the Paris hotel and casino. The ambience is very nice in the sense that it resembles Taiwan night markets and has a warm feeling. The food is also pretty decent considering the chefs are straight asian. Only thing I don't like is the price. I mean, 20 bucks for a bowl of soup?! I get the concept of the rent they have to pay, but I just can't justify spending that much food I've paid for little for my whole life. Even if it's due to location.   3 stats for this one.",

It is mostly a first come first serve basis for being seated, unless they run out of your sized table then they go through the line to match the party size with the table size.   We were seated and within 5 minutes they came around with dim sum carts. They women with the carts rushed through what they had o the point where we had no idea what she said. Took over 10 minutes for the waiter to come by to just take a drink order. We almost got up and left because it was taking so long.   We ordered vegetable spring rolls, vegetable noodle soup, and pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup. The soups came out within 5 minutes. Spring rolls about 5 minutes after that.  Everything was hot and delicious.   Took about 10 minutes after we finished eating for the waiter to even come back. Saw him walking around and assisting other tables but never paid us much attention. Waited too long to get the check. Overall, the food was delicious but the service was pretty bad.",

The server, Tom, was also fun to talk to and helped us order rather quickly and we were reminded to do the yelp check in for a free drink which was cool! Sometimes I forget and it's great to be getting that reminder(:",

    "text": "This Vegas getaway started with an unexpected stop for sushi in Henderson. So why not let the unpredictable continue? Who wants some Dim Sum served in a setting that resembles Chinatown in Paris?  Once again, my girlfriend and I allowed our experience combined with luck to make the decision where to eat. Yong Kang Street looks like part of the Disney-esque setting. Somehow, the Paris street scape inside morphs into a comfortable, themed patio setting for the dining room. And with the kitchen on full display, it's difficult to resist.  One unique feature of Yong Kang Street, is the Dim-Sum carts that are constantly passing by loaded with steaming hot, tasty morsels. After three or four passes and constant \"gotta try that\" urges, we agreed that we had grazed enough. In fact, this meal passed so quickly, not that we were rushed or in a hurry, that I didn't get any photos of the food. Until Desert.  While the assortment of appetizers and Lobster Fried Rice were all wonderful, so was the fruit flavored Mochi (ice cream). Green tea is typical and refreshing. But I enjoyed the raspberry and mango best.  It was a different kind of dining experience. Everything was freshly prepared and the chefs were all working non-stop. Plus our server Soo Mi was wonderful. Yong Kang Street is on our \"must visit again\" list.",

The menu says there is a 18% forced gratuity for 6 people, and when we asked why they forced it on us(without telling us beforehand) for 5 people, they said it was due to holiday weekend. Overall not worth it, just go to a buffet or head down to chinatown for equally good food!",

The dimsim was marginally better than microwave dimsum. The shrimp noodle soup surprisingly hit the spot. But none of these warranted the one star rating. The service was the worst I've had at a food establishment. After receiving our food, our server (I think his name was Michael) completely disappeared. We finished our food and we did not spot him once. No one came by to check on drinks or anything. We had to flag down a random server to get our check. We then waited around trying to flag anyone down to take  our payment and we were about to just walk out since no one was there when we finally saw our original server and flagged him down. He walked over, grabbed the book without saying a word or looking at us, and a long while later, came back and dropped off the book. Again, without a word or acknowledging we were even there. I don't expect much after midnight and I wasn't looking for world class service but literally the only words we heard from him the whole night were literally \"What would you like?\" and \"This is your wonton soup. Wait. I think that's the wonton soup? Wait what did you order? Oh yea this is the shrimp noodle\".",

I own and operate restaurants and never have I seen such poor hosting service. The ladies you have in the front are obviously clueless at hosting. Two ladies just looking at us like deer in headlights. I understand coming as a party of 7 takes longer than seating 2 or 3. But the option for us to be seated separately and sooner should have been given to us. Instead the hostess just keep seating everyone that came after us. After waiting more than 35 minutes we just had it. Advice to this establishment change your hostess ladies before they really chase everyone.  Hostesses are your first impression to how your shop runs even before the food. So take some advice and have your hostesses learn some proper etiquette to hosting guests. No one likes to be treated in this manner. It's Vegas and you guys are in a big casino you have to have your A GAME on. Please avoid all this restaurant all together. Don't waste your Vegas time with this place.",

When our plans changed, I tried to cancel. I could not cancel on the Open Table site, but it did give me a phone number to call Yong Kang Street directly. When I tried to do that, there was a recording that said that the mailbox was full.....\"goodbye\". I didn't want this negative item on my Open Table account so the next day when we were in the area, I stopped at Yong Kang Street to talk to someone. The hostess informed me that they were not taking Open Table reservations, even when I showed her a copy of mine with the confirmation number. She also said that the system was down and she could not fix my reservation. Huh? Are they taking reservations from Open Table or not? I informed her that I tried to cancel my reservation by calling the phone number that was provided and she suggested that I discuss that with the manager. UGH! We won't be eating there, even if it's good if that is the way that they manage things.",

The decor is neat as well, and most of the seats have good vantage points for people watching.  A pair of chicken egg rolls was $7, and not really better than what you can cook from frozen. The spicy chili wonton dumplings were amazing! Tasted really fresh and delicious. The menu says pork, but they also contain shrimp, so be advised. I also had the dandan noodles with chicken, and I did like them quite a bit. Never had dandan noodles before so nothing to compare it to, but it was spicy and flavorful. The chicken was just shredded white meat added on top of the noodles, but there was plenty of sauce to keep the meat from being dry.  I'd say skip the dim sum and go for the noodles to fulfill your drunken carb cravings.",

The shrimp won ton is crispy & greasless with suculent seasoned shrimp; perfect with the sweet & sour sauce.  The crab balls are crispy with a wonderful crab filling & the shrimp dumplings also crispy with a well seasoned shrimp filling; both perfect with the formentioned sweet & sour sauce.  The juicy pork dumplings aka xiao lung bao are wonderful, I will be it very small than what you are used to at other restaurants; stioll, the wrappers are delicate with a well seasoned pork filling.  The sesame balls are crispy, coated with sesame seeds & filled with smooth red bean paste.  The egg custard tarts are some of the best yet, very flaky & creamy; my aunt especially raved about them, having owned a bakery with her family growing up.  Round it off with a Ching Dao & you will not be disappointed.  I deinitely be back to try the main dishes next time & go for dim during lunch when there is always more avalable.  So, for wonderful Taiwanese dim sum in a casual atmosphere with friendly service at reasonable prices, Yong Kang cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.",

It definitely was good but with eye-gouging prices!! I understand it's the conviences of it and the restaurant is inside a hotel but for two bowls of noodles it cost 50$ with tip. Which is outrageous for noodles. I recommend the spicy beef noodle soup because it was good. If you're  really craving Asian food at 2 am while in Paris try it out.",

This was about 9pm and the line at the buffet snaked around like a Disneyland ride. It was very tough to gauge since part of the line was hidden behind walls.   Half of us were willing to wait while the other half said the noodles smelled great and there was no wait.  They won and here we came.    They service dim sum, noodles, and rice.  Service was good but it should be since 18% Gratuity is added unto parties of 6 or more.  There are a lot of funky named things on the menu we had to ask about and Im asian!  I ordered the Duck fried rice since I rarely get to have duck.  For $18 I expected a good sized bowl but it was rather small so I had to get some dim sum.  It is True dim sum where the roll around the carts.  Selection wasn't great but got some Har-gow at the tune of $2.00 EACH!  My rice was quite tasty I must admit.  My friend ordered some sesame noodle plate and it was oddly gritty.  But someone else got duck noodle soup that was delicious.  I would probably give a 4 but it was SO expensive for what you got, that it drops down a star.  It can easily be $25-30 per person but for a noodles?  My rice was good enough that I would return but no dim sum or drinks this time! lol",

It was just inside the easy indoor passage way that links the Paris Las Vegas Hotel with Ballys so that was super convenient. I ordered a soupy noodle dish with duck and my wife had the pork over rice. We also split an order of pot stickers. My noodles were delicious as was the pieces of duck although I would have liked it had my pieces not been so boneheads. The pork over rice was even better it was ground pork nicely seasoned with Chinese five spice and it had sacallions tossed into it as well.  We were also tempted by the dim sum cart that came around but we opted to just stick with what we ordered. Given that it was an eatery in a first tier hotel on the strip the prices were a little on the higher side but not cost prohibitive. I would definitely go back I would just order what my wife did.",

In all honesty, even if I had time I likely would have eaten the dim sum because it is one of my favorite foods of life. I sat by the gate and while having passerbys watch you while you eat isn't my favorite atmosphere being squished between that and lanterns/Chinese-esque decor on my right was nice for a short time.   The taste of all the food was good. I got pork shu mai, soup dumplings, sticky rice in a banana leaf, and fried crab/shrimp puffs. Everything was comparable to other favorite dum sum locations like KJ in the Rio and Yum Cha. The only thing that I didn't eat was the fried crab/shrimp puffs because I didn't know when I ordered it that they wouldn't have mayo to dip it in. I've never been to a place that didn't automatically provide mayo with puffs like that. This place gave me a sweet and sour sauce that I would not recommend.   Lastly, it's expensive. I didn't knock off any stars for this because - duh -it's located in the Paris on the strip. I paid $40 for 4 different plates and an iced green tea. At a local place this lunch might have cost $20. I didn't feel ripped off though because the service, food, and atmosphere were pretty good. I'd come back for a quick lunch but I am not running out to the strip just to eat here anytime soon.",

Our food didn't come out at the same time, my friend is vegetarian so she got stir fried veggies and a side of rice and I got shrimp tempura udon. Right after we ordered, her rice came out, about 5 minutes later, my udon and then a few minutes later her veggies finally came out, resulting in cold rice. We wanted to try the dim sum cart as well but the two carts only passed once and the people pushing the cart both looked at us (I made eye contact both times) and then continued on looking forward like they never saw us. Everyone else had dim sum and looked happy with it, so I assume it was good. Both our dishes were heavily salted but otherwise OK (besides being way over priced, but it's Vegas). I was hoping for the experience to be a bit better.",

I love the Asian hipster steampunk look this place has going on. The waitress and staff were awesome and very friendly.

It was just too much food for the two us. If we were to go again, we would split 1 noodle dish. The dim sum adds up quickly. But all the food was great.",

The decor seemed to capture a street market feel where you can find a seat and be served an assortment of small plates and soup with dim sum and off you go when done.  To step into this world, there a friendly hostess to seat you.   Once seated my order was taken- I ordered iced green - I find that to always be refreshing as a starter.  The menu is not complex. Very simple offerings.  I decided with the pork steamed potstickers : chinese bbq pork: and when the dim sum cart came by, I chose the chinese bbq pork Bao buns.  The bbq pork over rice & vegetables came our first along with my bao buns.  I ordered chinese hot mustard ( yes, this will clean out your sinuses!)  I split opened the bao bun and stuffed a bit of the vegetables on top of a bite price of bao. I smoothed on a sliver of hot mustard and took my bite.  Crunchy vegetables with sweet bread & bbq pork, such a great combination and then somewhere in the middle of that experience your hit with the spicy sharpness of the mustard.  The pork steamed potstickers arrived. Now these little bundles are meant to be a package of fine steamed pork meatballs sitting in a nice broth to maintain it's juiciness. And it was.  However, it was still hot! I nearly burned my tongue- totally my fault- so be forewarned!  These tiny pockets of deliciousness was just perfection with every bite.  Overall, this was my early lunch in the busy facade of the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  You can get standard Chinese food anywhere, but if you're looking for something  little extraordinary. Step off the path and have a seat & enjoy an experience.  :)",

We were seated quickly. Drink order taken and food order made quickly also. Since we had not been here, server Mike made a few suggestions which turned out to be great. Kids were happy with their milk tea and Thai tea (free on YELP check in). We're not big on dim sum, but since my kids didn't make any complaints and finished plates I would say pretty good food. Wife and eldest really liked spicey noodles. Sorry I cant remember all plate names. Good dinner alternative to buffet.  Visually I liked the location. Reminded me of eating in a curbside restaurant? Chinese lanterns, posters, etc... give it cool feel. Would go again.",

Their sticky rice w/ pork though was not as great although large portion so very filling. I would come back! Very expensive dim sum though, but it is Vegas. $17 for two plates. Normally that would be less than $10.",

They have dim sum carts that go around.  You may need to flag them down.  We must not have looked like we were familiar with dim sum, because they carts passed us by several times.  But after asking our server to send them over, we were not over looked again.  Good selection of dim sum to chose from.  We did ask for several items that we did not see on the cart (we lover dim sum) and were happy when they showed up at our table.  Everything was fresh, hot and comforting.

The first night I had the chicken over rice Taiwanese style.  I get what they're trying to do. They're trying to imitate Hainanese chicken rice. But it was a little bland. But with that big of a portion, I was willing to eat it with some soy sauce.  The second time I dined there was after having really fun time with my husband in bed. I always get super hungry after we do the dirty. I came down here, ordered fried rice to go and right after I signed my receipt, the food was ready! I was worried it was going to be really bad microwaved fried rice but it actually wasn't. Tasted pretty good! I'd probably eat here again if I ever come back to vegas.",

All were delicious. The har gow skin was not to thick and chewy, perfect amount of starch to it.  The sticky rice dumpling was great with its moist sticky rice, yet not overly steamed and dried.  Only downside to the meal was the spicy pork dumplings which we thought had too much chili oil in its sauce. It made the meal overwhelmingly too spicy, but still flavorful.   The Vietnamese coffee was not too sweet with enough of the black coffee taste.   Overall the price is decent for the quality and service provided. I do, however, love the variety in the menu!",

First, I intended to order a big meal but there was a cart of dim sum being wheeled about and soon I was full on vegetable egg roll and some sort of tempura shrimp. I've never had an egg roll that was so light yet so deliciously dense before. I highly recommend it. Their dim sum portions are extremely filling and should not be missed in favor of the unknown Epicurean delight that is the rest of the menu.   The woman next to me was there almost exclusively during her trip and she swore by every soup. I did not get a chance to try any but I include her recommendations. On my second trip, I ordered the spicy shrimp dumpling to go and while I was waiting, I ended up getting two kinds of wantons off the dim sum cart that wheeled by me.   I ended up eating my dumplings for breakfast cold and still found it to be spicy and flavorful. It was a great place to get a quick meal to go but also worth dining in as well.",

I was hoping the paste would've been a bit more pronounced.   The Shanghai Lo Mein we ordered was very good. We ordered it with duck. Lots of roasted duck and Vegas were in the in the lo mein. It had an awesome authentic Chinese taste too.  The service was great! Thanks Ken and Lin (?), but it was a bit pricey. Probably visit again.",

As always, my husband got his favourite Dan Dan noodles.   I always get couple of different proteins from the Dim Sum tray and steamed rice.     We love Chinese beer (not very strong) and ordered a bottle of Tsingtao and a bottle of Lucky Buddha.  Both were delicious!  My sauteed beef over squash and shrimp/crap on a sugarcane drumstick were delicious!  There's something about a mix of the spicy, salty and sweet that just hits the spot!  I also checked in on Yelp and they gave an iced tea which was delicious!!  Overall it's a great place to relax and enjoy a meal.  It's not a fancy place and it's kind of like eating street food in China.  I guess that's part of it's charm.    If you're looking for good food and a comfortable place to rest away from the gambling scene, this is great place.  It's located inside Paris.  By the towers entry.",

However, they were flavorless! Plain noodles/rice and chopped meat. I had to pour some of my dumpling dipping sauce on my noodles just to finish. The meat didn't have any flavor.   I won't be back, no matter how good the ambiance and dumplings are. There are endless other options in Vegas where you can blow $70 on two people.",

    "text": "After a long day of hiking and gambling, we wanted some Asian soul food. Yong Kang is inside the Paris Hotel and Resort where we were staying. We went there out of convenience and laziness to leave the hotel.   The restaurant shares air space with the casino floor. It's decorated to look like a food alley in Asia. It's quite appealing and reminds me of some places I have visited during my travels.   We were seated immediately at dinner time, and was quick to order an appetizer out of their Dim Sum cart. We got  \"Ham Shui Gok\" which is a fried mochi-like dumpling with meat inside. I had no expectations coming to this place since most Asian restaurants inside casinos are mediocre and target non-asian foodies. I was impressed at the dim sum for it was comparable to some of the best I've tried.   We ordered the Hong Kong Noodle Soup with Duck and the Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice for our entree. Both dishes, to my surprise, were actually very delicious.  The Noodle portion was normal, but the fried rice portion was definitely small compared to what were used to. For the price we paid, we expected more in quantity.   The Fried Rice and Noodles we're both about $17. The two Dumplings costed $5.88.  The only downside to this place is price, but you can't complain when it's literally outside of your hotel elevator.",

    "text": "Sigh. Even worse than the typical casino \"Asian\".  I ended up here because I was checking out Paris (pretty meh, IMO) and I was interested by the dim sum concept. They advertised \"20 varieties\"'and perhaps that means that in sum total of the existence of the restaurant they have served 20 kinds. Because when I visited it was like 6 things - egg rolls, wontons, shrimp tempura, sesame buns etc. YAWN. I picked a chicken egg roll and it was served barely warm but tasted fine.  For dinner, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was pretty terrible. The broth was off tasting, they used sweet BBQ pork (tough & gristly too) and added sweet corn? Wtf? It combined to be very odd indeed. I think it depends when you visit because I saw photos where regular pork was used. It seemed like they thought \"well, we got this gnarly ass leftover pork, let's use it because this girl won't know better\".   Now, you might be thinking \"well, what did you expect, ordering Ramen in a French themed casino?\" And you would be right - that was a dumb move. Do not be stupid like me and order ramen - in fact, do not order any food here because it is not good.  What is good? Well, the wine prices were not bad for Vegas and the pour was strong. Service was great - really attentive. Still, unless you're craving what is essentially Panda Express, steer clear.",

Our server told us that the free drink is only for people who give them a good review on yelp. So, I would have to write a \"good\" review on yelp and \"show\" it to her and only then would she give us the free drink.  I am guessing a lot of 5 star reviews here are in exchange for a free drink. Fake reviews all around!! Not at all expected from a decently high end place like this.  Horrendous. Scam. Fake Reviews.  The food wasn't bad though. We had dim sums and the Singaporean noodles. The noodles were good, dim sum was decent- a little too dry for my liking. However this is Las Vegas, there are tons and tons of great places to eat which do not ask you to write a \"good\" review and \"show\" it to them for a free drink. Better avoided.

    "text": "After we dropped of all of our stuff in the hotel rooms, we went downstairs and ate at Yong Kang Street. Stephanie S. and I thought it was pretty funny since we just got back from Taiwan (with the real Yong Kang Street), but our group was down for some dim sum. It turned out to be the most expensive dim sum we've ever had!  A small order was about $8 and noodle dishes were $20 or more. All of the dishes were just okay. When you tack on prices that are 3 times more than usual... Yikes! Lesson learned: When in Vegas, don't eat Chinese food. Surprisingly, for a group of 8, we only paid $25 each.  For these prices, you could definitely eat better elsewhere in Vegas!",

That's it for that price???!\",and the cart was only offered once....I thought they are suppose continuously come with more options....  But at least you get an option to choose entrees from a menu, offering dishes from other Asian menus (Vietnamese, tiawaneese...) me and my boyfriend ordered the minced pork meat over rice (only because so many reviews said it was great), it just tasted \"bleh,\" and makes me leave thinking \"I should have just gone to get McD\"  The best part of my meal was the ice latte my boyfriend got me next door",

However, the service needs to be improved. 1st time got soup on my pants while the waitress was trying to take the plates away without any notice while I'm working on another dish, got offered 20% discount fine. 2nd time was forced to buy more dim sum than we need, because they were literally threw dim sums on your table and let you to try them, while keep saying the dim sums were good!  4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the price, 0 for the service.",

The downside of this place would be the high price of everything- but they are located in a hotel and the quality of the food is really unbeatable. So I think it's totally worth it!",

I came with family and we also got the Singaporean noodles with chicken and house fried rice. Both were pretty average by my scale. I feel like I could've made either dish myself.

If you have the car and the time, head to Chinatown or even inside Gold Coast for great Chinese food for a third of the price or less.   Alas, I had neither a car nor time and had to order to go to back to my room. I've given this place a few chances previously and have had a few items. The beef stew noodles were barely passable, but was too greasy. The lobster noodles were a farce, you get pieces of frozen rubbery lobster meat added to a low cost noodle soup and get charge what could be a whole lobster elsewhere already. Dim sum items were ok but costly. The only thing I figured out was consistently good was the roasted duck and BBQ pork items.   BUT- they cheat you on the to go orders and give you meatless-skin-on-bone-only pieces. Figuring you couldn't be bothered to go back for replacement or complaints if you were in a hurry! So be sure to check before walking away.",

The food itself was ok, but not the best noodle soup I've ever had, either. Thus the 3 stars.   Would I go back? Yes. Mostly for the convenience, but also because I know that their food tastes good and the service is also good. I think I'd rather have a sit down meal, to enjoy the decor and ambiance, instead of just doing take out.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this place by accident.  I have probably walked past it a hundred times and never noticed it.  We were able to get seated pretty quickly and found that the place had an upbeat and vibrant atmosphere.  It was clean and comfortable.  A great place to hang when you want a fun night out.  While the food is a little pricey, you pay for the location.  I kind of like the fact that the prices ended in .88.  We were on the Strip and didn't feel like heading out because we were on a roll.  The Dim Sum cart had a great offering.  The food was flavorful, salty and delicious.  I enjoyed the Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce.  It was savory and salty.  The broccoli was cooked al dente and had a nice firmness to it.  The spicy won ton dumplings were full of flavor.  I would have preferred them spicier, but then again, I didn't ask them to be spicier, and being in Vegas, this restaurant has to cater to all types of people.  Like my mom.  She thinks that the pico de gallo on a fajita at Chili's is too spicy.  This would have probably killed her.  So, we have covered the price, touched on the ambience, and talked about the food.  What's left?  The service.  It was attentive.  It was seamless.  I didn't have to ask for anything as my needs were anticipated by the staff.  It didn't disturb our conversation and we almost didn't notice it, which is the best service there is.",
