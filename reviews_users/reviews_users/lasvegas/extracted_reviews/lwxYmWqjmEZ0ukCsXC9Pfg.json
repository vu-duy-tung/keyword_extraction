I would say the only con is the wait. There's could be about a 40 minute wait for a table, and then the food also takes about 40 minutes to make.  It if you ask me.... it's sooo worth it",

I would suggest getting an appetizer while you wait, but we ordered the sampler, and everything on the platter tasted like frozen grocery aisle stuff. Nothing special.  Getting here is pretty annoying, but if you've got that nifty Nevada ID handy, take advantage of the free 24 hour parking at Cromwell and walk across the street. Don't park at Bally's/Paris just for this. You're better off spending that walk time waiting for your pizza.  The pie is good, but just didn't meet the overhype for me. Yes, Chicago style is different, but I've had better (and faster) here in town. I'll leave Giordano's to the tourists & diehard Chi-town evangelists for now.  I will say that our server Justin was on point. Best service I've gotten in Vegas in a long while.",

    "text": "As part of a bachelor party, we ate here on a Thursday. A group of 5 guys, we were just looking to have some deep dish pizza.  Upon arrival, the restaurant is very hipster and modern in decor. I guess it's just part of being at Vegas. We were greeted with our server and we placed our order pretty quickly. Respectfully, he did warn us that the pizza will take an hour. We really didn't believe him but we were hungry so we ordered some fries to get started.   The fries were pretty good, had good flavor and was a bit greasy, something you expect from fries. We finished that basket of fries an be at the end of waiting about an hour 15 minutes, the pizza finally arrived. Honestly, we were getting tired of waiting. So be forewarned that you will be here a while before the main entree arrives.  The server actually served us the slices, something I actually never experienced being a NJ/NY native in a restaurant. It was also my first real experience with deep dish pizza, so take that as you will.  The pizza slice was heavy. The crust was able to support itself still. Loaded, with cheese and sauce and bread, this one large pizza was perfect for our group, with two slices each.  My only gripe with the pizza was that it was poorly cut. The eight slices were not equal in size. Obviously I'm not expecting perfection here but some of the slices were extremely small compared the ones next to it. Typically, this wouldn't affect me when I'm with my girlfriend but I got handed the two small slices by bad luck. Not a big deal but I felt like I wanted a couple more bites.  Overall, this pizzeria has really good pizza for a decent price in Vegas actually. We had some at another place around the corner for a quick pick me up a couple days later and that was overpriced and tasted like frozen pizza.   It loses a star for the long wait. We wanted to eat here or even but they take out urinal pizza but that would have taken 40 minutes to cook and we needed to leave in a bit for our flight.  Overall, good pizza but long wait.",

Hopefully getting pizzas out to tables more promptly will rectify the problem as running it outside is not where the problem lies. When you already wait for quite awhile for your pizza to cook I kinda didn't want to wait anymore for it to be re-heated.  Also plans are in the works to get the water filtered for the downstairs dining area. So for future diners, things looks very promising for you to have a good dining experience. Management takes negative feedback seriously. I commend them for that.  My next update review will have to be when I return to Vegas. Maybe another three years?",

We sat right away and our pizza was ready within 40 mins. I highly recommend their boneless buffalo wings. They taste so goood + they keep u busy till ur pizza is ready. The most amazing thing about their deep dish is that the crust is a bit crunchy. Usually with deep dish pizzas the crust gets soggy. I a medium pizza was more than enough for the 2 of us. I think it could easily feed up to 3-4 ppl! LOVE this place. I'm so glad it's in Vegas now!",

Nothing too impressive about them.  But we knew the wait for our pizza was going to be a while, so we got them to tide us over.  The real winner here is definitely the deep dish pizza.  We got the Cheese Deep Dish and added Pepperoni.  Although I personally didn't really taste the pepperoni, the thick, gooey cheese was everything!  I love pizza of all kinds, and this was more than I expected.  I kept the side of ranch from the fries and dipped the crust in it.  So good!!  The servers were nice, friendly, and very attentive.  The view of the strip from where we sat by the windows was exciting.  We watched the Bellagio fountains!  Our wait was short, and we had no complications with parking because we walked from our hotel.    I had a great experience here and can definitely see myself coming back whenever I'm in Las Vegas!",

They have both covered patio and indoor seating with friendly service. Deep dish does take some time to cook (expect ~40 minutes from when you order), so we had some mozzarella cheese triangles and garlic cheese bread while we waited. I really liked the cheese but could have done without the bread, despite their menu making it seem amazing.  Two of us shared a small deep dish and only managed to get through 4 of the 6 slices. They're also willing to go half and half on the toppings, so we did bacon/onion and pepperoni/sausage. The crust is tasty and probably the best you'll find in Vegas.  I miiiiight advise against lunch here as it does tend to sit a little heavy.",

    "text": "This is my second trip to the Las Vegas Giordano's.  The first was at the end of last year, just after they opened, for a sit down experience.  Tonight I visited their pickup window below the restaurant.  It is like a dream come True - I can walk up to the window and get an individual Giordano's stuffed pizza.  They have 4 kinds - spinach, cheese, pepperoni and sausage - all ready to go.  The price is around $10 for each of them but the luxury of being able to get Giordano's without traveling all the way to Chicago is worth it.  I wonder how many more times I will go there before we go home?",

Don't go here if you are pressed for time.  It was well worth the wait.  We had their Small Deep Dish with Sausage.  It was outstanding.  For an appetizer, we had their Bruschetta.  The Bruschetta was practically a meal by itself.  Big plate loaded with tomatoes and sliced mozzarella cheese on a nice mini toasted bread.    They have two different locations in the Grand Bazaar Shops outside of Bally's.  One is an outside seating area located in the middle right after you come down from the escalator  from Bally's.  The other one is at the top of the escalator and is an indoor location.  Use indoor location when it is really hot outside.  We definitely will be coming back to this place.",

By the time our deep dish came out, first thing I noticed it wasn't even HOT or by that even warm. It came out pretty cold, I was pretty upset.. why wait 45 minutes to only know your pizza will be cold? I don't think I'll ever waste my time here again. How are your wings going to be better than the deep dish?",

They told us the deep dish takes 35-45 minutes, which was fine with us. We ordered the appetizer sampler and greens salad to snack on while we waited.   My friend and I had flown in that evening so we were starving. 20 minutes goes by and no appetizer or salad. I kept trying to find our waiter but he was no where to be found. After 30 minutes our appetizer sampler arrived. I asked the bus boy who delivered it where our salad was and told him we had been waiting forever. 10 minutes later our salad came out. I'm not sure why it took 40 minutes to bring our salad but when it arrived it was drenched in salad dressing and soggy. We barely touched it.  After an hour of sitting and waiting our pizza finally arrived. I was excited to finally get some real food. The appetizers were comparable to snacks you'd find in the freezer section of the grocery store. But the pizza was absolutely horrendous. I had one slice of the veggie and was completely disgusted. The sauce was gross, the veggies weren't fresh. It was just gross.   The service was slow and rude on top of it all. And they never even checked in to ask how things were. Overall a horrible dining experience.",

I'm very upset. Im keeping my cool and just ask for a full refund....I'm then approached by a very kind and understanding manager I believe. I forget what her name is but she offers to take me to a separate bar and eating area with with AC and to refund order and give me the meal on the house...I accept the offer and my order is brought to me soon after...And let me tell you this is the best Spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had, I wouldn't mind paying double the price for it, it was absolutely amazing...The bartender working at the time was very helpful and nice as well as we talked about sports...Shows you how quickly an absolute NO STAR review can be turned around to a very very good 5 STAR!

So first off, this is the first Chicago style pizza experience I've ever had so I was very skeptical if there'd even be a difference. I went big with the deep dish baked pizza. After ordering I didn't eat it promptly. I actually took a nap to prep for the Vegas nightlife. What made this pizza so amazing is the fact that I reheated it in the microwave after being in the freezer and it tasted AMAZING. I'm sure we've all been there before with left over pizza and that hard unbearable rubber like bread but this tasted amazingly fresh. I was blown away. The 2lbs of cheese just goo'd out from every slice. The sauce tasted amazing and the bread tasted fresh out of the bakery. I don't even know how that was possible. I'm sad that I didn't get to go back before I left and looked online to see if they sold them frozen because I'd definitely pay to get them shipped. It was just that good! Also, definitely not eating any other type of pizza anytime soon! #imonstrikeuntilicaneatthispizzaagain",

We got chicken wings, potato fritters, and a thin crust Chicago classic pizza. BBQ chicken wings were amazing. Nice and big with a great tasting sauce it was better than typical chicken wing spots. Potatoes fritters were also great. They were pretty much little deep fried mashed potato balls. The BEST part f the meal hands down was the pizza. I decided to opp out of the deep dish pizza because the wait is 45-60 minutes because baking one is essentially like baking a pie. The crust on the thin crust (what we got) was crispy and delicious. The Chicago classic has mushrooms, green peppers, onions,and pepperoni. While dining we were greeted by a manager I believe her name was Erica. She was very nice and it was the perfect finish to a great meal! We will definitely be returning soon.",

I arrived at the upstairs indoor and was warmly greeted by my waitress Courtney. I knew what I wanted and ordered a salad as well since I knew pizza would take a while. When I received the Greek salad, it had no Feta and no tomatoes. (Annoying). But the manager came over, explained they were out of feta and the kitchen forgot the tomatoes. He profusely apologized for the mistake and offered another salad but at that point I was hangry and just ate my delicious salad albeit without the salty tasty delicious feta I was anticipating. Then they offered a free dessert and ended up comping my salad AND discounted my pizza 50%. Mistakes happen, I get it. For me, it was forgiven in the recovery and the fact they were empathetic and made the situation right. Plus the food was boooooomb! Go Giordano's if you want great service and some delicious pizza and salad! I took my Tiramisu to go and plan on going back to hotel and eating it in my pajamas. Hehe.",

The downside was that it was really loud and I thought we would have to leave-music, people walking by, lots of shops right next to you, and we were seated right next to a TV that was loud enough for everyone to hear the NBA playoffs over all the other noise.  We mentioned this to our waiter and he turned it down.  After that, it was fantastic and we enjoyed eating outside.  Our waiter was one of the best we have ever had at a restaurant - unfortunately, I am horrible at remembering names.  And the pizza was delicious as it always is at Giordano's. It was the best meal and service we had in our trip to Vegas (which included meals at \"big name\" restaurants).",

After waiting too long to have our order taken our server, Chris, informed us that pizza takes around 45 minutes. We sat there for over 45 minutes with empty beers as we didn't see him again until he finally showed up  - with the WRONG pizza. In that span of time I could have ordered from Dominoes. It would have arrived earlier AND would have arrived correctly. Not wanting to wait another hour we ate the pizza we didn't order, a plain Chicago deep dish. It was just average.",

I wasn't too sure about this Chicago type pizza.  And I made the wrong decision.  Perhaps I don't know what Chicago deep dish pizza is.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza.  Wrong decision.  BBQ sauce was waaay overpowering.  All I tasted was BBQ sauce.  I had no idea chicken and onions were included.  And the crust is kinda like a pie crust.  Way different than any regular pizza.  I guess it was my fault.  I thought maybe the next day it might taste better.  But nope.  In the garbage it went.  Luckily my $30 gambling win covered this meal lol.",

However, my boyfriend had drank a little too much and fell asleep at the table. There were 6 of us and I for sure thought we were going to get asked to leave. Instead Josh was very accommodating, refilling the sleeping mans water and very attentive to those of us eating. He was knowledgable about the menu, drinks, grand opening, etc. The calamari appetizer was great and any deep dish pizza is to die for! I cannot wait to go back! Thank you Josh for being friendly, providing great service and making our lunch a memorable one.",

Then upon bringing the pizza out, they didn't even serve the 1st piece to any of us & when I asked, she said your waiter will do that & he never came back around. I'm a vegas local & originally from Chicago & the service & food quality the past few times have been awful! I work for a Caesars property & I will make sure to tell everyone not to go there. Plus they don't even care about there locals or Caesars employees. When I complained to the manager & things repeatedly went wrong, she said sorry & that was it!",

To top it all off when you try to let the managers know, they didn't want to hear it. They were very defensive and very rude. They were not willing to listen. I understand why you would protect your employees but take the time to listen to criticisms bec it can help better your business! Seriously!!!! RUDE RUDE RUDE and VERY RUDE!!!!!!!! Chicago has way better service! Go somewhere else!!!!!!!! Again check your checks!!!!!! DO NOT PAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD!!!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "What a fantastic taste of Chicago on the Las Vegas strip! Everyone who knows me knows how much I love the Chicago food scene, which features these deep dish works of art as its centerpiece. This one here on the strip is every bit as delicious as those back in Chicago and has an awesome view of the strip to boot!  We were promtly greeted and seated at about 10:00pm on a Friday night (and not coincidentally on National Pizza Day!). Our server was very friendly and smartly suggest we get our food order in with our drink order since the pies take 45 minutes to bake!   We went outside of the norm (I pretty much exclusively go with the meat meat and more meat), and tried the Small (6 slices) Chicago Classic, which is their take on a supreme style pizza. We enjoyed our cocktails while we waited and took in the great view of the Bellagio and the Bally's shopping area.   When the pizza arrived, we were all overjoyed. It looked and smelled incredible and the stringy cheese was sooo hypnotizing! It tasted even better than it looked with a wonderfully sweet yet perfectly acidic tomato sauce and incredibly tender veggies to include onion, mushrooms and green pepper.   We finished the meal with 3 delicious cannolis that had a light, crisp shell and a creamy, sweet ricotta filling. Just superb!   Overall, I highly recommend Gio's on the strip for a great evening out. You'll notice that it's a bit more expensive than those in Chicago, but it's worth every penny to be sure. 5 stars!",

To start we had cheese curds which were so amazingly good they can properly be described. The curds come with both Ranch and Marinara for dipping. The pizza I chose was the Meat and More Meat Deep Dish and it did not disappoint. The thick, rich flavors of the cheeses, meats and sauce all in that pie, surrounded by a crust that just cant be described with human words is out of this world. If you're in the area, which you probably are if you're in Vegas, make this pizza place a priority. Giordano's will be a new tradition ever time I visit.",

I'm typically really not particular at all with my food, as a matter of fact I almost always let the waiter order for me. Tonight all I wanted was a glass of water. I asked the waiter, and the person delivering the food for the waiter (who took our pizza to the wrong table, they said it wasn't theirs, I said it was mine, and he took it back to the kitchen anyway), and then asked the next person who brought the pizza back out for water. Long story short, no water... The pizza was great however, the atmosphere was lovely, views were amazing (watched the Bellagio water show while eating), and the wait to get in was fairly short. Just bring me a glass of water please",

Mines took almost 45 minutes from order to table.  This joint is located in front of Bally's, and there's actually an outdoor location. Which would have sucked on this 100 degree night. The indoor location is a nicer, albeit still loud atmosphere. But definitely more comfortable.  I ordered the special, which was a sausage mushroom concoction. When it finally came out, the pie smelled amazing. I took a slice and plopped it on my plate. Using a fork and knife, I cut through the thickness and tasted it. Niiiice. I mean, by this time, I had almost 30 oz of beer in my belly, so it wouldn't have taken much for me to eat what was put in front of me. The crust was nice and crunchy, while the inside was filled with pillowy soft mozzarella. There was a nice ratio of sausage and mushrooms too. But alas, it was so heavy, I could only finish 2 slices.  If you feel the hunkering for some deep dish, I'm sure this place will satisfy. Be prepared to wait and pay the higher prices. Don't hate me, but I think BJ's deep dish is just as good. hehe.",

She also suggested we order an app or salad. We ordered the mozzarella triangles and my fiance got a caesar  salad. The salad was so good (I always think salads are better when you don't have to make them!) and the mozzarella triangles were good too. Then... around 40 min later, the star of the show came out... the 'za! I ordered an individual pan pizza with pepperoni and green peppers. My fiance ordered a small pizza . They automatically have my stamp of approval because there was so much cheese! I don't have much experience with deep dish pizza, but if it's always like this.. then sign me up! I also saw that they ship their frozen pizzas so you can get your fix whenever you want. I will definitely stop back here when I'm back in Vegas!!",

    "text": "Stopped in to grab a bite to eat while on the strip.  I've had Giordanos many times in the past in Chicago.   We got there at 1145pm and quickly ordered.  We were told the wait time on a deep dish was 60 minutes and 35 miniature for a thin crust. We opted for a large thin crust because of the wait.    Feeling nostalgic for Chicago I also got a Italian beef sandwich with no cheese.   We ordered our dessert to go when we ordered our meal.    The Italian beef came out first.  First thing I notice is the huge glob of cheese when I had asked for no cheese. The sandwich came with a small side of Giardiniera and sweet peppers and small cup of au jus.  The sandwich was brought out by a guy in the kitchen. The waitress came by 5 mins later and asked if I liked the sandwich. I told her I had asked for no cheese and she said \"well I didn't put the cheese on it \". I assured her I knew that she hadn't put it on there (since she wasn't the cook).  The sandwich was good. Not very much beef and way too much cheese.  The Giardiniera was a tiny portion and I had to ask for more. The au jus had the right color but didn't seem to have much flavor.   The Italian beef looks nothing like the restaurant submitted photos on yelp.  The photo on here shows the bread full of beef. The sandwich I got had beef in the center and melted cheese over the top and on the sides.  No beef on the sides at all.   The garlic Parmesan fries were amazing. The best I've ever had.   The pizza came out. Wow what a cheese lovers paradise.  We ordered a pizza with four different toppings. They were very heavy with the green olives. Very little mushrooms and bell peppers. The ground beef was chewy and not very good.  Out of the large pizza we ate only three slices.   We asked for our food to be boxed up to go.   The waitress never boxed the rest of my sandwich.   And she forgot our dessert.   When she brought our boxed pizza I quickly noticed the box was too small for what we had left. I opened it up and saw that she has double stacked the whole pizza.  I asked her about this and she said that's the only box they had and that \"no other customers have problems with it\".   I had to stop and make sure I heard her right.  This is absolutely unacceptable.   She is by far one of the worst servers I've ever experienced.  She was defensive and unapologetic .  I told the manager and he removed the pizza from our bill.  He even took a picture of the pizza to show another manager.   The worst part was paying $9 parking at Bally's for this experience",

I wanted pepperoni, she wanted cheese, however we were told that they did not have any pepperoni made so we would have to wait 30 min.  We come back and guess what... they have pepperoni now and no cheese...oh my gosh the frustration!  I purchased the pepperoni in fear we would be doing this dance all day...another 30-40 min. my friend finally got her cheese pizza.  The pizza needed more flavor...certainly not worth the wait in my opinion.",

She forgot to bring our drinks, and then when she saw us she said shed bring them out. They brought the wrong salad out, then the right one later, pizza afterwards was about 50 minutes wait.  Ive heard great things about the pizza,  but it was honestly underwhelming for us. Not hot. She was friendly, maybe just overwhelmed by how many tables she had?? Im a local and probably won't return.  We were so excited to try this place out!  Grimaldi pizza is way better",

We brought our two year old along and they have a spot to keep strollers and overall is super kid friendly. The deep dish takes about 45 minutes but it is so worth the wait. They also gave my daughter so pizza dough to play with, which really kept her busy while we waited. This is my second time having deep dish and it is so good. Unlike any pizza I've ever had. Hopefully one day I can travel to Chicago and have a proper pie to compare this one to, but until then this will suffice.",

The place lies just below Ballys in the food court/bazar region, and has a nice location. The place was not too crowded, and noise level was perfectly normal. The music was awesome too, and they were playing a lot of classics from the 70s, 80s and 90s.  Our waiter was super nice and friendly, and helped us through the menu.  For starters we ordered one of their seasonal dishes; the pepperoni cheese fries. It was frickin amazing, and probably the best cheese fries I've ever had! Layers of cheese in between all the fried, garlic, and pepperoni on top. Delicious!  For the main course we got the meat and more meat deep dish pizza, and it was everything I expected it to be. The cheese pull, the huge amount of filling, the taste, the greasiness and the edges of the pizza. Everything was awesome! Highly recommended!",

The view is excellent, Yeah, pretty cool. What's even more impressive, the famous cheese pull.    Phone eats first, yeah, even at this joint Let me get to the details, I'll get to the point.  The pizza is cheesy, it's not a bust, The sauce is good, And WOW!  That crust!  The crust is flaky,  it's baked not fried. It's even good cold. I know, I tried.   I had three slices,  could eat eleven. I think I just died,  and went to pizza heaven.   So there you have it,  another rhyme. What time is it?

    "text": "The taste of the deep dish is seriously AMAZING. if you've never had deep dish, imagine lasagna and pie made into a doughy and decadent oven pizza.   We put our name in and they said it would be a 45 minute wait, but they called us in 20 minutes. We killed some time at Sin City brewery down the walkway in the meantime!  WARNING, this place is not only busy with a waitlist, but each of their pizza pies takes 25-45 minutes as they're made to order, from thin crust at 25 min to their famous deep dish being a whopping 45 minutes. As soon as you put your name down, definitely get your order ready to put in and hope you love talking with your dining group because it's going to be a very long wait. They've got a lot of beers on tap so that was great, and their appetizers are great to pass the time. Definitely recommend the deep fried mozzarella triangles!   As much as I love deep dish, I don't see myself returning here because I like spending as much time as I can on the Strip when I'm in Vegas. If you've got places to be and don't want to wait around for a meal, there's plenty of other choices that better suit your schedule! But otherwise, super solid choice for deep dish.",

Hostess greeted us and told us to wait by the front while she checked for table availability. We both looked out at the lights on the strip and didn't notice her waving menus at us to walk over to where she was standing. We walked over to our table and she dropped off our menus for us. A couple of servers had walked by back and forth tending to our tables and 10 minutes must've passed by before our server came over to us. We ordered a salad and small pizza to share which was way more than enough to satisfy our appetites. Our server was really friendly and tried to check up on us as often as she could. Just seemed like where the host sat us, we were a bit forgotten about compared to the other table that sat after us.",

We got a simple one with just spinach and pepperoni but it was honestly all we needed. There is just so much cheese in this pizza that any more than 2 or 3 toppings and I anticipate it would be too heavy. One meat and one veggie was just enough for us to be able to taste all the flavors of the pizza. I think my actual favorite part was the crust though. It was nice and crispy.  The only thing to be aware of is they make your pizza to order, so it can take about 45 minutes. You should plan on coming when you have plenty of time.   For someone like me who hasn't had much other deep dish Chicago style pizzas to compare to, I was pretty impressed.",

    "text": "I'm purely basing this review on the fact that this deep dish Chicago style pizza is AMAZING.   If you are as obsessed with cheese as I am, this is the place for you. The cheese pull on this pizza could stretch to the celling. And I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely believe that if you had arms long enough I think it would be possible.   The flavor is amazing. I personally love the Super Veggie and the Chicago Classic and obviously ask for like 10 sides of ranch. Obviously the star of the show is the filling, cheese and sauce. But, I think one of the best things about this particular deep dish is the crust. It's flakey, buttery, and almost like a pot pie crust. So fantastic.   If you do want to order a deep dish, be prepared to wait. It takes about 45 minutes to cook that thick bad boy. Totally worth it. The plus side is they have bomb salads and appetizers to chow down on while you wait for that cheesy, circle of heaven.  So happy you're here Giordanos. SO HAPPY.",

    "text": "Being from Illinois and experience a lot of different Chicago Pizza's, so when one of the more notable Chicago Pizza places opened up here in Vegas we had to make sure to give them a try.   The restaurant was nice and the bathrooms were clean which is a strong plus. The staff was amazing, our server made sure our drinks stayed full and checked in on us while we waiting for our order.  The Food: The Italian beef was good, my critique was the bread was not the authentic bread I am use to, and they toasted it which took from the sandwich I like my bread soft with a little chew to it. The meat and au jus was so flavorful it took the sandwich to another level.   The deep dish was by far one of the best we ever had, it was cooked to perfection and was full of flavor. It defiantly passes the cheese pull test when you lift your slice up from the pizza.   The only thing I was disappointed in with our whole meal experience was they brought out my husbands food while mine personal pizza was still cooking so b the time he was done eating about 10 mins later my pizza came out. I don't know about other dinners but I prefer to eat my meal with my husband instead of us watching each other eat.",

    "text": "Ahh, this brings back childhood memories.  Finally, one of two of my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza joints made its way to Vegas (the other being Lou Malnati's).   Located on the 2nd floor of the Bazaar Shops at Bally's, patrons can opt to eat inside in a nice cozy atmosphere with a bar area or downstairs outside where there were heaters to keep warm.    Inside, we were treated with great service all around.  It seemed like the staff kept vision of our table at all times with the corner of their eyes.  Every time we finished an appetizer, they came right over to clear the table for the next dish to come.  Water glasses were always filled as quickly as we drank them down.   Minestrone soup for starters was hot and hearty and it was a nice intro to what would be a delicious dinner.  Even my daughter's chicken fingers for some reason tasted better than the average chicken finger.   Of course, we came for the pizza.  This is not going to be your quick sit down, eat, and go restaurant.  From time of ordering, the server will tell you it takes about 45 minutes to make your pie.   It certainly isn't quick but it certainly is worth the wait.  Double flaky light crust, thick gooey melted cheese followed with all the toppings and pizza sauce on top.  As our server served out each pre-cut slice of pie to our plates, the signature cheese stretching from the pan  just makes your mouth water as you prepare to take your first bite.    The pie is so thick, make sure you're using your fork and knife for this one!  You can't really go wrong with any of the pies here.  If you love meat, the \"Meat & More Meat\" will be your best bet.   Pepperoni, sausage, salami, and bacon will keep your carnivorous self content.  If you so happen to desire to sway from the norm, salads, pastas, and Italian beef sandwiches round out the menu.  Overall, a nice experience, hardly crowded, plenty of food, reasonable prices, great service, full stomachs.  Welcome to Vegas, Chicago.  Your food is always welcome here.",

    "text": "Formerly from the Chicago area I couldn't wait for this place to be open! Based on multiple visits to Giordano's in the past my expectations were pretty high for this new addition to Vegas. There is a downstairs bar area outside and an enclosed upstairs bar/ restaurant area.   We sat at the bar upstairs to eat. Great views of the fountains at Bellagio! Service was good the entire time. Ordered a small Greek salad to start with & they also gave us a FREE order of wings to try. Both were really good. Had to get both deep dish & thin crust pizza so we ordered a deep dish spinach for there & a par baked spinach tomato to go. A chef even came out of the kitchen to tell us how to cook our par baked pizza for later. Deep dish was great! Just like Chicago. We made our pizza the next day.  Fabulous! Thin & crispy. No limp New York crust.   Side note: if you encounter any bad employees don't worry, they'll get rid of them   Bad attitudes don't last in Vegas!!",

Seriously though... when has a hostess ever recommended their favs? Most just seat you and tell you your server will be right with you.   The house salad dressing is a tasty and the damn tomatoes are also juicy af!   Best bruschetta eeeeeevvvvveeer! And I've tried many!",

    "text": "Giordano's is one of our favorite restaurants to eat at when visiting Chicago so we were pleased to see that it had made its way to the Las Vegas Strip. While in town for NYE, we figured it was only appropriate to have it as our last meal of 2016. Our strategy was to eat here for an early dinner and have the leftovers for a late-night hangover snack (thinking ahead ).  We ordered our staple, The Chicago Special with added sausage, and also decided to try The Sample as an appetizer.  The garlic cheese bread on The Sampler was delicious as well as the loaded potatoes bites. Of course, our pizza was tasty. I always recommend adding giardiniera if you want an extra kick of flavor! The couple next to us saw us order it on the side and decided to try it themselves... they became instant fans!  The staff here was extremely friendly and our server, Leon, was great and accommodated everything we needed. I was also happy to see that this location didn't price gouge simply because they're in the heart of The Strip... everything was on par with what you'd pay at any of the other locations. They have two dining areas - one on the promenade and then the main restaurant.  I recommend dining in the main restaurant as it has an amazing view which is great for dinner.  We also noticed that there are retractable doors towards the back which I'm sure will make for great patio-style dining in the warmer months.  All in all, we were very pleased with our experience at Giordano's LV and will likely add this to our \"Go-To Dining When We Don't Feel Like Figuring It Out\" list.",

We had a great waiter, Craig, who was nice and knowledgeable about the place. The director of operations, Michael, was very friendly as well and talked to us about the water filtration proceeds in establishing this restaurant. I would highly recommend this place.",

Be warned: for those that have never had deep dish, understand that it takes about 45 minutes or so for it to cook. We ordered appetizers such as the bruschetta and the fried mozzarella as we waited. I had the veggie deep dish, and I was not disappointed. The crust was cooked through and had a bit of a crunch, and the pizza was the right amount of cheesiness. The restaurant is kind of small, so be sure to come early to avoid a long wait time!",

The flavors just weren't there. The service at this location wasn't great. We were seated next to the kitchen and saw everything that was going on. Since the location is small, the pizza is not made in the tiny kitchen that we were sitting next to. I will be passing on this location and picking someone closer to me when I'm craving a pizza.",

    "text": "My most recent visit to Giordano's Las Vegas (located on the Bally's promenade) was truly fabulous.  The decor feels next to nothing like Las Vegas, which I think is a compliment. You feel as if you're in a charming Chicago suburb with a view that just happens to overlook the strip.   Every member of the staff couldn't have been more friendly, attentive and helpful. The Owner, Michael, is literally one of the most impressive Owners/Restaurant Managers I have come across as a diner. His passion for Giordano's and for taking care of guests is unparalleled. I used to work in restaurants and I have never come across a gem quite like him.  But, I digress, let's get to the food!  Our server and Michael recommended some appetizers for us and helped us choose a few salads that were Giordano's signatures. To me, salads are the perfect appetizer when one is about to tackle a deliciously dense stuffed pie as an entree later. We ordered the Chopped, the House and the Italiano and all of them were a unique experience. And, as explained by our waiter, all of them complimented their pizza in their own way.  Speaking of Pizza, we ordered a deep dish stuffed pie with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms and it was truly a symphony. Their sauce has a hint of sweet, with just enough spice and tang to play off of the mild flavors of the caverns of mozzarella that lie beneath. And the crust; that crust! It is flavorful and the perfect combination of soft and crispy in addition to somehow functioning as a mold for keeping the mountain of toppings in place.   For dessert, we split a tiramisu that was fresh, moist and good all over alongside a surprisingly good cup of coffee.  I can't say enough good things about the food and the service. I'll be back many, many times.  Giordano's Las Vegas, you are a star.",

Pizza Hut or Papa John's taste way better and takes a fraction of the time. We ordered a deep dish mushrooms small pizza which cost $22 after-tax. First the crust is god awful. It's flaky and dry and falls apart simply by touching it. Tasted like dry cardboard. Second the cheese has no taste whatsoever. Third tomato sauce is bitter with very little seasoning. Fourth we got mushrooms as our topping and there were not nearly enough! Don't go here!!",

Many people came in after us, ate, and left before we ever got our 1 large pizza we ordered. We waited 1.5 hours for a pizza we never received. About an hour in, the waitress said our food would arrive in \"about 5 minutes\" and 30 mins later it wasn't there. I'm pretty sure they forgot about our order or misplaced our order slip and didn't realize. With only 1 night in Vegas during a road trip we didn't feel we wanted to waste any more time, and we left really hungry. We found another by the slice pizza place and got our pizza in under 5 mins. I will not return here, unfortunately. It sucks because the deep dishes looked delicious.",

I love the deep dish pizza here and tried a variety of toppings and they have ALL been delicious. 1-2 slices is enough for me as it's VERY filling! We've also tried the caesar salad, the lasagna, and the chicken wings on separate occasions and they were all delicious. Everyone we've taken here has loved it! The location is so convenient and easy to walk to if you're staying on the Strip. I also did to-go here last time, and the lady that rang me up was so sweet and she called me when the pizza was ready so I could go and shop/gamble and do other things while the pizza cooked. Pizza does take about 30-45 minutes, just FYI! Will visit again very soon!",

Thankfully, the food we ordered saved this review. We started off with the family-size Caesar salad, as well as the potato fritters. I would highly recommend the fritters as they held us over until our pizzas arrived. We ordered The Special and Cheese deep-dish, both of which came out hot and in a somewhat timely manner.

Mostly because we were sick of walking and my cousin recognized it from Chicago.   The place was pretty empty but we realized it was because people preferred to sit in the downstairs patio area, which we probably should have done for the experience.   WHAT WE ORDERED:   Italian beef sandwich - had good flavor but was a bit salty for my taste  Margherita pizza - we didn't realize this was under the thin and crispy crust. I didn't mind it but everyone else didn't like that it was crispy and flakey like a cracker.  The Chicago classic deep dish - delicious! Ooey gooey and oh so cheesey!  Fettuccine alfredo - sounds like the most basic thing we ordered but it was actually the best dish! It was HUGE for starters. We liked that the pasta actually tasted like there was cheese. I hate it when Fettuccine just tastes like pasta mixed in cream.  I don't know if it was because this place just opened and they still have some kinks to work out, but our order took ridiculously long to come out. Well over an hour! Possibly even an hour and a half. We were pretty agitated but the staff did apologize for the unexpected super long wait. Our waiter was great! It wasn't his fault that our food took so long.",

The self park to restaurant hike is a pain.  It's worth the trip though to get the real deal, but that includes the real wait time. For us on the second visit it was a solid 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive. The couple next to us looked like they were really suffering with an empty table for so long. Hint: eat your salad or appetizer very sloooowly...  Also note that if you eat in the main indoor dining room it is very loud. There is no place for sounds to be absorbed given the concrete floors, absence of window treatments, etc.   But those things aside, the pizza is heavenly, with an excellent crust that you can happily finish off even if there is no sauce on it. Flakey, buttery goodness. Servers have been friendly, helpful and brought refills of soda without being asked. The kids dig it so we will be back a lot.",

    "text": "Wanted to go to Amore Taste of Chicago for my first ever deep dish pizza but it is quite out of the way. This place was on the strip and had pretty good reviews so we went here instead.  First off, i am not a pizza person. Anytime i get pizza i scrape the toppings off after the first bite haha. But for vacations, I make sure I eat as much of everything in the meal as I can. The first piece of this pizza was amazing. It was stuffed, it was super cheesy and I love my cheese! But by the time I got to my second piece, it wAs already droopy, soggy, and pretty much mushy aside from the crust. The cheese was already hardened too so it wasn't stringy anymore. BF thinks its the air of the restaurants in Vegas since this wasn't the only place the food got cold.. FAST.   Overall, I'm glad we didn't make a journey to the other one i originally wanted to go to. This first piece, like i said was satisfying. The main thing i did like was that the crust was quite thin so you do get that load of pizza filling and cheese. The bad part, like i said, is unless you are inhaling each piece, once it gets cold, the \"hype\" is pretty much gone.   The staff was terrible too. At least our waiter was. We weren't even finished eating and he already gave us the bill. When he came with the machine, he didn't even bother asking us the most generic question, \"how was everything?\". However, if you have never tried a deep dish pizza and are not planning to go to chicago anytime soon, i guess it is still worth trying since it is on the strip!",

Nice thing about Vegas is there are many nice places open to 2 AM or all night.  The appetizer is to die for.  So good.  Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same for their pizza.  Which is so-so.  Now their specialty is the deep dish pizzas but it takes 1 hour to bake so we opted for thin crust Chicago style pizza.  It was decent.  Nothing to write home about.",

Our waiter was great.  Super knowledgeable about the menu and sent us off with to-go cups for our drinks on the way out.    The deep dish pizza takes a little longer to bake (35-45 minutes), but it's totally worth it.  The pizza is delicious.  They offer, small, medium and large pizzas for roughly $25 - $35 deep dish and $21 - $32 thin crust.  We did deep dish half Chicago Classic (Pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers & onions) and half Spinach, Artichoke, Feta.  Both were delicious and even better the next day.  The tomato sauce and flavor is great.  Pizza is super fresh and the crust is great.",

The menu and the waiter both mentioned a 45 minute wait (from ordering) for any deep dish.  We were ok with it.  Pizza came out about the 55 minute mark so no complaints there.  As far as food goes, they were out of the cheesy bread so couldn't try those, had the mozzarella sticks and calamari while we waited.  Both were fine, nothing fabulous, nothing terrible.  Kind of in the middle.   We shared a Meat meat and more meat deep dish.  It looked delicious.  The taste was good...again, kind of in the middle. Not amazing, not bad.  I can't say that I've had True (in Chicago) style deep dish, so as far as composition of the pie goes, I can only say I like crust that has some chew to it.  I prefer a good ratio of ingredients to sauce to crust.  For this pie, the meats all had good flavor, the sauce was good, the crust was a bit crunchy...but I think all in all was a bit too much for me.   This probably solidified for me that I prefer NY style to Chicago style.  I'm sure if you prefer deep dish this is great, however for me the 45 min wait isn't worth mediocrity.  Not with so many other options out there.",

We asked our server if we could move to a booth and were told No . He informed us they were for bigger parties.. (Are you kidding me  what happened to customer service? ).. our pizza finally showed up it was warm at best. I wonder if they use a temp prob to check if the meats are cooked all the way ? The server came by to check on us and I mentioned that the pizza was warm and not hot , he took the pizza to the back and when he returned it was burnt.. but at least it was hot. .. If you're looking for great pizza I wouldn't come here, it's good at best. Customer service is not that important to this restaurant.",

They don't take reservations so are a very late dinner.  Part of our party went earlier to get a table so they were also able to order the pizza since it takes about 45 minutes.   If you haven't had deep dish pizza before it's very very filling so if you normally eat 3 slices of thin crust you might just get filled up with one slice.     We parked at Paris and it's kinda a long walk from the parking garage to the restaurant which is located in the grand shoppes at Bally's.",

Each one is unique with their toppings.. 12:20 PM - We arrive at the pick up window for our order.

The personal sized 6' Famous Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza is very filling considering it's size and is just over 1,200 calories. (per their website)  There's only 4 thick slices, and it's very cheesey af (like me) and extremely tasty.  The ingredients are high quality and the preparation is on point.

Waiting line is about 5-10mins. We we're seated by the window overlooking the city. We ordered Garlic Parmesan Fries, Lasagna with a house made marinara sauce and a small special deep dish pizza. Server told us that it will took 45minutes to 1 hour for the food to arrive due to the style of the pizza.  Food came out hot, fresh and cheesy. It was all good we finished everything except the deep dish, I can only eat 1 slice (So stuffed already). Great Service, Yummy pizza and Good location. You can also order online and pick it up on the window (not sure if they deliver). Happy hour is weekdays from 3-6pm.",

    "text": "First time here.  We ate at the indoor portion of the restaurant.  As we were seated the waitress let us know there would be a 45 min wait for deep dish pizza.  That's what we came for so we waited.  Just about exactly 45 min our pizza came out just as expected.  The small meat and more meat was more than enough for myself and my husband, we were left with 2 slices to take.  Lots of cheese!!  We also had an order of the jalapeno lime wings and the flavor was ok(hubby's choice), would have liked to try the reg buffalo but I was there for pizza LOL.  Waiter was nice and kept my soda filled before I even finished the last one.  We arrived just before 5 and got a seat promptly.  The line was long on our way out at about 6:15 so we got there at just the right time to not have to wait.  Would go back again for sure when in Vegas!",

We were so hungry so we ordered their sampler and it was delicious. Their sangria was a basic tasting but helped passed time while we waited for our pizza. All I can say is the pizza was worth the wait. It was cheesy and full of flavor. Definitely a go to when visiting the strip!",

Got the sampler which was pretty good came with brushetta, mozarella sticks, pizza bread? And chicken which we got ranch and buffalo sauce for. Was perfect for 4 girls the brushetta tasted fresh and refreshing! Onto the pizza itself we got the chicago classic which had pepperoni, mushroom, onion and green peppers in it. It was between that and meat lovers but we chose the classic. PIZZA TAKES 45min so order that quick if you are deciding on appetizers. We were starving and it was satisfying. The toppings were inside the pizza not on top which was an interesting surprise. It was good not the best pizza i've had but i may be bias to nyc pizza thin crust. The thick crust wasn't bad but maybe the toppings itself didn't seem as hot and cooked to me idk?  Was sad they had a deal on appetizers too because of HH or something but u could only eat it if you sat at the bar. Fairly big venue we sat inside on the top floor of the restaurant they have another on the first floor of the little store strip. Huge windows we had to ask to put the shade down because the sun was blinding.",

To-go or dine-in is amazing. Currently there's no delivery. Parking is kind of a pain but the pizza makes it worth it.   If you've never had stuffed pizza, go for it. This is different than deep dish. Try the stuffed with spinach if you want one that's more \"heart healthy\" or go with our fave, double pepperoni and double onion.    We took ours to-go and the service was great.   Everything is fresh and tastes, well, no words to describe the taste. Have fun and come hungry.",

    "text": "Hubby and I have been big fans of this chain ever since visiting one on our way between MI and MO. We love to share a small, meat-filled deep-dish Pizza and eat the whole thing by ourselves. I think the dough is perfect - very buttery and almost flaky, never burnt or crispy. It's absolutely FILLED with sauce, toppings and, most importantly, CHEESE.   The only downside to deep dish? A very long wait. You might wait for a table if it's busy. Then wait to order because people can't decide what to order. Then you wait about thirty minutes for your pizza to cook. So imagine my husband's happiness when I informed him that this location has person size deep-dish Pizza to-go. No waiting. They ready before you even place your order. Perfect.   Personally, I really prefer the full Size pizzas because I feel they have a better relation of dough to fillings. But it's nice that this location can get be you either depending on what you want.   I've also tried a couple thin crust pizzas. The BBQ Chicken definitely stood out and I would absolutely order it again!  This place really does have friendly and helpful service. Stop by!",

It's beautiful and attached to Bally's . Free WiFi with an outside sports bar. Right off the strip but hidden and not too busy.  The sampler was surprisingly high quality too. Oh, real parm cheese in their table shakers! Not that fake dried stuff . A nice touch !",

    "text": "Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever received at a restaurant.   Brought several visitors from out of the country that were here for a sporting championship; as happens when organizing 10 out of towners to meet in a foreign country, we started with 5 that showed up on time.   We only took up a 5 top. We ordered pizza and several pitchers of drinks while waiting for the rest to arrive.   Once they did, we asked if we could join an adjacent empty 5 top to our table to accommodate the new guests.   We were told by the hostess that we had been there two hours already and were messing up her wait times. I didn't think that was right for her to say, so I went to the manager on duty.   He reiterated what the hostess said and told me we had been there two hours already and were messing up his quote times.   This is after the 5 of us (on a 5 top) had been ordering the whole time we were there.   I asked for the bill immediately; he said \"fine\". It then took 30 minutes for them to produce the bill and process 3 payments. All the while now 10 of us were standing around the table, waiting to leave. There were 9 empty tables in the restaurant by the time we left. We went downstairs to Wahlburger and spent another $500.   Absolutely appalling service displayed by Giordanos. I'm local, and in the industry.   I will be telling EVERYONE I know that they should steer clear of the place, unless they want to be put on a timer.",

    "text": "My friend highly recommended this place because she had tried it in Chicago and loved it so we decided to have dinner here. The patio outside doesn't seat parties of 5 so we had to go to the indoor seating. We arrived at 7pm. The hostess quoted us for a 30 to 40 minute wait. We put a name and number down and pre ordered the pizza once we figured out what we wanted: deep dish chicken bacon bbq. While my friend was pre ordering the pizza,  I noticed a couple come up and put their name down for a party of 11 and a pre order. After 10 minutes,  we received a text at 7:20 saying our wait time was bumped up to 60 to 70 minutes. Then a minute later we got another text saying our table was ready. We were seated and told the waiter that we had a pre order already and he went to check on it.    At 8:15, the table of 11 received their 3 pizzas before us. A table of 4 that sat after us as well received their pizzas as well.  We didn't receive our pizza until 8:40. When we asked the waiter why our pizza took so much longer than normal even after we preordered and came before the other tables, he gave us a half assed  answer saying they preordered and he doesn't know how the system works up there. The waiter noticed that the party of 11 got their pizzas first and tried to assure is ours would come soon. He kept dodging our table and would go around even though we were seated next to the kitchen. After we questioned him on the pizza time,  he stopped asking us how we were doing.  If the waiter or the hostess messed up on our order it would be understandable but they didn't tell us about it and tried to half ass a response instead of fixing it. The service sucks.  The food is good. I understand it takes time to cook fresh pizza but when you have to wait over an hour for food and see tables that were seated after you and they get their pizzas first,  then the taste of the pizza isn't really that worth it. My friends enjoyed the pizza because they were so damn hungry but I couldn't stop being irritated at the lack of etiquette and respect for the consumer.   Again,  food is good. But our experience here for the first time was terrible.",

They actually have 2 locations which was kind of a surprise:  one in the center of the Bazaar that is covered & have plenty of fans, but they consider it outdoor seating, & one at the top of the escalators behind the Giordano's sign, which is indoors.  The host & our server emphasized to us that a deep dish would take 30-45 minutes.  But our server, Carolina, would not give us a chance to look over the menu!  The restaurant was not busy, this was our first time dining with them, we did not know what we wanted, but I kid you not, she came by 4 times within 5 minutes asking if we were ready.  The Special (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions):  A small (6 slices) were plenty for the 2 of us.  Get your fork & knife ready because it is definitely a hearty meal!

I first fell in love with Gino's East in Chicago, now Giordano's hold the number two spot in my heart!!   We arrived during lunch hour, there were six of us. Sadly the AC wasn't working, the hostess asked if we preferred to dine downstairs where it was cooler. Everyone declined due to the 30min wait time. So we stayed upstairs, My husband and I didn't mind the warmer temperature...side note! My apologies to the staff! Two of our cousins made rude comments about the AC....These southern idiots could've went downstairs, but decided to complain. Classic ignorance...  Food:  Everyone knows a Chicago deep dish takes 30-40mins to order. We selected two Large deep dish pizzas the \"Meat & More Meat\" and the \"Classic Chicago\". Talk about perfection!!! We had PLENTY of leftovers! To my surprise the Pizza was even better the second day! My favorite part was the crust! Still dreaming about it! Thank you  Giordano's!",

The pizza was cold and tasted nothing like cheese or sauce. The lasagna.... well let's just say stouffers heated up in the microwave tastes better that whatever I was served. My friend ordered spaghetti. How does one fuck up spaghetti??? But it was done y'all. The meat sauce was dark brown and had either absolutely no flavor or someone screwed up in the kitchen.

Our waiter has an Italian accent told us about the pizza and it would take about 45 minutes to cook. Since our time was limited we decided to just order appetizer sampler plate. Well that is it got started, he rolled his eyes like he worked getting commission on how many pizza he sold.First he brought us Diet Coke or Pepsi and was never to be seen. Finally we saw him ask for another glass of soda he said Pepsi said yes regular Pepsi again he brought another diet. After we ate our food he started to pick up the plates slamming them together and throwing the silverware on to the plates. When we ask for the check he just slammed the little machine on the table and walk away to the table next to us . I just swiped my card grabbed the receipt and walk away, then as we where leaving he turn around and pick up the machine. Wish we would of not left any tip. The one star is for the rude service he gave us not the food which was great. If you go there stay away from this server extremely rude if you don't order pizza.",

    "text": "One word describes Giordanos well: Mediocre. It's not significantly expensive enough to warrant anything but the food is pretty mediocre and bland. Setting-wise it's fairly scenic. It's placed in the middle of a complex of small variety shops. What doesn't work, however, is the greenhouse area. It gets intensely warm in the greenhouse so I would highly suggest eating inside. Apparently Giordanos is known for their deep dish pizza but if you plan on buying it prepare yourself for a 45 minute to an hour wait. It wasn't even worth the wait. All I received was a bland mash. The salad was pretty good but everything else like the meatballs and the thin crust pizza are just okay; not anything exciting or good enough.   I would not recommend this to friends or family but if you have many enemies then this is your place.",

We started off with Giordano's Sampler which comes with wings, cheesy garlic bread, mozzarella triangles and loaded potato fritters. The cheesy garlic bread was to die for, in my opinion, and my favorite thing I had during our whole meal!   We ordered 2 deep dish pizzas, the Chicago Classic and Meat and More Meat. Personally, I love veggies so I preferred the Chicago Classic. If you love cheese, these pizzas are definitely for you! You won't be disappointed with the TV-like stringy cheese action when you pull the slices apart. Only downside is how long these babies take to cook. Our waitress did let us know it would take about 45 minutes for them to bake. So I definitely suggest ordering an appetizer to hold you over while you wait.   I am not the biggest fan of deep dish pizzas in the first place, but if heaps of sauce, cheese and toppings are your thing, I'm sure you'll enjoy this place.",

Overall, if they don't mess up your order and learn how to calculate a bill correctly, I'd recommend this place.  UPDATE: The owner of the restaurant contacted me and actually apologized that there was the slip in service. I was very surprised by the integrity and attitude of the owner of the restaurant! Because of this I will go back and try it again. There is something to be said for people who run their businesses like that and who are willing to make things right for the customer. Just based on that alone I recommend going here.",

The Chicago style deep dish pizza I ordered was the \"meat and more meat.\" It was unlike any pizza I have had before, and that is the primary reason why I gave this place a chance on Christmas day. The bruschetta was recommended by Sarah as an appetizer and was delicious way to start.

Even though they're very well know for their deep-dish pizza, it takes about 45 minutes to make and the server tells you this right away. That's just nice that they do that and not letting you find out how long it would take to get their signature dish. But everything else we got on the menu was DELICIOUS!  I got the meatball sub the first night, and the starter platter (which had a great variety of choice to eat from). And my mom got the salads both times and loved the presentation and flavor of the two different kinds of greens. The service was so friendly and courteous, and I wish there was Giordanos in Cleveland because sauce in my meals was amazing and unforgettable. Also, just ignore of the other customers that come there and aren't as grateful for their yummy meals. I'd recommend the outdoor bar to hang out with your friends and enjoy Giordanos brilliant starters & entrees!",

    "text": "We had lunch here today. We were seated for about 8 minutes or so before our server arrived to take our drink order. He was extremely busy and was moving as fast as he could so I don't fault him . I felt the drinks took a significant amount of time to arrive as well, but perhaps this is simply due to the initial wait. Our pizza was served and when we grabbed the stack of plates that was on the table, 3 out of four were noticeably dirty. There was actually like a blob of marinara stuck to one of them. Our server was very apologetic and replaced them immediately. The meal itself was delicious. We had pizza and a chicken Parmesan sandwich. I would return to give it another shot because the food was good and the server (Jesus I believe) was very friendly. If I had the same experience with the wait or dirty utensils, I would understand that this is the way they staff their restaurant and would choose not to return. All in all, it was an ok experience.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for business and in the mood for Chicago Pizza, but did not see any good options on Yelp.  While driving back to my hotel, I saw out of the corner of my eye a Giordano's sign in front of Bally's.  I was ecstatic and did a quick u-turn and parked at Bally's.  When I arrived at Giordanos, the hostess informed me they had opened just the day before.  Because of this I expected poor service.  I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the pizza was what I expected - AMAZING!!!!!   I got the garlic cheese bread to help get me through the 45 min wait for my pizza.  I fully expected the pizza to take this long and was actually happy to hear about the wait.  As a transplanted Chicagoian who travels a fair amount for business, I am always on the lookout for REAL Chicago pizza.  I make a habit of calling ahead and ask how long it takes to cook the pizza.  If they tell me anything less than 45 min, I hang up and look for other dinner options.  When the pizza arrived, it was well worth the wait!!!!!!  While there I learned they have a pickup window at street level.  Good  to know that is an option.",

I was a bit nervous to try this location figuring it wouldn't live up to its flagship, but it did a pretty good job.  Prices were fair and the atmosphere was great.  From the bar and some tables, you have a view of Bellagio's fountains.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.  Consistently re-filled my drink, don't think it ever fell below half empty.  They do tell you upfront that the pizzas typically take 35-45 minutes.  Around the 30 minute mark, the bartender was apologetic and assured me it would be out soon.  As we approached 45, he once again apologized and said his manager could offer an appetizer while I waited.  Though I declined, I really appreciated the gesture.  Knowing how long the pizzas take from previous experiences, I wasn't aggravated by the wait time.  Around 50 minutes, my pizza came out, and yes it was worth the wait.  Would definitely visit again.",

With that said, please remember that it takes about 45 minutes or more to cook the pizza because it is made right after you order to get the freshest pizza possible. This is a great place to go if you have the patience to wait for the pizza.  I don't recommend this to anyone that is starving and would like the food now. If you get cranky waiting for food to be cooked then this isn't the place for you. You literally have to wait a while for the pizza to come out. It's worth it if you have the patience to wait. If not... go somewhere else!",

    "text": "I don't normally write yelp reviews, but this had me and my party of 8 upset and unsatisfied. Waitress told us that the deep dish pizza would take 45 mins and we said okay we will wait. Appetizer came out first at adequate time. Got calamari and was good! The complaint lies in the timing of dishes served and quality of the entrees. The refill people were really attentive and came by multiple times. The deep dish pizza came out FIRST (when it's the thing that is supposed to take the longest) around the 45 min mark. The timing was expected, but to have the dish we got warned about the timing to come out FIRST? That's odd....the rest of us ordered sandwiches, pasta, and the pot pie thing and waited a good 5-10 mins after the pizza came. The pasta was UNDERCOOKED, cold, and some were really hard. We ate it anyways because we were starving from waiting so long and we had already waited a long time for our food and didn't want to wait for a replacement if that was an option. We complained and the waitress and she spoke to her manager. When we got the check we got a 10% discount on all the pasta dishes!  Better than nothing I guess, but what a joke to wait so long for pasta and sandwiches only to have it cold and hard and receive a measly 10% discount. I can't say anything about the quality of the sandwiches bc I did not try it, but it definitely shouldn't be one of the last things out esp. when we were warned about another dish. The pot pie was dry, but the parmesan fries were good . If you come here expect long waits and definitely just order pizza. The deep dish was alright; I'd rate it a 3/5....i've had better",

He assured it wouldn't take long. Fast forward 25 minutes. The waiter comes back and apologizes for the wait, but assures us food is on the way and we would receive compensation on the bill. Great! We waited some more and our waiter is no where to be seen. I flag down a host and she radios the waiter who assures her that food is on the way. I was really hoping the next time I saw the waiter he would be bringing food- nope- he brought the manager to apologize and gift cards. Seriously? You think I want to be back??? If he had walked up with food, the it would have been annoying but I would have been ok.  What is so difficult about a salad, cheese bread,and a sandwich that would take over 40 minutes?  No thank you.",

    "text": "is there a lower rating than 1?!  When we asked our server the recommendation. He insisted that we get the thin crust pizza. He claimed that even though their specialty is the deep dish, it will take as long as an hour and half.  We then order an entree of Fetucini pasta and a small home style hand stretched  Chicken and sausage pizza. 30 minutes had passed and we asked the same waiter if they forgot our pizza - he replied with it is coming bc deep dish takes that long.. I then said we didnt order deep dish, and his next response is \"oh yes.. of course, let me double check\".  which sounded and felt sarcastic. Another 15mins had passed so we decided to ask another waiter, and he came back with stating there were no order placed... he called out the 6 feet tall mohawk dbag of a waiter to come to our table to confirm and  he responded with \"I'm not the one who's serving them.\" My friend and I and the other waiter had this blank stare looking at each other bc clearly this dbag is handling our section. Even the couple next to us commented and started chuckling. Another 10 minutes had passed... and there comes the pizza!! A THIN CRUST pepperoni pizza!  I was fed up so I asked for the check. The charge was the hand stretched pizza we had order. When I asked the waiter to give us the menus so I could compare the price, the manager came over and apologize for her staff's behavior.  I told her what had happened and she decided to waive the pizza cost. After I signed the check. Our dbag of a server came and try to \"apologize\" stating that (get this): He did made the order but the kitchen burned the pizza, and never made a second one. It's the kitcken fault not his.  He then again insisted that we should try the thin crust and boxed our pizza to go. Fearing to whether he may or may not spit on it.. We placed on top of the garbage bin outside - in case there are any homeless looking for food. To think of it: we stormed out of the place pissed.. But I should had reconfirm with the kitchen staff.. about our waiter's innocense. I do wonder how would they feel when they find out that this waiter is blaming them for something they have never done. Maybe the restaurant is decent? and We only had a bad experience bc of this individual. So if you really have to go here. I recommend if he became your server, just request for another one, and if you don't which one is him. Just show this comment to the manager, she will know. When she was apologizing to us last night. she had this look: rolling eyes and a long sigh.. of a disappointment.. clearly this is not the first or will be the last from him. Happy eating",

He recommended perfect beer and appetizer pairings. We got a salad and bruschetta with a pitcher of a light ale. We got a large deep dish pizza the Chicago style and it took a very long time.. A little over an hour to get to our table whereas we were told 45mins. But Patrick kept us updated and entertained the whole time.. They were very busy so it's understandable. I would definitely go back!!",

We also ordered a deep dish with pepperoni and green bell pepper and that too was mediocre. Honestly I have had better pizza from Pizza hut. Now don't get me wrong I loved when I was in Chicago and ate at the original but this one was a sad attempt. On a good note the potato bites were tasty.",

We also had the opportunity to try The thin crust artichoke pizza. Homerun! I had the same flavors as their salad and was a nice refreshing starter before the meat pizza came Chicago style.  Miranda the manager was so nice and even took us into the kitchen for a tour. It was busy and we got to see their systems and how they organize and by the way their ovens are amazing. I can say that if you're coming to Vegas there's a lot to eat a lot of great pizza and Giordano's is definitely one to try. They care about their customers and the customer experience. Thank you so much to Miranda Patrick and Michael.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in here last weekend 8/20/18 before seeing a show at the Mirage. The service staff was friendly enough even though it was 107 degrees. We ordered the Meat and more meat pizza and our pizza came out faster than we expected and there was a good reason for that. The crust was undercooked, soggy and almost impossible to eat. When we complained about the quality of our pizza our server said it would take an hour to make a new one and then offered to box our pizza up so we could take it home. We left more than half of it sitting on the table, paid our bill and even left a 20% tip but we wont be back even tho we heard good things about the pizza we are from Seattle and that would just not fly up here. We love Las Vegas and will be back but not to eat at Giordanos that's for sure.",

The food came out amazing and surpassed my expectations. The pizza's crust and filling were delicious and because my date and I treated ourselves to the calamari and the potato fritters, we couldn't finish the pizza. No worries at all since we now have some awesome leftovers for later! We also had some amazing salad and topped it off with an equally amazing Tiramisu!! Giordano's is definitely my choice for Chicago style pizza here in Vegas!!! Don't pass it up!!",

    "text": "Giordano's is my favorite Chicago pizzeria and it's taken me far too long to visit the Vegas location.  It's hard to explain what makes this pizza so damn delicious - it's very different from \"normal\" pizza. It's got super thick, buttery crust and tons of cheese. It's basically stuffed pizza, because only the tomato sauce is on top. My absolute favorite is the spinach pie, which I originally tried in Chicago. We recently met my hubby's Aunt for dinner while she was in town for a conference and we decided to share a salad and a custom pizza. We basically wanted all meat and veggies and we got what we asked for.  This is a busy place and the pizza takes time to cook, so be ready! They have a decent beer selection, with even a couple of local taps. The service was friendly and it was semi-baby friendly. I say semi because we were seated upstairs and the baby blocked an aisle because the tables were close together. It's also pretty loud, so if you have a child and they are sensitive to noise, I might say to avoid this place. Luckily, our kid sleeps better the louder it is, so we didn't have any problems.  I wish that Giordano's built locally, rather than on the Strip. But I get it - unfortunately, it just means we won't visit often. It's such a hassle to deal with parking at Bally's, especially now that they are charging (although it's currently still free for locals). We had to walk quite a distance to get to the Bazaar Shops and this restaurant.",

I told him that I had ordered a personal size, he quickly took away the pizza and told me that there was no such thing as a personal deep dish pizza (although the menu only offers personal pizzas that are deep dish).    My friend offered to share her pizza with me.  The manager came to our table and told us we didn't have to worry about paying for the pizza I didn't receive she had taken it off the check.

    "text": "I told my coworkers that I've never had deep dish pizza before. After their jaws dropped, they said that tomorrow's lunch will be from Giordanos. So I yelped them (of course). I saw they offered 10% off any online orders. PERFECT! So as the assistant in my office I proceeded to take the individual orders from 8 different people. All 8 of us ordered 6 inch individual deep dish pizzas with all different toppings.   Placing the order online not only was easy but it gave me the total price of each person. So placed my order at 11:30 and asked for a 12:20 pick up.  The pick up: 3/5 If your doing a pick up, parking is easy but not convenient AT ALL. I parked in the Paris's parking garage. First 30 minutes was free! We walked through half of Paris to get outside to the promenade. Please note there is a pick up window next to starbucks so don't waste your time going to the main restaurant.  Once I finally arrived at the pick up window I paid and the were finishing up the pizzas. By 12:35 I had all 8 pizzas in hand and walking back to my car.  Taste: 5/5 By the time we got back to our office the pizzas were slightly cooled and ready to eat! Once I bit into my pizza, I could taste all the fresh and quality toppings. I wish it had a bit more sauce on it but another than that it was quite perfect.   Would I go back? Yes, but I would dine in. I want to see a whole pie and try other items on the menu. To improve my rating, I suggest offering delivery. I know this is a hard location to be doing deliveries and I get it but maybe do postmates or grubhub at least.",

I got the small and the lasagna to share for 2 people and had some for the next day. It is super filling and good reheated too yay. (need to find affordable eats especially on the strip or else you're going to be broke by the end of your trip).   Service sucked at the bar with Paolo.. but the food was so good still got 4/5 stars.   Almost wanted to get the frozen pizzas togo to bring back to my fam. Must go when visiting Vegas! In front of Bally's Hotel! There is an inside area upstairs as well as an open area downstairs (with additional window for togo orders).  If you are debating if you want deep dish or thin because you had a not so positive experience with deep dish before, definitely go with the deep. Giordano's is soo good and will convert you",

If you want deep dish pizza keep in mind it takes roughly 40 minutes so you may not want to come here unless you're ok with relaxing and chatting with whoever you come with.

The spaghetti was good, the sandwich on the other hand made my boyfriend sick. He ate about half and couldn't stomach the rest.  Decent service though.",

She let us place an order before we were seated, so the pizza was ready shortly after we sat down, which was appreciated.  We got a couple of appetizers, which were delicious. I don't typically like Chicago deep dish, but the pizzas were outstanding. I'll be back every time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Pizza is awesome here, the same as Chicago. Keep in mind a deep dish takes 45 minutes to cook, the thin crust takes 35 minutes so I hope you aren't trying to get a quick meal.  I sat at the outside bar on the ground level where you can get the full menu and drinks. I watched some soccer games that they had on several of the 8 TV's. I did not sit in the permanent restaurant, this is just the eating area in the Grand Bazaar Shops. The food is prepped a short distance away in the permanent restaurant and I think they take their private elevator that goes directly to their kitchen.  I had a basic Caesar salad and an individual deep dish pizza. The pizza is awesome and fine by me that it took 45 minutes. The staff was attentive and friendly. I'm pretty sure it helped that it was a Thursday afternoon and I did get here just at the end of what I would consider the lunch rush, but it was pretty dead even considering that.   They have water misters running in the summer and it was comfortable for me.  Happy hour is weekdays from 3-6pm at the bar only. Check it out!",

    "text": "I was torn about writing this review only because the restaurant and staff were great. The food is delicious and so were the drinks. However, my husband, young son and I went out for a late dinner after a relaxing day in our hotel. We decided to go to Giordanos because we've been to the one in Chicago and loved it. While there we were seated at the last table by the entrance, the closest occupied table to us was about 4 empty tables away. Our server was attentive and helpful, our food was great but our experience was ruined by another guest. Towards the end of our dinner my son started to get fussy, my husband went to the restroom and we requested the check. All of a sudden a guest sitting several tables away shouted and asked us to \"leave or go outside\" I was gathering all my belongings, getting ready to pay and waiting on my husband. The guest continued to insult me and shame me for having my son \"out past his bed time\". This person stared me down and continued to shout from her table. I was mortified. My husband couldn't come quick enough. As soon as we got our check we paid and left. I was so humiliated I know this isn't the restaurants fault. I just don't see myself coming back because of this incident. I am a new mom and I'm still learning how to handle different situations but I never have and never will under any circumstance, assume that it is my place to ask another person to leave an establishment because of me. I don't understand what made this individual think she could intervene in a case of a fussy baby. I believe it is above my authority (and audacity) to ask another paying customer with a fussy baby to remove themselves or their baby from the restaurant for something that is completely out of anyones control. This person was harsh and disrespectful. And unfortunately, ruined our experience here.",

So if you regularly visit or are a native you'd understand the vast differences there are in the area that hosts this Chicago style eatery.   My last trip to Chicago I got to try my first deep dish pie from Lou Malnati's. I was aware of Giordano's, but time was not in my favor (my appetite wasn't either, deep dish is filling).   We walked through Bally's a little tipsy and hungry to discover this restaurant had opened up shop in Sin City. Thank goodness I don't have to fly Frontier to compare (don't judge it was a cheap flight).   My significant other got the pasta and I pre-ordered a small deep dish because I like to eat, but don't want to hate myself. The hosts were kind and our waiter was enthusiastic. The restaurant has a nice modern vibe with the kitchen visible from the entrance. The food came promptly (remember pre-order your pie as soon as you know) and we dug in.   Pasta was tasty, rustic, and hot. The pizza looked good, but didn't leave a large impression on me unfortunately. I'm a New York slice kind of guy, but unless it's the water, Lou's in Chicago beat this pie out without hesitation. I have to leave three stars for this joint because the food didn't hit the mark for me.",

Brought it up to their attention and without us asking for anything, they immediately offered us discount- overall I'd say their service was great and responsive, but maybe next time I'll try to order take out and make sure my order was right lol.

On my most recent visit I happened to arrive right at the end of happy hour (3p-6p M-F) and had a half off draft beer and appetizer (I chose the bbq wings). This was perfect to help kill time for the 45min wait to cook the Meat & more Meat DEEP dish pizza. 45 MINUTES is a long time, but if you think about it, you'll probably spend the same amount of time just waiting for a table elsewhere.   The pizza is always fresh, hot, and very filling!!! I love to eat but can usually only make it through 1.5-2 pieces!  Also, if there is a wait for a table here, I'd recommend grabbing a seat at the bar if your party is not too large. It is first come first serve with full service!",

We had to say excuse me a few times to get her attention because she seemed to be looking at something on her podium. After we were seated, our waiter didn't come for at least 15-20 minutes. When she finally came, we ordered two personal deep dish pizzas, which took about 45 minutes to come out. Deep dish typically takes a while, so don't go when you're too hungry!

Not really sure what it is but it didn't taste exactly like the original.  Service here is fine as we didn't have any issues.

    "text": "Before visiting LV I did my research and wanted to eat deep dish pizza! My boyfriend and I got the special deep dish pizza. Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for the pizza but your server will let you know that. We got a pitcher of blue moon and an appetizer of cheesy bread while we were waiting. We probably could've done without the cheesy bread since the deep dish pizza was so filling. Our bill came out to about $60. After eating there of course I found a coupon that says our cheesy bread would've been free! Unfortunately it was too late and we paid $8.95 for the cheesy bread. I wish our waiter would've told us the deal but it's ok. When you come to Vegas, be prepared to spend money! I liked the restaurant and food. It's not something we eat everyday. The restaurant also has big windows so you can see the strip. I'd recommend it and I'd go back.",

Continued to wait for that then finally came out with no pepperoni. Came back with some slightly warm pepperoni on top of same pizza.We could tell because the pizza underneath was cut while the pepperoni on top were not. They offered to redo, we told them we didn't have time to wait for it again. Were told it would be about 8 to 10 minutes. 25 minutes later pizza came out and we took it to go.  2 stars  Because grown up pizza had good flavor even though we had to wait.

I appreciate your message and I am humble to have received it. I'm going to take your offer and please refund us our meal (I have attached the receipt).  I cannot take your second offer in bringing my family back for a second chance.  In Las Vegas, theirs too many restaurants to give one a second chance.  For us, once we love the the food, we write about it and continue to come back to it.  I just believe that there were too many eyes from your staff that saw our pie and didn't take it back or say something.  From the guy that served us (and us pointing it out there, he just turned towards the back like he was looking for someone), to the waiter that saw three half eaten slices on our plates, saw the rest of the pizza untouched and said that our cannoli's we're on our way out.  Instead of asking us if their was a problem or how was our pizza,  would of at least open the door.   Don't let me get started on those poor cannoli's too, they were soft, they came frozen to your kitchen then microwaved (very sad) to our plate.  We're not one to make a scene or to get mad and storm off.  This is why we love Yelp! You even made a comment that \"the execution of my pizza wasn't right\".  I totally agree, and I agree that there are different types of thickness to deep dishes in Chicago but the one that's pictured on each of your tables (for marketing, to take a deep dish home) isn't what we got. Even pictures that I screen shot and attached here have that second layers you guys promote (and you mentioned) and ours had a cheese thick bottom, with a barely rationed sauce and some pepperonis.  I just believe that customers should have that one time experience to continue to come back.  Unfortunately, ours was just overlooked, ignored and we are here.   But I wish you and your restaurant the best.   Let me know if you need anything else for my refund.   Regards, Luis F.  image1.JPG  image2.PNG  Look at the sauce here, along with the two layers as you mentioned.  image4.PNG  Then our sad pizza.  image5.JPG",

It was not remarkable, and continues to be that way. With that said, hearing about Giordano's definitely piqued my interest, so I went as soon as I could.  Service: EVERYONE was authentically friendly and proactive with information. Yes, it will take 45 min. for your deep dish to be finished, but it's worth it. They didn't hide this at all from us, ensured we were okay with this, and we were not disappointed.  Food: I get why people are so crazy about Giordano's. Pizza was fresh, beautiful, and SO DECADENT. Come here hungry. You still won't finish it. Take it home. It's great as a leftover too. We got the appetizer sampler as well, and liked everything. It's your standard stuff, like mozzarella sticks, calamari, etc.  In short- they don't try to reinvent the wheel. Why do it?! They take classics, and make them the best they can be. That's my favorite thing, and if you're a fan too, you'll probably like this place too.",

They said he pie just takes hat long however other Giordanos I have been at simply understand how many of the deep dishes they sell and possibly have them already in the over by default...  Anyways we decided to go with faster food like pasta and chicken sandwich and so on.  It took and hour to get it to the table. And when we finally had it they tried to get us to leave by cleaning items we went done with. So annoying.   Food was mediocre. The waitress was nice but tied to bad management and restaurant policies.  We gave her a good tip and decided at least moan on Yelp.",

I cold imagine that sitting out there in the summer could become kind of hot but it looks like they have a mist system installed.....still prob going to be hot though.    Knowing that our pizza would take 45 minutes we were unsure of what appetizer to order, luckily they have a sampler plate so it made it easy.  The sampler plate came out and it soon become apparent that we should have just ordered the mozzarella trianges....they were by far the all star out of the bunch, followed up by the wings.  So the pizza came out and the waiter did the long string cheese move.  Pizza was pretty good but my only gripe is that they don't have honey to eat the crust with.  The honey would have pushed this review up to a 5 star and the end crust really needs it if you're going to eat the whole thing.    The service is what you'd expect and our waiter kept coming back to make sure we were doing ok while waiting for the pizza.  Overall a good place to eat...when we come back I might have to smuggle in some honey for the crust.",

Tried Chicago style and deep dish both good but I definitely preferred the deep dish. We got spinach, jalapeno and chicken sausage and seriously it was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. The chicken sausage was flavorful and jalapenos added a good amount of kick.   So you can get good food and drinks a lot of places, yes. What makes this place better? The service. They were so on top of what we needed even when we didn't realize we needed it. I mean I was never thirsty what so ever.   Give this place a go. Then go again. And again. And again.

Our server, Ken, was so helpful and knowledgeable, he made it an even better experience! We got the stuff crust, medium for $25 (more than enough for 2 people) we ended up taking most of it home. Of course, the cheese pull pictures are my MOST favorite, I also loved the pastry crust. It's flaky and soft and crunchy- all at the same time. The patio makes it extra nice to sit outside.",

The restaurant part takes a long time, 40 minutes or so, to make your pizza fresh, so if you're short on time (like we always are!) we always do the carry out window instead!

Salad came out within 5 minutes and was told the pizza would be 45 or so minutes. After almost an hour and not being updated or checked on, I had to ask. Was told 10 more minutes and was patient and waited. Another 15 minutes passed and asked again and at that point the hostess chimed in. She blamed us for getting a pizza and said we should have known it would take an hour. Our pizza was ready finally and we asked for it to go because we were done sitting there. The bartender seemed mad and wasn't polite once we asked for it to go. We paid and he didn't apologize or say a thing. On our way out the hostess snickered and walked to the bartender to clearly say something. It's awful that we were recommended here and spent our Monday night waiting on food that no one seemed to care about in the restaurant. We will not be back nor recommended this places. We did not expect anything but for the bartender to at least check in and keep us updated - that should be expected at any restaurant. Awful hostess - very rude and VERY disappointed with this place.",

It was much less of everything, not as stuffed and deep, and not enough sauce. The Pizza at their Chicago locations has had me spoiled sorry to say. The Chicago locations pizza are huge. I could only maybe eat 1 to 2 slices at the Most in Chicago. But here in Las Vegas the pizza I ate tonight was not the same. I was able to eat 3 almost 4 slices. Plus at $33 for a medium pizza that me and my boyfriend shared? That is a lot of money for what we got. Maybe with a little more work, they could catch up to their Chicago locations quality.",

I've seen some couples having blank stares at the wall while waiting for their food lol. So it's good to come here with good company.  We ordered appetizers and drinks while we waited for our pizza. Their house salad and buffalo wings took a while to come out too but it was well worth the wait along with the pizza. We had the small Chicago classic deep dish pizza (23.75$) which was the perfect serving for three people. It came with pepperoni , mushrooms , green peppers and onions. We ordered ours without onions but it came out with no green peppers instead. We didn't really mind eating the onions or not having the green peppers (it would only be a problem for us if one of us were allergic to onions) plus it would be a hassle to take back the order and wait another 45 minutes for our new pizza to come out. The deep dish pizza still tasted pretty amazing though even with the onions.  Service was top notch and I love the ambiance they have. They have both an upstairs & downstairs along with a take-out booth. It's easy to find at the Grand Bazaar Shops @ Bally's hotel. I had no problem with parking although I can see it being hectic on the weekends & holidays. Overall , I say this place to worth going out to on the strip as a local (and non-locals) ! Prices aren't that bad either being on the strip and the quality of the food.",

    "text": "Would you like a pizza with your cheese? That's pretty much what a chicago deep dish pizza is all about. If you don't like cheese, I do suggest you turn your little tush around and walk out before you do something you'll end up regretting.   Came here to have an early dinner with my boyfriend, his cousin, and my brother. We've been hearing and seeing so much about Giordano's and it was a perfect opportunity to go. The cousin was visiting from overseas and he loves burgers and pizzas so what's better than showing him something he can't find outside of America?   We were seated rather quickly after we got to the establishment. They actually have two locations -- sort of. One outdoor area and one that's indoors but on the upper floor.   Beware, if you're ordering a pizza, be sure you know which one you want asap and order that first because their pizzas take a good amount of time to be cooked.   We ended up ordering a house salad, cheesy garlic bread, and their small classic chicago deep dish pizza. The salad was a salad. Th cheesy garlic bread was pretty good -- although, I may prefer regular garlic bread. It had good flavor but I think the cheese interrupts a lot of the buttery garlic goodness. To me, anyways.   The pizza, oh man, the pizza. Cheesy, gooey, warm, hearty, fulfilling goodness. There was pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. But who cares what's in it! It's the CHEESE that matters! It was DELICIOUS GOODNESS. If you get a large size of their stuffed deep dish pizza, they put 1 kilo of cheese in it, which is roughly 2.2lbs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very filling though so be sure you come hungry, otherwise, you won't be eating much and you'll be facing a lot of left overs. I only managed to eat one slice of the pizza cause it was just too much for me! Regardless though, it was very delicious.   The prices of everything were also very reasonable for the strip. We got a pitcher of blue moon and it only cost about $17. That was 4 glasses of beer .. which would've cost us close to $28 total if we were to drink elsewhere.  I would definitely recommend Giordano's if you're in the area and if you love cheese :)",

The TV's and the crowd passing by kept us entertained. The service kept us happy. The Stuffed Chicago Classic kept us wishing we lived closer to a Giordanos. Keep in mind that this is deep dish pizza, and the wait staff will tell you that it takes 45 minutes to prepare (it's worth the wait!).

I was aware their deep dish pizza take an hour to bake but was okay with that knowing how great my last experience was.  When the pizza arrived and I dug in I became disappointed quickly.  Where was the pepperoni?  How can you have a pepperoni pizza without pepperoni?  While I understand I ordered a individual deep dish, I expected it to be a mini version of a full pizza.    It was not.  I attend a conversation every year in Las Vegas and the disappointing experience won't get me rushing back.",

    "text": "The SECOND best Chi Town deep dish makes it to Vegas!  I don't care if I cause a fight.  I'm a Malnati's fan but that said, there is no better example of the deep dish in Vegas at the moment.  If you never had a deep dish in Chicago, you don't know what you're missing.  Beautiful golden brown, buttery crust adds incredible richness to what must be a 2\" deep,  5lb, loaded pie full of sweet Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, salami, and bacon all sitting atop a molten lake of melted mozzarella topped by a chunky crushed tomato sauce (\"meat & more meat\").  Need a little veg to feel healthy?  The \"Special\" replaces the pure carnivore stuffing with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions and IMHO is better than the \"Chicago Classic\" that subs pepperoni for the incredible Italian sausage.  Best part of the veg, despite the long cooking time, all add flavor while still maintaining some integrity and none, including the mushrooms leave residual water in the pie.  There are more creative pies for the non traditionalist including a vegetarian option.  Additional non traditional fillings (olives, broccoli, jalepenos, meatballs, anchovies, bbq chicken, chicken breast, pesto chicken, and heaven forbid pineapple are all available if you just gotta go all West Coast and ruin the classic.  Note:  Deep dish pies take 45 minutes to cook.  Follow the recommended serving suggestions, they are large.  Think in pounds not ounces.   Tip:  skip the starters, pastas, sandwiches, and ridiculous thin crust.  Keep your eye on the prize.  Efficient, Strip friendly service.    While not as good as the same pies in Chicago; could be the water, the air, maybe the sweat from the Midwest pizza maker, perhaps the angst of Chicago itself, it's still plenty authentic and just plain good.",

    "text": "When I found out Vegas was opening a Giordano's, I could not rush there more quickly. I fell in love with the pizza in its hometown, Chicago, and it did not disappoint in Vegas as the taste I remembered was the same. You need to get the deep dish. It takes 45 minutes to make the pizza, so be prepared to wait awhile and enjoy yourself, or order ahead of time so it will be ready when you get there.  The ambience is clean, and there are floor-to-ceiling windows all around the restaurants with views on the strip. The inside is clean, and the service is spot on. It is kind of a pain to get to, but worth the paying for parking, and walking 10-20 minutes. I like to park at the Bellagio, check out the gardens and walk by the fountain on my way to the restaurant as it is at the front entrance of Bally's.   The prices are reasonable, and this restaurant would be a good option to celebrate a special event. It is spacious enough to accommodate bigger groups.   If you can't get to Chicago, go here. Worth it.",

The 2 deep dishes that we ordered (Chicago, pepperoni), were delicious.  All fresh ingredients were you can truly taste the food. Great flaky crust but that's pretty much all the bread you get as it's loaded with cheese, sauce and toppings which is not a bad thing at all especially if you love cheese.

This place is located in the shopping mall right in front of bally's, which was not a far walk since we were staying at the Paris hotel.  We decided to sit at the table in which we asked for a chicago pizza and also requested to have happy hour as well. The server told us that we would need to sit at the bar in order to get the happy hour deals (50% off on draft pints, which is around 2.50 depending on the beer.  We decided to change seats and understood that we had to wait for the pizza (about 45 mins). I decided to ask the server again if they had placed the order in after 30 just because I felt something off. The server said he did not because we changes from a table seating to the bar, but after a bit, the server let the bartender know that to put in or order and speed up it because the order wasn't placed in. Since we didn't have any time constraints, my friend and I were cool with waiting (since we did not have any time constraints for that day) and just ordered more beer due to the happy hour prices. The bartender came by after a bit and said that due to the mixup, they offered to waive our whole pizza as long as we paid for the beer. We still offered to pay for the pizza and beer since this was a communication mixup on both parties.  We were able to get our Pizza, which was a small chicago style - meat and more meat pizza. The crust was really nice and flaky, almost like a pastry crust and the amount of cheese and toppings in each slice lets you know that this pizza will fill you up. The amount of cheese and toppings makes it feel like a different experience than your normal pizza. The ingredients themselves were tasty and were nicely cooked. My friend and I were able to finish the whole pizza and were stuffed by the end.   Even though they waived the pizza, we still left a tip just because they were willing to fix something that wasn't exactly their fault. We did have to stay for more than two hours, but nevertheless the beer was good.  All in all I would come back to this place for the happy hour deals and just to share a slice or two of Chicago style pizza with some friends.",

The wait was about 40mins for a deep dish pizza but I didnt mind. They also have a to-go window with pizzas already made and hot waiting but I wanted the real deal fresh off the oven version so I waited.The service was great and employees very nice. The upstairs restaurant was cool too with nice decor.The missing star of the show was the pizza. The ingridients did not taste fresh. The sauce was just \"ok\" but I remembered it being so much better than it was. The itakian sausage was actually not very tasty or good. The sausage just didnt taste that great and I was surprised. The pepperoni tasted like hornel brand and not very good quality. I dont know. Maybe my tastebuds overhyped the pizza as a kid but its just not that great anymore. Its good pizza but not great and I actually will likely throw away the leftovers. Maybe it taste better a day later. The cheese did taste good and fresh. Given all the calories and the wait, I would not come back for \"ok\" pizza. They do have regular crust pizza which takes less time and looked great. The presentation of the deep dish pizza was great just the taste was mediocre. I tried it a few years back again in Chicago and alao felt the exact same way. Something is off with the taste and I cant put my finger on it. Sadly I would not go back to any of the restaurants anymore. I guess you can never go home again :(  I also found the pizza to be salty (likely due to the pepperoni and sausage). but I also feel they skimped on the sauce. you had all this cheese and meat and barely a covering of sauce. I dont know I really was a bit disappointed and it totally turned me off to the whole brand. The pizzas used to be so good at Giordanos. Just not sure what happened.",

    "text": "Absolutely amazing!!!! When we got there the wait time was 30 to 45 minutes unless we wanted to sit at the bar. Knowing that it takes 45 minutes for the best pizza ever we chose to sit at the bar, which was the best decision. Jackie was our server and she was phenomenal. I have never had service anywhere before the way she was. The place was packed and she kept her cool and between her and katilyn(?) they kept the bar running smoothly even with the getting everyone at the bar their food asap. Even if the food sucked which it didn't i would come back just to sit at the bar and eat with them there. Looking for food suggestions the deep dish is amazing just remember perfection takes 45 minutes to cook and if you are looking for an appetizer and love garlic the cheesy garlic bread is to die for. Jackie and Kaitlyn were the absolute best just cannot get over how good the service was for such a busy night.",

    "text": "We went to Giordano's today for my husbands birthday. We got there right at 11 when they opened and were the seated first. Our waiter Markus informed us right when we sat down that it would be 45 minutes for a deep dish pizza, so we ordered it right away when he took our drink order. We told him to get the drinks and we would order the appetizers/salads. Well we got our drinks from a runner and didnt see our server until we got our check. I had to order a salad 45 minutes after getting our drinks from a runner. You'd think that if it was a 45 minute wait for pizza they would see if we wanted any appetizers or at least keep our drinks full the whole time, which wasn't the case. We got our kids food 15 minutes after ordering then waited an hour and 5 minutes for our pizza!!! We were the very first order of the day. By the time we got the pizza our kids were done eating and ready to go. So my husband and i ate a slice or two and got a box for the rest. We went to pay the check and left the box on the table weny back to get it and they threw our pizza away!!! The pizza we waited an hour and 5 minutes for and paid for. Service was absolutely horrible and the manager didn't do a dang thing, didn't even help his staff. It looked like only two servers were in the floor while we were there. The runners did more work than the wait staff and manager. Thanks for a great birthday lunch that my whole family was truly looking forward to....we will definitely NOT BE BACK!!",

    "text": "We had been anxiously awaiting our visit to Giordano's ever since we first heard they were coming to Las Vegas. We got there about 4pm on a Monday night and the restaurant was not crowded. They only have a few booths for large parties, so we sat by the windows overlooking the shops at Bally's. We both had eaten at Giordano's in Chicago before so we knew exactly what we wanted and order our  Medium Sausage/Mushroom Deep dish pizza right away. The pizza took 1 hour to make it to our table, so plan accordingly if you are in a hurry. The pizza was good but had hardly any sausage or mushrooms. For $27.00 you would expect this pizza to have more meat on it. The crust was as good as we remember. But I must also comment on the cheese, which oozes all over the place once the pizza is cut (not crazy about that). Giordano's is not the best pizza place in Chicago, but it is the best Chicago deep dish pizza in Las Vegas. We will definitely be back to try the extra thin pizza, and hope if will be our new thin crust pizzeria in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I give this review a 2 star only because the pizza was amazing and if it weren't for the pizza I would give absolutely no stars to one of the most awkward and uncomfortable dining in experiences I have ever had. Let's start with the moment I walked in. At approximately 3:35p on Jan 20 we walked in and were never greeted so then I brought it to the hostess attention that I had called in an order and was told that the pizza would be ready. prior to this day we came in a week ago to enjoy a giordanos pizza only to find out that the wait time unfortunately was not a fit for my wrk schedule that night so the guys told us we can call in next time so that our pizza would be ready for dine-in. Back to the hostess today, she asked if we ordered it to go, I told her no one asked me if it was to go or for dine in so we would like to dine in. By the look in her face she looked annoyed to have to seat us and told us \"I have to ask a manager if it was possible for them to seat us\" as I look around the empty room with absolutely NO line and about 20 open tables. I felt like the decision was pretty obvious. As she comes back she said \"they will try to figure it out\". The manager then comes to our table and asked if we were dining in as if the first time I told them wasn't enough. She then seats us and asked if we wanted to keep our pizza in the to-go box or place it on a tray the way any other dine-in customer has it. We then said \"it doesn't matter, thank you\" so then one of the girls brought it out to our table in the to go box. We then stared blankly at each other wondering why an establishment this big had a problem with setting up our dish on a tray for paying customers as if it were out of their way to serve us. It's a PIZZA!! not that hard to put on a tray. Not only did they make us feel uncomfortable we were also ready to enjoy a few drinks from the bar and as I was trying to pull the pizza out of the box another server comes to help us and puts the pizza back in the box, accidentally, cause the manager/staff didn't inform him we were in fact going to dine in. Not only was he not informed but neither were the two serves after him. Don't get me wrong, they (men) did their job accordingly. But at this point we didn't know who our server even was. We didn't have a set server. As we're sitting there still thirsty, we never properly got served because we never had a set waiter to ask what exactly we wanted to drink. The manager instead brings us just waters but never once asked if we wanted anything else to drink. At this point we can see the girls (manager and hostess) discussing how annoying we were to them as if they couldn't have that conversation in the back without making it obvious. Already one slice in, one of the girls says we cannot pay in there, we need to go down stairs to pay for our meal. After everything we went through we just ok, that's fine thank you. Then we get ANOTHER server come tell us he would switch our ticket so we can pay up in the dining area instead of having to go down stairs but one of the girls proceeded to tell him we had to go down stairs. Our second slice in, one of the male servers was nice enough to refill our water and got us our bill for us instead of having us go down stairs. In my head I'm thinking 'how was this so hard for them to seat us, serve us, and bring our ticket'?! There must not be a hiring process to work here. We then have another server bring us our check in which this point we have no idea who we were to tip. We were honestly just ready to get out of that restaurant and as we walk toward the doors on our way out, both the female manager with the glasses and hostess give us an ugly look and continue their conversation as if we were a burden to that place. The male servers, however were great and tried to keep us happy. Pizza was delicious but dining here again isn't something that sounds too convincing. Now, not ONCE did we have an attitude or be rude with them what so ever and still kept a smile on our faces but if this was my establishment, I'd definitely look into the staff represents giordanos",

    "text": "My first and last visit here was very unpleasant. I was baffled at the type of service my family and I received during our dine here.  It was our first time trying deep dish pizza and we were really excited. Although we were really hungry, we didn't mind the 45 minute wait. After the 1 hour mark hit, we started getting a little antsy. The table behind us who arrived after us received their food first. PLUS, they ordered the same dish as us! Our server asked if we wanted the Fettuccine Alfredo first or altogether. We were starving so we asked for the pasta to come out whenever it's ready. I'm taking a huge guess by saying that they gave our order to the table behind us by mistake. More than an hour passed by and we were ready to leave. My parents were so upset and that made me even more angry. It's their first trip back to Vegas in years and the service from this restaurant was a huge disappointment. Please be honest with your customers and tell us that you made a mistake by sending the same order to the wrong table. Do not give us False hope by telling us it'll be ready in five mins when you've said that already the last 5 times. As we were about to get up to leave, our food finally arrived.   The taste was mediocre. Definitely not worth the service or the wait. The table behind us who received the same order first, took two bites, and asked for the check. What a waste! Guess they weren't satisfied with the taste as well.   Please note that only service dogs are allowed. Even if you bring your service dog, it is frowned upon and the servers will give you shit for having one.  Not the most friendly place in Vegas. You could do better. Take your family elsewhere and stay away from this restaurant.",

It's even tougher finding a place with menu items he'll actually like, and even tougher when it's Italian food. For those not in the EOE world, our son is on a \"Top 8\" elimination diet, so no soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, dairy, or wheat/gluten. After a discussion with our server, who took our laminated wallet card with our son's restrictions back to the chef, we ordered him the vegetarian/vegan spaghetti with the gluten-free pasta. He loved it!   Living in Vegas, all our relatives come to visit; and we usually end up doing a day down on the strip. A reasonably-priced Italian restaurant with something our son likes in a centrally-located casino is a needle-in-a-haystack kind of place. And on top of all that the service and food were both above average for places at this price point located on the strip.  This is now our go-to option!",

Round 1: The BBQ chicken bites were dipped generously and the ranch was fantastic. They also brought them out very quickly. I would say they are great to feed 2-3 people for an appetizer.  Round 2: Pepperoni and cheese deep dish. I was blown away with the amount of cheese and the quality of the sauce they used. The fact the server asked if we wanted her to serve the first slice was a nice touch. The small will feed 2-3 people.   Service was fantastic and the speed overall was great!   10/10 recommend.",

We were promptly seated at lunchtime by the window with a view of the Grand Bazaar Shops and the Strip, but while the view was nice, spacing was quite tight in that area and I had a wobbly chair.  Also, when we asked our server a question, rather than ask if we needed more time to decide (we didn't), she just walked off.  Service was fine after that, and I don't know if it was because I was starving but I thought the food was good.  If getting deep dish pizza, they recommend ordering an appetizer as it takes 45 minutes for the pizza to cook.  We did just that and ordered a Caesar salad, along with our half Special and half Chicago Classic pizza for 2.  I liked the salad, but my dining companion thought it was too saucy and didn't have enough pepper.  As for the pizza, talk about filling!  A small was more than enough for two people to share.  Come with an appetite, or be ready to take home leftovers.  It was a good lunch spot for us two hungry people to satisfy our appetites.",

They have one location on the bottom terrace right outside of Bally's and one on the second to the right as you walk out from the bridge that takes you from Bally's and to the Strip.   We first ordered the fried calamari, mozzarella triangles, and the garlic cheese bread. My favorite was the mozzarella triangles. They give a pretty good serving of each appetizer which is great. You will want more once you are done with it.   The pizza is Chicago styled and tastes great. The dough is not too greasy and is cooked to perfection. We ordered the meat lovers version that they have here and loved it. The sausage was a little on the spicy side but very tasty.   I would have given a higher rating but our waiter (Garvey-think that's what his name was) didn't really attend to us as much as we wanted him to. It seemed that he forgot about us because we never got refills on our drinks, took awhile to get a box for our leftovers, and to get our check. We ended up asking another waiter for everything and that's when Garvey came back but it already had ruined the experience.   For all the money we paid, attentiveness and ensuring your customers needs is a must.",

We went up to the restaurant and had some pretty amazing deep dish. I myself, am never a huge thick crust fan, but this was buttery and delicious. The pizza was great, the side salad was super simple yet oh so good! It was a great way to end our night!",

    "text": "Great place to hit while in Vegas! I had never really tried Chicago Deep Dish pizza, so I planned to visit Giordano's during our trip.  Wait time was about 20-25 mins, not too bad. Our server was scatterbrained, but thank god for the bussers who kept my water filled anyway.  Prices were really not too bad in my opinion. Husband and I got out of there with a $35 check. We started with fried mozzarella, which were a nice portion (I want to say it was 8 triangles). They came out piping hot and just delicious. Word of advice, deep dish pizza takes time, so do yourself a favor and order an appetizer.  We both ordered the personal 6\" size deep dish, build your own with our desired toppings. Those came out piping hot, in fact so hot that we decided to take them to go. Nothing against the restaurant, we were just tired and wanted to return to our hotel quickly. Once we got back, the pizzas were still hot and absolutely delicious. They do not skimp on cheese or toppings. Their gardineira is very nice, and spicy! Definitely recommend Giordano's! If we ever come back to Vegas, I know I'll be back here again.",

Just make sure you come in with some time for your pizza to get done, about 50 min. It's a little bit pricey but well worth it. I had some left over and had it for breakfast, warmed it up in the microwave and it was still bomb! I'm literally planning a trip to Vegas just to go back to this spot!",

Worst part about the whole experience is that you have to wait 45 minutes for your pizza.  It's so worth it though.",

Regardless of me being a veteran she has no compassion so I decided to not patronize the establishment.  I will mention by name the greeter Xavier was pleasant regardless of the amount of makeup he had on he was nice.  My point is choose wisely where u decide to spend your hard earned money I do not recommend this establishment",

    "text": "My best friend really wanted to try the Famous Giordano's Pizza and since we weren't going to go to Chicago anytime soon, we thought to try it here around Saturday at 1 am. When we got seated, it took a good 15 minutes for our server to come take our order. We asked if substitutions could be made on one of the speciality pizza's and he said no but we could do the make our own. So we tell him what we want on the make your own pizza but he then specifies it is a thin crust pizza. At that point, we decide we're just go with a small cheese pizza double dish with the toppings of our choice.   He ask us if we want anything to drink and we tell him water. The restaurant is not that busy but our server forgets our drink order and after 10 minutes we chase him down and he promptly brings it to us. The pizza itself took more than 45 minutes to come out and even the table next to us was complaining.  Now when the pizza does arrive, I take a bite into it and the toppings (mushrooms, onions) that I ordered on the pizza are cold and even the dough is not cooked well. The sauce on the pizza lacked any sort of taste. My best friend's pizza also felt cold in the center. We both felt the pizza wasn't freshly made but instead pre-made and warmed up in the microwave. We were disappointed that we just took one bite and asked for the check.  I never met a pizza I didn't like but the lack of good service and the fact the pizza was not fresh makes me feel this particular establishment needs improvement. I will not be back..",

I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and artichokes, chicken alfredo with extra broccoli and a side salad with extra dressing. Got it delivered and it took almost 2 hours to get it. When i asked if they were busy they said \"kind of but not really\". I live 2 miles away...anyways, the pizza was luke warm, the pasta lacked sauce and didnt have the extra broccoli we ordered and the side salad didnt have extra dressing that we ordered. But they upgraded the side salad to an entree for the wait lol Well After i heated the pizza back up in the oven it did not meet my expectations of a $20 small pizza. For $50+ the food should be better, if not maybe lower the price and people wont expect anything special. Very disapointed.",

It time to address the issue ad once at our table he picked up the pizza and inspected it very closely to his face ( in doubt ) and with a long face and no apology left with the pizza to the kitchen area....  we would not dine with them again .....",

The sauce was made there and not your standard pizza sauce along with it being super cheesy. Highly suggested!",

    "text": "Came in here to get some food after landing in Vegas and decided to sit at the bar. The service at the bar was a little hit and miss sadly. Even though the bar was pretty empty it took a while for the bartender to greet or acknowledge me.  I ordered a personal cheese pizza, Caesar salad and, a beer.  I was told when I ordered that the pizza would take 45 mins to come because it was a deep dish, which was completely fine. The beer was cold and served pretty fast. The salad took about 20 mins to come. It was good though. The lettuce was crisp and it was well dressed. I waited for the pizza to come and waited. Finally the bartender went to go check on it after over an hour of waiting. She comes back and drops it off and it was the wrong pizza. She gave me a sausage pizza instead of the cheese I ordered. I flagged her down and told her that it was wrong and she told me it was what I had ordered. Until she went back and checked the computer. Then came back took the pizza and went to find the one that I had ordered. It was another 15-20 mins before the pizza came out. I was disappointed that there was no apology or anything said it was just plopped in front of me. But I was extremely hungry at that point.  The pizza itself was awesome. It was cheesy deliciousness that was flakey and saucy. It was definitely a Chicago deep dish that you would expect.  Even after waiting so long for the pizza and the mix up with the first one the bartender never came back to see if everything was ok. I was sitting at the bar, it wouldn't have been hard to do a quick fly by. By the time I got the check I had been there for over two hours most of the time just waiting.  The food here is great, but the service left something to be desired.",

OMG is the only way I can describe the pizza. There is about a 40-45 minute wait for the pizza, but let me tell you it is so worth it. This is probably the best deep dish pizza I have eaten ever. From the cheese, to the sauce, down to the crust this pie was perfect! I would recommend Giordano's to anyone look for great pizza on the Strip",

The cashier at the window did warn me when I arrived to pay that it would take about 15 to 20 minutes of wait...which is ridiculous because isn't the point of online ordering to get your food to-go upon arrival instead of waiting longer inside the restaurant? I placed an online order to save time so I can get on with my other plans for the rest of tonight!  About 5 minutes ago I asked the cashier again for my order and only then did she glance at my receipt under the scanner on the register that she tells me \"they're just cutting up your pizza\" and \"it'll be here soon.\" Then I spotted her putting my receipt on the board. (Something tells me that chick never placed my order to the kitchen...).  Not impressed with this Vegas location. Sadly the multiple Giordano's in Chicago will always be better.  ----------------------  **edit** 40 minutes! Went up to the window and the cashier already knew what I was about to ask. She offered to call her manager (which I agreed to) and moments later he arrived to speak with me. He explained that my pizza was ready (side note: WHY is it the food arrives right when you begin to complain and demand a refund?!), but the salad and appetizers were only a few more minutes away. I was tired enough already, so I still asked to cancel everything. He voided my payment for the order, apologized multiple times, but did ask once again if I wanted the pizza...which was sitting in the warmer(?!?!). Ugh, fine then, give me the pizza! Why did that come out first anyway????  While I do appreciate the manager coming to talk to me while quickly getting the problem resolved without forcing me to resorting to acting rude (*thank you*), this entire experience shouldn't have happened at all and no one should have to go through that ever.",

My Wife and I decided to try something different this time we headed into the desert. We decided to take the kids, a venture that we were a bit unsure of at the time. Super glad we did.  We spent a little time researching family friendly restaurants and Giordano's came up on every list. We LOVE Pizza Rock but wanted to try something different and something we'd all appreciate.   Honestly, it was probably our favorite meal of the trip and we hit a lot of good spots. We ordered the Chicago deep dish pie with meatballs. It was phenomenal! So cheesy. So delicious. Sauce was perfect. And the crust... Oh, man. Like a perfectly buttery, flaky pie crust. Very authentic. It takes 30 -45 minutes for the pizza to come out once you order (typical for Chicago style pies) but well worth it. The service was really good. Just one of those dining experiences that you really appreciate. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Realized this place opened up about 3 weeks ago! Located on the second floor on top of the 24 hour Starbucks at the Bally's Bazaar area.   I never had the famous deep dish Chicago style pizza (pie) and I finally got to experience it! I went with family and we ordered their sampler that had garlic cheesy bread, chicken nugget ball shaped minis, tater tots that tasted like mac n cheese with bacon (my favorite thing! YUM!), and mozzarella triangles!   For pizza, we ordered the Deep Dish Meat lovers and we also ordered the Supreme Veggie that usually goes on the Deep Dish but we switched it out for thin crust instead!   There is a 45 minute wait on the Deep Dish pizzas but that wasn't a problem for us. Just to let everyone know!  Both were really tasty and I definitely enjoyed them!  Overall the experience was ok, I wasn't really hooked on the pizza to want to come back anytime soon honestly. Our server was extremely friendly and extremely knowledgeable about explaining the items on the menu! I do have to mention that one of the receptionists was rather rude and the man that seated us at our table was even worse! Could be the reason why I wouldn't want to bring any friends or family back to this place.",

    "text": "For a weird setting and location - all outside and in the desert, Giordano's Las Vegas at the Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops, it's a unique and exceptional experience!  Being alone, I ordered the 6\" Chicago Classic, which is a wonderful Chicago pie (sauce on top, baby!) with pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and onions. It was 100% as I imagined it. Perfectly cheesy, rich sauce, BIG and DELICIOUS toppings and awesome crust. Additionally, I had two 23oz beers for an extremely low price for the Las Vegas strip.  But, in addition to all that, I had the perfect and fun waiter that filled me in on some of his \"fun/not so fun\" experiences as an Uber driver at night.   I don't have a negative thing to say about the place. If you LOVE Chicago Deep Dish Pies like me, you will NOT be disappointed. Just make sure you have the time to spend there. It takes about 40+ minutes to make your dish. Plus, it's all outside dining, so plan accordingly in regards to sunlight, heat and time of day.  Giordano's Vegas (/5 Stars.)",

They just opened and everything fro service, to food, to ambiance has been on point for an authentic deep dish pizza joint right in the strip in front of Ballys! Buffalo wings were perfectly crispy with the a great blue cheese and buffalo sauce on the side. Plenty TVs for any type of sports you want. Wait for a pizza is a little long but I'm sure it's well worth it! Hopefully it'll be as good at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago.  Stopped by and sat at the bar and Jennifer the Asian bartender was very welcoming, friendly and attentive. Felt like she was family and made me feel very comfortable.   Definitely recommend checking out this spot if you're in the mood for some deep dish pizza, some good drinks at the bar and sports on tv. I'm a restauranteur and would definitely hire someone like Jennifer to run one of my bars of she'd ever move to San Jose!",

We had the Italian sub salad (can't remember the exact name) and a few pizzas - veggie, cheese, meat lovers.  I had veggie and I thought it was pretty darn good with the veggies inside and outside the pizza.  It is heavy which is the main reason for my rating.  However, if you like deep dish, cheesy cheesy pizza, this is for you.   My sister did say that it did not taste the same as the one in Chicago, so maybe I'll try it again if I go there one day.  I must say, although the pizza took about 30-40 minutes to make, service was great, especially being a large party!",

First off, (I can't remember his name I'm sad) our server was so friendly and welcoming and made us feel excited to be there. We ordered some drinks which came out super fast! The bruschetta was so delish, I was almost tempted to order another plate of it..but that would've taken up too much room for our deep dish cheese pizza. Holy guacamole was that pizza was good. Soooo much melty cheese that STAYED melty. The cheese never solidified, it stayed so fresh and hot and melted the whole time. So simple yet so yummy! We ate every single bite of everything and were so full when we left. Definitely a new favorite spot!",

The thin crust pizza was awesome but was disappointed I couldn't get it for the smaller size so I wasted 1/2 of it  Good amount of spinach on top of a delicious crisp crust; served piping hot!",

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the deep dish was pretty soggy in the middle. Not exactly \"cold\", but not what you would want your pizza to taste like. We all ate one slice and were finished. It wasn't worth enduring the soggy, clammy cheese and crust in the center. At least the appetizer was good!",

I've had the pizza before so I wanted to try something else on the menu and I'm super glad we did. The wings are AMAZING. they're super crispy and fresh - I can't believe they don't get more attention (but also it's a pizza place so I get it). I highly suggest the hot wings.   Also side note, pizza is good. For sure try it.",

    "text": "So to officially kick off my month of follow up reviews I decided to begin with Giordanos as the 5 star rating has not changed, but my preference of what to order here sure has since my original posting so this just seems fitting.  Before getting into the food I want to say that the staff is still amazing here. I have dined a few times now and I have yet to encounter poor service. We've always been warmly greeted at the host stand and the wait staff has always been a pleasure. You can tell when someone is there just to clock in and out each day, but they do appear to love what they do and it shows.  Food wise, while their deep dish pizza is their claim to fame I have fallen in love now with their thin crust pies. A lot of the pizza tends to get lost in the thickness of the deep dish, but with the thin crust call me crazy it allows for the ingredients to speak louder.   The wife and I split a medium super veggie pizza and that was just about 2 pieces too many to split, but it did end up being a perfect amount for us. What I love is the freshness of all ingredients themselves. I admit I'm not a fan of the spinach (despite LOVING spinach) paired with the rest of the \"pizza salad\" as I call this pizza, but I guess maybe it could be substituted (never really asked). The high point for me is ironically enough the broccoli. It's always crisp and pops with the sauce thrown into the mix. I guess this is one way to get a kid to eat his or her vegetables. Haha!  I'm pleased to see that Giordanos has stood its ground in the ever changing Vegas landscape. It has been a go-to for a pizza craving and to date I haven't even exercised the thought of looking elsewhere which is validation of a good meal in its own right.",

I came here with the same expectations, and was a bit disappointed.   We got the veggie deep dish pizza, it has mushrooms, broccoli, onions, garlic, peppers and olives. The pizza didn't taste as good as I remembered, maybe it's because it wasn't hot when I got it.   We sat at the bar and ate. We got a Moscow Mule and a Bloody Mary that we're standard. The atmosphere was fine, it just felt like a bar. The bar staff was really great and attentive.",

They wanted to try Chicago pizza and so they ordered that deep dish pizza after couple appetizers.  We all amazed at how this pizza loaded and look like a pie when we took a slice. I started eating with a fork and knife since I could't fold it and it just drips when I took by hand. Of course our eyes are bigger than our stomach. Overall, their food and service were good.  But for three of us , NYC pizza still the best. (So far)  No offense to Chicago pizza, but that pie is hard to fold and to be eaten without fork and knife unless you don't mind being messy all over yourself.   So, Happy Eating pizza with fork, knife and napkin.  ( pun intended)",

    "text": "So disappointed.   We ordered a personal deep dish to go with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms ($17). We were quoted 35 minutes but waited more like 45, which isn't a big deal if the pizza was good...   The pizza came out and we dug right in. The cheese inside of the pizza was barely melted, and the dough was not fully cooked all the way through. If the pizza was cooked for another ten minutes it may have been good, but it wasn't.   We shared the personal pizza between the two of us and there was still a bunch leftover-we ended up just eating the toppings/fillings. Definitely left unsatisfied.   I will not be back, and I do not recommend any one else to come here either.",

The personal cheese pizza I ordered(6inch diameter) was $10, overkill, but it tasted wonderfully. This is a place that you visit with a group of friends where you can all throw $10 to one of their larger options and be engrossed in the entire experience.   The physical space was a True gem of brand specific interior design with use of good materials throughout. The experience did not see cheap at all and they do offer full bartender waitress services. If you are into having a gourmet pizza experience this a great place to go. Will return when I have some friends in town. Glad I came.",

Always order a larger pizza, cause if u take some home, it's great for leftovers!  Please open some in Cali, so I don't have to wait so long to have it!",

Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a great place to eat on the strip, that offers great drinks, and the best service. If you get Michelle, you're in for even better service!",

Well lucky me, because they opened in Vegas!!!!  I nearly pee'd my pants when I found out.  We have to eat here.  On our first night in Vegas, we unpacked our luggage, then marched on down towards Giordano's.  It's located on the 2nd level in a shopping plaza across the Bellagio.  I'm a vegetarian and my husband eats meat, the perfect option was we each ordered an individual deep dish pizza and added our own toppings, plus we shared a salad.  Think our bill was under $40 including tip.  This was the most flavorful pizza I've ever had, and I have only be exposed to Patxi's and Little Star in the SF Bay Area.  Such a treat.  Keep in mind you'll have a wait and the time it takes to bake the food.  Order appetizers if you're hangry.",

Thick Deep Dish Pizza with not just a little bit of cheese but what seemed like layer after layer of delicious mozzarella cheese oozing from every pour of the pizza.  The pizza was very soft from the amount of cheese yet somehow they managed to keep the crust intact so it still had a good crisp crunch to it.  If you are a pizza connoisseur and have children that love pizza this is the place to come to.  I would also highly recommend the Fried Mozzarella Triangles.  These things are a meal in itself !",

    "text": "I'm a cheese addict, and Giordano's pizza is an overdose of one of my favorite things! As if pizza couldn't get any better, the classic deep dish Chicago style pie is loaded up with a ridiculous amount of cheese and toppings. The only downside to this location is that it's on the Strip, which can be a hassle to get to at times but there are some great views from their second floor windows and bar area.  The apps and salads are fresh and fairly light to keep you ready for the pizza, which is the real reason you came here. Each pie takes a while, so go with a fun group (also helps with pricing). Staff were super friendly and will try their best to get the best cheese pull for your photos! So far I've tried the Chicago Classic (pepperoni, mushroom, peppers, onion) and the Super Veggie (mushroom, peppers, onion, broccoli, spinach, olive), and preferred the latter- the cheese was so overwhelming that the added meats weren't necessary.   TIP: Park at Bally's/Paris for closest free option for locals.",

The pizza is made-to-order and takes around 45 minutes to make. Order some drinks or appetizers to kill time while waiting, or you can just enjoy the wait and save room in your stomach for the pizza. The deep dish pizza is literally stuffed. All of your toppings are loaded in with the sauce, and on top is the super stretchy mozzarella cheese. It sounds delicious, and it is indeed. A small deep dish pizza can easily feed 2-3 people, and you may have leftovers if it is just two people. A deep dish pizza starts from around $20 so it makes for a pretty affordable meal in Vegas. Outdoor seating is available at the bar on the ground level and indoor seating is at the restaurant on the second floor. There is also a bar at the restaurant. There are TVs all around so this is a great place to watch a game or just enjoy some good pizza. If you are getting pizza here, make sure to get a deep dish.",

Very kind of her to put in the pizza so that by the time my family and I were seated we would have our food pretty soon there. We were seated at Bruce's table and he was a very kind and cool guy, we ordered cheese curds that tasted phenomenal but then we proceeded to wait an hour and a half for our pizza, Bruce came back and asked what our pizza was. When your server comes to your table after an hour and a half and asks you \"what did you order again\"that's never a good sign. So the manager, angela, was extremely kind with helping us to get our pizza, we ended up not getting the pizza we ordered but we got a larger size pizza and it was taken care of on our check. Although the wait time and time for pizzas wasn't the best, the customer service by Bruce and his manager was second to none. Great people working there, amazing customer service and good food! But the wait times can be very long! At the end of the day you cannot complain when the pizza tastes so good and the smiles and friendliness from the employees contribute to a good experience.

There are two ways to get to this location. One by walking through Bally's from the Paris ( which isn't long), or by walking up the steps from the street entrance.  Directly across from this eatery is another popular food place that I can't think of the name of. There were two nice and friendly hostess that informed us that there was roughly a 10 - 15 minute wait. Our wait time was shorter than that (5 minutes) , and we were seated at a nice window seat with the view of the Bellagio fountains.  I waiter came and he was nice and friendly. They recommend that If you are getting their famous deep-dish-pizza, that you put that in first since it takes about 45minutes for it to cook. We decided on a deep dish pizza have specials and half meat loves. This was my first Chicago style deep dish pizza and it did not disappoint. I had to use a knife and fork to cut eat my pizza because the slices are HUGE.  My only problem was that I had sauce all over my shirt because I kept forgetting that the sauce is on top (so it keep sliding off and hitting my place).  I love this place and will defiantly be returning soon for some more yummy goodness.",

    "text": "My first dinner experience in Las Vegas! Came here a couple of weeks ago on a girls trip and we chose pizza for dinner cause deep dish pizza was calling our names. It was a Friday early evening and not too crowded. Not a long wait which was nice cause we were hungry!   We ended up not getting the deep dish because our server said it would be around a 45-50 minute wait because deep dish takes longer to cook. Since we were so hungry and didn't want to wait long we decided to get the regular pizza instead. It felt like a long wait for our food anyway so idk of getting the regular made that much of a difference.   We tried the Chicago classic which came with pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper, and onions. It was good!!! I definitely want to try the deep dish next time I get the chance!",

    "text": "This pizza is everything. If i could marry it, i probably would. I would give Giordano 5 stars but i have to knock one star down because of the drinks. We ordered a Bellini. It tasted great! But the price was pretty outrageous for the size. The bellini was served in a smaller sized wine glass and the price was $12. Just not worth it. Maybe if we weren't in Vegas, the land of cheap alcohol, it would be worth it. I'm also comparing the value to other restaurants that we ate at while in Vegas. This one just seemed overpriced for the size. For example we ate at a fancy steakhouse later that night and the price was $12 for a cocktail. It was 3 times the size! And this was at a place where the entrees START at $60 a plate.   The pizza though! OMG. I've eaten at Giordanos in Chicago before. It is by far my favorite pizza. I was very excited to see they have a location in Vegas now. We live on the west coast and it's not easy getting to chicago for True deep dish. The cheese, the crust ( i don't know how they get that crunchy bottom with so many fillings and the sauce). Be prepared to wait 45 mins for your pizza. This stuff is made to order. The pizzas are very filling. The small filled both of us plus we took 2 pieces to the hotel. My husband has a rather large appetite, but even he couldn't tackle this one till the end.   Do yourself a favor, stop in here if you like deep dish.",

However, I have to give it a 4.5 because of the seating. Be careful where you sit and make sure you are in a shaded area. We were unlucky and sat in area where the sun was baking us. It made the experience quite sad, but we were fortunate to move which completely salvaged this experience.  Note: We were at Giordanos located in the outdoor plaza.",

    "text": "Being a local, I've generally shied away from eating anywhere on the Strip. I kept seeing things about this Giordano's though. Mostly, pictures of the amazing cheese porn action going on. So the hubs and I decided to give it a try.   We went on a Friday evening around 7pm. There is an inside seating area, but when we arrived we were greeting immediately by the hostess whose stand was right in front of the glass-windowed room where the many chefs were tossing the pizza dough around, loading it up, and throwing it into the ovens. It was really fun to watch. The hostess told us that there would be a 30 minute wait, but that there was also a seating area and bar downstairs in the Grand Bazaar shops. We were starving, so we decided to head down there.   We got downstairs and found plenty of seating at the bar, and there were heat lamps down there to warm us as we waited. We were immediately informed that their signature Chicago deep-dish style pizza would take up to 45 minutes. We decided on the Veggie Pizza and we used that time to sample some of their many beers on tap.   The bartenders were friendly, and made conversation with us as we waited. One of them even let me take a video of him dishing it up for us when it arrived.   This pizza is to die for. We ordered a small, which was big enough for the hubs and I. We could only eat 2 slices, and ended up taking 2 with us to go. We definitely plan on making the trip to the Strip to go back and try some of their other pizzas. Totally worth it! The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because it's on the Strip, and it's always a bit of a hassle trying to find parking there.",

We got our appetizers pretty fast, ordered some garlic Parmesan fries and garlic cheese breadsticks with some ranch and marinara dipping sauce. Both were above average, quality was up to expectations. The server did warn us it might take up to an hour for the pizza, being determined to try the deep dish pizza said that's fine. Due to some error in the kitchen our order didn't go through and we found out 2 hours later after we asked why our order didn't come yet, otherwise I'm guessing it would've taken longer. In the end it was just a bad mistake, they did compensate by making our dinner free but still 2 hours sitting outside waiting for food is never fun. Now about the deep dish pizza, We got one with our own choice of toppings which were pesto chicken, garlic broccoli, mushrooms and spicy jalapenos. An hour wait would've been definitely worth the pizza. I hope they open more branches everywhere for others to try. Pizza was phenomenal!!!",

Secondly the waitress felt it  better to blame myself as the consumer because I didn't realize that they had more than 1 chicken parm, if they have more than one on the menu they should confirm the meal or the sandwich? She got snippy when I asked to confirm what side she put in for me because she didn't ask. The food sucked and I had to send it back. It's not like the place was packed at 11pm on a Wednesday night. It's a shame because you have so many places to eat on the strip where the staff is actually busy and still polite and does their job. Won't be back.",

When we were seated our waiter told us up front that the deep dish pizzas would take 45 minutes, but the thin crust ones would \"be much quicker\". So some of us ordered a thin crust pizza and some ordered other meals. Well the meals came right out but the pizza did. It follow. We were told they took about 35 minutes. Extremely disappointed with that. Those that ordered meals were finished before we even got our pizza. So we waited and then they waited while we ate. Why couldn't they bring all the food at one time? That is my only complaint as the pizza and other dishes were all delicious. Will plan on coming back when I have time to get a deep dish pizza.",

I am from Chicago so I was excited to have something that would remind me of biting into a slice of Lou's pizza. We had no problem finding this place they have a pizza bar downstairs outside, but the main restaurant is located on the second floor of the Bally's shops. If you sit alongside the windows there is a beautiful view outside, if not they have comfortable booths as well. The menu is very basic, we got garlic bread which was a little soggy but it was alright for the most part. The pizza had potential but the crust needs help. It honestly was very flakey like a cheap cracker. Almost tasted like frozen pie crust. Service was good, very attentive and nice staff. Love the atmosphere and the ambiance, lots of potential the pizza just needs a little improvement.",

    "text": "UPDATE:    When I'm wrong I say so...that being said, we recently had the chance to revisit Giordano's and met an outstanding staff that has gotten through the \"grand opening\" growing pains and let me tell you they've done beautifully!  This visit was flawless and I WILL BE BACK over and over again.    Thank you for listening to your clients and making Giordano's an great place to visit! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Our experience started well with a polite waitress, prompt drinks and order.  We were advised that the pizza takes at least an hour to cook which was completely fine and we anticipated that since we have had Chicago style deep dish before.    Then things went down hill quickly.  Our drinks were never refilled without us begging for it, our appetizer took 40 mins to get, we couldn't get silverware and had to ask a different waiter for forks.  He got mad, rolled his eyes, and asked \"WHO IS YOUR WAITER?\"  I replied that if I could find her, I wouldn't be bothering him for forks.  He left and came back 5 minutes later.    The pizza was good but not the best that we've had.  After we finished, we had pizza left over for later and needed a box.  Our waitress reappeared and took the pizza away for boxing and our bill.  That took another 10 minutes.   By this time I was annoyed and told my husband to get a bag from the bartender (our table was right by the bar).  The bartender looked shocked when asked for a bag even though he had just given one to another gentleman that was eating at the bar.  He said he would be right back....yup, another 5 minutes.  In the meantime I asked for a manager and that is when a table near ours told me that they needed the manager next.  They had opened their silverware and the napkin and fork were covered in dried blood.  We saw the silverware and it was indeed blood and it was disgusting.  The manager was very nice and gracious.  She apologized profusely and refunded our money even though we initially declined.  Our waitress came over to apologize and explain that she had been given too many tables in different areas of the restaurant and her concerns were ignored.  I'm not sure if we would give this place another chance.",

    "text": "Food here is always good. Had it in Chicago literally two weeks ago and was obsessed! Since it's in lv and conveniently next to our hotel...we decided to have it again. We were seated immediately and Knew what to order since we were so please with our meal in Chicago. We Ordered half and half and they messed it up (a special and BBQ chicken) .. I had addressed it to our server and he said \"honey I never messed up!!\" Clearly there was no BBQ sauce on my pizza because the whole thing was covered with tomato sauce. Gave him the benefit of the doubt and cut into it.... nope no BBQ sauce. I looked at the menu and it clearly says \"we replace the tomato sauce with BBQ sauce\" he then left to read the menu and came back saying ... \"you ordered a speciality and they don't customize the BBQ pizza\" ummmm ok then why call it BBQ pizza if there isn't BBQ sauce.?? So another server greeted me.. I asked for a manager... our server saw that I was speaking to him and then brought the manager over.. The manager JESSE immediately told me they don't do half and half and instead of being apologetic he just said sorry and walked off. I get it's a new restaurant .. but I didn't wait 45 minutes to get a messed up pizza and be told \"sorry\" .. customer service as a manager is horrible and he needs to get trained better! Even the people next to us asked ... \"they didn't ask to make you a new one??\" Nope.. he offers me a cup of BBQ sauce on the side. Horrible to have him represent as a manager at giordanos .. he does not know customer service. He was rude! Better off having pizza at Grimaldi.. they need to train the staff and Jesse better",

    "text": "I would give zero stars if it allowed me. Let's start by letting everyone know it takes 45 minutes for pizza, which is ok, I am used to Chicago pizza as I am a native. I prefer Lou's but figured it's been years since I have had Giordano's so why not try it and see, plus it wasmy granddaughter's 7th bday and she wanted pizza. So here we are... The hostess upstairs and downstairs never offered for us to pre-order our pizza to cut the time in 1/2, even when the 4 of us were standing there and they could plainly see we had 2 kids with us. We put our name in both locations, so whichever dining area had availability first, we could be sat. You would also think since we did this and explained that we were putting in our name twice, they would offer for us to pre-order. When we recd the text that our table was ready, I asked the hostess if the pre-ordered, she said yes, I stated it would have been nice to know that ahead of time.The mgr. standing at the host stand, questioned me that the host didn't offer it, I stated no, she did not. He apologized and that was that. He could or should have said, if you let me know your order, I can have it rushed, first strike. We ordered our pizza immediately and let the server know we had more of an order but wanted to get the pizza in right away. We then ordered a salad for the table to share and a meatball sandwich since my husband does not like deep dish. I explained that we would like the sandwich with the pizza. At the time of ordering, I also let the server know that it was my granddaughter's bday. She nodded in acknowledgement. The salad was ok, nothing special, just a decent Italian salad, although it did take about 25 minutes for the salad to arrive. A little too long in my opinion.  Our pizza came about an hour later, we never said anything about the salad or pizza's timing as it was a Sat.night, it was busy, we figured we would give them some slack. BUT... we were all finished with our first slice of pizza before my husband recd his sandwich. Let me also let you know that we served the pizza ourselves, I have NEVER been to a deep dish pizzeria where they did not serve you your first slice and my grandkids are little so they eat slow. That is how long it took for the sandwich to arrive.  We questioned the server about it when she finally stopped by the table,she said they just forgot it upstairs and it would be right down, 10 minutes later, I am looking around for the server to see where the sandwich was, and the manager saw me looking around and came over and said the sandwich was on it's way down now. 5 minutes later it arrived. Strike 2  When the server finally came back after the sandwich was delivered, our plates were empty and stacked as we sat there while my husband ate by himself, and then she finally asked how was the food, well not that great but seeing it took over an hour for the pizza and longer for the sandwich we ate it anyways, plus she never stopped by until we were done. Even my grandkids didn't like it, and kids like ALL pizza.  Pizza crust was flavorless, as was the pizza sauce, and there was hardly any sausage or mushrooms on the pizza. Husband said the meatball sandwich was just ok, again nothing special.  The server was not very friendly, more of an order taker, and nothing more, hung out in the room where they get drinks and put in their orders more than she was on the floor taking care of her customers.  We took the pizza with us and gave it to a homeless person, since we were staying in a hotel,but the final strike was that she never did anything for my granddaughters bday and they charged us for the meatball sandwich. By the way the mgr. that came over once to say the sdw was on it's way down right then, but it really wasn't never stopped by again, nor did he apologize for them forgetting to make his sdw as we all know they didn't just forget it upstairs, it was never initially made. Guess I will not try the one in AZ where I live after that experience!!",

Terrible for blind dates (no leaving early) but fun with friends. Just don't come starving like I did.  Pros: - For Chicago-style deep dish pizza, there's no place else. - Appetizers come out lightning and gratefully fast. My friends and I split the sampler. The Mozzarella Triangles were my favorite.  Cons: - Pizza takes forever to come out! - Don't get the 6 inch personal pie! It's about half the height of the regular pies, and takes just as long to cook. And if you're still hungry after like I was, there's no chance of ordering another pie (unless you want to wait another 45 min)  I wish there was a size between the 6\" thin-deep dish and the 12\" for the one vegetarian in the group who didn't want to share in the main pie everyone else was eating.  Still, it's the only place for authentic Chicago pizza in Vegas and for that, I'm a fan!",

    "text": "Once I learned that Giordano's was coming to Las Vegas, Nevada I looked forward to our next trip there. This happened to be last month. My family and I having already experienced real Chicago Deep Dish Pizza at another restaurant in town, wanted to try it where it's talked about all around the world. The restaurant is located in the Bally's Casino area where parking is very limited (try behind the restaurant). So here we went mid July in a 110 degree afternoon. I don't do hot very well but it wasn't too bad until we got to the restaurant. The place was hotter inside than it was outside. Come to find out, on our way out that the AC was out. So as we're walking out, workers could be seen hauling big fans inside.   The hosts were kind and pleasant, seating us fairly quickly. Our waiter was trying to do too much that he couldn't properly serve his tables. We had to ask bus boys for refills and extra napkins constantly. The food was good and worth the wait (the deep dish pizza takes 45-55 minutes to make). Order an appetizer while you wait. I recommend the sampler. Now having said all this, I left there a little disappointed. Being a huge pizza fanatic and connoisseur, I was expecting more from the big name of Giordano's. I was hoping to be knocked off my feet with plenteous flavors but I wasn't. I'm not saying it wasn't good cause it was but I just left wanting more. We'll return on our next visit to Vegas and hope to have a better report. Still love you Giordano's! Check out my pictures.",

    "text": "I was staying at Ballys and when I walked by Giordano's my heart skipped a beat in excitement because I didn't know there was one on this side! I've been to the one in Chicago a couple years ago and definitely needed to eat it again.   We came around 4pm after our pool party and just keep in mind the pizza does take about 30 to 40 minutes to cook. I ordered an appetizer because I was so famished.  I was so hungry I kept asking our waiter Daniel what the ETA of my pizza was. He was patient enough to check an exact time for me multiple times.   When it finally came I dug into my Chicago Classic and downed about 3 slices. I remember when I ate it in Chicago I only had space for one slice. Maybe it was because I was inebriated or I was just really hungry.   The warm cheesy goodness, pepperoni and veggies plus that buttery crust melted in my mouth. I wanted the flavors to never end, but as i split the small with a friend my half was over before I knew it.   Thank you Daniel for keeping me posted !  After the nightclub that evening I wished for more and wish I had leftovers.  So the next morning I tried to call in an order but sadly they weren't open at 10am and I guess it doesn't make sense to as they don't really do breakfast. I didn't have enough time before my bus back to LA to pick up another one sadly. But I shall return ! And it looks like they deliver nation wide !  Drool worthy place I would come back to over and over again",

    "text": "Wasn't all that great, definitely didn't live up to the Instagram hype. I ordered a pepperoni Chicago style deep dish. There was a very thin bottom crust and a very thin layer of pepperoni (the pepperoni was sliced paper thin). There was a huge mound of cheese and a drizzle of sauce. The cheese pull was cool to see but the overall taste in the pizza was lacking. Because the layer of meat and sauce was so thin, all you tasted was cheese! Now let's talk about that-  the cheese cooled very quickly so half way through, you end up with something that tasted more like one of those kiddie cheese sticks. All in all, I probably wouldn't recommend dining on a Chicago pizza here. The taste, the price (23 and some change for a small) and the excruciatingly hour long wait just isn't worth it.",

    "text": "IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHEESE.  My family and I finally ventured out to the strip to check out Giordano's. The restaurant opened about 6 months ago and we have heard great things but have been reluctant to deal with the crowds. Plus, in our experience, a lot of restaurants on the strip have lack luster service compared to those off the strip/Henderson (probably because tourists can be annoying).  Well, I can say that I am glad that we went to Giordano's. On a Monday night (approx 7:30pm), we were able to get a table in less than 10 minutes. The Manager stopped by the table to introduce himself and to tell us a little bit about the restaurant. Our server was very nice, attentive (multiple refills on our beverages arrived before we finished our glasses), and he was up front about the pizza taking about 45 minutes to cook. So we ordered their calamari (and more) appetizer to start (which had calamari, banana peppers, fennel, and lemon slices). It was really good (light/crispy, not greasy) and I am pretty sure that my kids ate some of the peppers and didn't complain.  For our main/dinner, we ordered 2 custom deep dish pizzas, one with pepperoni/mushrooms and one with sausage/mushroom/peppers, and a kids pepperoni (on thin crust). I tried all 3 and Giordano's has the best cheese on any slice of pizza that I have ever had. You can put anything on the pizza but the cheese is the star. The crust is also phenomenal...reminiscent of a saltine but thicker. I also commented to my husband that it would be good with some apple pie filling!  We were so full after that we didn't get a chance to try the desserts but they have canoli and tiramisu, which we will have to try next time - because we will definitely be back!   A+ service and food.",

The lasagna was delicious the first time. They warned us about the delay for the fresh pizza so we came back later when we could wait for about 45 mins to try it. Can even call ahead but we just enjoyed each other's company and drinks while we waited. So worth it! Deep dish, tasty, large and very affordable. And the Greek salad was delicious too!   Will definitely go back and highly recommend!!!",

When the pizzas came out we were excited to pull up a slice of pizza and see the cheese strings stretch....no cheese strings anywhere in sight. Ok, no more pics, let's let that one slide and just eat the pizza. When I bit into the pizza, the tip of it was lukewarm. Now after an hour wait for a fresh pizza pie, it's comes out semi hot?

The hour plus wait is definitely not worth it, the deep dish was \"ehh\". We should of walked out the moment the hostess took us to our booth that was still not cleaned with a broken plate underneath the table.  For $12 you would expect a decent size cocktail, nope you're practically given a tea cup.  Twice i had to get up from my seat to track someone down because we were not given napkins or forks once our food was brought to us. I mean we could have probably just got up and left and our server would have never noticed. We can definitely agree and relate to most of negative reviews this place has. Definitely not going back.",

    "text": "Spent July 2-6 in Las Vegas & decided to try the famous Giordano's for dinner & it did not disappoint. It is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops right by Bally's. When I first saw it nestled among these \"outdoor\" shops, I was concerned because it looked like it was just a covered eating area/bar that was still open to the outside air. It was 110 degrees most days & I was concerned about sitting there sweating for the next hour, especially when their average wait time for a Chicago deep dish is 45 minutes. I quickly realized that this Giordano's outside area isn't the only option. I walked past this area to the back & went up the escalator towards Bally's. At the top of the escalator is the entrance into a very nice indoor Giordano's seating area that overlooks the strip. When I approached the hostess, she informed me of the time it takes to make a Chicago deep dish & gave me the option of pre-ordering it. I pre-ordered a medium pizza & she placed me on the list & told me I'd receive a text message when my table was ready. I went back down the escalator into the Grand Bazaar Shops & sat at the Sin City Brewing Company's bar to try a few pints, while my wife and daughter explored the various shops.  After about 40 minutes, I received a text to head back up. We were promptly seated, ordered & received our drinks, & then our pizza arrived 5 minutes later. I was very impressed with their system & found it REALLY convenient. I can't wait to go back!",

As with all deep dish pizza joints here's about a 45 min wait so expecting that on the way in the pizza came right on time. The crust was perfect and the flavor of the pizza was identical to the Chicago Iocation. If you haven't tried Chicago deep dish pizza or you've been to the one in Chicago stop by and you will not be disappointed.",

The beers came and no water. Waited and waited again. My boyfriend had to go ask for the water. The waiter kept ignoring us while serving food and drinks to table next to us even tho they arrived after us. Food finally came after 50 minites of waiting. And never did get the appetizer. We were not charged for it. Pizza was served with no napkins and again boyfriend had to go up to bar to ask for napkins. I rated this a 2 stars for okay food but service sucked big time!!!",

Their deep dish pizza was recommended to us as to what they're most known for. We picked the sausage \"speciality\" pizza. It is HUGE.. it looks practically like a pie or cake! It was too big to finish, even at a small size, for 2 people. It is definitely rather cheesy - you can film or take a photo of yourself doing a \"pull\" of it. As to how it tastes though? So disappointing. It is so bland - what am I even tasting? It was like a sea of pasta sauce, just too much sauce and not enough of the other ingredients. Their calamari was thankfully better. The fried lemons in it is interesting.",

We had a simple order of a small cheese pizza and two sodas. After waiting over 40 minutes, we asked someone to please check on our pizza.  We were told that it takes 30 to 45 minutes.  I am perfectly happy to wait for a great pizza but then our pizza did arrive 10 minutes later it was room temperature and clearly looked as of it had been waiting a while.  Sadly we we were so hungry...we ate it anyway. :( I would not recommend sitting in the out door area as there is a serious lag time between when your food is made and when it is served to you; even on the simplest of orders.  The food is brought over by food runners and apparently it has a tendency to sit for a while like it is waiting for the next street.  My partner, who is a die heart  pizza fan states he has eaten at this place inside the actual restaurant and did not have a problem.  I really do think it is a problem with the outside bar.  Drinks yes.  Food no.",

To me personally he is one of the best servers I have ever had. He definitely made our dining experience here better. Our pizza which we were told would be 45-55 mins was on time. We ordered the mozzarella triangles and chicken tenders as starters and they were delicious. We also ordered the deep dish meat and more pizza and was fantastic. If yances boss's read this give this guy a raise because he was funny as hell. Keep up the good work",

Bit of advice.  Wait for pizza to cool off before eating.  Once it solidifies, you can eat it like regular pizza. Otherwise it will be very messy, and you'll have to eat it with w fork and knife.  So much pizza, but absolutely amazing.  By far best deep dish.  Great location in middle of strip too with views of strip outside of ballys",

    "text": "Where do I begin. Maybe I had too high of expectations for this place, but at every point I felt disappointed and let down. First off, we are in VEGAS. In 100 degree plus weather. And they only had OUTSIDE seating. They get effort points for having it covered, and having misters, but the mist was mostly towards the ceiling and unfortunately did not do enough to counter the heat.  They were very good about bringing us water, which was vital, since we were sitting in the heat for  an HOUR and a half.  Let me repeat. We were sitting there for an HOUR AND A HALF. They tell you to expect a 45 minute wait to cook your pizza. We waited TWICE as long for our pizza. And when it finally did arrive, all I could taste was salt. The cheese was salty. The sauce was salty. The crust was salty, and obviously the pepperoni was salty. The only thing not salty was the pineapple bits, sprinkled sparingly around the pie. I couldn't even manage to eat one slice. Maybe it was the heat, but my body started to revolt after salty bite #2.  I brought my leftovers home and will attempt to eat some again after I know I don't have heat stroke and stomach hunger cramps from an epically long wait.  If you're going to eat here, definitely take it to go. And hopefully you like salt.",

The reviews basically warned me about the long wait, so we were prepared for that and ordered a couple of beers and appetizers while we waited for the pizza. The cheesy bread and wings were delicious. The cheesy bread was free since I signed up for their emails. Totally recommend doing that. We ordered the Chicago classic, and it wasn't as cheesy as I expected. I wanted the crazy cheese pull and I didn't get it. That was a bit disappointing. It was one of the main reasons we wanted to try it, we're cheese fanatics. The pizza itself was good though. It had great flavor and was very filling. Our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs though because we ordered a large for 2 of us, even though our nice waiter told us a medium would be enough. Haha, we should've listened. That large pizza lasted for 3 meals, lol. It was a lot. We may go back when we visit Vegas again, and hopefully I'll get my cheese pull.",

All the key ingredients are there, freshly made mozzarella, zesty sauce made from red ripe tomatoes, meaty pepperoni and Italian sausage--oh and that heavenly buttery thick pie-like crust baked perfectly! The scenic location at the heart of the Vegas Strip (Grand Bazaar Shops at Bally's) plus the accommodating staff makes this place our de facto restaurant to take visiting guests for a taste of Chicago with that Las Vegas flair. Their signature \"cheese pull\" presentation is a delight to watch and an omen of the delicious meal you're about to devour. Do order your deep dish well ahead as your server will kindly warn you it takes 45-minutes to prepare the pizza since everything is made fresh to order. This is the perfect time to indulge their calamari appetizers--golden crispy bites with breaded and fried thinly sliced lemons to balance the rich taste!",

The restaurant was clean, well lit, and spaced comfortably  (I walk with a cane and had no problems navigating through the dining room) for me. I haven't been here before, but my wife has been to one in Chicago so we knew what to expect as far as the wait for the pizza. You should expect at least 45 minutes for the pizza from the time you place your order.   We tried the appetizer sampler while we waited and it was fantastic. When we finally got our pizza it was exactly what we ordered and it was delicious. We got Chicago style deep dish \"meat and more\". There were two of us so we got the small pie and still had 2 pieces to take home.",

I was told it was because of a system error so I wasn't too upset. We were told to wait 20 minutes, and we did not receive our food for half an hour. When we got our food, it was only half of our order. When we received the other half of the order, our sauce was missing. She then asked if we needed plates and forks, which we said yes to.  By the time we got back, we realized that we were NOT given forks. Which wouldn't be too big of a deal but we got a salad. Am I supposed to eat it with my hands? Our dressing was also missing. I'm very disappointed with the service here. I will NEVER come back.",

It takes 45min to cook. The menu says that, the wait staff tells you that, and there are signs everywhere. So don't complain about the wait. Your fault for not reading or listening.   I had a slice of the deep dish cheese, pepperoni, and spicy sausage. I did not care for the sausage. The pepperoni was fine, and there is CHEESE people! I felt like it was too much. That's just my preference. I only had the 1 slice and didn't finish it. It was just too thick for me. Smelled great tho.   Bathrooms were nasty. Toilet paper and water all over the place; and it smelled to high heaven. It was horrible.   Atmosphere is cool. The restaurant is elevated so you can see the strip very well. Was nice.   I ordered a virgin daiquiri because I have liver issues and can't drink...pretty sure my drink had alcohol in it. I didn't really taste alcohol, but I felt buzzed after I drank it. And since I don't drink, 1 drink would easily get me buzzed. That was a little disappointing.  Our server was super cool. I'd go back someday but I'd order a regular pizza or a personal size. Maybe even try one of their pasta dishes. I just couldn't handle the pizza-cake. Can't believe I'm saying this...just too much cheese!",

We ordered the appetizer sampler which included fried mozzarella, boneless chicken, bruschetta, and cheesy bread. Everything was delicious!! Our pizza came out roughly a half hour later. We ordered a small meat and more meat deep dish. It was very good, even though I didn't find as much meat as I was expecting. It was a lot of food though!!",

The service was kinda lacking though which is why I took some stars off. I had to ask for my refills and they never really checked in on me after my app was done. They did tell me the pizza takes 45 mins to cook. But I needed more soda a few times. I wish they check on you more if the pizza takes 45 mins. I think this would be a great place for families because of the amount of food you get. The portions are very large. We got the app combo and the small deep dish with chicken sausage, green peppers. We had 4 slices left after we were done eating. So much food. I loved how the Bellagio fountains were right in view. The water show can be seen from the tables and we were by the window so it was great. Overall i might go back with group and not just 2 people.",

The reason why I'm giving the 1 star is simply because they undercooked our pizza. At first I didn't think anything of my semi-raw mushroom, but after finishing half of our small pizza, I noticed right before boxing it up that there was a piece sausage that was clearly still RAW (As seen in my photo). Luckily I only had one slice and felt fine, but my bf DID get the runs that night. Not cool. Didn't want to make a scene so we just left. Just please make sure your pizzas are cooked all the way through !!!",

Giordanos is truly so filling! I truly as good as I've always had it and gave me a serious case of the iris. It's definitely worth sharing with someone. I could barely get through two slices before feeling like I was going to explode. We ordered \"the special pizza\". It was packed with flavors and toppings that was rich in taste. I say get the deep dish if you don't mind having a cheat meal. They do have a thin crust option but I say you can't find a Chicago style deep dish at many places so when you can, do it! It's totally worth every calorie in my opinion!  I wish they had this restaurant in Dallas!",

(such a hospitable gentleman). truly a memorable experience worth returning again and again!   my guest and i had the best seat in the house but i'll let you be the judge of that! michael opened up this unique garage style wall in the middle of the restaurant for a refreshing outdoor experience indoors over looking the bazaar shops. #score  what we ordered:  appetizers *caesar salad *calamari *garlic parmesan fries   *the main event: cheese deep dish pizza w/spinach (half mushrooms & chicken for the carnivores)   did i mention garlic? i will never order again without requesting garlic. the fresh garlic complimented the pizza and sauce so well (your welcome in advance)  dessert was a short debate! tiramisu & chocolate cake were delish trust me i had both...!!!!  overall i'd definitely return",

Drinks are strong and atmosphere was fun down on the patio. Definitely check out if you're in Vegas and can't make it to Chicago. They also ship their pies which we are about to take advantage of!! Unbelievably tasty red sauce!!",

I had the vegetarian lasagna with the Alfredo sauce and a side salad. The portions were reasonable. I found that the food tasted pretty generic. I was not impressed with the quality to price ratio.",

    "text": "Just had the privilege of experiencing their soft opening. It was everything we hoped for and expected! The food was top notch, the service was quick & efficient, and the atmosphere was really fun. We were seated at their downstairs bar, and enjoyed the people watching, with football on their TVs. 8 total, I think? Upon greeting, the server was quick to remind us that the deep dish takes awhile, so while we browsed the beer list, he put our pizza order in. Decent beer list, could definitely use more craft! I was impressed they do carry one from a local brewery, Crafthaus. Drink local! I work for another local one. We ended up with two Stone Ruination IPAs. Great prices on the drinks, for Strip standards. For our appetizer, we went with the cheesy bread, which was pretty good! I wanted the wings, but the mister really wanted that bread. The blend of cheeses was really nice, with a tangy marinara on the side. I'll pass on the extra carbs next time, though, after eating that pizza... which leads me.... That deep dish pie... oh my... we kept it simple with just sausage, as we wanted to experience the flavor of the sauce, cheese and crust. It was mouthwateringly delicious. My husband is from Chicago, and he honestly got a little emotional after first bite lol. Finally great pizza in Vegas! They have a system in place to filter their water so it's just like the h2o they have in Chicago, to ensure the same flavors as the original. You can definitely tell, it's authentic, according to my hubby. I can't wait for the leftovers already, even though I'm still stuffed. Only slight bummer.. We really wanted the cannolis for dessert, but they ran out. It's ok, though, they're still getting their wings ready to fly. The tiramisu was a wonderful substitute. Would order again. The staff were all very friendly, not just to their tables, and management made their friendly presence known. They were all on it! This place will be a hit. Can't wait to come back and check out the upstairs portion of the restaurant. Thanks for letting us be a part of your stress test! I work next door, and will definitely be patronizing this place often! Peace, beer, and pizza!",

They have an outside patio area with a large number of seats, and then the main restaurant is on the next level up.  We ordered salad, and appetizer sampler, and a deep dish pizza. Service was good, the inside dining room wasn't very busy when we were there. We did complain that it was a little warm and they opened up a garage door type window near our seats and we cooled down nicely after that. The salad and appetizer came out in decent time, and we knew that we'd have to wait around 45 minutes for the deep dish pizza (the menu is very clear about that). They also offer thin crust pizza but we went for the deep dish. Overall, the food was good and we thought the menu prices were very reasonable for a Strip restaurant (our pizza was $17 and could easily feed 3 people). This is a nice addition to the area and next time we're in Vegas we will visit again.",

    "text": "If anyone was excited about Giordano's coming to Vegas it is me. Grew up on Giordano's in Chicago, in high school it was our place to go on Fridays. So when my husband decided to surprise me and take me here I was super happy. But that happiness faded quickly. We waited a good 10 minutes before our waiter greeted us. It was like pulling teeth to ask for a cup of ice for our ice teas. We put in our order 1st, deep dish pizza. The pizza came after 45 minutes (which is normal) I'm waiting for the the first slice to be served to me and he walked away from the table, SMH thats part of the experience. So I served my family (that never had this amazing pizza before) my kids loved it. I dug in and it was soooooo good taste wise but it wasn't hot, it was just warm. Waited all that time for a warm pizza, pretty disappointed. I just wanted to leave. I was waiting at the bar and the manager happened to be there, he asked how everything was and I explained to him of my disappointment. He was great and offered a free pizza on my next time down (since I am local) So hopefully when I go back the service will be better. But as for this review 1 star for the taste of the pizza and another star for the customer service from the manager.",

Ultimately  the waiter was great and the district director as well, who came over and personally made sure we were happy.  They have some teething issues to work out with the menu and the volume (it's quite loud with no sound breaks). But it has a great view of the Bellagio dancing waters. The service and ambiance are spot on, just need to get the menu dialed in, then all will be well. 4 stars is much but 3 was too low..... 3.5 for me.",

    "text": "I'm originally from Chicago, so naturally my level of disappointment in pizza here in Las Vegas is rather high. I was driving down Flamingo one night when I saw the Giordano's sign at the Bazaar shops at Bally's, and was extremely excited. Giordano's is not my favorite Chicago pizza by a long shot (though it is my dad's and I have it at least once every time I visit him), but when you want Chicago pizza, you take what you can get.   I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner because he wanted to try deep dish. Most Chicagoans that I know are not huge fans of deep dish; it's just kind of a Chicago cliche. Again, I wanted a taste of home, and he wanted deep dish, so we both lucked out.   The wait for a table was about 45 min, so we opted to sit at the bar instead (we actually prefer it in most restaurants). Our bartender was fantastic and friendly, and had our order in fast. We shared a Harvest Greens salad, and of course had our deep dish with sausage, spinach and mushrooms. Pizza was perfect, and the salad was really flavorful.  Overall it was a great experience, and will definitely satisfy my cravings for pizza when I can't get to Chicago.",

I had the veggie pie, and even my wife loved it, and she's not that big of a cheese person overall. Great experience and fun to experience in Las Vegas. A bit hard to find but you go upstairs and can get picked up from Uber or lyft right downstairs. The only downside was that the box got soggy at the bottom since we were takeout but that's probably more our fault for taking longer to pickup. Granted a wax paper at the bottom or waiting to place into the to go box would have helped. Would definitely get again - lasted us a good 2 days",

That being said, now you have a basis for my review. It was...good but not great. The sauce wasnt as good as back home and the cheese wasn't as cheesy, like when u pick up a slice the cheese doesn't just stretch and run like a run on sentence. It just broke off, like it was reheated pizza not freshly baked. Maybe I got unlucky. I don't know. I may try it again my next visit. Or it may be back to ordering from home.",

I was sat instantly and the wait wasn't nearly as long as any of the locations in Chicago. Service was fast to begin with but slow by the end of the night. I ordered the personal deep dish pepperoni and pineapple along with an Arnold Palmer. The pizza tasted just like the ones in Chicago. It was delicious and full of pepperoni and pineapple and cheese. For dessert I had the three cannolis. They were amazing and freshly made. Being in Las Vegas I thought the prices would be higher but they were very similar in price to the Chicago locations and I think even cheaper. I'm excited that I know longer have to go to Chicago to get this amazing pizza. Can't wait to be back!!!! Five stars on this one.",

The crust was perfectly baked and nice and crunchy. The Italian beef sandwich was nice and spicy just like a good Italian beef should be. The bread held up to the sandwich which is always good and was flavorful all by itself. Added a nice touch to the sandwich. I'd eat here again for sure.

I had to giggle because it's up to the waiter or waitress to make sure they serve you that first piece of pizza showing you how much cheese there is and how much stretch. Definitely feels you up. If you get a chance I would at least try it. It is a little spend he, but you'll always have extras to take home. We tried the deep-fried cheese curds and those were really good too!",

What a surprise awaited us!  Our son is a pizza aficionado and ordered and enjoyed a personalized, piping hot, chicago-style deep dish pizza.    The buildout is 2d floor with very tall ceilings, and a sweeping view of the Bellagio from a distance.  The interior is basically Chicago style pizza joint, tables and a nice sports bar feel, with a huge Las Vegas Knights hockey jersey adorning the wall.  Our appetizers were great and basic--mozzarella, calamari and a variety plate--all were superb.    We had a great waiter who was great.  Service was 100% a plus here.  While my son had the pizza, i ordered chicago/italian style meatballs which arrived piping hot with mozzarella cheese and nice red sauce.  It was great!  This is not gourmet food, but it is great food!",

I love the tanginess of the marinara that tops off the pizza.  I can only eat a slice.  My big guy can eat 2-3 slices.  There are always leftovers for our next day perfect breakfast experience..

    "text": "We've been to the Giordano's in Chicago and thought the deep dish pizza was amazing, so on our recent trip to Vegas we brought our kids to their Vegas location on the strip.  Here, Giordano's is split up into two buildings.  On the ground, there's a covered \"outdoor\" section.  It's encased in glass with large openings so you can enjoy the fresh air.  There are plenty of tables and a long bar area, which is great if you just want a slice and a beer or cocktail.  Behind this are is a large building where Giordano's is on the top, second floor.  There is an escalator (and elevator) to get up there.  Inside, it's another bar and lots of seating along the windows and booths in the back.  We opted for a booth.  It was happy hour time, but our server informed us happy hour was \"only at the bar\".  Visibly bummed, he said he would talk to his manager, who agreed to allow us to enjoy the happy hour specials even in our booth.  We got a couple of beers  ($8-9 each) and the chicken bites appetizer ($12.95), all half-off normal price.  We also ordered a medium Chicago Classic deep dish pizza (pepperoni, onions & green peppers).  Even with a medium, this is a BIG pizza.  This is truly DEEP dish pizza.  It took roughly 45 min (which our server mentioned it would).  This is a long time so be prepared to drink a couple of brews, or have something to do while you wait.  I wonder if they have \"call ahead\" service?   Might be worth asking if you're planning on eating here.  Overall the pizza was great.  A little pricey for everything but we saved $18 coming during happy hour time.  There's a million pizza places in Vegas, but this is probably the only place to offer an authentic DEEP DISH pizza, just like the real deal back in Chicago ;-)",

So after picking the pizza up and heading back to the pool, this pizza was filled with cheese!! A cheese lovers dream. The taste was out of this world amazing. It's pretty big so you would only need one slice. I got a large and it came to about $30 or so but it's well worth it. Can't wait to get another so time.",

Loved everything about this pizza! Takes a lot to fill me up but this personal deep dish was enough for me.   My gf got the lasagna with beef and it was pretty disappointing. No flavor. At all. Did not expect this from Giordanos. The cheese was good and the noodles were cooked well but it's really lacking in flavor. Never again.  I definitely recommend coming here though for the pizza! The service was good as well.",

    "text": "OMG best deep dish ever! Where have you been all my life? Ordered online through Yelp; as a carry out and picked it up to enjoy back at the resort. The thick cheesy layers of goodness combined with pepperoni, meatballs, and Giardiniera Peppers goes so well with the marinara sauce. The crust was crispy and buttery even after reheating. Like eating a True pizza pie! Ordered the chicken chopped salad. It was tasty as well. They were thoughtful enough to even include a pizza server, plates,forks,napkins,ect. Please bring a new location to So. Cal.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located right next to Bally's & has two sections to it - an outdoor lower area in the shopping area, & an indoor upper level area, both with plenty of seating.  We came with a large party of 12 around 11am on a Saturday. It was almost 100 degrees so like rational people we elected to sit in the indoor air conditioned section upstairs. There wasn't much people but it still took about 10 minutes to get seated.  Once we got seated however, the place started to fill up pretty & got pretty bustling quickly. Our service was good & the waiters were easy to catch the attention of whenever we had any questions. We ordered 2 medium sized deep dishes as well as 2 large pitchers of margaritas.  Honestly, the pizza was just OK. The deep dish slices were good, but not good enough for the hour-long wait it took for it to come out. For our party of 12, 2 medium pizzas are enough to give each person 2 slices, which was enough in my opinion (especially if you're planning on drinking throughout during the day like your typical Vegas partygoer). The margaritas however, were top notch. The flavors we got - strawberry & mango - were both pretty sweet, refreshing, & strong enough to keep us busy for almost an hour until our food came out.  Personally, I'm not a fan of deep dish, but this restaurant is in a pretty convenient location on the strip. So if deep dish is your jam & you can stomach the wait time, this place would probably be worth checking out.",

People have been raving about how good it is and I only have 2 places to compare it to: Tony's Little Italy and Rance's. They are both delicious in their own ways. That cheese pull though... mmmmm  I ordered online and got a 10% off code! They quoted 45 minutes so I got there in an hour... I had to wait another 20 mins... in the cold... they didn't have a reason for the delay. The cashier was more concerned with small talk with her coworker than service. Oh well.  The pizza itself was delicious! Came out crispy and piping hot! I got the valentine special pizza... which came heart-shaped...!!! So adorable!   I got half jalapeno and meatball and half garlic broccoli and pepperoni. The toppings were in the bottom layer (except for the jalapenos) then the cheese and marinara sauce was on the top. The cheese pull was soooo satisfying. The crust was crispy and not soggy at all. It had a perfect balance between toppings, breading and cheese.  -1 Star for the service and the excessive wait but the pizza was too-notch!",

We showed up around lunch time, but it wasn't that crowded. Nonetheless, our pizza took forever to come out. Several tables around us were eagerly waiting for their food also. Service here could use some work.   We opted for the Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza. After waiting awhile for our pizza to come out, we were disappointed since the pizza was a little cold and wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Perhaps if it were actually hot, it would've tasted better.  I was a little underwhelmed by the overall quality of the food. Judging from other reviews, it sounds like the taste here is different than the original location in Chicago. I can't wait to try that location.",

I really liked the vibe, it's super cute inside and the staff was extremely friendly. It does take almost an hour for the pizza to be made but they warned us of that ahead of time and I actually think it wasn't too long of a wait.  The restaurant is on the strip so of course parking is tricky. It's located in a super good spot though so you can walk around before and after dinner easily!!!  Vegetarian friendly!",

We were told they save the booths for bigger parties and there was just two of us! Pizza came out barely warm. We notified our waiter Jhon ..and he was very accommodating and took it back to the kitchen to reheat it.. results were charred crust when it was returned!!! Keep in mind it was a small deep dish for $25.00 dollars. Also irritating was that all of the booths remained open and they never sat anyone there the entire time we were in there. You can see there were not many customers.  The Wedge Salad was not a wedge but flat leaf lettuce with a drizzle of dressing.   So the good with the bad...the salad was tasty..and the pizza was yummy. However, when reasonable service accommodations are refused we don't return.",

We ordered a choose your own topping pizza adding onion, jalapenos, bell pepper and olives. We were told there would be a 45 min wait, which was absolutely fine by us. We ordered cheese garlic breads to make sure we aren't hungry and a glass of coke for my spouse. The cheese pizza was out in 15 mins, the cheese was yummy - garlic bread was fresh.  The disappointment started with the pizza which was the highlight of the meal. Soggy base, I could feel the softness, and this was after waiting for 45 mins. Our pizza was switched and we were served veggie pizza with broccoli and mushroom which my spouse and I absolutely dislike. They got the right order after 15 mins by then we were halfway through the food and hungry - it was already 1 hr, 15 mins since we waited.  Bill, of course we were charged for the veggie pizza which we didn't order and also charged $4.95 for the coke container! I don't mind paying, but let me know!!! Not happy- not worth my money and time.",

I did however manage to eat at one accidentally while walking through Las Vegas though! My girlfriend and I were roaming around the Paris/Bally's area on Thursday and got pretty hungry. This location was located outside in the middle of everything and offered a bunch of cool seating. The menu here is famous for Chicago deep dish pizza, but also features thin crust pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and what I ordered,  a piadini! What is a piadini you ask?  It's basically a wrap that uses pizza dough instead of an actual wrap. I ordered a chicken caprese piadini and it was absolutely delicious! The dough was fantastic and made the wrap so much better to eat, along with the chicken inside being tasty as well. On the side I got a small cup of minestrone soup that also gets a big thumbs up for me, it was very tasty and very hot as well.   Giordanos gave me great food, had excellent service, and was outside which made it even cooler. This is definitely a fantastic place to stop and eat on the strip!",

The only reason to come here is for the deep-dish Chicago style pizza.   45 mins to bake (you can call in to order to go for a shorter wait time), the pizza is loaded with cheese and a high thick crust. Where are the ingredients, you may ask? Baked right into the pizza, so that every bite ensures you get the flavor profile you are expecting.

    "text": "Let's be clear, there is absolutely no shortage of good pizza in Las Vegas, let alone the strip, though there really isn't much by way of deep dish. With that being said, I love deep dish pizza! From the crispy edged and soft interior of there crust, to the \"I won't be able to sh*t for a week\" amount of cheese, there's nothing quite like it. Giordano's delivers on all fronts.   Located in the new-ish Grand Bazaar Shops across from Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, the upstairs, much like the downstairs, is a cavernous window filled space. This means that there's lots of seating and not tom long of a wait. When there is a wait, rest assured there's a full bar to belly-up and order a cocktail or 2. On our recent visit we waiting about 10 minutes, certainly enough time to enjoy a drink and a view off the energy outside.   Service is friendly, though our server was a little out of it forgetting to bring us plates, utensils etc. At one point I had to order a bottle of wine from the bar when our server disappeared without a trace, mind you it wasn't that busy. Anyhoo, the food made up for the lack of service, which was brought out hot and fresh by another staff member.  Below is what we ended up sharing between the 4 of us. I will say that 2 large pizzas was even too much for these big bears, we had plenty of pizza leftovers for breakfast the next day (all by my plan).   Round 1: Fried Mozzarella Triangles - Yes, fried cheese triangles, so light ands crisp, I wish they put these on a pizza.  Italian Wedge Salad - Calling this a wedge is a stretch. It's more like several leaves of romaine, stack on top of themselves with all of the toppings (cheese, tomato, etc) all on one leaf. Impossible to share without making a mess. Next time we'll stick to chopped salads as those are easier to share.  Round 2: The Special Deep Dish Pizza - The sauce was well balanced with a nice sweetness, underneath laid the glorious cheese layer. So much stringy delightful cheese, veggies and delicious sausage. A pan full of love I'll tell ya!  Sausage Thin Crust - I love eating pizza that has been cut into squares. The cheese was nicely baked and cartelized while the pepperoni was just right. The majority of the table preferred this one over the deep dish, weird.   As we waddled to the cab stand over at Bally's, we all agreed, what a deliciously, satisfying gut bomb. Now where are the laxatives?",

There is also a smaller outdoor restaurant in the Pavilion area. It is almost set like an outdoor bar, but they actually serve the same food there that they do inside the restaurant. If you go a couple feet behind this patio area, the actual restaurant is up the stairs to your left.  We did call to see if there was a wait around dinner time, but there was not. We requested a table of four by the window, as we wanted to overlook the city. It took a few minutes to get the table ready, but it was not long at all.  Know that it is deep dish pizza, so it does take a long time to cook. Took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and the server warned us that that would happen due to the style of the pizza. We ended up getting a small deep dish, as we were not that hungry. It did feed the four of us with 1 to 2 slices each, but if we had to do it over, we would have just gotten the larger size of a medium as we were still a bit hungry after.  So good! They are known for their pizza--so if you are craving pizza, check them out! It's worth it!",

    "text": "Giordanos's truly a Chicago favorite loved by pizza lovers nation wide. Chicago is known for its great pizza especially deep dish and Giordano's is a hallmark of that greatness. Giordano's is a special kind of pizza you can only find in the chi town right? I mean come on the last time I went there it was a gorgeous day on the strip with ma.......Wait a second......The Strip????? This cant be possible!!!! NO NO this place is not real OMG when I go back home to Illinois I am going to get beat up is the streets!!! Please if your reading this it is my final review!!!!!!  Though its not located in my favorite city in America Chicago this Giordano's is pretty amazing. The setting maybe different but it still had that bold and delicious Chicago flavor. The two apetizers I started off with were great and very satisfying. The first appetizer I had was the calamari and more $10.95 this dish had fried pieces of calamari such as the tentacles as well as fried green beans,lemon rings, shaved fennel, with a very fresh and tomatoy marinara sauce. Then I moved onto the most amazing tomato Bruscheta $9.25 This plate had fresh tomatos mozzarela ccheese basil,olive oil, balsamic glaze, all served on a crispy garlic toast. The tomatos were so fresh I almost asked if they were freshly picked.   Then after a 45 minute wait(WHY YOU TORTURE ME WITH WAIT GIORDANOS!?!?!?!?!!?!?) a gift from god himself was delivered to my table. The deep dish chicken sasuage deluxe $28.25 for a medium which was tottaly worth the price. This pizza came packing with nicley portioned chicken sausage,spinach, and mushrooms all packed together for an amazing bite. The crust was cracker thin just like it should....AAAAAH it felt like I was on top of the Willis Tower at night with a cool breeze blowing.  Though the food was great the outlet itself could have been a bit better. The atmosphere was great with the whole restaurant being open and it had water spritzer just in case it got hot. The table were nice and the plates could have been a bit cleaner my had tons of battle scars it had seen a few forks in its time. The location was ok(not known for the most sober patrons) but I think Giordanos could thrive in someplace more upbeat and lively such as Dowtown Summerlin. Truly it could have had more of a Chicago deel with decorations and could have even played blues brothers music instead of 107.9. The service was great the waitress I had and the other staff had excellent customer service skills.   Chicago it is truly a wonderful city and the home of the original Giordano's. Who would ever guess that I would find a nice tastey slice of home right here in Vegas.  This is your favorite Yelper! Rodney...Where shall my taste buds take me next.",

The atmosphere was fun, the staff were attentive and informed us that the pizza would take a minute  because the pizza is cooked  fresh. The pizza was way well worth the wait.  We will definitely visit this place again. Also, we plan to ship this pizza to our house in Tennessee & to our daughter in Brooklyn, NYC.",

My bf, friend, and I went to the Bodies Exhibit while we waited for the pizza. I can still remember the cheesiness of the pizza...how fluffy the pizza dough was....how meaty the pizza was....how saucy the pizza was... So good! I got full with 1 slice. Lol. I ended up taking the pizza with me on the plane back home and I practically guarded the pizza with my life. I wish there was a Giordano's here in Washington! Can't wait to go back again!",

My mother and I got thin crust pepperoni and cheese pizza, and while the cheese, sauce, and pepperoni were very scrumptious, the crust closely resembled cardboard. So much so that it's cardboard taste overwhelmed the outstanding flavors of the toppings. We give the pizza a 6/10. I would also like to add that the deep dish pizza looks absolutely disgusting and we were not quite sure how so many people around us were consuming it. To finish it off, the service was just okay. For an example, they brought us our main dish before our appetizer.",

Paying in Canadian $, Las Vegas is expensive but we found this place reasonable (for Las Vegas) and the food tasty. We had the thin crust pizza with a bottle of red wine and a Caesar salad. We had briefly thought about the deep dish but the previous reviews said it takes an hour and that would have meant another bottle of wine. Also, it looked good but would probably feed 4. Anyway, it was our best meal of the trip and we would try it again.",

    "text": "Flavors and configuration are, for the most part, legit Chicago pie.  HOWEVER... be judicious about toppings; more is not better.  AVOID the \"Chicago Special\" pre-configured selection, as the ratio of vegetables to sausage is serious overkill; we could barely notice the sausage 'wads' amongst the sea of bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Plus, those vegetables have a lot of inherent water content, which releases when cooked.  This ended up sogging out our crust, which meant scooping up pieces of wet cardboard with our slices (see pic).  Lastly, this location should purchase enough pie pans to keep them on the table while serving. That is what they do in Chi-town, and it helps keep the pie warmer, longer.",

The Greek salad was also delicious.  The environment was dim, nice wood tables, and Chicago swag everywhere! Very attentive staff! Will come again!",

Our server brought our food out and NEVER, not one time, did he come back and check on us to see if we needed anything .. (you know like napkins, water refills, the  basic dine in items). The restaurant was busy but not too crowded where the food server couldn't check on us .. last thing, the pizza could have been a little hotter.

We got to Giordano's around 9pm and thought we were in luck and avoided the dinner crowd. We were seated right away and it took a few minutes to get a waiter but my wife and I were patient as we always are. Finally, Robert comes by to help us out. He takes our orders and he was nice enough to inform us that the deep dish pizzas were going to take about 1 hour to make so we opted for a meatball sandwich which he said would be speedy, a side salad and some garlic bread. Easy right? Well fast forward 40 minutes later, we were still waiting on our food. Robert came by a few time, he told us our food was on the way, the next time he came by he said that we would be getting a discount on our bill because of the wait. We sat patiently, we didn't complain. But by 45 minutes we had not received anything, not even a side salad which doesn't take any time at all to cook, grill or boil. I was completely done by then. We couldn't find Robert any longer so we quietly got up, went to the hostess and let her know that we will be leaving.  It's kind of ridiculous if you think about it. We wasted 45 minutes of our time sipping on tap waters expecting a full meal. I'm very disappointed in this experience and I will not be coming back here.",

    "text": "Who could go wrong with Giordano's? If you have not visited then it's a must when you're in Vegas or Chicago. I was very excited when I learned that the new Vegas location was opened right by Ballys. They have non-pizza options such as spaghetti, your traditional pizzas, calamari, cheesy bread, and their famous deep dish pizza. They have a carry out window at this location which I find super convenient for Vegas. You can call from your hotel room and go down and get your order. The deep dish pizzas are amazing, so filling. I'm a big eater and a small pizza will feed 2 with left overs. This time I ordered the pepperoni deep dish and it was great. It's made to order so it does take a long time, don't expect to be in and out because it's a while. However, well worth the wait. Service was excellent. We were seated right away and the servers were very attentive. Wish I had a Giordano's closer.",

The waitress kinda explained to us about how the pizza cook time works (45 minutes to an hour) which we understood. So we put our order in for a medium stuffed deep dish and waited. She was very nice in keeping us updated on how far along our pizza was coming, and refilled our water regularly. When it finally came to our table, it wasn't hot. At all. It wasn't even warm. The onions were raw and cut into huge pieces (is that the Chicago way?). We ate it anyway because we had waited for so long. I would probably recommend to just get the grab and go downstairs or get the frozen pizza you can just cook at your home. At least then you know you will be getting a hot pizza.",

And then when we wanted to pre-order our pizza because we know that's a possibility and will save a ton of time (hint: order your pizza while you are waiting because it takes 45 min to cook) the hoestess taking our order acted like we were dumb for wanting to order ahead. I wanted to complain to the manager but our server was never around long enough for us to ask him for anything. He never even refilled our drinks. Food is decent, it's no Chicago Giordanos, but I'll take it. They just need to work on their service.",

NOW I DON'T KNOW HER ROLE HERE But, to be a leader of a team you should take the initiative  and help she hasn't checked anyone to a seat she has been twiddling her thumbs our waiter is a freaking boss he is getting Hella stuff done he is running when people need help he was on it I came up and asked him he apologized he said he was going to make us happy and he was on it.

Chicago style is my favorite and in NYC I get very very little of it,  so I jumped at the chance to try these guys out while in Vegas for a trade show.  I thought I was hungry enough to finish a small by myself,  but my server accurately predicted that I'd need a box in the end.   Sure enough, after 3 of the 6 slices of my deep dish classic Chicago pie I was done.  It was,  I believe, the best pizza I've ever had, and that's saying a lot.  I took the rest in a box to my hotel room with fantasies about my next days lunch.  But the next day,  I realized I had no way to heat it up!  I just couldn't stomach having the best pizza I'd ever had cold, so I called the restaurant and asked if they wouldn't mind heating it up for me.  Well,  Erica told me that it would be a health code violation for them to serve me something that had been left out all night and day, but she related my tale to her manager and they offered to bake me a new pie for lunch if I brought in my receipt from the night before. What??  I got a little teary eyed as I blubbered and thanked her - I was totally overwhelmed!  They made me feel at home as I had my lunch at the bar (with another glass of that amazing Goose Island Greenline!) this time I could only put down 2 slices,  but I left with a heart a full as my stomach, more leftovers, and for the first time a desire to live in Chicago.  I can't say enough about the food and people at Giordano's!",

Got seated along the windows facing the Strip and it was great. One has a good view when the Bellagio Fountains are going on. They also have a small carry-out shop downstairs as well as a bar with table eat outside. Our server was Hector and he was great during our service so we made sure to mention it to the manager on duty, Nicolas.  Only comment is that they may want to up the amount of sausage in their pizzas as ours wasn't as loaded as it had been in Chicago but everything was delicious nonetheless!

Cesar was our waiter and he was amazing. He was great about putting in our orders letting us know about the yelp discount, and making sure our glasses were never empty.   We got a small and medium deep dish (wanted plenty of leftovers) and it was just as good as I remembered! Definitely coming back here again!   Note: it's located in the Ballys bazaar, and though they have a food window downstairs the restaurant is located upstairs.",

It's outside and a nice spot to people watch.  As far as the deep dish pizza, it was really good but I prefer Gino's.  Love the cornmeal crust there and the tangy/acidic sauce.  Giordano's is a more plain crust and milder sauce.  Very well done but not my preference.  Would go again though if I want pizza on the Vegas strip.",

I'm not a big fan of Chicago style pizza so I decided to go with their Chicken Parmesan (which I cut into before I took the picture). It was truly a good dish the chicken was nice and crunchy and the pasta was cooked perfectly! I really enjoyed the tomato sauce which wasn't too bitter as a matter of fact it was just right! This meal was the perfect end to an epic vacation! The only issue was with a server we had who started out amazing but ended up being full of attitude which caused her to get a sucky tip so her bad! I definitely recommend this place because the food is amazing and the prices are reasonable for Las Vegas! I would just like to say that not all of the servers were sucky so don't count them out because of our bad experience!",

My boyfriend and I came here super hungry and buzzed...lol we ordered buffalo wings, cheesy garlic bread and a small meaty meat deep dish pizza. Our waiter was super cool and quick. Our appetizers came out first and we devoured them in minutes. And then the wait begins....we came right before the rush and maybe had about 3 tables before us. Our pizza took forreeeeeeveerrr to come out. The appetizers pretty much settled into our stomach and we were feelin the alcohol - pretty much just done and ready to go. When the pizza came, it was more than enough for the two of us! We probably could've done without the appetizers for the size of a small. We each could barely finish a slice and packed the rest. We had the remaining the next day in the car on our way to Arizona and let me just tell you....it was SOOOOOO good!!!!! Omggggg. It was so, so good.   Alright...so to cap... -great service. The table was always cleared as items were finished and waters were always topped before they even got halfway.  -bomb diggity cheesy pizza and even better leftover and still bomb diggity cold.  -appetizers were mediocre.

    "text": "So this is one of my favorite pizza chains in the country and that says a lot since I live in Brooklyn and I'm surrounded by the best pizza around. BUT the stuffed pizza at Giordano's is like nothing you have ever had before. Unfortunately this visit was awful. First off the air conditioning wasn't working so as you can imagine in Vegas it was HOT up in there. Next, I tell the bartender that I know the stuffed pizza takes about 40-45 minutes so I wanted to order right away. He puts in my order and about 20 minutes later I am presented with a thin crust pizza by someone on the kitchen staff?!? I ask what this was because it wasn't my order. He speaks to the bartender and the bartender tells me he screwed up and they would need to remake my order. I ask if that means I had to wait 45 minutes from now and he says it should be ready in 35-40minutes. This is while I'm sitting in a place with no AC and my arms are sticking to the bar because it's so hot. People are walking out during this because it was too uncomfortable. Now my wait is even longer because of their mistake. 40-45 minutes later I get my pie. When I finish I ask for my bill and there is no discount of any kind after all of this. Additionally, I was never visited by any manager to apologize for what had happened. They walked passed me numerous times but no one asked how I was doing or if everything was ok. Isn't that the floor managers responsibility?!? Extremely disappointed and expect more when I am paying $22.for a small pizza!  So I came back after 1/2 a year. I waited God know how long for a medium pizza and it was forever. My bartender kept telling me more time even after I saw 35-40 min and he kept saying 20 more minutes?!? What happened to 45 minutes. Then he wanted to argue with me rather than apologize. Obviously he put my pizza order in after my appetizer so I had to wait 45 minutes after the 20 I had already waited but refused to acknowledge that. I'm never coming back. F this place! They will offer you the world and offer nothing cause this place sucks!!!",

When you walk in, you can see the pizza makers right behind the hostess making the dough.  You can't help but wonder at the deep pans these giant cheese and tomato pies go into.  We got a great seat overlooking the Grand Bazaar with the Bellagio serving as a backdrop from floor to ceiling windows.  Our server, Kelly, greeted us in a slow, Texan drawl that oddly reminded me of American Idol and warmth of greeting unique to Southern belles.  She had quite a few tables she was serving.  Helping out with the setup as well as the cleanup.  Hats off to someone who made it look easy.  I have so much respect for good servers in a town known for service.  It lent well to a great dining experience.    Good food, good ambiance, and great service - I highly recommend!",

I was also nervous at the same time. Occasionally some franchises are not the same when they tend to expand to different areas, however this was not the case. We ordered a small deep dish. Between my husband and I, we could not finish it. I hate that I couldn't because it sure was delicious! Totally worth the 45 minute wait.  Just beware of you go hungry you will need to order an appetizer. Other than that. Get a drink, relax, and catch a game on their tv screen.",

We ordered a personal size deep dish and were informed it would take about 40 mins as they are cooked when ordered. That's fine. We waited and when it finally came out not only was the crust tough, but it wasn't even hot!  The meatballs were seriously lacking any spices. And the marinara sauce was just ok. We also ordered a cup of coffee which tasted awful. As for the service it was very slow especially considering they weren't even full. A couple behind us ended up in an argument with their waiter due to the bad service and they were kicked out by security. With so many good options on the strip, I'll definitely be going elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "Having never tried Chicago style deep dish pizza, this place was a must! I ordered the medium Chicago classic deep dish pizza, a small extra thin crust chicken pesto pizza, and \"the best\" tomato bruschetta as a starter.  The medium deep dish pizza was the absolute highlight of the meal. Very generous toppings and portions that was perfect for a party of 4. Was piping hot and ingredients meshed perfectly together in every bite. Loved the texture in the crust resembling a pie. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  On the contrary, the small extra thin crust pizza was easily forgettable. It was super dry and lacked flavor. Ingredients were very sparsed and was quite a let down. Will never order again. Disappointed.   Joined their free loyalty program(G Club) and they offered a free starter with purchase. Picked the bruschetta and it was quite tasty. Only negative was portions were tiny. If it weren't for the offer, I wouldn't order it again.   Overall, I was pleased with my order. Service was A1. It did take around a 45 minute wait for everything to arrive to the table. Ordering online and picking up at the window is also an option. (They don't do delivery at this location). Ciao!",

The pizza crust had the consistency of saltine crackers, basically everything you do not want in a pizza crust.  As a whole the quality of food was very sub par.  Someone we were with also ordered a Italian sandwich with Parmesan fries. The fries were clumped together with so much garlic and Parmesan they were not edible.   I did give two stars (if I was grading the food it would be zero starts) based on service. Our waiter was attentive and handled the bad experience we had very well, as did the manager who took 20% off the bill.    As a whole we ordered 3 pizzas, calamari & 3 sandwiches. They only thing that was finished and was solid was the buffalo chicken sandwich.  I would recommend not eating here solely on the product of food.   With tons of cheaper grab and go options I would encourage you to not rely on this place for a solid meal.",

I had 3 slices and was done.  Host took an order for deep dish when we arrived but it still took bit of time for it to come out.    Where we were sitting on 2nd floor, we were able to see the Bellagio fountain show but show wasn't the same without the music.  And everyone was hungry to even notice.    Definitely will come back when we return to Las Vegas.  Next time, Italian beef sandwich along with deep dish.",

I was in Vegas for work this week and I LOVE Giordano's, but dairy does not love me, so I wanted to eat my pizza somewhere where I could run to the bathroom after if needed. They have a takeout stand in the Grand Bazaar shops, which was perfect because then I brought my pizza back to my hotel.  $10-11.90 will get you an individual pizza of your choice - I opted for pepperoni. I asked if they could do a mushroom pizza instead and they said yes, but it was 30-45 minutes and I didn't want to wait. They have cheese, spinach, pepperoni, and sausage options, all ready to go. They also have bottled water for $1.65 which is probably the cheapest you will find on the Strip.  My pizza was still mostly warm-ish when I got back to the hotel which was also nice. The pepperoni was a bit spicy but overall it was very tasty.  Hoping to do dine-in here at some point - they have both an outdoor area and indoor - but since I was by myself this time, I just wanted takeout.",

    "text": "We walked by this place several times on the strip.  Each time the pizza looked good and smelled delicious  as people were eating on the outside patio.   What we ordered: The meat pizza deep dish style for 2-3 people, 6 slices.  The serving size was just right.  We were able to eat only no more than 2 slices each with 2 slices left over.    Price: Less than $33.  Taste: I love a good doughy pizza and this was it!  It was cooked just right where it didn't taste raw.  The amount of cheese on the pizza was great too. If you're a cheese lover you'll love eating this when its fresh out the oven.  There was a lot of meat toppings.  I was skeptical paying so much for a 6 slice pizza but we will be back when in Vegas again.   *** TIP: Please be aware it takes 45min-1hr for your pizza to be ready.  My suggestion is to call in your order or place your order while there as a to go order.  By the time you arrive it will be hot and ready and you can eat it there or else where.  But remember it's hot sitting outside. Or you can walk around for a bit and come back.    Environment: This location is outside with a roof covering but no windows or fans.  Just outside air.  Great place to eat at once the sun has set.  When we were there it was 97 at 11pm and it was hot.  It was clean. Lots of seating. Great for groups of 2-6 people.   Service:  The staff was friendly.  We found out they have a second location that's an actual restaurant and it's indoor.  The staff has to rotate being in the outdoor location.  Please be friendly to them, it's so hot outside and they still have a good attitude.   Our server was awesome.   We recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza!",

I ordered a small deep dish pizza and shared it with one more person. This was more than enough pizza and we still had extra to take home. The pizza had so much cheese and it tasted so delicious! Definitely one of my new favorite spots for pizza",

    "text": "I brought my group of 10 along with me on a Yelp adventure for lunch. Luckily the group agreed to tag along. We were seated quickly for an afternoon hour lunch. There are several options to dine here. You can place an order to go at the window downstairs, or there is an open-air patio in the bazaar with lots of misters to keep you cool. When it's 105 out, I recommend sitting inside. The view of the strip is nice. You will not be directly on the strip. It is on the upper level of the Bally's entrance.   If you are familiar with Chicago style deep dish, then you will be accustomed to the 45 minutes to 1 hour wait time for your pizza. We were hungry, so I had to order some wings to hold me over. Ordered them plain with sauce on the side. Not bad. Several of my friends ordered sandwiches.   I placed an order for the large Specialty pizza that can feed about 4-6 people. I would say more like 4-6 very hungry people. There were about 10 slices and they were thick and full of goodness. The difference between the Chicago Classic Pie and The Specialty is Sausage. If you order the Classis it will be full of pepperoni. Since I was paying for the pizza, I made sure to grab the biggest slice of the pie. I was very impressed with the texture and the slice's ability to stick together when I used the pie server for my slice. I have seen Chicago style pies fall apart as soon as they are picked up. I like to wait about 5-10 minutes after they bring it out, in order to give the cheese a little time to thicken up.   I felt like I was in the sharing mood, so I offered up some slices and there were only a few in my group that took me up on the offer. I think they were full of their sandwiches or they are more like fools for skipping out on some this Chicago style goodness. I had one slice left and decided to take it with me. There was a gentleman walking on the street (I presume he was a transient) who asked me for a slice of pizza, and I thought to myself, what would a Yelper do? That's right, we do the right thing and share the goodness of food, so I gave him the slice.   Of course, this place is pricey for some. Don't come here expecting $1.99 pizza slices on the strip. The large specialty was about $38. Pitcher of beer, go ahead and add on another $20. Overall, it's a cool place and the service is great. The bartender shortchanged me on my pitcher and before I could open my mouth, she told me the keg ran out and she will bring me a pint of beer to make up for it. That's some great service. Our server was nice and did a good job managing my group.",

    "text": "My favorite deep dish Chicago pizza I've had in my life. Granted this location is not as good as the original Chicago location its the closest thing to it that I've had anywhere else. The famous cheese pull is my favorite part leading up to the amazing devour that follows. Everything about Giordanos pizza is great, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings.   I highly suggest when coming here if you've never been before, order a drink and or appetizer right when you sit down because the pizza takes about 45 minutes to be ready and on your table from the time you order. Also the portions can be deceiving if your use to a regular pizza place. A small is plenty for 2 people and a medium is plenty for 3 people. It's extremely thick and packed to the max so you'll be pretty fully off of two slice and very full off of 3. You've been warned lol.  Enjoy",

I like that they offer family style plates which is definitely enough to feed a crowd.   Why the 3 stars?? Well, the service, I wanted to find excuses for the girl, but it just wasn't justified.   Our drinks took a while to come to the table, she took our food order and got then got our item wrong. My brother in law ordered the lasagna and it never came out, he also ordered a salad and brought out the wrong one. They never even asked which salad he ordered so they can correct it.   When it was time to pay our check, it was all incorrect, she attempted to fix it, but when it came out the 2nd time, it was still incorrect. At this point we were over it and and just wanted to pay and leave.  Being that my family was in from out of town and they love this place, I'm disappointed on the lack of customer service. I feel like if we are going to pay that much for food (it is a bit pricey, but it's on the strip and the food is great, you get what you pay for) they should have left happy.",

We ordered a small deep dish with beef and green peppers and ordered a lasagna....  The pizza was DELICIOUS. I am absolutely SHOCKED at how good it was. It was unique and i couldn't stop eating it.  However my one star is deducted because of how bad the lasagna was. Probably one of the worst I've ever had. It had NO taste and was very bland! Honestly forced it down my throat so i didn't waste it and i threw away the left overs. I don't know how it's possible to taste so bland!  I'm pretty bummed that i didn't order a bigger pizza and skip out on the lasagna. DO NOT ORDER THE LASAGNA PLEASE. I'd come back just for the pizza! Amen.",

If you are in the mood for some Chicago style pizza and Italian food on the strip, this is the place to go. We didn't opt for the deep dish because it takes 35-40 min to come out of the oven and we were in a rush. We ordered a large \"The Special\" thin crust pizza and  family style salad, spaghetti with meat sauce, and lasagna. This was more than enough to feed seven people. The food tasted great - super gooey cheesy goodness. Pricing was reasonable by strip standards, and the main dining room even has a view of the fountain show over at the Bellagio. Overall, a nice option if you are center strip and looking for some reasonable priced and good food.",

Ordered online assuming the restaurant was busy and as I'm staying at Bally's where the restaurant is in the Promenade outside. Props to the pizza being ready on time.  But if it's ready on time and Giordano's doesn't have the staffing or logistics so that customers can pick up the pizza promptly upon arrival, that is a big problem. Especially if the pizza and other item, which is supposed to be cold, sit on the counter. Unfortunately the pickup window doubles as the to-go window so anyone who wants to order a personal pizza or beer or whatever is in the same line as you.   One small pickup window, and therefore I had to wait 15 minutes just to get to the window to pick up my pizza. Of course even though so many orders were going out of that holding area to the Giordano's bar on that level, my pizza and bruschetta sat on the counter. My pizza was not in the warming holding oven as it is supposed to be for pptimum temperature. Especially if staff cannot deal efficiently with people in line.  Most of that would be annoying only if the food were incredible the way it normally is in Chicago. It wasn't. The layers are supposed to almost melt together rather than be segregated which is what I received. It was almost like a pizza version of lasagna or stromboli. Lukewarm fully cooked though, but just meh. And bruschetta, which costs $11 as an appetizer, happened to be deconstructed showing only four pieces of small bread as part of the order. I've had this item before and it is much larger...is this a Vegas portion?  Finally...the service. The staff member at the pickup window, when she finally got to me (I did feel sorry as it was her against the world but that should not be my concern as a customer picking up and almost $40 pizza and bruschetta order), decided to start to beg for a tip. As I place the order online and chose to prepay with credit card (it says to pay at pickup if adding a tip and I could have if doing so in cash), \"would you like to add a tip for me?\" was very inappropriate. Especially when that person is literally handing you two boxes that contain your pizza and bruschetta. And a good thing that I did not tip - even though I was asked how many people were in my party for the purposes of plates, napkins, etc, this person shorted or omitted items. For three people, we had two plates, two napkins and two settings - and no Parmesan cheese or hot pepper packets as requested in my online order. So this was either this person's incompetence or retribution for assuming no tip.    (Fyi...the reason folks do not add a tip to an advance credit card order is to, based on the customer experience, tip in cash as appropriate.)  I guess the moral to the story is, if you are never ever going to be in Chicago, take your chances and hope for the best with Giordano's anywhere else. Otherwise really avoid Giordano's in Vegas or any other City because it just can't even come close to replicating the food quality and experience of the real thing. And it's certainly not a cheap dining experience.  One tip, if you are in Vegas and get downtown, go to Four Queens Casino's Chicago Pub for its excellent deep-dish pizza that is half the price.  PS sad for me as I live in Denver and a Gios location just opened - with many of the same service and logistical issues plus no online ordering.",

    "text": "I was only here for the pizza and beer, so this review will only reflect that.  So, I'll start by going over the best part of the review, the pizza.  Bottom, this was some of the best pizza I have ever had.  It was delicious, flavorful, and different than any other pizza I have had before, so if you're looking for awesome pizza you can't really get anywhere else, go here because this pizza is worth it.  Now, on to why I only gave 4 stars and not 5.  As amazing as the pizza was, my biggest gripe is that it was served cold.  Not super cold, but fresh pizza is supposed to be hot when it comes out and it wasn't up to par.  Now, the reason for this is because the pizzas are made upstairs and a different building and has to be transported, in open air (though the outside, not inside of a joint building) before it gets to you, which takes about 45 minutes to make the pizza.  I can live with it taking 45 minutes to make, but the travel it goes through is terrible.  This and the fact that the beers were like twice the price of any other beer on the strip were straight turn offs for me.  I absolutely loved the pizza and I'm a pizza lover and I would like to visit this place again, but if I feel like the separate-building situation will be an issue next because they're busy or the weather or any of a million different reasons, I might have to pass .  Again, amazing pizza, but you need a new venue.",

It's definitely touristy so you'll pay tourist prices but it's Vegas,  that's how it goes on the strip.  There's an outdoor patio as well as an indoor eating area with good views of nearby buildings.

    "text": "CARBS! CHEESE! DEEP DISH! Yup, that's what you get at Giordano's, now in Vegas at Bally's Grand Bazaar Shops.  Those cheese pulls are the real deal because if you order a deep dish pizza, it's filled with cheesy goodness.  I can only handle about 1.5 slices exactly because it's a lot of stuff, but delicious stuff.   We arrived today around noon and it was perfect timing because the lunch rush started right after that.  Just know that an order of deep dish takes about 35-45 minutes to prepare, a warning that's printed right on the menu.  We ordered the Harvest Green salad to eat while we waited. The salad has spring greens, candied walnuts, dried fruit and blue cheese tossed in balsamic, a nice and light combination of ingredients.  The medium size is enough for two people. Our waiter, Jose, was good about keeping us informed about the status of our pizza, letting us know when it was five minutes from arriving.  When it did, we were ready to chow down.  Jose did the honors of serving us our slices, cheese pulling included.  I am a big fan of the cheesiness of this pizza and the crust seals the deal.  Like I stated before, a little goes a long way; this stuff is so thick that one slice is probably equivalent to two regular thin crust slices.   If you go with the intention of ordering deep dish, just be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. Service was wonderful throughout the meal and if you can sit by the window, you have a nice view.",

    "text": "GIORDANOS in VEGAS? It's a combination of my two favorite things! We have been to the original in Chicago, and we're happy to find this gem right outside our hotel, Ballys.  Pro tip- the deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes to master. Come starving, or not, because if you are- you will be completely full soon, and if you aren't, you shouldn't mind waiting. The wait is what it is- and it won't change. Perfection takes time, so don't complain.  Giordanos deep dish is an experience. The sauce is on top of the ocean of cheese below. This time we went with an individual to split and each got a side salad. One star loss for my Greek salad because it had some old looking lettuce. Not a huge deal, but would have been an easy fix.  This amount of food was perfect because we were hungry but not starving. We actually went with some tiramisu at the end. It was still partially frozen- and our server said he had never sold dessert to anyone before. Haha.   All in all it was pretty great. If you have the chance, go to the one in Chicago, but this is a great option as well. :)",

    "text": "I had two encounters with Giordano's on Easter weekend, one not so pleasant and the second absolutely incredible.  1st Attempt:  I searched online and the website said that the restaurant was open till 2am so I thought, \"Perfect late night snack!\" As we walk straight into the upstairs restaurant at the Bally's, we noticed no one would seat us. We basically stood around looking to see if anyone would seat us or if we were going to seat ourselves. Finally, after looking awfully dumb in the middle of the room, a waiter came up to us and told us the indoor seating was closed at 12am (mind you it was 12:05am and they did not close the doors). He explained to us that we were able to eat in their outdoor area downstairs (he did not mention any exceptions to the menu at this point). I was dying to try their pizza so of course I wanted downstairs to their outside location.  We checked in at the front podium where we were quickly seated and a waiter came over to take our order. Upon reading the menu, it read individual deep dish options and it gave a brief listing of them. I was a little concerned but I thought the waiter would definitely ease my worries with a simple explanation of the incomplete menu that was handed to me.  We raised our concerns with the waiter and he explained that at 12am they stop making their deep dish pizzas and only offer the individual size options because it takes much less time to cook. The regular deep dish pizzas take a minimum of 45 minutes to cook. I was highly disappointed that the waiter couldn't make an exception to make the deep dish seeing as it was early enough in the night to do so. Sadly, I left disappointed with my craving unsatisfied.   2nd Attempt:  I couldn't leave Vegas without trying Giordano's, even if the first time was a complete and utter disappointment. During the day, the staff are incredibly nice and they help you deciding what to eat and even what deep dish size is recommended for your party size. We went with the Meat & More Meat in a small and trust me when I say, this will be a lot. Honestly, this is enough for 4 people to eat comfortably with appetizers included. We tried the Crispy Chicken Tenders and the chopped salad which are both very delicious.  The anticipation of the deep dish's arrival is insane because you're building up this crazy appetite but as it's placed down in front of you, it's a spectacle to see! The waiters help serve you but I think it's so much more fun to cut into that pie yourself. The cheese is so stringy and if you're not careful it gets everywhere but I feel that's where the fun lies. The meats are perfectly cooked (I did not get a undercooked bite and I hear that's always an issue with deep dishes). Ohhhhh and the crust is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! It's thin but crispy and just everything you hope for in every bite accompanying the melted cheese and delicious meat filled pie.   Staff was attentive, the deep dish pizza and crust were amazing, and lastly the restaurant location is perfect if you're a people watcher :)",

Absolutely nothing to complain about. Yummy. Let's talk about the stuffed deep dish: Thin crust, not too thin. Flaky not soggy. We got the meat lover and added some veggies. That was a mistake on my part. I listened to the old lady and I knew better. I blame myself for that one.  Should have only had the meat lovers. Anyways, layers. They later each incident randomly which is awesome. They stuff this bad boy with so much cheese, it's insane. When the waitress (who was awesome) raised the first piece it almost hit the roof. I'll post a pic of that.  I can't stop talking about this damn pizza. I've shown everyone at work the pics and even one twice. Well, enjoy if you go. I will.",

The servers show no sense of urgency, and when you are only 1 of 3 tables at open, getting refills for the 45 minute wait shouldn't be so difficult.  Luckily, we will be hitting this place every time we go to LV...for the pie, not the service   Original 3/30/17 review:  As good as the Chicago original.  We went to a Giordano's in 2015 while in Chicago for some Royals games.  Just fell in love with this deep dish pizza...very worth the wait.  Visiting Henderson/Vegas this March and found out that this had opened on the Strip.  Because we visit Vegas fairly often, we don't really go to the Strip anymore.  But, by god, we were gonna trek our happy asses anywhere to get this pie.  We got there at opening, so our pizza that probably would have taken 45 min took exactly 1 hour because it was the first pizza in the oven that day and because we ordered a large so we could take some back \"home\" to our friends that we were staying with (they've never had Giordano's).  I'm telling you, this is a heavy pie...TONS of cheese, great \"toppings\" and a nice crispy crust that is just thick enough to hold this work of art together.  So don't go ordering one and then bitching that you have cheese gut :) It's worth it!!  I'm supposed to be dairy and grain free and I did not care one bit what the repercussions would be.   It was good as what we had in Chicago.  Will go here every trip back to Vegas...guaranteed. Won't be upset if there's a location off the Strip that is more convenient though :)    Enjoy guys!!",

    "text": "So to preface this experience, I have to say that this is my first time trying real Chicago deep dish pizza. Giordano's is the newest addition to the Grand Bazaar Shops that are located in front of Bally's.   They opened very recently 12/13 apparently but when I stopped by everything was in full swing and boy was it packed. You have the option of the indoor section of the restaurant on the second floor or their open bar area downstairs. We opted for the second floor because the weather was a little brisk in December to be sitting outside.   For our food we opted for the appetizer sampler and sharing two deep dish pizzas. The appetizer sampler includes their cheesy bread, mozzarella triangles, chicken wings, and potato fritters. The cheesy bread was quite delicious and I would order it standalone next time!  For our pizzas, we opted for the Chicago Classic (pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms and onions) and the Meat and More Meat (pepperoni, sausage, salami and bacon). Our waitress warned us that the pizzas can take up 45 minutes to prep and bake. I'm glad that they warned us ahead of time instead of us just waiting around wondering if they were forgotten.   The pizzas were.. interesting. I'm still not convinced about Chicago deep dish pizzas but this was my first time trying this style. The pizza was pretty tasty but very very saucy and cheesy, something I'm not entirely used to. But you be the judge!  You can park in the lot shared by Bally's and Paris (hopefully they don't start charging for it anytime soon) and just walk out towards the strip from Bally's. The entrance is on the second floor.",

Im not a fan of deep dish chicago but dang Eating here changed my perception. I never been to an authentic Chicago style Pizza until eating here. I was in a terrible mood and hungover from the LV shenanigans when all of a sudden I was approached by a friendly staff of Host, Food runners, and servers. Our server in particular was awesome and Professional. She asked if I wanted my salad before or with my meal and constantly checked our table for drink refills. I never had to ask her for a thing. She was super attentive and cheerful. I left there in a great mood because of her service. Her name is Sandy and I want to say her work ethic was Epic to say the least. Thanks for a great dining experience and I will return next time I visit Vegas. The person that brought the pizza offered to slice and serve the first piece of pizza and that was a delightful surprise. They even had heaters in their dining area and clean dishes. All restaurants should have this type of dining experience but they don't. I am telling my friends and Fam about this place its a must to eat here when you're in Town!",

One slice I had lifted the cheese and there was a single sausage and one thin slice of salami.  The cheese wasn't even melted all the way through. It is as if they put blocks of cheese all over and it mostly melted.  If they cut the cheese in half and added about 7 times the meat, then they would have a winner. Also, meat and more meat made me expect more than 4 types of meat....",

Giordano's is located right in front of Bally's Hotel & Casino on the Vegas Strip. They have a take out window and a dining area that is covered and away from the elements. (I didn't know that when the BF and I dined here on a COLD WINTER DAY). We ended up eating in the area outside with the pouring rain and the wind blowing!!  Let me be blunt, Giordano's claims to have a cheesy pizza which allows the patron to enjoy the \"cheese pull\" before one devours this pie! I saw a good video at this location on Yelp and had a mini foodgasm!! That cheese pull made me have dreams about having my own cheese pull experience!! They even have a sign that says people should post their best cheese pull videos  (the amount of cheese that goes into the pizza to make the cheese \"stretch for miles\")!!  SADLY, MY CHEESE PULL SUCKED!!  One of the best things I love about Lou Malnati's is that they deliver their pie in their signature steel pan! Their crust is cooked through and NOT reminiscent of CARDBOARD!  The BF kept telling our waiter the food was \"awesome\". I said it was decent. Yes, I am such a fan of Chicago Deep Dish (CDD) Pizza that I will not eat any other type of pizza! Of course, since we live in America, the BF is entitled to state his opinion, but I didn't have that same love. LOL.  We ordered the following:  -Chicago Classic Pie -Calamari -Minestrone (complimentary)  Chicago Classic Pie - Medium Pie (8 slices) - $30.25. (3.5 stars).  The toppings on the Chicago Classic were classic. No doubt. (Cheese, Pepperoni, Green Bell Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms). Honestly, I hate green  peppers (I picked them out - they are too bitter for my liking) and raw or undercooked onions. YUCK.  That crust though... really ruined my experience. After chiseling through the crust for what seemed like hours, I was able to take a forkful to my drooling mouth... Ingredients were tasty, but again, the crust (sans the pan), was disappointing.  Yes, my expectations are high. Many Yelpers have said that. But I know what I love and I also know what I won't accept. Next time I'll order the CDD but just scoop the toppings out! ;)  Calamari - $11.95. (4 stars).  Soft and moist, fried and tasty. Fried up nicely! This appetizer was surprisingly very tasty!! Just a little seasoned salt and fresh squeeze lemon and I was good to go. It comes with a marinara dipping sauce but I prefer my calamari au natural. The rings and legs were tender and the batter was light and refreshing! I would definitely order this again!! The part that threw me off is that there are also fried banana peppers, green beans, and lemon wedges. I tried each one but only enjoyed the calamari itself.  Minestrone - FREE FOR KITCHEN OVERSIGHT. (4 stars).  Such a nice hearty soup which went well on a cold winter's day! Very heart warming! I would order this again!  I normally don't comment about service but our waiter Josh was exceptional and the manager gave the BF and I a complimentary bowl of Minestrone soup, since the BF's cup came out with coffee stains (he ordered TEA), which was warming and perfect for the cold weather!  ---  All in all, Giordano's is right across the street from the Bellagio... if I really have a hankering for CDD pie I will still come here since I find myself in Vegas much more than Chi-town. (But I will make my trek back to Lou Malnati's one day to have my all time favorite!)  Giordano's does have a take out window, but for those who aren't familiar with CDD pies, they take a LONG WHILE TO MAKE!! Average wait times are about 45-55 minutes.   LOU MALNATI's is so worth the wait though!",

We walked in and didn't feel like it was that hot at all....and I was really craving the pizza anyways!   So, we got a table next to the window with a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. We ordered the small deep dish with pepperoni and mushroom.  We were aware that the deep dish takes about 45 minutes, so we decided to order garlic parmesan fries to hold us over.  The fries came out fairly quickly and they were fresh and tasty.  Being by the window really helped in passing the time, as we got a chance to watch the fountains.    The pizza came out at about the 45 minute mark and the server served it to us with that infamous \"cheese pull\".  It was everything that I expected in a great deep dish.  The crust wasn't to thick, sauce ratio was good, lots and lotsa of cheese and yummy pepperoni and mushrooms!  The slices are pretty big and being deep dish....very filling.  I only could finish about a 1/3 of my slice and my boyfriend only could finish one slice.  It was so good and I wanted to eat more, but I couldn't do it!  I think I was a little full off of the fries.  So, we took the rest of the pizza home for later.  When we warmed it up in the microwave it still tasted yummy!  We will definitely be back and might not order anything else but the pizza, so we can enjoy more of it!",

As the lack of phone/online ordering was the only reason I deducted 1*, it's only fair to bump them up to 5*. I also appreciate that they reached out to me, which shows they care about the customers.  To recap my prior review - Vegas is super lucky to get what is my favorite all-around Chicago deep dish spot; this Giordano's is the real deal, existing fans shouldn't hesitate to eat here, and those who have never tried it should definitely stop by.",

Hubby is from Chicago and I just love pizza so we have been awaiting this opening for quite some time.  We came in after work on opening day and were surprised when there was no wait for a table.  We sat in the upstairs area and had a great window seat.  Our server was friendly and helpful, although he did keep reminding us how long the pizza takes to cook and we felt pressured to put our deep dish order in right away, even after we told him we had been to Giordano's before and were familiar with the process.  We ordered a Giordano's Sampler, large Pepperoni stuffed deep dish and a medium Meat and More Meat thin crust.  Everything was delicious.  I was a little worried it wouldn't be as good as in Chicago but it tasted the same.  We met the district manager at the Mag Mile location on our last visit and when we asked when Vegas would be open he said they wouldn't open until they got it right.  Well they definitely got it right.  I can't wait to go back.    They also have very inexpensive kids meals that includes a drink.  Love that.",

The waiter and waitresses were very kind and informed us about their menu and their own opinions on which food on their menu tastes the best.  I ordered a house salad which was put together proportionately well. They gave the right amount of dressing and cheese. The bread was extremely warm and soft!  The deep dish pizza I ordered was extremely cheesy! 2 Slices was enough to fill me up and every bite was very flavorful. The small deep dish pizza was definitely enough to fill up 3 people.  Overall, great customer service. They checked on me every so often to see how we are doing and if we needed anything as well as boxed the food for us to go. I would definitely come here if you do not mind the 45 minute wait for a deep dish pizza because that's how long it takes to cook a fresh one. I recommend ordering the deep dish pizza first so they get it started before looking at the other food in the menu.",

    "text": "So darn good. Seriously. This location of Giordano's is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops at Bally's. I came here with a group of friends not too long after they first opened and we shared the Chicago Classic, Fresh Spinach Deep Dish and one of their thin crust pizzas along with the House Salad and everyone was pleased. Pleased enough that I have been back to eat by myself! Yep, I have had a cravings for this perfectly prepared deep dish pizza and came here all by my lonesome which meant I didn't have to share ha! Pizza is one of those things I personally feel that is best shared with family and friends, but Giordano's offers their famous deep dish pizzas in different sizes making it perfect for the times you want to make memories around a pie with people and perfect for the times you just want to have a pizza moment to yourself lol. Pizzas come in individual 6 inch, small, medium and large sizes. Staff is really nice and checked on the table often.   Harvest Greens Salad ($5.95 for small size) - Spring greens, candied walnuts, dried fruit and blue cheese. This salad comes with balsamic vinaigrette, but you can choose a different dressing like it did by asking for ranch and I did ask for tomatoes to be added which was no problem and they didn't even charge me extra which is nice since a lot of places do. The salad tasted great and was a nice portion for the price. Totally worth it.   Individual 6 Inch Deep Dish Pizza ($10.45) - Each additional topping is $0.95 cents per topping and proteins are $1.45 per topping. I had mine with pepperoni and it was sooooo good! The deep dish pizzas take a little longer to cook, 30-45 minutes depending on size. The bottom crust has the perfect crispness which is necessary to hold all of that glorious cheese the deep dish pizzas here offer. They certainly don't skimp on cheese and the sauce tastes great. Definitely a worthy deep dish pizza.   Besides deep dish, they also have hand-stretched thin crust and crispy extra thin crust pizzas and they have the option for a gluten free thin crust. You can place an order for pick-up on their website or phone it in.",

    "text": "I was going to meet some friends at Giordanos in the early evening on Friday,  Feb 9. When I got there at 6:00pm, I was shocked to see that the entire restaurant was filled! Apparently, a birthday party added to the crowd. It was recommended to me to order the pizza while waiting (30-40 minute wait to be seated, 45 minute wait while the deep dish pizza cooked). The other people in my party didn't arrive until about 6:20, so we ordered our pizza then and waited. We were seated shortly after 6:30.  Even though we ordered while waiting to be seated, the restaurant was so crowded that evening that they were apparently backed up on cooking the pizzas. It took a loooong time for the pizza to arrive, but when it did, it took the sting out of waiting so long. The large deep dish pepperoni pizza was excellent! Our server was friendly, fun and attentive in refilling our drinks.  The experience was great with the exception of the really long waits. However, I guess that is the price you must pay for getting excellent Chicago deep dish pizza on a busy night at the start of the weekend. The long waits are the only reason that I rated four instead of five stars.",

Restaurant is very laid-back and kid friendly staff is friendly and welcoming, waiter was very upfront and informed us of wait time for deep dish pizza. We started with Caesar salad and calamari both were enough to feed three people, and the medium deep dish was enough for three and leftovers.

    "text": "I was looking forward to Giordano's ever since they first opened (and when I saw people posting the famous cheese pull on IG). If I ever went to Chicago, my first meal would be DEEP DISH PIZZA.   The host offered me a buzzer, or to text me when my table was ready but I told her I would wait inside since its freezing outside. There's not much standing room inside and it was packed when other people started to come in.   At first glance, the restaurant looks pretty small but it does wrap around. There's a pretty good view of the strip if you sit towards the windows, but if you don't then they have comfy looking booths in the back that can seat about 6-8 people. There's a big EAT PIZZA sign on the back wall which is good for taking pictures ;) There's a wrap around bar with a bunch of TVs.   Service was good, our server checked on us quite often but she had a lot of trouble hearing what we ordered because the music was pretty loud. Bathrooms were clean, but they need to put seat protectors in the bathrooms!  3/5 Caesar salad was average. There are 3 sizes to each of their salads... I think the first one is personal, entree and then family (serves 4-6) and pricing varied. The Caesar salad wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad either (how can you mess up a caesar salad?). It also came with a piece of cheese bread. My friends said there wasn't enough dressing but I'm sure we could have asked for extra dressing on the side. The entree size was a good started for 3 people.   4/5 Garlic parmesan fries were SOOO good. We could actually taste the garlic AND the fries were crispy! One of the better garlic parmesan fries I've had, for sure. However, we got a lot of small pieces. It seemed like we got leftover pieces of fries or something like that.   2/5 Pepperoni pizza. Their pizzas come in 3 different sizes and you can add different protein or vegetables to them for an additional cost. They also have hand stretch thin crust pizza (I'm guessing thats the regular pizza crust you find elsewhere) and extra thin crust pizza. I guess I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza because I found the pizza to be on the salty side AND it had way too much cheese for me. My friends did enjoy it, and they did not think it was salty. I found myself getting tired of the pizza after the first slice and towards the end I just peeled off the cheese and ate the crust and pepperoni. Also, the longer you let the pizza sit, the less good it good (obviously). We ordered the MEDIUM for 3 people. On the menu, it said a medium was good for 3-4 people and its pretty accurate. Between the 3 of us, we only ate 4 slices so had half leftover.   Cocktails here are $11.50 but the pitchers of beer were about $16-17. We ordered a mojito and it had way too much mint and was a tad bit sweet. We also ordered a pitcher of blue moon. We were able to get about 6 glasses from the pitcher so its definitely worth it to order a pitcher if you're in a large group and everyone wants a drink.   4/5 We got tiramisu for dessert and it was pretty good. However, I thought it was pretty small for $7. While I found it to be moist and soft, it was lacking coffee! It wasn't too sweet either, which I liked.   Dinner for 3 with 2 drinks and a pitcher was around $80. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will be back next time to try their thin crust pizzas.",

Prior to eating this in Vegas I had only had Giordanos delivered frozen from Chicago and it was great like that, but there is no comparison to having it fresh! I was sooo hungry so when we ordered I wanted to order a medium but my husband assured me a small was enough for both of us. When the pizza arrived (it takes a while but they let you know that in advance and trust me it's worth it) I looked at it, looked at my husband and I was like \"dude I'm totally gonna eat this whole thing by myself.\" He laughed. No faith in me. But he was right, 1 and a half slices in and I was done. The pizza is thick with cheese that melts and stretches perfectly, deliciously robust tomato sauce, and the toppings of your choosing. The crust is so good, great flavor and nice and flaky. I can't wait until we get to eat this again!",

First time I was there doing the day time and the place was not busy so not sure why it took so long to greet me. Second time was at night and place was busy so I could understand that night.

The pizza was very cheesy and the marinara sauce was very flavorful and rich, their Mediterranean salad was also very fresh and delicious. Also, the waiter was very attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "I love Chicago style deep dish and have been wanting to come here since they opened. Las Vegas, for all the Illinois transplant's, doesn't really have great Chicago style Pizza. I finally made a trip to Bally's just to eat here.  First off all, this place gets packed. I went on a weekday and was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes to be seated for a party of two. By the time we left the waits were up to an hour or longer. Also, if you want to order a deep dish pizza it does take a while to bake (about 30 minutes, and they are good about warning you about it), so this isn't a place to go to if you are pressed for time.  The Pizza was overpriced, even considering the strip location. Our large pizza was over $30, which isn't worth it even considering how big the pizza is. When the Pizza showed up, they tried to stretch the cheese like you see in the pictures on Yelp, but it snapped immediately so no presentation points here. The server even kind of apologized and said it doesn't always stretch that way every time. Not that something like that matters to me, I only bring it up because I think we got shorted on toppings compared to the average pizza here. After we were done dining and left, I looked at a lot of the other pictures I saw on Yelp and I just think our's wasn't loaded up with cheese like they usually do.  The crust has a buttery taste, but it's very soft which I don't really like. Heck, I thought it might be slightly undercooked but when I reheated some leftover slices in the oven the next day they didn't taste any crispier, so I guess that's just how it's supposed to be. All in all, the Pizza was just OK, not bad, but nothing that would blow you away. And considering this Pizza cost over $30, my wife and I were both very disappointed.  The only thing we did like was the Italian beef sandwich. We ordered it to split as an appetizer since they Pizza was going to take so long to bake and it was delicious. If I ever came back here, which I doubt, I would get this over the Pizza. The meat was juicy and the peppers went perfectly with it.  With all the good reviews for the Pizza here, and I can only think that Giordano's either screwed up our pizza or the reviewer's haven't had good Chicago Pizza before, but I lean towards the former. There is no way the Giordano's in Illinois serves pizza of the quality we were given and got so successful. This isn't a place I would ever return to again based on this experience.",

    "text": "Ever since I saw that Giordano's opened in the Las Vegas area, I had been clamoring at the thought of trying it out.  It's located at the Bally's Hotel with two areas of seating.  They've got their restaurant on the second floor while hosting an outdoor seating area for those who want to enjoy their meal near the strip.  I was with a big group and ordered the meat lovers and sausage classic pies.  They take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour to make so allot yourself some time if you're going to eat here.  Deep dish pizza takes awhile to make since it's so thick.  Of the two, I prefer the classic sausage pizza.  It comes with a bunch of gooey cheese topped with the classic sausage taste.  I also tired their fried mozzarella and calamari, both which are excellent.  Will definitely stop by here again next time I'm in town.",

The good: the pizza, you get to sit in shade downstairs outside if it's hot, they have take out.  The bad: the wait time is ridiculous!! There are times where it's \"so busy\" that you don't see your food for a while. It's too close to others when it's crowded, take out has a specific time they shut the window because it takes 45 minutes to make a small pizza (Fine, I get it) but still.   I still find myself coming back if it's not too busy and I'm in the area. Otherwise, I'll never wait again!   On one bright side, customer service is good, and once we waited about an hour for food that when we complained to the manager, he took care of us and resolved the issue. So that left a good impression.",

We came the night before, but it was a bit crowded and the host recommended we come back around 3 to for happy hour, which brings us to now. Again, core reason I came was for the deep dish, Chicago style pizza, but we my wife and I took advantage of a few happy hour specials. The buffalo wings caught my eye and the bar tender offered to split them half and half, which we delightedly accepted. My wife ordered the mozzarella \"umbrella\" triangles. They came with a side of the most amazing marinara sauce which I believe was the same Giordanos uses on their pizzas. The wings came with a side of ranch which. The buffalo sauce was mild with a creaminess to it. The bbq was sweet. Chicken was fully sauced but crispy. Perfect. We waited a bit longer for our personal pizza which we split. It was everything I had hoped for. If yoga was a cheese, it's be mozzarella cause she can stretch for daaaaaaaaays. The crust was. Flaky and crispy which soaked up the moisture of the marinara. Since we sat at the bar for happy hour, my wife ordered a bud light to polish it all off. Great pizza experience Giadarnos! I will be back!",

Papa Johns has always been my go-to pizza store when I have been studying for my exams in college, so it was refreshing getting to try a new pizza place.  We ordered the small deep dish Super Veggie Pizza ($27.33 including taxes) and asked for sauce on the side.   The only sauce available was ranch. The ranch was not bad. It did not taste like refrigerated sauce and was not chunky.   The pizza was stuffed with tons of vegetables and had less cheese than I expected. I was hoping for it to be a little cheesier on the inside. It was interesting seeing the pizza stuffed with broccoli. Luckily, the brocolli pieces did not overpower the other toppings.   I really liked the crust! The whole crust was super crunchy.  This place is good in general and I may come back if I am in the area.",

    "text": "If you love Chicago style deep dish pizza, this is a must when visiting Las Vegas! Keep in mind that deep dish takes at least 45 minutes to bake, and on a busy night could take a lot longer. So order plenty of appetizers and drinks to tide you over!  Our only complaint is that the service is hit or miss. Sometimes you get an attentive server who is friendly, quick to refill drinks, totally great. Other times....crickets. I think the fact that the pizza takes a long time to cook, customers get impatient, servers start hiding because they don't have good news about when the pizza will be out, service spirals downwards.  On a recent visit we sat at the bar thinking we would get better service. No. One bartender serving the entire restaurant, barely time to take an order, much less offer a glass of water. We hung in there, made some new friends on either side of us due to our shared terrible experience. Poor guy next to us ordered a thin crust which took over 50 minutes, stuck behind deep dish orders. The guy on our other side was waiting on an individual pizza and that took even longer. It would have been easier if our bartender was offering us drink refills, another wine, but he was in the weeds.  This is where a restaurant manager can really help the situation. Checking on tables, giving assurances, refilling drinks themselves (not having someone else do it), clear some tables, even get behind the bar and pour a few beers. A good manager can make a huge difference in the customer experience, especially on a really busy chaotic night.   Of course we will come back again and again because the pizza is absolutely delicious.",

    "text": "This place is located right outside of Bally's and is famous for their Chicago-style deep dish pizza. We'd never tried deep dish pizza, so we figured we had better give it a try. If you're there during the week, there are drink and appetizer specials Mon-Thur from 3-7 if you don't mind sitting at the bar. We went ahead and sat at the bar to get the deals and the service was awesome. The deep dish pizza takes about 45 minutes, so we ordered the mozzarella sticks appetizer to have while we waited and they were delicious. Since it was just the 2 of us, we ordered a small deep dish and it was more than enough food. The pizza was absolutely awesome, everything we thought it would be. We were convinced we'd be able to eat it all in one sitting, but actually only ended up being able to each eat one slice. The pizza is just as good left over though. We'll definitely visit here again the next time we're in Vegas.",

I had noticed this place a few months ago, and during one of mine and my husbands what do you feel like eating games tonight games, I remembered and made my final answer. It's located at the shopping center outside Bally's on the strip, they have inside seating and you can go downstairs and they an outside bar and seating area. I also noticed downstairs has a ordering window for to go orders. They also advertise they ship all over the world.  It was a Friday night and there was a wait when we walked up to the upstairs inside location (we didn't know the downstairs section was separate until after we were done) we didn't want to wait so we walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and attentive. We ordered the meatball appetizers and the meat lover deep dish small pizza, they warned us the pizza was going to take 45 min. Our meatballs came out really fast, thank God! They were good, moist and flavorful the sauce is amazing.  When the pizza came out it was like a cheesy masterpiece. The bartender asked if we would like her to serve us our first pieces and to go with the flow of things I said yes (didn't record or photograph it thought) she served us a plate of cheesy, meaty, crispy goodness. I'm not sure if it's better to eat it with a fork and knife or with your hands, I started with a fork but ended with my hands. The crust was crispy even for being a deep dish it had a nice crunch to it the sauce was amazing, first bite and I knew I was in love. The small was a great size for the 2 of us, we ended up taking 3 pieces home.  It's a casual atmosphere and great for families. Reasonably priced for great food that you must try. Hands down my new favorite pizza.",

    "text": "Having had the original Giordanos deep dish pizza I wasn't expecting to eat it here. I'm frankly not a Giardanos nor any deep dish fan girl. I was happy to see a full menu and ordered an Italian beef which is a Chicago staple. It's a roast beef sandwich cooked in Italian herbs and spicy gardinera pickled veggies. Served with au jus. In Chicago you can get them  \"dipped\" which is the aujus already on the sandwich and requires a foil wrapper to keep it from falling apart. It came looking delicious(pics included). This was not the best Italian beef I've eaten but very edible! In Vegas you rarely can find food on the strip at a value. The price was $13.99 and that is a good value! My husband ordered the meatball sub. Giordanos meatballs are huge! Three makes a sub. That was also plentiful although under seasoned and extra marinara is required! We both got the Parmesan fries and they were good and plentiful as well. Why four stars you ask?well I've got to admit all the food was pretty spot on to the originals. Yep, I remember how the meatballs cooked in the marinara was a little underwhelming in Chicago as well. I never was extremely impressed with Giordanos but it is loved by many. I had great service at a good value and the food was as expected. So yeah it's four stars. The real deal and the price point was great for right on the strip.",

After 50 min we still hadn't got our food and many people that came after us were already eating or already finished their pizza! We were here to celebrate our daughter's first birthday (it's a tradition in our family) but after an hour waiting she and my other daughter fell asleep. Did I tell you that service sucked?!! So when I finally got the attention of the waiters (including trainee) they didn't say nothing, no sorry, we'll check, let me find out what's going on... nothing... so I told them can we please forget the kids meals, give us our food ASAP. They told us they were not able to do so but they got the manager.... manager Amanda came and she was really delightful, understanding, really on top of customer service. Then bill came and our waiter didn't say sorry nothing at all AGAIN!  The only reason to come back is for the food and the manager. But if I'll have the same waiter or trainee I'll ask for another person! They really ruined our night and special day  8/20/2019 Got comment/reply back on this review from Giordanos. I send twice an email. No reply back yet from them...",

We tried the wings with both BBQ & buffalo sauces and the calamari and both were excellent. For the main course, they had a pizza and I had the gluten-free penne pasta with meatballs and a meat sauce. Everything was great. The portions were large so if you take the family, you can easily share a dish and everyone will leave full. I also appreciated the attentive and welcoming staff.    The space is nicely decorated with great views. The tables are a good size and the seats are very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and attentive.

    "text": "Great place to grab an authentic slice of deep dish pizza in Vegas. There is open air seating at the street level as well as the main restaurant up one level. It's deep dish so keep in mind that it will take around 45 minutes to get your pizza, so you'll want to get your order ready quickly! We had the Italiano salad to start and the Deep Dish Medium Pepperoni and it was more than enough food for the two of us plus our toddler. Overall this is a great option in Vegas and very easy to get to right on the Strip.",

I thought Giordano's pizza was so good that I took a box home for my husband. So obviously we were thrilled to hear they were opening one in Las Vegas and sure enough it was just like I remembered it. Their pizza crust is the best and compares to no other!",

    "text": "Everyone in Chicago recommends them as one of the top deep-dish pizza places, that's when you get hooked. But if you live on the west coast you're out of luck! Well, kind of, now there is this one closest to home! When I came over a was looking for the big venue with a lot of tables and pizzas all over the place! Well, not here, this is a long bar outdoors, that's it! Which comes in handy when they tell say that you have to wait 45 min for your coveted deep dish pizza! And after a drink you have to eat something, so we got the mozzarella sticks, mmm, soo good! By the time we got the pizza (they bring them from their kitchen somewhere in Bally's) we were full and tipsy! The pizza is good, it's what you expect and more. The bar serves pretty much anything but it's not like they have a mixologist on location, they just pour the Sangria out of a box for you. Overall it's a \"must  try\" place, especially if you are from the left coast, especially if you like Chicago style pizza, and especially if you are hungry in Vegas!",

Anyway, if you do get a deep dish, just know that it does take a long time which they tell you about up front so you know. It took our pizza 45 minutes from when we ordered it, which is exactly the amount of time our waiter said it would take. We also got the sampler appetizers which were super good. It included boneless chicken wings, cheesy garlic bread, fried mozzarella triangles, and loaded potato fritters. The fritters were awesome!! The app sampler were the perfect amount of food to get while waiting. The restaurant is outside and they have heaters for when the sun goes down so you don't get cold. The service is great. I can't wait to go back here next time I'm in Vegas!",

Since I knew it would take a while for the pizza and I was starving I went for a salad to start. The harvest greens salad was supposed to come with Bleu cheese, however mine did not. I chose not to address this with the server because he seemed to be taking care of the entire patio and everything was taking even longer than normal (birth the salad and the pizza). The pizza did not disappoint me, but my husband was unhappy with the amount of sausage on his half of the pizza. Still worth it in my opinion, but I only get to have real Chicago pizza about once a year.",

Service was horrendously slow and disorderly.  We had ordered two deep dish pizzas and a thin crust pizza. Our two deep dish pizzas arrived and the thin crust pizza never arrived. It was never made, never started. We complained to management and to my shock, manager threw his entire kitchen staff under the bus and blamed them for the missing thin crust pizza. He even offered to allow us to enter the kitchen to yell at the staff ourselves since he said yelling at them himself has not been effective.  Wtf? Who does that? A place is only as good as their leader and clearly this place was despicable. I felt bad for the waitstaff who had to work with them. The manager not once offered to comp the meal despite part of our group never getting food and having nothing to eat. We mentioned we didn't feel like it is fair that we have to tip since part of us was never served and that manager should cover our tip towards the waitstaff but he did nothing. Stingy manager who treats his staff like nothing. Unacceptable.  Had this been my first ever experience with this pizza chain, I would have vowed to never ever return or try any more of their pizzas. However, I have lived in Chicago and had the real deal multiple times so I know this is an aberration and abomination. I hope the manager either undergoes some major retraining regarding customer service and team leader skills or gets replaced. As is stands, he serves to only tarnish the Giordano's name and ruin people's first impressions of the place.   I personally do not plan on returning unless improvements are made. I do not support management who throw their people under the bus nor do I support management who are unwilling to adequately comp for such an egregious mistake on their part.",

My girlfriend and I were in vegas for a few days so we decided to go we were pretty hungry when we got there which was bad. Reason being was because the average time for a deep dish there is about 45min :( but well worth the wait. We got the \"Chicago Classic\" deep dish(pepperoni, onions, green peppers & mushrooms) this pizza was cheesy and delicious as can be. When they brought the pizza to the table and served us a slice each we witnessed the longest pizza pull (cheese was pulled about 8-10 inches) i highly recommend this place. If you can have a light snack before you'll need room for the pizza :) forgot to mention that our waiter put in the wrong style of pizza so we waited almost double the time for the pizza to be ready (he put in for a thin crust pizza)",

I had great expectations for this spot, but it fell flat on its face harder than Frank Nitty off that rooftop. 40 minute wait off the top for my party of six. Took the option of pre-ordering the pizza since it took 40 minutes to cook. So, by my calculations the pizza and our seats should be ready at the same time.... right? Ummm... no. We were seated, ordered salads and chicken tenders (which turned out to be small round chicken nuggets) and soft drinks. We finished all of that, but the pre-ordered pizza was nowhere to be found. So we waited... and we waited... get the picture. At one point I asked myself what will come first New Years or the pizza. Drinks were not promptly re-filled either. The atmosphere was a bit loud & chaotic. The pizza finally arrived and it was good... not the best I've had but it was tasty. Lastly, I have had few dining experiences where the server promptly gives you the check without asking if you wanted desert or anything else. Wow. The food here is good. Unfortunately, the sub par service leaves a bad taste in your mouth. However, since they just recently opened I will chalk it up as opening day jitters.  Here's an update on my dining experience at Giordano's: I was contacted and invited back by the owner Michael after my initial experience fell short of my expectations. The return visit was simply spectacular! My family was given a superb dining experience with the owner comping our entire meal. The restaurant's manager Evan took care of my party from start to finish. He recommended the bruschetta and had it sent to our table. Right before our pizza was ready he gave us a tour of the kitchen. He's a real pro. Our server Jose was excellent. Drinks were immediately refilled, pizza slices were served to us, and this time dessert was offered. When we needed some extra napkins they appeared on the table faster than what Copperfield could've done. I want to say thank you to the entire staff. Special thanks to the owner Michael for inviting us back and being a caring person who wanted to make our dining experience at his restaurant right. Opening day jitters no more... you guys swung for the fences and made it to home plate!Welcome to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "If you have 2-3 hours to kill, then come eat here, otherwise stay away. I really wished they had a VIP line for 7 star members. Thank goodness for the Tiki Bar downstairs next to the outdoor Giordano's otherwise time would stand still. The wait is ridiculous, and on top of that you have to wait an additional 45 minutes for the pizza. By the time it comes, you're just hungry and for some reason your stomach shrank because you didn't eat on time. The cheese was cool, but I think we were all too hungry to really enjoy it. To me, it was full of tomato sauce and not a lot of toppings. It was an over kill of sauce. The crust was okay. It was more of a cookie crust, so that also made it filling too. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back and if I do, I'll just get it to-go and eat it at the Tiki Bar. I'll also order 1 small to share for a party of 4. But, honestly I don't think I'll be back. There are plenty other great pizza joints in LV.",

Great taste the crust is more like a pie crust good flavor lots and lots of toppings this is an adult pizza at its finest.....",

    "text": "Giordanos pizza is originally from Chicago and people were excited about it coming to Las Vegas.  I live in Utah, so was happy to test it out on a recent visit to town.  After a long fun day of shopping on the Las Vegas strip, we decided to get a Giordanos pie on the way out of town. We decided to get the thin crust pesto chicken pizza, as well as the stuffed deep dish pizza. The overall favorite of the group had to be the thin crust pesto chicken pizza, what flavor! The stuffed deep dish pizza was great as well, but for me it was just a bit too much, but that's just personal preference. Overall Giordanos pizza is an excellent pizza experience on the Las Vegas strip.",

    "text": "I USED to love this place. But the last few times have been unsatisfactory.  The pizza is way over priced for the quality offered. I've been to the actual restaurant in Chicago and this place is not the same quality. The last two times i ordered ahead of time and STILL had to wait an additional 30-40 min once i arrived AT THE TIME IT SAID TO PICKUP .  Then to get the pizza it wasn't as i ordered it and was a little over cooked. The pizza crust was like cardboard.  Spending $22 on a small pizza and for it to be mediocre is never a good thing.  The manager came over to \"fix\" the situation but his solution was to make me wait another long wait time for a pizza. Not a good solution for an already starving family. I ended up keeping it due to the hunger we already were experiencing but i did not fill it was handled properly. He then begrudgingly offers 20% off for THIER mistake which i felt should have been 50% due to the extra long wait and inconvenience of eating a pizza that was not the way i ordered it AHEAD IF TIME.  Needless to say i will not go back again. Very disappointing",

Waitress was ok, restaurant was surprisingly empty for a Friday night and she was pretty inattentive.  Also, our food came out in stages which made it awkward sitting with food in front of half the table.  We did know about the pizza wait and those who didn't order pizza asked for their food to come with the pizza, yet it came out 5 minutes after.",

If it was not for the owner Micheal reaching out to me from my review I probably wouldn't have ever went back. After a little talking back and forth we set up another dining experience. WOW! What a complete difference. From the second we walked in we were greeted well and taken care of like royalty. The Manager Evan was extremely friendly and helpful not only with the service but with recommendations. It was nice to talk it up with him and learn a little about him on a personal level. Our server Daniel was nothing short of charming and extremely attentive. Huge thank you to all the staff for allowing us to go in the back and see the pizza process and a bigger thank you to Micheal for completely changing our opinion on this place and honestly really capping off a great vegas trip with an outstanding meal and amazing people.

We ate in the upstairs portion of the restaurant (there's a downstairs outdoor portion in the Ballys shopping area as well) and the decor was very industrial, the walls I think were garage doors which gave a nice ambiance. Our server was fantastic, energetic, and very knowledgable. He even knew where their farms were that they sourced their dairy and tomatoes from. I ordered their sangria which was inexpensive and strong, I enjoyed it. I had a few because the pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook. We also enjoyed the bruschetta in the meantime. I think I actually heard angels singing when they brought out our pizza and cut the first slice. The cheese oozed absolutely everywhere and I could not wait to take my first bite. For how insane this pizza looks, it's surprisingly light. The crust was almost like a cracker, I don't like pizza crust typically and I could not get enough of it. I'm glad we only a medium because with three people there were still leftovers. Between the excellent service and otherworldly pizza, I'd recommend everyone and anyone get a pie here.",

The girl didn't mention that it was a completely separate reservation for upstairs than the outside seating, and apparently this was for outside seating. She takes us to 2 separate tables of 4 ? Uhm, usually people like to sit together which is why I said 5 ! So she moves us (attitude of course) and we didn't get our waiter to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. By this time it is 9pm, starving. We are ready to order and start with the chicken parm and a deep dish pizza which we were told they were at a 45 minute wait. Ok we can start on the chicken parm, no big deal. About 20 minutes later, he comes back and says oh we are sold out of the chicken parm ! WhAT ?! Ugh reluctantly we replaced it with spaghetti and meatballs and specified we wanted it BEFORE the pizza came out. Again no rush, it took 40 minutes to get the spaghetti and meatballs - which were cold ! I guess they cook it upstairs and bring it down ? It was super windy and cold so I'm sure that is why everything was cold. Finally the pizza comes down and also a bit cold, nothing special. The crust reminds me of a cracker or a tart crust, the sauce is flavorless and the cheese wasn't as gooey as I prefer. Basic plain and nothing to wait 45 minutes for. The waiter never came back after our pizza, we never got refills - nothing. The couple next to us was livid over the lack of service that they left. Finally the bill comes and he says oh I'm sorry we are only taking cash bc the machines are down. Uhhh... what? This day in age NO one carries cash, granted this is Vegas I would carry it if I was going gambling but that wasn't my plan tonight. So I said sorry I only have a card, so he used the old school machine to take an image of the card. Dinner started at 8pm and ended at 10:30pm !! Definitely didn't live up to the hype.",

The dough is crisp and soft in all the right places. There is a ton of cheese, but it's not overpowering. There's something about the proportions of this deep dish which make it delicious. Please come hungry. I had to divide one slice into several meals. Maybe because I had a salad while we waited. This pizza is only for the serious.   If you eat at the upstairs portion of the restaurant, you get pretty nice view of the strip. The space is really cool.  Oh and as others have mentioned, it takes 45 min to 1hour to prep the pizza.",

This location has nice open seating with options of sitting outside down on their \"patio-like\" area or on the second floor of the restaurant. Unlike many of the reviews, our service was responsive and filled in any questions or things we needed to know about the food. For instance, letting us know that an order of deep-dish would take just under hour to prepare.  We went ahead and ordered the Chicago deep-dish pizza. The wait was definitely worth it. Pulling the first slice off the pan, you can tell the cheese is not some generic sprinkle of mozzarella right before it hits the oven. The cheese has a nice bite and pull to it and full of flavor. Their marinara sauce is unique and not too tart, while the crust was cooked all the way through to provide a slight crunch.",

I believe we waited over an hour and a half. The reason for 5 stars is our server and the young man that seated us. They both checked in constantly, aplogized for the wait before we even noticed it and then proceeded to buy us a round of drinks and then ultimately comped our entire meal. Our server even brought us pizzas we hadn't ordered to hold us over as we waited. The setting and ambiance here was amazing and the service was seriously the best I have ever experienced. They truly made our trip and night special when we weren't even concerned about the wait! We will definitely be back everytime we're in Vegas!",

I have had many pizzas that are chicago style and I really like this style, but they all pale in comparison to what we ate tonight.   Giordanos states they started in Chicago & still have a restaurant there.  That's easy to believe because this was the most perfectly cooked Deep Dish Pizza I have ever eaten.   We ordered a medium create your own with Pepperoni, Italian Sausage. Bacon, Mushrooms & Olives.  They warned us that it would take about 45 minutes, which was fine as 1). This tells me it is made to order & 2.). It's Vegas, no rush!   Since the medium feeds 3-4 people and there are only two of us, we didn't order appetizers.  We started with a pitcher of beer because hey.  Pizza & Beer!    The crust was flaky like they coated the pan in butter and it soaked in (YUM!).  The sauce was chunky, tomatoey goodness.  Crisp edges , not too doughy or thick and amazing gooey cheesy goodness !  I have got to start working on how to replicate this!    If you love pizza, you have got to try this.  BTW, the service is great as well (I got lost in remembering the tasty goodness to talk about the service.).",

Before going, I called for details on having 20 plus people and what that entails as I know that would be easier for knowing cost, not having to wait if at all possible and convenience. Starting with mgmt, they were very helpful in answering all my questions and making sure all the details were spot on for food, drinks and time.  When it came to the actual day, Dominick L was phenomenal! Outside of the food package, any drinks or other related costs was not an issue. If we needed something, he was there right away, courteous and gave excellent recommendations on drinks.

The thinner one takes 20min.  Also had the Buffalo Wings.  Equally awesome!  Garlic bread... awesome!  Sat at the bar and their service was terrific.  And they have tv's all over the place.  This is especially great if you are staying at Bally's since it's right there at the top of the escalators from the Bally's promenade shops.",

But order was incorrect. Manager Jesse says he has to take incorrect pizza back. I ask what he's going to do with it? Trash it he says.  Wasted perfectly good food when it was servers fault for wrong order. To my face he says trash it. Perfectly good food.  I had been in Vegas a week and a half before my gf showed up. Had been looking forward to Giordano's for weeks.  I'll never go back. Jesse has a problem with his establishment and management should act swiftly and quickly.  Thumbs down. Horrible to be put in blame for sup sup par service. Shame on you Jesse",

After anticipated hour, pizza came, thin crust...asked the bartender and was referred to the manager. Today DICK. No moment he looked me in the  eye or waited to hear anything about  my order, even after the wait I wasn't upset about it...what made me upset was Jessie, the manager, who blamed ME immediately for the mis-order, and then INSPECTED MY PLATE to see if I had bitten the misdelivered pizza. Weird. I had taken one single bite...wanted to charge me for the whole stone pizza while rudely demanding I wait ANOTHER HOUR for the actual pizza I'd ordered.   I love this place. I never leave bad reviews, but this champ really ruined my night.",

I have never had a deep dish because I've always wanted to try it the right way, which was to eat it in Chicago. Im super glad I came to this place. This is how you eat pizza! We ordered a small to split between us and still had 3 slices left. It was like a freaking pie with cheese filling and what ever toppings you wanted!!!!! I can't stop thinking about this pizza. They do make their pizza fresh so it was about a 40 minute wait but when you have good company and a drink, it doesn't feel like you are waiting long. I love the cheese pull too! Makes it fun to snap a photo or record your cheese pull game. I love how it's on the strip. It's a very happening place. We went on a Thursday night in October. The wait was about 10 minutes. Kinda of a tight space but waiting for that pizza was so worth it! Oh I did have the house salad and it was good too! Yummm...",

The pizza was extremely cheesy and tomatoey and paired well with a nice ale. The 12\" is definitely more than enough for two people unless you guys are famished.  Service was exceptional.

The food tastes exactly like back in Chicago! The views from the second floor restaurant are amazing. You have a panoramic view of the Bellagio water fountains, caesars palace, drais, and the shopping area down below. The furniture fixtures and lighting in the restaurant gives customers a feel for good ol' Americana food. Pizza took about 45 minutes to make (as with any deep dish pizza). They were having a promotion where they gave free chicken wings. Also, if you sign up for their email list on yelp you can get free cheesy bread or tomato bruschetta. My friend and i ordered the medium meat n more meat deep dish with added mushrooms. By the time the pizza came out, my friend and i could only eat one slice each because the pizza is so filling. We were happy to take home six slices to eat later that night. Giordanos is the best deep dish pizza out there!",

Imagine a pie with two inches of cheese inside. The sauce was also pretty good.   If you are completely against deep dish style pies, they do have a selection of regular thin crust pies.  The bruschetta was very good and the table next to us got the garlic cheese bread which look very good as well.  Be prepared to wait, it takes 45 minutes to an hour to cook a pie. They recommend you order the pie as soon as you sit down and they put it in and the waiter comes back to order appetizers after the pie is in.  Definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of deep dish or have never tried it",

    "text": "I had been waiting years for this pizza again! I was panicked that they would not be open and to my surprise they were open till 2am according to Yelp. Finally my boyfriend and I walk in at 11pm last night..we meet the hostess who was very sweet and had a great personality in regards to which pizza we should get.. because they offer 6 in pizzas you can pick up on the spot or wait for larger ones for 45 min! So we sit at the bar and start a convo with the bartender from Colorado?.. who was super nice. The manager comes out and strikes up a convo about their bruschetta over the cheese bread so we put in our order..(he's as gracious as can be) I mean I can't tell you enough how nice this guy is.. he was very informative about his menu and explained all about the process of making their dough similar to Chicago's because in Chicago they use Michigan water.. their dough making process alone shows how far they are willing to go to make sure you are getting the real Giordanos! He gave us both a very good vibe..the place was very clean, they played GREAT old school music..we didn't want to get up! So while we waited for our pizza we decided to eat our bruschetta there and then striked up a convo with another guy who wore his hair in a bun on top like me..super awesome personality! He was from Venice, CA. They all seemed to love their job and they did it well..so we finally get our pizza and we'll just look at the pics..the pizza was amazing! The one thing about Giordanos is their sauce for me and the sauce was the exact same as Chicago! The dough was close but I'm telling you, it's still the best pizza I've ever had and I'm so excited that they are only a few hours away which is doable for me because yes, I would drive here for their nice cheesy and rich, saucy, piping fresh hot deep dish pizza! The bruschetta was good but needed more basil and garlic in the tomatoes and not just on the crispy bread so I wouldn't order that again, the customer service knocks it out of the ballpark! We even got a couple of their cups for purchase to remember our night from.. will definitely be back and soooo worth the $25 bucks for a large!!! You won't regret it!",

It was good but it seemed like it wasn't made fresh it seemed tough and like it was a frozen pizza. But I give the place 4 stars because the service was excellent and the server was very attentive and the ambience of the restaurant and decor were great!!

This is problem I have and it may not be yours. Have you ever had pizza that was so good that you could eat the whole thing yourself and eat the leftovers for a week? Well I have and this place Isn't like that. I had one good piece and I was so sick of it that it wasn't even funny.I really don't care to go back. Just very over rated! I'm not saying the food wasn't good. It was very good! But when you have to wait 45 minutes for a pizza to cook and your spending 7 dollars a beer and their hustling to get you to spend more money on other stuff by the time the pizza comes your full and broke. 1 pizza a salad, chicken wings, coke, and a few beers was close to a 100 dollars for two.. that fucking pizza better give me an orgasm or something.. (one time is ok but I won't drive to the strip again for it) Just saying!!",

    "text": "First I would like to state that I Love Giordanos!!!! When it comes to Deep Dish/Stuffed Pizza no other pizzeria in Chicago comes close in my opinion. I was born & raised in Chicago & I have been a loyal customer of theirs for over 30 years. My wife & I were thrilled that they were opening a location here in Las Vegas. The restaurant itself is amazing, with a large indoor dining room upstairs  featuring a great view of the strip & Bellagio fountains. There is also a large outdoor Dining & Bar area downstairs. Our waitress was a bit lackluster considering this was their first day being open to the general public. She asked us if we have ever been there before (strange since it was their first day being open) & we told her we have been to multiple locations in Chicago but our first time to this location. My wife & I seemed more excited than she was & I really expected more representing Giordanos brand new Las Vegas Location. We ordered a large stuffed cheese pizza with Meatballs. When our pizza arrived we noticed there was about half the amount of cheese that is usually on the pizza & the meatballs were 1/4 the size of what we had in Chicago on our most recent visit last year (See photos below for comparison). The crust & sauce were on par with what we expect with the crust being even lighter & flakier than usual. If you have never been to Giordanos you might not notice but we expected the excellence & consistency we have always experienced at multiple locations. We also purchased 2 frozen pizzas to go which came in a insulated bag for traveling. The only issue is even though they were listed on the menu at our table our server told us we had to go outside & downstairs to a small window to purchase them which was an inconvenience & a bit lacking on customer service. The girl at the take out window was very friendly though. No breaded mushrooms on the appetizer selection & loud rap music in the dining area were also a negative but could be easily overlooked if the Pizza was up to the high standards we have always enjoyed. I Really wanted to give a 5 star rating more than I ever have to any restaurant but I have to go with a solid 3 1/2 not quite a 4. Hopefully they turn it around since it is early in the game for them. I need to lose a few pounds so I can go to the beach this summer so maybe one less temptation is a good thing??  I took Giordanos up on their offer of a return visit (which I would rarely to for bad experiences at most restaurants), & I am really glad I did. Michael M. Who is the Regional Director of Operations hosted myself & two guests. He was genuinely concerned about my experience & my concerns about the consistency of their stuffed meatball pizza & sat with us for over 20 minutes. Michael made us two Pizzas when we came back, one with the Jumbo size meatballs they use for their entrees & one with the smaller pieces of meatballs which they have been doing for comparison. Michael is a Chicago guy & we had a great interaction with him during our return visit. He has recently e-mailed me to let me know they have come up with a meatball which is smaller than the size they use for their entrees & would like me to come by & offer my input!!! WOW!!! I stated in the first sentence of my original review how much I Love Giordanos & I am happy to know that the man in charge of my favorite Chicago pizza's entry to the west coast region exceeds my passion for their product.",

My point, if you LOVE Giordano's this is a real Giordano's  if you have never had it, get a personal size pizza and dip your toe in the water, be prepared to wait about a hour for the pizza to cook",

It does take awhile for the deep dish, so we orderd apps and salads while waiting. Everything was good. The deep dish was good but based off reviews was expecting it to be the best ever. I wasn't disappointed just unimpressed.  Service: They definitely had their B team on when I dined. The hosts did not greet us as we walked in and talked amongst themselves for a minute before acknowledging us and then didn't really converse with us and just walked us to the table, it was an odd encounter. Our server was great, but no team service. He kept our drinks full and ensured we had everything we needed. His service saved the hospitality part of the review. The team around him seem disengaged and unaware.",

    "text": "I sat at the bar with no wait. There's an upstairs inside and a downstairs outside. The service was okay...the bar guy wasn't the most pleasant but did get everything correct.   The cheesy garlic bread was okay, but the middle portion seemed to be undercooked/underbroiled...so there was a cold grey mess in those parts.   I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo, which was actually linguine Alfredo. The sauce was a notch above bland, seems like it was missing Parmesan cheese and garlic. The pasta was also a tad below al dente, so a bit hard to eat. The little piece of bread that came with it was pretty dry.   My companion ordered a personal deep dish, it came out in less the 45 min quote time. It looks as advertised. I've had this in the Chicago location, but since I'm not a fan of deep dish, I wouldn't really recommend it. The crust is just as dry.   The clientele is the population of Chicago teleported to this location. Only people that have been there would come here.",

We ordered a salad & potato fritters to start (so bomb), we shared alfredo pasta & spaghetti, and finished our meal with a deep dish Chicago pizza. Everything was delicious!   However, it was odd that no one who worked here was friendly. The hostess was not friendly or hospitable. I asked the bartender if he could make a few cocktails? A French 75 which is champagne, gin, little simple syrup, with a lemon twist - blunt no. No other recommendations or alternative suggestions? And our waitress was accommodating, but not overly so. It was peculiar that no one we interacted with that worked here was nice. This is your job and a smile goes a long way.   With that being said, when I come back to Las Vegas I would for sure eat here again. The food was great & the atmosphere awesome. Live Las Vegas!",

There is a spot where you can order pizza and sit outside but it was freezing in January and we decided to go inside. The wait was about 20 minutes. We decided then we just wanted to eat at the bar. The bartender let us know that it would be up to 45 minutes before we got our pizza. I heard him explaining to another couple at the bar who was very angry because they noted other people had their pizza first. I didn't mind waiting we ordered the bbq wings and those were so good! Lots of flavor and meat on the chicken! Service was soso but the pizza came out we ordered the meats pizza and loved it. I took a video and everybody kept asking me where it was. The view is really nice from the bar you can see the Bellagio fountains! If you don't mind waiting I definitely recommend trying the deep dish pizza!",

    "text": "Spending a few years growing up in Chicago where the family is from, deep-dish pizza was our jam. In the Chicago pizza war that includes Lou Malnatti's, Gino's East (boooooo!), and Giordano's (yaaaayyyy!) - I think it's pretty obvious who wins. I'm so happy for a slice of Chicago to land in Vegas. First, it was Garrett's popcorn and now, this! OMG! And I haven't been back to Chi-town in years. I digress.  Anyway, I must say that I actually prefer New York pizza than Chicago pie. But if I must eat deep-dish pizza, it has to be Giordano's hands down. The crust can withstand all the sauce and all the fabulous ingredients. Once you take that first slice of pie, ooey gooey nice and melty cheese just taunts you \"eat me!!!\" I can eat a whole New York pizza by myself. Try doing that with a Chicago pizza - I have yet to witness that! I can only do 2 slices because of how big and thick each slice is.  Sometimes, I like a chicken fettuccine alfredo on the side. Huge portions here so, come hungry. I like the fact that their pizza tastes the same as it would in Chicago. BTW, their pies take a little longer to cook (ummm...because they're thick) so, if you're in a hurry, take your whiney booty to Peeksa Hut.",

Thick Chicago Style: it was defiantly cheesy and doughy, the crust was flaky / pie-like.. But overall too much dough for me.",

I had high expectations and honestly for way cheaper I've had better pizza but it's all about personal preference. The servers were nice though and the place crowded a little loud very family oriented. I would recommend it just for the experience but definitely thought it was going to be way better. To me it just tasted like a layered lasagna. Very cheesy though so that was good. I wouldn't go back there just cause I didn't like it and felt it wasn't worth it.",

We ordered the same thing as last time which was a medium thin pepperoni and a small deep dish special. Unlike our last experience, this time around the deep dish had plenty of onions, mushrooms, peppers, and sausages. Of course the amount of mozzarella cheese was insane! The thin crust gave you a mouth full of pepperoni in every bite. Yes, you have to wait a while for the any deep dish order but there are some things that are worth the wait and this is one of them.  We even tried the house salad and the cheesy garlic bread. Both were excellent starting appetizers to get your palette started. Afterwards we all shared a chocolate cake which lasted all of 50 seconds. Should we have ordered our own? No. Although my kids would have loved it, I have to put my foot down sometime. Just because you can doesnt mean you should.  Our server Goose did everything that was expected of a good server and then some. Even the manager Nick stopped by several times to make sure everything was ok.  In closing, most people complain that they dont get enough cheese on their pizza. Here you just might complain that its too much and thats not necessarily a bad thing. As a local, I usually try to stay away from the strip for obvious reasons but Giordano's is only one of the select few that me and the fam know that its worth going to.

The service was great.  I ate at the outside bar restaurant and watched a bad baseball game while waiting.  The Diamondbacks won.  I hate them..  Ok, back to the review.  The pizza was so good.  I was by myself so I ordered the personal pan pizza with pepperoni, sausage, bacon and extra cheese.  Oh my!  So amazing.  Did I mention it was a party in my mouth?  It was.  My mouth started to water before the pizza reached it.  Yes, just me drooling all over the excellent pizza.  So good.  Well done GIordanos!",

    "text": "Adam and I were walking along the strip during the day when the smells of this place got us. We knew immediately that we would be coming here for dinner because we knew we could not be disappointed.   We did not make any reservations and came on a Friday evening around 7:30 PM. We were able to be seated right away at their outdoor seating which is exactly where we wanted to be seated.   We were able to browse the menu and pick out our drinks and our pizza by the time the waitress came. We ordered the Meat and More Meat deep dish pizza and we both got cocktails. We were told from the very beginning that since we were ordering a deep dish pizza it would take around 45-60 minutes to receive our pizza. We have ordered deep dish at other places so we knew this was the case and we were okay with it. It took right at the 60 minute mark to get our food and let me tell you... it was worth the wait!!! There was a perfect ratio of every single topping and it wasn't too salty either. Being that it was deep dish we weren't able to eat a whole bunch because one slice is so filling but we both ate 2 slices and had left overs that we ate the next day.   The reason why I won't give it five stars is because of the wait staff. I felt our waitress could be a bit quicker and a bit more attentive. We were done eating and ready for our pizza to be boxed up and given the bill and we had to wait for nearly 10 minutes for her to show up. Once she did every step seemed to take far too long. I understand part of the issue is that everything has to be ran from the restaurant to the outside area but somethings shouldn't take long. We were there for over 2 hours which is a long time, even when you are waiting for deep dish pizza.   Overall, we had a great time, and I would recommend coming. The food was amazing but the wait staff could have been quicker. I think if we come back here we will eat inside of the main restaurant with hopes that service will be quicker because the staff doesn't have to run inside for everything.",

    "text": "Best Italian food I've had in a restaurant for a very long time.  Prices were very reasonable for the area.  Sizable portions too.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they do not serve bread or rolls with entree.  They do sell Garlic Toast as an appetizer, however a basket of garlic knots, or even a sub roll warm and sliced (they have meatball sub on menu) would of satisfied us.  The waiter brought us saltine crackers.  I am extremely critical of most attempts at restaurant meatballs but these were fantastic!  Good balanced meat sauce, lasagna was excellent as was the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli.  When at Ballys skip Buca di Peppo and hit this place.  It's famous for it's thick stuffed pizza but we opted for classic Italian meals and we were very happy we did.",

They gave me raw chicken on my salad, so they gave it to me for free and brought a whole different salad which was just okay. We ordered cheese bread to tide us over for the hour it takes to bake these pizzas. It came out cold. We got our pizza and it was over baked and the crust was burnt. Hardly any meat in it at all. We picked a standard pizza on hand so it would go faster. This is not our favorite Chicago style pizza place to begin with so we did not have high expectations going in so we were totally disappointed with the food.  We did however get be awesome cheese pull! That was a positive I guess. Wouldn't go back.",

We even called in advance to make them aware we were coming.   The frustration was once we were seated, (In three different groups 8/4/4) there were multiple empty tables nearby. Then the person bringing out the pizza put them at wrong tables. Wouldn't fix his mistake so we had to move them around ourselves.   So I suggest that you don't bring a large group.",

Have you seen those pictures on the Internet of the incredibly string-cheesy pizza that looks like it will absolutely fulfill everything that's missing in your life? That's how Giordanos pizza looks when it arrives at your table. Make sure to snap the Instagram photo and post it before you take your first bite, that way other people can live vicariously through you before the disappointing reality sets in. You wait 45min-1hr for the pizza that is lukewarm and tastes like someone who never tasted real pizza tried to invent a pizza from scratch.   Although that is okay because the horribly inattentive wait staff makes the disappointing pizza the second biggest problem. You literally cannot get helped in a restaurant where there's only three seated tables. Do yourself a favor and spend the time fighting your way through the crowds to take a picture with a half-naked cowboy. You'll get more meat in that picture than you will on your pizza.",

    "text": "Ah Giordano's my old friend. I lived in Chicago and used to appreciate all of the classics: Pizzeria Uno, Due, Gino's East, and of course Giordano's. It's nice to have one of the latter a little closer to home.  We had a late lunch on a Saturday and typical of Giordano's, they warned us that any deep dish pizza would take 40-50 minutes to bake. Not sure if they do it at this location but i know at some of the Chicago places they take your order ahead of time while you're in line, that way you don't end up waiting all that long for your food after you've been seated. Nonetheless we were seated right away and given the time warning at our table.  Since I can never agree with anyone on toppings (i.e. I don't like 20 things on or in my my pizza) I just got one of the individual deep dish pizzas. I got my pie stuffed with bell peppers and sausage which go perfectly with the sweet tomato sauce, the gooey cheese, and the flakey crust.  I typically frequent a thinner style of pizza so for me a deep dish is a splurge. The pie is basically filled with cheese, sauce, and any extras and baked to golden perfection. The individual pie can seem small and like it won't be enough food when it first arrives, but it's not a problem when you realize how filling each slice is.  The inside of the restaurant is considerably more modern than some of the Chicago locations which are more home style and have lots of wood paneling. The main restaurant is on the second floor of the Bally's casino at the entrance. There was also a to-go order window on the first floor right below, and a separate enclosed patio-type area with barstools, tables, and people watching opportunities in the Grand Bazaar Shops.  As expected in Vegas there's a considerable markup so we paid about $40 for 2 individual pizzas and drinks. If you've never had a Chicago deep dish definitely put this on your list, and if you have, it's a great place to re-visit.",

    "text": "Had a very good experience at Giordano's Pizza. It only took us about 20 minutes to get seated at the table, and we also pre-order the pizza before we went to our table in order to expedite the process of obtaining our food.  The pizza we went with was the meat and more meat, AKA meat lovers Pizza. I also tried their soup of the day which was okay, I forgot the name of the soup.  Unfortunately even though we ordered the pizza in advance, we still didn't get it until about an hour after we sat down. So it took our Pie about an hour and a half to finally make it to us total.  Of course it was worth the wait in the end, even if it was a little longer than we had hoped. The pizza came out fantastic and two slices definitely filled me up haha.  Afterwards I ordered the Apple Pan pie, but unfortunately they were out for the night just my luck. I then opted instead to try their salted caramel cookie, and it was good. Reminded me a lot of BJ's Brewhouse Pizookie, but I would say that it was better than BJ's Brewhouse is pizookies.  Our server was incredibly kind and attentive, she made sure to consistently check up on us and ensure that all our needs were attended to.  The bathrooms were also well-managed, clean and smell nice.  The Acoustics inside the building itself or rather garbage, however as it's a sports bar style restaurant it's not too surprising.  4/5  The only cons being the wait and the requested dessert not being available.",

So the top is a layer is pizza sauce, below the sauce is whatever topping you want, then a very very thick layer of cheese and then the crust.

    "text": "I am a huge fan for Chicago deep dish pizza so I had to come here while staying in Vegas. It's located just a few feet down Flamingo Road from the Las Vegas Blvd strip. Close to Bally's. Anyway there's an outside location which is very hot with no AC. And then there is the restaurant upstairs.  From the first floor it looks closed. They should really have signs to tell people to take the escalator upstairs. Ordered the sampler plate, house salad, classic deep dish and sangria. Sampler plate was just okay, tasted like a bunch of microwaved things you would buy at the grocery store. House salad was fresh and tasty. Sangria tasted good too. The pizza was the usual deep dish, but the sauce lacked flavor usually found in places liked Gino's in Chicago, Zachary's in the Bay Area, or Masa in LA.",

Well...that wasn't quite the case.  I was staying at the Bellagio so I decided to try the one across the street. Kind of a weird setup - outdoor seating/bar with the kitchen somewhere offsite. The servers were less than friendly, not welcoming at all. I mean come on, you're in a huge tourist attraction, it would better serve you to at least be fake nice   I was so excited for my pizza, I knew exactly what I wanted. So I ordered my create-your-own. I thought afterwards: I wonder if the waiter knew I wanted the stuffed pie instead of regular.  When I stopped him moments later to confirm, he gave me a bit of an attitude and said, \"We don't serve that after 10pm.\" Well that would have been nice to know, perhaps at least printed somewhere on the menu.  Regardless, I got a \"regular\" pizza with my usual toppings. It was still good (not the great pie I was expecting) but I was highly disappointed in the service and lack of food options.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to bypass this establishment and find a Giordano's elsewhere.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is a melting pot of worldwide cuisine. The City of Entertainment rewards its residents and guests with outposts of  restaurants that serve cuisine from a different part of the world. This includes sushi restaurants, Emeralds from New Orleans, eateries serving lobster rolls, Grimaldi's from New York, and Giordanos from Chicago. Living in Las Vegas it is spectacularly awesome to find out that a cool restaurant that I visited in another city has come to my adopted city. Giordanos is a perfect example. It is hard to believe that it was in July of 2014, when I dined in the 130. East Randolph, Chicago Giordanos. At the time that I dined in the Chicago location, this one was a flowerbed besides the Bally's walkway. In a couple of years Giordanos would follow me to Vegas.    The Las Vegas Strip Giordanos (there is a second Las Vegas location in Summerlin) is truly two different restaurants sharing the Grand Bazaar. At street level there is a 1,178 square foot partially enclosed patio location in the middle of the Grand Bazaar promenade that joins the Strip to Bally's. Nearby there is the upper level 4,000 square foot location above Starbuck's where the top of the escalor transitions into the people mover into Bally's. I have always dined in the 4,000 square foot restaurant.   Upon walking into Giordanos there is the usual friendly hostess. A few times she has nicely informed us of a short wait. In back of the hostess is a plate glass window overlooking the kitchen. There are zero tables overlooking the place where people bring the pizza to life. However there are seats overlooking TVs where athletes bring professional sports to life. This is the bar just past the hostess. Further into the large upper level space that feels like an oversized loft with its warehouse ceilings are tables that overlook a grand view across the Grand Bazaar into the Fountains of the Bellagio. Quite a few times we had been fortunate enough to have this view. Especially taking into consideration that the average wait time for a deep dish pizza is 45 minutes and thin crust is 30. We had yet to sit by the farthest wall overlooking the \"Eat Pizza\" sign.    Giordanos is a melting pot of delectable dough, sauce, mouth watering cheese that is drooling delicious that you can stretch and hold it. The pizza is the heart of the menu. Giordanos is known for their deep dish pizza. However, I have taken a liking to their thin crust pizza. The thin crust reminds me of the New York pizza that I grew up with. It is a melting pot that is easy on the wallet. One of the many nice things about this place is that the prices are comparable to off the Strip. The small thin crust pie costs $14.25. I will let you in on something. The small pie is genuinely large. There are 12 slices. An added on vegetable costs $1.90 where an added on protein costs $2.85. I always order mushrooms. What surprises me is that I am more fond of the pizza here than I was in their home town Chicago outpost that I rated three stars. Branching away from the pizza, I had tried their Meatball subs with fries. No complaints about it.  With the Chicago born pizza, I order a bottomless Pepsi.    As I said before, the wait averages 30 minutes for a thin crust and 45 for a thick crust. If you are with good company or your device is fully charged the wait will go fast. From my experience the window overlooking the Grand Bazaar to the Fountains of Bellagio or the TVs accelerates the delayed moments. Also speaking from my experience at their competitor Grimaldi's, Giordanos would improve the wait time by serving house bread.   Based on my personal experiences dining in Giordanos, it has been a tasty addition to the Las Vegas melting pot. Never had I encountered a miserable server or poor service. When I have been the mood for Pizza on the Strip, Giordanos is a restaurant that I trust.   Giordanos FTW (For the World).",

Also a great change of pace from buffets, steak dinners and fancy places to dine. We sat in the patio area with  great view of people watching and good food. Remember, the deep dish takes extra time so if you don't want to wait around for pizza for for the regular crust. Though I do recommend the deep dish!",

He was very prompt & accurate with my order. I have visited when they first opened and then 4-5 times a year but each and every time the order was incorrect and/or the server was barely present. I actually never wanted to come back after my last visit last October when my order was entered as a deep dish instead of thin crust & we had to wait 90 mins for a all meat thin crust. After having Jhon as a server I will definitely return & this establishment needs to have other servers mirror Jhon as he is an absolute asset to the business.",

    "text": "This review could've started really bad. We put in an online order and it didn't go through, so we showed up and nothing was waiting for us. Keep in mind that deep dish take 30-45 minutes to make.  We ended up opting for dining-in and this was probably the best decision for our family of 5. We were seated promptly and had an incredible waiter named Dominick. Initially, we ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni, 1/2 BBQ and 1/2 Buffalo wings, and fries, but we wanted a salad instead of the fries. The salad was actually really good, I could've done without the blue cheese, but we had ranch from the wings to balance it our. The Buffalo wings were kinda spicy and the BBQ wings were really good.  Now onto the pizza, we went for half sausage and half pepperoni. I've had deep dish in San Francisco at some popular spots like Little Star and Patxi, but I would rank Giordanos in third place. This isn't saying that the pizza isn't good, but it just isn't as comparable. However, it definitely will meet your cravings and the service here is pretty remarkable.  Overall, we spent $96 including tip, which isn't too pricy, considering we went for wings and a salad as well as all got a drink. A large pizza fed our family of 5 and we had 4 pieces to take home! We will definitely be returning and hopefully we get the same waiter because it was such a phenomenal experience.",

I loved the chicken-bites (so well seasoned!) and their bruschetta, so delicious (everything else on the sampler was awesome as well, but those 2 were especially memorable).  Our small deep dish pizza fed us for 2 days (we took it to death valley)!  I love the option of a \"build your own pizza\", this way everything in there is just the way you like it. Through a glass wall, you can watch the busy workers throwing pizza dough and baking non-stop.  I like that you can ship frozen pizza pies home, but I think it's pretty pricey.   Everyone there was friendly, explained things to us and the food was really good! I'm not a big sports fan and the big TVs are pretty annoying, but for that I brought lovely company to keep myself entertained!",

It was after 11p so we were seated outside in the smoldering heat. I'd advise they put some fans out there or something. It's kind of uncomfortable to be eating out in the heat.   Our waitress was very polite and professional. I didn't get her name but she was a young blonde from Jersey.   I ordered the sampler, a thin crust pizza, fettuccine pasta and a side or Cesar salad. The sampler was okay. The only thing I liked was the crispy chicken. My least favorite was the cheesy bread. The thin crust pizza reminded me of my elementary school pizza. Tasted like a cardboard box, just like I remembered. I would stay far away from that and judging by the reviews on here I'd probably stay away from the deep dish pizza if you don't want to wait an hour and a half for it. The fettuccine pasta was okay. The flavor of the Alfredo was very bland.   Overall, it wasn't worth what I spent. I'm actually praying I don't get sick from the food and for sudden memory loss so I forget I even came here.  3 stars for my waitress tho, give her a raise!",

    "text": "I had heard a lot about this place and their famous deep dish pizza and finally thought of trying it in Vegas. Located in the strip at central location you will find this place crowded. We visited this place at 10 pm in the night and had to wait for around 10 mins to get seated. Since the deep dish pizza takes an hour to cook we decided to order an appetizer which was mozzarella triangles if I remember it correctly. Then came the supper veggie deep dish pizza after a long wait loaded with cheese and veggies and their flavorful, delicious marinara sauce. We were a party of 4 and had ordered a medium one which serves 8 slices. The pizza is really heavy and 2 slices per person are more than enough to eat. I should say I loved the deep dish pizza and as I meantioned their marinara sauce is so yum yum. It was crispy and cheesy.I enjoyed every bite of it and would recommend you to give it a try too!",

This place did not disappoint and tasted just like it did in Chicago.  The place lies between a row of shops on each side and for the most part is an open-air eatery. With just a roof and half clear walls, makes you feel like you are eating outside. I enjoyed it.  Service was great, our server left us know how long to expect our pizza, which on the average is about 45 minutes since these things are big.   Worth the wait and your belly will thank you for it.",

Only negative is, it says please allow 45 minutes for deep dish which is fine but then thin should take 20-25 min so we ordered to have our thin first followed by the deep dish. Unfortunately, it took way longer than this so don't go if you're super impatient! :)",

So, I came for dinner, with wife, nephew, and future niece in tow.  How long a strand of Mozzarella Cheese stayed intact upon extension was indeed impressive.  But before savoring a pizza, I elected to begin with really cheesy Fried Mozzarella Triangles and Calamari & More: fried calamari, onions and Green Peppers.  The Green Peppers and onion dominated the dish, but it was nevertheless very good served with a mild Marinara Sauce.  Then a fairly large bowl of Chopped Salad was very satisfying, with lettuce, tomatoes, scallions, bacon, red cabbage, pieces of chicken breast, Bleu Cheese crumbles, bits of pasta, peas, and a mild Honey Mustard Dressing.  For my entree I selected a Medium Stuffed Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza.  It smoked and bubbled nicely from high heat, and featured a mild Tomato Sauce, tasty pepperoni, real mushrooms, and of course great pulling cheese.  I packed away three slices, gave away two more, and took three slices home for a memorable lunch the next day.    Service was quick and efficient, and the indoor/outdoor setting casual and  comfortable.  Authentic Deep Dish Chicago Pizza can truly be found here in the center of The Strip.",

The server was a little slow to take out drink order. While she was taking it, we told her we were ready to make our food order. She blew us off with a \"no, not yet\" and went to service another table.  After we got our food order in it took a while to get food. We did get our drinks refilled in a timely manner.  We had appetizers first. The calamari was good, but nothing amazing. The Buffalo Wings had a good flavor, and they weren't too hot. A great balance.  The pizzas were dynamic (Note: I'm normally a thin crust fan). The deep dish pizzas were delicious. The cheese blend was right on. The sauce was fresh tasting, but not overpowering. The crust was good, but that is very subjective. I like mine a little doughier than Giordano's. A couple slices and you will be filled. Even our most aggressive eaters only got down four slices off a medium pizza.  If you are close, stop in or grab a pie to go. I think you'll be happy that you did!",

Arriving at the restaurant on a weekday somewhere between lunch and dinner meant there was no line or no waiting and we were seated right away.  My first thoughts was how really clean and modern the restaurant looked.   Despite being at an odd time on a weekday the restaurant was still mostly filled.  We were waited on promptly and started out by ordering an order of their Buffalo wings.  A short time later some very delicious looking wings came out and wow, they tasted even better than they looked.  In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say these are probably the best Buffalo wings I've had anywhere.  Very surprising as I was not really expecting it.  We went ahead and placed our order for one Chicago deep dish pizza (small) with sausage and pepperoni.  Our waitress informed us the wait would be, at minimum 45 minutes, which i was aware of having ordered deep dish pizza before.  So the long wait for the delicious pizza began.  Normally this is the part where one would drink beer and watch some sports but being in Vegas for a few days I had had my fill of beer so we just chit chatted and waited for the pizza.  While we were waiting the waitress did a great job of giving us refills on our tea and water and the manager, Eric Hamilton, was even nice enough to come and ask us how we had liked our wings.  I chatted with Eric a bit and he had noticed I was wearing a Buckeye shirt so he started to tell me about the Polaris opening, which I thought was nice.  He told us he'd come back and check on us when the pizza came out.    Eventually, right on schedule, about 45 minutes in, the pizza arrive and wow, did it look spectacular!  Eric, the manager, actually came over and got our slices out and that allowed me to take some fantastic shots of all the cheesy goodness.  The first bite of the pizza proved that it tasted even better than it looked and all I could think of was wow, it's a good thing Giordano's is coming a ways away from where I live in Columbus or I'd be eating this a lot more often than I should!  It really was just that great.  The cheese was plentiful, it was very saucy and the sausage and pepperoni were just amazing.  It was everything I had expected it to be and more and we were very happy with it.  The Chicago deep dish is so much more filling and we couldn't actually finish the entire small pizza, so we took the last slice with us to give to a lucky homeless guy.    The entire experience was awesome and I loved all of their food.  We will definitely be going to check out Giordano's once it comes to Columbus, this spring, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to try it. Just a tip too, there is a Giordano's bar on the street that we were not sure if they served pizza or if it was just a bar.  You can get pizza there, we just didn't see anyone getting pizza while we were down there so we went up into the restaurant to eat.  If the weather is nice, give it a try!",

    "text": "It was a glorious Easter Sunday. Jesus had resurrected from the dead, and heck, I was even willing to give Giordano's another shot despite the last subpar experience. That's right. Even after I said that I would rather have BJ's deep dish pizza than eat this again.   My wife and I started off with a couple appetizers including the Caesar salad, Bruschetta, and Calamari. The Bruschetta was the steal of the night, quite possibly the best Bruschetta I've ever had! It was toasted flawlessly and topped off abundantly with mozzarella cheese and diced tomatoes drizzled with a balsamic reduction. The tomatoes were so robust and flavorful, and my mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. The Caesar salad was also a great starter, light and refreshing, and the ingredients were all very fresh. The calamari was battered to perfection, and the marinara sauce was rich and tasty. What puzzled me however was that there were fried green beans and lemon peels in the calamari dish as well. The lemon peel was very unique, unlike anything I've ever had; it tasted like a lemon chip with a zesty kick at the end!   On to the pizza. For those of you who haven't had Chicago-style deep dish pizza, don't come to Giordano's expecting a traditional pizza where the dough is soft and fluffy. An accurate description of their deep dish pizza would be somethin more along the lines of a pie, a savory one that is. Last occasion, my wife and I tried \"The Special\" stuffed deep dish pizza, but this time, we decided to go with a classic deep dish pepperoni sprinkled with some garlic. And oh boy, the pizza was freakin delicious! The marinara sauce was so much more delectable this time, and the crust wasn't as hard nor fragile. The cheese was super cheesy and gooey, and the garlic also really enhanced the overall flavor of the pizza.   Lastly, we concluded the night with an order of the cannoli, and to put it simply, it was interesting. The fried shell had the texture of an egg roll or fried wonton, and the cream inside the shell was like a whipped cheese. It's not sweet so they drizzle some dark chocolate syrup to give it some sweetness. I enjoyed it, but a great addition with the cannoli, in my opinion, would be a scoop of vanilla ice cream (even though it is not traditional in any sense lol).   Giordano's, I just wanna take my hat off to you guys, because I was thoroughly impressed with the food this time! The service was also impeccable despite how busy the restaurant was. You guy have proved me wrong, and I can't wait for my next visit! (And for that Bruschetta)",

When it comes to the pizza, I was extremely disappointed. The crust was dry and crispy but not in a good way. It's reminiscent of the crackly dry crust you get off frozen pizza. Toppings are extremely thin and lacking. Prepare to go mining through the mozzarella to assure yourself toppings were added.  Service wise, the server was attentive and went through the motions. We had better experience from the host and the busser. The bussers did an amazing job and provided a more memorable experience. Would I ever come here again or recommend it to someone else? No; no I wouldn't. This place is a pass. Find something else if you want a good meal.",

    "text": "Ok, this review is more of a complaint and more of a review on staff (one paticular staff member that is). Wife, son and I were on our way back from the strip and were going to meet our friends at this place for a drink and pizza at i guess would be considered the bar area (we saw people with food and drinks on their tables). Well, the waitress (short hair red-head gal behind the bar) just had the nastiest personality. When we arrived our friends were sitting at the bar and approached to give them a hug. At that time, our friends called my son over to give him a hug as he was getting ready to be stationed to a military base on the following day. My son (19 yrs old) went in and our friends were about to give him a hug when that aforementioned gal began to scream, \"are you 21?!\". I attempted to explain to her that he is merely here to allow our friends an opportunity to give him good wishes on his journey. Well this gal did not want to hear the explenation as she stated in an angry tone, \"well he can wait and say goodbye on the outside of the bar\". We all looked at her like are you serious right now? I tried telling this lady that wife and i are planning on staying, but our son is gonna say goodbye and head back to the room. She still did not want to hear it as she said, \"he can do it from behind thw line\" as she pointed outside of the bar area. We tried to ignore her and my son said his goodbye's and began to leave the area. Well, our friends were like, \"so you guy's going to sit and have some cocktails with us\"? We said , \"hell no\", sorry but we are going with our son back to the room. As we left the area i looked back at that nasty attitude of a lady and fake smiled at her while waving and telling her, \"you see, that wasn't so bad was it\"? He just wanted to say hi and bye. But her nastyness of a person tried to ruin it for him. I just think if it was that big of deal that a 19 yr old was entering an outdoor bar/restauraunt area that the hostess that we passed on our way in would of stopped us and informed us that he could not enter. But whatever lady behind the bar, your ugly attitude can't ruin our trip here but good try. Nonetheless, will not return to this place because would not want to be treated like this again.  This occurred on 10-21-2017 past 9 or 10 pm.",

    "text": "Food was excellent. Our server, Cris R, was on his game!!! We had a coupon for a free app so we got the cheese sticks and a small pizza for four of us to split. The Manger, Erica, came over after we waited for about 45 min and informed us that our pizza would be another 10min. We were not in a hurry so we didn't mind. When our bill arrived, we still got our app free and our pizza was 50% off. We did not ask or complain about the wait and we didn't actually mind. It is good to see a restaurant that took the initiative to take care of their customer. We will be back and recommend this restaurant to everyone.",

    "text": "We had a really disappointing experience at Giordano's. We had a larger group and were seated at a bar table with the bartender as our server who got our drinks and took our orders right away, but after forty-five minutes when our appetizers hadn't come out he didn't seem to notice until another fifteen minutes had gone by after that.  It wasn't until we'd been sitting there an hour and a half when he came back and noticed none of us had gotten our food. He seemed like he was busy at the bar, so we didn't blame him, but it wasn't until this point that he warned us about the pizzas taking a while and admitted that it looked like the kitchen lost the ticket.  After an hour and forty five minutes, we finally got a visit from the manager who seemed totally unphased. She barely apologized and reminded us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes each but didn't seem to care when we said it had actually been an hour and forty-five minutes. She then went and sat down at a table and chit-chatted with another employee rather than go run the restaurant. Another half hour after that, we finally got our food. When she brought our checks, she comped the meals for those of us that ordered entrees but still insisted that it was normal for the pizzas to take an hour even after we explained it had taken two. Eventually she  took the pizzas off the check but still made us pay for our drinks.   So, all in all, it took two hours to get our food (which was actually good) and the manager didn't seem to care enough to even follow through with the kitchen, let alone stand up and go do her job rather than hang out with another employee right in front of us as we all sat there waiting for our food. Truly terrible service that night.",

We literally wanted to plan another trip back just so we can eat pizza at Giordano's again haha. Last year while my wife and I were searching for a location near by we saw that they were going to open the Vegas location and we were pumped! This pizza taste exactly the way we remember. The place is beautiful. There are some tv's above the bar and the decor is beautiful. Aside from the pizza, our server Patrick Y was awesome! I was a server for many years so I'm picky about servers but Patrick was right on, we never had to ask for anything because he was already on it lol kinda like a mind reader. Thanks Giordano's and thanks Patrick for making our Vegas experience that much memorable!",

This place advertises its traditional Chicago deep dish pizza, but they also have thin crust, pastas, and various  appetizers available. While I enjoyed the actual pizza itself, I was not a big fan of the crust. The crust came out really flaky (almost like a dry pie crust, in my opinion ) so I didn't care too much about that, otherwise definitely try it! There is inside and and outside seating available",

If it was worth the wait, fine, but the food was terrible and on top of it the waiter didn't even seem phased by the fact it took so long. Worst thing is my pizza was thin crust and vegan ( so no cheese) and my hubby just ordered spaghetti with tomatoes sauce. No deep dish or anything that warranted a 1.5 hour wait.

Although I did not experience the best service on my first visit, I gave them another chance and everything was great!

It takes time for a pizza that thick to cook all the way through.  I would also recommend eating in the upstairs section as the downstairs is a bar area and they bring the pizzas down the elevator where they might have a chance to cool off or be exposed to yucky stuff.   Giordanos is an AWESOME addition to Vegas!  I will be back for sure!",

It would be 45 minutes similar to going into the dining room so they didn't even have any started. Obviously that didn't work for my lunch break.   Update: emailed as instructed below six weeks ago.

Not to mention my wings were cold and just overall lacked luster. At least the waitress was very nice and attentive but that was probably the best part",

So what type of food were we missing!? CHICAGO DEEP DISH OF COURSE!  To explain, my boyfriend has only had mail delivery Lou Malnati's as far as deep dish goes and he had a hankering for it in Vegas. With seemingly no other sit down pizza places within walking distance of our hotel on the Strip, I decided to stop being a snot who only eats deep dish in Chicago and went for Giordanos. To my delight, it tasted much like it does in Chicago.   The restaurant itself was pretty cool. It was on this mini strip off the strip, with a bar area in a glass enclosure. We took a seat at the bar, ordered a cold local beer and waited the 45 minutes (it just takes that long to cook) for our deep dish pizza. For an appetizer we decided to get the fried calamari and peppers and it was salty, crispy, and very tasty. For our pizza we went for their version of meat lovers with of course, a side of Giardinera pickled vegetables, and ate until we couldn't eat anymore.   Is anything more satisfying than being pizza drunk?  As if the night couldn't get any better, we were able to walk across the street right as the Fountains at the Bellagio were dancing with some sweet jams to complete our evening.   Gotta love Vegas.",

We were given the disclaimer at the very beginning that if we were ordering food, we were going to be waiting a little bit longer due to the separate location of Giordanos that we were sitting at that was away from the kitchen. However, that was totally fine because the drinks were great and the bar tender was incredibly friendly and funny and talking with us as my guest and I were hanging out at the bar. When our amazing stuffed pizza came out, it was well worth the wait. The pizza was so good and we demolished it so quickly as a late night snack. I love the fact that they have the slight outdoor atmosphere of seating choices for the restaurant that located away from the hussle and bussle of the busy restaurant.",

We were not impressed by the pizza there, so we figured to give Giordano's another try here in Vegas but with the non pizza items.   We ordered the lasagna, chicken parmigiana, a cup of minestrone, and a side Cesar salad. We were again, not impressed.  Perhaps the tastiest thing was the minestrone, but every thing else was mediocre. Nothing to sing about or even talk about once we return home. The lasagna was no different than a Stouffer's frozen lasagna I can heat at home. The spaghetti that came with the chicken parmigiana was stuck together (obviously over cooked). 2 stars given because of the atmosphere. The restaurant is a nice setting.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice.... you can't fool me again Giordano's!!",

Before I remember the bottom being crispy, but the crust a bit doughy. Now it's just hard cracker bottom and the cheese seems super separated from the crust. It was weird. Whatever. We still ate it.

He took it well when we teased him about it taking so long later on when we ordered another drink. When the pizza came he asked if we would like him to serve the first slice.

We will be writing an official letter to headquarters!   I visited with my son, cousin, and family friend. When my cousins pizza came out it was accidentally dropped on him by another waiter. My cousin was burned by the pizza, his new clothes stained by the pizza, and the waiter used his hands to unfold the pizza as if my cousin could still eat it. Our original waitress came out and took the pizza away and put in another order. The manager and our asking if my cousin was ok and apologized but never offered to compensate his meal.   My cousin had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a replacement pizza, while we were all finished with our food. When the bill comes the waitress says we are going to give you 50% off the pizza. Really? For burning me, ruining my clothes, and waisting my time I get 50% off. Oh no no no no! Our family friend spoke up and said he needs to not pay anything considering this inconvenience. We weren't looking for free meals, but my cousin definitely shouldn't have paid anything.  The waitress had to check with the manager to get approval for a free pizza. His final decision was to only remove the pizza charge, but they still charged for my cousins lemonade and calamari appetizer. I will not be returning to this location based off of this experience. I've visited Giordanos in Chicago and wanted my family to have the experience of good food that I had there. It's a shame that a bad call was made to influence our decision to not return.",

Then was told immediately their pizza takes 45 min 2 cook! How is this good customer svc?! A bunch of losers who dont care work here . I guess I should of expected as much being on the strip. Next time I will take my $ to small businesses who appreciate my patronage & not waste my precious time on overpriced, underprepared establishments such as this.

    "text": "It was a huge disappointment for the overall experience. We came to Giordano's expecting real Chicago pizza, however, overall experience made me think that they had too much staff on the floor but there was barely no service offered.  We expected a long wait, but it was just a brief 15 minute wait. I definitely thought they were going to take our order ahead of time to be able to start working on the pizza instead of having us wait another 30 mins for the food at the table. We were not in a rush, but 30 minutes is enough time for someone to lose their appetite. Considering that the style of pizza they serve takes a long time, they should take the Chicago order style into consideration as well.  As we were sat at the table, our server was just too much. He just stared at us instead of greeting us or anything. He never introduced himself, but he did asked if we wanted to order, we asked for water and we ordered our food as well. We never got our water until our salad came out, and asked for them again.   The salad came out roughly in about 10 mins after we ordered, and it actually tasted pretty good. We got their house salad, yet I wish they offered a choice of more cheese or not, but it did not matter that much. Then, our pizza came out. We got the giordano classic for 2-3 people. I would say it is enough food for even 4 small girls to share, but that's just me. The server offered us to serve the first slice for us, which is the reason I am giving 1 extra star. Then we were on our own. The pizza was just bad. It seemed like they put the amount of marinara that should go in a thin crust. It was like they forgot to put the other scoop of sauce. That was how bland the taste was. It was like eating an onion pizza with so much cheese that had no taste to it. We basically only had one slice each, and left the whole thing behind us.  Will we come back? NO. I already even told my friends to go to local deep dish pizza places instead of coming out and waiting for a table, bad food and bad service. It was a combination of bad bad bad all the way.",

The pan pizza is authentic and delicious ( we opted for spinach and chicken sausage) and the thin hand stretched as good as any in the Windy City. The service was excellent thanks to Dominick, our server, who was on the mark for the entire meal. Knowledgeable, efficient, but never overbearing. We will definitely return here when we have a \"Chicago\" craving. And they also have frozen pizzas to take home! This place rocks!!",

After 30 mins finally was able to flag down waitress and ask where my beef sandwich was.  She ran away and it finally came in a few mins. 10 mins later pizza shows up, the kid announces it's a chicken sausage pizza. (Which on the menu is a specialty item).  I didn't order chicken sausage, I ordered Italian sausage.  Waitress lies to me and tells me they only make chicken sausage, and that Italian sausage isn't available. No Italian sausage available at a Giordano's pizza?????? I ask for manager, 10 minutes later he strolls by and starts to argue that I ordered Chicken sausage pizza. Well being a local and also from Chicago, I never heard of Chicken sausage before. So after arguing, waitress offered to cook new pizza ( another 45 mins) which I declined. I asked manager for his card, so I could write upper management about this disaster zone mismanaged restaurant.  I could offer some advice, like when you have new people always have a manager come around to the table to confirm the order, so it doesn't take 1.5 hours to correct a new employee problem. Oh and the manager coming with his card, never came back and we decided to just leave after waiting for him for 15 minutes. My advice to you is stay clear of this place for a year or two until they square away their problems and procedures.  Dinner time wasted. Shame, because I wanted an nice Italian style deep dish sausage pizza, so we went over to Rosati's on DI and picked one up. What a great pizza that is!  Buyer beware of this Giordanos location!",

The communication between the hostess and the servers were zero because the hostess kept seating people. Thank God we ordered an appetizer. We were not seen for 25 minutes, sitting with dirty appetizer plates and no drinks. The guy next to us went to the bar himself to get a drink. The table next to us just sat there too. It was a mess. I understood that you have to wait 40 min for a deep dish pizza. The comical part was when the server finally came back she dropped off our bill. I looked at her and said, \"we didn't even get our pizza yet.\"  I called the manager and he didn't even listen to our issue. All he said was, \"I will get your server.\" Anyway, the pizza was good but it took so long we didn't even get to enjoy it. We had one slice and took the rest to go. We don't have a fridge or microwave so our pizza is now no good. I should've gave it one star but it's the Holidays. U guys really need to get your act together. Side note Carlos our busser was good. We gave a big tip to him. Our food should've been comped or we should've been given a gift certificate. This was completely unacceptable. I even thought the server didn't put our pizza in. I would've yelled holy hades if she didn't. Anyway, not sure if it was her first time serving, but a tip for two people who were previous  servers. Ask for HELP! Tell your customers your slammed and you are sorry. Don't ignore your customers...we see you.",

The girl I originally spoke with was hanging back away from the counter, so I'd imagine that she never actually put it in.  I live about 20 mins from the strip, so it was a good two hours from the time I left the house to the time I returned with the pizza which was pretty disappointing.

This level is extremely noisy with \"garage door\" windows open to the noise of traffic along Flamingo Rd. Children in the contiguous booth kept kicking my seat back. The waiter, who was attentive throughout, said there would be a 45 minute wait for the thick crust and a 40 minute wait for the thin crust. We went for the latter because of time. When I asked to add garlic to the veggie pizza, he said he would have to then price the pizza as a \"build your own,\" so we declined. At any rate, we filled the long wait with some garlic parmesan fries that were very tasty.  The thin crust pizza is more like cracker crust, not chewy pizza dough, so I didn't care for it. The toppings were okay but bland (missed the garlic). Lots of free ice tea refills. When I tried to pay, the waiter returned saying my credit card had been \"declined,\" so I gave him a different one. Called the credit card company, which said there was no record of any attempt at payment. It said the restaurant had a faulty credit card reader; very annoying and upsetting. I looked at the \"declined\" receipt, which actually said \"invalid number.\" Should get its hardware functioning before embarrassing more customers. We left stressed out due to the noise, kicking, and payment snafu.",

    "text": "Ok- so I hate to do this- but I have to.  Came in tonight- a Saturday night.  It took 10 min for our server to come and take our drink orders.  We ordered a sangria, a Pepsi, and 2 waters.  I also noticed, tomato sauce on the table... gross.  I asked him if he could please clean it.  He said he would.  We ordered a spaghetti and meatballs and a spaghetti... also, 2 add on Caesar salads- should've been$3.00 more ... out comes the sangria, and the salads- the table is still dirty so I wipe it myself.  I see on the floor a used dental floss pick thingy-- double gross.  The entree comes out, no water or Pepsi.  I had to ask 2 people for waters.  Then the server come by 5 min later after someone already brought it- and said I have your water right here.  The bill comes out and we are over charged for the salads... spoke to the manager Adam... expressed our disappointment.  He apologized and said he would speak with the server... total disappointment... I understand it's a Saturday night and it's hella busy but watching other tables and servers being efficient- was irritating.  Our server just needs to get it together... tonight's dinner- fail.",
