Bagels are crusty on the outside and thick and chewy on the inside.  Standard selection of onion, poppy, salt, sesame, pumpernickel, etc.  Bialys too.    I had mine with cream cheese and sliced tomato, and they were perfect.    My kids had the omelette and bagelwich, both of which were generous.  Sandwiches later were good too.  Other baked goods were great, particularly the mini challah and the chocolate chip mandelbot.  Staff was friendly.  Will have to return.",

Yeah, I could have went to Einstein Bagels...and had some teenager slap something together for me. I didn't want that, I wanted a good bagel place, locally owned, and that knows how to make great bagels. I found what I was looking for at Harrie's Bagelmania.   Yes, it's in a \"sketchy\" part of town for some people. So what. Walk in, have a seat, and let them bring you a menu. Service was spot on...I had questions, I got answers without attitude. My food arrived fast. My check didn't arrive until I was just about finished. I like service like that which I consider just right.   But all that means nothing, what about the food? I had another one of those OMG did I order more than I can eat moments? That bagel was stacked! And it was kinda messy too (which is good and that's NOT a complaint!). And while I thought $1 extra for the capers was a bit pricey....they loaded my bagel up!  Decor wise the place could use a slight facelift, but to be honest I was too busy chowing down to give a dang about decor. They are a bit pricey for my typical lunch and way over the top on calorie counts but if you gotta have lox and bagels, Harrie's Bagelmania has what you need. I will be back!   (Bookmarked for months....boy am I glad I finally got over there to check it out. Oh and they take credit / debit cards...no ancient ATM in sight as mentioned by earlier reviewers, but I brought cash just in case.)  (Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #2)",

Though I still think NY bagels are the best, this wasn't off by too far.  We also got the fresh squeezed OJ and it was perfect! I love pulp and they had a good about of pulp in each sip!

I forgot my wallet once and offered to leave my phone as collateral while I drove home. The cashier was so sweet. She told me she couldn't let me drive without a phone for emergencies.

After I ordered, people kept trickling in until the place was nearly half full.  It's in a not so great part of town, and it only takes cash, but these are not reasons to skip Harrie's.  They have a large menu with all of your east coast deli favorites, made on the premises.  I had the Hoppel Poppel, which, and there is no other way to put this, is an enormous amount of food.  It's home fries with eggs, peppers, onions and salami into a glorious scramble that easily covers the whole plate and could probably cover another one.  It comes with your choice of bagel.  I got an everything bagel toasted, and it comes with a lot of cream cheese.  I didn't finish either my scramble or the cream cheese.  The Hoppel Poppel is good, but when you put some Cholula on it, it becomes great.  The potatoes I don't think were seasoned, but the peppers and salami add a lot.  Also, the salami is fantastic, not greasy at all.  I guess if I have a criticism of this dish, it's the lack of seasoning.  But, adding hot sauce really worked.  I got the wife corned beef with eggs to go.  Her potatoes were not seasoned, but they were cooked well.  Not surprisingly, the order of eggs with corned beef was massive.  Yet another breakfast we couldn't finish.    Service was fantastic, the check was brought out quickly as was my to go order.  Friendly people and a comfortable atmosphere.  Can't wait to return to get a huge sandwich for lunch.",

It's on Twain, the road that runs between Wynn/Encore and Venetian/Palazzo, and it's not too far from them, maybe about a mile to the east.   Just yesterday, I had two of the most delicious everything bagels, toasted, covered on top with crispy onions. And I had them with jalapeno cream cheese. There was so much yummy cream cheese, dripping out all sides, that I had to finish the cream cheese up off the plate using a fork.  And for this prices were very reasonable, about $3.25 per bagel with cream cheese.  The menu is quite reminiscent of a NY Jewish deli. In the past I've had pastrami sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, tuna fish on bagel, corned beef sandwiches, potato salad, cheesecake. All delish. And you can take deli meats home by the pound or bagels home by the dozen. The current Tuesday special is, I believe, a dozen bagels to-go for about $6.50.  This is semi-old-school Vegas. It's been in place since 1992 when the original & former owner Mort moved it here from a ritzy suburb of Chicago.   Open at 6:30am and closed by 3pm most days. Authentic, incredibly delicious and very fair prices. If you are anywhere near, try it out!",

    "text": "Much like the Bagel Cafe on the west side of town, Harrie's serves bagels and deli classics in an old-school diner-style setting. Portions are generous and good-quality product results in surprisingly high prices: my bagel sandwich with lox set me back an absurd $15. I will say that it was loaded with a lot of lox, but maybe normal portions and prices would be more appealing... Other than that, the bagel itself was underwhelming, toasted to a hardness that was difficult to bite into, and just wasn't particularly flavorful aside from the toppings.  Bagels are available in individually or in bulk, toasted or not, with or without schmear and other toppings. Shop only offers choices of regular or scallion cream cheese. Potato pancakes, knishes, blintezes, and other Jewish deli staples available as well as meats by the pound. I still prefer BC, but this isn't a bad option if you're on this side of town.",

I have now been there three times since and will never go again. Three straight times around 11:30 am they are either out have limited selection available of bagels. This would never have happened under previous ownership. As a New Yorker this was the one place that I could get a bagel similar to the Deli's on Long Island. The one breakfast sandwich I had the bagel was stale. A real shame.",

It was like the waitress had no idea where she was or what was happening. The only other time I have seen someone so out of it was when they were high.

    "text": "I wanted to love Harrie's Bagelmania. I didn't! There is a scarcity of New York style bagel shops in Las Vegas. The only three that I know of are Bagel Cafe (Summerlin), NY Bagels (downtown), and Harrie's Bagelmania.    Harrie's Bagelmania is in an economically challenged neighborhood. I was surprised to see the exorbitant prices that are disproportionate to the average income of the area and the highest prices that I have seen a bagel restaurant charge. Nearly $15 for a bagel with lox Sandwich!? Your kidding Me! Nearly $9 for a bagel with egg salad! This is before paying for a beverage.     I opted for the bagelwich with a fried egg and ham. This is one of the reasonable priced items on their menu. Interestingly the only style of egg listed was fried. What about scrambled?  I wasn't too crazy about the bagelwich. When I taste a bagel, my expectation is that it is hot and soft. This bagelwich fell short of my expectation. The ham was okay. As far as the coffee it was also okay.     I was satisfied with the service. The waitress was on top of my coffee refills at the same that she was pleasant. When I paid the cashier joked over the  change being an unlucky number. I easily rectified that when I left the waitress a tip for good service.     I don't love Harrie's Bagelmania. To be honest I left disappointed with the exorbitant pricing and bagelwich that fell short of my expectations yet satisfied with the service. My Harrie's Bagelmania check-ins stop here.",

Everyone always requests this place and we order the simplest thing:  -Bagel Breakfast Sandwich: egg, cheese (some sort of meat: bacon, sausage or ham) on a plain bagel.  That is it!  The eggs is cooked perfectly: like a fried egg and the yolk is just barely runny so all the flavors of the egg, cheese, meat and bagel dance on your tongue.  YUM!  Believe this: this sandwich is even good COLD!  We had lots of leftovers and people were eating them for lunch cold.  Cold egg?  Uh yeah, its good on this sandwich.  (I would NEVER eat a Egg McMuffin cold, but this shiz is for real!)  Their bagels are exactly what I look for in a bagel: moist, a little chewy and delicious flavor.  I have only had the plain bagel and if its that good, I can only imagine how good everything else is.  (after i ate two halves: one for breakfast and one for lunch, I gained 2 pounds, but I think it was worth it!!)  Nancy (who I think is married to the owner??) is a doll and always makes sure everything is perfect.  We ordered from here last week: 30 bagel sandwiches and a fruit bowl.  They cut the bagel sandwiches in half and I swear everyone ate at least 3 halves!  The total was around $193 (included tax and delivery) and she took a check.  Now this is hearsay, but a lot of the people in my office have come here for breakfast and have said how they INHALED all of their food, because its that good!  If anything, go here for a bagel breakfast sandwich or bagel and cream cheese and you will be addicted!",

However, they have an ATM machine from the 80s. It is the weirdest thing. It doesn't give you cash. It gives you a receipt, and then you give the receipt to the server who brings you your money.   The bagels are a little small but wonderfully and perfectly chewy. On this past visit, I went with a bagelwhich on an everything bagel. I decided not to get it toasted because everything bagels sometimes turn bitter if they're over toasted. It was a strong call, as the bagel was perfect untoasted. I actually went with ham, and the ham was a nice, thick country ham like I grew up on in Georgia. (Well, maybe it had a little less salt.) For $3.95 (which my friend had to pay for because I was without cash!), it is a solid breakfast.  I haven't tried lunch here, but I would say the breakfast is pretty standard fare. You don't go to Harrie's for trendy morning bites. You go here for breakfast with some Vegas oldtimers. Don't forget your cash.",

I'm used to having chicken noodle matzoball soup, so this was a change. For the price, avoid ordering it plus something else.  The turkey club sandwich was tasty. I ordered it with toasted wheat bread. The sandwich came out so large that I was almost not able to fit my big mouth around it.

A customer asked for something in a certain way,  She refused and said NOPE and rather to throw people out of her store.  The request was a very simple  to have the sable in a bagel,  She said NO  we do not place sable in a bagel  it is always served on the side  period.  It was a take out order to go to the airport!    The cooks was willing to do what customer wanted but the owner said NO  we do not do that, she does not even care about if a customer is happy or not!    a True GROUCHY old Lady!    If you want a very pleasant service and SMILING faces,  go to the Bagel Cafe off Buffalo ave.  MUCH MUCH better service and people are smiling!

I thought the bagels were about as good as grocery store bagels i.e. doughy and bland. I was hoping for real deli food like good pickles and potato salad but the potato salad was worse than the bagel. My travel companions were equally disappointed. I ordered lox cream cheese on a sesame bagel and if I had not been so hungry, may have given it away.   Also, the woman behind the counter left our bagels sitting on the counter while she helped several other people who were ordering. By the time they shouted our order, my brother was done with his bagel and mine was cold.   I also don't favor places that use styrofoam and to go packaging even when you're eating there. I would not go here again despite my desire to support mom and pops over chain restaurants.",

Harrie's Bagelmania is so much more than just a bagel shop. Absolutely everything is hand made from scratch and you can taste the love. Their sausage, egg, and cheese bagelwich blows all other breakfast sandwiches out of the water. The matzo ball soup tastes like your Jewish friend's grandma made it especially for you on a chilly day. The chicken salad is more flavorful than any I've ever tried; it was delicious (and I don't even like chicken salad, I only got to try this one because my friend ordered it). And the biali...OH the biali! For those of you unfamiliar with a biali (like I was), it is a type of bread -- similar to a bagel but not as dense-- with tiny minced onions and other delicious flavorings in the center. I've eaten their biali with the chicken salad, with the matzo ball soup, with cream cheese, and by itself...all amazing. I'd go to this place every single day if it weren't for the fact that doing so would turn me in to Shamu. I highly recommend it.  Note: They are cash only.",

    "text": "In another life, I was probably born Jewish. I went through a phase growing up when I was obsessed with bagels, lox, etc. Hell, I even studied the violin for 13+ years. Harrie's helped reunite me with my long lost (and imagined) Jewish identity while i did my stint out in LV.  Harrie's, as others have said, is a tradition in LV. For me, it was a Saturday morning late breakfast with either their hash or 2 eggs sunny side up all served with a warm toasted bagel of your choice and some cream cheese on the side. The coffee wasn't the best, but who cared? I was sitting here for a chance glimpse of the Elvis impersonator driving up in his silver Chrysler Sebring. It's more about the ambience here. This is old Las Vegas, folks. Good hearty NY style deli food with cheery people who love the city and treat the customers right.  Yes, they make their own bagels. When you go towards the back, you'll see the bags of flour and the mixing machines through the kitchen doorway. And they make a killer bialy too. The prices are good too. There's a breakfast special on the weekdays - can't recall how much, but it won't run you more than $5 for 2 eggs any style, some meat, a bagel and a coffee. Why sit in a generic Denny's or Blueberry Hill restaurant when you can just relax and feel at home here at Harrie's?  5 stars for ambience and service, 3.5 - 4 stars for food. I like the bialy the best. Reconnect with your love for bagels...and give Harrie's a try. If you see Elvis, take a picture for me. Thank you, thank you very much.",

I called ahead to reserve a 1/2 dozen and spoke to a cheerful, friendly employee who took my order. When I arrived I was greeted cheerfully and looked over some of the other goodies. I picked up some chopped chicken liver, 2 stuffed Knish and a nut filled Hamantaschen cookie. The bialy has a center of cooked onions and poppyseeds and was delicious. Crunchy outside and moist inside. The liver and cookie were also very tasty. I look forward to trying the knish. Super friendly staff and delicious food!",

That said, their bagels are quite good and, outside of the northeast, among the better bagels I've found elsewhere.  During our few visits here throughout our stay in Las Vegas, we got sesame, apple cinnamon, and egg bagels here, with the apple cinnamon being the worst of those by far.    The women who wait on customers were, without exception, friendly and attentive and efficient.  The man who did that for some customers was an obnoxious loudmouth who just would not shut up.  At one point, the two of us and one other customer were the only patrons in the restaurant, and the male employee (owner possibly?) was so relentlessly loud with that other customer that we could not hear our own conversation . . . and we were seated 2/3 of the way across the restaurant from him.  Amazingly annoying!",

    "text": "When my boyfriend suggested bagels (and Einstein's) I immediately thought of this bagel place I've seen numerous times driving down Twain. It's one of the only businesses left in this shopping center but it was packed on the Saturday morning we visited. You can seat yourself if you're dining in or order at the counter for takeout. My boyfriend got the bagelwich with a side of potatoes and I got the Burton's 1-2-3-1. We got our food quickly. The portions were huge, especially the side of potatoes. I was a bit confused by dish. The menu said it came with either a plain or onion bialy, but the waitress asked what kind of bagel I wanted so I got an everything bagel. She also asked if I wanted to sub the Swiss for cream cheese (yes sure). The real sadness was that I only got two slices of lox when the \"3\" in the name is supposed to be 3 slices of lox. I wouldn't care but when I know my dish is almost 3x that of my boyfriends because of the lox alone it was a little disappointing. Also, the \"thin\" onion slice was not that thin. Overall the meal was enjoyable though. Next time I'll probably opt for some of their cheaper options. It feels like a friendly neighborhood deli and most of the patrons looked like regulars. Definitely giving this another try next time I'm in the mood for a bagel.",

It really was an old-timers place, the kind where people have been going there for years and the waitresses know your names.  I was probably the only person in the place under 40.  I liked the feel, and the food was decent, I had the corned beef hash.  I've had better, but on the whole the meal was perfectly acceptable.  However what got me was the bill, $19 with tip for corned beef hash with a potato pancake and a cup of iced tea.  For that price I could've gone to the Stage or Carnegie Deli on the strip and gotten what would probably have been better food.  Will I come back here, probably, since I get that food craving every now and then.  And be forewarned, bring cash, they don't accept credit cards.",

I had the specials, which consisted of bagel, sausage, and three eggs.  I took two of my pals who happened to be celebrating homecoming as well.  We spent $24 on coffee and the specials.  All was served efficiently.  Same rude service, but mind you this place was packed early in the morning.  So head to that 'ol strip mall on Twain and Swenson in the 'hood, and grab yourself a special (if you read the RJ, don't clip the coupon.  It's an advertisement) and a toasted onion bagel.",

Everybody at the table loved it.  That is unusual to get 10 folks to sign off on a place. The service is always appropriate.

    "text": "I went here after reading all the Yelp reviews.  I don't understand all the rave reviews.  Nothing special AT ALL.  I ordered a pastrami omelet.  (Don't let that fool you... they do not have a giant selection of omelets, although you could specify ingredients to create a custom dish.)   When the plate arrived, I looked down to see a rather large portioned omelet that was stiff, fairly hard, smooth sided, compacted and in the shape of a triangle.  I immediately compared it to the looks of a tan colored cranberry scone.  There was no evidence of a yellow or egg whites.  It was all overcooked and brown.  If it wasn't for the triangular shape i'd say it looked like it was baked too long in a shoe.  yes, the texture while eating it was exactly as it looked.  Rubbery and flakey. Brown.  The omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes.  The bagel:  Nothing special AT ALL.  It's not like you are going to Einstein's bagels or anywhere of that caliber.  It was not extra tasty or extra large.  I was surprised at that for a bagel shop!!  I usually love hash browns or other types of breakfast potatoes.  Not this time.  These diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way.  Like warmed mashed potatoes that were cubed, and that stick to the roof of my mouth like peanut butter, but not as bad as peanut butter.  it was just weird. I'm sure that this was the first time in 30 years that I did not finish my breakfast potatoes.  It was only after I got my bill that I found out that the cheese that my waitress suggested (\"what kind of cheese do you want on your omelet?) that I found it that the cheese was $1.50.  I wouldn't have ordered the cheese at all if I had known it was extra.  Here is what breakfast cost me (for myself):  Pastrami omelet:  $10.99, cheese: $1.50, Milk, 20 oz:  $2.75.  With tax my total bill was $16.48 not counting a tip.  If the pastrami omelet was not the most expensive item on the menu, it was right up there.  So yes, you could very easily get your entree $3 cheaper.  I would not recommend this place, because although it was unusual to have an pastrami omelet, it, and the rest of the meal, did not taste special at all.  I wish I had explored elsewhere.",

At first I thought she was aloof, but when I asked for a bagel sliced, she told me that they charge for that and was I sure because even she thought that seemed unnecessary. I appreciated that. They are always kurt but helpful. And the salt bagel and bialy are the best. They even have the best cream cheese. If you can't tell the difference, you may be satisfied with other places. But if you are a True bagel snob, this is the place! Cash only though!",

When we walked in (around 11am) it was pretty busy. There were only a few open tables, and we were promptly seated. We ordered the whitefish salad appetizer and it was GREAT. I haven't had smoked whitefish salad like this since I lived in Chicago. Served with a bagel or your choice, and dill pickles, it was all very tasty! Paired with a Dr. Brown's Black Cherry soda, how could you go wrong?!?!?!?!   Next came the Lox, Eggs, and Onions, served with Home Fries. Just like grandma used to make (jk). The servings are a good size and the atmosphere is very casual. The bagels are the best bagels I've found in Las Vegas. My friend ordered some Rugala to go to snack on in his hotel room later on. We had to break into it just to have a taste and they were very good.   They have all kinds of meats, cheeses, salads, and desserts available for quick carry out. If you're looking for a great Authentic Jewish Deli in Las Vegas, this is the place to go. They are open 7 days a week, but only until 3pm.",

We have been going to Harries Bagelmania for many years and always came  back to Californian with several dozen bialys.  This is a type of an onion roll that's dipped in the center and onions are placed there along with a few on top.  Growing up In NYC this was a staple.  These are so hard to find unless you go back east.  I have searched the internet and found on place anywhere near me that has this on their menu.  Anyway, this is the one thing I like to bring back for me, friends and family.  So sorry Harry is no longer with us and I am sure he is missed.  The new owner which we met yesterday is a lot like Harry.  Warm, friendly and running a great place.  The waiters are helpful, accommodating and friendly.  Now for the food, Best salami and eggs you could find.  For us lite eaters a bagel, egg and bacon/sausage/ham is perfect as is the price.  Cream cheese and Lox.  Yummy.  Chicken soup, corned beef, pastrami.  I mean, what else could you want from a neighborhood deli and bakery.  STOP, EAT, ENJOY",

What a let down, are food didn't come out all together and people who sat after us and ordered after us got their food. It took 3 times for us to get our food.  Ok my family can go elsewhere I was still ok with this place. I was so excited to eat here today, we had a work lunch so we placed an order (we had 8 orders). I told my family because I was jazzed up for a bagelwich. I got my order today and it was wrong. What a let down today!!!!  Serious my order was easy. I guess I will no longer eat at this place.",

It tasted like someone has poured salt in the bagel on purpose. It was absolutely horrible. Not to mention  we spent $15 for a lox bagel. $30 wasted. Don't get it. Worst part is that we are headed back to Los Angeles and we're unable to return this sad excuse of a bagel. So annoyed",

The negatives, they charge $2 for a slice of cheese and the sandwich is pretty small. I usually try the Matzo Ball Soup too but this time I ordered Mish Mash (Matzo Ball Noodles and Kreplach  )  to go and will have it for dinner. On Tuesdays they sell Bagels $6.50 a dozen which I was told they make their own and Corned Beef and Pastrami at $12.50 a pound. I need to come by on a Tuesday and stock up. It's on the east side of town so they close at 3PM. Take the time and GO",

    "text": "It's in a real crappy part of town. Prostitutes and Drug dealers galore, only thing that breaks the scenery is stepping over the homeless! So, the location may not be something that Harrie's can control, but their service IS. My husband, visited the store earlier this morning to get our family breakfast. I am newly pregnant and was craving a lox and cream cheese bagel with the traditional tomato and lettuce. He arrives home with a lox cream cheese SPREAD (not even a slice of lox... they say they are like a real NY Bagel Place, having been to NY several times, and having loved ones their, I KNOW that the spread is the kiss of failure in a bagel) then they put lettuce and a hunkin huge slice of red onion.. WHO DOES THAT? Like that is how anyone would order an effin bagel.. SO, when he got home, of course I was upset that my sandwich was incorrectly made. Asked my husband for the receipt, he said that they didn't give him a receipt.. no surprise. I took the sandwich in.   I was met at the counter by an extremely overweight lady ( who couldn't even stand, she had to lean on the counter the whole time or sit) who asked if she could held, I said, \"My husband was just here and ordered this and other stuff, and my sandwich is wrong. It had this huge slice of onion on it and I wanted it with tomato.\" I opened the sandwich from it's foil wrapper to show her. She push the bagel back to me and said \"Well, that's how he ordered it.\" I refuted telling her that he knows how I like my bagel and he would have NEVER asked for the fresh onion. She and I went back and forth for a second, she grabbed my bagel sandwich, while it was opened with her dirty hand and slammed it down on the cooks line and said \"scrape the onion off and put tomato on it.\" I said \"No, I want a new sandwich all together (because she put her dirty hands all over the bare food) or I wanted a refund\" She grabbed the sandwich threw it in the trash an then she yelled  \"Get the hell out of my store!\" I told her that I wouldn't leave without a refund or a new sandwich.  You have to understand that in Vegas people in this neighborhood must always be on the run, so she thought by next saying to me \"Leave or I will call Metro would scare me and  I would run out the door leaving her as a victor (with no refund and my sandwich)... but I responded with \"Call Metro, as far as I see it you are stealing my sandwich and money! I Don't have merchandise that I asked for and you aren't giving me the sandwich out of the trash... so either refund me or give me a new sandwich, If you refuse I will stop payment on the card that I used.\" \"I will call and have you arrested!\" She said. I responded with \"Oh I will pay you what I owe you, but I will not be charged for something that you won't fix or refund me on. I don't allow ANYONE to BULLY ME! That ended on the playground.. and as a adult, it is NOT OK to be bullied out of your rights! \"She grabbed her calculator and started to try to figure out what she would have to refund and it seemed as if it was either (or both) that it hurt her to figure it out because it was too hard, or she realized that she would be losing cash in hand and all she had to do was fix my order (I mean how many bagels gets thrown away in a day anyway just fix the sandwich)   She finally understood that I wasn't leaving and that she either had to make my food over or refund me the money.  She kept telling me to go sit down and she would deal with me later and wanted to help the regular (Jewish) customers. I stepped back, then she says to her customer loud enough for the regulars sitting there and eating  \"Yeah, she is mashuga!\" Having been deeply offended that she would pull that sort of card on me, not a cool thing to do as a business to start slinging religious terms to cut down on another person in a way to show that I am an outsider, not being part of their religion. I knew in a second what she was pulling and I wasn't going to allow this. I dated a Jewish man from Brooklyn. I understood what she was pulling! I tell her, \"What you don't think I know Jewish? I know what you just called me!\"  Finally, after a bunch more words that represent nothing more than poor customer service and bullying by her, she succumbed to my request and fixed my sandwich. The food, when I finally ate it wasn't that good. The onion on the bagel was so burnt that I couldn't taste the flavor of the bagel itself and the lox spread was kinda gross.... the produce was fresh at least... I just think that it wouldn't matter if the food was absolutely wonderful, I wouldn't patron a place that is all smiles to you until there is an issue and rather than helping you they spit in your face and tell you to get out or they will call the police. I wasn't loud, beligerant or rude. I got there towards the end though. I asked nicely and got the door anyway.  You decide for yourself, but, I say. \"Spend your $$ at a place that respect you!\"",

My only complaint is that half of our food came out 20 minutes before the other half of us got our food. Overall this is an excellent place for bagels and breakfast.",

It's known for its Friendly service and REAL food. FRESH made bagels and More. It's a little cramped in there with NO boothes and most patrons are regular who are WELL-FED! lol  They know your name and what you are gonna order before you get seated. Along the back wall is a mural of an old school neighborhood with people looking out their 3rd story window of their brownstone hollering the ice cream man-etc(you get the picture)  Well they have polaroid cut-out of REAL customer taped over the faces on the mural to personalize it-VERY COOL!!

I mentioned on another discussion board that I thought Weiss' Deli in Henderson had the best bagel Ilve had outside New York and I had a couple of people say they thought Harrie's was better. I've eaten at both places only once, but I think I like Weiss' bagels better. Harrie's is still a great place. Everything tastes freshly made. Service was excellent at Harrie's too.  The everything bagel I got was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just like it should be. I also appreciate that they make their own pastrami. It's cash only.",

This place is open only for breakfast and lunch, but I go for breakfast when I have a chance because it reminds me of the deli of my childhood, Shapiros of Indianapolis, when I go there then. Although it is not as great as it was when Harrie was alive [he died a few years ago], Harrie's widow lovingly keeps his restaurant and his deli alive. Go first thing in the morning and you will see a cross-section of the real Las Vegas -- politicians, cab drivers, general folks -- enjoying a good meal. It is worth it just to go for the \"show.\"  It has a real deli feel to it.  Something which is missing in other better known Las Vegas delis.",

    "text": "Sooooo disappointed...  Let me set up our story: I am a lover of NY knish...yep even the square ones you can find at a dog stand. And hubby is Jewish from SF. First generation American. Together we are a dangerous bagel seeking, knish seeking, lattke seeking pair of weirdos. I guess we expect the lattkes to be like his 90 year old grandmas and the knish to resemble something his Israeli family could whip up. Bagels? I guess we expect ones you can find in SF and NY.  This place has none of the above.  The service was bad from the get go and I ignored it because I was excited to find a place like this.  I immediately ordered a knish to start with and it came...huge...weird old dough and skin on chunky potatoes inside. It seemed microwaved. And I kept tasting it and trying to find hints of caramelized onion or leeks...nope...some onion powder at most.  Next I ordered a potato pancake (as they called it) and of course we expected a lattke. Nope. Seemed also microwaved and it looked like my old college day salmon patty I used to whip up and bake. Basically it was the texture of a ground veggie burger.   Ok. Now for the bagels. Hubby ordered egg whites and tomato on a garlic bagel. I ordered Nova and an everything bagel it came platter style with cream cheese, red onion and tomato. His bagel was hard and it had dried garlic flakes on it. My everything bagel (I requested non toasted) was also hard and seeds and flakes were burnt on the top.  We sat in silence and I ate my room temperature Nova and he ate half his sandwich. The server lady kept giving me the stink eye and I thought I was just imagining things but hubby said something when we went to the car lol.  So for the crappy coffee and stale food that we took mere bites of...we paid our $32 bill plus a tip at 9am and never looked back.  Honestly, I guess we just expected waaaaay more than day old tasting items.   *sadface*",

I would say that this is definitely a hole in the wall, it is not in the best part of town in Vegas but it is quite worth the trip for a good breakfast.   I had the apple cinnamon bagel with the cinnamon cream cheese and it was a great pair. The cream cheese wasn't too sweet either (as I've tried their strawberry cream cheese = MY FAVE before). I know that when I go to Einstein bagels or something, the cream cheese is extremely sweet. This place has it in moderation so you get the best of both worlds of a hint of sweet and the cream cheese flavor.   The bagel quality makes this place get 4 stars-- not 5 because of the horrible service we had.   The lady that took our order and served us was NOT enthusiastic at all.  When she handed our meals, she did not even repeat what we got, she literally just placed it on our table and walked away.   I was astounded at how someone could STILL work in a restaurant with that kind of attitude. Vegas is known for their hospitality and maybe that lady was having a bad day?   Who knows.   Regardless the quality of Harrie's bagels are a must-try.",

Atmosphere: Classic NYC deli feel. Its a big smaller than their competitors across town, but it has everything you would need. LOVE the drawings on the wall.   Food:   Bagel with Cream Cheese: 7/10 I LOVE their egg bagel. It is soft and chewy with a nice flavor profile. Their plain cream cheese tend to be on the bland side, so I would go with their flavored cream cheese. They have quite a few for you to choose from.    Bagelwich: 8/10 AMAZING! If you've never tried Muenster cheese in a bagel. DO IT. This place has really good Muenster cheese (much better than Bagel Cafe). The chef is also very accommodating. They can do egg white or regular egg. They will do no oil or light oil if you are trying to be health conscious.   Nova Lox Bagel: 8/10 You get veggies options with this. Cucumber/chives or tomatoe/lettuce. They gave a generous serving of the lox. I enjoyed this sandwich =)  Price: $$. My sandwhich run around $5-$7. Lox was around $15. Feels pretty standard. A little cheaper than Bagel Cafe.   Overall: Recommend! I didn't really care for their regular cream cheese. Other stuff was good! Will be back!",

I expected something creamy with a kick of jalepeno but other than the visible chucks of jalepeno and hint of the taste it was like any other spread. The bagels themselves though were the big let down because they didn't taste fresh but we're a bit chewy. I've had better store bought bagels that I toasted myself with plain cream cheese spread.",

Very old school neighborhood, and by that I mean I wouldn't dream of coming here after dark, which should tell you a lot since I am a seedy tenement dweller myself, but still..  Besides, it closes at 3 p.m. so you should make it out safely, even on the winter solstice.  The restaurant is in a pretty empty looking strip mall, which didn't seem nearly as vintage as the rest of the surroundings, and inside it's small but perfectly clean and cheerful.   It was afternoon so uncrowded when we arrived. Service was friendly, and I decided to try a couple of old deli stand-bys : bagel with a schmear and cabbage soup.  The bagel was big and toasty with a generous helping of cream cheese, and the bowl of soup was huge. The broth had that sweet/spicy/tangy combo flavors it should, along with big chunks of tender beef, which were unexpected and really served to make it a full meal.  The broth was a little thicker than I would have liked, but it was a ribsticker for sure.  My friend happily chowed on her triple decker monstrosity involving pastrami and corned beef, neither of which I consider fit for human consumption, so we'll have to take her word of approval on that. Yuck. Did intrigue me enough to consider going back another time for brisket or chicken salad, my other faves. Not inexpensive like you might hope in a little dive, but good quality.    One of these days I'm going to find a place that serves complimentary pickles and rye bread like the good old days and that fifth star will be on the table.",

We ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, and bacon on an everything bagel in addition to a blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese and took our order to-go. Service was quick and friendly (we were helped by the owner herself!) and our order didn't break the bank. The bagels were delicious! We've since returned and ate-in, enjoying another breakfast sandwich on a jalapeno bagel and an everything bagel with plain cream cheese. We're going back for a third time this morning.  I would argue that for a bagel place, there are limited bagel options, but the options are good. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Harrie's has been here for 25 years for a reason.",

I love an everything bagel, and what I love even more is when \"everything\" is on both sides of my bagel. I found that here. Problem is, their bagels are really hard. Really, really hard. My usual spread is onion & chive. I find their spreads here are really thin, if you were to hold the bagel to on the side, it would slide off. I tried the Lox spread and it was so incredibly salty, I ended up throwing it away. What I do love is the cookie case. I've tried them all, and they are all pretty damn good.   Also I think their prices are a little steep, $3.78 for a bagel & cream cheese (did I really just complain about prices for a Jewish deli)? Yes, I did.",

In the course of doing business in los angeles I was always in industrial or areas where business's had their warehouses in run down areas. I was pleasantly surprised with this eatery. Its a bit of a drive for me but runs about 1/2 the cost of bagel cafe. I had their 7.99 breakfast special. Onions and eggs sausage patty's (2) potatoes and a bagel. This is good old fashioned large portions and good food. quite a spread from the ripoff that is the strip,and basically a stones throw from there. Its near the convention center so for all you visitors its an awesome fillup on your way to long full day of work. For value they get two thumbs up! the service was also right on point. I will say it would be nice if they improved their coffee, a bit weak for my starbucks palate. otherwise a solid good value.",

The waiter was so nice and friendly, and the place was full when we got there, so that is always a good sign.   I had the brisket sandwich, it was ok, definitely lacked salt. It came ice cold, and I wondered if that was the Las Vegas way of eating it. The waiter assured me that it was not. My husband ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. The eggs were not cooked through and had some raw, runny spots. The waiter was apologetic and returned it to the \"chef\". He completely copped an attitude, and actually started complaining about us to the waiter and someone else behind the counter! Dude, we are sitting right here, and can hear you!  Anyway the hash was different than we are used to, but it was still good. Everything lacked salt, but I guess I'd rather have to add, than deal with too much. I would give it another try.",

I tried the jalapeno and cheese, sesame, everything, and poppyseed.  They were all very very good.  Just enough bite on the outside and chewiness on the inside.  What i was truly impressed with was that the lox spread had actual chunks of salmon in it.  Very, very yum.  I also had the vegetable and strawberry spread, and they were also very good.  Nancy mentioned that she adds no preservatives into her products.  I think that's all the more reason to give this place a try.  You won't regret it.",

Many locals stop by here for breakfast and lunch.  I was in the area recently.  I took the RTC city bus route 108 from McCarran Airport.  For $2, the bus will wisk you to Harrie's in 10 minutes.  It's in a little strip mall on the corner of Swenson and Twain.  Despite being a deli, they offer sitdown service.  One entree that I enjoyed was their Three Fer plate: knish, potato pancake and a blintz.  It comes with sour cream and apple sauce on the side.  On my recent trip, I had the kasha knish.  They also offer a knish with potatos or meat.       I would definitely return for breakfast and lunch.  The staff is friendly and food was fresh.  As their name implies, they have a host of bagel combinations.  They do close at 3pm.",

I ordered an everything bagel with lox cream cheese (cream cheese with smoked salmon in it).  YUM.  We were visiting Vegas so we also ordered a dozen bagels to-go with a pound of cream cheese for about $12.  Not bad considering it was supposed to be breakfast for the four of us for 3 mornings.

Lots of storefront parking and numerous tables inside.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the staff who were eager to assist me, though I confessed I needed a little time to look over the menu, which they handed to me. I was craving a breakfast bagel sandwich but for some reason had trouble seeing it on the paper menu. The owner (I assume) laid out the options for me on the wall menu and I realized it was categorized under \"Bagelwiches.\" Ordered a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Bagelwich and a Bialy with cream cheese to go. Though it was still early on a weekend morning with few patrons inside, they were fulfilling large delivery orders, but I waited no longer than 10 minutes to receive mine with a couple packets of hot sauce in the bag by request.  The Bagelwich was good (though it was on a Sesame bagel rather than the Everything bagel I ordered--not a big deal because it was still delicious), and the Bialy was huge! and filling.   The owner personally thanked me for coming in--I suppose it was obvious I was just visiting--which was a thoughtful gesture. When I'm in town again I'd likely to come back and dine in for breakfast.",

Whenever I've had any pastrami sandwich it has come with some sort of mustard. They handed me my order in a bag. In a to go box. I open the box to the dry sandwich, some fruit, and a pickel wrapped up.  As soon as I took my first bite. I knew I messed up ordering... They didn't place any mustard in the bag, utensils, or napkins. I was left with nothing but pastrami, rye bread, a pickel, and fruit.

    "text": "First & foremost, make sure you are a patient person. It looks like a New York deli & it feels like one; it even comes close to an almost identical taste too. The biggest challenge I had (& I wouldn't really call it a major problem) is the service part seems a little unorganized. You don't know whether to seat yourself or go to the front of the line. There isn't much staff so it's quite a long time for some basic menu items. Please take major note, the staff that is here, WORKS EXTREMELY HARD! What may seem to be the owner (who works behind the counter) is the only person that paid attention to me. The server that is running the floor not once asked me anything. Not even a 'is everything ok?' until I was just about to depart & he asked if I wanted some water (with a smile). I had to go ask for a glass of ice which again was quickly brought to me by the Owner/Manager.   Ok so aside from that, the food is FABULOUS!!! Egg Bagel with cream cheese. I wish they put the cream cheese on the bagel so it would have been slightly melted when I got it but that's ok because it was a very nice & tasty texture. The everything bagel with fried egg & bacon; cooked to perfection. Egg was perfect, bacon crispy, bagel; delish! Oh & nothing would be perfect without a Dr. Brown's Diet Black Cherry Soda. Yummmmmmmmmy!!  They were very nice & gave me a little taste of the chicken salad (my favorite thing for a lunch item other then deli meats that I will have to try next time). Unfortunately the consistency was more like a paste then an actual classic chicken salad. That's just a side note & not directly part of my review.   As I mentioned above, I WILL BE BACK! I need for my the deli meats on a bagel sandwich. I have to say I'm pleasantly happy leaving feeling like just for a little bit I was visiting New York.  Thank you for the delicious meal! Price point was really good & everything you do is with a smile! Cheers Bagelmania! See you soon.",

It was a very satisfying breakfast.  The second time I ordered the exact same thing, it was inconsistent from the first. Although The Omelette and bagel were again very good this time they put the cream cheese on the bagel (instead of on the side) and it was less cream cheese than i got the prior day. Also I found a piece of someone's rubber glove in my meal....parting gift?  I'd probably order again from here but I was hoping for more consistency.",

My husband and I Sharad a breakfast 3 eggs and hasbrowns. Came out Very fast and Very Yummy.  For Bagels we ordered a cinnamon raisin and blueberry bagel. They are very flavorful, fluffy they come in different sizes because the are made in house and hand made. They come with a scoop of cream cheese. I would recommend this if you looking something fast and yummy.  Two bagels and one breakfast meal with two coffees $21.72",

The egg & cheese bagel is quite good.  So are the fried potatoes.  This is clearly a place that locals patronize, so it does not feel ridiculously touristy like those on the Strip.  The prices are very reasonable too.  The coffee is nothing to write home about, and is unfortunately only served in large styrofoam cups.  Come for the bagels, not the coffee!",

It was sold to Siegel  more than 1 year ago. Owners Stephen and Judy Siegel, Michael crandel , Sean theuson their in house attorney. Same mo as pink box sued the previous owner. It doesn't cost them anything to sue only a few hundred dollars for court fees. They try to shake people down for money. A bunch of scam artist. Check the internet. They layer their llc's to hide the fact that they own business and properties. I read how they tried to overcharge a customer for cookies. Watch carefully the weight and prices that they ring up on the register. Be careful like  Frank r said the bagel is nothing like a New York Bagel  Very poor taste and quality",

Now, I never read newspaper tangiibly or online, but I happened to check it and see my request, 8 months later.  The truth is, as everyone can see here, I found kreplach soup in town back in May.  I had not been back to Harrie's since my first trip because whenever I think to go there, it is after their 3 PM closing time.  However, this weekend I felt miserable, and decided the only way to recuperate was to get kreplach soup.  Eric R. and I happened to have planned on lox and bagels for breakfast, so I decided to get a half dozen bagels there too.  I walked in, grabbed a bottled Dr. Brown's black cherry, and at the counter I declared with passion, \"Give me the largest container of kreplach soup you have!\"  The lady smiled and pointed to a big to go container, and I waved my hand and exclaimed, \"PERFECT!\"  Then I proceeded to order a half dozen bagels for Eric R. and a small cream cheese (he had the Tofutti one in the fridge but I think he really wanted the real deal so I surprised him).  In the end, I came home and had a giant bowl of kreplach soup accompanied by bagel chips, then some lox (aka brain food), whipped out some capers and sliced onion for Eric R., and saved the other half of the soup to get me through today.  A combination of Harrie's kreplach soup, Eric R.'s furnishing me with love and kleenex, and benadryl have nursed me back toward normalcy.",

Three eggs with your choice of bacon or sausage, potatoes, and bagel of your choice! The eggs are real, the bacon is thick and salty, the potatoes are freshly diced and scrambled to a nice crispness, and the bagels are made in house and a variety of around 15! It's in a old strip building a few blocks from The Strip and really only known by the locals. Over the 10 years I've been faithfully visiting Harries, it's a sketchy neighborhood with a couple of bookies sitting in the back! There's always a cop presence in the joint and if the bookies aren't entertaining enough, you'll occasionally see a crack head walk by the front! It all adds to the ambiance of a old Vegas deli joint that's stood the test of time and still has the characters visit that kinda framed what Vegas used to be in a time gone by! This southern gentleman will continue to visit in hopes to continue to see a Vegas of time gone by!",

It is just east of the strip in a semi questionable part of town, but anytime I go in its filled with older folks who eat brunch on Tuesdays while the rest of the town is hustling. Definitely takes me back East everytime I walk in.  Amazing food guys -  seriously good food, great portions, moderately priced for the quality. I will gladly pay for quality food that was obviously made with love.  Typical deli with bulk meats, they cook their own corned beef among other things. They have awesome hardy breakfast options as well as sandwiches and entres. They have a case full of salads and sides, the bagels are fresh daily (obviously) they even have the Italian cookies you pay by the pound (I believe), just like back east!  Take an hour and stop by here for breakfast or lunch, or pick up some damn good fresh bagels for your office, you will not regret it. And I'll bet you will be back!",

    "text": "Although locals may understandably grouse about paying close to $15 for a nova bagel, we Angelenos have been paying such tribute at the Langer's Deli altar for decades.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/langers-los-angeles-2#query:langers%20deli\">yelp.com/biz/langers-los...</a>  The comparison is apt, because Langer's is also in a part of town not hitherto known for its culinary excellence.  Also apt, because both places have the same sort of quaint Aunt Enid-like \"sit down and eat, Bubbeleh, you look skin and bones\" type of feel.  But where Langer's has lines down the block and has been designated a cultural heritage site, this place is still somewhat fledgling, although I did see a Bentley and a Maybach during my 20 minute stay on a weekday morning, so surely they aren't far from stardom.  The bagels here are legit, yo, and the nova salmon sublime.  So too, the Russian Tea cake cookies, which are melt-in-the mouth delicious.",

The real problem is the restaurant itself. It needs a complete remodel or they should relocate. If you're ODC like me, a visit to the restroom will ruin your appetite. There's one tiny dingy unisex restroom located not far from the kitchen with poor ventilation. The seating area of the restaurant is old, but well lit and clean. The back near the restroom has narrow hallways, is darker and feels dirty. I'll only go back if they renovate and clean it up. Overall the place is overrated.",

It's a Jewish inspired menu, and the bagels are easily the best I have had in Vegas.  Also, on Tuesdays, they sell a dozen bagels for dirt cheap...I think maybe $5?  This morning I had the breakfast special of 3 huge eggs, fried perfectly, a slab of ham, a mound of hash browns, and a sesame bagel.  We also got a potato pancake - I'm not a connoisseur of potato pancakes, but Harrie's are awesome.  Service is pretty good, but they always make sure your coffee or iced tea are filled.    Plan ahead, because Harrie's is cash only.",

While at the gym, \"Where can I get some lox and bagels?\". After the gym, \"Where can I get some lox and bagels?\".  Well, hello Harrie's Bagelmania. I have had you bookmarked for well over six months. Thank you cravings that would put a pregnant woman to shame. When I want a certain food, let no one get in my way.   The service is quick and efficient. As I walked through the door, the busperson already had ice water and menu in hand and was walking to my table. Two minutes later, the waitress took my order. 5-10 minutes and my Nova Lox and Everything Bagel was out. I had ordered the Fresh Fish Platter For One ($14.99). My unsalted salmon came with a scoop of either plain or chive cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and olives. The chive cream cheese uses fresh chopped greens. The everything bagel was chewy and possessed an amalgamation of all their savory components. On top of that, not only did I have enough of ingredients to dress two half bagels, but top the extra veggies with salmon. With each order, there was six strips of the fatty fish. I am thankful because recently I have become a garbage disposal.   The restaurant was half packed and the staff was able to finish my meal in half an hour. It is a great place for a quick breakfast.",

But bagels are their specialty, so I understand. The hollandaise was grainy. Another time they made me an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms it was delicious! Plus it came with a bagel and I got fruit instead of home fries, so great options. Yesterday I tried their beef barley soup and it was pretty tasty came with bagel chips. Very reasonable prices as well!! I'm so happy I found this place!",

Essentially you are going for the food and nothing else.   Service and prep are ABYSMAL. As my party puts it, \"there is an issue every time.\" The customer will principally deal with this middle-aged, portly blonde woman that works the counter who is weary of her surroundings, humorless, and completely devoid of personality. I have yet to be waited on by anyone else. It takes her forever to ring up an order, details need to be confirmed and re-confirmed to ensure she's understanding you, and sizes/portions may still be wrong. She is not proficient with the credit card swiper and seems borderline offended that anyone would even vaguely consider paying that way. Suggestions emerge as gentle nudges, pushing you into food specials that actually cost more to the customer thanks to their portioning. When you get your food, assuming you ordered a bagel, the cream cheese is slathered on so haphazardly that its spread is reminiscent of the Ocean Spray logo. You actually need to re-do the work of the line cook and spread it again.   Prices are disgusting. $10-15 after taxes for a bagel and lox (more expensive than NY, NY which is FAR better). $2.60 for a 10-12 oz beverage. Fountain drinks? Obligatory largest size. Good luck fitting it in your cupholder. Come on.",

    "text": "I went to Harries exactly four times since moving to Las Vegas. The fact that it is in a ghetto is scary, even in daylight, but the reward of a good bagel made me forget about the neighborhood. Each time I went there, I took advantage of the Tuesday special. The first time they only had three ET's (my favorite), so I had to add a few others to round out the dozen. I was told that you can get exactly the mix you want if you call on Monday. So I call on Monday and order 12 Whole Wheat ET bagels. They said that this was a special order and I would have to prepay it (cash). I was told I would still get the Tuesday special price. So my wife drives 30 minutes to prepay the special price and is informed that it is a special order and the Tueday price does not apply. She then drives 30 minutes back home. I drove on Tuesday to pick up the order and asked why I was required to pay the normal price, because 'special orders' are not included in the special price, that is their policy (even though their facebook page say ALL bagels are cheaper on Tuesday) . Okay, That is their policy. I am new in town and I must learn these things. The third time I ordered 9 Whole Wheat and 3 Bialys. The WW bagels were good and I added my own 'everything mix' to them. The bialys were rolls shaped like real bialys with a dab of onion in the center, nothing like Kossar's Bialys!  The fourth time I placed an order the owner took my order, name and phone number, as was usual. What was unusual is that they did not have the order ready when I got there, so I just told the clerk, \"just give me 12 Whole Wheat\". She opens the bag and is intercepted by the owner who says, \"No bagels for him\". The owner then tells me she has the right to refuse service to any undesirable customers. \"I refuse service to you. Goodbye\" I asked why and she said I insulted her help (which I would never do).  I left, never to return. If she wanted to refuse service to me, why did she take the order? She could have saved me an hour trip. She wanted to inconvenience me. She is a very mean woman who offered no evidence of my behavior except her word. Enjoy the bagel place in the ghetto.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this bagel place when I was back in Vegas doing maintenance. The bagels are the real deal, 4.5 star but not the best in town. Bagel cafe off of Buffalo is better for sure. So if you live on the westside or Summerlin you really don't need to bother coming to Harrie's besides to just check it out. The bagels have high gluten and a thick chewy crust, just like they are supposed to. Too crunchy though. If you leave them out for any bit of time in the desert air they become very hard very quickly. This place is an old school deli. It reminds me of a bagel deli I used to go in Fort Lauderdale when I lived in Florida.",

    "text": "If I'm on my way to, or from the sports book at LVH (yes I will still call it that lol) or heading to Chinatown from Henderson I pass this place often. I've had it bookmarked a while and decided to finally give this place a try. When I'm in the area I usually keep driving because you never know what you'll get in this. Located in the ever so famous crack alley this place isn't a place you think you would enjoy or have high hopes for outside of yelp just looking in from the outside, but enough about the lovely area this place is actually quite good if you look past the exterior. When a waffle place close by had no seats I looked into my bookmarks and saw harries was close so we stopped by on a Sunday around noon.   First impression the place is a bit dated and could use a makeover. The carpet was a bit grungy and the tables looked like the came from the 70's. I decided I was going to stay and let the food do the talking. I already knew I wanted lox and a bagel. Nova is the less salty version and there's a few options to choose from. I went with the burton 1-2-3, almost like the platter but with less nova. My handsome decided on the three fer. Which has a knish (your choice of meat or potato) a potato pancake, and a cheese blintz. The nova was fresh, not too salty. I had it on an onion bagel with cream cheese. I added capers as my plate didn't come with them. I thoroughly enjoyed my nova and bagel with schmear. The three fer plate was enough for just the two of us to share but we both shared both our plates. The knish was loaded with brisket and the postal pancake was crispy and savory. Our server was friendly and our food came out in good time. I also took home some rugelach. Yes I just googled the spelling. Little pastries with Apple and raspberry filling. They also have chocolate but chocolate is not my thing. I would come back here and try some more jewish staples. The challah French toast looks nommy as well as the kreplach. Unil next time Harries. Shalom!",

My mother even said she would go to this place just for their coffee.  After this morning, We will never set foot in this establishment again. I would have recommended it before to friends and family but not after this morning.  I ordered the 3 eggs with I thought the hash browns and a side of fruit. My mom ordered the BLT with a side of hash browns and extra mayo.  I received my eggs and a cup of fruit, when I asked where the hash browns were the waiter informed me that he substituted them with the fruit. I said I wanted the hash browns with a side of fruit. We told him we had no problem paying extra for the hash browns.   My mother went to eat her hash browns and they were so salty, you wanted to ask if the lid fell off when seasoning the hash browns. Her sandwich consisted of a slice of tomato, one piece of lettuce and about 6 slices of bacon. No mayo... there was a cup on my plate with what looked like mayo (turned out to be butter).   Then came the tipping point, after eating my eggs (still didn't have my hash browns) I found a light colored hair buried in my fruit cup, of which I only ate 3 grapes. We both lost our appetite. Asked the guy for our check. He brought it over. Okay I ate most of my food so yes I should be charged, my mom barely took a bite out of her food. And they charged us $27.20. With what we ordered that is a very reasonable price. We didn't have a problem with the cost at all. However, the fact that my mom hadn't touched her food was another story.   So we went up to the registrar to talk to the Nancy. She told my mom that well she played with her food, so she has to pay for it. And I quote \"Those who complain about the food complain about the price\". Again nothing is wrong with their prices. So I asked if they charged extra for the hair in my fruit. She said there was no hair in your fruit. If their was it was your. Okay, so I have brown almost black hair and my mom has auburn hair. Neither of us have light hair. However, When I informed her that it was light colored, she said no one who worked their had light colored hair (guess she never looked in the mirror).   So in the end we paid almost $30 for 3 eggs, toast and two cups of coffee.",

The best (and only in Las Vegas) kasha knishes.  Potato ones are also great.  Everything from breakfast to lunch very good on a big menu.  Have had lox, corned beef, brisket, matzoh ball soup, kreplach chicken soup, baked salmon, etc.  All very good.  The bagels are also the best in town, too.  Prices are very reasonable and the staff are always friendly. Good location, near the convention center, UNLV, and not far from the strip. The place to go in Las Vegas!",

Breakfast was good, but the star was my bagel!   It is so hard to find REAL bagels and the egg bagel i had at Harrie's was the real deal!  SO HAPPY!  SO SAD I DON'T LIVE IN VEGAS!  So, the decor is bizarre and the place is kind of old and odd, but the staff is friendly and helpful and the service is fast and the food is good.  Then, pick up bagels and cream cheese on your way out for tomorrow.  I will absolutely be back and I've been telling everyone to go!  Now, thanks to Yvonne, I'm dying to try the egg salad and the pickles!!!  GO HERE.",

    "text": "I have never written a bad review on Yelp - this will be my first one.  I have been coming to Harries Baglemania for about 10 years now, every April.  It was the first great Jewish Deli that I found in Las Vegas.  In my most recent trip, I saw that the old woman was no longer at the place.  I placed a simple order - a bagel lox and cream cheese, and a chicken soup - both always fantastic from Harries Baglemania.  Upon arriving back at my hotel, I discovered that there was no lox on the bagel, but lox spread.  I drove back to Harries, and they apologized, and replaced the sandwich.  Upon return to the hotel, we discovered that they were not using Nova Lox, but very salty plain lox (smoked salmon) which did not taste good (and was certainly not traditional).  In addition, the chicken soup was not using a real boiled chicken. I could clearly see that there were \"chicken cubes\" that looked like prepared chicken from a food service, as opposed to \"grandma boiling up the chicken in the back of the store\".   The fact that Harries was (and still is) a dump is part of the charm, if you are familiar with the old NY Jewish Deli's in New York (there are no \"nice looking\" real NY Deli's - they were all dumps, all built from struggling families) - but unfortunately, the \"love\" in the preparation of the food is no longer there. It's just a business for someone new.  With places like Bagel Cafe, and Canters both in Las Vegas, I will unfortunately be bringing my business elsewhere in the future.",

You seat yourself and the waitress come over promptly and the food comes out quickly. I've had the pastrami breakfast plate as well and it's amazing. Fresh bagel and cream cheese for sale in ten way out which is a plus. It's not in the best neighborhood but it's not really that bad either. Definitely with the stop",

    "text": "Sadly, I never had an Elvis sighting here in my many jaunts to Vegas and breakfasts at this place. Great homemade bagels- I am partial to the everything bagel, which is dense and soft and fresh and crunchy on the outside. Coffee is okay and hash and eggs are standard...but you're really just here for the bagels (and the Elvis sighting) so it's all good. A great place for cheap weekend brunch.",

    "text": "Loved this place!  Been to vegas for a conference and early morning was starving for some warm bagels and coffee. Harrie's Bagelmania was just the right place. Good location. Close to the strip. Cozy deli and warm service.   We had the Jalepeno bagel and french toast. Both arrived quickly and were delicious. I loved the fact that all their cream cheeses are lite. Our server was very warm and prompt.   The only negative was that the billing was very old fashioned. We had to give the lady our email address or phone number to get a copy of the receipt. Sort of dated that way. Other than that we had a wonderful experience and came back the next day for more :)",

The wife had their tuna on onion bagel, her moans of deliciousness was a testament to her enjoyment of the sandwich. She said it all when she stated-\"everything looks so good, we need to come here every day. \"",

    "text": "I am a regular and I have been a regular for at least 20 years (So, who's counting!)  This place is the mecca for a traditional nosh in Las Vegas.  The city's biggest movers and shakers have called this place home.  Burton Cohen was here every day for decades and I even found Siegfried having breakfast in the place.  Some things never change, such as, the grill is the size of a postage stamp.  I have felt sorry for the guys who have to work that grill and get the food out when the place is packed on the weekend.  So, don't be surprised that your eggs and potato pancakes might be a bit on the well done side because they've got that grill turned up too high.  The homemade soups are very good, as are the specials, cookies, fish etc.  However, the bagels and bialys are sublime!  I've eaten N.Y. bagels and I have bought bialys from Kossar's.  The Bagelmania bagels are just as good as the best N.Y. bagels, and Harrie's bialys are BETTER THAN KOSSAR'S!  There is no comparison.  So, if you want the best bagels in Las Vegas and the best bialys in the U.S., go to Harrie's.  The only reason I am giving them four not five stars is due to the grill being so darn small.  I loved Mort and when he died, his wife Nancy, who was never in the business, took over and I say, \"Thank the Lord,\" or I might have died from a case of severe bialy withdrawals.",
