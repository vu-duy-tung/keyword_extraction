I consider pasta a home dish and only rarely order it \"out\".  However, Dave's pasta selections are must haves. I still dream about the squid ink pasta with grilled shrimp in a saffron laced sauce. No matter what else I have, I have to have an order either to eat there or take home. My family (immediate and extended) cannot leave me alone about \"when are we going back for the pistachio pizza\".  The pistachio is an essential part of any meal you may partake there. We live in New York City a mecca for Italian food and I have yet to find a better place.  As an aside you must look closely at Annie's creative art work adorning every corner of the restaurant all of which is for sale. Don't leave without one of her works all of which are reasonably priced and most are one of a kind.",

    "text": "We have eaten here previously and had an excellent experience. So this time we returned to celebrate a special occasion and it started out terrific with a wonderful presentation of an Artichoke appetizer that was very tasty plus steamed mussels in a nice light red sauce. We chose two suggested specials and things went downhill from there. The so-called tiger shrimp with grilled pasta, broccoli and mushrooms was a disaster. The pasta was almost too hard to eat, the shrimp were just that - 6 very small overcooked tasteless and far from the size of a Tiger shrimp. The broccoli were just very tiny florets and the mushrooms yet even smaller, they were coated in what was a very salty Asian style sauce that did not pair up well with the dish.   The other special was a Salmon with pasta in a creamy pesto sauce. This was a typical presentation, tasty, but far from special. What was special is that we forgot to ask the price before ordering and was shocked to be charged $35 for each of the specials. With the average entree in the $17-20 range this was a bit much, particularly when the specials were less than, well, special. The other dish ordered was linguine with clams which was described as mostly tasteless.  The complimentary salad was very dry chopped romaine that was mediocre.  Desert was not remarkable but was satisfactory.   The bill for 3 was $135 which was a bit pricey for the sub-par forgettable fare. The service, however, was excellent and friendly. We will probably not be returning. Go for the appetizers and skip the over-priced specials.",

The best part was the we actually had Glenn (one of the brothers) wait on us due to a staffing issue. Apparently this never happens, well let me tell you.. Of course we will be back because the food was Fantastic, but having the opportunity to sit down and get to know Glenn himself was awesome. I even got some pasta to take home...Delish!

    "text": "First of all, if you decide to go here because of the other good reviews (which is why I came here) DO NOT buy a $10 for $20 deal because they automatically charge you 18% gratuity without informing you. The bill that we received tonight only had our entrees written down, the bottle of wine that we ordered was not written on the bill.... My boyfriend noticed a $16 charge and I'm so thankful he pointed it out because I overlooked it thinking it was just the tax.... The 18% was written very small, and looked like 8%... I would have ended up tipping these people TWICE....  I asked the waitress what the 18% was and she played dumb and said \"oh I think that's gratuity\" ... so when she returned a few minutes later after she ran my credit card I asked again if that was normal since we were only a party of 2.... She finally told me that 18% gratuity is included if you use any deals/coupons which I doubt she should have told me BEFORE she ran my credit card when I asked her..... !!!!!!!!IT DOES NOT SAY THAT ON THE DISCLAIMER FOR THE $10 FOR $20 DEAL!!!!!!!! It states 'gratuity not included, please tip on full amount' ---- shady shady shady shady!!!! You would have received a 20% tip if you didn't automatically and fraudulently charge me a tip already....I HATE SHADY-NESS..... SHAME ON YOU PASTA SHOP!!   I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE BACK! At first I really liked this place because I thought it was a mom and pop shop, I thought it was fun and different, but I can't believe the lack of disclaimer and the \"playing dumb\" that I just experienced. And you can only use either the $10 for $20 deal that you purchased or get the 1 lb. homemade pasta (which WAS part of the disclaimer but I still think that's stupid...)",

    "text": "Wow, where to begin? I guess first, as a former Henderson restaurant owner, it breaks my heart to have to Yelp my poor experience at a long established Italian restaurant. We have been going to the Pasta Shop since their Tropicana days. We have been to the newer Horizon Ridge location at least 10 times since they opened. Unfortunately, the last couple of times that we have been here since the Chef owner passed away, the service has been lacking. We have stayed away for most of the last year. Tonight we figured lets try it again with some friends. Well tonight sealed the deal for us to never, I mean NEVER come back!   We were a party of 5 tonight. 3 guys and 2 gals. The meal started with the salads being served to the 3 guys and not the gals, the gals salads took at least 5 minutes later???? Ok so we think maybe just a mix up or something. But still, serve the ladies first! Nope. So 4 of the group finished the salads but I am still working on mine. The waitress tries 3 separate times to take my salad. Wow. Can I finish it? Then, they serve 2 of us guys the main course but nothing for the ladies and my friend??? Then 5 minutes later our lady friend gets her entree? Ok, where is my wife's entree and my friends??? Well then my wife gets her entree 5 minutes later! Ok, by now we are thinking the Twilight zone has arrived. So we ask about our friend's lasagna, where is it??? The waitress says that is being made, mean while, 5 minutes later the table next to us that got sat after us, gets a lasagna. Nice. By this point we are just thinking that this place is not worth coming back. Then the waitress brings my friend another glass of wine and said that there was no charge for it. 20 minutes later the lasagna shows up! The rest of us have waited to eat our meals as our friends did not show up. Well as you can imagine our entree's have now gotten cold.   The ownership/manager never came over to our table to apologize and offer to remake our cold food? Then the waitress shows up to the table with a tiramisu and 2 small bags of pasta to take home with an apology. I ask for the check. The waitress brings our check and my wife asks if they removed the charge for the lasagna. No is the answer, seriously, wow???  At this point my wife gets up and asks for the owner/manager. The owner talks to my wife and is puzzled as to what happened and does not apologize but asks my wife if she should come to the table and apologize? Wow, crazy, you are operating a restaurant and you do not already know that you should have come to the table and apologized at least 20 minutes ago and offered a free bottle of wine or something else for the table while you took 20 minutes to bake the the missing lasagna that you gave to the other table and should have removed the lasagna from the check???  All of the aforementioned happened after we spent an hour telling our friends how good the food is at the Pasta Shop and convinced them to try it!",

Yes, the excellent Proseccos has a more varied menu, but I always leave Pasta Shop feeling that Iv'e just had one of the best meals ever. Whatever method and ingredients they are using for their fresh made pasta, it is always delicious. The green (spinach) fettuccine is great. The sauces are tangy with just the right amount of oil and garlic; robust but not overloaded. The seafood and meats are tender and fresh as well and the service is excellent. The food isn't to quick to come out of the kitchen (pre-made) but the wait isn't overly long either. We go on BYOB Wednesdays.",

From creative dishes like creamy-tomato teatro pasta, to traditional Italian favorites like eggplant Parmesan and lasagna, the food is fresh, flavorful and originally delicious.

Appetizers like the poached artichoke -- presented beautifully -- stand out from the ordinary fare available at the other Italian eateries around town. The atmosphere is equally exceptional.

The noodles tasted over cooked.  There was only four shrimp in the entire sea of pasta. The sauce didn't taste homemade it tasted bland. I enjoyed the salad and bread on the side, although, I could have made both of those easily at home. Unique in vibe but not unique in flavor. Also, I didn't get utensils or napkins but that's just me being petty. I plan to try a different dish, because this may have just been a bland option.",

Well dressed, which is unfortunately rare among many restaurants. The meal included gresh cheesy ciabatta garlic bread, which was superb. It wasn't overly cheesy or greasy. They really hit the appetizers on the money.  Unfortunately, entrees took a little longer than I'd like.  But the food was well worth the wait. It was easy to tell the pasta was freshly made. It was very well cooked and the sauce had excellent flavor.   Overall, I am impressed. Every other dish at the table tasted excellent.   My one criticism is the delay between getting our appetizers and our entrees. Overall it didn't actually take that long between when we ordered and when our entrees came out. However, having the salad and bread coming out immediately after ordering, then waiting the rest of the time for our entrees was a bit jarring. It messed with the pace of the meal.   Other than that, fabulous meal.",

I think the consensus of fellow Yelpers should give you a good sense of the place.  I was looking to get \"off campus\" from my stay on the Strip.  The Pasta Shoppe was worth the drive to nearby Henderson.    The atmosphere is definitely bistro/casual.     My meal featured a generous portion of fresh linguini crowned with in-shell Littleneck Clams The ceasar salad was a worthy accompaniment.   Add a great wait staff and an engaging owner-operator and my dining experience was complete.  As for the price points, it is all relative.  In comparison to some of the Strip restaurants I'd normally go to, TPS provided real value-and a welcome alternative for my dining dollar.",

Collectively, we tried the following:  Artichoke with Parmesan and balsamic vinegar Shrimp scampi Ravioli with white sauce Rigatoni with diced meatballs in a spicy red sauce Squid Ink Pasta with shrimp in a saffron cream sauce  Both the appetizers (the artichoke and shrimp scampi) were quite good.  Using the scrumptious cheese bread they give you to mop up the scampi sauce is a recommended tactic.    For entrees, I was anticipating the Squid ink pasta the most.  Unfortunately, this dish was a letdown.  The pasta was overcooked, so it lacked that al dente texture that you hope for when you visit to a place like this.  The saffron cream sauce was also lacking in flavor.  The clear winner was the rigatoni in a meat sauce.  Very hearty dish with a flavorful sauce and just enough spice.    I'd give the meal itself 3.5 stars, but with the exceptional service (and the fact that Yelp won't let you give partial stars), this place gets a 4/5.",

    "text": "Had a wonderful day kayaking up the Colorado River -- but with near freezing weather, a tired body, and of course, a hungry stomach, my family was looking forward for an awesome meal. Within an hour, we were on our way to the Pasta Shop.   Walk in and be welcomed by the sea of locals pouring in, the regulars -- the owner consistently addresses his loyal customers by their first name, giving some a hug, giving some a free glass of wine. Typical local joint. Definitely a plus.   To begin with, the restaurant has a very creative interior -- it's an art gallery as well. I was also interested to hear that the owner was the former personal chef of Frank Sinatra, but I was even more surprised to see that this restaurant received incredibly high Zagat ratings (27 for food).   I really want to stress that the service here was absolutely exemplary. Out of every single restaurant I have attended my entire life, this restaurant has the best service out of them all. All of our waitresses were incredibly attentive, kind, and willing to tolerate any little change we had -- my personal disliking of cheese was no problem for them, as they substituted my Caesar salad for a balsamic vinaigrette, and my cousins' nut allergy was promptly taken care of. Never once did we ask for more water -- it was consistently refilled. Despite my big Asian family's tendency to order a lot of food and ask for little changes on all of them, our waitresses always smiled and were happy to change it. For example, we wanted to change all the dishes with rigatoni to their famous home-made pasta -- and they had no trouble changing it. Service here is simply amazing.   In terms of food, I ordered the Frank's Favorite meat sauce -- their version of a bolognese -- and substituted rigatoni for home-made linguini. First things first, the pasta is CLEARLY home-made and yummy -- while a little too chewy for my personal preference and not \"al dente\" like I enjoy it, it was still quite good. The meat sauce, on the other hand, was a little unusual. I noticed on the menu that they do not cook meats in the sauce -- they \"finely chop\" meatballs. This was made incredibly salient early on; the sauce lacked the deep, earthy meat taste that it should have simply for that reason. In addition, there was some weird spice -- kind of minty, but kind of lemony -- that just through the meat sauce to an entire different taste that did not feel right. To be completely honest, the food here does not deserve a 27 on Zagat. The meat sauce just did not taste right and had some things missing -- but don't get me wrong, for as hungry as I was, this place definitely satisfied and was still quite delicious. I also tried my dad's Chicken Marsala, which was AWESOME. Order this if you come; the chicken was tender, perfectly well done, and incredibly flavorful.  The tiramisu was ordered for dessert and was also wonderful -- on par with other restaurants and an Italian bakery. Make sure you check in on Yelp for that free pound of pasta too!!!  To be concise, this place is good. But it's just that -- it's good. While the service here was just incredible, I really felt as if the 3.5 star rating was justified as the meat sauce just did not taste right. Definitely not deserving of a 27 rating, but definitely a place to check out when in Vegas or Henderson. Make the trip here, I'm strongly recommending it -- I simply just ordered the wrong thing, I'm sure.   Food: 23 | Service: 29 | Decor: 20",

My husband had the ravioli, and I had black ink shrimp pasta. My dish had a lot of butter, and the pasta not as fragrant as what I had at other restaurants. My dish was $26 just for the entree with a small salad.",

I ended up ordering the special which was lobster ravioli lobster cream sauce lobster chunks and salmon! Yeah that's what i said! Then the desert was fantastic. We washed down everything with a bottle of Cab from WA that was really good.  5 stars for me :)",

    "text": "The moment we walked in the place we were immediately greeted and asked if we had a reservation . We didn't, so we were placed at a small table towards the back of the restaurant.  Patrons with reservation were seated towards the front windows. By 6:30 the place was pretty full with only two small two tops available. Reservation are encouraged.   Three girls tag team the tables making sure we get drinks, give food orders and checked on us for drink refills.   The menu had a variety of classic Italian dishes. There was a special of the  day, today's it was salmon on lobster ravioli.  The menu also has a number of vegan options. There is a drink menu with cocktails and a nice selection of wines.  After looking over the menu we decided on the  Portofino, Mediterranean salad with Salmon, and shrimp scampi as appetizer. And a glass of Chianti.  Our waiter brought small Caesar salad with entrees and crunchy garlic bread served in a small colander.  The Portofino had 3 large scallops, 3 large shrimps and 4-5 clams on a perfect bed of pasta. Topped with fresh ribbons of basil. The Mediterranean salad had crunchy romaine lettuce with sliced tomatoes, red onions, black olives and chunks of feta cheese. On top was a juicy and well seasoned Salmon. Shrimp scampi  4 large shrimps in a buttery lemon sauce.  The restaurant was lightly lit, lots of lights pointed towards the walls that showcased local artists. On a large cork board was more artisan jewelry.   Many of the patrons at nearby tables must frequent the restaurant as the wait staff hanged by their tables and chatted . The wait staff was always bring out plates and checking on the table.  Overall our dinner was good.  My only complaint is that they do not offer freshly ground black pepper or Parmesan cheese.    2 entrees  Appetizer  And glass of wine under $100 = perfect date night",

    "text": "Finally got to try Pasta Shop for dinner. We arrived right when they opened at 5:00 for dinner. We were greeted as we walked in and asked if we had reservations, which we did not. Only one table was occupied. We were told we could sit outside or at a hightop but all other tables were reserved. We decided on the hightop.   We were sad to hear that Chef/owner David Alenik had just passed away on Sept. 15th. There is a very nice photo and memorial of him on the wall.   Water and \"garlic cheese bread\" were delivered to the table. We placed our drink orders as well as our entrees. We chose the baked rigatoni with a side of meatballs and the calamari steak and shrimp which was a special of the evening. Both came with caesar salad which was quickly brought out. Simple, with romaine, croutons and shaved parmesan it was a nice start.   My other half's baked rigatoni arrived with his side of meatballs. I tried one of the meatballs and it was just okay, a little dry for my taste. A good 5-6 minutes went by before my entree came out, a pet peeve of mine. I thought the calamari steak entree was excellent. The calamari and the shrimp were charred perfectly and served over bow tie pasta with a garlic scampi sauce. As good as it was, the $38 price was not justified.   Like the meatballs, the baked rigatoni was very average. We both said we have had better. We ordered tiramisu for dessert and again it was just average, we have definitely had better. The service throughout our dinner was excellent with waters refilled quickly and plates removed when needed.   As we were leaving we noticed that many tables were still empty, not used the entire time we were there. Others came in without reservations and were offered tables. We may come back and give it another try, but it won't be anytime soon.",

Made mistake of ordering Pizza at a non-pizzarea(needed more sauce and crust soft & chewy). Full size salad was HUGE.   Will try again and will order Lasagna.

When it opened a location on Horizon Ridge, I knew I must try it since I am running out of excuse to not!   I came here with my brother on a Thursday night. From the outside, you wouldn't know this place was packed. Once we were inside, you get this artsy, I-know-the-food-must-be-good-here kind of feeling. We were seated right away even though there were only three people running the place.   The guy who sat us was very nice and seemed happy to be doing what he was doing. We placed our drink orders not long after. The menu was not crazy extensive (like Cheesecake Factory), which I personally prefer.   I ordered the clams and linguine in a rose sauce, and the brother ordered the chicken alfredo. I really like my linguine more than another local Italian restaurant that is just around the corner on Eastern, but the sauce was a little bit too salty. The chef must have forgotten that the clams have salt from the ocean. Anyways, pasta-wise, it was good.   I had a bite of the chicken alfredo, and I loved it! The sauce was lighter than any alfredos I have ever tasted. The pasta was absolutely fresh fresh fresh! I was kind of disappointed that I didn't order the chicken alfredo. My brother finished the whole plate.   They also served us a caesar salad and warm cheesy bread. The salad - I can do without, but the bread was absolutely delicious! I would have gotten more if I hadn't ordered a pasta.   Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a plate of fresh homemade pasta. Enjoy!",

The setting is intimate, location is close to home (good or bad thing, I haven't decided yet), and the decor..um..well.. I can appreciate the fact this venue is supporting local art.  I'm not sure if the decor consists of several local artists or just one in particular, but the walls are covered in very eccentric art pieces.  Lets get to the good stuff.. the FOOD! A table of (7) and I for the most part decided to take advantage of the Restaurant Week set menu which consisted of a delicious caprise salad, Cesar salad, main course (spinach fettuccine in a garlic sun-dried tomato sauce with chicken), and for dessert..one of the BEST homemade cannoli's I've ever had!  Our server was attentive and our drinks rarely were empty and overall I would most certainly make the Pasta Shop a regular venue to feed my Italian food craving.  The price is a little high for standard pasta, but we are not talking past out of a box people, we are talking freshly made pasta daily!  Fresh pasta, delicious ingrediants and the best cannoli in town.. Pasta Shop is your place.",

The interior decor of the restaurant kind of reminds me of Firefly tapas bar.  It kind of has a spanish/rustic feel to it (even though it's an Italian restaurant) but it's fine.  The owner's wife is a welder (or used to be), so she did all the crafty interior decor of this place.    Very small space.    The pastas are quality and fresh.  I've had the shrimp scampi and the linguine with rose clam sauce.  All taste amazing.  The dishes are a bit pricey, but the quality of food is excellent.",

We had appetizers Brussels sprouts, Bruschetta, tapenade, wonderful garlic bread, Caesar salad ( we ask for a balsamic vinaigrette and it was so light) and shared a Fettuccini with meatballs. Everything tasted like my Italian's grandma's cooking, fresh ingredients, al dente homemade pasta, tomatoes sauce that tasted like the real deal..  Gabby our waitress was so kind, smiley and never interrupted our conversation! Perfect service!!! The pacing of the meal matched our mood too, not too fast, not too slow... will come back again real soon!!! Easy parking, fun artsy decor, go check out the bathroom!",

So when I saw pasta shop on yelp, we dared to give it a chance and crossed our finger that it wouldn't disappoint us. When we got there, we were greeted by a lovely older lady. Her face showed warmth and when she spoke to us, she made us felt welcomed. I showed her my check in on yelp and I got a free bag of homemade pasta. A younger lady was our waitress. She was friendly also. And the food, OH MY GOODNESS! It was so delicious. All entrees come with garlic bread and Caesar salad. My husband doesn't usually eat salad but after he took a first bite he said it was delicious. I ordered the baked rigatoni with chopped meatballs. Loved it! My husband had the chicken Alfredo and it was creamy and tasty. Both pastas were al dente, just how we like it. My son had half of the cheese pizza which was 4 BIG slices and he ate 3 of them. That showed how delicious they were. To finish our dinner we had the cookies and cream gelato and tiramisu and they were all HEAVEN! Finally a pasta place that satisfy our taste buds!!! I can't wait to go back and try other dishes.",

    "text": "First I will say great location and beautiful space. Our waitress was very nice as well.   Unfortunately our meals were a basic pasta with very minimal flavor nothing amazing. We got salmon Alfredo which had a 6oz or so of salmon and a basil pasta with no meat. Cost was normal for an upscale italian about $60 for the 2 pasta dinners and a single glass of wine. Which btw wasnt poured table side which I think is tacky and a sad thing in such a nice restaurant. BUT as it grew busy and we were just finishing the male waiter asked with menus in hand while 2 guest eyeballed us anxiously for people he wanted to seat if we were done. Everyone....EVERYONE usually gets shown a lovely dessert platter and asked if they like dessert and coffee after. Not us just are you finished? We had planned on dessert and coffee and wanted our left overs that he quickly ushered away to pack up. But no a bill dropped in front of us. Obviously they are much more concerned with turn over than quality and service and MOST important customer satisfaction. Next time we will just trek down to strip to a hotel and go to a Italian restaurant there.",

The homemade pasta is ok, the Alfredo sauce was run of the mill, chicken was average and the salad was iceberg lettuce. The dressing on the Mediterranean salad was very good and the Caesar was average.  Also, no fresh cracked pepper or fresh grated cheese offered for the salads. For the price there are better options.  At $20 and more for an entree my expectations were higher.",

I went with my friend who is vegan (I am not) as she heard they had a special vegan menu. So the restaurant offers options for those who are looking for special menus, as well as delicious offerings for those seeking regular Italian dishes as well. It is locally owned and the owner came to our table to explain the specials as well as the vegan menu and even sent out some vegan salads for us to try on the house. Their bread is delicious and for my friend they brushed it with olive oil instead of butter - it was great! I was eating light that night so only got a salad with grilled chicken but it was very good. They have a cute little patio out front which I would love to try next time as we sat inside this time. Will definitely be coming back. This place is like a breath of fresh air in Henderson and Las Vegas in general!",

    "text": "I have seen the reviews for this restaurant for months and wanted to try it. We were really excited to check it out. Read reviews the day before booking. Looked at all the photos for the dishes. And finally decided to book a reservation.  It's a cute enough place, but let's just say for the prices the menu is commanding if you show up for dinner you expect a little more than what it offers as a cute little lunch place. Our final bill with tip was $135. Yet even though we had made a reservation for a particularly late hour (the place was half empty), we were told we could have a high top or the table in front of the door. There were several other tables available, but when we asked about them, the owner said they were \"spoken for.\" Ironically, they remained empty the whole time we were there.  We had the artichoke appetizer. It was nicely prepared and well dressed. No complaints. Our salads came and they were simple but well dressed. Nothing to crow about really. I had the squid ink pasta with shrimp in creme sauce. I was really excited about this dish and it was good. I'm not sure whether it was $29 good, but I'm not cheap so normally I wouldn't care about that if it's a dish I can't get anywhere else. The pasta was nice, dense and the cream sauce was flavorful. It was a lot better than than the linguine and clams in rose sauce that my fiance had, which frankly she hated. We should have sent it back, but she insisted we didn't. But it didn't make her happy much.    What I did care about later were the details. Our waitress was clueless about service. We ordered a bottle of wine - of which there are none below $35. We ordered one that was $44 and you might expect that for that price it would come with someone who actually knows how to uncork the bottle. But no. She fumbled through it. Cute as a button that girl but not a single clue about how to serve a table decently. We asked for parmesan cheese (which she never offered) and she brought us a bowl of shaved parmesan. Which she didn't bother to serve. We asked if they had grated and she said that was all they had. Umm. Okay.   For all the raving about this place, I didn't see much of any of what was mentioned. We were there on a slow night and we never saw the owner once he sat us. He never came by. Our food was served pretty basically for an expensive place, and we kind of treated like they really didn't care if we were there. The food we had didn't warrant the prices. And neither did the wine.   We're big fans of Buon Gusto and maybe have just become way too accustomed to great food served by people without pretension. We should have gone there instead. We would have paid almost half and everything we've had there has been awesome.  As best as I can tell, this place has a bunch of regular friends who are visitors who warrant special seating and write great reviews for them. I didn't see any of the amazing things that people are raving about - and believe me I wanted to because this place is a stone's throw from my house and I was really hoping it would totally blow my mind.   I don't think we'll be returning. If the food was  just okay and the service was stellar or vice versa, that would different.",

    "text": "Our fifth and final meal for Spring Restaurant Week was at Pasta Shop Ristorante in Anthem. They had two price points for the RW menu $30.13 and $50.13. The former was the better deal. The difference between them was the entree and dessert. Seafood vs. Chicken or Sausage and Cannoli vs. Tirimisu. They willingly substituted dessert.   We started with Fresh Mozzarella and Roma Tomato and Caesar Salad. The Caprese was fantastic, simple and fresh, quality ingredients. The Caesar was too lightly dressed, this is a rare complaint from me. I enjoy lightly dressed salads, but the taste of the romaine overpowered any other flavor. Leaves on their own are pretty boring.   The husband had the Mediteranean Sausage over pasta. I had the Portofino with Fresh Shellfish in a Fra Diablo Sauce over Linguine. The sausage was very good with excellent flavor. The linguine was also quite tasty. The shellfish varied, the shrimp and scallops were tender and properly prepared. The clams and mussels were overcooked and very chewy. I also expected the dish to be spicy, but it was not. All in all, the Portofino was fine, but it had the potential to be more enticing.   Finally, we finished with tiramusi and cannoli. Both were enjoyable. The Pasta Shop is great neighborhood find. I'm glad we were given the excuse to give it a try. If in the area, I'd return to sample more of their housemade pastas.",

However, I've eaten here 3-4 times and I think the service is borderline rude at times and other times indifferent.  Not what I would expect from a family owned business and I absolutely love going away from chains and supporting local.  Especially for Italian.  So I'm disappointed to write this review.  I've taken two different groups here and was slightly embarrassed at my choice at the end of both meals.",

    "text": "Another hidden gem thanks to Yelp.  I was in the area and decided to try this place out because of the solid reviews on Yelp. Glad I did. I tried the chicken parm, which is my usual order at a new Italian restaurant. Every Italian restaurant has chicken parm on the menu, so it works as a good barometer.  All dinner entrees come with a small basket of cheese bread and Caesar salad. Nice touch. The chicken parm was very good. The chicken portion was ample. They were also very generous with the mozzarella cheese on top. The marinara sauce on the side of pasta pomodoro had good flavor and was spiced well. The pasta was cooked perfectly and was fresh.  At $18, the chicken parm was a bit pricey. Not necessarily expensive, but not a deal either. You are paying a bit for the atmosphere, decor, and service, which I don't mind doing on occasion. This would definitely be a good date spot.",

I could see this definitely being a good dinner spot if i lived on this side of town.    We came here for lunch and had the Shrimp Fra Diablo which came with 4 large shrimp and linguine which wasn't quite al dente as I liked but I enjoyed the fresh pasta and it had a nice chew.   The sauce had a nice kick and it paired well with the garlic bread they gave which they gave seconds.  I would come back for their fresh pastas but if i had to choose one neighborhood Italian spot on the Henderson side i d recommend Montesano's.  P.S - they offer a very generous 1st time check in for a free LB of pasta.  this bumped it up from 3.5 to 4 stars.",

I decided to try one of my favorites, rigatoni primavera, but with the gluten-free brown rice pasta substitute. I knew it would be good, but holy cannoli it was AMAZING!  I've recently became vegan for health reasons. Lucky for me PSR has plenty of veggie, vegan, and gluten-free options that are to die for. Honestly, the gluten-free pasta is just as good, if not better than the normal pasta. Next time I will try the whole wheat pasta!  Overall great spot for traditional pastas and healthy pastas.  Oh ya the art is the cherry on top! bring the family or your beautiful date!  ITS A MUST",

Hubby got chicken Marsala and that was also very good.  We were too stuffed to have dessert but they have pineapple upside down cake. Can you believe it?! Maybe next time.

I was a little disappointed they didn't have any with vegan cheese but settled for trying the classic ( basically spaghetti and meatballs vegan edition) and my bf has the fettuccine. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with the meal. It didn't have any flavor and was bland tomato sauce with noddles. I think restaurants who claim to cater to the vegan clientele should try a little harder instead of falling into a flavorless version of their regular menu items. My boyfriend loved his fettuccine and it was packed with cracked pepper, garlic and cheesy bread with herbs while mine had literally (no nothin) with a sprig of basil on top. I gave them three stars since he liked the meal but vegan version was honestly a two.",

The sauce was the right amount of spicey for this spice wimp. The kale and broccoli were a nice touch. All the indulgence of a pasta dish w very little guilt..I'm sold.

I had a recent relapse and ended up here with Bethany E for their Restaurant Week dinner specials. Worth it! The artsy, eclectic location is great for catching up with a friend or a low-key dinner date.   We started with simple Caesar salads and garlic cheese bread, then shared the Shrimp Fra Diablo and Rigatoni Primavera with chicken. The pastas were clearly fresh-made, and the portion sizes were such that our leftovers made another full meal. Though I liked the linguini, the sauce was not at all spicy like I'd expected and seemed to be missing something- maybe adding fresh shredded cheese would have helped amp this up a bit. The Rigatoni dish was light and vibrant with lots of fresh vegetables, making it a healthier guilt-free option. I'm not especially fond of cannoli but appreciated that the version served here was freshly filled to order.  Keeping this spot on my short list of options when I need to eat my feelings or when I'm powering up for a half-marathon. Great neighborhood spot, check the register area for art and jewelry available for purchase. Don't forget to check in on social media for a free bag of fresh pasta!",

However, finally having the time to try it, we enjoyed it and came back again.  The restaurant here serves exactly what their name states. Pasta, fresh made pasta that is simple, tasty and also creative. you can find your basics as well as more of the creative items.  1. Portofino - Well, of course I found and decided on the pasta that had the most resemblance to my favorite Cioppino.  The Portofino is fresh shellfish served over linguine.  Plenty of shellfish and a very al dente linguini accompanied this dish. Rather expensive, but hey we live in the desert, so i understand that getting fresh shellfish can be tough.  2. Teatro - The next time I came here, I tried the Teatro.  Pappardelle pasta in a cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms. Again, the highlight of this dish is the pasta and the pappardelle was again just perfect. Loved the nice, wide noodle. I also added a side of meatballs with this dish. I could have added chicken, but hey, meatballs sound great in an Italian restaurant.  3.  Franks Favorite Meat Sauce- Meatballs in a tomato sauce over rigatoni, this is a version of bolognese I would say and my wife ordered this. she normally goes for Lasagna, and she did have this on her first visit. Well presented, good amount of pasta, and a new favorite for us.  4. Vegetarian Pizza - We ordered this for take out on the second visit.  We made this vegan for the daughter. I am so happy that they have vegan options. The first time she had the linguine below.  5.  Spinach Linguine EVOO & Garlic- For our first visit, this is what our daughter ordered as a vegan option.  This is a unique and very excellent aglio 3 olio style pasta and the Spinach linguine was a hit.  6.  Chicken Marsala - Our son ordered this and he loved it. Good amount of chicken and for all of you that like Chicken Marsala, you will be happy ordering this dish.  The mushrooms, the little onions, all poured over the home made linguini.  a bit of sauce and cream and there you have it, a classic dish that is elegant and flavorful.  7.  Lasagna - We ordered this on our first visit and what a classic dish. This is the standby dish that the wife orders at nearly every Italian restaurant to gauge and compare food quality. She gave this a thumbs up.  The service here is top notch.  The ambiance is eclectic.  The art work is on display and for sale. We were able to see the artist / owner sitting at a table talking and eating with friends.    We enjoyed a few glasses or wine, some great food and basked in great service.  Can't ask for more.  GK says, check it out.",

There's art and jewelry on the walls for sale and the whole place is bright and welcoming. They had a special Mother's Day menu but we opted for the Teatro, Ravioli Bianca, and Lasagna. Caesar salads and cheese bread are included, which is everything I ever want with my pasta dishes!  We asked which of the pastas were fresh and they said the pappardelle, linguine, and lasagna sheets. The Teatro was unbelievable. The sauce was creamy but light and the pasta was thick and fresh. The browned butter and pistachios of the ravioli were also a highlight. I definitely recommend this place for an intimate lunch or dinner.",

I've never had a dish I didn't like, but their salmon with lobster ravioli special has left a lasting memory. Every meal comes with caesar salad and bread. They have a good wine selection. You can bring your own wine for a $25 cork fee. Any coupons usually aren't accepted on the weekends and that includes Fridays. The art is for sale. They have vegan options. There is outdoor seating available if the weather is fair. This place is good for a birthday or anniversary dinner. Enjoy",

We got there right before the rush. We get our drinks and we order but the people that got there after us, they got there salad and bread before we even got our salad and bread.  The waitress's were a little friendly but you can definitely tell they were paying MORE attention to the other guest! We get our food and my dish is ok nothing to be aww about. But my husbands dish was good! The sauces were completely different! I like that sauce better! I got the chicken parm and my husband got franks sauce! We get done with dinner and they ask us if we want dessert, we said yes. When the waitress came she threw the menu at us and continued to help the other guest! At this point we were ready to leave. If we do go back I'm definitely getting what my husband got. But I'm not sure when that will be!   Hope this helps fellow yelpers!   Have a great day!",

He has mentioned this place a couple times, but I never looked it up. Last night we brought our kids there for a family date. We made a reservation on OpenTable, and got there about 5 mins late. Our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was full, but it's not a large place and not too loud. I recommend reservations on a Saturday night, as tables cleared out, people came in. Not until 7:30 was half the restaurant empty enough to just walk in.   The food was amazing. I got the Baked Rigatoni, and I could see it was a popular dish. It was soooo good. My husband got Ravioli Bianca, which was a very light dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly. My son just had meatballs and they were very good as well-not frozen.   So happy we found this place, and can't wait to bring family here.",

    "text": "My wife and I went there last night after referrals from two of her work colleagues.  It's a small place and reservations are a good idea, my wife called to place reservations and left a message on voicemail, a little disappointed she could not speak to a real person but she was nicely surprised when David called her back to confirm our reservations and that he was looking forward to serving us. Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly, service was excellent and the servers were knowledgable about the menu. We ordered a shrimp appetizer which was delicious (it could have been a little hotter for me, but my wife said it was good).  The Caesar Salad was fantastic, chilled plates, just enough dressing with a nice hint of anchovy and just the right size. Our main dish came out, little neck clams in a white wine sauce for me and raviolis for my wife, with a side of meatballs.  The clams were very good, could have used more garlic for me but then I am a garlic nut, most of the pasta is home made and is probably the best pasta I have had outside of my wife's kitchen.   We will be going back for sure, it's not cheap I would say above average but well worth it.  After we had paid the bill and we just about to leave, David stopped by to thanks us for dining with them and gave us a free ziplock bag of fresh homemade pasta to take home. A great little place with great food, great wine and a pleasing atmosphere.  As a side note, any art nuts out there he has a bunch of cool stuff from local artists around the restaurant that are for sale and are pretty cool.",

A solid choice is the cheesy bread to start and the shrimp fradiavlo- rivaled by no one. Chef David and his sweet wife Annie (who makes the art decorating the place) are great people, and this local establishment is a real gem in the Henderson culture. Go here!",

The owner's wife is a talented artist and her wall sculptures and paintings decorate the ristorante .  Giana the manager was the one that waited on us. She was warm and friendly. She seems to really love her job. (we assumed she was an owner)  I ordered the special with scallops (to die for), salmon and a yummy homemade pasta (which Giana actually gave us a sample of to take home) in a white wine caper sauce.  My hubsand ordered the Franks meat sauce pasta. Which he said it was one of the the most delicious he has ever tasted.  This little family ristorante  is a jewel. And we cannot wait to return. Molto Buona!!!",

    "text": "On the recommendation of friends and several fellow reviewing Yelpers, Diane and I recently embarked on a 45-minute ride to Henderson from North Las Vegas to see if the pasta here lived up to its billing.  It did!  After sampling a very good bowl of White Bean Soup with carrots as the soup of the day, followed by a very good Caesar Salad with croutons, Mozzarella Cheese, and a light dressing, I eagerly dove into a large portion of the Mediterranean Sausage dish as my entree.  This steaming hot concoction featured sweet Italian Sausage, Red Bell Pepper, sweet onions, oregano, and Kalamata Olives in a robust Tomato Sauce ladled over really fresh rigatoni.  Although the sausage was indeed sweet, my main was nicely spicy as a whole.  It was an excellent hot pasta offering.  Diane enjoyed her specially requested Rigatoni Alfredo with Tiger Shrimp.  And decadent Ganache-covered Cookies & Cream Gelati capped off a fine introduction to a ristorante with stellar food.  Seating was comfortable in a rather intimate, informal setting.  And we were afforded fine and pleasant service.  Because of a Yelp check in offer, we received a bag of fresh fettuccine on our way out of the restaurant.  That pasta tasted great too, and turned out to be a portion big enough to support four large helpings of Spaghetti, Meatballs, & Mushrooms served up at home over the course of one dinner and one lunch.  Bravo to the Pasta Shop's pasta maker!",

There is very limited seating so be sure to get your reservation in as soon as you can. When we went inside there was live entertainment going on, which lasted half our visit. The 16\" pizza I had was excellent, plus I had the half Cesar salad. Will recommend to everyone. Best Italian food around!",

Apparently the chef in this restaurant used to be a cook for Frank Sinatra and Steve Wynn. We can see why.  The restaurant itself is stylish and elegant and offers local art for sale, it was tastefully decorated and very warm and inviting  The food was fantastic, in fact better than fantastic it was sensational.  Some of the best Italian food I've had in my life, brussels sprout appetizer was amazing and I almost ordered one to go, my wife had a lobster salmon special and I myself had fettucine with shrimp. To top it off at the end we took the recommendation of another reviewer and tried the pineapple upside down cake which was also fantastic. I highly recommend this place",

The Pasta Shop is a cross between a restaurant & Art Gallery. Most of the art wouldn't be on my home, but that's OK!    The menu isn't huge, however it is CONSISTENT! Which is always better than a lot of mediocre selections~    We don't usually go out on NYEVE but their email with the 2 prix fixed menus along with something local (away from the craziness of the Strip) was VERY appealing.     All the food was really good, came out timely (which it always has, BTW!) and tasted DEELISH! (Like always!) their ONLY weak spot would be dessert. cannoli shell quite thick, filling is good tho, sweet but good! Not much imagination however many restaurants fall into weakness in this category.     All the servers are younger gals, very polite, friendly & know the menu. Not constantly trying to upsell every course  which I appreciate VERY much.     Very much a locals kind of place serving VERY good Italian  food. Moe Rocca would LUV it too!",

Not having a closing time makes it hard for me because I don't like being that customer that walks in 30 minutes before closing. The other reason was because it is a little pricy to make it a once a week or so place.",

I know they are in the process of moving into a new location... So, first off, our water had a very strange odor.  Smelled like stale freezer.  Food arrived fairly quickly.  Service was decent. I had the eggplant parmesan, was sooo gooey.  There was about an inch of cheese covering the eggplant, I wasn't sure it was really in there. Hubby had the saffron shrimp saute with squid ink pasta.  The shrimp was really dry and the pasta lacked a bit of flavor.   Pretty pricey, will not be returning.",

The owner introduced himself to us early in the evening and never forgot our names the entire evening.  After ordering, our salads came out and our meals did not tough the table until we were done with the salads.  Excellent timing in firing the food to table.  The ambiance was that of a small bistro, very comfy.  I wasn't very impressed with the art hanging from the ceiling that was for sell but if that being the only complaint no reason not to come and enjoy this little jewl of  Vegas.",

A little like the dearly departed Jazzed (moment of silence for one of all-time Vegas favorites.) Friendly, timely service, which you'd expect from one of the owners. Went with a suggestion of mussels ($13) to start and they were awesome. Star of the night - big but not gamey.  The salad course was unremarkable, but good enough. The bread, though, was strong and perfect to clean up the tomato/mussel broth.  We went with an entree (chicken davida, $18) and a big app (half Bianco pizza, $11) for the main course. Go figure: the pizza blew away the entree, which proved heavy and underseasoned. It was fine, just not something I'd race back to have again. The pizza was strong, using tarragon and cashews to create something different and tasty. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  My wife had a house red ($7) - table wine at best, sweet grape juice at worst.   So I pull a half-star for the semi-miss on the entree and a full one for price. Before tip, we checked in at $55 for what amounted to a glass of wine, two apps and an entree. Quality food, yes, but that's a little rich for my blood for what we ate.",

    "text": "Any respectable Italian restaurant makes their own pasta and The Pasta Shop is no exception. When the pasta is fresh, it is meant to be the focus of the dish and the linguine with clams that I ordered was a great way to really enjoy the pasta: linguine with a simple and delicious butter and clam juice sauce. It came with plenty of clams and had the perfect amount of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some spice. My only complaint with the dish was that the clams could have used a little more rinsing.   The basic Caesar salad that came with dinner was lacking. The two croutons on the plate were unpleasant in taste and texture and the lettuce was not picked through thoroughly. The little pieces of garlic bread were tasty.   It is a little more expensive than your average Italian restaurant, but I consider it a premium for freshly made pasta. Not too many places make their own pasta anymore and The Pasta Shop does make some of the best.",

What a surprise this restaurant was because it was delicious.  The homemade pasta is the best we've had in Vegas so far.  This is a very very small little place in a strip mall, and there was hardly anyone there.  All the art on the walls is made by a local artist and for sale.  They had some homemade night lights that I thought were so cool that I almost bought one, and I might get one next time we go.  All the tables are also unique and painted by the same artist.    Eating here made us feel like we were eating at someone's home for dinner, as we were warmly welcomed and talked to as if they wanted to get to know us.  I ordered the Portofino which was a delicious spicy tomato sauce over linguine with nice juicy clams, good size tiger shrimp and scallops.  All the seafood was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't have been happier with the dish.  Husband got the Ravioli Pomodoro, which he was extremely pleased with and said it was the best homemade ravioli and sauce he had ever had.  The best part about the food was the chef himself served us after he had cooked the meal and talked to us for awhile.  The meals were served with hot crusty bread and a small light caesar that was very good.  I have not eaten at Nora's like some here on yelp have compared this place to, but the prices were very reasonable and the service was outstanding.  I can only compare this place to Gaetano's, and Pasta Shop is much better than Gaetano's easily in every way.  This was one of the few times we have tipped over the 18% that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> requires the restaurant to tack on the bill, it was that good.  Call first before you go because their hours are limited.  We got there at 7pm during 100+ degree weather and they were getting ready to close when we left.  We will be making this a frequent dinner destination for sure.",

I try to find the gems OFF the strip and this is, without a doubt, on the top of my list.  First step in, I loved the decor.  It felt cozy and comfortable... feels like home.  And all of the employees make you feel as such- that you are at home and you are all a big family.  When the chef came out to check on us, you could tell he loves what he does and this is such a passion for him.  The friendliness and ambiance won me over.  The food is delicious.  The most enjoyable dishes I have had have always been the specials of the evening.  One night they serve a chilled artichoke with a balsamic reduction.  It was prepared so nicely I could have eaten one of an appetizer and one for an entree.  Five stars all around.",

They are for sale, $300 for a crudely done piece of a silhouette of four drink glasses. But we didn't go there to look at the amateurish artwork, we went for the food.  My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan, and I had the saffron shrimp saute, grilled shrimp in a saffron cream sauce with squid ink pasta. The service was good, no complaints there.     To start, the water had an odd odor, kind of like old food from a freezer. The food arrived quickly. The eggplant was just two thick slices of eggplant covered in marinara sauce and cheese. The eggplant still had the skin on, not that it mattered because it was mush. So it was like eating sauce and (a lot) of cheese with a flavorless mush. The shrimp on my pasta was overcooked and dry. The pasta was good, but let's face it, it's pasta. Not worth the $24 price.   Will not return. And they are moving to a new location on Horizon Ridge, FYI",

The food was good but not memorable and the sauce had so much salt.  The tomato sauce for the polenta and the pasta was way over salted.

The chicken Marsala was bland and noodles were waaayyy over cooked. The complimentary salad had little to no taste and DID NOT taste like Caesar salad. The croutons are good. I will not be coming back to this establishment. It looked promising and the atmosphere was cool, but the price for the food is not worth it! I spent $43 for 2 CHICKEN pasta dishes (that don't cost much to make) and felt robbed AND hungry. Maybe the fact that most of the sauce from the Marsala can be found in my car or on my carpet is the reason for a bad review, but the food speaks for itself.  It IS NOT WORTH IT! To think I tipped the person that inevitably ruined my car and my hallway. Such a shame. Try this place if you like I hope you get better service and food than I did. Good luck!",

The salad that comes with the meal is a nice touch, but portion of salad is very small.

That surprised me because there were so many social media prompts at the site itself. So here goes a full review, with a suggestion: Ambience: Soooo very cute! The tables and walls are art. Not kiddie art, either. There is a level of sophistication here that should be acknowledged. Additionally, there is local art for sale--what a GREAT opportunity. Eating pasta, drinking wine, and shopping. Mmmmmmm  Now for the service: The servers seem to know the food as well as anyone in the kitchen. The ingredients we're relayed and the nuance of preparation was clearly explained.  The Food: My husband had the pasta with sweet sausage in a beautiful marinara. The pasta was perfectly cooked and so obviously fresh. There is nothing better in the world, culinary related, than fresh pasta-- unless it is that that pasta is combined with engaging sauce and unctuous meat. This dish fulfilled that need. I had the EVOO salad with rice & cashews. Nice; nothing spectacular.   Recommendation: I wish there were a \"Healthy/Hearty\" menu. Kind of like Skinny Fats does. I think this place would be packed and everyone would know of its' existence.  The prices were great  and the overall experience was enjoyable. I will be back.",

I ordered the chicken Alfredo and my girlfriend ordered the chicken parmesan. My sause for my chicken Alfredo was rather watery and bland but the pasta was cooked perfectly aldente. My girlfriend's red sause was amazing and totally worth the money. The thing here is I got the more expensive dish and it was bland and watery and my girlfriend got a cheaper dish and it was deliousious. The service here is okay it took a while to get refills and things like that. One thing I will say is their wine selection is delicious I do wish they had pairing for the dishes but unfourtunly that was not provided. Oh I almost forgot while we are sitting eating The ENTIRE time The floor was shaking and caused are chairs to shake it wasn't alot but it was enough to make you feel uneasy as you are your dinner. The red sause was worth the money but not the white. I would recommend saving a couple bucks by going somewhere else for your pasta.",

I tried the eggplant parmesan and of the meager offering for beer, the Stone IPA with a 6.9% alcohol in an IBA of 71. It was pretty good.  Dinners range from $18 to $35 with an average around the $24 range without appetizers and drinks. Dinners include salad and bread.  The Caesar salads that came with our meals were excellent and the appetizer we had, the brussel sprouts, was also very good.  By 7pm on a Saturday evening the place was packed and rather noisy.  I was skeptical. But the food was  marvelous. We would strongly recommended this place for wonderful Italian food.",

We had our choice of seating in a quaint dining room area.  The decor is funky with various artwork.  Our waitress for the evening was attentive and lovely.  She provided great service during our visit.    The restaurant week menu starts with a Caesar Salad with garlic cheese ciabatta bread.  It was good and fresh.  I love the shaved parmesan vs. shredded grated parmesan.  We were off to a good start.  For the second course, I chose the Shrimp Fra-Diablo and Stefany chose the Rigatoni Primavera with Chicken so we could each try a little of each.  The shrimp dish was kind of a let down.  The spicy red sauce wasn't all that spicy. The sauce was a bit bland and needed a little help.  The Rigatoni was not too exciting for me either. The chicken was too plain but the vegetables were fresh and abundant.    For the third course is their homemade cannoli.  Now if you're an Italian place you better get the cannoli right.  They nailed it.  Fresh light crispy shell with an indulgent filling and lightly drizzled with chocolate.    I'm not opposed to stopping in to try other menu items but it's not a rush for me.",

I ordered the Ravioli Pomodoro, and it was just pasta stuffed with bland, watery, cheese and covered with a really bland and thin marinara sauce.  I also tried the lasagna,the baked rigatoni, the sausage and the meatballs. They were all passable, but so bland and boring. I would rather eat the pre made stuff they churn out at Olive Garden, and spend half as much money.  The service was great and it's a nice little restaurant, but I think it's a place for senior citizens whose taste buds are dead but who enjoy going out and spending a good chunk of money on a nice meal. I probably just caught them on an off night.",

The cheesy garlic bread was served warm and was delicious. Lobster ravioli, squid ink pasta and the Frank's favorite pasta were all perfect and over exceeded expectations.   Now I am waiting for my flourless chocolate cake.... I doubt I will be disappointed",

We were greeted by one of the owners and he was pleasant in every way! Went over their special and my husband decided to try the filet mignon with the mushroom sauce. I knew what I wanted to try prior to arriving and ordered the black squid ink pasta cooked in a saffron sauce and served with tiger shrimps!!!! My husbands dish was aahhhhhmazing! I think I ended up on his side of the table eating off his plate! The black squid ink pasta was also pretty darn good!!!   The owner even sent us home with some fresh uncooked pasta to take home and cook ourselves!!! What a wonderful experience! I definitely would love to come back for that filet mignon dish!",

He takes the time to chat with all of his guests to the point where, as a guest, you feel genuinely appreciated...like friend. The ambiance is perfect for family, dates, friends,  everyone and anyone.  It's casual but very tastefully classy. This is certainly becoming one of my regular spots.

We enjoyed being served by one of the owners who took extra time to welcome us and tell us about the restaurant (like they sell their pasta to various Strip locations). We started the meal with the tomato basil polenta - the marinara and cashews gave it a wonderful flavor. The Caesar salad was nothing great but is it ever?  The highlight of the dinner was the buttery, nutty goodness called Ravioli Bianca. A must get!  The Chicken Davida was also very tasty. It was as if chicken parm married eggplant parm.  The side of veggies were divine - as crazy as that sounds. So why not 5 stars?  The desserts - after such a fabulous meal we were hoping for more homemade goodness. Don't be swayed though- this place is definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "A few months ago we tried the Pasta Shop Ristorante for the first time and we liked it. Yes a bit pricey for what it is, but still a quality meal. Going back to the first visit my wife ordered the Calamari with pasta and for her it was one of the best dishes she has ever had and she isn't a real seafood lover, $32 but worth it. Today she had the pasta and scallops, but when I tired one of her scallops it was a bit too salty for my taste, but my wife didn't mind. Then I know it boring, but I like plain ole spaghetti and meatballs and it isn't on the menu. Today I did have the linguini and meatballs and it was good. I did have some odd shaped fork that was kind of round and short for some reason and it made pasta eating a chore. Overall a good place and good service, BUT the service isn't perfect. Waitresses are effective but not perfect. I wasn't offered any parmesean cheese at all, but I didn't really care one way or the other, but it should be offered. After the meal the tired looking dessert tray was presented, but no item per item description of what was being offered, just \"would you like some dessert?\" Overall it's quality food and wonderful homemade pasta. We'll be back to try the Calamari entree for my wife if it's available on the specials and I'll have whatever is close to spaghetti. Oh yes, we've never seen the owner or chef come out to the table. Also they do serve Peroni Italian beer, even though the window signs blaze Corona and Miller Lite.",

    "text": "Several previous enjoyable visits to the The Pasta Shop prompted three of us to make New Year's Eve reservations for an early dinner. The weather was quite cold and at 5 o'clock when the restaurant opened, we were seated directly in the path of the opening and closing door. We requested a change of table twice, but were refused because \"we have a lot of reservations tonight.\" A couple walked in, stated that they had no reservations, yet were promptly seated at one of the many vacant tables in the interior of the restaurant. Dinner was a choice between two fixed price menus. Of the limited choices from the unfestive menu, we opted for a Caprese appetizer, which was served without basil, because \"we are out of basil\" (although are three grocery stores within shouting distance of the Pasta Shop).  Rigatoni with sausage was drowning in tomato sauce, the brownish Caesar salad seemed to be dressed with balsamic vinegar, and the cannoli, the only choice of dessert on the $38 menu, was hard as a brick. The host for the evening, after seating us, never returned to the table and while the server was competent we felt quite unwelcome in general. No excuse for a small capacity restaurant with limited choices of a fixed price menu to produce such unsatisfying fare. This experience was in complete contrast to previous visits when the pasta was tender and tasty and the salads were ice cold and crisp. We left disappointed and most likely won't be returning.",

So when I eat out I look for quality and consistency, I prefer a small cozy friendly place where I feel really comfortable. The Pasta Shop has a great ambience and a warm and pleasant environment. Great artwork adorns the walls for an added twist on a modern bistro. You walk in and are immediately greeted by one of the owners. Very personable and quite friendly. Makes you feel right at home. The service is quick without rushing you and very pleasant. The food has a home cooked quality with fresh made pastas and fresh ingredients, all cooked to order. The menu is compact but rather unique and tempting. I love the clams and linguini with a rose sauce. The caesar salad and cheezy bread are a great compliment. In all a great dining experience and have been back often with consistently great food and great service. If you are looking for a small cozy quality Italian restaurant with great home style cooking the Pasta Shop will surely satisfy.",

There is artwork to look at while waiting but there is really no where to stand without feeling like you are in the way.  The kitchen must put a fair amount of heat into the dining area as it seemed hot. We had the live forever salad, chicken marsala and eggplant parmesan...cannoli and spumoni pie for dessert. We probably didn't need the salad appetizer since the dinners come with Caesar salad. I found the Chicken Marsala to be an interesting interpretation of a classic dish and the Eggplant Parmesan was okay. I imagine we will eat here again based upon food but ambiance is what it is.",

The pasta is perfectly cooked and sauced.   The linguini fra diavolo was good, but I would have liked a touch more spice. The teatro pasta was also good with a large amount of the thin cream sauce on it. The portions are also pretty good. I definitely left full.

Sausage add on was flavored nicely and had a good snap to the casing. Baked rigotoni in rose sauce was mind blowing. So good I had to pull myself away from it when I saw the waitress walk the dessert tray over to another table. Homemade tiramisu!! I just can't!!

It's a small place with a very quaint and artsy  decor (which is for sale by the way, as it has price tags on them).  Onto the food...I had the squid ink saffron shrimp pasta...now say that 10 times fast! The pasta is made fresh...yes fresh and you can definitely tell the difference! The sauce was a creamy sauce but just the right amount so as not to make one feel disgustingly bloated. There was a generous portion of large shrimps cooked perfectly (see picture under tips). If I could, ok I did!...I cleared off my dish!...and I will definitely be coming back for more!  So good we had to give the owner kuddos as it was surely due!",

Other Italian spots in the past have told us then don't eat at an Italian place if you don't like garlic... Rude! So THANK YOU Pasta Shop! =)  With an order of pasta... A salad and bread will arrive... Nice value with great pasta perfectly cooked with very nice taste.   I did order a greek salad and the BF ordered a tomato/mozz salad and both were swimming in dressing which is what leads me to 4 stars... They KILLED it with pasta and it's in their name and the most important part so don't let the salad deter you. NICE PART, I let them know and they asked if I just want a salad with no dressing... I explained I want a salad with dressing but a lot lighter then drenched (I'm talking soggy/limp drenched). They returned with a new one that was better!  The staff were all sweet and made you feel cozy... I really like the vibe there it's comfortable and welcoming!",

Also, the salad was clearly prepared ahead of time as some of it was rusty and the plates were ice cold.   I chose the 'linguine' with white clam. Too bad they served fettuccine. Fresh clams, but hardly a hint of garlic (and the hint was more raw than cooked), and although there were a good amount, they were so small it needs more (and a tiny fork to get them out of the shell). Again, no fresh ground pepper. One more thing, I like fresh ground reggiano parmigiana (I know, it's a sin with fish, but I like it)... None offered. Big fail.   Kim chose the chicken parm. Again, a total fail. The 'sauce'... Really? Crushed tomatoes, no seasoning. Boxed rigatoni, way under cooked. The chicken had a previously frozen texture. The parm was melted but totally missed the slightly golden color. Again, no fresh grated cheese or pepper.   Sad excuse for Italian",

Love that it's right here in our neighborhood! Come try or don't and we will be happy to enjoy it all for ourselves!!!!!!  We will be back for my birthday next year!  Thank you Annie and so fun to meet you and eat at your wonderful place.",

So friendly, wonderful atmosphere, best service, the most delicious food ever and they have great specials that can't be beat and you get a really good amount of food too!!   My latte was perfect with a rich taste and extra frothy just as it should be. Gourmet Italian cuisine in an intimate setting specializing in homemade Italian fare. They also have a wide selection of Italian wines. The waiter gave me some good suggestions on dishes and they pour a very generous glass of wine. The food was amazing-their salad dressing was light yet filling, and the pasta was great. The spinach linguini dish with shrimp was delicious. The size of the dishes was perfect too. The menu had the obligatory pasta dishes but then took off with deliciously marvelous departures from the ordinary. Each of the two of us had the same special--blissfully flavored and light ravioli with excellent chicken sausage and shrimp. A teasing of sauce and we were in heaven. Our server brought food items out one at a time so we didn't have a cluttered table, he was very prompt at taking our empty plates away and keeping water glasses full. For those seeking to off-strip, local options, this place is a winner.",

It's only a few minutes off the strip, and worth the drive.    Everything is fresh.  The Pasta is made \"In House\".   And the service is top notch.  The owners are always present, and the other staff members are like family.     Now about the food. AMAZING....!!!  The chefs recipes are perfect.  The taste on palate works.  The sauces are well represented with garlic, onion, tomato's, etc... They also have a spectacular Vegan menu.  The wine and beer options compliment their menu.  The deserts are homemade, or locally sourced and worth the purchase.    And the price...!!   It's not even close to what you would pay on the strip.   So again worth the drive.    And the owner is also an artist.  So most items in the restaurant is for sale.   Great concept.    Some of my favourite pasta's are: Ravioli Bianca, Pasta Anne, Mediterranean Sausage, chicken Marsala, Franks Favourite Meat Sauce, Linguine with Meatballs or Sausage!!!    Try it !!!",

And I do not mean that in a negative way.... Excellent wine list....even by the glass.....  We are locals who have lived here for 22 years.

    "text": "This has a more casual dining feel with a mix of contemporary art and Van Gogh likes is the best I could describe this place.  The main attraction is the home made pasta that is not flown in, not store bought, just simply made in-house.    The Caesar salad and ciabatta bread was complimentary with our meal and a nice way to start off the meal.  We ordered bruschetta as an appetizer that came with a healthy serving of tomato mixture and the olive tapenade.  Definitely on the pricier side of things, so I probably would only stop by on special occasions. We finally found some time to celebrate a birthday and it was a nice treat.  The spinach linguine with olive oil and garlic was my dish of choice.  The chicken was ever so lightly fluffed in flour and cooked to perfection.  The sun dried tomatoes with the hidden mozzarella cheese was a great balance to a non-red sauce dish.  No dry chicken in my dish, but I couldn't speak for my husband who thought his pappardelle and chicken was on the dry side.  The pasta are great, and I appreciate that the mere fact that it was just freshly made.  Our waiter was sweet and gave us two bags of pasta to-go when we mentioned our check-ins.  The fresh pasta came in handy for a quick pasta night at home.",

Our waitress was Shirley and she was very attentive and friendly.  I had the special of Filet with Pepper pappardelle with Marsala wine sauce, it was amazing.  My husband had the Franks Meat sauce which was also very pleasing.  The house Cab and Proseco (Astoria) were also pleasing. We decided to split a dessert and decided on the Pineapple Upside down cake with a Sea salt gelato, now I know that sounds strange at an Italian Restaurant but it was out of sight.  It was so buttery and not overly sweet. The Gelato was so nice and creamy, not too much sea salt.  So I totally recommend this place and will be going back when I visit again next month. I was leery to try this place because a family member said on a prior occasion their shrimp smelled fishy, I hope that was a one time incident.  My son said go for it because he thought it was great, so we did and I agree.  The place is not large so I suggest if you have a special occasion or a large party you call ahead and make reservations.",

Everything, even attention to the details like the custom made tables, salt pepper shakers and even the toilet seat in the bathroom was crazy cool!  The selections are limited for  lunch but I found a salad and entree I wanted to try; the Fresh Mozzarella and Plum Tomatoes for my salad and Rigatoni Primavera for my entree.   The mozz, tomatoes were fresh but way too much vinaigrette. You cant tell from the picture, but after you get thru the layer of mozz and tomatoes, the vinaigrette filled up the well of the bowl. So after eating 1/2 my salad the other 1/2 was drowning in the dressing  ...next time I'll request it on the side.     The rigatoni dish was alright. Again pasta and veggies cooked right, but olive oil doused over whole dish. There was a nice pool of it left at the bottom. I really like the garlicky taste though. Shrimp was kind of bland tasting and texture a little tough.    My server was pleasant and attentive enough, but as other parties started to come in, it was hard to get her attention after she closed my check. I wanted to purchase some of the custom made utensils and it took awhile to get her attention again.  Well so far it's obvious  I like the art gallery part of it more than the food part of it. I really want to rate this place four stars but the cuisine doesn't quite match up. So 3.5 stars for now.  I'll give the dinner time hours a try next time around since there are more dishes I would like to try on there.",

I enjoyed a squid ink home made pasta in a saffron cream sauce with 5 perfectly grilled shrimp.  The entree's come with a great Caeser Salad. Well selected wines by the glass and a killer Pineapple Upside down cake!! Service was  excellent.  Was very impressed with Bianca and Theresa.  Wonderful restaurant with wonderful employees.  Great restaurant to bring a date to. However I am married and didn't bring a date.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better Italian meals I've had out. Pasta Shop Ristorante is a little place, that could easily be passed if you're not looking for it. After some debating on a Saturday night we decided to try out this little hole in the wall after reading some positive Yelp reviews. The aroma of the food being cooked in this little joint was unbelievable. There wasn't hardly a table open. The ambiance is perfect for this place - custom art everywhere, lot's of color, and dimly lit to create a quaint, but romantic atmosphere.   But let's be honest, if the atmosphere is great and the food is bad we're not really interested, right? The food was great. My wife and I both went somewhat traditional. I ordered the Lasagna and she ordered the Eggplant Parmesan. Both had cheese melting over the sides, were piping hot, and absolutely delicious. The lasagna had the perfect amount of sauce, perfect amount of cheese, and the it tasted amazing. The parmesan cheese they give you at the table is as good as I've ever had at any Italian restaurant. It's individual pieces cut unevenly off a brick of cheese. Melts right over the pasta and makes it even more delicious. The eggplant parm was as good as my lasagna, and enough to feed two. I would consider ordering that myself next time we go.   The restaurant is moderately priced, but worth every penny. Service was great and it appeared that the manager/owner was working the night we were there and keeping close tabs on all the tables. Our drinks were never low, the waitress was friendly and attentive. All in all a great experience.  Looking forward to our next experience at Pasta Shop Ristorante. And don't forget to check in on Yelp on your phone for some free fresh pasta.",

The squid ink saffron shrimp pasta reminded me of Indian food (love it!). My husband had the chicken marsala, and I have to say it was the BEST I've had. Marsala flavor really came through, and the chicken was so tender. My son had the Frank's favorite pasta and I think it was the best of the night. My daughter had the Teatro. Yum! The salad and bread came out within 3 minutes of putting in our order, and the salad was dressed PERFECTLY. Portions of everything were very generous. Dessert? Yes please! The pineapple upside down cake was fab and the tofutti was good too. The real kicker was the sea salt caramel gelato that they served with the pineapple upside down cake. Delicious!   Service was perfect. The girls were super nice and very attentive.  This will be a regular spot for us! Can't wait to go back.",

Unfortunately, lasagna with ricotta is a huge turn-off and downer for me. A True lasagna should be brimming with a meaty Bolognese sauce and creamy bechamel mingling between translucent pasta layers. The sheets were in fact well executed, thin and plentiful but the loads of ricotta overshadowed the flavors of the dish and turned the whole thing into an Americanized mess. I had such high hopes and was so disappointed.  The linguine alle vongole was equally disappointing. The homemade linguine were excellent and perfectly al dente but several clams had excessive amounts of sand and grit, which is totally unacceptable in a professional kitchen. I mean come on guys, soak them in salt water for 30 minutes and then repeat the process 2-3 times. How hard is that? The sauce was bland, under seasoned, watery and flavorless. Cooking the clams with a touch more chili flakes and garlic would make a big difference. And adding more of that nice salty, starchy pasta water would thicken the sauce into a more creamy texture. And taste it!  Close but no cigar sadly.  Overall it was somewhat underwhelming. Maybe it's because we had such high expectations based on the reviews and reputation. Maybe we'll give it another try.  .",

Our server was friendly and efficient. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and the pasta being al dente, which is my preference. The entree portions are large enough for two people. The Homemade Cannoli was a mini version, but just the right size for one person after the salad and entree.  The wall art is an eclectic mix and provides great conversation. Although there were not many customers on this week day night at 6 PM, I hope they continue their longevity.",

Hendersonians must be easily impressed(if the positive reviews are to be believed). This place tries very hard to be quaint but is just an overpriced Fazolis type scam. Save your money and check out the ridiculous prices BEFORE dining at this place. Trust me, this place is a pass.",

I pulled up Yelp and found Pasta Shop in the Horizon Ridge area. It sounded pretty good. So I drove all the way to Horizon Ridge.  It's a small place on the corner of a strip type mall. It was a quiet area that looked fairly new.  A large party just finished dining. We were greeted and sat at a large table toward the back.   Drinks: *Moscato  *Peroni.   They were ok. Caesar salad was good. Bread was great.  We ordered a few appetizers.  *Brussel sprouts *Shrimp scampi *Artichoke  The Shrimp and Artichoke were great. Brussel sprouts were ok.  Dinner: *Evening special-Squid ink pasta with salmon, lobster chunks and creamy lobster sauce. Excellent! *Baked Rigatoni was ok  Dessert: *Spumoni ice-cream was good.  Overall: Very nice, quaint, family run business. The name is deceiving. The owner was friendly. The food was good. I would go back to try other pasta dishes.  *Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for free homemade pasta.",

It was LONG overdue.  The place has decor that reminds me of a coffee house I used to frequent in Mesa,AZ. The art is cool, fun and available. I like places that use locally sourced artists. In this case the artist is a part of the family.   It's a small location, but fun atmos  The pineapple upside down cake is incredible. You cannot stop eating. It is addictive.   Lots of frequent customers, so it can be hard to get in and served, because they are busy talking to the wait staff.   Very hip place. Cool vibe. Lovely, Friendly staff. Good hang. Good food.",

I had left over lasagna and enjoyed it for lunch the next day!   Food taste: B. I had the lasagna, and thought it was good, but not the best I've had in the valley. The pasta did taste very fresh. What I really loved about my meal was the Caesar salad. Omg was that salad amazing. And the cannoli---yum!  Ambiance: A. What a cute whole in the wall! Fun art on the wall and a comfortable place for a date night or family dinner.  Service: A. Really wonderful service.   Overall grade: B. Above average place with a great salad. The lasagna was good, but it didn't blow me a way. I had high expectations, and while I wasn't let down, I did expect more. I will give another entree a try when I return.",

They switch the pasta for her with no issues.  She loved the grill veggies in the primavera.    Dessert upside down pineapple cake was so good she didnt share.  I would say the bruschetta need some upgrading. Personally, I feel like I go bread w pico on the side.  Really they should make the crostini w the tomato ontop, bread need be little softer.  Olive tapenade was fine on the side.  But for the cost, i shouldn't have to do the work.  The artichoke was delicious never had it cold w balsamic  before.  I will get that again.    Eggplant was crispy and sauce was not overpowering.   Pasta was all dente just like mom used to make.  E very table was full, and really needed third person helping, it took time for drinks to be refilled, and the check to arrive but we were not in a hurry.  Definitely worth coming back here again.",

Plus the few times I've had something, I always got indigestion from the bitter sauce. And,  I can't justify going out to pay for pasta when I make my own at a portion of the cost. I mention this because I am VERY particular when it comes to eating Italian out.  I ordered the meatball sandwich, it comes open face over what I believe was homemade ciabatta bread. Let me tell you, the meatballs were just as good as my own!!!!!  The sauce was good too. I did not get any indigestion!!!! Oh my gosh all around yumminess!!! I will definitely have the meatball sandwich if we do work lunch here again. It was THAT good!!!!  It is pretty pricey but everything is homemade. You get much better quality with homemade and it definitively shows here.",

    "text": "Annie owns this place and she's there all the time making certain things are done just right and one of those things is the food.  This small local restaurant is not at all what I expected. I was looking for good Italian food to take out and when I reached the door 30 minutes before the opening time it was the owner who let me in.  Pleasantly surprised, I was seated, offered water if I'd like to wait and when I told her I was interested in a takeout order to bring food to a friend who just broke her foot, she told me it wouldn't be a problem - and it wasn't.  In fact, it was far from it.    She brought me a menu that I swear came from any of a number of Italian restaurants I frequented as a young man living in Brooklyn NY - southern Italian cuisine.  She recommended the Brussell sprouts sauteed and dressed in a delicious vinegarette with cashews - awesome. I couldn't decide on main dishes because the choices were sounded so good, but I settled on the Fra Diavolo (or Diablo - potato, potaato), with both shrimp and scallops.  A second was the Italian sausage pasta.  Home made cannoli and tiramisu topped off the meal along with garlic bread and a parmesan-ladened salad.  Wondering how this would keep with travel to my friends' house, we both were pleasantly surprised that nothing required heating and the tastes were all exquisitely complementary. This reasonably priced diamond in the rough should be on your 'place I need to go for Italian' list.  You won't be disappointed.  Thank you, Annie, I'll be back.",

The food was OK but not outstanding - and it was clearly overpriced.   A few weeks later we decided to give it another try. We arrived there around 8pm and the restaurant was already closed!?! While we were peeking inside to find out what's going on, somebody opened the door and told us that they closed early because the evening was slow. Hence, this didn't leave a good second impression on our second visit!  The third time we went there, we double checked first whether they were really open that evening. I ordered the black pasta and it tasted like cardboard. The bill was over $100 for 2 pasta dishes and one appetizer (no wine). Needless to say we won't come back: For that price tag the restaurant design should be nicer, the opening hours more reliable, the service more professional and the food a one of a kind pasta experience!  Post Scriptum: It's almost impossible to find a vegan option on the menu. Make sure you check their menu before you consider going there!",

The server was not very knowledgeable about the menu which is a little disconcerting if you have are trying to follow a plant based diet, and the person serving you does not know what ingredients are in the food.  My suggestion is for some training, I am okay when someone says \"I don't know\" buy not okay with an I don't care attitude.  Service aside could have earned one more star if the food was good, found it to be rather bland, and I ordered a spicy dish.",

We came in around 6 (so they began to get busy within a few moments of us being seated) and the service was still great. I believe the owner himself came out and bused our table and he was very sweet.  I can't remember the name of my dish other than it started with a \"T\" and had rose cream sauce....those left overs will be amazing tonight because my dish was too good to be True rich and creamy yum! My boyfriend got the ravioli and it was bland (not very much sauce or flavors I saw added, some tomato cut up on top) but he enjoyed it and said the inside and quality of fresh pasta was well worth ordering.

My husband and I are vegetarians and we can always find different things to order. The entire back page of the menu is a vegan menu, so there really is something here for everyone. My favorites are the Ravioli Bianca and the Teatro, which are creative and flavorful dishes. They also have classic Italian meals. They serve a delicious Caesar salad and cheesy ciabatta bread with every meal. They always have good wine, I had the Iconic Chardonnay last night and loved it. The restaurant itself is so interesting. The owner creates her own artwork and it is displayed throughout, which is always fun to look at. We have been here on nights where there is a live performer and the ambiance is awesome. We also love to come here for special occasions, especially because if you sign up with them, they send you a coupon for a discount and a free bag of pasta/cannoli on your birthday and anniversary. If you usually go to Olive Garden or anything similar, you will only spend a bit more here, but the difference is AMAZING. Pasta Shop Ristorante is the best!",

At the new location I do recommend reservations but we have always had good luck without as well. Always ask about the specials.. the salmon in lobster cream, cold artichoke and calamari are a few of my favorites. The marsala is one of my favorite \"regular\" menu items.

You call yourself a pasta shop, and don't have Angel Hair, Mostaccioli, Bow-Tie, and many other kinds of pastas?  The service was good until it was time to get the check.  For 2 people, they gave us one piece of bread, split into 6 of the smallest sections I have ever seen.  $16.95 for a little plate of Fettucine, whose watery sauce had a muenster cheese smell to it!  The caesars salad was good, but how can anyone mess up a salad?  It would have been a nice neighborhood find, but no thank you.  I'll go to Giada's down the street toward Anthem, and get some decent Italian food.  When you want or think of pasta, going to the Pasta Shop will be a disappointment as it is NOT their speciality.

Artichoke appetizer: cold artichoke is not always my favorite, but this is the best I've had. It was beautifully presented, and I love balsamic (theirs is homemade), so it was lovely.  Cheese bread: perfect cheese to bread ratio   Salads: I could have used more croutons and cheese, but it was an unexpected surprise to get salad as I didn't even realize it was included  Ravioli (we had both kinds): perfectly cooked with light sauces dressing them. We both preferred the one with red sauce over my Bianca.  Meatballs: crispy outside and juicy inside  Cannoli: outstanding! They make them in house and I would even bet they make their own whipped cream - this is not reddi whip.  The price point is a little high, but David (the owner) said they supply their home made pastas to many casinos, and I could absolutely see people paying more for it. This teacher's salary might be reluctant to come back, but when David presented us with some fresh pasta to take home, I was sold. I don't check in on yelp ever, so it was another pleasant surprise.   The service was impeccable (in spite of the fact that there was a 15-person party that was receiving their salads as we came in), and I'd rather pay a little more to a local business than give a cheaper Italian chain restaurant my money!",

    "text": "After having seen good things about this place around the internet & local magazines, I finally visited for the first time last week and was sadly disappointed; I was expecting and hoping to like it! I really wish their food was better, because this place is fairly close to my house and I'd otherwise be there all the time.  The space they have is small but welcoming, and I love the art they have hanging around (all of it is actually for sale). The owner and others working there were all very pleasant and service was pretty good. The menu, while not super extensive and a bit heavy on seafood offerings, had several intriguing offerings. Out of four of us, we ended up with 3 different dishes: rigatoni primavera, chicken davida (sauteed chicken topped with eggplant parm with a side of vegetables and a polenta cake), and my pick, the scallops fra-diablo (that's what they say instead of fra diavolo). Now, they're known for their home-made pasta, and in that respect I can say they didn't disappoint. The linguini (and accompanying sauce) in my scallops dish was pretty tasty, and held up well as next-day lunch leftovers. The scallops sort of brought the vibe down, though, as they turned out more rubbery than they should have been. The rigatoni primavera looked good, but I didn't end up trying that dish. I did taste a couple bites of both the chicken and the eggplant parm,and they were both nearly flavorless (how the heck do you get a fried food to lose its flavor?!). I was told, however, that the accompanying veggies were delicious. With your meal, you're given cheesy garlic bread (tasty enough, but could use more garlic) and starter Caesar salads (just ok, for a Caesar, which I normally enjoy; would have liked the option for a green/garden salad instead). The croutons on the salad are even better than the garlic bread, so don't skip eating those!  I'm hoping it was just an \"off\" night for the chef, because like I said, the place is super cute and I really wanted to like it. I'll re-visit at some point and test out a different dish or two, but I can't say my mouth will be watering in anticipation.",

    "text": "Worst Italian food I ever had!  1.  They did not even any Italian beer..(i.e. Peroni)  2.  Bread was not  even garlic and my wife described it as leftovers...was like oversize croutons all chopped the hell up.  3.  This place claims to make there own pasta and supply the local las vegas 4 star Italian restaurants with it....but why the hell did all they have was linguine & rigatoni style noodles to choose from?    4.  I got the linguine with meatballs and it was horrible.  The noodles tasted like they came out of a top ramen bag, overcooked, and bland taste.   The marinara sauce was runny and appeared to have come out of a can of campbell's tomato soup...no sign of fresh tomatoes or ingrediants.  5.  Wierd music playing...not even any type of typical opera or italian music that puts you in the mood for Italian food.  I don't even consider this a real Italian restaurant....after eating in Little Italy in San Francisco.  Please someone shut this joke of a restaurant down.",

There is no actual kids menu, but they were very accommodating for our little dining companions.  We normally wouldn't have tried a restaurant like this in a little plaza with high expectations.  But it was well worth the try.  We will absolutely be back.",

Small little place, which can be hard to find or easily missed if not paying attention. It appears to be run by a father and daughter who both attend tables, take orders, clean and apparently, the owner is also a painter! He has beautiful art work all around also available for purchase. I was blown away by some of his art! Super talented!  I ordered the Sausage Linguini and LOVED IT! The complimentary bread is also very fresh, home made and delish. Service was fast, however, a tad pricy. The picnic tables outside are awesome for a late night dinner. Definitely intend on visiting this place again.  P.S. Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a $10 for $20 deal!",

The art done by owners are a nice way to perk up this quaint restaurant that had a California coast like feel. The service and food are excellent. I definitely recommend their blanched artichoke appetizer, delicious smooth garlic flavor with a hit of the really good aged balsamic in a beautiful easy to eat presentation topped with flecks of Parmesan cheese. We ordered the linguini and clams and ravioli Blanca. The raviolis had a nice light caprese flavor with fresh basil, tomatoes and a crunch from the cashews ( will have to try adding that to my next homemade pasta recipe). The owner David was very attentive ...maybe a little TOO attentive & wonder if he would be so friendly to a hetero couple...also brought us a birthday cannoli and complementary bag of fresh black pepper pasta. They make fresh pasta for a lot of the restaurants on the strip. We will definitely be coming back here again.",

Nice and clean with low lighting and incredible smells of fresh Italian food.   My husband ordered pasta with meatball & sausage. Before his entree he got a caesar salad and fresh garlic cheese bread. The salad was nicely dressed and had big pieces of fresh pamesan cheese. The garlic cheese bread, soft, warm and cheesy.   Great presentation of the entree with FRESHLY made pasta.. Tender noodles topped with a flavorful tomato sauce with meatballs and sausage. Yes, it was my husbands dinner, but I did take a few bites and glad I did. I can't wait to go back and try something for myself. All the dishes coming out of the kitchen looked delicious..  Looking foward to trying the clams!   The service was fantastic! Both the owners who are brothers were both on hand. Very welcoming and friendly. Great place to go and to take company when they are in town for a great meal without having to get near the Strip!",

I had the fradiavolo with shrimp and I was disappointed by the sauce. I couldn't taste the sharpness of ripe tomatoes and the dish had no spice. Also, beware as the dishes are overpriced. The difference for my dish with shrimp vs. without shrimp was 24.95 and 17.95 respectively. I got 5 perfectly grilled shrimp. It is up to you how bad you want the shrimp. My husband had the chicken Alfredo, it wasn't flavorful enough either. It lacked either seasoning or more parm. For dessert, I tried the chocolate cake. It is a frozen cake and was good, although I prefer a warm cake. My husband had Oreo gelato bites, he loved them!! Call ahead and make a reservation as the space is small.",

It was only a matter of time before we returned to relive the experience and it was very, very disappointing.  I order the Ravioli Blanca with scallops, which come with a $15 price tag for the scallops. I am a huge seafood fan! To my horror, these where literally the worst scallops I have ever had! Disgusting. They were very overcooked and had a chemical taste. The worst. Needless to say I only had a small bite from each of the 3 hoping only one was bad. All were bad and my issue comes when the server clears my plate and obviously notices I didn't eat the scallops and just takes the plate away. A question at that point could have fixed my awful experience. Fail for service and food. My girlfriends spinach pasta with a garlic butter sauce was bland as well. I will never go back!",

As soon as you walk in the restaurant you get greeted by the aroma of homemade sauce being cooked!!!

This was not possible because the ambiance was not conducive to feeling upbeat.  You can actually be seated in the hallway by the restrooms.  About the food:  generally good except for the polenta which was dry and tasteless.  Finally, the art was not something to go for, very sixties, rough and amateur.

When we opened the bag we were sorely disappointed in the portions of the food and what we thought was \"missing\" pasta when in fact we called the restaurant we were told \"oh, no you ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer for $16.95.\" Whoa! More like shrimp \"skimpy\" my husband stated. 4 shrimp in sauce is hardly an appetizer. We've dined at other Italian places and this dish is always served with a pasta - whether spaghetti, linguine or fettuccine. So strange. Moving on, their side dish of Brussels sprouts for $8.95 is another joke because the veggies were soggy and overcooked, there were probably only 3 whole Brussels sprouts sliced up in sauce with cashews. The Caesar salad was decent portion but the romaine lettuce was so white you didn't think it was a salad. There was a small slice of garlic cheese bread to accompany the salad. Overall, for two people and $45 later, you'd think we'd be content or full...we ended up raiding our own pantry to supplement our hunger from the small portions and high price. I would no longer recommend this restaurant to clients, friends and family.",

He took a genuine interest in knowing about me and my partner. This is a hard experience to have in restaurants in the Las Vegas Area.  The food was amazing and before we left he gave us a baggie with homemade pasta to take home.   David since has passed away but his family has done an amazing job of keeping his legacy alive. I bring all my relatives and friends that come to visit to the Pasta Shop and no one has been disappointed. David's wife and children are as warm and friendly as he was. The food is still amazing!",

Of the three dishes I've had, the flavors of the sauces and toppings have been pleasantly subtle to showcase the house made pasta. I mean hello! It's a Pasta shop, not a sauce shop. The flavor and quality of the different types of pasta; spinach linguine, pepper papperdelle, and ravioli Bianca, are tasty pared with a good red wine. A small shop, is busy around dinner and I've not had to wait (at all or very long) to be sat.   There's a whole section for the plant based people of the vegan variety, live music on the weekends, funky art to admire.",

I was amazed at the location, it's  it not too far from my house and it's actually on my way to church... so double win win! The parking is not a problem and there is plenty of it. I was really impressed with the Decor of the restaurant, and I asked the waitress about the theme and said it's a family owned business and the Mother/wife does all the art work- (support your local artist) One of my favorite things about Pasta is the actual Pasta it's self. The pasta is all homemade and cooked perfectly Al la dente!  Don't forget to check in for your free bag of pasta, I can't wait to try to create a dish at home for my kiddo.  I also like that the restaurant has a Vegan selection, I can take my Best Friend to eat here and not feel guilty I dragged her to a place that only serves salad, they have a really good selection. All the salads and dishes look good and I can't wait to try more dishes.",

    "text": "The catch with Pasta Shop is the food is created by a chef with Strip experience inside a restaurant that doubles as an art gallery which provides a unique and intimate environment. If you're not a fan of fresh, house made pasta then something is wrong. But that's what you'll find here along with a welcoming and attentive staff.  The restaurants is literally under Lindo Michoacan sitting on the lower level of the same hill on the southwest corner of Horizon Ridge and Carnegie. Our party of 5 arrived around 6 PM without reservation and we were able to sit immediately in a round in the middle of the restaurant. The interesting artwork and decor will definitely catch your eye when you have a second to look around. We were greeted immediately and given the dinner specials for the night. Service was more than adequate for the entire meal.  The dinner menu is centered around  \"creative specialties\" and \"classics\" all made with pastas that are made in house. Even with all of the entrees coming with a complimentary Caesar salad and garlic cheesy bread, the prices are a touch inflated. We skipped appetizers and ordered entrees that came out in a timely manner. Everyone was pleased with their pasta dishes which included linguine & clams, two pappardelle alfredo with chicken, and ravioli bianca. I was least satisfied with my salmon and lobster special for the night. The salmon was cooked over and salty and the lobster was pretty much non existent with only one bite sized piece. I definitely did not get value with the $30+ price tag for my entree.  We also skipped on dessert with our bill, without appetizer and dessert, coming to $155 before tip. We also received a bag of fresh pasta with check in which turned out to be a great meal later in the week. I think this would be a great place to take a date for a unique experience. Next time, we would leave the younger ones at home and I would make their chicken alfredo myself instead of paying $20 for each entree. I would also make sure we order from the \"creative specialties\" section to have something unique.",

But hey, you get what you pay for! Made from scratch! Maybe add more clams? I love the pappardelle pasta, and also the artichoke appetizer. Downer- $6 for a tiny scoop of gelato??!

The pasta is all homemade and the yelp special (1 lb of fresh pasta to take home for free on your first visit) is awesome.  The baked ziti was great and you could tell the chef made it with love!

He was attentive and seemed very interested in my phone call. - Food server who helped me with my order was also very friendly and kind. - The only reason why I would go back is because service was awesome.  Maybe the cook just wasn't happy that night.",

That kind of customer service is something I can truly appreciate. Plus the food is excellent, something to write home about forsure. Honestly, I dream about it. I get the ravioli Bianca every time. It's freshly made ravioli with brown sugar butter sauce and grilled tomatoes and pistachios. They bring fresh garlic bread to the table and Caesar salad with every meal. My husband has tried a few different things but he's obsessed with the saffron shrimp saute. It's black squid pasta with tiger shrimp and saffron sauce. Everyone is really nice there. My bank account doesn't like it there but too bad. Oh and desert, don't pass it up. Live like a fatty here, trust me. Ps- check in on yelp and get a free bag of pasta. I always forget to redeem my offer.",

I've had just about everything on their menu and to say it's good food would be an understatement. My favorite is the Clams Linguine, mostly because they use fresh clams and not the canned stuff like a lot of other Italian restaurants. All of the portions are just the right amount and the food is well balanced. No overpowering flavors what so ever. And one of the best Caesar salads I've had in Vegas yet!  To me, the decor is refreshing. Little art trinkets and pieces throughout the shop that are for sale and give it a unique feel. There isn't much of a view of the strip from the restaurant due to homes in the area, but go to the parking lot just above the restaurant and you have an incredible view of the city.",

I saw that the Pasta Shop Ristorante had excellent reviews so I made a reservation. We were not disappointed. Not only was the food amazingly good, so was the service. They serve classic dishes with home made pasta. Caesars Salad is included with every entree. My wife had the Ravioli Bianca and I had the Chicken Parmesan. My wife especially love the pistachios in her dish. We started the meal with an artichoke appetizer that was not only visually stunning but incredibly delicious.   The owner, David, greeted us and introduced himself...made us feel welcome in his establishment.  It was very special treatment and he was the same way with all the other customers. As we were finishing our meal, David spent some time with us after bringing my wife a birthday desert on the house. He then gave me a pound of fresh home made pasta.   This is now one of our favorite restaurants and we will be returning often including tonight (Valentine's Day).  Even if you don't live in Green Valley, it's worth the drive. I suggest making reservations as seating is limited.",

At first glance I enjoyed the atmosphere-cool that they sell art too- it is a smaller place but we were seated immediately. I had the cheese ravioli with butter sauce which came with a side salad and bread. I thought everything tasted good and fresh but it wasn't worth the money...found out later it was $4 extra when I added a little bit of zucchini. I'm all for spending money on quality food but the food was just not as good as I anticipated...maybe I didn't pick a spectacular entree. The service was very good. I would say go and try it out and see what you think, it's worth it for sure! But I may go back to try another dish that was recommended.",

I had been wanting to check it out but from what I could peruse on the menu online, it seemed, ahem, a bit beyond my normal dinner price range.  The restaurant had a really great, four-course prix fixe menu for $30 during Restaurant Week.  That included an appetizer (polenta), salad (caesar), main course (rigatoni primevera with roasted cashews) and dessert (tiramisu).   I have high standards for Italian food as I spent some time in Italy during college and was spoiled with great food there.  (Ahhhhhhh, gnocchi in Roma.)  The Pasta Shop did not disappoint.  The starter and salad were good but the pasta was DELICIOUS.  While I like the occasional visit to the Macaroni Grill, I find that pasta at big chains tend to be drenched in sauce (among other things).  Here, the pasta was al dente and tasted really flavorful with just the right oils and spices; no additional compensation necessary!  It's also hand made fresh at the restaurant.  Hands down, some of the best pasta I've had in the US since my time in Italia.  The tiramisu was also heavenly.  Sometimes tiramisu can be too dry or taste too alcohol-y.  Here, it was just spongy goodness.  We also had the spumoni cake and that was equally delicious.  Hello, coconut shavings on the edge of the slice!    Next time, I may skip the salad and get down to business with the pasta and dessert.  Simply put, this place deserves a visit!!!",

You can really taste the difference with their freshly made pasta. I loved that each entree is served with a caesar salad and garlic bread. I tried the ravioli bianca and a special lobster ravioli the two times I've dined here. Both were amazing and huge positions. Even with how full my boyfriend and I were we've tried the canoli, white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the tiramisu (no judgment we had help haha). All three were amazing but the canoli won in my book. The owner came out and talked to my family and I after our meal which was really nice. You've got to try this place it is a rare find and definitely worth a trip!",

Pasta Shop you have changed since Tropicana.   Menu is worse, food is horrible and service is inconsistent.  We were never told the specials and the table that sat down as we finished were told all about the specials.  The server kept giving vague and odd answers that showed she didn't know anything.  The sauce for the pasta and eggplant parm were way over spicy. The meatballs you gave us in exchange had the same sauce. We paid over 40 dollars to leave hungry. Even my son's spaghetti and meatballs were over cooked.  You used to have creative and very good quality dishes. What happened?  Did you even taste the sauce after or just act like we were making the entire thing up?  Very bad overall to what used to be one of my favorite restaurants in town. Do not eat here.  Between the decor, service and quality of food it reminded me of something out of  Kitchen Nightmares.",

There were several dishes to choose from, Fa Diablo Shrimp, Tiger, Shrimp Primavera, one I can't remember lol and last but not least Salmon with lobster ravioli, in a lobster sauce. I chose the Salmon and it was Fantastic!!!  The Caesar salad there is nice and light. Not too fishy. The Salmon it's self was cooked to perfection, that paired with the lobster sauce had a wonderful flavor. The lobster raviolis were perfect. My boyfriend got the fettuccine Alfredo and added shrimp. The shrimp was huge, and really tender, and of course the pasta was yummy. For desert we got the cookies and cream tartufo, which I'm not going to lie I had no idea what that was when I ordered it but I'm so glad I did. It was so good. Cookies and cream gelato rolled in more cookies with chocolate.  Amazing!!!! Once again a spectacular meal. Thank you so much for making date night special.",

    "text": "Average, in the modern mediocre sense.  We were (still) looking for a new italian restaurant close by, our old favorite having disappeared a few years back. While driving along, I found this place on Yelp.  My only rule for restaurants, especially Italian, is I do not want a food factory. None of the chains for me. There too much room and too much talent in this town to waste time eating in a chain.  We went in and found a strange mixture of modern metal art and bright bud and miller beer signs. Not bad. Not great. Just average.  We were greeted by, I will assume, one of the owners. A pleasant enough fellow. He, nor any of the staff ever introduced themselves. An anonymous group serving us dinner. For the rest of the service we got the bare minimum of interaction. Drink order taken and served. Food order taken. Salad served. Dinner served. Dessert menu and check. Average. Mediocre.  I am usually a two drink during dinner guy. My beer ran out and no one ever noticed. I didn't bother to do their job as hosts and ask for more.  On to the food. A fantastic plate of, well, average. There was nothing wrong with the food. Chicken was well prepared and cooked. The raviolis were still al dente, properly drained and served. The marinara sauce is the only thing to find fault. Tomato sauce you could safely serve your entire family without complaint for too much salt, pepper, oregano, or spice. A flavourless endeavour. Overall my impression was that the chef has lost his passion for food and is phoning it in. Uninspired average fare.   Pricing is where I have issue. Two people with one drink each came out to $30 per person. For what it was, its overpriced. $20 per person is appropriate.  Would I eat here again? Yes, if someone else invited me and bought dinner.  Three nice average stars for this place. No hard feelings but the hunt is still on.",
