    "text": "I had high hopes for this establishment, especially since there were so many good reviews on yelp. So here goes my review:  Food: didn't get to try the food. When it comes to coffee shops, I strictly stick with coffee. On this particular day it was pretty warm out so I wanted a cold drink. I was super excited that this place offered almond milk so of course I had to go with it. Their menu is short and to the point. I ended up ordering a flavored latte with almond milk. Unfortunately my drink ended up being so sweet I couldn't even drink half of it. The taste of the coffee didn't really compliment it either. Wasn't too impressed with the drink in the end.   Ambiance: LOVED the decor of this place. There's so much lounge seating, cool and modern art, and even books and games to entertain yourself with! Also, there's a television but it was turned off when we were there. I'm really digging the Star Wars vibe going on here.  Service: service was alright, nothing really memorable. The guy at the register neither ignored us or helped us. Since it was our first visit there he could've been more attentive.   Tips: My rating went mostly towards the shop itself. It seems like a cool place to hang out and chill with friends. I'm not a big fan of their drinks and I think I'd rather go elsewhere to enjoy a cup of coffee.",

They use locally sourced beans roasted in nearby Boulder City and the staff are super friendly and knowledgable about their product. Try them out if you're ever in Vegas. Besides, the name of this place totally rocks it :)",

As for the shop itself there is plenty of space to sit (especially since they've expanded), games to play, and amazing murals/individual pieces to admire or even purchase. Their caffeine and canvas events with Tommy are so much fun! I can't say anything bad about this place, and I'm so excited for the new location. Keep up the amazing work. GJ Nation for life!",

Everything here is all about the locals and I love it. I never fail to come here before work, after work, sometimes gotta drink a coffee before bed. The interior feels so homey and is super colorful, but most of the time I do go through the drive-thru (which is open 24/7), and later in the night a barista, Randi, always helps me out and is super sweet! She never messes up my order and is super quick and we always have a nice little convo. If you come to vegas, or if you live here, TRY THIS PLACE OUT!",

    "text": "Great coffee shop in this side of town! My boyfriend and I would drive by this place from time to time and we finally decided to give it a try since I was in dire need of an afternoon pick-me-upper. Walking in, we were immediately greeted by the friendly baristas. We were also amazed how quaint and hip this coffee shop is with tons of books, board games, Star Wars stuff, and local art/comic decor. From the outside, it looked like a small coffee shop but once you walk in, it is pretty spacious with plenty of tables in the front and a large separate room in the back. As for their menu, they have a huge variety of drinks and food to choose from including smoothies, teas, classic/specialty coffees, pastries, and breakfast items. I had a hard time deciding what to get at first because everything looked and sounded good. I ended up ordering a hot mint mocha with non fat milk and I loved it. It had a hint of sweetness from the dark chocolate/mint and a perfect amount of bitterness from the coffee. My boyfriend ordered an iced honey with soy milk, which he liked, but not as much as me since he's not too fond of the bitterness taste from the coffee. Overall, it's definitely an excellent place to stop by and get quality coffee and great customer service. We'll be back for sure to try their other drinks on the menu.",

Their customer service is top notch, everyone is so friendly and once in awhile they go around to check on everyone to see if anyone wants a cup of water or a free donut :) If you just want to hang out, there's a whole bunch of books and board games that you can borrow, plus free wifi.  The coffee is really smooth. And if you're like me, who likes sweet but not too sweet coffee, I suggest getting \"Grouchy John Frappe or Latte\" it has white chocolate and amaretto (almond flavored). If coffee isn't your thing, they also got smoothies and teas.   Over all this place is great! Clean, friendly, and laid back environment. Be prepared to forget about Starbucks.",

The staff is super friendly and even remembers me when I go in - something that is incredible considering how much business they get!  I also love that they participate in community events.

It's parked out front, outside of their coffee shop. There are so many people in here, you can tell they have their fans. I am definitely one of them and will be back again and again!",

I walked in and the atmosphere was fun and inviting, I was greeted in a timely manner, I ordered the bulletproof which is coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oil, so delicious. Not a bad price for what you're getting ($6.50 $6.75 can't remember.) I hate Starbucks and all their coffee flavored sugar drinks, so I was super stoked to find this little coffee shop. Although I don't live here anymore (born and raised in LV) i visit often so I'm going to make a point to visit this coffee shop at least once every time I visit.",

Close to $30 later I got two coffees and some bland sandwiches. I can make better bagel sandwiches which I often do and will be doing for now on lol.

The music in the background isn't distracting;not too many people here, and the atmosphere is fun with all the quirky paintings and toys placed everywhere. They have tables and leather chairs/sofas to increase your comfort while you stay. I definitely recommend",

Then I ordered and was even happier: $2 for my iced coffee! Talk about sticker shock--in a good way. The iced coffee was great and the price was perfect. I hope I'll stumble on this truck again on future mornings.",

Coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is local and awesome. You can get all types of interesting coffees, like cookie coffee and pb&j coffee... I don't even know!!!!   Place is awesome, chill, and what Vegas has been missing. Come by and check it out. I don't know if I will ever go to Starbucks again, and I love Starbucks atmosphere.

No one can touch the old socially open 'underground meets hipster' vibe of the old Roma and Copioh hangouts, but Grouchy John's will get you closer than any other Vegas coffee spot will. They have a ton of seating in the back room, while the more limited front of house seating provides a socially accessible setting. They have a ton of books, games and art to look at while you're there. The coffee is cheap and good, but the food is not cheap: It's a lot to pay for decent but basic food options. Still, for coffee it's a neat spot to see a variety of locals and art.",

About the place, it's def a place to hang out. It's super nerdy and cute. Star Wars, Walking Dead, a bunch of local artists, etc. are represented on their walls. They even have another room to where people can study or hang out. Play board games or enjoy your drink. They do have a coffee and paint night. I've always wanted to try it out, but never got the chance to. Looks fun!",

Much appreciation for decorating a section of the shop for that cult following.  They have a great selection of coffees, my favorites are; Hot: Curious George, Almond Roca Mocha Latte and Grouchy Johns Latte Cold: The Yoda and the Lando  The employees provide great service and are exceptionally kind, wonderful people.

When your in the shop, staff will actually check on you to make sure your drinks and eats are to your liking or even if you'd like a glass of water. I personally haven't seen a counter service type place treat their customers this way. Which is what puts them ahead of the rest! On FaceBook, they are funny to follow! From Geoff the gnome to Flag Salute guy and even encouraging baby Gracie. If they have a new drink coming out they will give you the details and ask for suggestions on a name. At Halloween time they have a vote for a costume for JJ to wear!  Such a cool place!! I just wish it was on my route more often so I can support them more! :)",

That being said, lots of my family and friends love it and that's why I found myself at Grouchy John's Coffee. An out of town friend scouted this place out on yelp because they had all kinds of board games to play and that's literally the one reason why we ended up all the way down in the bowels of Henderson! So the coffee: It was black and hot. That's all I really care about. But this place really did hit it out of the park when it come to having a huge selection of board games available for play. We ended up playing backgammon and chess but they must've had about 50 other games to pick from. There weren't any pieces missing and we had a grand ole' time playing and conversing. Oh yeah, we drank our coffee too. I'll never be back to this place unless said friend comes back to town and needs to play board games while consuming coffee but if that happens, Grouchy John's is where I'll go!  ps I'm still bummed that The Beat downtown closed. That was my old go to.",

But it's usually hot outside and not feeling coffee.  I love the artwork which is for sale.  I wonder if I can put my art work up too.  I like this place if you CHECK-IN you get an extra star stamp on your drink card if you buy a drink. Sweet only a few more then I get something free I think.  They have board games to play and books to read and seems like a pretty cool environment. They even have free WIFI  The first time I was here I needed to wake up a little and could've used a good coffee drink. Instead I noticed that they make something cool and because it was once again 100+ outside in Vegas during the summer I had to get some cold.  Went with the Strawberry Banana Smoothie with whipped cream on top which was delicious. They were fast at making it.   The customer service was great and friendly, I enjoyed the environment.  I came back again cause I really needed something to wake me up and it was COLD outside.  WHY CAN\"T IT JUST BE 75 DEGREES YEAR ROUND WHHHYYY. NM. LOL.  I'm no expert coffee drinker or orderer but I do drink coffee enough to say Grouchy John's Coffee pretty damn good. Plus you can't go wrong with extra stamp per drink with yelp app check-in.",

Things I like about Grouchy John's: Love the name, love the fact that they're not a corporate chain. The employees are friendly and appear to enjoy their job.  What I didn't like was the coffee that we ordered and the lack of seating. My babygirl's soy latte was piping HOT! Almost as hot as my Americano. The flavor wasn't bad, although temperature control would be a useful lesson around here. My Americano on the other hand was good and well made. I would order that again in a heartbeat.   As for the seating, there was a good amount, but they were busy. Can't blame a place for being popular. There are a few outside tables but who wants to drink coffee in the desert heat?  The interior appears to be a redecorated Starbucks. With lots of reading material on the shelves, it has that local coffee shop flair. They have a drive-thru window which furthers the former S'bux impression.  I applaud them for not being just another chain, however their drink menu is pretty much similar with a host of sugary frapps and just barely considered coffee drinks. No V3gan pastries on display either. So it's basically the same thing to me. The reason Starbucks is successful is consistency. I can get a tall soy latte from any ol' S'bux and it'll taste pretty much similar no matter where I am.   If I were local to Vegas, I would consider visiting here more often. Perhaps it would grow on me. Then again, Sunrise Coffee is vastly superior in ever facet, so I doubt even the frequent buyer punch card offered here would lure me back for more.",

    "text": "Absolutely A-1 coffee shop! Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as well as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is fast, attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, great staff, & just an overall awesome coffee shop! The flavor of the coffee alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there isn't one a little closer to where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely worth your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!",

    "text": "OK. So, this is my VERY FIRST review from my VERY FIRST business that I looked up on YELP! I am very pleased with the results! Although this shop is a little out of the way from where I live, it surely lives up to the expectations that were illustrated on YELP. First of all, I have children and it is impossible to find a place that accepts them that doesn't include large kid sized hamster tunnels with the smell of grease permeating everywhere that I breathe! I am a stay at home momtrepreneur that relies on an internet connection and distractions for my kiddos. When I walked in, I was happy to see 2 other moms with laptops and kids in tow sitting on the comfy couches that dot the lobby of this quiet yet creatively decorated coffee shop. The theme of Star Wars all over the place drew my boy's attention and has so far given me enough time to write this review (why I am procrastinating on my work is partly due to the extreme interest my kiddos have to their surroundings and how easy it is for them to behave here, I am surprised) . The staff was not only helpful but they didn't make me feel out of place. I came in lugging kids and a laptop along with a backpack and no clue what I wanted. They were patient and educational. Thanks guys for the amazing opportunity to get work done, drink this fantastic drink, (that I wished I would have paid closer attention to when ordering so I could get it again) and thanks once again for not judging who I was when I walked in with my troops and just accepted my as a possible loyal customer... which in fact, I will be returning (partly due to the punch card that I can't wait to fill so I can get my free drink ;) ! )",

I must say that Grouchy John's has the best coffee I have had in Las Vegas- and perhaps- of all time.  These guys know how to make EXCELLENT, authentic coffee.  Everywhere I go, my standard order is usually a triple short breve with a sugar.  I have even gone to that hipster Emergency Arts coffee shop in the Arts District (Fremont), anticipating that the coffee would be like it is in a major urban area.  Not at all.  TERRIBLE.  I have even driven all of the way over to Sambalatte in Summerlin.  PRETTY GOOD.  However, when I get my breve with one sugar from Grouchy John's and I take the first sip...HOLY MOMENT.  This place is the reason why some people stop doing drugs and start drinking coffee.",

In fact their stamp card program is probably the best and most generous I've seen from a Vegas coffee shop.  Now the best thing about this place: the hang.

I work one of my jobs from home, so having the opportunity to get out of my bed that has my body permanently imprinted in it from laying in it with my laptop within typing range is perfect.  Most recently I went at like 8am on a Sunday. I try to avoid going all the way back out to my house whenever possible, so I had a couple hours to kill between an airport run and a yoga class. I was a wee bit hungry so I bought something called \"ManBakes\" which I guess are a local product with a really unfortunate name. ManBakes sounds disgusting, and not just in an anatomical sense, but also in a sexist sense. MANBAKES? Come on. Gross. Whatever though, that's not the task at hand.  What's awesome about this place is that when you're inside, you forget that it's perma-summer. I come from a land of four seasons, and this \"Hades April-September\" and \"Light Autumn September-April\"  business of Vegas doesn't quite do it for me, but I feel like when I'm in Grouchy J's I could look up from my computer and see snow falling on the ground, or blossoms forming on trees, or something whatever.   Staff is also super friendly and gives you two stamps without proving you checked in on Yelp. Their straight-up drip coffee is fantastic, as well as their other foo-foo drinks that I like to have when I want to Noneify a workout.",

The menu has something for all preferences and tastes, the store is playful & fun, and the service is top notch.  Continuing my LV independent coffee shop adventure, my husband and I headed to Grouchy John's Saturday morning.   Everything about this place was \"just right\". The store feels modern & contemporary but also relaxed and unpretentious. The menu was large but not overwhelming. Plus there are coffee & non-coffee confections that would make Willy Wonka blush! My husband had the Grouchy John Latte which combined white chocolate & amaretto. Grouchy John himself  (i think) helped me out with my selection. He picked an off menu item called Serenity... white chocolate, peppermint and topped with whip cream & caramel (i skipped out on the toppings though - didn't want a cavity before breakfast). My husband also tried their blueberry muffin, banana nut muffin, and a glazed donut (seriously, he did) and he absolutely loved every bite (blueberry was his favorite).  Other than the good coffee, I feel the most notable part of my experience was I felt like I was in a friend's living room. Yes other places also have books and boardgames, but the vibe here definitely felt very home-y. That's quite a feat for first-timers.  I wish I lived closer but I'm already planning a trip back with friends next weekend for another round of Sopranos Trivia (I rule).",

Once you get past all that, their coffee is pretty damn good too! They use local and organic coffee beans for coffee roasters in Boulder City. They have all kinds of crazy, delicious specialty lattes, local pastries and even have an area with local business cards around the city. What more could you ask for?! I love coming here knowing I am not just giving yet another major corporation money. They welcome you back every time and try to remember your drink. I haven't even mentioned how awesome it is inside their cafe. Please just do yourself a favor and go check it out. You'll definitely be visit again!",

    "text": "The prophecy is True. The grouchy man has risen from the wasteland to save us from the evils of bad coffee. That's basically what his twitter profile says anyway.  I visited Grouchy John this morning while he was parked in front of Slidin Thru HQ. At the truck with John was JJ, the author of Bloodsucking Vegas. I thought he looked familiar. With today's secret word, I was able to get a Caramel Mocha Latte and a Chai Tea Latte. Double fisted gourmet coffee FTW! I don't get coffee often, so it was a good way to sample the grouchy man's menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the Caramel Mocha. It was uber-sweet and would satisfy any sweet tooth. On the flip side, the Chai was much milder.  Like I said, I don't get a lot of coffee. To me, there is simply good and bad coffee. On that simple pass-fail scale, Grouchy John's certainly serves up some good cups of Joe. At $3 for the Chai Tea and $3.50 for the Caramel Mocha (both 12oz cups), the prices are on the upper end. Still, I'm a fan. In the increasingly crowded Vegas street vendor scene, I hope he does well. Time will tell.",

    "text": "Not as Grouchy as they want you to think, Grouchy John's has some damn fine coffee with a great atmosphere. As the photos show, the inside is bright and colorful; it's a really nice change from the typically muted look of most coffee shops. There's plenty of pop culture related (mostly sci-fi, but especially Star Wars) art adorning the walls. Again, a nice break from what you see at a lot of coffee shops in Vegas. If you're a nerd like me, you'll probably get an extra kick out of it. They have a TON of books and board games, there's a TV with the news on (it's muted and closed caption). It's not too noisy in here so you can get work done pretty easily if you feel like it, but it's also laid back enough to hang out with some friends, split a tasty pastry and play a game.  I haven't tried any of their more unique drinks yet but I can tell you they make a mean dirty chai latte. I usually get it with almond milk. Their regular coffee is great, and so is the espresso (I guess that's obvious, since it'd be hard to make a mean dirty chai without some equally mean espresso). The presentation of the drinks isn't anything fancy, but I've never given much of a damn what the cup looks like, especially when the coffee is good.  There's also free wi-fi, friendly service... basically, I think it's my current favorite coffee shop and I feel like I should go more frequently.",

Everyone is super friendly and they even gave me a punch card.  If you check in on Yelp, you get double stamps.    Also, the coffee is quite expensive.  A mocha is about $1 more than at DD and much smaller.",

    "text": "One of the best coffee shops that I've ever been to, by far. Why? Its not just the product (which is pretty good) with Grouchy John's many coffee blends, pastries and other snacks. Its not just in the amount of space it has (front area can hold around 30 people, while the back room area can hold double that). And of course, its not just about its proximity from the Las Vegas Strip (5-7 minutes, depends how fast you are driving).   For me, Grouchy John's is all about the spirit of its employees and patrons. This coffee shop is like one living, breathing organism that takes after its owner- one enthusiastic, professional yet sassy & pissed off mofo that wants to show you who's your daddy when it comes down to exceptional coffee & good quality customer service. And even if you don't even drink a coffee, you'll feel a pretty good vibe here that will make you want to stay here a while and spend a few dollars more. This is such a place!  Seeing Grouchy John himself (usually wearing a Brooklyn hat with a small scowl on his face) can be slightly intimidating at first, yet when you see how he takes care of his customers, you'll get an impression that he truly cares about you in addition to the brand. I tried a recommended iced coffee blend that was so strong that I took the first sip at 9 AM in the morning in Vegas, and the last sip at 9 PM in Denver, CO after driving all day completely amped up from the amount of caffeine. And all for a few bucks. Now if that's not good coffee, I don't know what it is!  Grouchy John's is now one of my go-to places when in Vegas. Come get some!",

There are lots of books and such to keep you busy while drinking your coffee.   The coffee selection is also pretty eclectic but this didn't stop it from being pretty good.  The \"OG\" was pretty delicious if not a little too sweet.   All on all, if in this area again I'd definitely give it another try.",

The folks who run this place are undoubtedly Star Wars fans (see photos)...not sure what that's all about, but the Storm Trooper, AT-AT Walker, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo art peppered all over the place was pretty cool. Props.  The chairs and couch in the front room near the counter were nice and comfy. The larger side room seemed more suitable for work or studying with more outlets, tables, chairs, good lighting, and separation from the front counter noise.  Our breakfast sandwich was tasty and filling (see photo). Our beverages were delicious and of far superior quality than that of large coffee chains. The drip coffee did not taste burnt and they had medium and light roast choices. They had several dairy alternatives from which to choose for those of us whose bodies reject cow excretions.  For those who enjoy a great cuppa joe or the vibe of a good coffee shop, Grouchy John's will not disappoint.",

I don't often go for fancy beverages but one of the specials sounded great.  The girl asked how I wanted it, which confused me so I asked \"do you mean like with milk and sugar?\" In a condescending tone she said \"no,how do you want it?\"  After a couple back and forth like this she finally said \"hot or iced?\"  I figured it being a winter drink it would be hot and didn't know iced was an option (they have a ton of options-overwhelming). Not once did she crack a smile or exhibit any type of patience.  She certainly got the\"grouchy\" part of the name down!    Fun interior but the customer service would have made me uncomfortable to stay. I apologize for not being a skinny-latte-with-soy-milk-no-foam or whatever the hell people order type of person!",

The almond roca mocha was way too sweet for me, and I think it also has amaretto in it which I am not a huge fan of. All the syrup drowned out the espresso flavor, which was a bummer. I would definitely ask for less syrup in this one. My boyfriend's suicide smoothie (peach, mango, strawberry) was okay but nothing amazing.   Our barista was pleasant. If I come back again, I'll try either the butterbeer or a more traditional espresso beverage for a better coffee experience.",

I also like how my coffee didn't have that strong burnt taste that Starbucks coffees have. $3.68 for a large iced coffee with flavoring is an amazing price! They also have a stamp card program and if you check in on yelp, fb, or four square you get an extra stamp. How sweet is that? I will definitely come back here again. I might have found my new favorite coffee joint. I'll also make sure to bring my dog through the drive thru again because she sure enjoyed the treat.",

It didn't taste super syrupy like some lattes tend to be. The drip was pretty good... once it cooled down. When I got it, it was burning hot and tasted a little bit like the beans were burnt in the process. Once it cooled down, the burnt tasted went away.

It's a small group of baristas that are amongst the friendliest and nicest you will encounter in any type of customer service role. They remember their regulars and always have a happy demeanor, even if the shop is insanely busy. Oh! They make great coffee too.  The menu has all the typical coffee shop norms. I especially like some of their more creative flavor combinations like \"The Sith\" which is mocha and peppermint, or the \"PBJ\" which includes REAL peanut butter along with banana flavorings. They also have some food options including healthy wraps, and the normal pastry selection that is to be expected.  Decor is nice and inviting. This place is huge in the Vegas tech scene. You'll often find developers working hard on their Mac's, while some film guys discuss their latest project they're working on. They have a ton of books and games that you can grab up and enjoy, as well as a tv playing something geeky on the AppleTV. Plenty of comfy seating.  If you're looking for good coffee, great service, and a cool place to hang out that ISN'T regurgitated Starbucks, this is your place.  P.S. I've met the Grouchy John, and he's FAR from grouchy!",

There are a ton of options for drinks and they have awesome latte combinations (I recommend the Iced OG or a hot Christmas in a Cup). Drinks can be a bit sweet, but the staff is more than happy to alter your drink to be 1/4th sweet, or however you would like it. Ask about their Monday half-off drinks. Another good deal they run is their stamp card. And for those who don't drink milk, they have both Soy and Almond milk.  I have been coming here for three years now, and for someone who doesn't have family or a huge network in Vegas, it's almost like a second home to me. What other coffee shop will give you a free drink when they find out you lose your job and also gives you a reference/contact for a new job?  I look forward to many more visits at my favorite coffee shop!",

There are several lounge areas and couches, book cases full of books to indulge in, board games and interesting wall art. The staff was extremely friendly and took the time to help me decide on my first choice of coffee. I opted for \"Evil Monkey\" which was a delicious blend of chai, espresso, and banana syrup. I could settle on Evil Monkey being my regular drink at GJ's and be extremely happy, but I am thirsty to sample their other creations!  They also offer several different milk options including almond which was great for me. I wasn't blown away by the cupcake I tried, but I picked based off the novelty design on it, not by what looked the most delicious. A 12 oz specialty coffee and a cupcake came to $7 and change.  I am a fan!",

Starbucks and Coffee Bean were not cuttin it for me and this place was highly recommended to me so I decided to go.  I loved the decor and coziness of the shop. They have a TON of books and games I thought that was awesome. They had a pretty big menu with what looked like a rotating board of special drinks. I had a salted caramel latte and it was delish! Definitely up to Seattle standards and it satisfied my craving :) I will definitely be going back again and hanging out in the shop.",

Art, books, board games, WiFi and great customer service. The coffee is somewhat standard but a little on the sweet side in my opinion. Has sort of a Sambalatte Terrefazione taste to it, when I just ordered the standard Grouchy John. Regardless, it is a great place with a nice view of some places on the Las Vegas strip. Has a bit o a competition against Sambalatte.",

Looking at this place from the outside, dare I say that this place used to be one of those large chain coffee shops?  Dun dun dun...  Anyway, once I walked in, I realized that this place isn't a chain.  The decor is chic which non-corporatey furniture and looks very homey.  Service is excellent and I was asked if I've ever been there before.  They were patient with me while I perused their menu of non-corporatey drinks.    I ordered the Almond Roca Mocha latte, iced (since it was 100 degrees outside).  It truly hit the spot - woke me up (but not like \"jolt\") and it also hit the sweet craving I was looking for.   If sweet isn't your thing or if you're looking for super strong coffee, then I'm sure they make something for you to.  Oh and they have a drive thru if you're in a rush.",

Wife decided she was going to give them a chance, and ordered a mango smoothie, after inquiring as to how strong they made them. Satisfied with the employee's response, she pulled the trigger.

    "text": "Working in the customer service industry myself, I find myself very critical (and oftentimes very disappointed) in the lack of this crucial element in businesses (both big and small).   From the first time I set foot in Grouchy John's, I was immediately greeted with happy faces, great attitudes and I saw that every customer before me was greeted by name. I knew then that this place was exceptional. From that moment on, they remember what time of day you typically visit, what your drinks of choice entail, what special preferences you might have (what kind of milk or sugar you use, etc), and they even remember where you work and things you may have mentioned that you participate in outside of your daily visit. True customer service at it's best.   One of the things I was intrigued about with Grouchy's was their penchant for community support (they take their business mobile and participate in local events), and their support for local merchants, vendors and small businesses (almost everything listed on their menu can be found here in Vegas - the coffee, the tea, and even the pastries!).   THEN came the actual tasting itself... Heaven. In. A. Cup. Their menu includes a wide array of different and unique flavors, tastes and options that truly separate their menu from the leading chains, and they have something for everyone. The coffee itself is very, very smooth with a nice finish that literally tastes amazing by and of itself. If black coffee isn't your 'cup of tea', you can choose from a really neat of dairy alternatives (almond or soy milk), the usual milk or half-and-half, and sugars and sugar alternatives including agave nectar, stevia and honey (among the usual sugars). It doesn't have that 'burnt' taste you tend to chalk-up as 'normal' when visiting Starbucks or any of the other big name chains. It just tastes GOOD. Who knew coffee grown here in Vegas (Boulder City) could taste so fantastic? Although I typically get an iced americano with almond milk, their lattes are incredible, their espresso is comparable to that piece of dark chocolate you savor with each bite, and their unique flavors (Salted Caramel Latte, assorted smoothies, and 'Specialty' flavors such as the 'Butter Me Up' created by the customers and staff themselves) are something you won't find anywhere else. And the Starburst you get while waiting for your order will surely put a smile on your face.   They truly cater to the health conscious and/or people who may have an allergy or sensitivity to the typical 'dairy only' products seen on most menus.   The teas are also something left to be desired. The interesting blends and flavors brought in by a local woman who owns Joy's Teaspoon are absolutely amazing and definitely worth checking out. You won't find tea blends like hers anywhere. The Almond Cookie (decaf) is an experience in itself and you won't find anything like any of the other flavors in any other stores or coffee shops.  The pastries (brought to you by the staff at Bread and Butter and Tasty Bunz) are to die for. Be sure to get a macaroon next time you stop in. You won't be able to just have one bite.   Also, they have board games, bookshelves loaded with good reads and the atmosphere and ambiance is very inviting (think comfy couches). Stay for a while and get your work done (or just chill out and stay awhile!).   All-in-all, Grouchy John's is a small business with a big heart that specializes in making people feel good and guaranteeing you will have a wonderful and fantastic experience each and everytime you walk in to buy your daily dose of caffinated goodness. Not only will you leave with a smile, but you will be a part of the growing community we love called Grouchy John's.  Oh... And be prepared to possibly forget about Starbucks.",

Tried an iced tea (yum), a latte (so so), chai (little flavor), pumpkin muffin (delish) and an apple cider (so overly sweet I threw it out). The service is great, despite the Grouchy name. They do offer wifi, have a stash of books and games, and a comfy seating area. I have such mixed feeling about this place since my drinks haven't been consistant. Seems like I usually love what I go here and order, but from other places that are always on the mark. I haven't ordered anything here that I wasn't sure I would like, but their drinks are really hit or miss for me. Might give it another go round since it is right outside of my neighborhood.",

BUT... now they're opening up their own shop at 850 s. maryland pkwy @ wigwam!!! yay!!!",

Maybe the staff at grouchy John's can go next door and give them a consultation on how to treat customers but they are probably too cheap to pay them for their work.

Next, my coffee connesuier insticts have confirmed that these beans and the expert preparation are first rate. EVERY soothing sip of my mocha et al. has been sublime. NOT the case at your chains.

The drink menu is expansive but I only drink coffee & espresso...together sometimes, well, mostly. So, I can't speak to the quality of anything else, but would guess it is all good.  In the mornings they have an urn full of coffee with to-go cups on a table & a self-pay system for those in a hurry. BRILLIANT! Also brilliant, they have a box full of power strips for laptop users to tap into the electricity, so you don't have to fight for a plug.  The staff is super friendly & the location is easily accessible with convenient drive-thru.       GJ's is and will be one of my regular coffee joints for a long while.",

Lol Anyway I have always loved their coffee, blended drinks, even their wraps are pretty bomb. But when I go here 3xs in the last week because I'm craving their blended coffee - my problem, not theirs lol. I also live in the other side of town, so that's how you know this is one of my favorite coffee spots. I always pull up through drive-thru, they are always helpful, patient when I'm indecisive, and pretty quick. I haven't had bad service...Yet! Everyone's always friendly, I love how they give you a couple of Starbursts with your order, the blended coffee is always blended right ( you can taste the flavor of your coffee throughout ). I love their wraps because if you get everything on the sand which they have chopped green peppers in it, and I love green peppers!! I'll probably be back this week lol.",

    "text": "This is my second time coming here and I am only now questioning why I haven't been coming here whenever I needed to study! Well, Im sort of a late night study bug, but despite their early closing hour, I would've (and now will) totally come here whenever I do get the chance to study in the day time!  It's not your ordinary coffee shop for sure. You could walk in, sit down, chill, or order your go-to at the drive thru. They have a shared private parking lot in front of the entrance. There's a fair amount of specialty flavors for lattes to choose from, hot or cold, non-caffeinated or caffeinated. (Still dying to try their Sith and Jedi lattes) They also have teas and pastries as well! As for the coffee, they taste better than I've expected them to turn out. Butter-me-up and Nutella has never tasted better in a coffee cup. (:  Now let's talk about ambience. It is definitely a vibrantly decorated place (on the inside.) So much art, starwars decor, canvas', board games, and an indoor mural against the largest wall in the back room. Oh and they also have a television inside as well! I realized that they have a lot more tables than other coffee shops I've been to in Vegas, so finding a table won't be a hassle for anyone wanting to study here. Not to mention, they have a few tables outdoors as well near the drive thru.  Customer service has always been more than excellent each time I've been here. They're patient and super helpful whenever rI don't know what to order each time around. I also got starbursts upon completion of my order LOL. They come around as well and check up on you if you want water or anything.  When you do come here, don't forget to ask for a stamp card as well use the yelp check-in offer for an extra free stamp!  If you've never been here, then you HAVE to come here on you're next coffee run. Who doesn't love another unique and beautifully designed coffee shop?",

The quality is probably the best I've ever had as far as the actual coffee goes. Big chain coffee shops simply do not compare.  I've ordered as simple as iced black coffee to a few of their specialty drinks, (yum!) and they are all fabulous!  Their plain brewed coffee is flavorful, delicious and, not at all \"burnt\" tasting. Their specialty coffees are so customizable it's amazing the flavor options they have and different milks they carry to customize your perfect drink. Hot, iced, or blended.  They have a drive thru, but I always opt to walk in. The interior is awesome with a couple of couches to lounge on and so many things to look at; various art work (for sale) , a small library book nook area and a separate room that seems to have more tables and chairs for working on laptops, sitting as a group etc..  The service is stand out as well! Very nice baristas working hard to make people happy with delicious coffee creations! One of these days I'll have to try some of their pastry items... until then see you soon Grouchy John's!",

The quirky little decor of Star Wars, TWD and the books available to read makes this much more inviting than a Starbucks. It's like they want you to stay instead of just get your order and get outta here kinda feel.  I was very surprised when they offered to warm up the blueberry muffin I ordered (Yes it's summer in Vegas and I wanted something warm to go with the Yoda I ordered).   Nice music which is not too loud. Free wifi. The people aren't annoying like some people who camp out at a local Starbucks location. The menu of specialty drinks are what's going to get me to come back and try them again.",

I was for only here a couple of hours, but along with my coffee I did order the \"Yoda\", \"Mmmm, healthy you are\". This was a very tasty and much needed beverage in this Vegas heat. Spinach, kale, pineapples, and mango; this amalgam may give you the \"force\" to make it through the rest of your day.   This place also has a full food menu, many other chilly drinks and according to their website they do host events from time to time. Since I was only here here between meetings, my time was limited. I will be back soon to try some food and possibly the \"Lando\" smoothie.   Grouchy? Not even close!",

I am learning with these specialty coffee shops that it is best to simply get the signature lattes over anything you normally get at Starbucks or elsewhere.  You will thank me later for this. Most coffee shops in the area, including grouchy johns actually have signature lattes,  there happens to be a very tasty grouchy john latte (made of amaretto and white mocha) here that I discovered and enjoy very much! My friend got the PB & banana latte, which was different. It tasted like I was literally eating a Peanut butter and banana sandwich. Incredible.  The atmosphere here is very inviting, cozy and very easy going to hangout in for a while. They have board games to pass the time, tons of books, as well as comfy chairs to sit in for a while.  I thought the staff is pretty friendly and helpful, offering to bring you water, offer suggestions or bring your coffee to where you are seated.   Overall this place is a cool, hip, hangout, for your daily coffee fix. Not my number 1, but for sure in the top 10. If I am in the area I will go back!",

    "text": "I finally made it over to Grouchy John\"s. It's a shame that they don't have locations around town, but they do have a truck that pops up different places. The truck can usually be found on Sundays in the church parking lot at Lone Mountain and Jones. The stamp card they give you works at the location on Maryland Pkwy as well the truck wherever it should roam. I will make a point to stop at this location when I am on this side of town from now on, but most likely I'd visit the truck on Sundays since it's closer to where I live.   There isn't a grouchy vibe inside, it's a happy one! This is a place that is kid friendly and they have a variety of board games and stuff to do while you enjoy your drink. I was even given some Starburst to snack on while I waited for my order and this happened inside as well the time ordered in the drive-thru, cute!   On the menu I saw several tasty looking drinks. I've had both hot and iced drinks and really enjoyed them. The \"Grouchy John\" is white chocolate and amaretto. I would suggest trying that your first time or you could go funky with the \"Curious George\" that's banana and honey. They have a little something for everyone here flavor-wise and prices range from about $2 -5 each drink though some of the all natural smoothies and a couple other drinks are a smidge more. Sizes are 12, 16 and 20 oz.    They also have smoothies, muffins, donuts, bagels and oatmeal on the menu. I was told by the girl who helped me that the donuts were brought in from Carl's. I know Carl's has a following, but I personally find those donuts to be overpriced and just average tasting. These are the same brand donuts that you find in most 7-11 and other convenient stores and markets around town since Carl's Donuts has deals with several places to sell their donuts. It would be nice if they got them from a mom and pop place since we do have a few really good donuts places, but it is what it is. I'll gladly stick to the coffee!",

The upside is that they offer to make you another drink if you didn't like yours. The downside is that they're still expensive drinks.",

I was rushing to school so I pulled away and then realized it was only a 12 oz. My roommate and her boyfriend were in the car behind me. They ordered their drinks which were different kinds. They both received the same drink. They didn't realize till they pulled away also. Whoever is making the coffee today keeps messing up the orders because that was 2 in a row. Besides that, the coffee is really tasty.",

    "text": "This is my first time coming here and found out about it through a friend. I question why she didn't recommend this place to me before because this place is amazing!   Initially when you walk into the shop, you'll notice that there is art work posted everywhere. From marvel characters to star wars, they have it posted on their wall! The front room has a few tables and a little library filled with books you can read. Don't worry if you can't find any tables in the front! There is a connecting rooms and in the back are more tables and a shelf filled with board games!   When ordering, the workers are very helpful. They have speciality drinks and are willing to explain what they taste like. They have star wards themed drinks, like the Jedi (white chocolate, coconut) or the Sith (Dark chocolate, coconut). I don't know about you but I'm one who can't drink a lot of dairy. Not to worry though, they offer almond or soy milk substitutions. I ended up trying the Jedi and it was really good. It was a little too sweet for my liking but it tastes amazing! They also have a stamp card, so you can get a free drink. If you check in, I believe its one extra stamp?  I know they host painting classes in the backroom at 7ish sometimes and close 8, so keep that in mind if you're planning on doing some work or studying. If you haven't tried this place, I highly recommend it. Great drinks, great service and great atmosphere.",

The menu has coffees with cute names like, \"Albino Monkey\", \"OG\", \"The Twinkie\" and many more. It's not just simple vanilla lattes it's a full experience. My friends and I have been going here for a few years now and play with the provided board and card games while we hang out and get some work done. Grouchy Johns has student discounts and a punch card for a free drink after every 10. So every drink counts towards something. They have milk substitutes, which is great for us lactose- intolerant folks. Grouchy Johns has two rooms with one in the back loaded with shelves of books you can read while you enjoy your coffee. They have a small tv as well and were playing Friends the other day!!!! The staff is so friendly, a bit load at times but I can't mark them for that. They have let me wait for friends before ordering as well. Safe environment and a nice drive- thru. Look out for their art classes that they do as well. Can't wait to stop by before my first day back to school!",

Ive had the Grouchy John Blended and The Jedi ,makes ya wanna scream yeeeehaw!  And the service is great staff is amazing!",

    "text": "There's free WiFi here and a drive through, plenty of seating and outlets and a quiet atmosphere that's perfect for studying.  Lots of star wars decor and even drinks on the menu are cleverly named. I was greeted right away and the cashier (I think Robert) explained everything to me and told me to take my time.   +1 for having unsweetened almond milk ($0.40 extra) because not a lot of places use unsweetened.   They can make any of their specialty drinks iced, hot, or blended. Hot comes in 12 or 16 oz and I THINK iced and blended comes in 12,16 or 20. Extra shots of espresso are $1 each. I also like that they have smoothies as well for $6.85.  Drinks here are on the sweeter side.... like super super sweet. I got the honey booboo which has hazelnut and honey in it, with 4 instead of 5 pumps of hazelnut and I couldn't drink more than 4 sips without taking it back and asking for an added shot.  The drink was good, but too sweet for my liking. Robert ended up making it half sweet for me which was nice of him. He even offered to make any drink on the menu for me but I said I liked what I ordered and just wanted it half sweet. While the new drink wasn't amazing.... (I'd probably order less honey and 3 pumps hazelnut next time for some flavor), I appreciate the fact that he was so nice about remaking my drink.  There seems to be a lot of regulars here and the cashiers remember their drinks! Love how friendly everyone is and how it's not a crazy hectic atmosphere.   If you like your drink on the sweeter side, this place is perfect for you. If you don't, just request is less or half sweet and adjust your drinks to your liking.",

There was a line at the register, we were about 6 people back, and the drive-thru was jammin'. Once we got to the register to order, our drinks were done in about 3 minutes. We were shocked at how quickly our drinks were made, and brought to us.   Everyone working there was super friendly. I love that there is a t.v., lots of comfy sofas, little corner spots to sit as well as tons of board games and SO many books to read. This place seems small when you walk in, but there is an entire back area to sit in that can accommodate a larger group.   The drinks were tasty, and they were super fast. Really really like Grouchy John's. And their logo is awesome.",

    "text": "I drink a lot of espresso. A lot. Did you hear me? I mean a LOT! Which means I really really know good coffee. Got it?  I also frequently travel for work, and, amazingly, I can find decent, or even good, coffee near everywhere I regularly go to. That said, truly great coffee is (very) hard to come by, especially with that stupid light-roast trend sweeping through NorCal.  So maybe that's why my favorite and most notable shots of espresso have been elsewhere. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much after a quick dinner in the area before heading southward (why does work send me to Needles? Just, why?), but I wanted some coffee for the road ahead, and this place was convenient.  So I walked in... and almost walked out. It has all the hallmarks of being a poor coffeeshop. The concentration on smoothies and flavored syrup lattes. The multiple sizes of cappuccino. The espresso served in paper cups! But I ordered anyway (after repeating more than once that I insisted on a ceramic cup), with a cringe and a glance around to find the sugar.  This espresso. THIS espresso. It was bloody amazing. Properly short, with a thick dark-speckled crema. A tiny hint of bitterness in the aftertaste (yes, that's a good thing, you sugar-loving imbiciles). I was happy.  It's not often that an espresso forces me to notice it. This one did. So, Mr. Grouchy John, if you should read this, stand up and take a bow. Maybe do one of those little parade-wave things where you rotate your palm back and forth in a semi-circle. And bask in the light of these five stars.  If I'm around, I'll be back in.",

Super dry gas station quality Danish, had to be a few days old. The vanilla latte tasted like chemical sweetener, bitter like a Starbucks swill I could barely stomach. I search for keyword \"roaster\" when I travel to find coffee places and I was greatly disappointed with not only grouchy John's but also Yelp here. Why this place has so many stars I have no idea, worst coffee I've had in a long time. I Guess there's a reason Starbucks and Dunkin donuts are everywhere but I won't be coming back if I can help it.

Last month, I found myself 2 minutes away from Grouchy John's before a dance workshop, and in desperate need of caffeine.    I popped in and got one of my old standards:  The Blended Grouchy John.   Let me tell you, the quality of the drinks and the standard of service have remained the same:  Absolutely excellent.    I've been in a handful of other times since then, most recently being over the weekend where I tried my first pour over at this shop.   Well.  I have found my new favorite.   The pour over...I mean...I seriously don't get HOW it is SO different from drip coffee and french press, but....this is the first coffee I've been able to drink with no sugar.    I'm super impressed, especially with the friendliness of service that has always been the standard.  Walking in and hearing \"Welcome back\" is one of the best feelings in the world for me.    I love you, Grouchy John's.  I'm so glad I've come back.",

    "text": "Why would anyone get coffee at a cafe named Grouchy Johns?! Anyways, finally got the chance to give this place a try since I had it bookmarked for awhile. My first impression when I got to this cafe was the atmosphere. It felt like I was in a game room at friends house or an attic that was converted to a cafe. The cool thing about my visit was the friendly and helpful baristas. I was thinking they were going to be a group of Grouchy Baristas that hate their job, lol. However, it was the complete opposite and was a pleasant experience.  Onto the coffee drinks, I got the Honey Latte and it was surprisingly good. It had Vanilla extract and Honey mixture that paired well with the espresso shots and milk over iced. I got the chance to try out the Mint Mocha and that was okay. I do like that this independant coffee shop has a good amount of seating and divided into 2 sections. The main room has sofas and tables kind of seperated in sections with local artwork, game boards and reading materials throughout the cafe. The other room is more like a bright classroom/conference are for group studys and meetings. So your bound to find a large portion of students thoughout this cafe. A great place to grab a coffee and hangout or study.  2017 Yelp Review #19",

I wanted to take it back for more heat but we already drove away. It was really good flavor wise. Salted caramel flavoring stood out perfectly, however, the drink itself was more on the super sweet side for my liking. Next time, I will ask for less sweet.   We also ordered a small mango smoothie and my husband liked it. He said especially because it tasted like it was made from real mangoes with real mango chunks. Love the convenience of the drive-thru and we got our drinks pretty fast. Will return!!",

She told me about Grouchy Johns and how it all started as a food truck. *not many drink food trucks around turning into stores so this was interesting.  Walked in and was definitely noticed by the workers and was greeted as i came up to the register. The pretty lady informed me about all the new deals coming up and the top 5 most popular drinks.  I was in a dilemma so she kindly and patiently helped me out.  I ended up pursuing the Nutella Blended. It tastes heavenly. Just like diabetes.   Kind guy who made my drink brought it out and walked it to me. A + ON CUSTOMER SERVICE.  the setting was comics and STAR WARS. love love it.  the art was amazing and it had seating and comfy couches all around.  Definitely a new spot for me to come to again when i just want to get away from the house or just be around to study or hang out :)  LOVE IT!",

Shout out Suzy H for the suggestion coffee and conversations.....knowing that never been Grouchy my beast partner recommended new spot for me! Talk about everything hip, cool, NON corporate/chain, and above all PERSONALITY. Right off the top before walk in the bright yellow color, the mobile trailer sits outside, the character that comes with the name/logo, and knowing only ONE location. The moment you open the door thinking myself SO much going on inside coffee shop is the last thing think walked in. Talk about hippie or woodstock feeling for me. The local artists (I think local) works all over the walls (not just one style from painting, size of the artwork, bold big colors, or think the coolest original artwork seen in any business second room completely covers one wall) not only original but great way support local community. All the different boards games anyone can pick up and play game. The books not just handful but few shelves of book from kids books to adult books. I would think like the board games community style just make sure put them back. The furniture nothing uniform in the place most part different style and sizes for all groups of coffee drinkers go hang out. The names of the drinks are very creative! Not that the place not modernize still have your widescreen televisions keep you entertain, pretty sure they have wifi, and lots of outlets plug in electronics over coffee. Not forgot about pastry they have display with few options not super big but sell bagels, cookies, and other stuff. Not sure if they make them on property but they were looking good. The workers are AWESOME. I love not only super friendly, explain everything cause talk about options, and just feel all positive vibes. I think about coffee more then coffee for me but more like place relaxing, chill, and place read great book or great conversation with family. Grouchy without doubt epitomize that feeling for me. Why without doubt deserve five star rating. Just wish the place was closer on my side of town. =((   Evil Monkey was not evil but heavenly. Not even sure all the things in it but saw chai that sparks my interest. I was really happy with my choice. They have stamp card program too.",

I don't want to spoil it for you, so that's all I am going to say. If you live nearby, or pass it on your commute, stop in and see for yourself.  Strongly recommend going inside, at least for your first visit. Check out the interior, but more importantly study the menu and find your happy drink :)",

Walked into a much larger space than it seemed from the outside, with a whole separate room in addition to the main space with even more tables. There are books, paintings, plenty of entertainment as you enjoy your coffee. There's a wide selection of drinks on their menu, but I usually go for the simple ones and ordered an iced chai latte. I always love coffee shops with stamp cards, and this one is no exception. You even get a couple starbursts as a treat upon paying. There's a variety of seating areas, plenty to choose from and all relatively well-spaced from each other to have enough privacy. The chai was great, definitely makes me want to try more of their drinks. Will come back whenever I get the chance!",

I took a bite and it was oooo sooo good.. they offered me a stamp card when we paid and my hubby was like why did you that? I'm like because if they good we coming back they were beyond good & very quaint spot everyone was so friendly which I love.. only one thing I noticed if you check in you get extra stamp.

I tried a medium size OG (salted caramel and vanilla) iced coffee. I think it was a bit sweet for my liking, but it was said to be a favorite amongst customers. The staff asked whether I enjoyed it or wanted something else, but I kept my drink cause the sugariness was enough to keep me alert during my stay.  I played a few board games in the back of the shop on some nice round tables. The rest of the customers there were doing some type of personal work on laptops or were in study groups. They cater to a very young crowd of college students. The colors of the venue pop with bright orange. The place is clean, the bathroom could be a bit cleaners, but everything was really pleasant.   The atmosphere is just right for study groups. The staff checks in on the groups regularly and offers water and refills. I know they care if their guests are happy. I'll let you know, I'm definitely happy. I hope my board game group continues to come here.",

I have sampled most of the drink menu and many of the breakfast foods offered, and have never left disappointed..   Why do I love Grouchy John's? I'll break it down in list format:  -I adore how I walk in and am greeted by name.  -I am a big fan of the promotions they offer, like their punch card (double stamps for checking in on social media), free birthday drink and on Mondays one specialty drink is 50% off.  -I am thankful I can tell the barista I am undecided on what to order and get a great recommendation. -I appreciate that Grouchy John's is active in our community and hosts donation drives and other events.  -I enjoy that I can view the artwork by local artists while I wait for my order.  -I am happy that hours have been extended and Grouchy John's is open until 9 pm now.  There are so many reasons to love Grouchy John's, which is why I will happily drive right by multiple other coffee shops to come here. xoxo much love GJs!",

This definitely reminds me of a coffee shop I would come across when I lived in Downtown NYC. Funky music comes out of the speakers and eclectic art hangs on the walls that you can actually buy if you're interested in picking up some artwork with your coffee.   As for their menu-they've got a wide range of flavors and concoctions that I'm sure will satisfy your tastebuds. My best friend did get something with Nutella and her only complaint was that it was a little too thick. I really appreciated that they had almond milk as an option because not all places will offer that.   I definitely enjoyed the ambiance and could see myself just hanging there getting some work done, sipping on some coffee.",

They have tons of fun drinks to try and as a non coffee drinker, I was impressed by the variety! I ordered the \"Shirley temple of doom\" which is a matcha Green tea smoothie with blended maraschino cherries and it was delicious!   3. Their employees! As soon as I walked into the coffee shop I was greeted with a warm hello and then when I was trying to decide what to order they were patient and provided some suggestions which was super helpful!  I really love this place and will most definitely go back!!!",

Whenever I go to either location I've had my order messed up or I've needed a drink remade because it's bland. I love coming here for the nostalgia but I honestly can't say this is a five star coffee experience anymore.",

My friend and I split a croissant breakfast sandwich with egg, choice of cheese and bacon and it was awesome. It was Freshly made and devoured in minutes. Yum.  I don't drink coffee but my friend said that the bulletproof coffee was solid. I would definitely come back on a future trip.",

I went in at 8am on St Pattys Day and I felt like I walked into a shamrock parade, a fun one. The baristas were all wearing leprechaun hats and the customers in green tie die shirts.  I ordered a matcha latte (to support St Pattys day) and a lemon muffin. The matcha latte was foamy and sweet and the muffin had icing and was warmed up for me. Both were great and I'd get them again.",

    "text": "Growing up my entire life I have always lived by a Starbucks so I never really believed in going to a smaller coffee place especially since I don't even drink coffee! It wasn't until my best friend started going there and making me get her tea did I start wondering about what made this place so special. I took a sip of her South Sea Magic and I instantly fell in love with this place.  Unlike most places where the tea taste is expected with the traditional black or green tea with the 1 flavor note or if you're lucky, maybe a blend of a mint for a little bit of a fresh taste. Grouchy John has a more complex blend. I have no idea where they get their batch from but even their Sencha Tea which is a darker green tea that is popular in Japan tastes amazing.   Since I live a few blocks away from this location, this is a spot I visit weekly. Great sitting spaces if you want to chill and get some work done. A very unique coffee shop/comic book/library decor. And of course the #1 perk is that the drive thru is open 24/7.  I have had a few mishaps coming here but overall service is great and the teas will make me come back every time.",

We were welcomed by the staff & had plenty of room in the back room to work on our project.   I'm not a coffee drinker & had never been here, but now that I've seen how bustling this place is I'll return if I ever need a people fix. I did order an iced tea. They asked me what kind but I don't know a thing about tea-I thought iced tea was iced tea. I don't know good from bad. But they treated me with respect & I appreciate that.  This place consists of 2 large rooms with a few cubby holes if you're looking for a bit of privacy. There's lots of unique & fun art by local artists for sale on the walls, there's a shelf of games to play & books to read are scattered about. Grouchy John's is so inviting & there are lots of things to keep a conversation going. (This is a great place to meet a blind/online date, a few of which I witnessed while I was there. Good luck, folks.)  I had eaten just before I arrived but next time I'll try some of the food there. Lots of pastries, cookies, bagels & wraps in the display case & on the menu.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

I am a boring person and like my coffee black, but I have been pleased with their iced and hot versions. They have a large selection of frappes, but I have never ordered one. They look delicious though.   Ambiance - It is more of hang out then just a coffee shop. They have board games, books, and newspapers. You could spend a day in there! The staff is friendly and quick (as long as the line isn't too long). The outdoor patio is nice. It is shaded, so on the hot days, you won't be frying like an egg.",

John & J.J are one of the most friendliest & amazing people in the business. They certainly know how to prepare coffee like it's nobody's business that's for sure. I love coming in & seeing the Grouchy John & his crew's (far from grouchy) contagious  smiles.  So far I've tried their almond roca mocha, evil monkey, lemon ice tea, hot spiced cider & blended fruit smoothies. I like their creative coffee concoctions. It's like drinking a delicious dessert that really perks u up. After work, I go there for their chamomile tea & tasty pastries. I also appreciate  how they provide soy milk & almond milk to substitute for milk. A major plus for us lactose intolerant people.  There's a warm inviting feeling when u walk in. This place has a great set up & better seating options than most coffee shops I've been in. I love that cozy sitting area w/ couch & big arm chairs where u can just relax after a long day at work. They also have cool board games & free wifi if u just wanna hang out for awhile drinking your tasty beverages. There is a positive vibe you can feel when you come here. I will definitely be coming back real soon. No doubt.",

The menu boasts different healthy juices, smoothies, and coffees for those looking to get their java buzz on.  The walls are covered with paintings of Daleks, Storm Troopers, and other Sci-Fi stuff that I'm pretty sure is created by local artists.

Today was my first time coming here and went inside, instead of the drive through.  What a cute little coffee shop!  There are numerous books/games to play all around this little shop.  There is interesting art work adorning the walls.  Oh, and I love the names of some of the drinks.  Saw one that was called the Honey Boo Boo!  Service was top notch, very friendly, and so quick!  Prices are on par with Starbucks I feel, but don't quote me on that because I hardly go.  I wish this shop was closer because I would frequent it quite often.  I love the little mom and pop type businesses so this place gets two thumbs up from me.  I will update my review when I make it back over here and try the drive thru.",

I know getting your drink modified using soy milk and adding a pump or two may add 30-50 cents extra (though when I worked for a coffee shop I didn't charge for an extra few pumps), but for the size and I believe because it's not a chain like Starbucks or Coffee Bean, I would think they would want to compete with their prices.

The drinks are fantastic (with tons of dairy free options), the service is excellent (they are all super friendly and not at all grouchy) and they even have a drive thru for when you're in a rush. If you have the time to go inside I recommend it as it's very comfortable with little nooks for readers and couches for socializers. Plus, if you get their stamp card and check in on Yelp when you visit you get double stamps, that equals a free drink every five visits!",

It really just depends on what you're feeling that day.   The customer service was great. Everyone was very friendly. They even offered me a stamp card for the next time I'm in town. I declined the offer, but would definitely go back.  As for the atmosphere and environment, its hard to describe... They had artwork for sale, and memorabilia, and games, and book. I went for the coffee, and stayed for everything else they had to offer when you walk in.",

Unfortunately there is an inconsistency in the flavor.  I love the Evil Monkey and even tho it's always been good, sometimes it's been GREAT! I also love the Dora and have faced the same problem... I hate that the flavor varies.  When it's off, it's too sweet or is under sweetened with an espresso type of finish.  But either way way, I can appreciate it. The flavor notes that are promised always come through so I come back.  This place is worth a shot!",

Coffees, teas, smoothies, and juices coexist peacefully together on the menu, and the dining room has shelves of books, newspapers, and games, just in case you don't have a device to take advantage of their free wifi. Basically, it's your best friend's living room, if your friend knew how to make a million drinks and had a pastry case handy.   In short, this place has everything you could need to spend hours in a coffee shop with friends or solo. The staff are so friendly here, they'll probably end up your friends within a visit or two.  The Grouchy John is their namesake coffee drink for a strong and delicious reason, but if it's too late in the day for caffeine just ask for their Shirley Temple of Doom- a blended matcha green tea drink with maraschino cherries. Part dessert, part smoothie, all uniquely tasty.",

The walls have a lot of different art that makes it fun to look at. This place is truly a hidden treasure; they deserve so much more recognition than they receive. They also have such a large variety of beverage options- smoothies, teas, seasonal drinks, and of course...coffee! They also have so many substitutions for milk which is so helpful.

The coffee wasn't burned-tasting like Starbucks, and the ingredients were fresh. Plus, the staff were really helpful (especially when you don't know what to order!). The iced mocha was smooth and rich, and the black and white tasted like a mocha chocolate silk pie.   I will definitely be frequenting this place more often!",

When it was handed to me, I noticed how dark it was, like I was getting iced black coffee. I took one sip and it gave me bitter beer face. It was so artificial and syrupy tasting, I couldn't even get it down. It was terrible. I can't even tell if there was espresso in there, I would it that was a syrup as well. Yuck.",

    "text": "After a hard day at work, Grouchy John's Coffee Shop makes me a joyful coffee drinker. It is one of a handful of coffee shops that I routinely patronize.    Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the antithesis of the corporate coffee shop. It has the personality and energy level of a downtown Las Vegas coffee shop. It is a slice of downtown Las Vegas in the southeast Las Vegas Valley. Outside the entrance is the iconic Grouchy John's coffee shop. This is an omen that the customer is in for a unique coffee shop experience. Inside the lobby resembles a student union with the touch of a living room. On the way to the counter, which is on the right, are numerous seating arrangements. There are the standard tables and chairs throughout the lobby. At the far left corner are plush chairs arranged around a small table. At the far window are bar seats that are popular with Internet users. Bookcases holding books share the space with the seats. Grouchy John's is more than coffee. It is also a library. In my opinion, the library is more of a decoration. From what I see, the majority of the customers are on-line reading digital material compliments of the free WiFi (myself included). The sight and smell of the books improve cozy vibe of the place.    At the counter, the employees are friendly. They notice repeat customers, and make them feel welcome. They show their appreciation for repeat customers with a card that earns stamps toward a free beverage. Forget the card at home. They will not be grouchy. They will stamp another card which you can use with the other card toward a free refill. When I first started going here, they would visit my table to ask me if I needed a refill or a Starburst. So much for grouchy.    My beverage of choice has been a cup of coffee with peanut butter syrup, This tastes like sipping melted Reeses Pieces with the advantages of caffeine. Today, I tried the Almond Roca Mocha Late. It tasted like a hot liquid desert beverage with the advantages of caffeine.     If you decide to visit Grouchy John's Coffee Shop, please keep in mind a few things. On weekdays it closes at 8:00 PM., which in my book is way too early. High quality coffee based beverages are delicious on the taste buds whereas they are poison on the breath. I highly recommend bringing breath mints. And most of all, do not expect to leave grouchy.",

If you want to go inside and spend some time there, they have board games and comfortable couches! Which is fantastically unique, and fun for you and friends.   Star Wars decor? Amazing.

There's a shelf full of old books in case you want to hang out for awhile, and lots of other great pictures around the cafe (One does not simply waka waka into Mordor!). The staff is nice and they usually deliver your food to you (drinks are set up on the bar). They were patient with me, being my first time there, telling me about the menu and what sort of combinations you could order. There is certainly plenty to choose from! The coffee is great. I ordered the Butter Beer latte, and also tried the Sith latte. Both were major sugar bombs and delicious. They have a large selection of names that will have you cracking up, from \"Honey Booboo\" to \"Shirley Temple of DOOM\". They all sound delicious and can't wait to try more. I also had the Apple Fritter and Bearclaw pastries. They were warmed upon request and were gooey and awesome! I don't know where they get their pastries from but it's definitely a new favorite in my book. The breakfast sandwiches look very good and are cooked to a nice crisp, I can see why this is a favorite of people and it's surely a new favorite of mine. I can't wait to come back here.",

Once I got a drink here, I have not bought coffee from anywhere else in Las Vegas!  I am from the NW, so I'm kind of a snob when it comes to a good cup of joe, but the actual coffee that is brewed here, is uniquely delicious! The blended drinks are yummy too (and can be made with any kind of milk, yes!), but even if you are a simple, straight forward vanilla latte kind-of-person you can still find something perfect because every one of their drinks can be customized to your liking!  Also, what rocks about this small business coffee shop is that their stamp card system is set up to benefit their customers! You get a free drink after you purchase 10 drinks, which is already a great deal compared to some other punch-cards, BUT the best part is that their staff are always so warm and kind that they give you extra stamps and free starbursts just to appease you! I love coming here with my doggies too because they have a dog friendly patio and free dog treats!",

They have fun punny names for their drinks and they're delicious.  If you're a local, they have a stamp card which is definitely worth it, I get free coffees often because of it.   If you end up going in during the day is super awesome, they have board games, art work, and collectables all over the place.  It gives off this hipster vibe without the hipster attitude. So stop by, it's definitely worth checking out.",

    "text": "There's definitely a reason why I can't stop myself from frequently visiting Grouchy John's over and over again.   First and foremost, every coffee beverage I've enjoyed at this establishment has been expertly crafted and brewed to perfection. Their coffee menu options are endless, so not matter what type of coffee beverage you prefer, they will certainly have the perfect concoction created to satisfy your caffeine fix. Their blended PBM is my absolute favorite because it's the perfect combination of coffee, chocolate, peanut butter, and of course, bananas! Plus, I can't help but love the nerdy spin they added to their menu by naming drinks after iconic characters such as Chewbacca, Yoda, and even the adorable Curious George!   In fact, I recently tried a blended version of their Chewbacca specialty drink and I must say from the moment that first sip touch my lips, I couldn't stop myself from belting \"RRRAARRWHHGWWRR\" out of pure joy and utterly complete satisfaction. I hope to one day be able to say I've conquered the entire menu because I'm 100% certain that I will always be satisfied with whatever beverage I purchase from this wonderful coffee joint.",

I ordered a hot Grouchy Jonhs and it's delicious.  It's got subtle hints of both white chocolate and amaretto that surprisingly don't make the drink too sweet.  I usually like my coffe black so I'm actually excited to try that next time haha  Today was my first time visiting, was on my way to work so I used the drive thru, which is awesome in itself for a small local coffee shop. Will definitely be back soon!",

The breakfast sandwiches though are my fave. They're fresh and not premodern which I love. You can get it on a croissant or a bagel and they're both delicious, as my husband and I get one of each. I'll def be back to try more drinks. The AMR is a yummy balance of Almond Roca and mocha. The evil monkey is just a little too much on the sweet side for me, I'd probably ask for less banana syrup, as it overpowered it. I did get it iced and when it started warming up it actually tasted better. So maybe hot is the way to go for the evil monkey.  Overall love their sandwiches and muffins, coffee- still trying to find my fave.",

I am sad to say that today will be my last visit. I have had coffee orders needing to be sent back countless number of times. As for today, my boyfriend and I ordered two breakfast sandwiches and sat at the high top table counter while waiting for our food to be made. The employee slammed the sandwiches on the table without making eye contact or telling us which was which. She has always had a short temper and rude personality, tutoring me on how to properly order my coffee in the past. The employees were extremely loud and joking around behind the counter. It'd be amazing if gave their customers that same energy. Very unpleasant atmosphere. I will drive the extra mile to other nicer local coffee businesses.  So very disappointed.",

There were two connected rooms with different energies.  The first room was busier with the cash register and customers going in and out.  The second room had a relaxing feel where people could read and study.  There was a piano, recliner, board games, and cool Star Wars themed decor and drinks!  I got a special smoothie which was posted on a flyer.  Its title, \"Shirley Temple of Doom\", intrigued me, so I got it!  The healthy Matcha Green Tea with the Maraschino Cherry flavor blended well - The cherries decreased the bitterness of the Matcha!  Yay!

The workers at the front were loud and telling stories amongst themselves, seemed put off to help me. The place was SUPER dirty. Dirty everywhere. Dirty tables with crumbs and sticky on them. When I ordered, zero mention of stamp card. Put off attitude. Immediately went back to their random loud convo.   After sitting at a dirty table out front near the tv, I went to the back room area. Sat at one of the large round tables and of course AGAIN it was dirty and sticky.  The parking lot is a nightmare, was scared to park my car because of crazy people in and out of their junkers. Not sure where all the crappy cars came from, the place was almost empty.  In the back room I look up and notice shit everywhere. Boxes, supplies, furniture and dirty crap lines the nasty painted back wall. Stacks of shit everywhere. Flowing out of the kitchen? What is all that crap?  Then the smell.........this place REEKS of dirty soured mops. It made me dizzy. I don't know if they serve food here but along with a rotten mop there is probably dirty garbage cans and rotten food. If the dining room smells that bad, what kind of funk is  going on behind the scenes?!?!? Nasty.   Clean this place, remove all the junk, scrub the floors, scrub the tables and chairs, and give this place a need paint job.  Disgusting. I will never go back.",

    "text": "I like Grouchy Johns a lot because it's pretty unique in decor. It basically is just a very random place. It has random art all over the walls, a bunch of Star Wars stuff, a book shelf full of books--kinda dusty, but still cool. There are board games and other miscellaneous games to play so you should never get bored, and they have a cool mural on the very back wall, which artsy people would probably appreciate. The customer service is usually pretty good--they're always friendly. I've talked to one of the owners a few times and he's pretty cool.   My favorite drink from here is a large hot caramel macchiato with whole milk, half sweet with no foam. Regarding this drink: most of the time it is made properly. Sometimes it's bitter, which I've learned from my Starbucks experience is usually due to the amount of time it took to make the shots of espresso. I'm not usually a complainer, but one time I said something about it being bitter and I even mentioned the fact that I get the drink every day, yet the guy told me it's because I get it half sweet. Well, I tried not to be rude in return so I just asked if they can remake it after they offered to just add more sweetener. They remade it but I felt like it was also sweeter so I gave up trying. Like I said, they're always friendly, but maybe they're not all experienced in making good espresso? I don't know...  With all of that said, don't hesitate to come here if you feel like trying it. They have good coffee, good pastries, and games to keep you and your friends occupied!",

Coffee: Seriously pretty good.  I was actually surprised but im a coffee snob from the NW. So Portland people shouldn't be afraid. Enjoy.   Atmosphere was a little crazy but honestly that's what makes the place I'm sure.  Tons of stuff on the walls, crazy Star Wars swag everywhere, not a bad place to work or study if you can get a seat.  People kept coming in steady while I was there so obviously they have a following of some kind...   Had a muffin and an Americano... And yes, I said \"three\" shots in that small cup thanks.  Lol   AS I LEFT I THOUGHT: If I'm close and need a coffee fix I will come back for sure.",

One of my co-workers is actually obsessed with the coffee/smoothies here and kept telling me I should come here. Took me a while, but I finally went by to try it.   On my way to work I decided to make a pitstop, I was super happy that the location on Maryland Pkwy had a drive-thru. Seeing how I had no clue what to order, I literally ordered the first thing I saw. I was not disappointed. My first drink ever from Grouchy John's was a Butter-Me-Up, iced. Cookie Butter, Honey and Vanilla - Highly recommend if you have a sweet tooth. The person working drive-thru was super nice, and even while waiting for my drink, struck up a conversation with me. It made my first experience way more personable and something to remember. Next up on the \"To Try\" List is Dora, A.R.M and Twinkie.   Definitely if you are heading towards the Henderson, and able to exit on Windmill and onto Maryland Pkwy... go for it! It is a bit out of the way, but it is worth the stop before you run your daily errands, or like me, a stop before work.",

Our first time was through the drive-thru. The drive-thru menu was very easy to read but so hard to decide because of their great coffee variety & choices! Most drinks can be either hot, iced, or blended so whatever your mood, they've got you covered! I ordered an iced dirty chai with soy milk & my better half got a blended vanilla frappe. Like I said, we went back a second day in a row so the drinks were obviously the bomb to both of us!  Today's beverage choices were a tad different & equally delightful! I tried the 'Butter-Me-Up' frappe because it had been recommended to me by the girl at the drive-thru when we were waiting for our beverages the day before! Her recommendation was phenomenal especially if you're a cookie butter fan! My lover got the blended vanilla frappe but this time with an added espresso shot! We also got a vanilla shake for our little one & a caramel frappe for the mother-in-law... all of which were incredibly incomparable to any other coffee drinks around!  Their espresso taste is so rich, smooth & creamy that it's flavor is what's so desirable about this place! Not to mention, the inside of this shop is too stinkin' cute! I was in awe once we walked in on day two to see so much creative color, Star Wars & all around good vibes! A huge plus for me is that they have a stamp card! Each drink gets you a stamp & ten stamps gets you a free drink! The greater value of this incentive is if you check into Grouchy John's then you earn two stamps per drink! Pretty sweet deal if you ask me! If I would've been offered a stamp card the first time around & knew to check in on the second day then I'd already have a free beverage for tomorrow! (So definitely not hard to fill up a card & enjoy a coffee on them!)  Overall, this will definitely be our newest chill & drink spot & I can't wait to drink our way through their menu! Mahalo Grouchy John's!",

I walked in to this cozy little establishment, that had a living room vibe going on one side and restaurant open area on the other. I was immediately greeted and helped by a super nice guy. He was very helpful, friendly, and happy. Made me feel welcomed, and put me in an even better mood. He recommended a few choices, and helped me decide on the large iced coffee with cookie butter. ( I love trader joes cookie butter, so when he said they use that and hand mix it in, I was sold) He waited for me to try it and said if I didn't like it, they would make something else. After a few sips, I decided I was good. The coffee was good, but a little too sweet for me. It was slightly salty as well, but not too overbearing. I think it was the cookie butter that gave it the sweet salty taste mixed with the almond milk, but who knows. Either way it was good and I was very impressed with the overall experience. It was a creative, different, and the taste explodes in your mouth. I'd definitely come back for some coffee on my next trip to Vegas!",

Grouchy Johns is certainly my favorite from what I have tried so far. I generally only drink iced mocha's or iced coffee especially when it's hot out. The mocha is very good, especially with an extra shot to tame the sweetness of the Chocolate they use. I would give an immediate 5 stars if they used Ghirardelli as its by far the best for a mocha but the syrup they use is good enough to satisfy my craving a couple times a week. The pastries are always excellent and I love their bagels. They also have a great variety of drinks with unique names to mix it up. I always try to support the local joints especially after having worked for the \"big chain\" for a couple years when I was in college.",

Plenty of board games, art, and books around for all ages. Seating is plenty but I'm sure it gets full in the mornings (Came mid afternoon).  My husband ordered an espresso and it was good and smooth. I ordered a Grouchy John latte, hot. Delicious and had the right amount of coffee ( Chains version always taste either too sweet or the coffee is bitter). It's True their menu is vast and may even seem a bit inconsistent but this isn't starbucks. I like walking in a coffee shop and knowing there is something new and not just a seasonal thing.",

Between them, Sambalatte, Sunrise Coffee, and The Beat-- you really don't have to rely on Starbucks or Coffee Bean for good coffee and a great study environment.  The custom coffees are well crafted concoctions. I went with the Grouchy John, which contained banana syrup, almaretto, and was made with almond milk. My girlfriend had one of their other delicious concoctions-- this place can do no wrong.  The place is fairly spacious and is an excellent place to study or just unwind. Of course, the free wiFi will also encourage you to make a trip. And you'll probably see Grouchy John himself behind the counter helping to make your drinks and asking you how things are going.   If you are one of those coffee foodies or if you just want a nice, mom and pop owned place to study, this is where you need to be.",

All of the specialty drinks are to die for, and even the iced tea is top notch. There is something for everyone and it's impossible to get bored with the infinite drink possibilities.  I've been coming here for about 9 months pretty regularly and, not only are the drinks to die for, the people are incredible. All of the employees have positive attitudes and make you feel welcome regardless of whether you're just stopping in to grab a cup of coffee before work or staying until close to finish up a research paper.  The environment is also incredibly unique. It is the best place to be when you want to lounge on a couch and read or sit at a table and finish some homework.  I can't recall a time when i've walked in and not seen at least one person sitting on their laptop.  It is the ideal place to work (studies show coffee shop environments promote the best kind of learning due to the plethora of noises).  They are incredibly involved in the community and strive to make each persons experience incredibly personal. They support local art and seeing it on the walls of the shop adds to its unique environment.  Through my numerous visits I have met so many people and had great conversations with people who I hadn't known that morning.  Since I am here so often, I am a HUGE fan of the punch card and always get excited when I have a free drink. If you're looking for not only a great cup of coffee, but a great experience, look no further!",

    "text": "I randomly stumbled onto Grouchy John's Coffee Shop one Vegas trip and it was by far one of the best Vegas trips ever, in part, due to this establishment. And now every time I'm in Vegas, I try and visit The customer service is on point: the baristas are all pleasant, quick, efficient, funny, and full of fun-filled personalities. You know they care about their service when the owners are back their making drinks and serving them, asking you if it's to your liking and offering to remake or alter it if not.The drinks: AMAZING. They have very basic items and very intricate drinks as well with quirky names and delicious flavors intermixed into the meaning of the name (if you put a bit of thought into it). Although I haven't tasted too much of the food, the wraps that I have eaten are also delicious with types ranging from breakfast to lunch, all complemented by a side of chips. If you're a Star Wars fan, look no further because this place is literally brimming with the a force of awesomeness. Overall, the atmosphere is light and positive, inviting and too enticing to resist. Personal favorite: THE SITH. It's a lovely dosage of espresso mixed with dark chocolate and coconut and just the right push you need to wake up in the morning. Don't knock it until you try it and when you try it, keep trying it. There's a reason they received the award for best coffee shop. Go check it out and see why!",

It's home without the comments about your weight or hair.  I go there quite a bit with my teaching partner to grade papers, plan lessons, and to restore my sanity and faith in humanity.  I also go there to write. Sometimes I just go there.  Mind you, I am driving from NLV, which is 3 time zones and a passport stamp away! So, the service is fantastic - courteous, caring, fast with a spare ipad or phone charger and I'm a blackberry girl, not so easy in an Apple world, but JJ comes through every time, Yeah, the service is fantastic.  But good service and mediocre coffee would lead me to cheat on them with God forbid, Starbucks. No, the drinks are great!  I can't recommend a particular item because for a long time only the owner could remember what I liked.  Now, I typically order off menu.  I name the flavors I am craving or the mood I'm in or the 7 riduculous things that were said to me that day and a magical drink is created! It is always delicious.  If it is not sheer perfection, it gets remade.  I even learned to drink chai there.   In addition to the liquid goodness, there are pastries and now wraps.  i am partial to the bagels. At GJ's, the food items come from local vendors and businesses, which I love! They have a drive through as well, but come inside.  You'll get connected too!",

And while it is still my go to and this is my first visit to Grouchy John's and he will have some making up to do, I have to say I was pretty blown away by the coffee and service!!    I was unsure of what to order. So many choices and combinations to choose from! ( they have their fav's- grouchy John, o.g., a.r.m., all of which get phenom reviews). But I decided on the butter-me-up, made with trader joe's cookie butter. Now I just have to say this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures on earth, but to find it put into an addiction of mine (lets just be honest here!)... Coffee??? SOLD!!!!  And the verdict is..... Delightful!! It wasn't too sweet, which I was worried about. I ordered it with whole milk but it didn't feel heavy at all. It was delish and I wish I had ordered the larger size!!    The service was great. There were a couple people behind the counter and a gentleman that walked around making sure everyone was happy. I assumed the owner and later asked and was correct! He asked twice if I had tasted my coffee yet and to let him know if I liked it and checked on me several times as I sat and enjoyed the vibe. The barista (girl with dark hair) also asked me. It was very nice to have such great service.    Now....On to the vibe of the joint. I really enjoyed it, but initially it threw me for this side of town I think. I seriously felt I was walking into a gamers room who is obsessed with star wars and may be out of town at a comic con convention. Very eclectic range of people hanging out, playing board games and on their computers.  Honestly,I could see this place downtown... but am more than thrilled that this piece of culturally diverseness found its way into my part of town!!! It's one of my biggest reasons for missing LA so much. Vegas lacks places like this!! I will be back!! Thanks Grouchy John.... Who isn't grouchy at all!! ;-)",

Lots of seating, WiFi and convenient freeway access makes this a new go-to for me. Definitely what put it over the top was the caring, personal service from the young man at the register. Offered a free sample of the herbal tea he recommended before I bought it. That doesn't happen at Starbucks.",

I drove all the way from North Summerlin (Lake Mead/Buffalo) just to try a drink called Shirley Temple of Doom based solely on the name alone. It's matcha green tea with maraschino cherries. Totally worth it. I ordered it iced and it barely lasted 5 minutes. I'm definitely going to return and try other drinks.",

It was a quality, well-made sandwich, on par with something I could make at home (as opposed to god knows what you're getting at McDonald's) but $5 is steeper than Sbucks.  Their rewards programs seems much more generous than Sbucks.  It's a standard stamp card, and it looks like after 10 or so stamps, I get a free coffee.",

It was a little sweet but not overly sweet, just the perfect amount.   The atmosphere is cool. They have a little nook in the corner that's filled with books. I didn't get a chance to check it out but I will next time I am there. There were plenty of little tables available for studying. I came during finals week so it was busy but not too crowded. I sat at one of the loungers and just relaxed for a while. The chair I sat in was a cute little leather sofa. From what I remember, it was a bit old with some tape on the arms but it was still super cozy! Definitely no complaints on my part.  Also, make sure you check in on yelp and give them your punch card cause they'll give you an extra punch! And a starburst candy :)",

Now matter where I drink smoothies or if I try to make them at home, I can't seem to find a place that does it better. I also love their Grouchy John's Frappe, it tastes better than any Frappuccino at Starbucks. Everyone now and then, I'll stop inside with friends and we'll all buy coffe and tea and play board games here. It's just an overall great place to chill at. And all the artwork at this place really adds to the atmosphere.  Additionally the employees here are always energetic  (maybe they drank too much coffee lol) and the owners are really fun to talk to too. I'm also grateful that the Grouchy John's truck comes to UNLV every now and then cause I don't have to drive to their coffee shop. Oh and got to love having a punchcard and all the free starburst they give me (it still confuses me to this day every time an employee hands me a starburst). Lastly, I want to thank Grouchy John's for sponsoring my Operation Smile Walk-a-thons at Silverado High School in the past by donating tons of coffee certificates.",

They also do as much as they can to give back to the community, which is amazing. Their menu provides a lot of options and their Mint Mocha Frappes are delicious.  I'm in Reno for school now and I can't wait to go visit when I'm back in town. Although, they will give you a hard time if you're a Wolf Pack fan ;)",

I tried the Mint Mocha frappucino (though I don't know if they call it that) and my wife had the carmel one. Both are excellent, reasonably priced, and if you check in on Yelp you get double stamps. With double stamps it takes about 5 trips to get a free drink - far better than Starbucks.  I'll definitely be back and love the location and how easy it is to get in and out of.

    "text": "Thank the coffee lords for Grouchy John's. These guys always seems to be conveniently located at Vegas events or 0.1 mile away from my house on Fridays. GJ coffee is always tasty or potent enough where I can enjoy the nourishment of the beans, not just water, some sweetener, and blackness. I would say prices are fairly reasonable for getting coffee that has care and... love lol. My favorite is the signature Grouchy John's Frappe which is white chocolate and amaretto flavoring, now if I could only convince them to give me real amaretto :).   Other notes:  - The guys are nice, friendly, and probably care about their job a whole lot more than your barista at Starbucks.   - Drinks come out fairly quick and efficiently, don't think I've ever waited more than 5 minutes for a drink.   - You can text order drinks ahead of time at (702) 608 - 5195  - You only need 5 stamps for their stamp card!  - Sometimes they do contest on twitter (@Grouchyjohns) for free drinks. Even I won once.   Creepy note:  I had a dream weeks ago that Grouchy John landed into heart of UNLV and grew its roots into the core of UNLV's soil making it a permanent resident Noneifying the need for Starbucks, Coffee Bean, and Einstein's... sadly it probably won't happen. Thus I will have to continue chasing Grouchy's around when I want some tasty coffee.",

It's so hard to find affordable, local places in Las Vegas so this is truly a hidden gem. 2. The service - the owners are here every day, and they're really personable guys who want you to have a good experience. The staff is super helpful. 3. The ambiance - Just go inside. You'll love it. 4. Starbursts! I still don't know why they give them out, but I'm not complaining.  My go to drinks are a simple nonfat latte (something I refuse to get at Starbucks because it's just not the same quality) and an iced chai with almond milk (another reason Grouchy John's wins), but really everything I've had here has been delicious. You're going to pay a little more than at Starbucks, but it's worth it.",

But even if you're not into that you can just hop on the good free wifi :) More importantly they have the best staff you could imagine. Super friendly, and more important super caring. I've watched them offer to remake drinks every single time someone expresses even the slighest dissatisfaction, and they go out of their way to find out if you are satisfied. On top of all that they have \"happy hour\" with half priced drinks both in the morning and the evening. They actually charged me $1.26 for a Sweet Arnie 20oz out the door. Un-fucking-believable!!!! They have a stamp card system too, where every 10 drinks gets you a free one (and there are opportunities for double stamping).  End of the day it all comes together at this place: tasty beverages and food served by awesome people in a very chill environment. COME HERE ALREADY!",

    "text": "When I was in college, I liked to consider myself a coffee house guru given that I had tried just about every single one in town within driving distance; and though Grouchy John's was about 15 minutes from my house- one of the furthest- I kept coming back because it was easily the best. Customer service was always grand and staff was always knowledgeable of their menu and able to make good recommendations. For me, some of the signature drinks like the Grouchy John are unfortunately just too sweet for my palate, but with a very wide variety and a willingness from staff and ownership to please, it is easy to find a beverage that you'll keep coming back to. And if you do not like your drink, whether it was made wrong or you just discovered it's not for you, they will remake it or give you something else to make you happy.  So for me, I recommend the Butter-Me-Up Late which is made with cookie butter but to me tastes like cereal milk if you're into that kind of thing. Also I love the Jedi and for a break from coffee, they make a superb apple cider with caramel and cinnamon add-ins if you like. Pastries, cookies, bagels, etc. are also delicious, but sometimes when they bring in merchandise from other shops in town it can be overpriced- but this makes sense considering the change of hands. That aside, this is one of the only places I know that really does cross-promote other local shops and bakeries in a wonderful way and Grouchy Johns seems to be the most involved in the community with their Thursday night networking (I forget the official name), clothing and toys drives, and more. Also, love the decor and their displays you can buy especially from local artist Tommy Vinci- very cool.  I would easily recommend this place to anyone. I used it primarily as a study ground, alone or with friends. The only thing is it is busy a lot of the time because it is really popular, so if you go there to study either bring headphones or adapt to a \"white noise\" environment. My only complaint is that I wish it could be open later more often for the night owls among us :) Maybe some day!",

The selections and ADORABLY named flavor parings (The Sith, The Jedi) make this place fun - the service and genuinely nice and happy employees make it a fixture.   I have not tried a pastry yet, they look amazing but incredibly heavy for an early morning start. Board games and books on the shelves, comic book art and signage on the walls.   There are frequency cards that we'll be taking advantage of in the future, and the drive-through has very fast service. If only it weren't more than 5 miles away from our route, but it's a sacrifice we'll have to make for a great morning coffee!",

Even during the summer months in Vegas, coffee should be hot and should be served intravenously.  Out at the inaugural Saturday Night Truckstop, and trying some new (to me) food truck yumminess, I needed something to wash it all down. It was hot, I was full, and I had absolutely no idea what I wanted.  Trying to help me decide, they asked me some questions. The technical bits went something like this:  \"Do you like [flavor, flavor, flavor, sweet, savory, this, that, and the other; and what type of milk]?\"  \"Um, yes, yes, not really, no, not too sweet, um, sure, maybe, and nonfat, please?\"  (Forgive the paraphrasing.)  What I ended up with was an iced, amaretto-flavored espresso drink (I even took the whipped cream) that I absolutely loved.  Not too sweet, heavy on the coffee without going overboard, and none of that weird syrupy aftertaste that flavored drinks often end with.   I'm a coffee person, no doubt about it, and Grouchy John's has a new fan for sure!",

The coffee is excellent and they reward their regulars with an 11th coffee free stamp card, double stamps for check ins at the location, and discounts if you bring your own cup. The drive thru is quick and well staffed. The inside has a huge collection of books, games, and art. The only thing I would change is to make them stay open later.

There's a wide range of people that I've noticed coming in mid day during my lunch breaks; from elementary school kids to work professionals, to newspaper reading elders, and everything in between.

It's worth the 10 minute drive to find coffee that doesn't start with 'S' and end in 'Bucks'. The coffee was really good here, although I am docking one star because I feel the drinks are prepared a little on the sweet side (I came here three times, during our stay, so I feel I had a pretty good feel for what they serve) But, it was good coffee as I said.  Service is outstanding! These people are eager to please! (so confusing considering the name!) Always friendly faces, and they even remade my husbands smoothie like 3 times to make sure he was happy with it (again, main problem was the sweetness...) Anyways, I wish we had a coffee shop like that in PHX!  Love the interior, it definitely has a coffee shop feel, and you can tell it's quite popular as it was always packed the days that we came in.   This coffee shop is definitely now on our 'places-not-to-miss' list whenever we go to Vegas. OH! btw, when you check in, you get double stamps on their card! I actually earned a free drink while we were there for only 3 days!",

As for the coffee,  it's good, slightly above average and hits the spot after a night of trying to get your teething baby to sleep.   If your in the hood, want a safe place to enjoy a cup then this is your spot. Strangely however they don't serve donuts. They probably should with how many uniforms and badges are always in there.",

Destination: Grouchy John's.   I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for far too long. I felt like a kid on my way to the candy store driving to GJ's. I walked in, was greeted with several hellos and a sea of MacBooks. There's a bookshelf with books, magazines, and board games. The walls were decorated with local art (which is available for purchase). There's also ample seating and free wi-fi; what more do you need in a coffee shop?  Stating that this was my maiden voyage to the shop, I got the full run down on their coffees, teas, sandwiches, wraps, snacks and treats. She also said that ANY time you check-in on social media, you get double stamps (10 stamps, free drink).   I decided to get a GJ special called the Honey Boo Boo - a combination of honey and vanilla. My card was swiped, the register screen swiveled towards me, there was an option to leave a tip (THANK YOU, I was sans cash), and was handed my receipt, a GJ stamp card, and pink Starburst. I've never thought of honey and coffee being friends (I was a barista for 5 years during college).  This combination was amazing. Perfectly balanced, sweet, and a totally new coffee experience and taste! My latte also arrived with the quickness and I was on my way back to the West side.  Well done, Grouchy John's. I don't understand why you're a grumpy gills when you're serving out pure bliss! Can't wait to go back!",

Lattes, teas, and smoothies, as well as some snack options like bagels and donuts (Pink Box!!). My personal favorites are the Rushmore and Butterbeer Latte. Sencha when I'm feeling some tea~  Atmosphere: The shop is very warm and inviting. The walls are filled with artwork from local artists and are available for purchase.

He really creates a friendly, happy, neighborhood atmosphere. Either he or another barista usually come around every 45 minutes to an hour checking up on everyone and offering water and refills.   Also they have almond milk! My favorite order is their honey latte - just enough flavor to complement the espresso but not so sweet you can't taste the almond milk. They also offer a bunch of frappes and creative concoctions for those so inclined.   If the drinks aren't motivation enough (which they totally are!), Grouchy John's has free Wi-fi, TONS of books to browse, and you get a couple of free starbursts with each order.   My Vegas/Henderson go to! Great place to spend a weekend morning, or afternoon, or evening! Anytime really. With a drive through, there is really no excuse not to stop by for a latte.   I think they started to introduce some quick and easy food items to their menu (in addition to the pastries, muffins, and bagels), so I'm excited to see what else they will begin to offer.",

On my way to my hotel, \"The Mirage,\" I decided to stop by Grouchy John's Coffee Shop since I was in the area and I heard a lot of good feedback from my fellow Yelp buddies. So, I used the GPS on my cell and viola, it was only 7 minutes away from where I was. Walking inside the Coffee Shop, there was a Grouchy John mobile with Vegas news anchors on the outside.   Grouchy John's is not like Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. It has that Mom and Pop feel (Non Commercialized), that I appreciate and wish we had more around the city. The decor was very fun to look at and they offered games and have special events scheduled.  **Checking in on your Yelp = 2 Stamps on your Grouchy John Coffee Card**  I ordered the Chai Tea Latte and a large donut from JJ (Melon Head), he had excellent customer service and was willing to answer any questions since I was a first time customer.  What surprised me was, they had a drive thru around and I didn't know until I saw a drive thru window by the register. Pretty neat in my opinion for a Mom and Pop Coffee Shop. JJ also threw in 3 starbursts while I waited for my coffee, that was a first for me. =)   Overall, my latte tasted excellent and the donut was delicious. You can sit on the media bar and enjoy your coffee or whatever while looking at small parts of the Vegas strip. Grouchy John has won me a return customer and I can't wait to come back and buy me a G.J. Coffee Mug Collection.   LOL!",

Good drinks, good service, free wifi, a movie playing daily, huge book trade sections, games, and my favorite part: an outlet at every seat so people like me who waste hours in a coffee shop on a laptop can stay charged with coffee while our computers stay charged via power-cord!",

They are good at making suggestions and the blended drinks are awesome.  I tend to study here and every time I've been it's been a calm, comfortable atmosphere.  They even have a punch card to earn free drinks and a full bookshelf to borrow from:).  This is definitely my happy place to relax, study, or meet up with people to chat.  Also, if you like Star Wars, you'll enjoy a lot of the decor here :).",

Grouchy is about an antithetical a name as I could come up with for the owners and staff of this coffe shop (albeit, I have not seen any of them before their morning brew).  John and JJ are fantastically friendly and entertaining, and this family friendly atmosphere that they've created seems like a great fit for the neighborhood.  Don't expect to find the too-cool-for-school brooding hipster barristas that ignore you here.  If you're looking for that vibe, go elsewhere.  But, if you want a great place to chill, play a game (they've got plenty), read a book, snack on some locally made munchies (they support local cooks and bakers), and generally improve your outlook on life, here's your spot.  They take pride in the quality of their product.  No overly burned coffee here!  I find the sweetened drinks (mocha, etc.) generally too sweet, so I order half sweet.  I don't remember the name, but there is a fruity-floral aroma black tea that is some of the best iced tea I've ever had in my life.  Grouchy definitely brightens my day.",

Free wifi and a ton of space.  The coffee prices are affordable. I paid $3.25 for a large iced coffee! The shakes, however, are a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. I ordered Matcha Green Tea shake and wasn't too excited about it.   Normally, I'd take a star off, but the service at this place makes up for it. The owner is super casual and engaging with his customers. He comes by each and everyone's table to see if they want anything else or if they want a cup of water. Love this local feel they're going for -- it really adds a personal touch.  Overall, this place is pretty dope. They have a lot of artwork on the wall too, which gives this place a lot more personality,",

    "text": "SUPPORTING A LOCAL BUSINESS  It's been two years since I first reviewed Grouchy John's and, back in 2013, I hadn't even been to the shop.  Since then, I've made several visits, many most recently.  I don't live near the shop, but it's worth the drive when I'm in the area.  CAFFEINE AND CANVAS nights with Tommy Vinci are what started me coming back to GJ's.  Just like the wine and paint places that you find around town, once a month local artist Tommy Vinci will teach you how to paint a scene of his choosing and make you feel like you know what you're doing.  $35 covers your art supplies (paint and canvas) plus any GJ's drink and pastry.  I've gone twice so far and it was a fun two hours each time.  I can't wait to go back when my schedule allows again.  Highly recommended for a night out with your friends.  Check the GJs Facebook page or Tommy Vinci's page to find out when the next class is and you can register online.  My favorite drinks are the HONEY LATTE and the YODA SMOOTHIE.   I like the fact that I can have almond milk for the lattes and the Yoda Smoothie is a refreshing green (of course) drink made with kale, spinach, pineapple, strawberries, and mango.  CUSTOMER SERVICE is always friendly and the hours are nice for early mornings.  Yes, some people have to be up at the crack of dawn and coffee or tea can be a necessity.  GJ's opens at 5:00am, Monday through Friday, and 7:00am on the weekends.  Closing time all week is 8:00pm.  The atmosphere is always very relaxed and you can hang out on the couches or at a table enjoying your drink.  The staff has always checked on me to ensure that everything is to my liking.  STAMP CARDS:  Buy 10 drinks and the 11th is on the house.  If you use your Yelp app to check-in, you get an extra stamp.    THEY GIVE BACK:  On their recent 3rd anniversary, GJ's collected donations for charity and had a blood mobile in the parking lot.  I went after work, donated blood, and there was free birthday cake available for customers.  Not to mention that I also received two free drinks in exchange for donating.  I love to support a business that in turn supports its community.  And lastly, GEOFF the resident gnome sits on the counter to greet everyone.  I love him because he is never in a bad mood and he treats everyone the same, whether they're grouchy or not.",

We came in for an afternoon pick me up after some hardcore hiking in Red Rock Canyon (ok, it was mainly driving and taking pictures, but that's hard work too!)  The place was PACKED! There were folks typing away on their computers, chatting with friends on the couches and an elderly gentleman in a captains suit. I'll say it...I love this old man. He had some super young lady taking care of him - and lets just hope it was his nanny.  Anyways...the coffee was great! It was the holidays so we got egg nog lattes! WHOA! These were so good! Just enough egg nog so you still taste the coffee and some nice cinnamon flavor....ah, the taste of the holidays!   Keeping up with the seasonal items we got a pumpkin cream cheese muffin. WOWZERS! This was delicious. I usually don't like pumpkin anything (except pie) but this was incredible. The cream cheese frosting was delicious and it was a nice snack to share with the wife - good size!  We sat outside in the cold - because, well we were tourists of course. They have a nice little setup with a table so you can sit outside. Super nice staff and overall a great place to grab a coffee. We meant to make it back before we left, but didn't have time unfortunatly. There's always next time!",

I poured about half my coffee into it to tone down the sweetness. It was perfect. I also had the PBM which was also blended as well and super tasty. Today along with my coffee and sandwich I'm enjoying the caramel mocha. Not gross at all. If you just want your black coffee, or a fancy beverage, this is a wonderful choice!",

They have 2 rooms: one more quiet and coffee-shoppy (that's a word), and one large one for gathering, playing board games, reading books (they have shelves full!), whatever! I love the large room because I feel comfortable bringing my kids without feeling like we are ruining the mood.   The menu is yummy! I love their smoothies and coffees, both are vegan friendly, and they started making vegan banana blueberry muffins which are darn good.   They support local artists, displaying art for sale all over the walls.   Overall its a groovy and happy place!",

I pass by it everyday as I was craving for a blended coffee drink, first I headed to Dutch bros, and I decided that the line was too long and I should just try Grouchy Johns.   Let me tell you this, I do not regret leaving Dutch bros, I asked the guy what was the best drink and he said Butter me up frap. So I ordered that and I saw they had butter beer too so I definitely had to get that too!   The drinks were mouth watering good!!! I did not want to stop drinking it on the way home And I can't wait to try my turkey wrap too .   I'm definitely coming back for drinks ! If you don't want to wait all day long, come here!",

I just so happened to be in search of a smoothie and this place popped up. How convenient that this eclectic shop was Star Wars themed. They also have plenty of comfortable seating near the front and a quiet back area with a bookshelf filled with comics.   I ordered the *Yoda* 20oz. smoothie because how could I not? I opted to add honey versus the agave. This was $6.75 and had kale, spinach, pineapple, strawberry and mango. The presence of kale may have sounded questionable, but the smoothie was delicious! The addition of honey may have helped mute the bitterness from the kale. What a neat spot to discover. As a note, I didn't realize it at the time, but they seem to have a Butter Beer Latte on the specialty menu... wish I had noticed that!",

It seems they are more interested in pushing buttons than listening to the order.   In the past, there have also been problems with food particles left on the containers. And today all that happened and more. She brought the containers to the window with her gloved hands covered in food (glad she wore gloves), which means the containers also had food all over them. I mentioned it, and she handed them to me and said \"There you go.\" When I asked for napkins to clean up the mess, \"Oh sure\" she said, \"There you go.\"   Shame on me for not asking for salt and pepper on the side, because the food tasted and smelled like it had been stored in a metal can. If that wasn't bad enough, I took one gulp and realized my steamer wasn't a steamer but coffee.  This is after she said at least 3 times, \"That's 2 steamers and 2 sandwiches right?\"  Makes me wonder if I had almond milk like I asked for.  So caffeine sensitivities and milk allergies don't count I guess.    Totally disappointed.",

    "text": "A COFFEE FAIRY TALE  Once upon a time, there was a magic elixir known as \"coffee.\" People far and wide loved and revered this elixir for its taste and it magical ability to keep them awake at all hours of the day and night.  Then, an evil mermaid came along and built coffee shops every 200 feet. She decided to produce coffee that was often burnt tasting. To cover up the poor coffee, the mermaid loaded up her drinks with sugary syrups that masked any taste at all. The result? Carb-loaded beverages that tasted nothing like coffee. And she laughed her evil laugh while sucking money out of her victims' wallets like some demented cross between a Dyson and a $10 hooker with poor taste in coffee.  But in a small hamlet known as Henderson lived a valiant errant knight named Sir John of Grouchy who declared that it was indeed possible to not only have delicious coffee, but to offer a menu filled with flavored coffees, milkshakes, frappes and magical bunny rabbits where not only could you taste the individual flavors but still taste the actual coffee that went into it.    (EDITOR'S NOTE: Though we haven't specifically seen the magical bunnies on the menu, we're relatively sure they're hidden there somewhere. We also assume that although Sir John is grouchy, it's unlikely he would serve up bunny rabbits for consumption and they are likely only on the menu to distract small children while their parents imbibe tasty beverages.)   In late August of 2015, this knight brought forth a pumpkin spice frappe that was not only made with real pumpkin (not just some sugary syrup), but was so cleverly balanced in flavor that the coffee was still the front-and-center item to be celebrated. A single sip of this frappe introduced the individual flavors of pumpkin, coffee and cinnamon to the tongue with not a single flavor overpowering the others. A glorious treasure to behold.  A sampling of other items from Sir John of Grouchy's menu revealed that this clever balancing of flavors was successful across a myriad of coffee-related and non-coffee-related items. And thus, the balance and harmony of the elixir \"coffee\" was returned to the kingdom and Sir John was held in extremely high esteem by hundreds and hundreds of coffee enthusiasts, among them this fairy tale writer.  Although the evil mermaid continues her stranglehold on the fair citizens of the desert and much of the rest of the world, Sir John of Grouchy continues to hold his Sword of Coffee Excellence aloft and fights a valiant battle daily against this force of evil. Only we, the faithful following, can ensure that Sir John emerges victorious in his quest.  The End (EDITOR'S NOTE: Well, not really the end. The store's open seven days a week. So you could technically go any day you want and that wouldn't be the end. Unless you moved away. But even then that wouldn't be the end because you could always visit. But you know what we mean.)",

I ordered an iced decaf almond milk, you guys do it right.  I love that you have two sitting rooms, and the front one is eclectic and fun. The tables are very close together so if you are going to tell a juicy story you may want to wait. Room two was larger. Both rooms were filled with people and they were all plugged in, it is great they have outlets to keep everyone charged with coffee and electronics. There is a little part of me that would like to unplug everyone and interact with people but that seems to be everywhere.  There is outside seating and I saw a filled water bowl for the four legged friends!",

I got a blended Jedi (which is white chocolate and coconut granita) it was so insanely sweet! I have quite the sweet tooth, but it was almost too much for me to handle. My friend got the O.G.

They have tons of seating so it's a great place to meet up with a few friends. You can even borrow some card or board games to pass the time.   I really like that it's a local coffee spot but It also has a drive through! As a mom, I find this really convenient because I don't have to unpack my daughter, wrestle with her while I order, then pack her back up. Before I found this place, convenience pretty much forced me to drink burned bean coffee at one of the larger chains.   Definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",

The prices were simple (I love it when places round to the dollar) and affordable. I got a soy iced latte, which was pretty darn good.  The coffee beans they use are very different than what I'm used to...It's more earthy, I would say. I think I like it! The coffee taste is not too strong and not bitter at all, but the drink was definitely not weak or watery.  The decor is very inviting and I could see myself hanging out with friends, playing one of their numerous board games. However, I came here to study so I refrained from playing with all the little amenities they had.  I wanted to try one of their Yelp-famous grouchy cookies but the cashier said he had never heard of them. Strange...  Bonus points for hassle-free and very fast wifi! Too bad this place is so far from my house. Otherwise, I would definitely go more often.",

I have been a little under the weather lately due to a cold and while I was in the area running some errands, I stopped by Grouchy John's for a chai latte to ease my sore throat.   I didn't go inside, but instead went through their drive thru. I'm always a fan of having a drive thru option since I'm usually in a hurry or just want a quick drink for my ride. I have driven by this location on many occasions and finally made a point to stop by. The guy taking my order was very helpful. I had a few questions about the menu and he helped clear up any confusion and decide on my order. Better yet, they didn't treat me like a moron for not knowing all the coffee lingo. By the time I drove up to the window my drink was ready and I was on my way.   Definitely glad to utilize a locally-owned business for my chai tea needs. I'll definitely be back to check out some of their pastries and other drink options.",

They support the tech community, local musicians and performers, and have art events at the coffee shop.  Besides all the warm-fuzzies, the coffee is the best I have found in Vegas. A friend from San Francisco came out for a week. I took her to GJ's on the first morning and every morning after that she insisted we go by to get a drink. She tried something different every day, and said the coffee was like Blue Bottle coffee in SF, if that helps anyone.",

After a quick lunch at Slidin' Thru HQ, we decided to get some half-priced off drinks (with Slidin' Thru receipt) at Grouchy John's.   John was helpful in answering any questions I had. \"What ingredients go in the smoothies?\" \"How sweet are the smoothies?\" \"Is the Chai Tea Latte less sweet?\" I decided to get the Iced Chai Tea Latte (with non-fat milk) on the impression that it wasn't too sweet. With the receipt, our Iced Chai and Iced Coffee came out to $3.25. Talk about a great deal!   John handed us our drinks, along with two complimentary gummy candies. Who knew that small candies could make me so happy? I handed John $3.50 in hopes he would consider the $0.25 as a tip, but he returned the quarter back, saying we paid a quarter too much. That's an honest man!  As for the drinks? The Iced Coffee was nice and refreshing. The Iced Chai needed more spice and less sugar. Other than that, it was a refreshing drink to have on a hot summer day. If you see this truck around, make sure to stop on by!",

I ordered a nutella banana muffin, which was delicious! it was not heavy, but it was essentially a muffin with nutella frosting...nice combo.  Service. The two baristas were very helpful and generous with their  information. also, the place does have wi-fi, which helped me kill time for about an hr.

They brew using excellent beans and the coffee is always strong. I come here and get the same thing always, a large iced latte with two pumps of hazelnut and one pump of chocolate with whole milk. Try this drink! Something I made up and it is super addicting. I crave them all the time. They also have excellent pastries that they also source locally from places in town. The ambience inside is great also, not too stuffy like some trendy coffee shops like to do. Everyone is very friendly and always smiling. Overall it's everything you want a business to be.

My party ordered a few smoothies, of all which were great. The service was great, too, and I believe we only waited a few minutes for all our drinks to be ready. It's really awesome that a mobile place is able to put out this kind of service and quality, which also speaks to the higher quality of mobile food purveyors.   Going back to the smoothies, they were delicious. They were better than the ones I get from Tropical Smoothie all the time, and the service was a lot better too: really friendly, no-pressure, \"do you have any questions?\" approach that really invites you into a conversation. Great service.",

This south side location seems a bit isolated but it's actually with 5 mins of the Strip, the freeway, and other restaurants, bars and shops. What's great too is the park across the street. You can walk there! Woah... Is this Vegas?  The coffee drinks are creative and tasty. I first discovered Grouchy John through their coffee truck at a special event downtown. But their brick and mortar is way cooler. There's actually books and games for people to sit, play, read and socialize.   I'll be a regular here for sure! The sugar cookies from Tuff Cookie are very cute. Any little girl- and at least one big girl (me)- will love these.",

    "text": "Really cool coffee shop.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Starbucks; but going to a non-chain coffee shop just feels better, and gives me a more genuine experience. It also reminds me a lot of the Bay Area, i.e., a world where both homogenized coffee AND more intimidate, community-feel shops can co-exist.   I had the \"Grouchy John,\" which is a white chocolate and amaretto latte. As a person that LOVES \"sweet\" coffee, this was heaven!  They offer five other coffee specialties.  The shop also offers pastries and the muffaletta sandwich from Bread & Butter in Henderson (which is also delicious).  Oooooh, so many good things!   The place has about nine two-person tables, and a couple of couches.  There's a couple of bookshelves, with a wide variety of books (and \"good\" titles), and board games (scrabble, yahtzee, etc.).  Two other things I love: it's a comfortable temperature inside, i.e., the A/C is not kicked into overdrive, and the music isn't too loud. This means I can actually read or have a conversation in relative peace. Oh yeah, the staff is really friendly (ok, so that's three things).   Last tip: if you tell them you do reviews on an online social media site, you get an extra stamp on the frequent flier punchcard. Yee haw!!!",

If you're feeling adventurous, just let John create a custom drink for you. Trust me it'll be tasty. You'll also get a chance to name your own drink and get it up on the menu!  Grouchy John's is also very active on Facebook and Twitter so if you have any questions or comments, you know you'll receive a quick response.  As a bonus, if you have an iPhone you can download Square's Card Case app and just pay with your phone!  I'm on a mission to create my own custom drink so be on the lookout for \"The Shewchuk\"",

Starbucks is boring, so we decided to try Grouchy John's because a friend is addicted to this place and highly recommended it.  I originally asked for a Strawberry/Banana Smoothie, but the guy at the register suggested I try the Suicide Smoothie instead. I went with his recommendation. The drink was good, but nothing special. I'd rather have Jamba Juice to be honest. Maybe I messed up by ordering a smoothie at a coffee shop, so I'll venture into the coffee items next time I'm here.  Rather than the drinks, the highlight was the atmosphere. The place is fairly quiet, but not stale like a library. It does have an artsy feel. Not in a skinny jeans and PBR hipster type of way though. Nerdy and comfy would be the best way to describe it. This gives it the character that's lacking at the chain coffee shops. Best of all, their tip jar has a sense of humor.",

The girl who took my order was very knowledgeable and helpful in making a recommendation. I got the cold brewed coffee, iced, to-go, and the girl mentioned I can can a refill too. That's good to know. Even though I got a small, it was plenty strong so didn't get a refill on my way out. Coffee was smooth and tasty.

    "text": "Do you want really good coffee, but don't want the run-of-the-mill Starbucks option? Then Grouchy John's Coffee Shop should be bookmarked if you haven't given it a try yet. It's near the Windmill Ln. exit off of the 215.  They have a small-ish private parking lot and a drive-thru for those of you who don't want to get out of your car or for those commuters trying to satisfy their coffee fix on the go.   Let's talk about ambience. It's not really a coffee shop worth going into if the interior isn't cool-looking. Grouchy John's paint was bright, fun, and made you want to look at what's painted on the walls closely. The wall decorations were super cool looking, too (with a bunch of Star Wars-related things for all you George Lucas fanatics)!  The staff was friendly. After my cousin and I were staring at the menu for a while, they told us they had a specialties menu just in front of the register (which is cool because it's less thinking for me -- I just have to pick the drink that sounds like it'll taste good LOL).  I ended up picking the \"Serenity.\" It's advertised as: white chocolate, peppermint, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle. You could also get it served hot, iced, or blended. OH! And if you don't think they give you enough options already, they throw the \"what kind of milk?\" option at you. I looked at her kinda surprised at first because they usually never ask me that at coffee shops (I'm not really picky, either), but as she went on listing the types of milk I just had to go with the almond milk. BIG plus for having almond milk, by the way.  Anyway, the Serenity with the almond milk hit the spot! The name for the drink really did it justice because I was less grouchy after a couple sips. It was smooth. It had a very rich, creamy taste that only was complimented with the nutty almond-y goodness. The peppermint gave it a little bit of a zing. You know, like the coolness you get in your mouth after eating a peppermint patty. I feel like this drink will be the best drink for cold weather. It's definitely more of a winter holiday drink, but it's still pretty amazing anytime of the year!  With the amount of options here, it's worth the trip to try. Bring friends (and maybe play their board games they have out), catch up on some work, socialize, or sit by yourself and read/watch TV -- you can do it all here while enjoying some pretty astounding coffee!",

I first saw this place on Google Maps after heading to work at 2am and seeing that everything else but GJC was open 24 hours so I head over there! I quickly get attended by a employee and he recommended the OG if it was my first time there, if I didn't want that then they'll do their best to accommodate what I was looking for. Not wanting to be a hassle I order a OG and boy was it amazing! Just the perfect amount of coffee and sugar to wake me up. Over the past few months I've tried most of their menu still being impressed how good it is. Easily one of my favorite coffee shops.",

Perusing the menu, they even got items named after Star Wars  characters. Can you say SUH-WEET!?!?  It was pretty packed when we got  there, but  after searching high and low,  we got a little table right below the  AT-AT. Continuing the Star Wars theme, I ordered a Jedi which was pretty good, but flavor wise seemed to be missing something. Service was great though...Oh, and the artwork on the walls and expansion through the hallway were cool too!  I'll probably give Grouchy John's another shot if I'm in the area, but I'm not in a hurry to return though. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter : \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu. 3.75",

Drinks came out quickly and were fantastic! Great quality coffee, blended well, all is good. The shop is fun, tons of seating, board games, great place to hang out.

The lattes are a bit on the dessert side of sweet, personal adjustments can be made as the staff is awesome and accommodates the request.   The coffee isn't bitter and doesn't leave any funky aftertaste, important for the folks who don't like coffee, but like the idea of caffeine (may sound weird, but I have had many conversations with people about hating coffee and drinking espresso drinks?)   I have had a few different flavors so far in both hot, iced and blended. I can tell you that as long as you like the flavor you select it won't be disappointing at all.  Blended options which are amazing \"Evil Monkey\" and \"Curious George\" both give you an amazing banana experience and each with a different style or twist. My favorite would be the \"Grouchy John\" but I would definitely reduce the level of sweet unless you have a total sweet tooth. I enjoy the kick of the espresso and therefore I do half sweet and add a shot.  All in all the atmosphere is great, this place has a bunch of cool local art on display and for sale, they work with local charities which is amazing and makes this place great for the local community. They have tons of regulars, they clearly make a mean coffee drink and make many feel at home.  If you love coffee, make a pit stop here!",

I love it blended (Frappuccino style), but mainly to say to the barista \"may I have a blended arm\"!   Today I had it hot and it was on par and just as funny to say \"may I please have a hot arm\".  I have to say hot or blended, the A.R.M. taste amazing.  Think chocolate covered almonds in a coffee!  The flavor is great and the drink wasn't excessively hot.  I recommend giving your favorite coffee drink a try at this spot!  Hot, cold or blended, you will be pleasantly surprised with the flavor!  Please disregard the photo, they specialize in coffee not the designs on the cups.  What's inside is what I went there for and it was AMAZING!",

    "text": "This is a great little local coffee store. People gather here in small groups frequently because the atmosphere is so chill and inviting.  Today a man just accosted an employee over a \"No Bills Over $20\" sign on the counter. He was CLEARLY confrontational and looking for a fight. All the employee said back to the man was, \"Then don't look at it.\" This just infuriated the man and I'm here watching the whole thing go down. If the man was that offended by the sign, then he should just leave and go to a different business. Yelling at employees doesn't really work. There is absolutely nothing rude about a sign telling customers about the payment policy in their business. I think the employee did a fine job telling the man the reason why the the sign was there. Yet the man kept on saying comments back to the employee, trying to get him to continue the verbal confrontation. He told the employee he was going to get him fired. All over his comment that the man started about a sign over $20.00 bills!",

Coffee is mediocre, but unlike what I've seen on the advertising and promotional ads, I've never been offered a ceramic coffee cup to spare our landfills. They have board games, which is great because why watch live media, sports and entertainment when you can play the 1971 board game 'Mystery Date'? Who has the time? \"Did you get formula and diapers for the baby?\" \"Uh...sorry, no, I was playing Stratego at Grouchy John's.\" Best thing about GJ's is their apple fritters. Good night Irene. They are so freaking good, but will seriously increase your mortality. My life insurance company dropped me after they found out I ate one.   Worst thing about GJ's is how chatty and loud the staff can be at 5:05 AM. I just woke up, and am easing myself into consciousness, and they're yakking away. I get it. Coffee shops don't pay squat, but, you can have all the free joe you can handle, until the resting heart rate of the entire staff makes the average hummingbird's heart rate seem that of an African elephant (12-15 thuds a minute). Just keep it quiet at least until the Dow Jones bell has clanged.",

You usually get one of those stamp cards (10 stamps = one free drink) at boba shops, but It is pretty rare to find a coffee shop like Grouchy John's Coffee that actually offers stamp card with a special twist ... you also get one extra free stamp with the Yelp check-in deal (basically one order = double stamps.) The coffee menu has tons of coffee options, but I think there are simply too many options under the \"specialties\" section (I had a hard time deciding what I want and not to mention the menu doesn't clear label full prices for each specialty coffee) and the staff said top three drinks (Grouchy John, A.R.M. [almond roca mocha], and OG [salted caramel & vanilla]) are the most popular specialties.  ***  Grouchy John (White Chocolate & Amaretto): Personally the drink was a little too sweet for my taste and I ultimately did not finish the entire drink.  ***  Overall it was just an a-okay coffee and I still prefer coffees from Sunrise Coffee and Desert Wind Coffee Roasters.  P.S. - There is another location in the Westside.",

The environment is well maintained and makes you just want to be there and enjoy yourself.  They have board games and books to choose from with plenty of space.

I must say there isn't a single bad one, theyre all delicious in both their hot and blended forms. They have limited food options but what they have is more than enough. I can eat their wraps for days and yes, you can add avocado. Don't even get me started on the pastries, so good if I don't stop myself I'd have to be rolled out of there sooner or later.  As a general chill spot, Grouchy's also walks away with 5 stars. They boast a large seating area with filled with many board games. It goes without saying but with so many people coming in and out, a lot of the games are missing pieces. If youre planning a group visit to play, be prepared to set some new house rules to make due with what you have.",

I have also had the pumpkin spice latte, which truly was the best pumpkin spice latte drink I've ever had (obviously better than big chains).   The turkey wrap I got was amazing too, with fresh bell peppers, spring mix lettuce greens, tomato, cheddar cheese and honey mustard. It was so fresh and made to order. They even wrapped it in plastic wrap for me upon request so that I could take it through airport security to have for dinner later!  I also love the comfy chairs in the back, there's plenty of seating and cozy bookshelves everywhere. It feels like my home away from home. The servers/baristas are super friendly and nice. This place is also affordable and not a rip off. I guess I can't say enough good things about it! When I'm ever back in Vegas, this place will be my first stop.",

Grouchy John's uses coffee beans that are medium roast (not French roast or burnt like Starbucks beans).  After they grind the bean down, they brew up a strong tasting and flavorful cup of joe.  Thumbs up.  The espresso drinks are great too.  The honey latte is my favorite, offering a sweet steamed milk drink with a sweetness falling between a mocha and a latte.  The honey provides a nice sweetness, but not so much that the taste of the espresso is drowned away.  Love it.  The mocha should be celebrated as well--for those nights when you want a hot chocolate, but also need a pick up--it's delicious.  Finally, the truck offers great customer service.  The guys running the truck always seem to be in good spirits and crank out the drinks quickly.",

    "text": "There's nothing like starting your day off with a hot, delicious beverage from a mobile coffee truck that doesn't deliver side a grouchiness with your order.   I started my Monday morning off by ordering a Caffe Latte for myself and a regular coffee for a co-worker, whom I excitedly dragged with me to the truck. I ordered my Caffe Latte without any sweeteners or other flavorings, and I enjoyed the little jolts with each sip I took and all the frothiness that settled around the inside of my cup (mmm!).  My co-worker said the coffee wasn't bad, but hands down did he prefer Grouchy's over the brew in our office.   After confessing to the cool guys who were manning the truck that I've been waiting for their arrival ever since the previous week (sound stalker enough?), and that I've never tried Grouchy John's Coffee, they gave me two stamp cards and stamped one card full with happy face stamps!   Aside from the fantastic service, the caffeine buzzes, and stamp cards(!), I must note that I also enjoyed seeing a small Darth Vader figurine by the tip jar (the truck's \"guardian\" as I was told), as well as a few items on their menu with titles inspired by characters from Star Wars -- this created a stir of excitement among some of the predominantly IT employees who were present, including myself. I'll have to stalk the truck again to try those Star Wars titled beverages next time and write an update on this review.   Grouchy John's easily receives 5-Stars from me.  Now, go forth and try Grouchy John's Coffee! May The Froth Be With You!",

I was unsure about what to expect with grouchy johns but was pleasantly surprised with the service and art work all over the walls from local artists (very cool) the problem I had was trying to order one of their ice drinks and had absolutely so clue what to order or what I was doing. I ended up just saying yes to everything and think I got whole milk with the peanut butter version drink. It was very good and I would get it again as long as I didn't have to order it.... I'm not sure why there are always 6 questions associated with every purchase these days but I suppose it's because people want options. Me? I want a peanut butter drink that's easy. Maybe if I become a regular I won't have to break down my order everytime.",

The guys at GJ are so friendly and helpful.  I enjoyed coming to this coffee shop.  On to the coffee, they are DELICIOUS!  You can order the drink hot, iced, or blended.  I had the Grouchy John hot and blended on two different occasions and they both are yummy.  I love the amaretto flavor in this cup of goodness.  I must say though that the hot tasted sweeter than the blended.  Either version, they were still yummy in my tummy with the right amount of caffeine and sugar kick.  I have also had the Almond Roca latte blended and it was very balanced.  Not too sweet...just right.  We also picked up the best cheese danish I have ever tasted, which is baked by Bread n Butter.  Oh boy, even someone on a Paleo diet must cheat once in a while to taste this melt in your mouth cheese danish with a crispy flaky tart shell.  Oh so good..  I also love the concept of dropping $2 in the bucket, fill up a cup with hot coffee, and leave.  I noticed this on the first morning I visited this coffee shop.    Additionally, the stamp card is a plus and when you check into GJ, you get DOUBLE stamps for each drink, which is a super duper yelpy plus :)  I can confidently say Adios Starbucks...Hello Grouchy John!",

I liked that they were able to make it light on the sweetener too. I also ordered their cheddar bagel, it was fresh and doughy--more yum.  The only negative for me is that their biggest coffee cup is 16oz. No biggie, I'll order 2! Lol   The decor is fun! There's dozens of outlets to charge your gadgets. There's board games, books and cool art that's for sale. I liked the seating too, there's high tops, couches and hidden nooks (perfect for antisocial people like myself :-) ) ..ohh and free wifi! What's not to love?   The staff was upbeat and friendly. They were more than willing to describe their favorites and told me their top selling specialties to help me pick my poison ;-)  I got a club card with extra stamps for the yelp check in too! ---oh I will be back!",

When I used to live in Vegas years ago, I always felt there was an absolute lack of coffee shops.   This time around, there is a actually a variety of shops open in the area.    When we walked in, it was empty. The staff (and I believe one of the owners) immediately greeted us with a warm smile and a cheery \"Good Morning.\". These may be simple things to do but I have been to many a shop where this is not the norm!  I had already made up my mind that I wanted one the grouchy cookies but the owner pointed out that they also have a variety of doughnut's (SCORE!) from KD's doughnuts (a place I had also bookmarked).  He recommended the blueberry doughnut which I also I got. My lil bro went with a chocolate glazed doughnut. I chose the Grouchy latte which was white chocolate and almond syrup.   The blueberry doughnut was an amazing surprise!  It was moist and delicious and went perfectly with my drink. My brother enjoyed his doughnut and polished it off before I even noticed.   Not only do they have quality products here and friendly staff but they also do some other awesome stuff.  They had an area dedicated do donated items for kids in need of back to school supplies. And let me tell you, it was packed full of items. How awesome is that???  They also have a book/library program. The owner saw me eyeing the books and explained that I was welcome to take it and bring it back whenever I was done. He also said that I can do a book swap where in I could bring books from home and take some books I wanted. I almost wanted to cry because I DON'T LIVE HERE!  Grouchy John's-good on ya!",

    "text": "If I could give Grouchy John's more stars, I would. Let me tell you why.   I have been to GJ's about 5 times. My fiance and I were lucky to stumble across this gem of a local coffee shop on our way home from a weekend Vegas trip.   The atmosphere is awesome- think your neighborhood coffee shop- laid back, lots of games, comfy seating, and cheerful and unique decor.   The drink menu is huge- lots of creative drinks ranging from coffee based to tea to smoothies. Everything that I've ordered has been fresh and flavorful, whether it's just a plain black coffee or a house special drink. I personally love to order a plain coffee, a latte of some sorts- try the one with amaretto with soy milk- and the yoda- a green smoothie that is full of fresh fruit and veggies. Yep- three drinks in one order.   The best part of GJs is the service! We always make a point to stop in on our Vegas trips. The baristas are always extremely friendly, genuine, and ready to help. Drinks are freshly made and complimentary starbursts accompany them. Even though we aren't regulars, John remembers us!   One weekend we had to make a last minute decision to drive back to Phoenix because we couldn't find a place to stay. We decided to stop by GJs on the way home to get caffeinated for our 4.5 hour drive. We walked in 10 min before closing, the chairs were up and the floors were being mopped. I could tell the kitchen was just about clean and shut down, but John greeted us like we were regulars and invited us to place an order.  On top of that, I had a free drink from my frequent buyer card and he deducted the most expensive drink. He chatted with us while he made our drinks and treated us like old friends.   All of these interactions and experiences lent me to want to give GJs a high review. I remember wanting to give them a stellar review after my first visit and I am even more impressed that they keep exceeding my expectations! I wish I could go more often!",

They have a unique menu and I love it. Everything is made very well and the flavors are great. I like the ice blended items because they use like a certain ice that just has a different texture. I don't know if the makes sense, but there is no huge chucks of ice which I like. The ice blended items seem to be very smooth.  The flavor of the signature \"Grouchy John's\" is amaretto and vanilla I believe. It was a little too sweet for me. I like the OMG more but I think to each his own. I have a weird sense of the perfect sweet and too sweet though.  I really like this place and will probably go a number of times!",

Wait, we gotta be at the club ASAP before guest list closes!! But i look too ratchet to go INSIDE!\" ``````SOLUTION: GROUCHY JOHN'S DRIVE THRU (yes you read that correctly they have DRIVE THRU)  \"Starbucks is BORING\" ``````SOLUTION: GROUCHY JOHN'S  Prepare your body for the plethora of flavors they offer (horchata/almond roca/banana/just to name a few...). Trust me, you will be perplexed by their offerings.  My recent favorite: THE CHUPACABRA! Try it if you like chocolate with a pinch of spiciness!  Workers are nice, board games inside are abundant, free wifi...what can i say? This place is a nice unpretentious cafe that could be anyone's cup of tea.  ...or, ya know....coffee.",

Granted, we are not the type of people who call super sweet beverages \"coffee\" like a lot of the world these days. These drinks were just plain dessert in a cup, with espresso added as an afterthought (maybe? I didn't taste it). If that's what you're into, then head over here.

At every couch or chair they have an outlet ready for you to use! Just go order at the counter and pick a table. And while you wait or drink your coffee they also have books and board games. A major plus in my book.  I'd also like to note that this places thrives on customer service. Every person that has taken my order has been more than helpful in choosing what I drink. They always have a smile and if there was anything wrong with my drink the would change it for free!!  As for prep time the coffee always comes out quickly. For the taste of the coffee, I've never had a bad tasting coffee here. And if you were bored of a flavor here they always come up with new flavors!  Pro tip! They have some fast and easy to use wifi! I also like how this place always greets you as you come in and gives a goodbye when you leave.  If I could change anything about the though it would be their closing time! 8:00 is definitely a buzz-kill when I'm coming home from work :(",

The staff takes the time to explain the numerous beverages they offer. In addition, there is a stamp card system which rewards you with free drinks. I recommend their Americano for only $2. I will definitely be returning to their truck next semester, and look forward to visiting their stationary location.",

My favorites are the Grouchy John and the Cinnamon Dolce which I tried for the first time today and adore as a frap!

    "text": "Man, this weekend was full of checking out eclectic coffee shops.  The other day, I checked out Sunrise Coffee the other day and loved it.  A couple of buddies of mine, The 80's Kids, told me about this amazing place on Maryland called Grouchy John's.  I has a lot of work to catch up on and thought this was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of this Yelping opportunity.    I'm literally sitting in this joint writing this review.  It's located on the corner of Wigwam and Maryland Pkwy.  Brings back a few memories from when I used to live a couple of blocks away.  That was almost 6 years ago. You walk in and notice the vaulted ceilings, vibrant colors and eclectic artwork on the walls.  In fact, my buddies' artwork is displayed in this joint.  Walk by the orange back wall and you'll see the 80's Kids artwork.  In this joint, there are books of all kinds and a large screen TV. The staff is young and therefore, vibrant and hip!   I LOVE coffee shop vibes like this one.  Definitely an amazing place to hang out and do some work.   For my drink I got the 12 oz. Non fat Hazelnut Latter for $4.  The Barista even created foam art for me!  It was a cute leaf on the top.  The drink was a little sweet but not overpowering.  I loved that the espresso used was a little bitter, really working with the hazelnut flavor.  Definitely a great cup to go along with my work.    All in all, it's a great place to visit!  I love the nerdy, yet sophisticated vibe you get from this place.  I'm really starting to dig this type of ambiance when work is needed to get done on the weekend.  When I'm in this part of town again, I will certainly keep this place in mind.  Come check them out!",

The freshness of the coffee beans are as important as the blend or the machine that's pulling it etc.   Well....these guys use LOCALLY ROASTED ESPRESSO beans. The espresso shots are incredible. They are are truly perfect. Flavorful, rich, gobs of crema (which comes more from the freshness of the beans than anything else). If they served them out of the trunk of a Buick I'd still be a regular! But then the coffee shops insides are super cool too. Looking around for a coveted outlet, for example, I found (next to a worn in/comfy leather chair) a.....wait for it....power strip. Outlets galore!!  Well done, guys. This place truly \"get's it.\" Cheers.",

Although I tend to swing through the drive thru most days now, when I have time I try to stop and sit inside for a bit. When you first walk in you're greeted by a bunch of different art and memorabilia. There's basically a mini library in the main lobby and the back area has a ton of seating.  As for the staff they are top notch. They're all pretty unique and have great personalities. They go out of their way to make the experience a great one. The owners still work with the crew, and they're just as amazing. There have been multiple times I've seen an owner/manager attend to a customer or offer an unsolicited apology for something taking too long.  It's the way I'd imagine a small business to be run. It's a wonderful place and whether you're looking for a pit stop or need a new regular cafe, I highly recommend Grouchy John's.",

My favorite is the Butter Me Up, but all of them are amazing. I've honestly never had a bad drink.  I have recently been trying to watch my sugar, and if you're in the same boat I highly recommend the Skinny ARM. It's seriously amazing.. it doesn't taste skinny at all.

Their coffee is top notch... not bitter and has great flavor. I totally suggest following them on Facebook since they post daily and have in-store events frequently.  Plus it's super entertaining to see what is going on, who is doing what and what the specials are going on or what's coming up. They also have a mobile truck that goes to various locations and events around  town.... so you might see them out and about. SUPER nice folks here.

Their drink names and ingredients are so unique, it is rare to find a place like this. Don't get me started about their service, everyone that works here is ridiculously nice! They take really good care of you and constantly ask if you need water or anything else. I am so happy that their business is doing so well and is always expanding because they honestly deserve it!   [All of their drinks are amazing, but here are just a few favorites in case you need help deciding what to get]  Some of My Favorite Drinks: 1. The Grouchy John (My all-time favorite which consists of White Chocolate & Amaretto) 2. O.G. (Caramel, salt, & vanilla) 3. Curious George (Honey, banana)  Fun Facts: 1. If you love Star Wars, this is your coffee shop. Many of the drinks and decor are inspired by Star Wars. 2. Once a month Grouchy Johns does a canvas painting in the shop. 3. If you check in on Yelp, they'll give you 2 stamps on your punch card.  4. Every Monday, they have a 50% off drink.",

I was even surprised that they offered actual coffee mugs instead of paper cups to enjoy coffee when In-house.   In recent times, I am sad to say, this coffee shop has begin to feel more and more like a Starbucks. Despite having an expansion, I haven't had that warm feel as I had in the past, and it seems as though paper cups are now the norm.   3.5/5",

Now that Grouchy John's is located down the street, I can go for a stroll on a beautiful day to get my coffee.   On a Sunday afternoon, around 4pm, it was dead. For each guest, there was one employee. The customers looked to be regulars and I can see why. All the employees warmly greeted us and helped us along the way in making our decisions. I strayed away from my usual Americano and went with a specialty coffee. I got the A.R.M frappe. This blended drink is a mixture of almond roca and mocha flavorings. It is possible to make certain drinks sugar free and that was how I got mine. My friend got the Grouchy John special and it was too sweet for my taste. White chocolate and amaretto is a rich combination, but I would ask for the syrups to be cut down.   GJ has a good mix of tables for studying and couches for lounging. The leather cushioned chairs caused me to slouch into them. If only my yoga teacher could see me now. I would for sure get reprimanded. Laziness is definitely a side effect of this coffee shops comfy chairs.",

This place, Grouchy John's coffee shop  :) Don't let the name deter you people, this place is the real deal. Whether you're looking for a nice pastry (they get theirs from Bread-n-Butter, you can't argue with that), that cup of coffee or just somewhere to hang out on a hot or cold day, this place is a gem. Not only can you get all those things, this place also offers board games (free) and random books (free) that you can use while you're here. So, leave all your stuff at home and come use theirs.  I love a great coffee shop with an inviting atmosphere, especially when the service is there to match. Every time we've come here, the girls are always nice and friendly. There's usually an asian (I think) guy there that is always helpful. I ordered a bagel and he even bought it to my table for me. Now that's service.   However, be careful of the two men crew. We were there on a friday afternoon and the service was not all that. The guy that took my order didn't seem to care. I tipped him and he just looked at me like it wasn't enough. Not to mention he didn't even say thank you. When they called our order, we went to the counter to pick it up and again the other just looked at us, annoyed. This is the first time that we've had bad service here. I guess they're the ones that named the coffee shop :)  Ciao and until next time, happy drinking everyone :)",

J.J. has saved me every time, making recommendations and promising to swap it out if I'm not in love.   To date, there has been zero swaps.  I love this place.  It's comfy and fun....with fun cookies, fun art, fun forcefield activators by the register, fun games, fun books, and fun drinks.  I have a new favorite coffee shop in Vegas.  Today's A.R.M. was delicious...can't wait for tomorrow.    Sorry Sunrise.  Sorry Beat.  I've been grouched.",

    "text": "I was a groupie when it came to their food truck and would run and grab a cup of coffee when I was near their location. I always had a cheerful personality greet me and the coffee was always spot on. So of course I followed them on facebook and was doing my happy wiggle dance once I found out they will have a permanent place to call home. It took me awhile to actually make my way to their location since I live on the far NW part of town and rarely go into their neck of the woods. So one cold rainy day I was doing my errands and I got a wild notion to make that voyage and endulge in some caffeinated happiness. It sucks to look forward to something for so long, drive way out of my way to get that same love I received in the past to be treated like I was a annoyance. It wasn't a busy day at all otherwise I would let it go...no smile, no greeting, just looked right through me like I shouldn't be in here. I asked questions regarding the popcorn for sale...simple question...\"what flavor is this one?\" He gave a nice glare and told me the flavor is on the bottom of the cups and walked away :-/ ummm it's not very clearly mark I'm sorry to be such a pain in your of so busy day :-/ I moved out of state now so most likely I'll never come back. Hopefully they go back to the warm greetings I was use to before. Hopefully it was just a bad day and I happened to be on the receiving end. Either way my voyage left me kinda bitter that day.",

The service, selection of beverages, and overall environment are beyond what I expected from a small coffee shop. We decided to order an Iced Black-eye (iced coffee with two double shots), an iced Almond Roca Mocha with an added shot, and a blended Curious George( blended combo of coffee, honey, milk, and banana). Being our first time there and having an amazing menu to pick and choose from, the service from both associates was awesome in assisting us to pick from the selection. The flavor of the coffee and not having an overpowering sweetness from the ingredients included was very pleasing. Ive found that with most corporate establishments (not to say I don't appreciate a good Coffee Bean here or there) is the coffee itself gets lost behind all these added syrups, powders, or blatantly is not produced as rich as it could be, but Grouchy John's did it just right. Needless to say we enjoyed our selections beyond our expectations and the overall vibe and environment is very welcoming. I have to say if I was a student this would definitely be on my list of places to relax and study without the fuss and fight for a table or outlet. Thank you for the coffee, great service, and we look forward to enjoying more of the menu on our next Vegas trip.",

Friendly and efficient with a staff of baristas happy to engage the customer in banter about the myriad coffee concoctions or the day's events while satellite radio plays overhead and local art decorates the walls it was with some discussion that I eventually settled on \"The Jedi,\" and although generally a double espresso or Americano sort I have to admit the flavor profile and mouthfeel were perfect while sweetness was not overdone, a sometimes-lost art that I appreciate for allowing the quality of the beans to show.  Moving next to the baked goods, the fritter room temperature while the muffin was lightly warmed, and having been told subsequently that neither item is made in house I will simply say 'good' as the former was flavorless and dry while the later possessed the texture of a wet sponge - a shame considering the vast number of quality local bakeries from which they could be sourcing instead.",

If you're hanging out in the coffee shop, the employees will walk around once in a while to check on everyone, sometimes even giving free coffee refills and providing ice water. You really feel like you're in someone's home when you're at Grouchy John's, especially since there are so many awesome books and board games around to keep you busy if you're looking to spend your day or evening hanging out and sipping coffee with friends.    This place also has amazing donuts, but you have to get there early enough or they'll run out!   The coffee is great - my favorites are the Grouchy John's Latte and the Cookie Butter latte. Also, they have a wide variety of cold juices and smoothies if you're not in the mood for caffeine.   I like to sit here and study, people watch, read, listen to music, or just relax on my day off.  Locally owned coffee shops beat corporate coffee, always!",

However, grouchy johns just tops every coffee experience I have ever had, always amazing service, owner is always super nice and helpful and their coffee's are not only delicious but incredibly unique and have the best names. My personal favorite is a blended honey boo boo with an added shot. It's a blend of hazelnut and honey, super yummy!",

For some reason, this is the coffee shop where I manage to get the most work done. There's a good amount of outlets and the noise level has not been a problem.   My favorites from here are the butter me up latte made with cookie butter, the pbm, the nutella latte, and the mayan apocalypse! I recommend exploring their menu because their other drinks are just as delicious. And I've overheard their willingness to make you a new drink if you're not satisfied with what you received.   Staff is friendly and they even walk around to check up on you to make sure you're doing okay. In all, the atmosphere, the drinks, and the service are excellent. Grouchy John's a must-try for those who haven't yet.  Check in on yelp and get double stamps! After 10 stamps, get any drink, any size for free.",

Never have had many issues except the fact that every time it's always a different price and I always order the same exact thing. However, my last visit, I came to get the same order and gave the lady $20. I was waiting a bit for my receipt and change....Well I never got it. After a gentleman handed me my wraps, I pulled around to go inside to get my wraps and change. I ask the cashier for my change and receipt she in a very smart-alic voice, \" oh did I not give you your change? And laughs\"! She hands me a receipt for an order that wasn't mine, it was for a car that paid with a card. I inform her it wasn't my receipt and she starts scrambling. She right than and there, rings up my order and gives me my receipt and change. With her being under pressure, she rang it up wrong. I think this lady thought I was an idiot but I work in customer service I know she was pocketing my $20 and not ringing it up in the register. I wonder how many other customers she has ripped off and how many times she's been stealing from the owner?!",

We have becoming regulars here at Grouchy John, at the Maryland location, (they also have a mobile location that I see at UNLV), we are so glad that we gave this place a try, and you should too.  The atmosphere of the place is very warm and cozy. There are a lot of local art works along the walls and they has a very warm, relaxing tone, so you can actually come here and knock out a few homework or studies here and there while enjoying a hot cup of coffee.  The quality of the coffee is very rich. You will notice how sweet the drinks are, so if you are the type of person that likes it on the bitter side, ask for less pumps of flavor. They have quite a few choices to choose from, each with it's own unique, creative, funny name, some related to monkeys, yodas, and john himself. They also offer a few pastries here and there, like the one I had, chocolate muffin, it was delicious.   They offer a punch card for the regulars, in which they double stamp if you check in on yelp. 10 stamps gives you a free coffee. I urge you to give this place a shot and support your local small businesses!",

I am not going to say that all of them have bad customer service by Starbucks maryland location is aweful! So back to my dear dear Grouchy John's, So from day one I have been a very happy customer! The customer service is the best I have ever experienced! That alone tells you why they have people come time and time again breaking away from the chain coffee places. The coffee is amamzing, love all of the creative flavored drinks one of my fav's is the Cinnamon dolce with white moca almond milk and whipped cream. Now on that note one thing I like is yes i am not getting reg milk but want whipped cream and they always catch it before I get my drink if someone forgets, the guy joked the other day and was like they can't miss the most important thing. The place brightens my moring with the friendly employees and the top notch coffe I am a fan of this place. I have not ordered a coffee that I have not liked almond roca mocha is another favorite of mine, I love the milk options as well, I prefer almond milk and they have sugar free flavors!! On halloween they showed their spirit dressing up one of the guys was an incrediable, that kind of tells you the type of service you will get with this place INCREDIABLE!!",

    "text": "I love being part of the #GrouchyNation!   My love for these guys started back in probably 2013, when I caught their food truck at First Friday's every month. To be able to develop a relationship with a couple of guys at a coffee truck is super rare, but these guys take pride in getting to know there regulars.   From there, I would travel far and wide from the southwest side of town to Grouchy John's for a delicious drink and friendly service. I got my entire FAMILY hooked.   But what's not to like?! Incredible staff, DELICIOUS drinks like their Butter-Me-Up (made with cookie butter), and a comfy chair to enjoy it all. Plus, they are so supportive of artists, so you'll always be surrounded by cool stuff there.    Just, do yourself a favor and pick up some of their \"Caffeinated Happiness\" today.",

Bagel with avocado and tomatoes was delicious, as well as the chai tea latte and coffee. The staff is also very friendly and accommodating. Atmosphere is awesome with all the artwork on the walls, lovely decorations, books, comfy couches and all!  Will definetely be back again soon.",

Most drinks are way too sweet for my taste and I prefer the coffee to be highlighted in drinks generally, and not the added syrups, spices, powders, and whatever else, but that's just my personal preference. The only drinks I do like are their pumpkin spice lattes, blended matcha, and their nitro brew. However the costumer service and the atmosphere is great :)",

Hospitality: 5 Stars The employees were kind, and made eye contact while I placed my order. Someone was even kind enough to have prepaid my drink order, that was a great surprise.   Food: 5 stars Unique coffee flavor, I choose the medium roast and was very impressed.  Overall: 5 stars Ample parking, hometown feel. I would recommend trying this local shop!",

Grouchy John's is definitely a spot that I would probably be at all the time to study and have a great coffee if I were in still in college. I guess that really shouldn't stop me because I guess one could say I could write up reviews and still have a great coffee. Alas, I digress...  As I mentioned, it is a great spot to study or do some computer related activity because they have wifi, coffee, access to outlets, and snacks.  They have almond milk which is a bonus because I drink way too much soy milk from other coffee spots that don't offer it.   I get the iced almond milk latte with an extra shot of espresso. Delicious. Unfortunately I tend to kill it before I even make it to my desk at work - then this John gets grouchy also.",

Second, they had little things that I really enjoy like Truvia and almond milk. That really should be enough, but GJ's keeps giving. Their parking lot is easy to get into and out of. I love the coffee shop, the feel, the view of the city. I enjoy my mornings there and when they're open late, I'll stop in just for fun. I've brought colleagues, family, and have had business meetings there. I enjoy the artwork on the walls and finally, but definitely not least of all, I enjoy the chit-chat I have with JJ and the rest of the folks at Grouchy Johns. Now, have I mentioned that before stopping in here, I really didn't get or enjoy the whole coffee shop experience. That all changed with my visit to Grouchy John's. The place is great. Try it out.",

Love this cute coffee shop!  They have shelves and shelves filled with books you can read or borrow and bring back.  The coffee is unique (they have special mixes) and the owner is very down to earth and friendly.  He gave us some tips for breakfast and I must say, they turned out to be excellent suggestions.  =)  Grouchy John's also has tons of board games and free wifi with couches to lounge around.  We came back a second time over the weekend and used the yelp coupon.  The guy behind the counter gave us 2 stamp cards fully stamped for our next visit to Vegas/Henderson!  I love that it's not crowded and you can stop by in the middle of your day to hang out and read a book or play a board game and talk to the workers.",

Being a student I often find myself going to one when I need to get out of the house (too many distractions) and get some hard core reading in.   I've been to the big chains and you can find me pouring over books in out of the way cafe's.  I've been to hipster joints, shi shi posh pinky finger up when you sip espresso places.  I've seen the highs and lows.  So what puts Grouchy John's heads and tails above the rest simple they care.  From the drinks to the way they treat customers they just care.  I've been here a few times now, and have just decided to up my frequency on today's visit.  Things I have noticed on my stay here firstly they seem to know their customers, now I'm not just talking drink preference any average Joe can do that, but they truly seem to know them and like them.  If I weren't the jaded individual I am I would assume that they're inviting some of their customers over for Sunday brunch, as they seem like old time buddies.  Now am on that level of chummieness with the staff, no, but that did not stop them from walking to my table and asking me if I wanted a glass of water. I know there is somebody out there saying, \"well whats the big deal with that\".  Well it is a big deal.... when was the last time somebody did that for you?  In fact I have seen them treat everybody with that same level of thoughtfulness and respect.  Now if this doesn't convince you to give them a try then let me just say this board games and star wars.... now if you don't like any of those things I think you're better off getting a coffee from the gas station because you sir are dead inside.",

Some of their drinks could have a little less sugar and a little attention to make sure that there isn't coffee on the drink but these are rare occurrances and just reminders to keep this place at its best. This coffee is well made and you can tell by the color of it. They keep the coffee local, the art, the pastries. This coffee shop will always be Vegas and always be a place that cares about its customers - without question.",

    "text": "Thank you, Grouchy John, for making this world a better place.  Hidden away in a quiet neighborhood on Maryland off of Windmill, I would have zoomed past this gem without giving it a second thought if it weren't for my buddies' raving reviews. I like the fact that Grouchy John's has a drive-thru for those that are in a hurry.   Small, quaint and homey is what I felt when walking in. There's a lot of books and board games so there's stuff to do if a cup o' joe won't cut it. Personally, I walked in with a mind set of getting some work done. And that, I did.   They have your typical coffee drinks. And then they have their specialty drinks. I ordered the ARM (Almond Roca Mocha) with soy milk. YUM! They don't do the whole latte art thing here, just some good java in a simple paper cup.   I was there for about an hour and a half and about halfway through my stay, a barista came around to check up on all of us and asked if we wanted a cup of water. Little things like that really make the difference between a regular coffee spot and an awesome one.   I always have some work to do and you can bet your dollar that I'll be back here to do so!",

The owner is fabulous...he makes sure you know he sees you and he thanks you for coming back. I used to love the bagels, they were moist and fresh and have showily gotten worse. Now everytime I buy one hoping for the latter they are dry and bland. Also, I love the maple bars and cheese danish and EVERY time I come in they are out.....literally always. Why not order more ? They are clearly in demand. Also I have voiced my concerns about the bagels and such and they look at me like....yea we don't really care. Soooo.....before......they would've tried to make it right or told the manager but now it's kind of just nonchalant......however these aren't issues if you aren't a frequent flyer here :) the coffee is always amazing! Hopefully they will get it back together and spread the love because this place used to be where I would go on a bad day.....and still go for homework :)",

I did not meet THE Grouchy John on my first of many visit to come but I say to you, well done sir!  First, The coffee is outstanding!  Second, there is a multitude of conversation pieces situated all through out the establishment. From books, wrestling masks, art, your java partner, to Star Wars paraphernalia there is much to talk about.  Third, free wi-fi, so you can hunker down if solo with any wireless device. Fourth, the TV playing any number of things Netflix has to offer.  This is sort of drive for me and I don't care!  The comfy chairs, couches and old/new school ambiance make this a place worth visting!!",

    "text": "So I try  to boycott Starbucks as much as I can. I am giving this place 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. The made me a salted caramel cappuccino fat free and sugar free! And it was delicious. Can I get a What? What? (At Starbucks it's hit or miss when I order fat fee and sugar free. I've paid 5 dollars for a not so great or even drinkable coffee.)  2. They were super friendly and help full. When my drink was ready they even asked me if I loved it, and if not they will remake it. Super nice and thoughtful!!  3.I liked it in there. It was inviting and clean. They had board games as well. My 6 year old's school is right around the corner so it is helpful if we had time to kill in the neighborhood.  I was considering giving it 4 stars instead of 5 just because they were out of 2 things I wanted to order. But after thinking a while I remembered that in comparison to coffee places I have been to, this place was so much better. My coffee was on point. Delicious. I didn't even need to stop at their \"condiment station\" and \"fix\" my coffee. I also understand that It is a new place and it is actually pretty busy, so understandable that they run out of things that are popular. Especially if these items are fresh. So I can appreciate their care of my satisfaction and the friendly staff. I'll be back and I will update if needed.   By the way they can make almost anything sugar free and fat free and that's an extra bonus!!",

It's a solid, quality offering...drip coffee...nothing fussy, and not expensive.  I quite enjoyed the Brasilian blend.  It's the type of coffee that there's no need to put sugar in (I definitely sugar my Starbucks).  My friend Marc, however, choose to order one of the fru-fru latte drinks which included some sort of \"monkey\" thing with bananas.  They were tasty, although that's not really my coffee preference.  They had a nice assortment of sweets and pastries.  I had a bagel they'd bought from some local bagelry (I'm going to make that a noun).    What really is cool though is that the staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The other neat thing is that they have a ton of games for play by customers just sitting around.  Seems like it would be a neat place to hang out.  Bonuses include Wi-Fi, a drive through, lots of power strips, and a free drink loyalty card.  We came here 3 days in a row for my morning coffee during my trip to Vegas.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here all the time.",

Instead I saw people talking with one another!  What a difference from other coffee places :)  They have once a month evening painting classes taught by Tommy Vinci.  I've been to 2 of these and they were fun.  They are the kind where everyone paints the same thing but everyone seems to paint to their own inner Van Gogh which is part of the fun of the class. You get a drink and a baked good with your class fee -- I like the Serenity Tea which had a very smooth flavor.   Over all this is a real plus to our community and I encourage you to drop by and give it a try.",

As I was driving, I see the store coupled with \"Drive Thru\" and thought that I might as well give it a go. The interesting thing here is that on Mondays, they pick out a random specialty drink off their menu and make it half off. On this particular monday, they chose the \"Grouchy John Latte\" which comes with white chocolate and amaretto. Initially I was hesitant because I had never tried or heard of amaretto at that point but I decided why not. And well, what could I say, it was love at first sip! I pretty much drank the entire thing (I couldn't sleep that night, but it was worth it!). And ever since that day I've been going and trying out their stuff. The drive thru can get a little busy so I recommend you also check out their interior, which is nicely decorated and full of Star Wars themed stuff! Another thing they do: they give out stamp cards so if you purchase 10 drinks, you get number 11 for free.",

So glad they offer services at UNLV too!",

We used the drive thru which by the way the sign says \"drive thru open 24/7\" which I am so happy to see.  We ordered iced coffee and  hot caramel vanilla machiatto. Both delicious and made right. The employees are super friendly. They saw our dog in the back seat and offered him a treat...nice touch!",

I ended up moving and not coming as often as I would have liked to. A few months had gone by and my friend and I decided we were way past due for a specialty drink, an Evil Monkey and a Butter Me Up. This location is 24 hours and before, anytime I have came the service and quality of the beverages were amazing. We came at midnight, didn't get the employees name but he was a stalky, curly headed guy with facial hair working the drive thru for graveyard shift. We ordered the drinks mentioned earlier and to our surprise they were absolutely horrible! My friends Evil Monkey was extremely watered down, she stated it tasted like water and coffee. My Butter Me Up tasted spoiled!! Had a funky taste as if it was made with spoiled ingredients. We were HIGHLY disappointed!! We tried to get the employees attention before leaving the drive thru to at least order a different drink. He looked at us, then turned back around twice smirking as if we didn't notice that he saw we were trying to get his attention!! I'm not sure what has happened to Grouchy Johns customer service and product quality lately at this location but we will probably not be coming back after this unfortunate experience!",

The wifi is super fast and dependable- plenty of charging outlets. The shelves are filled with interesting books you can read and the artwork is eclectic.  The staff is AMAZING!!!!!! My husband gave them a flavor profile he wanted and they offered up a customized version of their Sith drink- he said it was the best drink he's ever had and he's a former barista. Awesome drinks, the best staff, and yummy food to boot! Lemon muffins= love!!!!!  (They also do super cool painting nights!!!) Just noticed this- the yelp info is wrong about the hours- only the lobby hours are posted, but the drive thru is open 24/7!!!!",

Really friendly staff plus pastries and other snacks would make this place dangerous for insulin levels if I lived close.  No doubt they can easily satisfy a sweet tooth     The cappuccino foam wasn't artisan smooth but the shot was solid with a taste that blended with the milk pretty well.    Space for cranking on email for work or arguing with friends over the merits of George Lucas's edits to Star Wars.   The StarWars and other SciFi stuff kicks up the fun character of the place even more.  As a bundle this is a solid 4 stars if you come in and get the experience.",

Not to mention that the space was decorative and cool to admire (ex. selling art pieces or board games available to patrons). The coffee area was certainly busy fulfilling orders, and the girl I placed my order with wasn't phased by the activity and was nice.  Let's see... I ordered the Nutella coffee and Yoda smoothie. Both scrumptious! The coffee definitely tasted like the spread, and the Yoda smoothie I made last in my work fridge made me feel refreshed whenever I got to sip at it.  I hope I catch them on campus some time 'cause I've seen them around the Student Union, and I definitely remember seeing it parked in front of their home base.",

My fave is the hot Grouchy John which features white chocolate and amaretto, two of my favorite things on earth! One of my beloved drinks is an amaretto sour so the more amaretto, the better. Be warned, their drinks are rather sweet so request reduced sweetness if you can't roll with that. They also have these super cute stickers with their logo which they will give to you upon request. I got a handful and I'll be giving them out and spreading the Grouchy John love. The drive-thru is super speedy and their menu is quite varied. Their menu is Star Wars inspired with drinks named the Jedi, Sith, Yoda, and Lando. Being a total Star Wars nerd, this is a winning selling point for me.",

Which is what I look for when I travel because I prefer to support independent local businesses. We went through the drive thru and I fell in love with the names of the drinks and the clever approach right away. A clever marketing hook doesn't mean good coffee but it can explain the cost of the bill. Well, Grouchy Johns is different.  This coffee is pricy for the right reason.... It is amazing!   Just go if you haven't been because my words won't do it full justice. I am pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee and I will say- wow. Great beans, full flavor and better than just right. Please- just try this place once and see if you agree.",

I had forgotten how many times I've been back in the past 12 months, but I have to say, finding a decent cup of really good coffee on The Strip is zilt, nada, zero!! So I decided to walk The Strip and asked the locals where to go and get a good cup of Joe! Everyone said, go to Grouchy John!  It did not disappoint.  My first sip of their cappuccino, I was in heaven!! It was smooth and so good! I also enjoyed their funky wall decor. I also bought their delicious pastries, and I even got a chance to chit chat a bit with the locals.  There is also a nice outdoor area where they even provide a water bowl for your pooches.  With so much of my work travels to Las Vegas, Grouchy John, is the place for me to get away from all the hustle and bustle on The Strip!! I will definitely be hanging out here when I come back again for work!!  Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p",

I'm so excited about their second location near my downtown home.   Originally the shop was half of the size it is now, but they bought the space next door and expanded! It's the best place to study and close to UNLV if you're itching to leave campus.   They change their flavors with the seasons and I'm a fan of their Christmas/holiday flavors. The only complaint is that when I do opt for a hot drink, most of the time it comes out too hot and burns the integrity of the milk (yes there is such a thing). I can't complain because it seems like Sambalatte is the only coffee shop in town who has gotten the milk temperature right, but I digress. On hot summer days which is 80% of the year here in Vegas, I get an iced O.G 1/2 sweetened with almond milk! So delicious and it wakes me up instantly. Happy to be a part of the Grouchy John Nation!",

The staff really make this place wonderful. I ordered a Hot Caramel coffee and was blown away. I don't drink coffee often, but GJ's has converted me. The caramel was smooth and not too sweet. Everything in the coffees are just the right amount to enjoy the natural flavor with a hint of sweetness. My friends ordered oatmeal and both said it was pretty good. They have a stamp card system to get free coffee when you fill it up, as well.  There are two entrances to the building, and more room in the back where you can play table top games. They have an electronic piano with headphones and a pretty nice selection of games. Comfortable couches and chairs! I could seriously stay here for hours. Are you guys ready for the best part? FREE REFILLS on regular coffee drinks! That's right - you read that correctly. If you order a caramel coffee and want plain coffee after, they will refill your cup free of charge and with a great attitude. I don't think I've ever had such a pleasant experience buying coffee, and that alone makes me want to choose GJ's every time.",

    "text": "Wow! This place rocks my socks! What I first noticed when I walked through the doors was how colorful the interior is. Art from local artists decorates the walls and there is a display of Star Wars toys to your immediate right. The patrons were sitting in various spots throughout and looked very comfy at the different sized tables and chairs. The place is very large and great for big groups!   I ordered a blended mint mocha. Not very often to I go with the largest size, but I'm happy I did! I drank the whole thing it was so amazingly delicious. There are many milk alternatives available as well, I went with coconut milk this time. The menu is very large with lots of options! I can't wait to try them all. I really enjoy the stamp card they have as well, you get a stamp for every drink you buy and I believe after 10 you get a free drink. I wish there were more locations around the Vegas Valley.",

My favorite is the Chewbaca! Trader Joe's cookie butter + dark chocolate is my go to!   Part of the reason why I'm giving them 5/5, is because during finals week, I took a timed test online, and didn't realize that I would be going over their hours of operation. However, they didn't kick me out, or anything! They let me finish my exam, and were really nice about it too! I really appreciate companies/employees who empathize.   Some of my other fave things: the pastries (ask if they can heat it up, if you prefer it that way), and the breakfast sandwiches! SO GOOD! I love the croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage or bacon!",

There are two separate seating areas, with one seating area being accessed either from the main entrance storefront through a short hallway, or from an exit/glass door directly into the seating area.   Fun name descriptions for many of the food and beverage items they offer (ex. Shirley Temple of Doom, Sunny Day, Christmas in a Cup, the Yoda).  If you want to look at sci-fi memorabilia, play board games, or just sit and talk with your buddies while dining on coffee house fare, then this is your place!",

They're still keeping up with the great hospitality and they do ALOT of popular local events    I'm literally here every Saturday (much quieter than Starbucks on Eastern + more space)  They still kept up their old principles such as  -HALF off MONDAYS  -Free starburst with purchase -Caffeine art events -Employees asking each customer for water (LOVE THAT) -Stamp card!  New principles: -HALF off tea + coffee after I think 5pm on weekdays (don't quote me on the time, I think it's 5!) -More art work is hung up on the walls -OPEN until 9pm!! I think opening an hour later will support lots of college students & their late night studying habits   FAV DRINKS: -Shirley temple of doom -Butter beer latte -Honey latte -Dirty chai latte BTW they can adjust your sweetness. I read that a lot of people don't like how sweet it is, so I suggest to ask for LESS or HALF sweeten. They're more than happy to do it   Fun fact: I use to come here when I was in high school and now I'm about to graduate with my BS in 1 semester. I thank grouchy johns for providing me such an awesome place to just study & focus   #GrouchyJohnsFan",

It can be a little overwhelming if you've never been there before because there's so many combinations but if you like simple stuff like coffee and milk or an iced latte they can make that as well. The only issue I had was with our breakfast sandwiches. We got egg and meat breakfast sandwiches on croissant's but they came out burnt. We were only able to eat about half of our sandwiches because so much of it was burnt on the top and bottom. We basically just ate the egg and meat in the middle. I don't know if I will attempt another breakfast sandwich but if I'm in the area I would come by for coffee again. Another bonus is they have plenty of seating inside and a drive thru to boot.",

First off decor made me feel how inside of my head looks like lots of cool starwars stuff, eclectic art and their logo an angry cup of coffee (i love being angry). I came in the morning so the place wasn't crowded, they had a nice comfy couch (not worn out unlike other big chain coffee shops). I ordered their bulletproof coffee for wifey and myself. It was delicious. It wasn't too buttery and other ingredients complemented the coffee perfectly. Barista didn't just yell out my name unlike other places but delivered my to-go orders to me while I was sitting down on the comfy couch enjoying the place.  If there's a 10 stars I'll give to them. LOVE this place come here hang out great coffee with a homey feel and free WiFi.",

The Jedi (white chocolate, coconut) and Chewbacca (Trader Joe's cookie butter and dark chocolate sauce) ones have been my favorite so far. For less sweet options the bulletproof coffee (fresh-brewed coffee blended with MCT oil and grass-fed organic ghee) or the nitro cold brew are great options.  The place has stuff for non-coffee drinkers, too. My kid loves their strawberry smoothie and the suicide smoothie (strawberry, mango, peach) is my go-to order when I want something non-caffeinated.   If you need something to eat they've got a case full of bagels, muffins and pastries. Most are decent, if not spectacular.

You can't beat the service, it's a get to know your name type of place. It's hip, young, and friendly with some spunky coffee options and great pastries/avo toast.  I think one of the best parts of this place is the fact the bleed local. They support the community and local art, get involved with other small biz, and really leave a positive mark on the LV community.  Weather you're just traveling or live locally this is a must stop spot!",

The drinks were good, but really sugary and sweet. Very tasty though. Staff was really nice. They have a grab and go coffee table where you throw $2 in a basket and just pour yourself a cup of coffee, pretty cool. All in all good experience.  ****This was a pretty old review. For some reason the draft just went through...****",

The place is spacious and wide with numerous seating and the layout of the art pieces were very neat and colors just matched the calm relaxed surroundings. This actually feels like you can come here, sit down (outside patio seating available) and sip on some warm delicate coffee.   This place uses pure arabica beans all the way not no robusta like Starbucks, the quality of the coffee is rich, sweet, and earthy--just how it should be. If you want to come down and have a cup of joe, this place surely ain't your average! I'll definitely come back to try out the other lattes and espressos!  A+",

There is tons of seating and totally missed the back room. However, it needs a bit of an update or remodel.   Coffee is mediocre, I tried 3 different drinks: PBM, Grouchy John and Almond Roca Mocha. Probably rate it from best to worst in that order too, but the drinks were not too memorable. Except the Almond Roca because was too sweet/ syrupy tasting.   I left a bit disappointed after seeing tons of positive reviews for this coffee shop. I wished the baristas would have interacted with us more or gave drink recommendations.",

But, for now, all I can review on is their product.   I've been meaning to try out Grouchy John's because of the high ratings and praising reviews. Plus, it's really close to my house. So one morning, before work, I decided to swing by the drive through and get myself a cup of coffee. I opted for a soy latte, no flavor.   Bonus: if you check in on Yelp, they give you an extra stamp on your loyalty card, which is really nice. It definitely encourages people to come back. More you visit, more stamps you get, which gets you closer and closer to that free drink!   The employee that helped me was very nice and informative since it was my first time.   As for the latte, I couldn't even finish it. The coffee beans that they used produces acidic coffee. It was sour in my mouth. It made me wish I asked for regular milk because it might have covered the acidity better than the soy.   All in all, I don't think I'm a fan of their coffee. I'm not sure if I'd return.",

I was meeting up with my Ex to talk about some things and this seemed like the perfect place to do so. Casual, not romantic in anyway (although I guess you could make romance anywhere), and on my way home.   It's a funky place, and I like that. I love the decor and art work and the music was perfect, although I read and listened to my headphones until he arrived (late of course). I ordered a large dirty chai and it was quite tasty. I also got a bagel, which was good, except they don't give you enough cream cheese.    The staff is super friendly and although it was during their busy morning rush, they were rocking out those drinks! I love that there is a drive thru and I think I'll definitely be using this in the very near future.

Grouchy johns has mastered what every local coffeeshop aims to be in all areas of: consistently good and knowledgable customer service, a certain level of local collaboration (their business card area is always filled to the brim with interesting local businesses and startups, they have a full library of local literature like the Sunday, Vegas weekly and seven; the books in their library also appear to be comprised of a lot of donated good reads; thank you notes from local businesses and or from regulars can be found pinned up here and there, the art on the wall featured by local artists etc) that makes it feel like a genuine local spot that locals have indirectly or not helped to create, and they have a good handle on making a good cup of espresso that doesn't need to be masked by all the flavorings and whipped cream in order to hide their lack of skill and attention to detail like some other establishments (cough cough ahem starbucks cough lol). This place simply must be experienced in order to understand the \"hype\" and well deserved high praise. My recommedation/tip to spice things up?: ordering any of their specialty coffee lattes (rushmore, honey boo boo, the sith, etc) iced, breve with 1/4 of the usual sweetness. Of the holiday seasonal drinks, doing the above with their pumpkin spice latte was absolutely superb.  might seem a little finicky/nitpicky but it makes the world of a difference ;)",

They treat their customers right. The coffee is great. They have different types of milk to offer, such as almond milk. The selection is a wide variety of different coffee and tea. They have great frequent customer cards they will stamp each time that will lead to a free coffee. And best of all, they give starbursts at checkout. I highly recommend this coffee place.",

The coffee drinks are all amazing, I've never had one that I didn't like. During the \"fall\" I had them make me an iced pumpkin spice latter with cookie butter in it... Amazing (obviously) and It was WAY better than any over-sweet, syrupy Starbucks drink. Next time i'm in Las Vegas, this will be the first place I stop at!",

    "text": "I get bored working from my office from time to time and find working out of a coffee shop is not only a good change of pace, but you tend to get a nice treat away from your standard cup of Yuban made from the 8 year old coffee maker that's been collecting dust in the office kitchen.   I have passed Grouchy John's just about every Mon-Fri on my way from the office to the gym and never really gave it thought till today and my Yelp check for a nearby place ran me here because of the reviews.   And now i too have become a fan. I type this from one of the very comfortable couches that fills the interior and makes you feel very comfortable to chill out, work, or converse with friends over a good cup of Joe. The interior is a little funky but friendly with a wall full of books, unique art, and a Star Wars toys wut! The staff is uber friendly and welcoming when i entered. I mentioned my usual order at CBTL and asked if they could do something similar which is just a coffee with chocolate powder and they did it here with syrup (no charge) and it was perfect. I cant say that the coffee is anything any more spectacular than what i have had at other locations around town but i can say that i like the feel of the layout, the comfort of being able to sit and not be bothered to GTFO anytime soon, and of course the WiFi allows me to do my work my work.Service goes a long way with me, and friendliness never hurt anybody so i will certainly be spending my money here again when i want to venture out of my cave (office) and people watch while having a cup.   Note... they had a picture of a damn bowl of oatmeal i will have to check out next time in here for only a couple of bucks. If it wasn't taco Tuesday and id feel id ruin my appetite i would have done that for sure cause i sure looked tasty.   Also i had a young lady sit next to me the entire time i was here and just came in for the free WiFi, never bought a thing. Im sure your simply trying to be nice but i think a password or code for the WiFi would be a good idea so you dont have people doing this constantly. I always make sure i have something while im in a business like this because they are providing me a service so the least i can do is spend my money for what their offering...its only fair.",

I'm Longing for their special the MPC (Mango, Pineapple, Cherry) to make a re-appearance but the Strawberry Banana is keeping me happy for now. Which is weird cause I don't really like bananas. The last sojourn to where they were camped out on Goldring I brought some of my office with me. I ordered two different iced coffees. The special that day was a Matcha Green Tea and Kiwi smoothie. I sooo wanted to try it but I was not feeling the vibe for green tea that day. My clerk told me it was very light and refreshing. Oh, well maybe next time. They hand out candy with every drink order, as if I really needed any more sugar ...",

    "text": "John and John are kind of opposites when you meet them, one kind of quiet and surly, and the other complimentary and social-able, but put 'em together and you get one phenomenal coffee-shop.   From the local artists featured on the walls, to the huge selection of board games, and the clean and comfortable environment this place has was it takes.  It is my new favorite place to grab a cup when I am in the southeast area, and is one of the few places left to go that doesn't have a frigging mermaid on the cup.  The drinks are delicious, the coffee is wonderful, and the atmosphere is perfect for me.  If you like your coffee and you like to support local business and you are tired of the same bitter crap from bux, stop in and say hi and have a cup!.  Tell 'em I sent ya!   They won't care, but then again, neither will I!  As a lover of \"real\" coffee houses, I just can't say enough good about Grouchy Johns!",

    "text": "My \"food karma\" was working in full force that sunday morning I visited Grouchy Johns. My friend and I had a late night and were looking for nice coffee spot to help us wake up and get the day started. We walked into Grouchy Johns a bit fuzzy but we instantly perked up when we saw all of the cool star wars decor and local art work all over. It was a lot to take in, there was a lot of \"oooh's and aahh's\" before we even made it up to the counter. Then we were hit with the very wide variety of coffee and smoothie options, I am absolutely the most indecisive person on the planet, if your ever behind me in a drive thru I apolagize. I finally decided on the shirley temple of doom smoothie, this decision may have been made soley on the cool name. My friend got some iced latte and we shared a breakfast croissant sandwich.   Now here is where my \"food karma\" kicked in! The customer ahead of us paid for our whole order! And only asked that we paid it forward! Which we happily did for the couple behind us.   My smoothie was yummy and refreshing, and my friends latte was delicous as well, the breakfast sandwich wasn't bad, but could have been better. But all in all our experience at GJ's was pretty rad.",

I got Christmas in a cup it was a gingerbread white mocha latte.  It changed my life.  I literally raved about it to everyone it was PERFECT! The perfect sweet treat on a cold night. Not too sweet and just enough \"coffee\" flavor.  Doesn't it just sound delicious?   I tried to order the drink at Starbucks and it just wasn't the same. Since this is one of their signature drinks I just figure they spent time on finding the perfect gingerbread vs white mocha flavors.  Also my friend got one of their monkey drinks. Banana with Nutella maybe? I don't remember but it was delicious also.   It was made pretty fast, the girl taking the drink orders was nice enough, and the price was okay.",

My favorite drink is definitely their signature 'Grouchy John', made with White Chocolate and Amaretto.  One of my favorite Frappes in Vegas, when made right!  Unfortunately with all my visits I've been noticing that this frappe doesn't always have the same consistency . There were times when my drink would be undrinkable halfway through because its just too icey and I'm left trying to stir the ice with the super cheap straws that bend and break easily. As of right now you might want to stay away from Frappes and just go with iced coffee if you're fixing for something cold and delicious or you could try your luck and hopefully your frappe will come out OK.",

    "text": "I've had Grouchys long long ago when it was just a little trailer, but haven't had it since. I am not much of a coffee person, not because I don't like it, but many of them make me feel sick. It's a crapshoot, I don't know why it happens. I just gotta go for milder brews and hope nothing happens.  Thankfully Grouchys brews doesn't give me the ill effects and the flavor of the coffee is quality . According to a friend their beans are from a local purveyor, but I gotta confirm who exactly.   You can go inside and hang, but there is also a drive thru. Dont forget to check in for your extra stamps on your stamp card. If you're bringing coffee somewhere, ask for a stopper that seals in the drinking hole of the lid.   I got a A.R.M. (Almond Roca Mocha) Latte hot with almond milk and it was rather good. It kinda reminds me of a biscotti in terms of flavor. The BF got the salted caramel with half sweet. It was good this way, you taste more of the coffee flavor with a tinge of flavoring than it being masked with sweet and flavoring. Mine was full sweet and was good that way too, it wasn't overtly saccharine. I suppose just depends on the mood if I'll order more or less sweetener.   If coffee isn't your thing, they serve smoothies and tea based drinks and pastries too that are probably just as quality. I will try a non coffee drink one of these days, but it's just hard not to order coffee since I rarely get to drink it.   Its definitely one of the best coffee shops in town and wish there was one in our area. This is one of those businesses that could be a local chain. Until then, I guess anytime were even in the vicinity, we have to make sure we add in a detour for a drink here.",

    "text": "Grouchy John's is my NEW favorite study spot. It has everything I could want in a coffee shop and I would give this place more stars if I could... Sometimes, as I am driving to Grouchy John's, I found myself seriously considering whether or not I should just move closer to it since I'm there all the time. I would probably be there everyday if I lived closer.   So start off -- atmosphere is always amazing. I love that there are two separate rooms-ish. I think they expanded, I'm not sure. But one is more coffee shop like. The other is more like a fun lounge, cafeteria like atmosphere. Tons of games set up for your enjoyment. I love the decor!!! Super cute.. I love how community driven this coffee shop is!  I used to be a Starbuck's barista -- I'm not going to pretend and say I know a darn thing about coffee because really, they don't train you to know much -- but I will say that out of all my little experiments at Starbucks making secret drinks and concoctions... PALES in comparison to the amount of choices that you have here! Though I usually order my regular - iced coffee with light cream, I like to venture out and try interesting flavors now and then, and Grouchy John does just that! I've had quite a handful but still have mountain loads left to try -- and I love that. The OJ is probably my favorite so far!   I think what separates Grouchy John's from other shops -- the people. Definitely the people. I don't interact with them as much as I'd like mainly because I'm always in intense study mode. Medical school does that to you; takes away your ability to interact normally sometimes. ha, but I observe. The owner tends to be there, and he and his team ALWAYS makes the effort to let you know that you are well-taken care of. They are always welcoming, and put in that extra mile to acknowledge you. He often says \"Welcome back!\" That is so little, but can mean so much. It means -- he remembers you and hasn't forgotten you. I can't rave enough about the customer service they give and the genuine-ness that they provide. I set there HOURS on and and they don't ignore me, they will often come around and ask if they can bring water or refill my coffee. I love that it seems to be a very close-knit community and the owner seems to know everyone that walks in by name! They really try to make you feel at home here.   Other bonuses here: 1.) First coffee and tea refills are FREE! 2.) They have stamp cards, check in and get 2 stamps, get 10 stamps, and your next coffee is on them! 3.) On Mondays -- they have flavor of the day lattes half off!  4.) They have this Coffee and Paint? Not sure, something like that. But basically coffee instead of wine, and painting!! This definitely seems like fun and the art looks amazing! Again, love how engaging it is with the local and community around it!  I love trying new places because I am a huge foodie, but Grouchy John's has utterly put a stop to my search of finding a coffee spot. I don't need to try anywhere else! I rave about this place and tell all my friends because GJC deserves to be talked about. As a medical student, I don't know how else I would be getting through it all without GJC's... it really is the perfect atmosphere for me. The ONLY thing I would change about this place? Wished it stayed opened passed 8pm!",

Im a tea fan and was pleasently surprised to get loose leaf tea for the right price (even better, actually) Not only was my first time experience guided by a friendly barista but i continued to recieve the same genuine friendliness everytime I stopped by. i'll be dropping by grouchy johns for sake of good business everytime im in the area. bravo",

Cushy couches, open spaces, available books to read and games to play makes this place awesome. Although grouchy John is the owner (and from what I hear, he is really grouchy), there was nothing but great service and patience from my cashier as I asked questions about their unique drinks. This is a great spot if you want to enjoy a cup of coffee, read a book, or just hang out with friends over great java. Enjoy!",

I got the popular Grouchy John Frape on ice with almond milk (for the health conscious:) ) I'm impressed and lucky for me I checked in and got the double stamped for every drink I bought. The gentleman that served me was very professional and I appreciate the great service as a first time customer. Thanks Grouchy John for a great coffee drink to get my day started right.  My little guy is loving the strawberry smoothie so that makes me double happy for the drinks:) It's Friday, so go get yourself a fabulous yummy coffee drink:)",

All that being said, this place is better than the Starbucks down the street. If I was in the area, I'd go here again and maybe ask for some stronger roast (& skip the pastry).",

Also, the shop is a really comfortable place to camp out for awhile. The FASTEST free Internet anywhere, good tunes, and cool local art displayed on walls. Board games, books, free Starburst for kids, dog water bowls outside.... This place does not miss a beat!  I'm so happy I found this little oasis of quality and culture in this often soulless desert town.",

    "text": "4 Stars - Solid coffee, mostly consistent, and when inconsistent, they will remake it for you no questions asked.  If you like flavored coffees, this is definitely the place for you.  For me, however, I generally ask for 1/2 the normal flavor additives, because I find it overpowering otherwise.  If you want pure latte or regular coffee, they are quite solid. 5 Stars - The staff.  Yes, they're a mixed bag.  But in the end, they are always friendly, always helpful, and always willing to do whatever it takes to make you satisfied with your drink.  I was amused and pleased to note that after just a couple times there, many of the staff already know my name. 4.5 Stars - the Atmosphere.  It's great for when you're feeling silly, want to have a convo with a friend, or just indulge your sweet tooth.  The back seating area could be greatly improved on (thus the minus .5 star), because it has a cafeteria feeling and isn't as kitchy or funky as the main area.  Recommendations -  Honey Boo Boo, seriously, it's as good as it sounds bad.  Or maybe it's just that secret guilty pleasure. Sith - because why have mocha when you can taste the dark side? Chupacabra - because we sometimes need a bit of spice in our lives. Iced Latte - because let's face it, sometimes a good cup of iced coffee is all you want, and they do it good here.  Avoid - Bulletproof coffee.  Whoever invented this should have their tongue examined.  It's NOT good...  As in, imagine coffee were turned into a health food/coffee syrup.  It's what I imagine castor oil would taste like.  So uh.. I guess if you're finding yourself cursing due to traffic, it might be an effective deterrent?",

All the employees are so nice and always asking if I want water while I am studying there. They have lots of selections to choose from for even non-coffee lovers. Their pink donuts are to die for. Maybe it's my childhood memory of Homer Simpsons eating a pink donut that they are just so irresistible. They currently have heart shaped pink donuts in the season of Valentine's Day which is cute. My go to drink is blended Rushmore, and the strawberry smoothie taste delicious. Definitely a place to check out when you're in the area.",

The drive through always runs fairly fast even when your sitting in a line at 7 am in the morning not like the other main stream coffee shops where you wonder how many hours will you have to wait for a cup of coffee. The coffee shop is so cute and inviting as well, the couches and chairs are so comfortable which is extremely inviting to pull out a game from their wonderful selection, read book, or study for school.",
