Second star for the tasty cocktails that hit the spot for all of us.   Dirty laundry list:  Horrible service. Not only did our waitress seem to never be around when we did see her she avoided eye contact with our table like we were Medusa or something...strange. On two of her visits to our table she made rude remarks to us! The group of people I was with was not rowdy or obnoxious so I was really surprised to have such a hormonal waitress treat us so poorly.   The food. Let's start with the basics. Chips and salsa. Chips, no complaints. Salsa, wait, there was salsa on my table? I thought that was red water with tomato chunks floating in it? Wow. It was awful, kids. They serve chips with two salsas and beans and neither salsa worked. It needed more salt, cilantro and onion. It was like baby food level of heat. Bullshit. Next I had cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and it was just alright. Boring at best.   Ricardo's is a beautiful, clean restaurant but their delivery is all off. They've gotten lazy over the years and really need to work on their recipes and service so I'm not the last local native to be disappointed. No bueno Ricardo's.",

The cheese enchiladas were sooooo gooooood!!!  Also, on the buffet was beef and chicken breast fajitas (not thigh meat), build your own tacos and taco salad, and flour and corn tortillas.  Chips with three different kinds of dipping sauces were delivered to our table.  Our waiter was extremely friendly, encouraging us to \"stat as long as you like...it's hot out there.\"  Two thumbs way up!!",

Throw in some fresh pico and guac and you've got a deal that puts that Speedy Gonzalez plate to shame!  We were staying on the strip and in need of a quick lunch. I remembered Jessie B's buffet find of the week, and I had my husband sold at buff...   The restaurant is big and clean. We were seated promptly, and from there, it was all corn tortillas and smiles. First, I was actually impressed that they still bring out a basket of chips, two salsas and bean dip when you are going for the buffet. I half expected them to withhold these treats from the gluttonous buffet eaters!   The buffet offers cheese enchiladas ready to snap up, or they will roll you up beef or chicken with either a red or green sauce on top. For the tacos, they have small, corn tortillas that they double up and fill with carne asada, chicken or ground beef, plus cilantro and onions. You can also get a crispy taco shell. Then there is a little fixins bar with pico, guac, lettuce, cheese, jalapenos, and so on. My only complaint is that perhaps the food could have been a tad warmer, but everything tasted great, especially for a $9.99 buffet! I was actually very impressed with the guacamole. You can tell from the partially smashed avocados that it is made fresh. I actually went back just for a plate of it and some pico. I am a lady who loves her vegetables.   Equally impressive was the service. You generally don't expect much service at a buffet, but our water glasses were never less than half empty! That alone is better than most of the magic tricks in Vegas, and they have a table side credit card machine, which is an unexpected, but appreciated convenience.   This was our first trip, but I am sure it won't be our last! Quick, good value and tasty is a winning trifecta we are unable to resist!",

I had two carne asada tacos, cheese enchilada and chips & salsa. The enchilada was bland the only hint of flavor was the acidity from the tomatoes. The salsa, too, was bland and watery. The chips were pretty generic. The first taco was ok, a bit bland, but tender. The second was filled with grizzly meat. It really turned my stomach. Fortunately, the service was friendly and they were able to accomodate our large group.",

It brings so much art and food together. The decoration is so pleasant and the service impecable.

The food is just average and is quite bland in some cases. It does not seem to be based on any particular home style or authentic recipe. I was disappointed especially since they charge a bit more than some. I tried a few more times just trying to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Such as a bad cook or problems with management.

It was a weird sauce with chunks of something unidentifiable.

She never came back (She got busy with 2 other tables and attended to their order). In the meantime, the bus girl came over an refilled or drinks but couldn't do anything about the food.  When our waitress finally remembered us was when she was walking by our booth to get refills for the other tables, and I asked her for the check (at this point I was done with this whole experience). We paid the $26.00 for our food and left.   We will never be back again. It USED to be a great place to eat. The service was ok.

    "text": "11/21/17  Not first time at Ricardo's, but pretty sure it'll be the last. At least for a long time. Nobody's food was HOT, you know like sizzling, watch you don't burn yourself HOT. The claim was short handed in the kitchen but while we were finishing our meal, a waiter brought out plates of sizzling hot food for another table. We commented on it, so the waitress offered to make it right by removing some items from our bill. Problem was that made things more confusing because none of the food descriptions matched so we weren't sure what was exactly credited. The minimal effort made by the staff just cemented our view that we had eaten our last meal at this establishment.  I prefer leaving positive reviews but this visit warranted letting others know that good can turn bad in the blink of an eye.",

    "text": "Meh....  Yesterday, my fella and I had planned to go to a reopening of a popular restaurant, but they've pushed their opening back, so we had to find something else for dinner.  We finally decided on Ricardo's, which I'd never had.    Walking in, the inside is a little run down, and shabby.  Its a little on the dark side, and each booth in the bar area we were seated in had a TV IN the booth.  I don't like this...If I wanted to watch TV, I'd sit at the bar.    We got there in time for happy hour, and so I had a \"small\" regular margarita for $4.50.   This wasn't small!  I'm glad I only got the small, because it was so big I couldn't finish it.  This was my favorite part of the evening.  It was a good, strong margarita, and I'd go back for happy hour just to have a couple of these, for sure.    For dinner, I ordered the nachos, no meat (also on the happy hour menu: $7).   Morgan had the combo carnitas taco and shredded beef enchilada, served with rice and beans.   Meh.   The portions were enormous.  I ate a ton of food, and it looked like I didn't touch my nachos.  The waitress actually came over and said \"You didn't like them?\"  No...there's just WAY too much food on the plate!  They tasted ok, but I've had better at Qdoba.   Morgan wasn't impressed with his, either.  The enchilada was good, but we make better at home.  The carnitas taco was bland.    Service was awkward too...our waitress was nice, but had 0 personality.  She disappeared at random times, and the checked on us twice within about 3 minutes...space it out! Its ok to let us eat for a minute.  Really.  Food was pricey for the quality.   I don't know that I'd come back for anything other than a margarita during happy hour.",

When I say salsa. . .I mean they bring you a trio. . .a normal red salsa, bean dip and a green salsa that is NOT salsa verde.  The green salsa almost tasted like it had a little bit of avocado in it???  It was creamy but still thin with chunks of onions and cilantro running through it.  Would I go back for just the salsa trio that comes out with chips?  That would have to be a yes. . .I am not a fan of the bean dip. . .but OMG the green one was da bomb!!!  =)  And did I mention that the salsa trio and chips are FREE!  LOL  =D  Onto the entrees. . .  I had the nachos with beef. . .it was really really good. . .It came with sour cream, gucamole. . .well pretty much the fixings. . .and no pics cuz someone. . .mainly me. . .was starving!  The meat was tender and no it was not ground beef it was shredded meat.  The only bad thing were the beans and that was my bad since I forgot to ask for it with no beans.    The bf had the enchilada and taco combination.  He said that it was really really good.  He barely talked to me. . .he was so busy eating. . .now you know that means that it has to be good!  LOL  ;)  Service was where I took off the 1 star.  We had to wait to get them to bring us our ticket. . .and then when we wanted to use credit card we had to go into the bar to pay as the bartender was the only one that knew how to use a credit card swiper. . .weird I know!  So yes I will definitely be back!!!  And the cool thing?  They are open 24/7. . .now I know where to go and eat when nothing is open late night!  LOL  =)",

    "text": "I have never written a bad review on yelp before but I am severely annoyed with my experience at Ricardo's tonight. I sat at the bar for a few minutes the bartender manny or Manuel arrived and I ordered a margarita. I asked for it to be put into a pint glass instead of their maragarita glass(as I always do) because I don't like their margarita glasses. The bartender said it would have to be charged as a large margarita?! But said he would only charge me for a small. I wasn't asking for more alcohol just a different glass. On my check I was charged for a medium margarita. I also put $20 into the gaming machine and was not comped for my one and only drink. The bartender never told me his name. I had to read it on his name tag. Btw I was the only patron in the bar. He asked me how my food was and that was it and he just sat behind the bar between tasks on his phone. I don't need to have a bartender up my ass or anything but some friendly interaction is what you'd expect. I'm mostly pissed that I've been charged more for using a different glass and wasn't comped for the only drink I got when I gambled $20. Been here many times since I was a kid and adult and this guy sucked. Maybe he was having a bad night but this makes me never want to go back and I live around the corner",

    "text": "This was the consensus of the group of 4 of us that visited Ricardo's for lunch.  We did not partake in the lunch buffet for $11.99, but instead ordered off the menu.  Guess that was a mistake!  Two of us ordered carnitas tacos - it was dry, hard strips of meat (not shredded or cubed), more like leftover from the fajitas, with a teaspoon of diced onion, but NO cheese, no salsa, no tomato, no lettuce, that's it.  Tasteless, hard meat.  Two of them.  The beans were fine, but it's hard to screw those up, as was the rice.   One person had enchiladas, very average enchiladas with very little filling and a whole lot of sauce on top!  Nothing to make your belly smile, that's for sure.   Another person had the tortilla soup -- and there was NO CHICKEN, but loads of celery!!  Must've been cheap that day . . . it was more of a veggie loaded soup with chicken broth.    Another person had the meatball soup (not sure what the proper Mexica name is), but there were TWO tiny meat balls.  That's it.  And a whole lot of dark broth.     I LOVE chips n salsa -- they also had a bean dip and green salsa, all were pretty good, not the best ever, but enough to have me optimistic about my meal.  The chips were the kind I like, crispy, corny with just enough salt.  It is because of the chips n salsa that this is a 2-star (and not a 1-star) visit.    The place was pretty busy for lunch, but most dined at the buffet.  Perhaps that's your best bet.  They do make some nice sized margaritas, but we didn't have any this trip.    It wasn't good, it's highly unlikely I'll revisit, but I'm glad I tried it as I drive by it enough and have always wondered.  Now I know ! :)",

The chicken seemed stewed with a really weird aftertaste. The enchilada sauce was just not great (and I love all enchiladas). The chili relleno had a fridge or freezer taste to the outside breaded part. The rice was a tad soft as tho too much water had been put into it. My husband liked the thick chips but they didn't taste completely homemade and they were salty to the core. I hope the owners read this review so they can be aware.",

The halibut saute was perfectly seasoned and didn't require any additions other that the lemon included on the plate. The house entrees include refried beans-with cheese-, rice and their a version of street corn(in this case, it was sort of like creamed corn). The portion of flan is rather small but the brownie(more of a cake-like texture) with ice cream is a substantial portion(and it doesn't include nuts).",

    "text": "I have to say that I don't like to give bad reviews unless it totally warrants it. This is one of those cases. I went there with my four daughters. None of us enjoyed our food. My Twins both ordered Carne Asad a burritos. They each had about two bites saying that it didn't taste anything like Carne Asad a. One of my girls actually took the side of beans next to the burrito and put it in a tortilla and ate that instead if her $13 burrito. My oldest daughter got a ck chimichanga.  I mean how hard is it to mess that up. She ate about 4 bites of it. My other daughter got the enchilada suiza which is the same thing I got. It had ck machaca in it and sour cream. The ck was cold and had a horrible flavor. I NEVER complain to an establishment I normally just leave and never go back. I had to in this case say something. They sent the manager over. Her name was Soraya.  She was not accommodating at all. I have to say I wasn't asking for a discount but when the entire table doesn't eat or take their food home maybe you should discount down the bill. Just my thought. After I spoke to the manager our server who was really cool at first became really short with us and him and the other servers gathered and I'm sure discussed that I had complained. Thanks for making it completely uncomfortable. I ended up paying $86 for the meal and I still tipped the server 25%. I will definitely never go back and tell all of my friends and family to stay far away from this establishment.  It is the most non authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten.",

I thought it was a restaurant-lunch-dinner type place- but no, not only do they serve food all night- but they have a bar and gaming open as well. And can I just say that the set up is pretty sweet, comfortable, chairs and booths plenty of room. This was my second time grabbin a bite at Ricardo's. The first time I fell in love with their mini rolled taquitos (chicken) which were meant to be an appetizer but the plate was so big it was the only plate I had- it was the only plate I NEEDED. YUMMY. The second time I had PORK ENCHILADAS- on the menu it states the flavor is AMAZING.. I dont know about amazing but it was very good! Once again the proportions were huge and I barely got through half the plate.   Chips, salsa, and bean dip were delicious as well! I was impressed :D This place is a little pricey($11-15$ per plate) but I believe well worth the price.",

We also don't know what was available for happy hour because you only get to see that menu/special in the bar area.  So we were VERY disappointed.  At the very least they should advertise it in the regular dining room so people will know for next time and will come back and goto the bar area.  Dinner was good, but not great.  We were going to order some margaritas and they sounded really yummy on the menu and even saw another table with some, but there were no prices on the menu which means EXPENSIVE!!  So we didn't order any drinks.  No real complaints.  We of course waited for our check and that took awhile (not uncommon for most places)    We came back about 2 weeks later for the fajita lunch buffet and we were the only ones enjoying the buffet and it was yummy but they weren't setup for it and some of the items were cold.  We were disappointed and won't be back for it.",

Be prepared to tip the dealer around $3 per session.  Also, there is a person who hands out seat assignments for each session and you needs to sign in with that person.   As for the bar area, I enjoyed a nice tequila sunrise on the house since I was playing video poker and won a little.  I ordered a chicken Mexican pizza appetizer and it was delicious. I would probably put the guacamole on the side next time. Serving was huge!  Happy hour special price of $8.   Service was okay since they were busy. The host at the front was very rude; bartender and bar back were polite.  Decent experience.",

The seafood enchiladas were good, but lacked seasoning. There was plenty of fish and less shrimp, but both needed some flavor. I dumped the salsa from our chips 'n salsa on the enchiladas to add that flavor. I also asked for some hot salsa and got a fruit based hot salsa which was very good. The rice was not the traditional Mexican rice I'm used to, it was white rice and was probably better.   I liked the ambiance of the bar/dining room where we ate. They have cool globe lights on the ceiling and the backdrop of the bar is very inviting. I had a prickly pear margarita which I think is hard to find around here and it was very good!",

    "text": "This place is good but not great.  There's lots better around.  To me it feels overpriced.  Their happy hour is more reasonable but the regular menu is high even compared to big cities like LA and SF.  I guess their niche is they're always open 24/7 but it's a bit creepy you have to ring the bell and be let in late night.  I recommend Ricardo's for happy hour but not for dinner unless you want to pay 50% more than the other spots in the area.",

Soggy and.....as I took a bite, there was definitely something that didn't belong. I took it out of my mouth and it was a chewed up sunflower seed! The thought of that seed being in a strangers mouth made me start gagging. Although I was not charged for it, it still makes me nauseous thinking about it. Then to make things worse, I was told the day before the exterminator was there for...... Wait for it...... FREAKING RATS!!!! So if you haven't guessed by now, I will not ever eat there again.",

And angrily takes our order for drinks. We also order our food since we had sat there for so long.   Our food came out completely uncooked. The steak had frost on it. Nobody came by to ask how the food was so we walked the steak back to the kitchen. The guy yelled at my friend for coming back to the kitchen.   The waiter stepped on both me and my friends feet. And did not apologize and not to mention he was sweating into the food he was serving us.  When we complained he ignored the complaint and just rang us up.   Overall the worst service ever!!!

There was a large party- maybe Graduation or a wedding, we weren't sure- but it was buffet style. There was entertainment in two forms- (1) a singer who looked like he was from the wild west or was it mariachi-like? It was black- had adornments all throughout- what do you think? (2) a balloon twister animal shaper maker- ok, I don't know what the exact term is, sorry- but anyway, he made some pretty neat shapes for the kids.   Salsa and chips were very good- we needed more. Refills on water took forever. Our food took a while too, come to think of it. I had the fish tacos, which was good, not great, but good. I don't know if the poor service was because of the large party, but it could've been better. The tables were all occupied, where we were seated. So, it was busy all around. The bill was pretty good for our group of five, so the prices were not bad.  I would be willing to try it again. Maybe it was an off night. The first time I ate here, was in college, and the restaurant was located either on Tropicana/Eastern corner or the Flamingo/Eastern corner. I did remember that the rice chicken dish that I had was really good.",

I don't know, that may be why I strayed away from eating at Mexican restaurants. I have to say that I recently became acquainted with Ricardos. I've gone there for lunch and dinner within two weeks. I'm a consistency type of person and ordered the camaron  enchilada each time. I consider the serving huge because both times I had leftovers. Not to say I got to consume my leftovers but I was happy to share. The Guacamole is fresh and a huge variety is offered. At the dinner service my dinner mates ordered a variety of items that included combination plates and something for the non red meat eater. My second trip for lunch we found out that they had a buffet. I believe they had crab legs on the line that night. I'm just saying welcome back to my life Ricardo's. Everyone in my party drove from the Sunrise Mountain Area. You were well worth the ride. Don't go trying to expand to every corner of Las Vegas. Stay Weird!!!!",

    "text": "Since I have a taste for menudo, the wife always searches out places that 1) have it and 2) are good at it. This is the place. I CANNOT stress how wonderful the menudo at Ricardo's is.  We went right around lunch and the peak of the rush was over, so we were seated right away. The place is decked out like many other Mexican places. Stucco and color are the deals of the day. Nothing overly done, but certainly not bare. Sacramento was our server and he was awesome. The timing on our food was spot on and he kept checking to make sure we were good to go.  As this was a menudo recon mission, I ordered the bowl of menudo and then went with a Colorado Burrito plate. Wife had the Chili Rellenos (and a taste of my menudo). The menudo was wonderful. The broth was rich and loaded with taste. Just enough hominy. The tripe was not that spongey smooth tripe you normally get, but honeycomb! It is served with lime, oregano, red pepper flakes and cilantro. Did I mention how wonderful it is? It is by far, bar none, absolutely the best menudo I have ever had (from FL to CA, MI to TX). It tastes almost like they have vats of it brewing away in the back all the time. So rich and delicious.   The Colorado Burrito was good, but after the bowl of menudo (did I mention how great it was?), I could do no more than taste it. The sauce was rich and worked well with the meat, but seemed a bit on the small side. The beans and rice were plain and portions were small. Overall the plate was \"OK\". Other than portion size, I really had no issues. The wife's Chili Rellenos were good. She told me they were done VERY well. The creams and toppings played right to the chili's and she thoroughly enjoyed it. In her case, she could eat half and take the rest home (to be honest, I took most of my burrito home - due to the menudofest).   Overall, we have now found our go-to place for menudo (sorry, Stations). I am less concerned with the rest of the menu items. They all look good and if they are like what we had, they will satisfy and please. BUT, this is THE place for menudo. Do yourself a favor and try it out.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d422711-r340063958-Ricardo_s_Mexican_Restaurant-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=df2e7f9a867148d292444a2b7513c11bb9769159d49adcf17f03c889f8abc0e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

    "text": "Time to update my review since it had almost been two years since I last visited.   Walked in on a Saturday night and it was very quiet and empty, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and we were seated promptly. There were only 4 other tables occupied. I had been craving a shrimp salad from Lindo's for the past few weeks so I was a bit upset at my husband for not wanting to take me, we were going to catch a movie at the Palms so we needed to eat at a restaurant in close proximity, boo! From what we remembered, the food and service here was good so we drove right over.  We were seated promptly but we waited a few minutes for our server to appear. My husband and I both ordered waters with lemon and a waiter brought out chips along with bean dip, red salsa, and an avocado salsa. The avocado salsa was the best, they only times I've ever seen it made are at catered parties so that was quite a treat, loved it!   For my entree I ordered a chicken caesar salad ($10.99), they don't have a shrimp salad which was a let down for me. I asked our server if I could substitute the chicken for shrimp, he said he'd ask the chef and that he'd be right back. I knew that if he agreed I would pay a few more dollars which was fine with me. When the server came back out he said that I would have to be charged $20 for the salad if I wanted it with shrimp, I was expecting to be charged a few more dollars but not almost double, so I stuck with the chicken. My husband ordered a steak chimichanga for his entree. We didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, maybe 15 minutes tops. My salad was topped with cotija cheese which gave it a different flavor, not bad, just different. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but seasoned well, it was your average salad, decent. My husband did not like his entree very much, he said the steak was too fatty which is something he detests. Overall, we were not very pleased with our meals. It was subpar.   Now on to the service. The server didn't even check on us once when he dropped off the food, he only came back to ask if we wanted dessert or the bill. I wanted a flan so I ordered, he came back out with the flan and bill. The flan was bland to me and it had a different texture than what I'm used to, it was not very sweet and if it had caramel, I couldn't taste it, the best part of it was the whipped cream and cherry on top. Overall we spent $28 on our meal which isn't bad but the food isn't that good anymore, I might be back, I might not, for now, I have much better options for mexican food elsewhere.",

My husband ordered a combination plate (cheese enchilada, rice and beans) the server we had obviously wasn't paying attention and asked my husband what kind of meat he wanted after my husband clearly said cheese enchilada. I ordered a combination plate with a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno. Our food arrived and my very first bite of the chile relleno had egg shells in it. We got the server and told him, and he said that it was supposed to. I told him no, I understand that the chile was dipped in egg, but somehow egg shells got into the mixture. He asked me where the egg shells were. I had spit it out into my napkin and was very irritated that he had the nerve to ask where the egg shells were, as if I was making it up to get free food. It took several minutes for us to get across to him that at no time should there EVER be egg shells in food and he had an attitude and said he would get the manager. The manager came by and did NOT seem very apologetic. She did take the plate back and got me something else. I understand that in a hurry that it is possible for it to happen, but the way that this issue was handled was unacceptable.  I don't think that I will be returning here for a very long time...if ever again.",

Well to start off we order the Guacamole. It's come out HORRIBLE and beyond salty. I'm not a picky eater but this was ridiculous so I asked for limes and Jalepenos and cilantro to help boost the overall taste. After trying to be kind and not be that customer thats always complaining, I simply asked for a side onions. He proceeds to toss the whole container of onions from the back kitchen instead of a side and walked away. Took 15 minutes to get a refill after food was finally coming out. Very very disappointed in this place and highly recommend to stay away whether you're hungry or not. Taco Bell's close so I'd go there if you don't want your appetite spoiled by lousy customer service in which you almost feel like you're a nuisance.",

The buffet provided small tortillas for street tacos as well as hard shell tacos. There was also beans, rice and enchiladas. The enchiladas we're not that great, the sauce was too sweet. Additionally, there was not sufficient enchiladas for our party of 8, as well as the small tortillas for tacos. There was no one tending to the buffet to restock items such as the enchiladas and tortillas for at least 20 minutes which made it a huge inconvenience. You'd think they would have staff on hand to make sure nothing was missing from the buffet to meet demand.  I do not recommend this place, you pay sit down prices for meals you can purchase at Pepe's tacos.",

Unless you're Hispanic or a regular you'll most likely have a horrible experience. I strongly suggest you NEVER dine here. NEVER.

The waitress was very friendly and fast to come greet us.   I started my meal with a melon margarita, naturally, and it was delicious. Very strong, just how I like it! The complimentary chips and salsa was great too. It came with a red and green salsa as well as beans. For an entree we split the steak fajitas. This I was somewhat disappointed in. The veggies were great but the steak seemed a bit bland. I would definitely try something different next time.  Overall they had great service and decently priced food. I also love that the location is pretty centrally located. I'm sure I'll be back for more.",

One, the cheese they used was good by itself, however, there was a huge clash of different flavors going on with my chicken enchilada plate. I can't tell you what I was eating. I can tell you it tasted like soup.   I also ordered a chorizo taco, which is Mexican sausage. If you're used to the crumbled chorizo, it's not. It's solid sausage. Took a bite and was scared to finish it...  My husband enjoyed his carne asada tacos.   Red salsa taste canned The green salsa is great Guac is awesome Refried beans are a no go! Side rice is traditional Coleslaw? Bland.  Chips nice warm and perfectly salted!  Server was great! Even got to pay right there at the table, which is beyond convenient! Bus boy refilled our pop and chips without asking! (Poor kid was running around working super hard!)  But if the people of Vegas like it, who's this Chicago girl to judge?",

    "text": "I classify Mexican food into two categories: \"Tex-Mex\" and \"Authentic Mexican\". I usually don't eat Authentic Mexican food unless I'm in Mexico, New Mexico, East Los Angeles, or Texas.  I've been to this place a few times in the past usually between 11AM and 3PM, but I woke up at 7AM this morning with a craving for Tex-Mex, so I went there at 8AM because they're open 24hr/day.  I really didn't know what to expect at that hour (maybe they only served Mexican omelets or huevos rancheros, etc.), but it turned out that they offered the regular full menu. I got the combination plate, which is usually what I get if I go to Cabo's or Garduno's, but I'd have to say that Ricardo's was better than the two aforementioned restaurants. I can't explain how it was better, but there was something in the seasoning that reminded me of the food in Mexico. The rice was very soft and the refried beans had no lumps of beans, both of which I liked very much and is not the case with other restaurants. There was only one man there, who acted as host and server, and he treated me like family. He even said, \"Would you like chips and salsa, or is it too early?\", which I thought was very efficient, and it would be the same thing that I would say at 8AM (of course I answered, \"Absolutely\"). I drink a lot of iced tea, and after I downed the first glass in 60 seconds, he put a carafe of it on my table, which is what I would do as well (I ended up drinking two carafes).  I wish that I brought my i-phone so I could've taken a picture of the combination plate, because the taco shell was not a regular taco shell, but more like a tortilla that was deep-fried. They also took the stem off of the chili relleno, which again, I thought was great, and I can't remember any other restaurant doing that. I told the waiter exactly what I just wrote, and he was very gracious and said that he would relay my sentiment to the chef. He also mentioned that they get all their ingredients from California, which made sense. I don't know what more I can say. It was very, very good. Now, I have to add a third category for Mexican food: \"Authentic Tex-Mex\".",

I had to bring my riend to try it out.Our server was efficient and served us right away.   Prices are moderate. For 2 people  with an alcohol beverage $45.00.

When the waiter approached us we told him and apologized, asked what to bring for drinks but we had no menu. So regardless we ordered drinks without knowing what kind of drinks they served. Brings us our drinks and leaves. 20 MINUTES LATER ASKED WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ORDER WHEN WE NEVER HAD MENUS TO BEGIN WITH. Apologizes brings our menus and we start to order, food was not bad but a little pricey. When the manager which is an older man approached us to leave our receipt, I told him we'd be splitting the bill in 3, walker so bothered and his whole demeanor was uncomfortable like it bothered him when we told him we wanted the bill split in 3. We asked for a discount for waiting 20 minutes without a menu, dirty silverware and bad service and the manager said no. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",

To make the story short the reason why I gave 1 star Is when I paid the bill I didn't put any tip yes I didn't because of how they treated us and how the service was... They bother asking the other table how their doing but didn't bother asking us if we want anything else or hot sauce for our nachos we have to ask for it for several times before it came...

    "text": "Was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant off the strip and came across this little gem. I'll break down this review based off of the items I had to eat & drink.  Chips: Were super crisp fresh and delicious.  I found these chips much better than the average fair you find at a Mexican restaurant.  Salsa: They give you three different dips to try.  The bean dip is out of this world delicious, like others have mentioned it is really good.  The green salsa was more of a light Avocado salsa and had a nice flavor and just enough heat. The tomato red salsa was bland and watery with no flavor at all.  Was really disappointed with the red salsa compared to how good the others were.    Cheese Enchilada: Probably one of the BEST I've had in quite awhile. The sauce had a rich deep flavor and the spices were balanced well. The tortilla was not soggy and filled with delicious gooey cheeses.   Chicken Taco: The chicken was very flavorful although the tortilla was a little on the stale side.  The toppings were good but very minimal.    Beans & Rice: One word OUTSTANDING! Really creamy beans that had a nice texture and the rice had some great flavor with the traditional peas in the rice.  Margarita: Had a Mango Margarita and it was average to good.  Nothing to special but nothing bad either.    Overall a great experience with a very friendly staff.  \"Freddie\" was a great waiter who was super attentive and funny.  Well be back!",

We were seated and given chips, 3 different types of salsa, and water right away. The chips were very warm and fresh, which was surprising considering it was 2am.  I opted for the Tostada Fiesta without sour cream (9.95) and my boyfriend got sirloin steak fajitas (14.95). It came within 10 minutes and boy did it look yummy! We both took a bite and it tasted just as good. The portions were very big, so we weren't able to finish, but we had some awesome leftovers.   I highly recommend this place for late night dining. It's very mellow since there aren't many people dining and the lights are dimmed a bit to give it a romantic/relaxing mood.   The second time we came here, it was for the $10 taco buffet. We found out about the it the first time we were here because the waitress suggested it.   The place was a little more poppin' this time since it was around lunchtime and I'm sure there's a lot of regulars that enjoy the buffet. We were seated and given chips and salsa right away. Pretty awesome considering we were paying for the buffet and we still got complimentary chips n salsa. I also ordered a cherry coke and the waitress brought it with a couple maraschino cherries in the cup, which was a tasty little treat.   We headed down the steps and to the buffet. It was rather small, but it had all the necessities to get your tummy to grow twice its size. There were tacos, chile relleno, enchiladas, rice, beans, fresh guacamole, salsas, carnitas, carne asada, shredded pollo, and even tostada bowls to make your own crazy concoctions,   We both put as much food on our plates as we could possibly fit. We just wanted to make sure we tried everything and we sure did. Needless to say, by the end of our meals we were extremely full and very satisfied. The quality of the food was great, especially for the low price that you pay.   I'd definitely come back again. You get the most bang for you buck with the buffet, but if you want a nice low key dining experience then come here for a late night dine.",

On top of that, when we told the manager about it, he ADVISED us not to put too much salsa on Enchilada with very annoying tone.  He actually implied that because of that the food becomes cold. Rather than apologizing, he sort of became upset. On top of all that, they included 18% gratuity to the bill which we thought was way over what they deserved.",

This place is like a El Torito/Whole Enchilada restaurant. There was a sunday buffet available, but we ordered fajitas.   The food is just 3 stars, and slightly overpriced to me for Vegas (13 bucks for fajitas) but what made this place special to me is the waiter named Freddie. SERIOUSLY this guy made us laugh constantly! Very personable, and he is the reason that I would come back here.   Waiters like him are rare.     I would do the buffet next time or eat here for dinner, but if you are in the area, stop by and ask for Freddie to serve you!!!!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Ricardo's as this was where my Mom decided to take me for my birthday dinner.  I had heard both good and bad reviews so I kept an open mind to decide for myself.  It kind of reminds me of the American style Mexican food of El Torito's from back in the day.  I decided to get the steak fajitas and my Mom decided on a combination plate that included an enchilada, taco and chile relleno. The taco was horrible, she took two bites and was done with it, the enchilada was sad however she liked the chile relleno.  I enjoyed the chips and dips they bring out to enjoy prior to your meal being served.  My iced tea was good and I like that they give you a carafe so that you can refill yourself, maybe because the food is a bit dry?  My steak fajitas was not that great, dry and almost too much of that charred burnt taste as I think they really let them sizzle for way to long prior to serving them. The rice and beans were bland and cold.   I really wanted to like Ricardo's more than I did and it was actually disappointing to say the least.  Well I can scratch this restaurant off my list for places to try and revisit.   It was my birthday, not sure how they found out but they did bring me a tasty piece of complimentary flan with a candle and sung to me. However as sweet as that was, it was not enough to salvage the poor quality of fake Mexican/Spanish food they serve.  When the complimentary chips and dip is better than the meal, that is not a good sign!",

She told me the server did not know the menu and the real price was stated on the menu.How embarrassing of a manger to say her employee does not know the menu.  Like does she not train her employees as a manager so unprofessional. I think as a customer if her server did not know the menu and prices etc customers should still get granted for being told differently. Or her server should have not said a price if she was unsure.

She rang me up a small drink worth about $2 but charged me $10. My new bill after my gift card now totaled $35. It's actually quite hard to spend $50 here for two people, everything is priced pretty fairly. Also:   Literally all of the other restaurants I've used these gift cards at don't even care if you don't meet the minimum purchase requirement. Honestly the whole gift card thing wouldn't have even bothered me if it wasn't for her absolute terrible manor how she talks to her customers.

It's worth it. Hands down best mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only is their food top-notch, but the service is always friendly.   When we moved here from Phoenix we missed a certain appetizer our old Mexican restaurant offered (melted cheese and mushrooms inside a warm tortilla). While Ricardo's doesn't offer this dish, they're still willing to make it when we ask every time we come in, providing a little taste of home in the big city.  My #1 recommendation - The margaritas are superb. Order the largest one they have (we affectionately call it \"the trough\" in my family). Also, paying the extra for top shelf tequila is definitely worth it. You won't regret it.    Hope you find this review helpful.",

Sidenote: They used to have one of those Southwest-style-decor lookin cow skulls on a wall in the back dining room just to scare my little girl pants off. Haha!   I've grown up (a little) now, and the scary-cow-head decor is long gone, but I still love to come here whenever Mexican food is what I'm craving. Their margaritas are seriously amazing, especially the PRICKLY PEAR, mmmm!!! A pitcher pours you like four fatty margs, and for less than $20/pitcher, that's cheap as shit for the quality and the location. Seriously, I dare you to find a better marg in Vegas. Plus, everything that I've tried on the menu has been great, from tacos and tamales, to fajitas and chile rellenos. I don't think you can possibly go wrong with any type margarita or food you may choose to order at Ricardo's. :]  x",

Not my favorite cuisine but I was willing  and it's all we could think of last minute. None of us were in the mood for anything else. No sushi, no Mediterranean, no Korean, no Greek... so we settled on Mexican.  The servers name, and I'm not kidding, was Pancho Villa. He knew that was good for a laugh. Since my friend Joe speaks Spanish we got extra good treatment. Joe had a Margarita and Deb, a beer. There I sat with my water, casually mentioning to Joe that I prefer the frozen style Margarita. He rattled something off to the server and the next thing I knew, I had a frozen Margarita in front of me. Though I don't drink much anymore, I really appreciated that one and it was very well made.  The chips were really good. Not sure if they make them on the premises but they tasted like they sure could have. I love the chips and salsa thing, even though it tends to destroy your appetite and then you have to fight to get your dinner down.  Great atmosphere, service and the food was good. It was pretty typical Americanized Mexican fare but overall, it was pretty good. It didn't feel like a chain and I'm not even sure if it is. No matter, it was good and in the end, that's all that really matters.",

I noticed they had a huge lunch buffet table when we were getting seated.   Service was on point. Great staff. The chips were good, but I've had better salsa. The food was bland. I noticed that among our party of 6, none of us finsished our entire meal. The only reason I ate half of mine was because I didn't eat since 9am so I was famished. The food was no bueno. No wonder the restaurant was so empty.   I thought for same price, I would rather go to Lindo Michoacan. At least they give you that really good soup w/ your meal. Sorry, maybe I'm just spoiled by the many options of other restaurants. When they were asking if we wanted to go boxes, I was thinking to myself. Hell no!  I thought their portable credit card machine was cool. It even has a button for you to have the choice of leaving a 15% or 18% tip.",

Luckily we live in Vegas and there are restaurants that are open very late- so I found this little spot in the Southwest area.   We sat in the bar area, where they offered gambling as well.   I ordered a Medium size Mango Margarita- Delicious and was definitely very big!   My boyfriend and I shared the Fajitas for two, and we ordered half chicken and half steak. The fajitas came on a sizilling hot plate, with guacamole, pico, sour cream, rice, beans, roasted onions tomato's mushrooms and peppers topped with cilantro ..... YUM  They also give you free table side chips with salsa and bean dip.  I am not a huge fan of bean dip, but their bean dip was amazing.   The service was okay nothing over the top, and our server Kim was very nice, even when our order was messed up.   I had a great time and we had enough for leftovers. Definitely a great place for a midnight snack :)",

The decor was very ranch style which I liked. It made me feel like I was in Texas. They had wagon wheels and other cool ranchy things.   The service was great. We were greeted by our server within minutes of sitting. He was really nice but I cant remember his name.   The food and drinks were delicious. For starters they gave us some, fresh made, chips with a side of beans, salsa and pico. I ordered two tacos al pastor and it came with rice and beans. I devoured all of my food. My friends ordered a fish meal and a steak meal. The portions were perfect. The winner out of all of this was the margaritas though. They were so good. They had lots of flavors and come in different sizes. I got a medium mango and loved it. It wasn't too sweet or weak. I could taste the mango and it blended well with the tequila. Overall great experience.",

For a Saturday afternoon it wasn't too crowded and there wasn't alot of people in the restaurant either. Well as we were seated the immediately brought us salsa, bean dip, and chips which is typical at a mexican restaurant.  My aunt had an enchilada combination dinner, my cousin got chili relleno, and I got chili colorado burrito. They said their food was okay and mines was just okay also. This palate of mines is so spoiled and trained to Cali good authentic good mexican food and sometimes kind of hard for anything here to get close at times. And this unfortunately didn't make the cut. There are things I can tell if it came out of a can, if it was slow cooked, or how fresh out is. It's like how u can tell the difference between box macaroni & cheese compared to homemade macaroni and cheese. And nothing usually can fool me.  I probably won't be back but in my opinion they were just okay kinda meh.",

I ordered taquitos for lunch and the beef was so bland and not flavorful.  It was also smothered in cooking oil as if they took a shortcut to cook the meat.  It was just flat out awful and I would never recommend.  After seeing the burrito, which was not presentable at all, one could only wonder what was used in the chimichanga, because that also tasted burnt and no flavor.  The only thing great about our meal was my iced tea.  I also didn't care for the dumb mini tvs while trying to eat my meal, very distracting.  Will never be back, sorry.",

I do love that they give you two salsas and bean dip for your chips!!! I eat like two servings of dip on my own. Bad side is after the bean dip and chips I'm too full for my food. The flautas are good. Deep fried flour tortillas filled with chicken.   Corn allergy alert!!! They put corn in pretty much everything! So if you are allergic let them know.

We were ushered to a table in the lounge, but asked to be seated in the dining room.  We didn't know it was already closed, but nevertheless, the hostess seated us there.  Definite props for that.  We started with an appetizer combo plate, which was very good.  For the main course, I ordered Carne Asada, medium rare.  At other Mexican restaurants, this steak has an inimitable flavor. It came out of the kitchen fully well-done, and the only flavor I tasted was salt.  By this time, I was full enough from the appetizers that I just sipped my margarita and didn't have them replace it.  I knew that without that special flavor that I know and love, a less-cooked replacement wouldn't be much better.  And that's the big disappointment at Ricardo's.  The food just isn't worth the trip.",

I haven't tried the food yet, however my friend had their Huevos Rancheros and it looked amazing! The only reason I give them a 4 out of 5 instead of a 5 is because I had my mouth set on trying their Lobster Flautas and they ran out of lobster when I was there, and I live in California, so I'm not there often. I'm going back for my birthday next week, so hopefully they have an abundant and fresh supply of lobster... Salud!!!  Update: The Lobster Flautas are my absolute favorite! They are not your typical sized Flauta though... looks like they cut a regular sized flauta into 3 pieces so you get about 2.5 regular flautas combined... but they are so good",

Ricardo's is making chips for a mass of people, NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY RUDY!  I assure you, there is salt on the table.  Here is an idea, pick it up and use it!  \"Here's your sign.\"  Now for my positive review.  Ricardo's did a downright amazing job catering my husband and I's wedding.  Every single one of out 120+ guests loved the food and I am sure many will be revisiting the restaurant.  I didn't hear one complaint and everyone left fat and sassy.  The drinks and service were unsurpassed and management was involved in every single step of the way...free of charge.    I have been going to Ricardo's since I was a kid....20+ years.  The owner and his wife work Friday and Saturday and they know you by name and always have a smile on their face.  This is a touch of special for me, they are a great pair.  They have delicious food that I cannot seem to get out of my head.  The chicken Ricardo's is my favorite and melts in your mouth.  As for those chips and salsa you some ding-dongs seem to be complaining about.  Why are you complaining when you have a selection of three sauces?  You don't like one, here's an idea, try the other.  Most restaurants offer one selection and that's it.  What's the mean?  You don't like it and you are stuck.    Don't rely on the YELP reviews of morons, try it for yourself!",

For my lunch entree I ordered  the combo - choices were a chili relleno and a beef enchilada which also came with beans and rice. The beef enchilada contained shredded beef and was tasty and the chili relleno was yummy too.   The portion was large and I ate so many chips and guacamole that I couldn't finish everything.

My steak fajitas were great, seemed like everybody else likes them too cause I was 1/3 people who ordered them while I was there,  although I only really got 2 fajitas out of my \"serving\" ($15 something I believe), just needed more meat, had lots of veggies, good taste tho. My bf's carne asada burrito wasn't anything to brag about. May or may not be back.",

I mentioned that to a friend and he said - \"it moved to Flamingo road and Decatur.\" He said Ricardo's had been in and out of the MGM on a few occasions. Remembering the good time I had previously, I could not wait to try it again.  Ricardo's looks like a hacienda sitting on the corner of a strip mall. The entrance is tiled and the decor is very traditional - other than the many awards they have posted for \"vegas best restaurant. \"  The service was good - they thought I would want to eat in the cantina, rather han the dining room since I was alone..... but I got seated in the dining room eventually  The margaritas are made with Cuervo, and were very good.  The menu had an amazing number of choices ... and in addition the restaurant had a dinner buffet featuring a wide variety of dishes. Wanting to try a little of everything I went for the buffet and was glad I did.  Even tried a little fried ice cream to finish the meal.  A very enjoyable dinner.

I know some have complained  about the chips but ours was very fresh & warm. Bean dip was awesome as others have raved. Especially when dipped into the guacamole like salsa, which was very good. The other salsa (red) was somewhat watery & too mild.  I love breakfast regardless of time of day, so ordered Chorizo con Huevos & wife ordered the special Lobster seafood Enchiladas. Both orders came with rice & beans and Chorizo came with tortillas. Chorizo was cooked the way I like & tasted ok but lacked that reddish residue oil which would have greatly improved taste & moisture? Wife's Lobster enchiladas was great. She would order same again.  Beans were ok but better after adding some salsa. Rice was tasteless, bland & watery, like it was re-steamed? but better than dry undercooked rice like some restaurants serve. Again better when sprinkled with salsa. Flour Tortillas were wax paper like & thin similar to those low fat tortillas?  Service was great! Waiter continuously returned to check on us.  Would be 4 stars if not for the negatives listed above.  We would definitely return again. Especially since they are open 24/7 & food is good.  Understood, is that, everyone has their own taste! And everyone's comments, including mine, are therefore subjective.",

We had a good sized group of people and the restaurant was very accomodating giving us a the baquet room in the back. The first year we all got the lunch buffet. I don't personally recommend that. Its fine but as it is a buffet it is not always the most fresh. I prefer ordering off the menu.  The food is generally good. The taco filling is great whether it be shredded beef or chicken. The shell, however, is premade and fresh out of a box. The tamales are good. A nice balance of meat and mazza. The rice is on par with most other places. The beans are loaded with cheese. Tonight I saw the biggest bowl of menudo I've ever seen. I was amazed at how much of it a 10 year old was able to eat though he could not even come close to finishing it. I would not have finished one bite. I smelled it and and lost my appetite. It smells like poo. I mean no offense to all of the people who do like menudo. I just don't want my food smelling like the farm I grew up on. I'll pass. Everything else though is all right by me.",

    "text": "It was easy to get a seat, considering it was on a weekday night and the place was virtually empty. The atmosphere is inviting and cultural, with a comfortable vibe and color everywhere. The booth we were at even had its own little television to watch! I really like the decoration of the place, it definitely invites you into the experience.  Unfortunately, the food was bland at best. The bean dip with chips was okay, but the two other sides of what I thought was salsa and spicy salsa were too watered down and bland. Even the chips themselves didn't have any real kick or substance to them. I ordered the plan bean burrito, in which the rice was very bland and a little mushy. The burrito itself was nothing exciting, and I only ended up finishing half of my meal (and not taking the rest of it home with me).  My boyfriend ended up finding a long, thick black hair in his food. We immediately told the bus boy, and while it took the manager a good minute to head over to our table, she was nice enough on removing the item from the bill. Our server also gave us a free margarita in place of it. While having a taste of the margarita (and minding they made that margarita kick!), their server either forgot to card him or felt obligated to get him his drink for free. Either way, there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have asked for ID in a town like this. That automatically wanted me to drop this review down to a one star.  My conclusion is this place draws you in with the decor and beauty of the atmosphere, but it doesn't make up for the food. Ricardo's has a lot of potential if they offered new menu items if they decided to revamp what they already have with more flavor. Otherwise, I'd pass on this place.",

The owner really cares about this restaurant and his employees and it shows.  When he is there when we have visited he walks from table to table and asks how we are doing.  And most of the waiters and waitresses are very kind and your food will come out quickly after ordering.  Their complimentary chips with two different salsas and bean dip are delicious and are a perfect compliment to their amazing margaritas.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is plentiful.  Standard Mexican \"comfort\" food.  I normally get their steak and shrimp fajitas.  A nice side note... I love that this restaurant has credit card machines that go directly to your table to pay for your food - no sending the card to Siberia sometimes waiting for your slip to sign - the waiter doesn't even see your card.",

We usually sit in the bar area, the service there is always on point. And the booths in the bar areas have their own televisions, great for my sport-obsessed coworkers.",

    "text": "Last Friday night when my flight got in late around midnight I was ready for some hot grub, but not fast food.  So, after some quick research, yelp reminded me that Ricardo's is 24 hours.  It's been a long while since we've ate there because we're quite fond on Bonito Michoacan, but at midnight their doors were already long closed.   The first thing we noticed was that their prices are quite high when compared to similar restaurants in the area.  Being quite hungry, I ordered one of the steaks that was described like adabada style seasoning.  I was really disappointed; it tasted so bad I didn't finish it and I didn't desire a doggy bag to save it.  I just had them toss it out.  Bf ordered the Huevos Rancheros and said it was just OK.  I had remembered this place being much better in my recollections.",

The place was definitely in full Fiesta mode, complete with a live strolling band playing familiar tunes, and they took requests! The waiter we had was in the mood to be open to our general jovial ways, and he added to the fun. We observed waiters who often made their clients enjoy healthy belly laughs at their jokes, and everyone was being served from the bar as well as the kitchen in very reasonable time. Food and margaritas were delicious and we had a blast - and we are in the great grandparent stage of our lives. Ole' !",

I asked our server a second time and then the manager came by and informed us that the kids menu was for 10 and younger, making a joke that  fell flat about how my daughter needed to grow up and be a big girl and order from the regular menu. Why would a restaurant not allow her to order from the kids menu?   The food is priced acording to portion size any way, so whats in it for them to say no? The service was adequate but the experience was soured by the kids menu thing.  As for food its ok, i feel the food from robertos is far superior and less expensive.  Ricardos is a nice atmosphere for a meal, just dont bring your kids.",

The horchata is recommended and is included in the lunch buffet. Try it! It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste. I'm used to a more syrup-like consistency. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend to others. When I return, I'd like to try a margarita since they're known for having made the largest margarita in the world!",

Our party was seated in the buffet area with some literally having those lining up for the buffet rubbing up against them.   The carne asada tacos at the buffet were outstanding. The remaining items were all middle-of-the-road, standard buffet grub you can get at any casino buffet.  The staff was very friendly and did a good job keeping up with drink refills and clearing empty plates. I have yelped before that I am not a big fan of mandatory gratuities, especially eighteen percent at a buffet. I still think it is ridiculous, but after our waitress Debra told us she had been with Ricardo's for thirty-four years, it was a little more tolerable. Hats off to Debra for her years of service. Ricardo's must be a great place to work, as all of the employees I encountered seemed to be happy and eager to please.  The buffet was $12.50 including a beverage and was average at best, except for the CA tacos. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Average food.",

The place was nice and welcoming and the fact that it's 24 hrs is great! Who wants to always go to Denny's? So this is very good, but I was here for the food.  I ordered #14, taco, enchilada and chile relleno.  The good: the relleno and enchilada(cheese) were good, not excellent, but above average. The bad: the taco...I requested a hard shell taco with shredded beef. This is where authenticity comes in. Mexicans will relate; a hard shell taco is a corn tortilla folded and  deep fried with the meat inside. Then the cheese, lettuce and salsa are added by the eater or cook after. What came to me was a mission tortilla hardshell. Something you get at Taco Bell and Del taco, it wasn't good. This is what we call a lazy Mexican taco. Now, they might have their reasons, but I don't think it's reason enough to offer this atrocity. The beans were bland and undercooked and the rice was salty. I don't want to knock it too much, but, I hope this helps them improve. I will give it another try for breakfast.",

Not that it was bad. But definitely not worth the price. I got the shrimp and lobster enchilada and it came with beans, rice, and pico. Prior to our main meal we got chips with 3 dips (beans, green sauce salsa, and regular).  When I think lunch special, I think the meal should be below $10.00. I think my meal was the day's \"special\" but I did peruse the lunch special menu and most of the items were over $10.00. Mine came out to be $17.00 with tax and tip, ugh.  I like the setup and decor of the restaurant. It's also a cute touch that the female servers are in their outfits (sorry I don't know what their called).   I just don't know if I want to pay this much for Mexican food.",

Luis made great recommendations and Ever's services were on point. A definite must if you want great Mexican food off of the strip.",

The beans were way too salty. The rice smelled like dirty mop water. The pork tamale was probably the best thing on our plates. The Chile Colorado was disgusting, it was basically meat in a soup of red oil with bell peppers. Worst excuse for Mexican food ever! And is was extremely over priced, especially for the quality of food you get. Average of $12 per plate. For that price, it better be amazing, but sadly is just expensive disgustingness!",

It is THAT good.  I could eat that and the salsas only.  The dishes were ok.  I shared a trio of enchiladas - the verde salsa (not the special green sauce) did not agree with me.  Also the plates were covered with too much processed cheese.  The rice was dry.  I did not try the drinks.  Good Service, saw a buffet area with nice variety.  Not my vote for best Mexican in Las Vegas.  Maybe best bean dip though....",

I recently got married and decided to have my reception here. When I first made the reservations I was extremely excited because they were able to accommodate everything I was requesting which was not much and I believe not difficult. All I needed was a section of the restaurant to accommodate 40-50 people and have each table billed on their own check. I was not picky with food or anything else. I was told that they could do that which was great.  The agreement was I put a deposit of $250 which is nonrefundable and that will go towards the cake and our meals etc. We can apply that wherever and they will bill everyone by table.  Well come the day of they did not hold up their end of the deal. Instead they dont bill by table. Then I come to find out they charged people for soft drinks which was supposed to be included in the buffet option we chose. They give us the entire bill at the end after everyone already left. Yes its not normal for people to pay their own meals at a wedding reception but this was just for the family to have dinner with us it was not a typical reception. It was a small informal wedding.   Then they overcharged us!   We had estimated 55 people and ended up having only 40 people because of course people last minute dont show up. So I was thinking since they made a huge mistake which ruined the end of our night they wouldn't charge us for the people that didnt show up, as a customer service but NOPE! They still expected us to hold up our end of the deal even though they did not hold up theirs.  Even though the food was great I wouldn't go back because now when I think back to my wedding night THATS WHAT I REMEMBER.",

The price is EXTREMELY affordable for so much delicious food. The lunch buffet includes the all you can eat buffet, a drink, AND chips and salsa all for the price of 14.50!!! Like what??? Sure it's off the strip but it's still less expensive and tastier than other buffets on the strip. And to top it all off, the service is amazing :)",

I usually always choose frozen option, just too delicious. You get served 3 dip options and salsa. Food - we choose Steak fajitas and Lobster egg rolls which was split between 2 full size people    We also got sides of guacamole, sour cream , beans and rice along with mini soft tortillas that we didn't order I guess everyone gets it.

This however, took longer than general for a server/waiter to attend to us. Pardon them for the crazy mass of diners. They were trying their best you can see. Alright I'll say it, they needed clones. Somebody had a birthday and they were able to squeeze in a song for that celebrant.  Drinks and dessert... Oh yes! It's worth a non-meal. Oh but the purple margarita was a bit sour. Go with the blue.

Nobody waited on us for at least 15 minutes. Finally a waitress who had been standing at the counter apparently doing bookwork or figures finally walked by and said she would be with us in a few minutes. The place had about four dining room customers. Apparently that was four too many for them. Customer service is definitely a low priority; we finally just got up and left. I wouldn't waste my time with this place again.",

If you are in a hurry, the lunch buffet is very quick and offers most Mexican restaurant staple items.   As for ordering from the menu for lunch, be sure you have a little extra time as the service is more of a dining experience than a 1-hour lunch service.   Ricardo's has been in Vegas for a really long time serving Mexican food and their margaritas are pretty good too. It feels like a family owned and run business, which is a good thing.",

    "text": "As a fan of Mexican food, even I'm a bit surprised I've never eaten at a Ricardo's restaurant before.   The best thing about Ricardo's are the chips and salsa. These chips are fresh and you get three different kinds of dip. The bean dip is my personal favorite but all three were very good.   The rest of the food is not as good as the chips unfortunately. I ordered the Carna Asada plate. I expected thinly slices carna asada, marinated in lime juices. I got a top sirloin steak that was dry. I shouldn't have to saw into my steak like a lumberjack taking down a redwood. The plate did come with a cheese enchilada, rice, and beans, which were actually good. It's possible that Ricardo's knows their meat was going to be disappointing so they throw in other food in there.  If you were thinking about the lobster flautas, you should keep looking as well. That one is disappointing as well (bland and dry), and that meal doesn't come with enchiladas or rice. Non-meat items are probably the way to go.  As for drinks, we got a small margarita. It wasn't terribly bad. Not a huge fan of margaritas in general. I tend to prefer margaritas that have some sweetness to it but the alcohol should still be tasted. This margarita was all sweetness.  It's not the worst Mexican restaurant. If you want some late night Mexican food and you rather not deal with the shadiness of Roberto's at night, this is an acceptable substitution.",

My mango margarita as large and strong. The Baja fingers were spicy and perfectly cooked. My carnitas plate was well seasoned and flavorful- some of the better carnitas that I have eaten. I like little homey details like pulling a whole bay leaf from my dish. My server didn't completely understand me but he was polite and generous, and a second server came out to clarify my order, just in case. The only thing I really didn't like was the peppery room-temperature cabbage salad that accompanied the carnitas plate. All in all, my boyfriend and I will be returning to Ricardo's and hope to see consistency in this quality.",

Around 2:00 am I come strolling in ready to drink happy hour margaritas (they're better than regular margaritas) and chat with my favorite bartender Miguel ! I have never had a regular bar I go to but Miguel is hands down one of the best bartenders in Las Vegas! Ricardos wouldn't be the same without him. He makes the best micheladas,margaritas or anything for that matter . The food here is a solid 9/10 the chicken fingers and Mexican pizza is among the best items. Happy hour chicken taquitos for 5 bucks always gets me! As you have read the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is a 10! Been here for lunch one time but wasn't the same as the dining experience you will get after midnight during the week with Miguel!",

It recently fell into 'on the way home' when my job/bus route changed, so those margaritas have been extra appreciated.  Last night I wasn't planning on going in, but I was in a sticky situation with some guys at the bus stop. I went in and asked Miguel the bartender if I could just sit inside for awhile since I felt unsafe. I can't say how much his kindness and thoughtfulness means to me. He went so far past 'above and beyond'. He really took care of me, and normally I can take care of myself, but it wasn't working last night. I'm not sure what might have happened if I hadn't walked into Ricardo's. But Miguel was definitely my hero.  I already recommended Ricardo's regularly, so I can't do it anymore than that now. But I will endlessly appreciate the type of people they employ, and especially Miguel.",

That day I came to eat because I knew I could count on it being: easy, fast, good quality and everyone in my small group of 3 people would be able to find something they liked. What I got was something more. I had been suffering from a emotional incident. As I sat there eating....trying to just get through the day. Feeling like I was all alone in the word. I was very sad and speechless. Just then I heard a sweet voice behind me  say \"I brought these for you\" as she sat down on the table a bowl of Spicy Carrots. You see there normally are spicy carrots and jalapenos on the buffet. I like to eat lots of them every time I visit the buffet. Some days I will drive out of my way....just to eat the Guacamole Salad with a plate of carrots. But, that day there were no carrots to enjoy. Your female employee not only noticed I was not the same that day, But went out of her way to make every guest (me) feel important. She will never know that little act of kindness will stay with me forever. She is management material and I hope her bosses see that in her too.",

It was caked with dust which was falling into our food, drinks and you could see the dust in the air.  The food was really gross and soggy. It wasnt flavorful at all. The tables were caked with dirt. Somebody had actually scratched the caked dirt on the table and wrote 'dirty'. How can you not notice that when cleaning? The plates were chipped and had some dry food caked to it.

Accommodating and charming without being overbearing. It's very obvious that it is a family run business.  We were greeted with fresh refried bean dip, salsa and chips. I expected the gesture to be lackluster but it was exceptionally good. Well seasoned and fluffy. As an appetizer we the mexican pizza and it was delicious. Huge! Honestly we could've shared the mexican pizza and gone home - it was that filling.  As an entree I had the chicken fajita style chimichanga. They meat was flavorful and moist. The cheese was perfectly temperature'd so that all the flavors could be tasted and enjoyed. The beans were as incredible as detailed above. The rice was good, definitely held its own, but wasn't as strong as the other dishes.  The service was incredible. Attentive and grateful. Accommodating and kind. The value was impeccable! Our total bill was $50 (no alcohol). Not bad for everything that we had. Plus, I bought plenty of food home.  I will definitely be back. Without question.",

    "text": "This was a good experience for me while visiting Las Vegas. My son took us to this restaurant because it was Cinco de Mayo. I wasn't expecting much, but much happened.  I didn't know what to order, so I asked my sons friend what to eat, they said just go for the buffet and go for the enchiladas.   I sampled the chips, salsa and avocado dip and it was good.  I could of ordered some flour tortillas, but I just headed to the buffet and got rice, beans, pork, beef, enchiladas and trimmings. I have to say that I don't like enchiladas because most times it is made with las palmas sauce, but not these.  These were just cheese enchiladas and are the best I've eaten in decades.  They had a magician named Rokas who had been on television's Penn and Teller TV show that came to our table and did some card tricks that were pretty cool.  They had 2 musicians with guitar and accordion playing Mexican music.   This was a great time with good food and excellent service.",

    "text": "My meal was actually going quite while until I bit into something that shouldn't have been there.  Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant proudly boasts of being established in  1979. They occupy a standalone building at the northwest corner of Flamingo and Decatur; my guess is that they've probably occupied it long before becoming part of the sprawling mess of a plaza which is now home to such businesses as Planet Fitness, Smith's, and Zero Degrees.  I went here for a group dinner event. Judging from the group menus section of the Ricardo's web site, we had the #4 option (priced at $32.95 per person, before additional costs for drinks and dessert).  Chips were the starter, and they were pretty nice with a non-spicy pico, a non-spicy refried bean dip, and a mild-medium avocado sauce - then again, when has chips and salsa not been enjoyable? This menu also came with a house salad, which was a nice treat with vinaigrette and tortilla strips. As for drinks, the small margaritas were addictively sweet and not too inebriating, and I didn't look beyond those.  I chose the Chile Colorado entree, which was tender sirloin beef cooked in red chile, onions, and various spices. The beef was good aside from some tougher, drier pieces, and the mix of flavors was delicious until the buildup of salt became an all-out assault on my palate. The refried beans, relatively mundane rice, modest helping of shredded lettuce, and puffed tortilla bowl didn't do much to distract me. I did enjoy the side of roasted, buttery corn kernels though.  Unfortunately, the salt wasn't the only issue. A little over halfway through, I bit into something far too tough, which I soon realized was the corner of a plastic bag. You can't have that kind of stuff in people's food, yo. The saving grace is that I haven't gotten nausea or diarrhea as of writing this review several hours after the meal. Even so, I'm still disgusted at how careless and unprofessional the kitchen staff are.  By the way, I picked flan out of the dessert options. It was pretty boring.  I can't see myself going back to Ricardo's despite enjoying large parts of my meal. I have experienced similar or superior quality cooking at sit-down Mexican restaurants all over town, and those places didn't include inedible items.",

Ricardo's Service: The staff is always friendly and so attentive.  I still love the fact that they drop off a carafe of Ice Tea for the table, and keep them fresh.  The woman working the lunch buffet was so sweet while she prepped your street tacos.  Ricardo's Lunch Buffet:  At my last visit most of the food offerings were pretty bland. This visit, EVERYTHING was tastier, fresher and everyone noticed.  The buffet looked exactly the same but the quality vastly improved.   Now that the lunch buffet seems to have gotten an overhaul, I definitely won't wait another year until the next visit.  Well done Ricardo's!",

But the rest of the food the enchiladas, the rice the beans, I can't think maybe there are several other meats to choose from on the bar tacos but the point is it all tasted so Bland that I wanted to cry for spending 14 95.

Its actually kinda funny since my husband I go there so much we know exactly when the BIG BOSS MAN is there just from the way the staff act...Suddenly we get the best customer service from the waitresses and waiters, & our food comes out super fresh & pronto!  BUT only when BIG BOSS MAN is in the restaurant otherwise you get lazy hostesses & so so service.  We ate last night, we were greeted by the staff which was amazing because normally the hostess has her head down as if she is too busy.   (Busy with god knows what when the restaurant is empty???) Tonight must be different  ahhh, I figured BIG BOSS MAN must be in.  The waitress took our order, food came out, super fast & fresh!  Wonderful.  We ate then waitress was no where in sight.  Ahhhh, BIG BOSS MAN left for the night.  BOO HOO.  Our waitress didn't come back to check on us to give us our check for another 15 minutes after we were already finished eating.  From what we have noticed, BIG BOSS MAN aka the owner is usually in late evenings after 9:00pm.",

    "text": "The food is just OK. I remember when Ricardos used to be a great place for Mexican food.  Today, not so much.  The main reason for the single star is how tue staff treated a 12 year old girl.  When asking for a kids menu for her the waiter actually asked \"are you serious\". He then leaves the table and comes back a few minutes later and ask if we're ready to order. Mind you he did not bring a kids menu. He was reminded that we had asked for one and he actually said \" I thought you were joking\". A couple minutes later this old biddy comes by with what looked to be a kids menu and says with a real snarky attitude \"children's menus are for 10 and under\". She the proceeds to snidely comment at the child \"you're a big girl now\".  Some people you just want to smack. But seriously, what's the big deal, she's a picky eater that doesn't eat much. So instead she was forced to order a full meal which she maybe ate 30% of. What a waste of food not to mention money. I'm not saying I won't go back to Ricardo's, but I guarantee it will be at least 1 year from now. With that and maybe this review dissuading at least one person will cost them more than if they would have just let a kid eat a kids meal.",

    "text": "I'm a semi-frequent visitor to Vegas.  Mexican food is my favorite, so I went online to check out reviews and decided to try Ricardo's.  There was a crowd out front, so I almost didn't go in, since I was traveling for business and was dining by myself.  I thought the host of people outisde indicated a queue inside for a table, but it turns out that the 'queue'  was just smokers.  Having to walk through a cloud of smoke was a bit of a turn-off, but tt is what it is and I went inside.  I was seated immediately.  They have an extensive menu.  I was waited on immediately for my beverage order.  I order a marquarita and ice water.  Margarita was very good.  They offer a small, medium and large.  Other reviews commented that their chips, beans and salsa were good.  Their chips come with a guac dip, tomato salsa and beans.  The guac dip and beans were great, but the tomato salsa was very bland; there was no flavor.  The chicken enchilada was very good in flavor.  The chicken could have been cut up a bit more; it was in big chunks.  The carnitas taco was very good.  The rice was full of vegetables - corn, which is typical for Mexican food, but it also had peas, carrots, green beans and lima beans.  I've never had Mexican rice with these vegetables in themn before and did not care for it at all.  The service was good up to the point of getting my check.  It seemed to take forever and I ended up having to ask for it.  I put a credit card in the check holder and after waiting a lengthy time, was presented with a handheld credit card machine where I had to run my own card and punch in my own tip amount and print out my own receipts.  I've utlized self-service tablets at restaurants before, but this felt like I was doing the waiter's job as this was not a True self-service tablet.  The decor and ambience of the restaurant was good.",

Then, to my disappointment, I found out they had to relocate!!  After two hours of getting lost on Flamingo in the total wrong direction, we finally found it.  And never shall we part again!  Ricardo's has some of the best chicken taquitos Ive ever had in my life!  Everything else is GREAT too.  It all comes down to the sauce and cheese doesnt it?  Sauce and cheese over already great food?  Come on now.  If you are a drinker, you wont be disappointed here either--they offer these HUGE margaritas and let's just say you can tell this is their specialty too. So if you are looking for a mex food fix in Sin City, just drive about a mile past the Rio and Ricardo's holds the corner spot in a strip mall.  You won't regret it...  Oh, great chips, salsa and service too.  I believe they even have Mariachis, at times.  Or maybe that was just the Margarita making the pictures sing.",

This time we came in with some friends, and sat in the main area.  We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff. I have to give some credit to our waitress as our group had two english only speakers, one spanish only speaker, someone who was bilingual and a child. Our waitress was able to easily switch back and forth between english and spanish to assist us.  The salsa has definitely improved since our last visit. The medium was really chunky and the mild had much more flavor. The chips really are incredible here...probably the best I've had it town. Very crunchy, a bit oily but they are also very large.  I had the taco salad. Its more of a hard shelled burrito than a salad. There is lettuce, but there are more beans and cheese than lettuce. The salad also has guacamole, salsa, sour cream and olives. I had without the meat, but you can get the meat on it. The portion was huge. After indulging in chips and salsa, I maybe conquered half of it.  This place does have a roving magician/balloon animal artist. He was a little less aggressive than others I've seen, which was nice.   We definitely had a better experience, and will probably be back.",

They offer a happy hour of half price appetizers and drinks between 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm.  Last night my husband and I ordered four appetizers to share.  The waiter commented that we seem to be ordering \"a lot\" of food, which, actually should none of his business.  I made the comment that I liked to have leftovers for my lunch the next day.  At that point he told me that no \"to go\" boxes were available because they don't make money on Happy Hour and they don't want people coming and eating one item off each plate then taking the rest home.  So I guess they would prefer for the leftover appetizers to be thrown away, rather than allow their customers to take the appetizers home that they already paid for??  Doesn't make sense to me so I won't be going back.",

YEARS later, to my surprise, he still works at the remaining location. loved it then, I love it now. I can't say the service or food is mind-blowing but I like the ambiance & appreciate the consistency & the tradition of dining there. The chips & salsa are always yummy in my tummy & devoured in the blink of an eye. I almost always have the fajitas. They are perfect, except the tragically disproportionate onion/bell pepper/mushroom ratio: 96 onions, 2 green peppers, 1 red pepper & 1 mushroom. I've since started ordering the veggie ones. Don't be alarmed to see broccoli, carrots & cauliflower added in lieu of the meat. The texture & flavor is out of this world. There is a lunch buffet patrons favorite, as well. Their chile relleno isn't the best. The chile Colorado is flavorful. The enchiladas aren't too shabby. Their strawberry margarita tastes mildly of tomato. But, overall, I highly recommend this Vegas oldie but goodie for your Mexican food fix.",

    "text": "Don't waste your money or time. Food was absolutely HORRIBLE! We ordered the fish taco's with rice and beans & two house margarita's. Fish Taco's $14.95 and had absolutely no taste at all. Clearly the kitchen doesn't taste what they send out. It was very fast though ... probably microwaved. No lime/spanish seasoning/flavor what so ever. And the deciding factor? This is our second time because we thought we might have caught them on a bad day two months ago when we tried them. I used come here in the 1980's and it was always awesome and you had to wait to get in. No so anymore. Very few customers. The frozen cod called fish is flavorless as is the rice. Try Jalisco's up on Durango and near the 215. Worth the drive and has authentic flavor. They also are friendly with excellent prices far below this worn out old, canned sauce, microwave tasteless fare. Too bad. It used to be the \"gold standard\" now it's worse than Del Taco. I warned you!!!",

    "text": "Yesterday I went straight from work to the LV Wranglers game, to see them get smoked by ontario. Needless to say, after a 10 hour shift at the pool, an awful hockey game, and 2 double jack and diets, I was craving some good mexican food. I used to live in San Diego, so I'll admit I can be a little snobbish when it comes to authenticity. So, I'll just start with that: this is not authentic, but still tastes good. From the start I was unsure what they were trying to be. From Flamingo I could see drink-promo banners and a neon \"open all night sign\".....standard for Vegas. The hostess wearing a flowy, brightly-colored salsa-dance dress led us past the gaming bar, to our booth which had a miniature television tuned to ESPN.  See why I was confused as to their overall goal? But, then they immediately served bean dip and 2 kinds of salsas with slightly stale tortilla chips....but don't worry I still ate them all.  I ordered steak fajitas and the steak, peppers, onions, and sauteed mushrooms (?surprise!) were all very good. The condiments, tortillas, rice and beans, were only so-so.  Overall, if you are tipsy, hungry, in the area, and its late night.... then its worth a stop-in. But, I wouldn't drive out of my way for it.  However, I did grab a handful of Vegas mags on the way out: LV Weekly, Dine Out, Where, and CityLife..... all of which satisfied my Sunday morning coffee-reading ritual. So...thanks for that, and for my boyfriends bean-breath.",

My husband also experienced bathroom issues that are still ongoing 5 days later, feeling faint, and pale. I believe it was their \"albondiga\" soup which actually did not look like meat meant for human consumption, it was very questionable looking, tasting, and weird texture, I'm thinking it was probably cat/dog/rat meat. Horrible waitress service, would not make space on table, I literally was holding empty plates towards her for over a minute and she would not take them off my hands. Space on table was so limited that I ate with an empty plate on my  lap and no staff made any effort to clear out table or make room on table. Will likely report this restaurant to health district.",

When our food was brought out the plates were hot but my food wasn't as hot, that I don't like. I ordered a beef enchilada & chili relleno & was so dissapointed (I've tasted better) it was very disappointing my chili relleno was very bland no taste at all $13.00-14.00 for a 2 item combo is RIDICULOUS!! Especially because the portions are very small for the expensive price paid. My husband ordered a chili Colorado burritos & had to pay $1.00 extra for all meat because he didn't want all the beans which he ended up getting anyway his plate was about $15.00-16.00 which is RIDICULOUS!!  $40.00 for 2 people & I didn't even order a drink is sad. We were better off going to a little taco shop or Roberto's up the street. Very dissapointed we won't be going back",

The bartenders have made some custom margs when requested that I and my guests have enjoyed.  Their green salsa is one of my favorite salsas of all time.

Our Margaritas were wonderful in taste and GIGANTIC in size; dinner dishes were absolutely delicious and sufficient in quantity. We also loved its warm and crispy tortilla chips, as well as the two different salsas and bean paste! The HOT version of salsa could have been a touch spicier, though.  - The hostess and waiting staff (waitress and the one who brought out chips and water) were friendly and efficient. Our waitress was also quite helpful in offering her recommendations and explanations of house specialties.  - The restaurant is huge and its Mexican decor tasteful and inviting. Some quarters can be very nice for private groups. Yes, it has a nice, intimate bar area, but one can have HH anywhere in the dining room, too, besides its bar. We will definitely go back to Ricardo's again!  Peterskis, Mar 2012 ----",

You can nit pick about anything in any restaurant, but if you want a real Mexican food experience that isn't one of the million Roberto's in town, this is perfect. Our server Jeronimo was really nice and helpful, and knew a lot about the food. I got the taco, enchilada, and tamale combo plate, and the shredded beef was marinated perfectly.  My girl got the lobster and shrimp enchiladas, and she loved them. The chips and salsa came with two different types of salsa and bean dip, which were awesome. A great place.",

    "text": "The good:  This is a nice space, with traditional Mexican restaurant decor (of the American-touristy variety), high ceilings, and a huge frosted glass skylight.  The service (at lunch on a Friday) was quick, friendly, and attentive.  The margaritas were well-made and reasonably priced.  The chips were fresh and hot, and came with three kinds of salsa - all good.  The bad:  Most of the food was over-spiced, dry, or both.  I'll give them a pass on my food, because I had the lunch buffet.  The buffet was pretty much indistinguishable from the Mexican station at any hotel buffet.  But my wife's combination meal off the menu was pretty much the same.  She also ordered some cheese-only nachos, which had obviously spent too much time under the broiler and tasted burnt.   We will give Ricardo's another chance, but for now I can't say that this is the \"treasure\" of a Mexican restaurant that we always hope to find when we try a new one.",

The smalls were a pretty good size, margarita tasted great.   - Waiter also provided a free basket of chips (with regular and those black nacho chips) with 3 dips (salsa, bean, guacamole).  Even though we weren't ordering any food when my friend asked for a chips & dip refill the waiter happily obliged with bringing us a new batch of chips (both types) and dips (all 3 types). - So, awesome service.",

The bottomless salsa trio and chips is just the starter, but is easy to fill up on and not be able to eat your meal. Had the shrimp and lobster enchiladas and they were FANTASTIC! Mostly lobster made them even better. As someone else posted, they have a barbeque pork sandwich, which my teen ordered, I was thinking, it can't be very good from a Mexican restaurant. I was horribly wrong! He said it was one of the best sandwiches he had ever had and it came with fries and a large side salad. The service can't be beat! Very attentive, never an empty glass on the table and they're extremely friendly and always smiling. Will continue to go back again and again.",

First we walked in and weren't offered a seat or menus, we eventually figured out that we had to do that ourselves. At the end He was taking so long to pick up my card to pay, so I walked over to the bar myself to save him a trip back and forth and me some time as well. He took forever even noticing that I was standing at the bar waiting for him to run my card. When he finally took my card he asked me if it was mine...?! He then ran it in front of me and asked for my pin which then prompted me to give a tip amount... Now this is when it got uncomfortable. I asked that he not run it as debit and instead run it as credit to print out the receipt so that I may take it back to my table to figure out the tip in private and not while he stood there rudely staring at me. He then got upset when he canceled the transaction and tried to do it again but the machine died which pissed him off further... While being flustered he completely forgot to run it as credit again and made the same mistake AGAIN and when I tried to point it out to him he began screaming and telling me to put the tip amount and that it was supposed to be a simple thing. Pretty much embarrassing me at the bar and telling me to just put 0 for his tip... I explained that I wasn't trying to not tip him and that I just felt uncomfortable doing it that way.   I myself was a server and know that I would never put down the bill in front of someone and ask that they put the tip amount down while I starred them down. He would have gotten a tip had he not yelled and embarrassed me for HIS NEGLIGENCE.",

However, do not go fit the buffet it was bad!!! Small selection and food quality was bad!   The service was BAD!! They took our drink order late and the food came out 30 minutes later and all we ordered was menudo and a quesadilla... How long does that take!?!   Im giving it 2 stars because the menudo was delicious and the quesadilla was really good. But if it wasn't for that they would get nothing!!!   Sorry Ricardo's this is the last time we go here, it's not worth the drive off the strip for bad service",

    "text": "This family-owned and operated fine Mexican restaurant was first established in 1979, with more than one location, but now has only this one place, on the NW corner of Flamingo at Decatur.  The food is terrific, the service is superb, and the live entertainment (when they have it) reminds you of an old-style Mexican cantina.  I dine there as often as I can, and it's a 10-mile trip in one direction, but well worth it.  They have been voted the #1 Mexican restaurant (in the Las Vegas Review-Journal poll) for 22 years, since first making that prestigious list in 1983, 29 years ago.  On October 19, 2010, Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant and ROSANGELTM Tequila broke the Guinness World Record for \"World's Biggest Pink Margarita.\"  In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, ROSANGELTM, the world's premier hibiscus-infused tequila, gave the Margarita a pink hue.  A portion of the event's proceeds benefitted Susan G. Komen for the Cure of Southern Nevada.  Ricardo's and ROSANGEL's new Guinness World Record for the \"World's Largest Pink Margarita\" was certified at 7,627 gallons, surpassing the previous record of 7,039 gallons.  To break this record Ricardo's used a 14 ft. tall 10 ft. wide tank, 4,600 liters of ROSANGEL Tequila (1,215 gallons), 5,000 gallons of spring water, 750 quarts of Kelly Y Gonzalez lime juice, 750 gallons of La Paz Sweet and Sour, 1,500 liters of triple sec (396 gallons), and 20 pounds of salt.  This record-breaking libation will make a total of 81,355 -12 oz. pink infused margaritas.  \"There is nothing more rewarding than being able to involve one's profession with charity.  We are truly grateful to have the ability to give back and have people really enjoy themselves.  It's a mega-feat for a mega-cause,\" said Scott Schiller, brand manager for ROSANGELTM.  \"We are beyond excited to break the Guinness World Record for the 'World's Largest Pink Margarita',\" said Ricardo's owner, Bob Ansara. \"After over a year of planning this event it is exhilarating to make history and complete this project.  We are so grateful to celebrate 30 years of business and could not think of a better way to celebrate with our community.\"  \"Susan G. Komen Southern Nevada is so grateful for the generosity of Bob Ansara.  Eighteen months ago, he had this grand vision and never once lost sight of the tremendous charitable aspect of this event.  We are honored to have been chosen as the recipient of such benevolence and are truly touched by the friendships we've made,\" said Stephanie Kirby, executive director of Susan G. Komen for the Cure of Southern Nevada.  That's yet another reason why you should visit them; to claim that you've actually been to a place where a Guinness World Record was set.

I do not normally eat much mexican food and I had no heard of Ricardo's before as i've only been in Vegas a few years.   The service was great, we had a really cool waiter who was on the ball the whole time. The chips were good and came with 3 dips (salsa, bean, green dip) to snack on before the meal.  I have not been eating alot of red meat in general lately but Carne Asada is a go to that usually is great no matter where you go.  I think it was probably my fault, I wanted just some carne asada tacos but instead got a whole carne asada steak huge meal that was hard to finish.  It wasnt bad but not what i was expecting so i was a bit disappointed.  Everyone else loved their dishes. It is a pretty high quality Mexican restaurant. I think it might be a bit expensive but I did not get to see the tab as it was picked up by another member of our group.   I would go back but I would be more careful ordering next time to make sure I actually got what i wanted.",

My boyfriend got his salad first and it was so watery, he tipped the plate to the side and atleast a fourth cup of water came off the plate. ewww, he was grossed out, so then I got my cesar salad and it was also old lettuce, and very watery/ soggy. The leaves were so wet that it watered down the dressing and also LOADED with water at the bottom. I am not sure maybe they didn't spin their lettuce.... The main food was good I have to say and usually always is.... tasty.He got the Chimichanga and My kids got cheeseburgers and chicken strips... they liked them. The fries are really good by the way... The chips and salsa and bean dip is the best. So Ricardo, if u are reading this Step it up on ur salads... they're swimmin.......",

I handed the bill To the cashier and proceeded my transaction, but then you get the \"Manager\" who comes over looking very rude with an attitude and upset because there is 2 forms of payment. When I tell you this guy must of been on something it was ridiculous. Mind you my mom is a Pediatric surgeon, my aunt is a retired college professor and the rest of the family are all pretty well to do. I say this because it's not like it's a first in restaurants for us. O well great customer lost. I'd be Leary if you plan on going in a big group.",

My dinner was good, maybe one of the bests it's ever been, however both of my other guests the next day had HORRIBLE food poisoning. One of my guests got so sick that he had to even go to a local UMC hospital.  The only answer we can assume is that it was the type of chicken they had, as I had different style of chicken and have had no ill effects. It's a shame they had to get so sick, because now after hundreds of visits and thousands of dollars spent, this place is now on top of our blacklist, and we won't return. In the end, if you visit, stick with grilled chicken if you want chicken, because never again will shredded be looked at the same by us.",

My wife had the enchilada, Chile relleno and I had the chorizo con huevos . Both were good, the chorizo was home made and took on the look of sausage, but was tasty nun the less. The wife really enjoyed the Rellano. My only concern is the margarita we had, the wife had it on the rocks and I thought I had a blended? But it was from a slushy machine, which appears to be the trend in Las Vegas. In my opinion it was way too sour and I can only assume this is how they're made here. I will hit this place again and explore the menu but my next margarita will be on the rocks as anything but a blended drink is an affront to the margarita purist. Personally I think this is an expedited but lazy way to serve a drink.",

Didn't get his name, but he was very unhelpful and didn't seem to care about our table. 4 guys who just came in from the pool who were obviously starving.  We were not rude, or demanding... we actually were being so patient.  So here's what happened and why he became upset, and left for long periods of time. He came back to finally take our order. We were ALL ready and knew what we wanted. And right as my friend started to put his order in another friend interrupting and said \"can we also get more cheese dip\" as he really liked it. The waiter was stunned by that and then just walked away. I tried stopping him so we could put our full orders in. He just kept going. Then he didn't come back for about 15 minutes. He brought the cheese dip and then put his fingers together saying \"I'll be back un momento\". Okay. I guess. Lol. Then he was gone for a good 30 minutes. He did a Bday table and then took an order of another table who came in after us.  Asked another table next to us if they were okay. Then literally checked on every table except ours and then disappeared again. Completely ignoring us. Then a good 45 minutes into waiting. He finally came over. Said \"are you ready to order or would you like some more queso?!\"  Okay!!!  Seriously. What an ass. Then our order took so long. So we got up and went to leave. Manager apologized and said she'd take care of it. They said the order was ready, but it took another 10 minutes. Lol. It wasn't even ready. We ended up leaving and didn't even get to eat. And the girl refilling our water and chips wasn't friendly at all. And ONLY one of us at the table voted for Trump. And that was Mr Queso. But don't punish the rest of us Gringos. So racist. Will I be back again?  Yes!  But I'll make sure I'm more tan and wearing a hat and sunglasses. So annoyed with the service here. Not good for business.",

It's beautiful inside, they would do better if they could have done type of event schedule like Mariachi on some nights..Karaoke, just to bring in more customers. The food is good, but all in all no matter what you order the bill climbs up there by the time you order. The menu is set up to make you end up paying more than you should? I've been here with friends for lunch and its still a bit  too steep for that. They don't have special lunch prices..etc. To me, it's a 5 between 1-10.

Great service =)  They do give chips, guacamole (GOOD guacamole) and dips before the entrees. I ordered the Chicken Ranchero and my boyfriend got a Mexican pizza. The portions are big, chicken was juicy, sauces and spices are bold and give lots of flavor to the dishes. Mucho bueno. It was enough to pack up and have for another two meals.   Real authentic and delicious meals. I love having multiple little dips and plates of different options in front of me (which is probably why I love AYCE sushi and Korean BBQ so much too.) Some entrees give you so many sides to add on to your meal, which is fun. And there's huge margaritas! Fiesta ;-)",

Alas, impeccable service with completely bland food does not  make it much better.  They make guacamole tasteless. That is hard to do! The beans are a salty mushy baby food consistency. Even the Iceberg lettuce seems to be wilted from embarrassment...so like I hope to have conveyed, do not go here. Unless forced to by the inexplicable love of the place by one of this town's hardcore, been here forever people. Then, you go, try not to eat and \"forget\" your take away after a truly fascinating two hours of \"How We Built Las Vegas\" commences.   Again. 2* food, the servers are soooo nice! But my frientor is a fixture here. Not sure it would be the case for all...",

Any way I took the opportunity to really compare the two ordering almost the exact same meal at both locations.  The food here at Ricardo's was good solid food - nothing special that made me think \"Wow, this is the best Mexican food I have ever had!\" It did however help me better understand that there can be differences in Mexican restaurant food - it was not really in the same league Javier's was as far as the food - Javier's really is a high end Mexican restaurant which I never would have guessed existed (the high end restaurant part...)  Ricardo's was fine, the service was excellent and the atmosphere what you would expect.  I would visit again as overall the experience was good and the cost reasonable.",

Their food wasn't as good as it usually is, and my chicken had a bone in it. I completely understand things happen, and hopefully it was a rare case. I don't understand that they didn't really take it all that seriously. They just took the bone away and said sorry. Whenever I had a problem with my food, the restaurant would give a small discount or at least take it seriously. Honestly last night changed my opinion of this place quite a bit!",

Finally the food itself was okay the chips and salsa were good and the nachos as the appetizers were good but I was really disappointed in the enchiladas I thought they would taste better then what I thought they were terrible the meat had a weird taste to it and the sauce tasted like bland nasty gravy overall did not enjoy the main course overall outside of that everything else is good and I can see myself returning again one day.",

    "text": "We have been in search of a great, local Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas for quite some time.  My husband has lived here for 20 years, but I've recently moved from California, which is where we would usually indulge.  After driving by this place for the last several years, we finally decided to give it a try, having friends with us from out of town who were craving some tacos and margaritas.   The ambience is great, the service is really good, and the food was better than we expected.  My husband and I shared the chicken & shrimp fajitas, with were extremely generous.  Our kids and friends were happy with their entrees, as well.  The adults each had margaritas, which they offer in different sizes, and kids had Shirley Temples & Rob Roy's... very fancy!   With their chips, they serve a few different types of salsa and warm pinto beans.  Their entrees are appropriately priced for the large portion you get.  We managed to save room for dessert, and ordered deep fried ice cream and flan.  SOOOO GOOD!   On the evening we dined there, they had a magician roaming around to entertain the diners.  Initially, we were a bit put off, but he was so entertaining that we asked for his business card before he left.   They are usually pretty busy around dinner time, so keep that in mind if you are hungry and don't want to wait.  So far, we haven't had any problem getting seated right away, but you never know.  It's not too far off the strip, so you can easily take a cab without having to pay for a drive clear across town.   Overall, we have been very satisfied with our dining experiences here, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try a good, local Mexican restaurant.",

They even give you refried beans with your sauces.  Margaritas are strong and a reasonable price.  Food was pretty good as well. Only con was the service. They weren't very attentive at times.  Over all great place.  With good food and don't forget it's open 24hrs!!",
