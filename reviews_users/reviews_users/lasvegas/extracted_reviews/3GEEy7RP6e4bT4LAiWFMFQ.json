Helped us figure out all the choices and we tried 4 different pizzas. My favorite was the New Yorker. Also tried the beer battered fried artichokes and they were the bomb! The sauce was amazing! Really cool environment and the energy was pumping. Everyone loved it!",

The employees here are all very friendly and helpful when it comes to deciding on what you want to try. Service is quick and efficient.  Sadly on weekend nights it can be a bit loud, but that's to be expected. They offer countertop eating and take out so you do have options if you don't want to eat inside. The decor is a bit random, but the food is great.  One thing that I don't like is that they charge 50 cents for a side of ranch. If I'm paying $12+ for a salad I shouldn't have to pay for sides of ranch.  Other than that no complaints! If you love pizza, you must try this place :)",

Large menu with almost took many pizza options. 450 degree 600 degree 900 degree etc then all the styles and sizes almost overwhelming. Drinks are a little pricey but good and over all menu is a little higher than you'd expect in that area but it's Vegas. Be prepared to drop 18-24 on a pizza and 14-20 on any other dish pasta etc. I believe sodas were 3.50. Nice atmosphere and very clean. Restrooms are clean as well. Nice seating and a lot of tv's on to watch sports and people watch. Staff was friendly and nice. Can't give five stars today's due to cost alone but other wise great place.",

This pizza is very much an artisanal variety, so for people with picky palates I'd recommend their New Yorker pizza before moving on to the more eclectic fare.  Be sure to try their meatballs as an appetizer, they're perfect! They also carry a jalapeno beer that may sound odd and unappealing at first, but from a beer connoisseur, please do yourself a favor and try it.",

I was worried it was all hype, like a lot of newer places can be in this part of town...but I was pleasantly surprised. We have eaten there 5 or 6 times now and each time has been a great experience. I'm in love with their Formaggio Board and the New Yorker pizza with flavorful sauce, sausage and other fresh ingredients finished off with an even smattering of cool ricotta - oh yum!  The service is also always friendly and attentive.   One thing: I do wish they would put the dividers back in to the little alcoves on the side of the room with the curtains. It was great for a little romantic dinner amidst all the bustle outside of the curtains. Last time we went there prepared for romance and met with another couple who were also seated a little too close for comfort with no divider! Well, hello there! :)",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated my 50th birthday last weekend in Las Vegas and I chose Pizza Rock for my birthday dinner.  We started with their version of a caprese salad; tomatoes, mozz, kalamata olives, peppadews, basil and some balsamic dressing. I use most of those things as topping on my pizzas and it was a good start to the meal.   Then came the pizzas.  I wanted to try two different styles of pizza so we ordered the Diavola \"Classic Italian\"- style pizza with vine-ripened tomato sauce, mozzarella, sopressatta, arugula, hot red pepper oil and parmigiano-reggiano.  The crust was baked pretty nicely but the pizza was extremely over-topped.  It was just a big soggy mess.  Furthermore, it just wasn't that flavorful or even spicy for that matter.   The next pizza was their \"World Cup Winning\" Margherita pizza.  They only make 73 per day and I guess we were early enough to get one of them.  I decided to add honey calabrese sausage to the pie.  Unfortunately when the honey met the high heat it just caused it to blacken.  It tasted OK, but it wasn't the right choice for Neapolitan.  As for the Neapolitan pizza itself, I was disappointed here as well.  Although this crust had more taste interest than the Classic Italian crust, it was only because of the charring.  There was no spring whatsoever in the rim.  It was just flat as a pancake. The cheese was utterly forgettable and everything slid off the slice when I tried to pick it up.   As were leaving I kept thinking to myself that I didn't choose the right pizzas on the menu and my suspicions may be correct.  On the way out, I looked at their to-go slice operation.  The NY-style pizzas looked quite good and that may well be this restaurant's forte, but I won't know until I return to Las Vegas at a later time.",

This time was just to walk in and grab a slice to go at their front counter. The guy was nice enough, and made our orders with a quickness. His kitchen area wasn't the cleanest, and the counter looked as if it hadn't been wiped down since before their lunch rush (and it was about 5:30 when we went in). Not the best first impression for my friend who'd never been.   My slice was still good by the time we'd walked home. The crust was crispy in the outside like I like, and fluffy on the inside. A little heavy-handed on the sauce, but the sauce is solid, and didn't disappoint. The ricotta on the pie was a nice, creamy touch.   I want to take him back for the full experience next time.",

It has a great atmosphere and really good pizza.    We ordered the old Chicago.  The crust was a little burnt (minus a star) on a few pieces, but overall the crust, sauce, meat, & sausage were all tasted great.  Their selection of beers were also very plentiful.    Another pizza place in the valley that shows this city continues to grow.  I'll definitely be back for more.",

    "text": "Looking for someplace to have dinner on/near Fremont St. and had heard nothing but praise about this place, so we gave it a go. We walked in and were seated immediately. Nice, authentic and laid-back (if quite literally dark) atmosphere. The menu has a great variety of items - practically any type of pizza you can imagine is likely on it. Of course, they also offer typical Italian fare, e.g. pasta, and have a surprisingly wide array of salads to choose from. I opted for the classic Caesar and it was good; everything tasted fresh with a nice balance of croutons and cheese, and it wasn't drowned in dressing like many Caesars tend to be.  Now when it comes to pizza, the plainer the better for me; I typically like a classic margherita, no bells and whistles. The Ms. is a bit more adventurous than I am, though. Still, we decided to go well out of our comfort zone this time, and tried the Detroit Red Top - it's a square-style pie, cooked in steel pans imported from Detroit (says so right there in the menu's description) with the sauce atop the cheese, hence the name.   The Red Top's crust is noteworthy for its buttery yet smoky, quasi-burnt (in a good way) taste - in fact, it was slightly overwhelming, but again, not necessarily in a bad way. In fact, it was absolutely delectable - sauce was robust, the variety of cheeses all meshed well together - but, man, was it filling! I had two slices and was beyond sated. \"Heavy\" doesn't begin to describe it. I'd say we ate around 8 pm or so...I wasn't hungry again until around noon the next day. Good thing we were staying in a suite furnished with a kitchenette (no humblebrag, honest!), so I could refrigerate, reheat, and enjoy it over the next couple or so days we were out there; it does reheat quite well, by the way.   The Red Top isn't cheap at $27, but considering the quality of what you get and how much of it you get, that's a price you just deal with, I guess.   Overall, excellent experience. I got what the hype and acclaim are about having visited here. Definitely merits a return trip (where I'll probably try their version of my old standby margherita) whenever we get back to LV.",

But they have a full bar and a dining area in the back. We were lucky enough to get the sausage and stout pizza, which they only make 23 per day. This was an interesting yet awesomely flavored pizza! The dough had a mild Guinness flavor, the caramelize onions and toppings added a sweet flair. I would definitely recommend this if you would like to try something out of the ordinary. I also tried the Mai Tai which was freshly made and an excellent drink choice. This place is definitely worth a stop when downtown!",

We had the Vedura (?) basically a veggie pizza, but we added sausage, and a large family style Caesar salad. Add a couple of beers and it was a solid and satisfying experience meal. The pizza was amazing. We ended the meal with a slice of mud pie and rolled back across the street (because \"the itis\" was kicking in). Definitely will come back!",

If you're lucky enough to have Alex as your bartender, he's super friendly, Very knowledgeable about beer selection and is Excellent at suggesting a beer or cocktail to suit your tastes. He also grew up in Vegas and gave us great ideas for things to do and see in town.  When you come to Vegas, make sure you make a stop into Downtown Pizza Rock, sit at the bar and let Alex make your experience  totally awesome!",

    "text": "On my last visit to Pizza Rock, I knew I had to bump my rating up to 5-Stars.There's a reason why this restaurant receives plenty of accolades: their pizzas, as well as their other menu items, are bomb.   Salad - Pancetta & Arugula: The crispiness of the pancetta reminds me of Bacos, but you know, better. There's tons of arugula, so if you like the green stuff then eat up! As for me, it was too bitter and I don't have an acquired taste for it. I would've enjoyed the salad more if it was mixed with other greens. But don't get me wrong, it was solid. Their Gorgonzola and Apple salad is a little sweeter, and I prefer it over this one.   Pizza - Picante: Having a penchant for spicy foods, the Picante's a pie that made me perspire a bit from its serrano, banana, and calabrese peppers --- If you order this, make the server's job a little easier by requesting that he or she leave a pitcher of water on the table. Oh, before I forget, the crust is perfect. It's not too thin, not too thick, and it has a delightful crunch.  Other eats - For appetizers, try the Calamari Fritti and the Moretti Battered Fried Artichokes. As for pizzas, The Cal Italia remains one of my favorites, but their Romana pizza is divided into three sections and offers different topping combinations.  Other - I haven't seen this place packed beyond maximum occupancy, but it does get busy. Go ahead and make a reservation anyway.  Service - Great.  Overall - It'll be hard eating anywhere else in Downtown, knowing that Pizza Rock is nearby. But if I have to eat elsewhere, I'll be fantasizing about Pizza Rock.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock Pizza Rock. I am torn. Certain ambiance elements were cool, others reminded me of the old Planet Hollywood restaurant level of cheesy.   Had the Cal Italia pizza. I enjoyed the offbeat sweet/tangy/salty take on traditional pizza. This pizza is for the curious and adventurous. It was good, and I'm glad I tried it but now it's checked off the list, I wouldn't order this as my standard.  Some at out table were into just plain old good pizza, so we also ordered the Chicago Crisp Michigan Ave. It was well received. The thin crust was great!  The service was off. They were changing shifts, so our server introduced the new server. Then we never saw him again until we hunted him down for the check. The first server kept serving us until that point, so it was just weird. I could kind of tell she was supposed to be off work by that point because our service went from awesome when we were sat, to not so awesome after she introduced our new server and then he never came back. So, yeah, disorganized would be a good word for it.  One thing I loved? The MUSIC! When Downtown, I'd go again to try a beer and the Margherita pizza at some point, or maybe just another one of those Otter Pop Cocktails (yummy) to hang & listen to music.  Other than that, I will stick with my favorite local coal fired place close to home.",

    "text": "This is now my second run-in with pizza made (or rather associated with) Tony Gemignani. He's well known in San Francisco for being a world pizza champion and owner of Tony's Pizza Napoletana. My first experience consisted of a long wait, which was all I could recall. I guess the pizza was less than memorable.   A local B-list celebrity chef opening a spruced up rock-themed pizza joint in Vegas? Why do I have a feeling this is a setup for failure. It's just a feeling. First, the good. I like the concept of offering different styles of pizza made from different oven types. They are very temperature specific ranging from the hottest wood-fired oven, an electric brick oven, and down to a gas brick oven. The Cal Italia, made from the latter oven was a winner for me. It was also crowned the winner of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. The crust was perfect - lightly crispy on top with a mostly chewy consistency. The sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction paired with the prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano was a home run.   The bad. The menu is way too large. I tried the burrata burger, which was awfully salty with the bacon mixed into the patty. I could barely taste any of the burrata due to the over seasoning. The meatballs and truffle fries were average.  The ugly. The margherita, the supposed World Pizza Cup winner, was burnt to the point where we had to ask the waitress to return it. I know my pizza and the occasional blistering of the crust, but this was beyond that. It was black all around as well as burnt black flour underneath. All I could taste was the bitterness of the charred crust and of regret. A wood fire pizza cannot sit in a 900 degree oven very long. The saving grace was a very apologetic and helpful waitress.   I like the large space and the fact that there's a big rig in the middle of the restaurant, but the atmosphere cannot entice me to return. For a city that prides itself on offering free parking in most places, the downtown parking situation was abysmal. Street parking was minimal and most of the offerings around Pizza Rock were at one of the local hotels that offered valet (free only with validation). Oh, I also happened to use the restroom before leaving and witnessed a guy vomiting and retching profusely in the stall next to me. To be fair, I cannot say if it was from the food or the alcohol. Let's just leave it at that.",

They have some decent happy hour specials that are worth looking at.   Edit: I forgot to add they have Gluten Free pizza as well. A couple people in our group ordered GF and they were both really happy. Said it tasted like \"normal pizza\", which if you have ever tried most GF pizza, that's a huge compliment.   The only downside, which isn't their fault is the parking can be a challenge... street with meters or pay lots scattered around.",

The Monday Night Football game had just started and Pizza Rock was less than 10 minutes away from ending happy hour.  $3 32-oz PBRs and appetizers, $5 garlic bread, and $7 individual specialty pizzas.  We asked the waitress to make sure she was back before happy hour ended and we quickly put together an order of a ton of appetizers to share as well as PBRs and individual pizzas for the group.    For appetizers I tried the fried green beans, garlic bread, and meatballs.  For my pizza I had the Cal Italia which apparently won the food network pizza champions challenge.  They won't get any argument from me on that distinction; it was well deserved.  All of their food was incredible, and I really wish I had more time in Vegas to try more of their menu.  I can't wait to go back; Pizza Rock will definitely be a must stop when I do.",

    "text": "Went with my family and parents. We got the Detroit pizza and the New Yorker. Overall wasn't bad. The New Yorker had a bit too much sauce and not enough cheese. The pepperoni, although tasting good, is the kind that curls up when it's cooked, a sign of a cheap product. The Detroit was good. Nothing special though. My daughter and son are allergic to cheese so we got them a pie with just sauce, pepperoni, and bacon. According to my daughter it was the best cheese-less pizza she has ever had.  The atmosphere was questionable. It was a Saturday night around 8 when we got there. It was crowded which is a good sign. Lots of TVs  that had the college games on. My big complaint was the music. It was bumping so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other without having to scream across the table. Not cool. It was like night club loud. Then around 9 o'clock, they turned the game off and put music videos on. Music was still just as loud. That was a big let down.  Overall, it's a good place to try out. The pizza is WAY overpriced for the product which is average at best, but given the location, it's about exploiting the tourists. They have a carry out counter up front to get slices at, which is a nice idea.",

    "text": "After escaping the strip and realizing that DTLV was way more my speed, I was still a bit hesitant going to Pizza Rock. I mean--could this place *really* be worth all the hype?  And the answer? Yes.  I agree with Nate M that Pizza Rock looks like it could be a douche-tastic Guy Fieri concept, but thank Gaga it's not. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Sure, there's a truck parked in the middle, nbd.  Once you realize the spiky-haired fellow had nothing to do with it, Pizza Rock earns lots of cool points. Sure, the decor is a bit outlandish, but hey--when in Vegas...  The service here is outstanding. Our server was so fun--I wanted to be her bestie. She was fast, attentive, friendly, and just the perfect amount of snark. She also made fantastic food suggestions.  Speaking of the food, we started with a caprese salad, and it was the best I've ever eaten. I couldn't stop eating it... I may have licked the plate. As for the pizza, I had a gluten-free cal italia, which was also delicious. Picture it: cheese, prosciutto, fig jam, balsamic reduction... it was the slam. GF crust tends to taste like cardboard, but not at Pizza Rock! And in a city that either doesn't understand gluten or just sticks their head in the sand, this place was a much-needed respite from a week of explaining how that damn little grain makes me sick.   If you're in DTLV, you HAVE TO come here. As I sat here writing this review, I caught myself drooling a little bit. Yep, that's how good PIzza Rock was. I cannot wait to go back.",

We settled on the New Yorker and the Bianco Tonno Classico with yellowfin tuna. They were both okay, but nothing great! Tasted like a pizza back home that would cost half the price. If you're downtown, maybe it's worthy of a visit, but don't waste your time if you're not in the neighborhood.",

If the customer doesn't feel welcomed, they will look for another place to eat and spend money.   Our waitress Jessica was amazing, she came over and was funny, attentive and honestly, she made us feel like we were at her house for lunch!  Jessica and the food were 5 star!!   We ordered the famous Cal Italia  .  Very good, delicious actually.   Nice fresh flavors, great crust with a toasty bottom.     The Fried green tomato  caprese was our appetizer of choice and let me just say;  amazing   Presentation 5   Taste and quality 5 Star   Oooh my goodness.   Like WTH have I been missing in my life??

Our waiter was nice but lacked on following up with us a few times and we had to wave him down about 3 times for service. Place wasn't event packed to have received that service.  Food - Portions of food was perfect and the flavor was good, maybe a bit on the oily side.   Prices - Reasonable on the prices.  Parking - Lot of patking garages near by.  Venue - Large place with cool hip decor with private rooms, somewhat separated bar area, Semi truck inside and regular dining area.   Overall the reason for the 2 star vs. A 4 star is to the lack of customer service and follow ups. I would come back but would hope for better service.",

My son and I had the 3-meatball appetizer, which was yummy, and then we got The Mob Boss Sicilian-style pizza.  It was huge - service tray huge.  The crust was thick, but really crispy on the bottom and light and airy in the middle.  the toppings were generous.  I loved the pepperoni.  the best ingredients for me were indeed the pepperoni and that awesomely crispy crust. It was large enough that we were full and still took home at least half the pizza.  Next time, i think we will want to try a few of the other really good looking appetizers. I've heard that there is a minimum that you can spend for them to validate your parking, but I do not know what that is.  They did validate our parking slip, which I really appreciate - that being the deciding factor on whether I would go there the next time we are feeling hungry on the fly, since otherwise parking would be very pricy.  Overall, an experience that I would repeat. I enjoyed the food, driving up Ogden to get there was very easy, and the personnel were all very nice.  That is the formula for a good night!",

It was covered in sauce-- literally ladles poured on top with no cheesy goodness not even a little cheese stretch or saltiness that I was hoping for. I would describe it as sauce and bread with some tasty bites of ricotta squirted in little circles around the pizza. I think if there was less sauce maybe the saltiness from the cheese or meat would have shined more but all I had was sauce. The quality is good but just lacked the umami I think a pizza should have. The pepperoni pizza was simple and delicious just as it should be so we all ended up sharing that and leaving the New Yorker barely touched which is so sad since I hate leaving a pizza like that which is why I had to take away a star. If you're a sauce and bread person the New York one would be good for you!",

Some of the foods I like most here are the various pizzas, the meatballs and fried green beans. All of it has a ton of flavor. I've also had sandwiches here. Yesterday I got the Italian Trio sandwich. The bread was chewy and crusty. I like that but this was a little much. The meats and arugala were good. As was the rich goat cheese. The spicy peppers were a good contrast. There was a bit of balsamic on the bread that went a long way pulling everything together. But in the end, the sandwich was kind of dry. It could have used some sort of spread. The fries on the side on the other hand were amazing. Garlic rosemary fries loaded with both. I was tasting garlic for hours afterwards. It was amazing.",

I watch other patrons come in and he caters to them withno problem.  Granted I eat here at least once a week and have never had any problems here.  I wish I could get my tip back because I dont appreciate this kind of service at all.  Hope other reas this and stay away if the black guy is behind the counter.",

It was 1230am on Sunday morning too. Decent amount of people here. The pizza was just ok. It was happy hour so we got fried zucchini, truffle fries and 2 times Tom or something like that. It was an individual pizza. Not bad but food took forever! And our seats were warm next to the pizza oven. Overall, won't go out of my way to be back. Just ok to try once.",

    "text": "I decided that I wanted to spend my 40th Birthday in Vegas.  This was the first place we decided to come to for a little lunch before checking into our hotel.  We found parking outside right in front ($2.00 per hour) and walked inside.    Walked up to the front counter and and was asked how many.  No smile or welcoming, just a blank stare from the \"hostess\" (Sunday, June 10th around 12:30pm).  She asked if a high top table would be ok, but I'm never a fan of high tops if other tables are available.  She led us to a regular table just to the left of the big rig truck.  She dropped off our menus and was on her way.  Sure as fuck wasn't friendly.  Anyways.....our waitress was super nice and made up for the nonchalant shitty vibe that the hostess had.  We ordered our drinks and my buddy arrived a few minutes after that.  He got his drink and then we ordered our pizzas.  We went with a Detroit Red Top with pepperoni, and a New Haven Lou.  Here is how they were.........................  New Haven Lou-  This one sounded great....white pizza with spinach, meatballs, and ricotta.  Unfortunately, it was just alright.  The crust was bomb (nice and blistered and charred on the bottom...great chew, great texture), but the toppings were kind of meh.  The ricotta overpowered everything, and got cooled down pretty quick.  The meatballs were sliced nice and thin, like I love, but even those were lackluster.  It kind of looked like gyro meat on the pizza and the meatballs didn't have much flavor.  The spinach was fine.  I think this pizza may do better with some of their red sauce.  We tried to power through this one, but left a few slices remaining and wound up giving them to a homeless dude across the street.    Detroit Red Top-  If you come here, you should definitely get this!  I had this pizza previously at Tony's place in San Francisco last year on Father's Day.  It was bomb!  One of the best pizzas I have ever had!  Happy to say that Pizza Rock's version is right up there with his SF location.  It's a rectangular pizza cooked in steel pans from Detroit.  They use Wisconsin brick cheese, white cheddar, mozzarella and pecorino romano for the cheeses, bake it in the pan so that the edeges get all crispy and crunchy, and then layer the sauce on top once it's done.  WOWZERS!  This pizza is fantastic!  A tad oily on the bottom crust, but it was gosh darn delicious.  The blend of cheeses are incredibly rich and tasty, the sauce melds well with everything, and those toasted corners of hardened/crisp/burnt cheese are the best part.  If/when I come back to this location, or go to ANY of Tony's pizza joints, I will always order a Detroit Red Top.  Super delicious!  Like I said earlier, our waitress was awesome and on top of everything.  Prices were fair for what you get ($75 after tip for 2 pizzas and 2 sodas..I guess a little high?), and the pizza was legit.  Minus the \"hostess\", this was a damn good first stop in Vegas.  I will continue to think about that Detroit pizza for weeks/months/years to come.  Simply amazing!",

A solid food menu with a far reaching drink and beer selection (sourced from around the world) gives you new items to try every time you visit. I have already been exposed to around a half of dozen new beer brands that I have added to my lexicon and I haven't scratched the surface of what they have to offer.   I usually go straight to the bar to drink and order where the bartenders are always attentive and impress me with their knowledge of their beer options. From here I am in view of any one of the many large screen televisions that surround the eating areas adding to the enjoyable experience.   Pizza Rock works well with groups as well, with tables and booths to choose from. I went with a few coworkers and the timeliness and quality of service did not drop off with the more people that visit.   Pizza Rock even features a to go section where you can order slices and whole pies to go along with specials for to go orders. An all around all star location situated on the downtown scene.   Well done Pizza Rock.",

Points deducted because they advertise that they only make 73 margherita pizzas, but there is no way that is possible. We ordered 3 at 11am and when we asked the waitress when they usually run out of pizzas, she said they never have. Impossible! Or just means False advertising. The New Yorker is one of their other award winning pizzas and I would highly recommend it! Delicious! Savory pizza sauce, just the right amount of meat and the ricotta on top was the perfect addition. The margarita pizza was good. The crust is airy and nicely charred. However, I've probably had better. We also indulged in their bloody Mary's. Really good! Pleasantly surprised. Spicy and tasted like quality ingredients had gone into it.",

Very large restaurant   A couple of things I didn't like They should take one seat out on each side of the bar, it's terrible to eat and drink and be concerned about poking your neighbor which happened all night  We ordered a pizza from the bar, it was delivered to us in exactly 61 minutes. That's way too long to wait for a pizza.   We were not given silverware, then we also had to ask for plates  The pepperoni pizza was very salty tasting on half the pizza, don't know how that could happen. The half that was not very salty was actually very good.   And finally had to eat with our coats on, fortunately the people were sitting so close we shared body heat  All in all Marty O'brians Pizza Rock rocks much more than this one. I guess I was spoiled going to Marty's place first",

Whether I'm there with work buddies or my wife, our go-to is either the Rosemary Garlic or Truffle fries, the New Yorker pizza or the Chicago pizza. You absolutely cannot go wrong with any of those. You'll also love the menus, as they are printed on old vinyl records. There are always super cool tunes being piped in and oh, not to mention the semi truck parked in the middle of the restaurant.

The options were limited, but I did like the daily special and the diavolo.  It didn't blow my mind but was good nonetheless.  Prices were decent and service was quick.  We also tried the calamari..  There were both spicy and mild versions.  The spicy was decent but a bit too salty.  I would have preferred a sweeter marinara sauce than the one offered.",

I ordered a Chicago thin crust wood fired at 800 degrees pizza. I got meat balls mushrooms black olives. It was $29.00 for a large. I took it back to the 4 Queens and ate half of it. I put the rest in the fridge for another whole meal. It was nice and crispy and chocked full of toppings.  I'll be back next trip for sure.",

Were not locals so I guess I won't be trying this place out and I typically frequent Vegas every Memorial for Punk Rock Bowling but I'll stick to my usual pizza join Evel Pie.  I'll contact Evel Pie and other places who won't turn business away.  No reason given either as to why they won't accommodate are party.",

Super cute on the outside and inside, walk up window or inside seating. Walls painted black, crystal chandeliers, and a huge semi truck all in the same room, and they made it work. So the food, we ordered the margarita pizza, the owner won a pizza contest in Italy for it so that was a no brain er,  and a pear, walnut and Gorgonzola salad. Nice server, took the order, then never came back, it was not busy, finally someone else brought everything out at once, we didn't care about that after all it's a pizza place. The salad was good, about the same as that salad anywhere you go, but the pizza was cold! We had to call the server over to see if maybe it was supposed to be served that way? Nope, he took it back, and brought us a hot one. It was good, very simple good crust, tomato sauce just like in Italy, and yummy mozzarella and basil. Don't know if I will go back, sure they don't care given the location, just not stellar. I live right downtown and am always looking for places to support down here, but....... Oh yes, if you go make sure you mention it if you are local, cause no one asked us so no discount!",

I can't say much about the food as I only had a personal pepperoni pizza (which was totally MEH), but I can definitely say the service, for the most part, SUCKED.   The hostess was eager and friendly, however, our waiter was kind of a douche (which kinda fits the atmosphere, I guess). Perhaps he's never worked in service before, because his demeanor was totally whack. When we asked him if he had certain toppings, he was confident in telling us that the owner would NEVER carry that and that he would have to agree with the owners decision. Like, really? Thanks for the opinion we didn't ask you for, man. Perhaps we annoyed him because we took so long to order, because once we finally did, he was nowhere to be found! We waited FOREVER for our food (which was served by other people? maybe it just works that way there?), then waited another forever for our check. In fact, I think we sat there for a good 45 minutes before one of us finally got realllllly bored and actually requested the bill from a totally different waiter. The totally different waiter was nice, by the way.   To be fair, this place does have an extensive beer menu. Perhaps it'd be good for some happy hour drinks at the bar, but I will definitely not go here for food.",

They had gone the day before and absolutely had to go back ( that says tons in itself). We were not drinking so we had Las Vegas Coolers which were refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. We decided on the New Yorker and the Frank Nitti. The Nitti has thin crispy crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The spinach had good flavor and texture. The ricotta was the perfect touch. The way it was baked was perfect! The ingredients were balanced to let you taste everything on the pizza and not focus on one ingredient particularly. The New Yorker lived up to its name. The crust was a little thicker and had a great consistency. What stuck me was the sausage. Such a distinct fresh flavor!!! Amazing... The sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. The meats were all delicious and generous throughout the pie. Come here tell your friends to come here!!! I never say that in reviews but the food and service most definitely warrant. Next trip to Vegas will definitely include this pizza.",

The walls are covered in diamond plate, there is a big rig 'zanily' coming through the wall in the dining room. Even the rafters have poker-suit cut outs (oh right! I totally forgot I was in Vegas for seven seconds). The big deal-breaker though was the TV's. There are dozens and they are all turned up to 11. It was similar to Buffalo Wild Wings.   I'm a huge fan of the original(?) Tony's Pizza in North Beach so I was happy to make the trek out to Downtown from the strip. This pizza is extremely similar but I just wasn't prepared for the startlingly different, and in my opinion worse, atmosphere.",

The mob boss is delicious, the regular pepperoni is delicious, the fried zuchini also delicious ... all the things I didn't get to try looked delicious!! The only reason I took away a star was for the overpriced fried artichoke . It was just 2 pieces of artichoke, the size of a small drumstick , for $9... Although yummy, not worth $9 at all. And they charge for ranch, but the ranch was amazing so id probably pay $.50 all day long for ranch ... But to sum it up, there's a good chance I may need a trip back to Vegas just to eat here again ..",

We did have to wait but they have a great texting system so that you can still enjoy Fremont St or gamble while waiting for your table. Loved that. Food was excellent, great beer and good martinis.

    "text": "You know I can't tell you how long I was looking forward to finally eating here. It was a real highlight of my move to Vegas. I had talked with the Pizza Rock Twitter for months leading up to me coming out here and was told I\"would be taken care of\" when I first ordered here. I had no idea what that meant but I thought it was really cool they were taking care of their loyal fans or something.   So I didn't feel like going and getting food and having to take it back on the bus or walking. Luckily I found a bike service that would actually deliver to my apartment. How cool was that? So I went and finally got a hold of Pizza Rock and talked to the guys and just said \"oh by the way the twitter said I would get taken care of my first visit, whatever that meant\". Then it was like I was trying this huge scam, Tommy the manager was trying to help, but he tells me to go back to Twitter and talk to them. Then Twitter backtracks and says they never said anything and starts ignoring me. At that point I'm beyond done.  I decide forget about it.   I call back to try to explain to the restaurant maybe how to fix this and get put on with GM Ricky who immediately takes an antagonistic, smug, and condescending attitude with me. Saying how he is going to say \"take care of\" means we'll take care of you and I'm basically stupid for thinking anything more and basically just being an all around dick. Pretty much saying I was trying to scam them or play entitlement for some free food. No worries, I told him to go F himself. It's a shame but if that's the kind of people Pizza Rock wants to hire, they get what they deserve.   As I type this, I am eating 40 dollars worth of Happy's Pizza. May not be top quality, but gave me 100% less headaches. Should have been Pizza Rock's money but can't support a place that has people treating loyal fans and first time customers the way GM Ricky was.   Shame on you Pizza Rock.",

I think the place feels like business people have money to try and look cool but not quite getting there.    Who care?  Pies are good.  You gotta be impressed with the amount of money that went into buying all those ovens.  Most pizza joints boasts only one.  The variety on the menu is impressive and some choices are inventive.  I especailly liked the farmer's market special.  I mean they are within walking distance of the third street Friday market, they should take advantage of it and make a pizza out of what is fresh that day.    The pizzas are huge and tasty.  The clams that we got were huge and tasty.  I can see people hosting parties there.  There is plenty of space and pizza is good grub to feed a lot of people.  There's also a takeout counter.  I think they serve folks at the Downtown Grand too.    Get there during happy hour.  Get the meatballs for cheap.  :)  What is the best thing about the place is that the people working there are receptive to reviews, right then and there.  They really want to know what you think.  That is always a plus for me.",

Our Lyft driver made several food recommendations  but his main one was Pizza Rock.  He raved about the food and service.  Unfortunately we could not do the same.  We were seated immediately, sat down and the waiter came around asking for our drinks and order.  Since it was our first time, we asked for water and a few minutes to look over the menu.  We never got our water, however the table next to us got refills on their water.  We walked out after close to 15-20minutes, the place wasn't even busy for a Saturday night.  For us to not get a simple glass of water was no excuse.  I've tried to give downtown Vegas a break.  It seems as though it always lets me down, we'll just stick to the strip from now on.",

Came here on a Thursday night, totally opposite.  Had great music with matching videos from 80s and 90s.  Spoke to manager and he shrugged it off and let the terrible music continue while the place was empty... Bad service and comments by manager, don't come here on a Saturday night. Bad form pizza rock.",

    "text": "It was awesome...  So on a last minute decision I ended up going to Vegas this past weekend and stayed at the Main Street Hotel which is a different review altogether.  Based on the location of my stay going to the Strip was just not that easy to do so ended up walking Fremont and getting some stuff there...  So after walking down and getting a beer or two, ended up at Pizza Rock on everyone's recommendation around there.  Ordered a pizza and the meatballs...couldn't have chosen a better appetizer and a meal. The server was awesome and the selection of beers was just as good.  The meatza was cut in squares, which makes it easier to handle. The meatballs were saucy but I needed a little more and it was glorious. I will definitely try to make it again to Pizza Rock if I happen to be in Vegas.  I highly recommend this location, try to go there before you fill yourself with all the other delicious foods in Vegas!",

    "text": "I wavered between 4 and 5 stars. For what it is, it's perfect.    I know if my kids wrote the review, it would be 7 stars. It's noisy, trendy, great for groups, has a lot of visual appeal, service is very good.   Located across from Downtown Grand and a stone throw's away from the Mob Museum, on a mini restaurant row of a clean and quieter part of the 3rd street.    I've visited before with my work group and everyone left happy. Altogether, I've been here 4 times and last two I only ordered drinks while the rest of my party pigged out on giant pies, burgers and fries, hence the reason for downgrading the rating. I love the atmosphere, just can't get into the food here. It sounds amazing and looks good, just somehow misses the flavor. Now, if you are on vacation, all bets are off and nobody is watching the scale- that might do. But when you live five miles away and still have to fit into a pencil skirt in the morning- throwing caloric caution to the wind is only appropriate if the food is REALLY worth it. If it's just ok, I'll have a cocktail and call it a night. Of the things I have tried here, I would say calamari is my favorite. Not under or over fried and not full of shady fillers of fried celery and carrots.   Definitely more of an atmosphere place on which Pizza Rock delivers nicely.",

We even had a small dance party with them making our 10 min wait fly by with fun. Never have I been treated this way by any restaurant, you guys are doing it right with those two up there.  They were exactly right, waiting on a perfect big booth to accommodate our party of 8.  The place smells amazing the minute you hit the door.  After being seated we were immediately greeted by our server Kathleen .  I will definitely request her every return. Drinks came out fast, our order was perfect, & she also seemed like a real person(not a scripted robot). I don't know how people on here have complained about the meatballs.. These things are BOMB!!! Definitely a must try & especially for the price!! We ordered a few different pizzas. New York 22\" was so delicious and plenty to feed most of us.  We also tried the cal italia. My favorite pizza by far!!! If I was with only a couple friends this would be our #1 choice, just wish the size was larger. Also tried the Romana II. Omg 3 delicious pizzas all in one! Great choice if you are very indecisive like me!! Overall I loved this place! Excellent atmosphere for the younger crowd! I'm already planning my next bday party! While I was there they were also accommodating two massive parties and still making room for the rest of us! Five stars hands down! Everything from the front of the house to the back! PIZZA ROCK...YOU GUYS ROCK!!!!",

When we were seated we were told we would have 4 servers to cover all the tables.  My husband and I waited 30 minutes before we received water.  Once some of my guests were finally given menus, they had their drinks and food orders taken (only at one of the tables) a good 30 minutes before others.  We spoke to different servers trying to get our orders taken, didn't work.  Some of the people at the last table, never even got their orders taken, until we had to make a scene, pleading with someone to actually serve us. People were finished eating and leaving, while others were just being served. I was embarrassed and I have never in my life dealt with such rude and unhelpful people.  The service here is the absolute worst! My mother in law order a salad, and was the last to be served!!! Trying to get any help was a joke. NEVER AGAIN!!!",

I always intend to try more of their pizzas, but I can't ever pull myself away from the Cal Italia. It is so delicious! We also always get an order of meatballs. They're super tender and the sauce is great.   The sangria is also pretty freakin' good.   No complaints about their service.

Freemont is a pretty shady place folks. We are talking $15.00 steaks and The Heart Attack Grill. As we took-in the only worthwhile site (The Freemont Experience light-show), we saw a glowing sign slightly in the distance ... Pizza Rock. With a name like that, we were SOLD!  The walk over was filled with phrases like \"Watch your back!\" and \"Keep your wallet in your FRONT pocket!\" but when we arrived, this place was a black oasis in a pretty dumpy area!   The interior is GORGEOUS! Matte black walls with glossy black designs. It is literally walls to ceiling black ... and PHENOMENAL! There are little coves with curtains and chandeliers for parties of two ... super neat!!! Needless to say, the music is ACTUAL rock ... none of this rap/hip-hop dreck that seems to fill all of Vegas. (Again, this place is an OASIS!)  It is immaculate (uber clean!). And, the waitstaff is insanely helpful/cheery/knowledgeable. How really refreshing!   The food was sooo tasty! Our group shared an order of meatballs, garlic bread, a three-cheese calzone, meatball sub, and a margherita pizza ... I highly recommend this so that you get to try a little of everything! And, everything single item was a cheesy, delicious delight!  The prices are on-par with Vegas, but the experience easily exceeded our expectations!  If you visit Freemont, BE CERTAIN TO GO TO PIZZA ROCK! (No doubt, it is the very best place to eat in that area!)",

    "text": "Today is day one of the week long grand opening for Pizza Rock!  So excited to hear another new establishment has moved downtown!  What's even better was I heard they were showcasing their menu for the public and fine tune the overall experience for the actual opening on Saturday.  Originally, we heard you needed reservations to eat there for free this week, however, a coworker mentioned to us that folks working downtown will be able to roll in without reservations and be seated for dinner.  This was a perfect opportunity for a couple of us to have a nice dinner after a hard day's work!  The restaurant is on the corner of Ogden and 3rd St, attached to the Mob Bar and Triple George saloon.  Right away, you notice the huge \"Pizza Rock\" sign from the outside, bordered by flame artwork.  When you enter, there's a nice seating area with a very friendly hostess station.  Everyone was super excited to greet you and take your name.  Because of the grand opening, we were able to walk around the restaurant and take a look at the decor.  To the right of the hostess stand was the Pizza Takeout window with a viewable kitchen.  Pretty cool.  After the seating area, the main focal point of the restaurant is the life sized semi truck in the middle of the dining area.  Super cool!  It serves as a multi purpose art.  Aside from the obvious attention grabber, it's the new DJ station AND serves to break up the bar area and dining area.  WOW! The bar is huge and gorgeous!  Lots of metal art accents around it.  Lots of exposed brick around the restaurant.  They even have little private coves for seating in the dining area if you want to entertain that romantic date or have an intimate family dinner.  Lots going on and it all seems to work.    When we were greeted by our server, Shirley, we were informed of a couple of things:  They didn't have pasta, they didn't have bread, they didn't have sausage and they didn't have steak.  Kind of bummed about it but everything else was free so I couldn't really complain.  Shirley was a bit flustered as I expected on day one.  She quoted the wrong price for wine, ordered our food at different times which resulted in a lot of waiting and found herself making multiple trips to the table, because of the lack of efficiency.  I completely understand.  First day jitters are a given.  She had a GREAT personality and that ended up going a long way in my book.  For dinner, here's what we got:  Classic Caesar, normally for $10.00:  Hearts of Romaine, Homemade Caesar dressing, House Croutons and shaved pieces of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Definitely a shareable dish.  I think this could comfortable feed 3 people as their first course.  Lots of fresh ingredients, but I didn't have a few issues with this salad.  The croutons were way too toasted and very crunchy.  The dressing, as being the star of the dish was way too tangy.  They made it with A LOT of anchovies.  Now I'm a HUGE fan of homemade Caesar dressing but this was way too overpowered with anchovies.  Margherita Pizza, normally for $15.00:  This pizza was a 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner in Italy!  Hand mixed dough using imported flour and proofed in wood boxed imported from Italy.  WOW.  San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt.  The dough from the crust was amazing but the crust turned out a little burnt and had a slightly bitter taste.  The sauce was one of the stars of the show, nice and creamy.  Mozzarella was flavorful and there were a lot for a Margherita, which was awesome.  The only critique was the basil.  Not enough to taste that element which makes a great pie.   Downtown Pizza, normally for $19.00:  WOW, lots going on!  Mozzarella, pepperoni, salami, bacon, chives, mushrooms, read onions, bell peppers, olives, Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes.  Think of it as an upgraded supreme.  With all these ingredients, there was no lack of flavor!  WOW loved the flavor punch.  My only feedback was the crust was too thin for this pizza.  It couldn't support the amount of toppings.  It became soggy real fast and we ended up losing a lot of the toppings on the table.    Manhattan Calzone, normally for $12.00:  Stuffed with meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta and garlic.  As my friend put it, you would pay 12 bucks for cheese and bread.  LOTS of CHEESE.  Omg, it was everywhere.  I personally don't think Ricotta is needed.  Maybe use a lot more meat to balance out the cheese.  Holy cheese!    During this week, all menu food items are free.  Our entire bill was comped which was the best part of the evening.  Please remember to tip your servers great!  This review, I've created, is to give the best and most valuable feedback, so this place thrives downtown.  Just the ambiance alone will take them far.  I will certainly be back to try other items of the menu.  Next time, I'm hitting the steak and pasta hard!",

    "text": "We had dinner at Pizza Rock last weekend while staying across the street at the Downtown Grand.  We had a 15% off coupon from the hotel so we basically had the tip paid for when all was said and done.  Here's what you need to know.  Pizza Rock is NOT Pizza HUT.  You will be seated with a menu and you will have choices of pizzas that have been designed for you already.  They have different types of crusts and are cooked in different types of ovens and some take much longer than others.  It's very important to ask the server to go over the menu with you so you know what you're getting and then you get to figure out something to share.  The ingredients are very fresh and I THINK we chose the American Classic - Downtown 19.  It was really tasty.  The ingredients were piled high on a medium crust and it was just a mouthful of flavors, especially considering we're usually just plain old pepperoni and pineapple.  And we LOVED the pepperoni they have.  YUM.  Also, we had the garlic bread before the pizza came out and I CAN NOT RECOMMEND YOU EAT THIS ENOUGH!   It's so freaking good, might be the best garlic bread ever with WHOLE garlic cloves on it!  In fact, I want that right now... I might have to make some at home tonight.  They have a good selection of beers and some rotating ones as well.  The ambiance is kind of loud, but fun and there are like two little tucked away 2 tops with curtains that are sort of semi-private.  If you think you might want one, ask at the desk before you get seated!  That's where we sat and we liked it and everyone who walked by said, \"oh, I want to sit there\".   There's your tip.  Great, now it will be full when we go back.  Ah well.  Enjoy it.  I know you will.",

    "text": "The pizza is good, but don't come here on Sunday to watch NFL football. We did and barely lived to tell about it...   Visiting Vegas, so a friend searched around for a good place to watch all the NFL games. Pizza Rock told him they'd reserve a table for our group of six at 10am Sunday and the sign on the door trumpets \"Your Football Headquarters\".   The first clue that this wasn't going to go well was when we showed up at 9:45 Sunday morning. The door was locked and the woman inside was signaling \"No\" to us with her hands, indicating that they didn't open till 10am.  Since the games start right at 10am sharp, if you're going to be a sports bar and claim you show all the Sunday games, you should open no later than 9:30. We asked the woman if all the games were going to be shown and she curtly replied, \"Whenever the manager gets to turning them all on.\"  Sure enough, 10am came and several TVs were on the same game and they were missing half of the games that morning.  The two closest TVs  to us were both showing the same game and we asked for the game we most wanted to watch to be shown on one of those TVs. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. We ask again about switching to the game we wanted and we were told that \"Bo, the manager\" had the remote and he was the only one who could change the channel. When it got to 30 minutes and we were still without that game, we started asking for Bo, but he refused to come out. When it got to be 45 minutes and we'd missed the entire first quarter of the game we wanted to see, we started to get really upset and basically said that we were going to go somewhere else to watch the games if we didn't get the TV switched to the game we came to see.  Our server said they were finally going to change the channel, but that Bo (the manager) had said that was the only one he was going to change. Bo of course refused to ever come out and talk to us, even though we asked to talk to him 3 times. He apparently hid in the back the entire time.   At some point, we asked if we could have sound to one of the games turned on instead of the crappy music they were playing. The waitress said a flat out \"No\" telling us that if they turned the sound for our game, somebody else would want sound on their game. At this point, 30 minutes into our stay at Pizza Rock, we were the only people in the place. So basically, we were told that they couldn't accommodate us because some customers who weren't there yet and who might never even show up, might want something else.   In short, this place is poorly run and they don't care about their customers. Looking forward to reading about them closing down in the near future, as you just can't treat customers this poorly and expect to stay in business. There's just no way!",

The atmosphere is very Gothic rock--rock music is constantly being blasted (it can be a little loud) and the lighting is a bit dim, but I like how they committed to an aesthetic, and enjoy the ambiance.   The food is the obvious best part of Pizza Rock. The New Yorker is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten, and I never get tired of ordering it. Due to this, my pizza range has been limited to this one and a few others, but I've had friends try some of the more unique recopies, and have given nothing but rave reviews. Appetizers like the meatballs and calamari are also pretty great.   They also have a phenomenal happy hour, with half-off well drinks and some great beer options. If you enjoy pizza, I think that Pizza Rock is a spot you should definitely check out.",

The Chicago and the Napolitano style are average. Frankly the best Naples style pizza is still Settebello. The tomato sauce is excellent so is the non  pizza items on the menu.

Definitely will be back to this place next time we are in town!",

It was too much for me to finish but both were good. The pizza a little too greasy but the crust was real good. Meatballs were also good. Maybe not the best I've ever had but still good.

The menu is extensive and has quite an offering.  Few of our favorites: the Mob Boss (loaded with meat and veggies), and the New Yorker (love that mozzarella!).  The crust is perfectly made, not too dense so you don't walk away feeling you've eaten a pound of dough.  To lessen the guilt, we usually order the gorgonzola & apple salad. One day we stumbled upon the Rosemary Garlic fries, and wow!  The golden fries were seasoned just right.  We love this place.",

If you want to grab just a slice of pizza, you have to order from the window outside or from the pizza counter inside. Otherwise, you have to order by the pie if you sit at the table.  I had the purple potato pizza and 3 meatballs. The purple potato just tasted like scalloped potatoes, but the pancetta after coming out of that pizza oven...holy... you will slap your mama. So crispy, and the flavor just floods your mouth. I would come back just for this alone. The meat balls were tasty, too.",

    "text": "Before anything else, let me just state that I hate driving to downtown LV because I have no patience to parallel park my yacht, I'm too cheap to pay for parking and there's always some crazy/drunk person crossing the street when they're not supposed to tempting me to run them over.      /endrant  I read on a review to park in DT garage 3 - well, I didn't do that. You can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - I didn't do that either. I parked at Binion's which is a short walk from Pizza Rock. I was told that the DT garage is a mess anyway. I had no clue where I needed to walk after parking my car so I followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. She was walking towards the opposite direction - I was late for dinner but I got pics of her nice cheeks!  /endshenanigans  The place is filled with TV's so you can watch sports. There's a big rig coming out of the wall. Sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. I got a Chimay...3/4 of it since 1/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. They were giving me a grapefruit drink which I apparently ordered and not a Chimay. I hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!  I was looking forward to trying their truffle fries/ rosemary garlic fries and Cal Italia pizza. So we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. Kacey informed us that this is the same as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. She was right. Same menu and everything. We were debating whether or no we should get a Sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? What?  Truffle Fries: Fries were crispy inside and out. Truffle flavor was not noticeable. They drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, I only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. Flavor was definitely lacking. 2/5  Rosemary Garlic Fries: The rosemary taste was strong. I was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of GROSSmary. 2.5/5  Meatballs: 6 tender smelly balls. Smelly because of the cheese probably. They were ok. 3.5/5  Margherita Pizza: Great crisp chewy crust. Real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. A pizza for the purists. 4/5  Cal italia: Mario and Luigi did not approve of the Cal Italia. This California-inspired pizza was a Food Network Gold Medal winner if it matters to anyone. It has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmiggiano-Reggiano and balsamic reduction. Sweet and salty...not for the purists. I enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5/5  We got a 20% discount for being locals. Their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. Service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. Pizzas were good but skip the fries. So, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.  Shortly after posting my review, I got a message from one of the owners and he said:  \"Would like to send you some additional info on Pizza Rock: - Free valet parking is available for Pizza Rock directly across the street at the Downtown Grand casino. - The Sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag.\"  So there! Now you know.",

    "text": "I just to had to come back here with my fam especially after sampling some of their goodies from a CMYE just days before.  So we started with 3 pretty nice sized Meatballs for 6 bucks. Should of got the 6 for 10 deal because the Meatballs were some of the tastiest chunks of beef I have had in a very long time. The marinara sauce that it sits in might as well have been gold because if I wasn't in a public place and was at home, I would have been licking the bowl clean. We also ordered Caesar Salad for 10 bucks. It was pretty good but for that price, I thought we could have gotten more.  After going over the menu, we wanted to try the world famous Margherita Pizza. Here's the actual description from their very own menu: *MARGHERITA 16  (Limit of 73 Made Per Day) World Pizza Cup Winner Naples, Italy  Dough Hand mixed using San Felice Flour, Proofed in Neapolitan Wood Boxes  San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO and Sea Salt  As quickly as we were excited, our server told us the cold hard truth. THERE WAS NO MORE! :(  So much for our excitement. It does say in limited to 73 per day. What a weird number. I think I will ask next time why.  In the mean time, we decided to go simple and ordered a Classic Thin Crust Pepperoni Pizza for 14 bucks. This was cooked in a gas brick oven for 550 degrees. This thin crust features tomato sauce, mozzarella, and pepperoni. Its so simple that its great.  As a side, I wanted to try their wood fired asparagus for 5  bucks. Now this was sheer disappointment. What they give you is like half of what you would get at the supermarket so the portion size was definitely lacking. As for the taste, well lets put it this way, any time you cook vegetables, especially grilling them, you just want to cook it just enough for it to be a little bit crispy still. In this case, it was limp and almost to the point that it was soggy. So yeah, it was overcooked.  Service was on point. We didn't need to ask for anything. Refills were constant and we were constantly checked up on.  The only negatives that stood out for me was the limp Asparagus and the music being played. I loved what they were playing but I thought the volume was a bit loud. I only bring this up because even though my wife sat across from me, after our first conversation after sitting down, we had to repeat just about every other word. As I looked around, it didn't seem like anybody else was being bothered by it so I just left it alone.  Overall, I am definitely coming back here for great Pizza and Meatballs. I just wouldn't recommend ordering the Asparagus and hopefully the music is not as loud next visit.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #23",

    "text": "My most recent visit was on Tuesday night with a group of 24. The food is great, I had the baked calzone. I understand large groups can be challenging especially with separate checks. The food came out at all different times with some not getting their food until others were already finished.  When the checks arrived on clipboards, we each paid our tab accordingly but there was still a mix up. Myself and a co worker were waiting for our receipt and change after our entire party had already paid and received receipts. After multiple attempts with getting my receipt and change, somehow my coworker paid my bill and I received her change, since it was too much money I was getting back, I knew it wasn't mine and reminded them of my name and order two more times and they had to research what happened, which took another ten minutes. When they figure out what happened, they asked my coworker for the money they gave her back and told them she paid the wrong bill and she owed more money since my bill was less and they needed to now close my bill and hers. We had to wait for a manager that never apologized for the mix up or offer to comp our meal or offer a future meal, as we have now waited 20 minutes or more after our party left.   I'm a local and I am a fan of the food as I have been here several times, but I don't think this would be a place I would frequent with a large group. I know people have an off night but it was a huge inconvenience.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock is a popular favorite for both tourists and locals alike. I have to give credit where it is due and compliment the owner and staff for truly defining what a modern upscale pizza place is \"supposed\" to look like. It has all the attributes that make it modern cool, like whimsical chalk art, faux semi truck visual display, take out counter, full bar decorated with masculine biker style adornments, a full menu with unique toppings like clams (in the shell) and others. It caters to Yelpers by offering discounts and Check-in offers. It's menu is eclectic and fun. The table has a large white butcher paper covering with crayons provided for drawing and tic tac toe like Macaroni Grill. The sign is neon and ultra hip and cool. The only major issue I have with the place is that it simply tries too hard.   This is a place that I have dined at 3 times and left every time thinking it was pretty good but also pretty overrated. The pizzas are good. The portions are large but the flavors don't really knock me out of the park.   I would like to see all the pizzas available in a personal size version. Many of the unique creations are only available in one size. The prices are pretty hefty for a pizza place but it is also expected due to the \"hip & cool\" overall theme that it represents.   Overall, I do like Pizza Rock. Though I feel it is a tad overrated, it isn't anywhere near as overrated as some other popular places in town (like Hash House a Gogo, for example). It is really a place that you go to because you want to enjoy some better than average food in an awesome cool atmosphere.",

I paid $6 for a slice to pick up from the \"take-out\" window but it was monstrous. Had to bring it back to the bar which may be weird & inconvenient to most, but I was in a good mood this night so no complaints. What I will give 5 stars to is Dan the Man @ the take-out bar, he was super friendly and very informative! I got vegetarian and it was pretty good... for vegetarian. And for people who like pizza. I was expecting life-changing flavor, but none of that (hence the 4 stars). Sorry, can't speak for any meat slices out there but my friend enjoyed his!   What I also WILL give 5 STARS to is having one of my all-time favorite beers on tap: Blanche de Bruxelles. I'm pretty sure that's hard to come by in America. So KUDOS!! Also did enjoy the loud music and continuous music video play on the TV screens. Many may not, may make it hard to have a conversation.",

They were non stop on the move but still made time for the patrons and myself.  I got the purple potato and the veggie slices.  Socks are blown off.  The slices are ginormous and very delicious. I also love the music of this place.  I had come to terms with being considered a woman who is getting old(especially with my taste in music )and pizza rock understands me lol.  I will definitely come back.  Keep up the good work guys",

We ordered slices from the front and decided to stay and have a drink at the bar. The pizza was light and delicious. Small crunchy pepperonis and perfectly crunchy crust with a tasty rind! I had to get another on the way out and got the slice of the day which had tasty ricotta cheese and prosciutto ham. On top of the great pizza was the great bar service. My wife ordered the best mojito I've ever tasted and I had a simple gin and tonic which was perfectly mixed in a classy crystal glass. Sunday we brought the kids back with us and got a few more slices before we left town!!!",

Glad we did. When walking in, the loud music piped in and around the entrance did give it that touristy feel but once you get inside, you could be anywhere in the suburbs. Downtown or not, it's very nice place...and much larger than I'd imagined. I thought it was just a place to grab a slice and go but it's got a nice menu of various pizza options, very nicely decorated inside, clean, comfortable and large! We had no issues with staff during our visit. Pizza was excellent. We had the 12 inch American classic cheese and that was enough for 2 people easy. Salad was fresh, not your basic iceberg lettuce either, but spinach and other greens.",

The Margherita pizza was really good too, and we tried a new pizza the chef created that had Guinness in the pizza dough that was like whoa! Very tasty! Washed it all down with a couple of Arrogant Bastards and we were all set! It was my first trip there and will definitely be back.

I understand if you are busy at the time you aren't able to. But when you have one on the phone and the other one just standing there and you dont tell your guest we will be with you in a min and we stand staring at each other without a word for a couple of min makes it a bit awkward. A smile goes a long way and when you look like you dont want to be there that doesnt reflect well on your establishment. With that being said the food was delicious.  We got the garlic breadsticks great portion for 2 people. The Gino pizza was so yummy thin slices of pineapple with so much cheese, I mean who doesn't love alot of cheese on their pizza???",

Instead make me walk inside and come to find out only offer cheese and pepperoni pizza by the slice. So what you're telling me is not only did I have to walk inside but you aren't offering the whole pizza by the slice menu? Lastly, why in the hell would you stack hot pizza slices on top of one another? Oh yeah to have them melt together so I can't eat the whole slice of pizza(see attached).  If you plan on going to this pizza joint, plan  accordingly and sit inside and enjoy your pizza rather than have it melted onto a paper plate.  I hope this review helps those seeking pizza by the slice to take their business somewhere else where the business puts the customers wants/needs/appetite first",

I can't attest to the pizza since I am keto, so I have had their meatballs (which I know has carbs but it fit my macros) and their italian chop salad as well as their burratta burger.  I enjoyed my buratta burger lettuce wrapped, and i forgot to say no fries but they were REALLY tasty fries!  In fact, one of the tastiest fries I've ever had.  I HAD to sneak in a few to satisfy myself.  The meatballs were good, but are they as good as my grandma's or my mothers (my \"grandma\" was Italian, and my mom learned her ex MIL's authentic italian cooking)  heck no, but they're still good, and big!   I wouldn't come out of the way to come here but if you're in DTLV and need a place to eat, then this is a good spot.  I would avoid the italian chop salad, you can make it yourself at home. Nothing special, but everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal that they had.",

There were 6 of us, and we ended up bringing about a pie's worth of pizza back to the hotel.  I'd definitely recommend the New Yorker and the Detroit Red Top. They were delicious in their own ways, and both I'd happily order again!  As excited as I was about the Margherita (admittedly I was pulled in by the exclusivity a bit... they only make 73 a day), it was meh. It was a pretty plain pizza (which Margherita is), but I found it bland. I wouldn't get it again.  While we were happy about the food, we found the service pretty poor. We were seated centrally in the restaurant, but still had trouble getting anyone's attention. It's a decently sized restaurant, and maybe they just don't have enough waiters, but don't expect very good service.",

Thanks to Tony Hsieh (CEO of Zappos), there has been a big revitalization and it's a refreshing change to get off the strip.  After meetings and site visits, we were starving! Pizza Rock looked like a decent option, so we made our way inside. The hostess was awesome and led us to our table (loved her nose piercing).   We ordered The New Yorker. Fun Fact: It won 'Best Traditional Pizza in the World' at the Las Vegas Pizza Expo.   DELISH. We tore that shizz up! Not a slice left between the three of us. The flavors balanced perfectly - LOVED the sauce and the sausage didn't have too much fennel. The ricotta was the perfect amount.  My only complaint is the server didn't stop by once to ask if we wanted drink refills. Other than that, a rockin' experience. No pun intended.  Will definitely return next time I'm in town.",

Started off with some appetizers -Calamari, spicy and original, fried to perfection with a spicy aioli and marinara sauce. One of my favorite things from dinner, loved how spicy the calamari and aioli was. Yummmmm -Fried artichoke, never been a huge fan of artichokes but not bad.  -Meatballs, not a huge fan of ground beef either, but I devour these in one bite.    Now moving on to the main attraction aka love of my life...pizza. -New Yorker, oh em gee this was amazing! So cheesy and the pepperoni with sausage was a wonderful pairing. The ricotta cheese was a game changer.  -Margherita pizza, yes please with extra basil.  Dessert -Mud Pie, perfect amount of sweetness and chocolate with a drizzle of caramel.    Loved the trucker truck inside the main dining room and loved the sanitary foot door handle in the restroom. I am such a germaphobe, little things like this make me so happy.

    "text": "So my friend and I decided to check out Pizza Rock located on 3rd street let me tell you my experience..  Well this place rocks! (Pun not intended) lol Huge outside sign you can't miss it! Pizza Rock is on a corner of a small yet beautiful street , the face lift of downtown is amazing so far. Parking is quite hard to find and it's paid parking I think it's like 2 dollars for 2 hours but it's downtown it's like that everywhere over here. Well let's go inside shall we ?   So I've been reading the past reviews about their hostess being super unfriendly well I guess the management corrected that real quick. We were quickly greeted with big smiles and were sat almost immediately. Good job guys . The inside surprisingly gets bigger the more you walk in .Beautiful  rock and roll theme with a modern flair and of course with the music to match! The servers were nice,drinks came out fast, and staff was knowledgeable about the menu . The menu is a little hard to read, way to dark and since there's a lot of items it can get confusing . Well Let's eat shall we!   I came in during happy hour . So I ordered a personal pizza for 7 dollars called tony 2 times basically a meat lovers pizza . It was delicious nice char on the bottom of the pizza super good crust and the cheese stretch sealed the deal for me . My friend ordered the pesto paradise which is a thin crust pizza I didn't get to try it but she finished her pizza before me so I'm guessing it was good ? Lol  My daughter got a personal pizza and since it was only one topping it was 5 dollars that stretchy cheese made it fun for her to eat . Last we got the garlic and rosemary fries which were soo good especially at the bottom where all the garlic and rosemary is at sooo good ! Kinda wish they had a ketchup bottle for the tables however .   This place is super trendy, kid friendly with a kids menu . Good music and equipped with a nice bar for adult drinks . A cool place to take pictures and just hangout . I most definitely recommend this restaurant GO GO GO !!",

Downtown was unique, we thought the full sized truck in the dining section was cool, and they offered a small takeout section.  The GVR was a standard hotel set-up.  Basically wait in line, or make reservations.     We had the Mob Boss pizza.   It had way too much dough, topping were sparse, actually the toppings that were on the pizza kept falling off, sauce was sparse.  This pizza just didn't make any sense.  Take it off the menu please.    The classic meat balls smoothed in marinara sauce saved the day.   At $6 for 3 we really enjoyed it.  We actually used the pizza dough from the Mob Boss to soak-up the sauce.  .  The Italian chop salad for $14 was good, but I think it's over priced.   The Cocktail menu was ok.   We did like the beer menu.  The mixed cocktails we ok.",

We got the salumi and formaggio plate, which came with three cured meats that were all pretty similar but the bleu cheese, fig spread, and walnuts were exactly what I wanted. The calamari was alright; it's a large portion and you have the option of doing half spicy, half original. The accompanying marinara is BOMB.  But let's talk about the pizza!! We opted for the award-winning Margherita. The crust was chewy and had a nice texture and toasty flavor from the charred blisters - fantastic. It tasted homemade in the best way. Worth ordering, especially because most American pizza consists of a thick, bready crust built to hold the onslaught of toppings we tend to like. Pizza Rock takes you back to basics and that's a good thing.",

The Detroit style is my personal favorite even though I'm FROM Michigan and was previously unaware that Detroit had a pizza style . It is a little on the speedy side but the ingredients are fresh and it seems like they put a lot of thought into the pizzas so I think it's worth it. I haven't tried any non-pizza items tbh, but I suspect they'd be fine. This location is great, I live pretty close so I can order a pizza to go and swing by easily; to them eat in silence and peace at home as is my want these days.",

I have so many options here in Vegas, I come to enjoy the entire experience. My group each started with a salad , I opted for the fried artichoke ( pretty good choice) came out hot, fresh but thrown in front of me and told \"hot, don't burn your face!\" Ok I have a pretty good sense of humor. But then we needed utensils, it's just difficult to eat salads without forks, right? We got 3- but there's 4 of us. Took a hot minute to get another setup. Out came the pizza, we ordered a very simple 1/2cheese 1/2 pepperoni. Although it was a decent pizza ( I used to make pizzas for a living back in the day) it was unbelievably greasy. So needless to say I will not be back here. It's a trendy joint, flashy come inside signs, but not worth the blah attitude and just ok food.",

It was ready when we got there and we decided to eat in. The sauce was really very, very nice! I ordered a full pie for 2 people thinking it would save money. It did not. I'm hind sight I would have ordered single slices (bless them for doing this) so I could have tried different pizzas, especially the New York style. Instead we had enough for a late snack and breakfast the next day. I'll just have to come back, Pizza Rock. Though I have to be prepared myself for the sticker shock of the pizza. Yikes!",

    "text": "Pizza and beer at baseline is a great combo but this place makes great pizza topped off with a good beer selection.  They have everything from a simple Margherita to New York Style pizza.  I usually prefer thin to NY style pizza but I went Sicilian because they won some award for it.  I wasn't disappointed and was able to split one pizza among 3 people with leftovers.  The pizza was around 30 dollars but good quality and quantity make the price reasonable.  The staff was friendly.  The wait for a table on Saturday night was about 20 minutes so we sat at the bar.  Some mild things to consider is this place has poor lighting and is very loud.  A lot of my friends recommended this place to me stating it is the best place for pizza in Vegas.  So far, I agree with them.  I gave this place 4 stars because the pizza I had in Italy is 5 stars (So pretty darn good!).  Conclusion:  sober up with a good quality slice of pizza.",

When you first walk in they have a section you can walk up to and order pizza or whatever they have there from the front or you can ask to sit down.  The place itself is very nice and really feels like a place built to feel like a rock house  The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the menu. The menu is made out of old record holders and the happy hour/specials are on the record itself they give you (printer on). It's a really cool concept but the menu seems so cluttered and unorganized. Change the design and that will help  We got a pepperoni and ground beef pizza (see pictures) it was worth the money for it (we paid 26 after our drinks and stuff I think it was like 18 for the 12\" American original pizza)  The Sauce was actually good and the fresh bake of the pizza in the wood oven really brings out the flavor.  The waiter was friendly and it was just awsome!",

I can't imagine it's meant to be this way & it was also really charred, overwhelming the wettest pizza as a whole. My man said to me that my search has to stop because he can't handle anymore let downs.   We also had the meatballs & garlic bread which were excellent. Decided on tiramisu as well to get the pizza taste out of our mouths.   The place itself is a lot of fun with so much personality. It's also very dark which I always love. It had so many manly features like a semi truck! Fun! But it also thought of the ladies with chandeliers & a super cute restroom (I love it when places don't forget about the restrooms). The service was great & the atmosphere was awesome but I still can't get over our soggy pizza. After all this place is called Pizza Rock & our pizza didn't rock at all.",

CALAMARI FRITTI* 13 Traditional or Calabrese Style with  Calabrese Aioli and Marinara Dipping Sauces  Great dipping sauces and good calamari. Pricey for an appetizer.   BEER BATTERED FRIED ARTICHOKES 8.5 With Calabrese Aioli  Hmm wish it had more than 2 pieces, this was delicious!  NEW YORKER 23 Winner, Best Traditional in the World, Vegas Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage,  Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta  The ricotta was not how I usually see ricotta on a pizza. This was whipped and light and I can't say I was a huge fan of it, but as you can see I still give the place 4 stars. If the ricotta was not whipped and so soft, I would have liked it thicker if that makes sense. It would have been absolute perfection of a pizza!   The pepperoni was top notch, and this is coming from someone who hates pepperoni. I never get pepperoni on pizza. It was small, crispy, and tasty. Although a bit greasy, nowhere near what I think of when I think of pepperoni. I am just glad I tried what real pepperoni should be and now I can't say I hate pepperoni. Sausage, I would never ever choose sausage on a pizza but I was with my friend and hubby and majority rules. Well, this sausage was really good. I rarely ever say that about sausage or any meat on my pizza. The combinations of flavors on this pizza was perfect. The toppings were spread out perfectly getting a bite of almost everything in each bite. The dough was perfect and cooked to perfection, also tasted good and I ate the crust. This pizza dough was exactly the pizza I like.   The service was very good for being as crowded as they were. I was actually surprised by the good service we got with that many people in the restaurant.  Our waiter was so friendly and came around just the right amount of times. I did not need to hunt him down for more water, and he did not come often enough that it was annoying.   I was expecting rock music since they are called Pizza Rock, but I did not hear rock music. I heard music that reminded me of skating at the skating rink in junior high. I enjoyed it, but it was really really really loud. I could not hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me.   One of their downfalls for me is their location. It works for them though and I am sure brings the great business. I am just being selfish and prefer to go to restaurants not on the strip or not in downtown.  The wait was a one hour wait (I hate waiting for food) and they were extremely packed! I saw bachelorette parties, wedding parties, large parties, and all kinds of interesting people (people who looked dressed up for a marathon, literally ran the marathon then came in for pizza? love that). It was a tourist crowd for sure. Parking is a bit of pain coming from someone who got spoiled by Vegas' easy parking. But, it won't stop me from coming, it just is more of a \"hassle\" being in downtown area near Fremont. I wish they would open one in downtown Summerlin *hint hint*.   All of their pizzas look amazing and I can't wait to try the prosciutto and pear, clam and garlic (brings back childhood memories of clam pizza on Venice beach-I have not had clam pizza since and would love to try theirs), cal italia, and more.   -1 star only because music was too loud, waits are long, ricotta was weird to me, and a bit pricey. It won't stop me from coming back because I really enjoyed the majority of everything in this restaurant, specifically the pizza.   I did get a yelp check in offer and was very happy about that!!",

The music was loud. Trying to have a conversation it was a little bit of a challenge.   We ordered the White Wine Clams for appetizers. It was so good! The garlicky sauce was perfect for dipping with their complimentary bread. We opted to get the classic Margherita Pizza. This too was excellent. The crust was perfectly charred which added to the great flavor of the pizza.   I think this is one of the best go-to places in Downtown. It is worth the drive just to go try this place.",

I had the Pizza Rock Meatballs (definitely enough for 2 or 3 to split) and the Molinari personal size pizza - both were pretty good.  As far as Vegas visits go, if I were in the Fremont area craving pizza, I'd go here, but it's not the sort of place I'd make a special trip to Fremont JUST to eat here.  Does that make sense?",

Would've given it 5 stars if it weren't for the girl that sat us down. She decided to sit us by the bar in the back right next to a loud speaker. That's cool and all if I wasn't there with my wife and my 6 month old at the time. Come on lady common sense would be sit us at the front where it's not super loud and hard to get to with a stroller. But I suppose they didn'twant a family at the front but rather the \"cool\" people. Whatever.",

We broke vegetarian protocol and added a Chicago fennel sausage (yep!) . One word. EXCELLENT  . We complimented our pizza wIth a local brew 'downtown brown ', Ashley told us about a very special cocktail that is her favorite. We thought we should be polite and have them for desert.:)  A Spicy Pomegranate Margarita.  over the top!! Oh yeah vegas baby.  Grounded Lavender sea salt rim, with orange & pomagranite liqueurs, home made sweet n sour freshest squeezed fruit with a Serrano infused Tequila . Oh yes ! Huge glass for $9.50 way worth it!

The sauce makes my mouth water just thinking about it.    For an appetizer please please try the spicy honey sausage thing they have on the menu!  It literally is the most delicious thing!  Since we drive to Vegas we stop here and get sausage to go and put it in the ice chest.  Problem is, it doesn't last when we get home.  It's amazing!    We also have had the Caesar salad and split the small one to add greens!  It's very tasting dressing!   I am positive there are more amazing things on this menu!  Maybe sometime we will venture out and try more but what we get is so tasty that we cannot stray because we are not in Vegas enough to do so!  Go try pizza rock!  You will NOT be disappointed!   About to leave Vegas now and we are stopping to get a to go order with us!",

I think it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  The drinks from the bar were good.  It was a nice way to celebrate arriving into town.  They need a location on the Strip.",

I have been here many times with friends, family, and late night cravings.I have not been disappointed in any of my visits. I enjoy that you can buy a single slice, but the pure joy is in getting a full pie. The location has a great and spacious layout with a cargo truck near the bar. Regardless of time that I have shown up, the staff has been great! I have enjoyed many items from this menu: new yorker, parmgianno regianno, the mob boss, marinara, meatballs (favorite item to start with), caesar salad, green beans. Along with the service, I have been disappointed in my food. As far as the style, to each there own. I feel each pie attracts different people, and I like my pizza to have a slight crisp to the crust, and can fold in half holding all the toppings. I'm a fan, and a regular so much that I went to the green valley location. I still like the downtown because it's close to me and other places I like.",

    "text": "Their pizza is OUT OF THIS WORLD. That's all you need to know.  My first visit was during Yelp Helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). That night, I tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. Everything was so good that I returned just four days later with my fiance and friend Hally!  During my return visit, I had to order the Margherita ($16) again. The dough is hand-mixed with San Felice flour and proofed in Neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO, and sea salt. Finally, it's baked in a 900-degree Wood Stefano Ferrara oven. It's limited to 73 pies daily (although I heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy. True Neopolitan pizza!   The three of us also shared the Downtown ($19): Pepperoni, Molinari Salami, Bacon, Chives, Mushrooms, Red Onions, Bell Peppers, Black Olives, Italian Sausage, Cherry Tomatoes; which is one of their \"American Originals\" pizzas that all feature tomato sauce, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. As well as the Honey Pie ($17): Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers; one of their \"California\" pizzas that use Caputo Flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven.   The Downtown reminded me of a \"supreme/deluxe\" pizza, but definitely better. I had tried the Honey Pie during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, I came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. I also tried their Classic Caesar salad ($10) and it was tasty. For drinks, I tried the Strawberry Fields Martini ($9.50): Stoli Strawberry, Strawberry Puree and a Hint of Mint and Hally ordered the Moscow Mule ($12): Stoli Vodka, Ginger Beer, and Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice. Both really delicious cocktails.   From both visits, my favorite pizzas are the Margherita, Honey Pie, and New Yorker and I absolutely loved the Sweet Nothing cocktail, so good. I didn't care for the Calamari Fritti, Rosemary Garlic Fries, or the Mastunicola pizza. Anyway, I could eat that Margherita pizza every day. It's that good. I have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so I can try their other delicious concoctions (I have my eyes on the PIzza Campari, Clam and Garlic, and Proscuitto e Pomodorini). Hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry Grimaldi's). But seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?  Parking is best on the surrounding streets like on Casino Center Blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at The Downtown Grand (super easy and close). Oh, and don't forget your locals discount!! WIN.",

    "text": "The western U.S. wrote the book on terrible pizza, but Pizza Rock is an exception to that rule. The overall dining experience here is 5 stars - especially in comparison to other Las Vegas \"pizza\" locations. But there are a few issues keeping this place from truly rocking it, as it were.  Most importantly, Pizza Rock's menu needs serious help. Someone at this restaurant needs to understand the menu, as presented, is way out of bounds when it comes to pizza menus. With pretty much any real pizza joint, you typically have your crust options followed by your topping options, and a few \"specialty\" pies, and that's it. Short, sweet, simple.  Pizza Rock, in an effort to break the mold (which I always encourage) prints a large and very clunky menu that takes forEVER to read. Although it is loosely broken down by pizza styles, each pizza (and there are MANY) has its own custom toppings. Between the styles, names, awards, and ingredients, it is a daunting read. It's like hey you can get this Italian pizza with 12 cheeses, a half pineapple and five rabbits' feet or this next pizza that won the South Central Tracey Bonham award in 1998 and it comes with four butchered gnomes and an upside-down piano on it.   The point is, ASK THE SERVER. I was so sick of reading I just requested whatever Pizza Rock's version of a large New York style pizza where it goes crust, tomato sauce, then cheese. And, wouldn't you know it, the pizza tasted great!  The other issue is the restrooms. Terrible! No water pressure, no paper towels, AND you had to pull the door inward to leave (which means touching the handle everyone else who didn't not have water or paper towels just touched, and dreading picking up your next slice of pizza.  Pizza places MUST have clean bathrooms. The fact that so many reviewers don't seem to mind really gives you an idea of Yelp's demographic.",

    "text": "Woah Yeah!!! Excellent dining experience. We were a large group of eight. We were sat quickly and the restaurant is very accommodating for large groups. Service was also prompt and polite. After a day at the pool we were starving, food was out within ten minutes. The pizza here comes out hot and scrumptious. I couldn't stop talking about the crisp doughy delight in each bite of my slice. I'm pretty certain it was so good it could be deemed as \"orgasmic.\" Ordered the rosemary French fries that were also incredible. The decor and ambiance is very welcoming, edgy and not so noisy that you can't hold a conversation. I would definitely recommend this pizza spot right off of Fremont St. They also do delivery and pick up orders.",

My kids loved loved loved the spaghetti and meatballs. The lasagna was amazing, the meat sauce was so tasty and there was so much sausage in my lasagna - I was in heaven. Took the left overs to the hotel and ate them late that night - cold - yet it was still good.  So good we ordered pizza and spaghetti for dinner the next night and their delivery service was excellent and fast.",

I immediately noticed all the trash on the floor but decided to overlook the cleanliness issue until I saw a huge COCKROACH crawling on the wall next to our table.  I was so disgusted so I immediately notified the hostesses and their response was appalling.  They made no attempt to deal with this crawling disgusting bug.  I had to make a big deal about it and finally the guys sitting at the table next to ours killed the bug.  By that time my appetite was nonexistent!   The manager finally came over and apologized and offered a free dessert which we did not want so they discounted the bill. After all of the drama, the pizza was very mediocre.   I will never return to this filthy establishment.  I don't even want to think about how dirty the kitchen is if they have cockroaches crawling and ignorant hostesses that are absolutely clueless.   Try Grimaldi's if you are looking for good pizza in Vegas.  It's mouthwatering good!!  Marianne San Diego",

    "text": "I kept hearing about this Tony guy and his award winning pizzas, I was excited to try a new pizzeria that was getting so much buzz.   Goal was to try one pizza from each of the ovens.  NAPOLETANA - 900 DEGREE WOOD STEFANO FERRARA. We went with the MARGHERITA. This was pretty standard, nothing stood out, I felt it was served a bit cold as well, although Michael made a good point, it couldn't been from the photo ops.  PIZZA ROMANA - ELECTRIC BRICK OVEN 700 DEGREES. We chose the ROMANA III. It's 3 pizzas in 1. 1/3 was Gorgonzola, Dates & Pecans, Apples, Honey, Nutella (this was my favorite) 1/3 was Sweet Fig Preserves, Prosciutto, Gorgonzola, Balsamic Reduction (this was my second favorite) and the other portion was Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa, Piquante Peppers. This was a nice option if you have lots of people in your party, you can a piece of each.  CLASSIC ITALIAN - GAS BRICK OVEN 650 DEGREES. We chose the CAL ITALIA. This was the Gold Medal winner on the Food Network, and the winner for Jaime W and I. I liked how all the ingredients came together.  CALIFORNIA - 900 DEGREE WOOD FIRE OVEN. We chose the QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE. This had a kick, spicy! This was my least favorite of the pizzas, not a fan of eggs on my pizza, but at least I can say I gave it a try.   We then sampled the Farmers Market pizza, weekly special using ingredients from Downtown Farmers Market, this week it was pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, bacon and topped with dollops of marshmallow. Didn't really do anything for me.   Dessert, yes we still had room for dessert. Mud Pie, Pecan Turnover and Desert Calzone. Nothing really excited me. It was all pretty standard.   Overall, I wasn't in love with this place. Nothing was that spectacular that would make me drive to Downtown and attempt to find parking. Save this place for the tourists.",

I asked to see a menu and was given a dirty one, I handed it back to her and asked for a clean one. She looked at me as if she had something to say then said alright let me look. The second menu she handed me was satisfactory.  After sitting down it took about 15 min for our waitress to come over. As soon as she comes over I ordered the Gorgonzola apple salad, and the honey pie. The salad was very mediocre; the pizza was tasty but had a few flaws. The main flaw being the fried onion strings on top of the pizza. They were unnecessary, made the pizza greasier, and took away from the other great ingredients. Fried onions have no place on a pizza!",

Pizza wise, the dough was great, sauce flavorful, and toppings high quality. To tag along with a great beer menu, the atmosphere in general is very good.

    "text": "This post is overdue, but then again, when am I not behind? A couple weeks ago, we went downtown to try Pizza Rock. It's owned by Tony Gemignani you might know him from Bar Rescue. We also know of him because of his restaurant is San Francisco, Tonys Pizza Napoletana. Upon returning from our recent trip, I checked to see how the menus compare... they're practically identical. That meant those delicious meatballs could be had right here at home. We only hoped they were just as good.   My brother joined us and we got there in time for happy hour (Mon-Fri 3-6; Sun-Thur 10-close). Beers, appetizers and pizzas are discounted (local's discount does not apply). They have a great craft beer selection ($5) so they hooked me on that alone. We each ordered meatballs ($3). The meatball itself was just as good as those in San Francisco, but the sauce was too acidic. Hopefully, the kitchen is still tweaking the recipe. Still, we enjoyed them. We shared an order of garlic bread ($5). Very garlicky, but otherwise unmemorable.   We each ordered a personal pizza from the happy hour menu. This was a great savings and a way to try pizzas we typically wouldn't order. Frank's True Italian ($7) had pesto garlic and it was topped with mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. This was our favorite of the three.    The pepperoni had some kick ($5) but it was the least liked crust and Cal Italia ($7) was too sweet for my liking; it seemed like dessert. However, it came highly recommended from our server and it has won awards. It has sweet fig preserve and topped with mozzarella, gorgonzola, and prosciutto.   Pizzas I've had at Tony's have been far more impressive so next time I'll stick to the regular menu for pizza, but I'll definitely enjoy those $3 meatballs and $5 craft beers again.",

Here in Vegas again, two months later and decided to go to their location. Good music and got sat right away. Disappointed that the server wasn't too helpful with explaining the beers they had on draft and when we got our drinks they were not cold. Don't know about you, but warm beer sucks especially when it was warm inside the building and needless to say we made very poor choices on our drinks. We couldn't drink them they tasted so bad (probably because they were warm). Got our papa Gino pizza pretty fast, but took forever for our waitress to come over so I could get ranch, which is 50 cents extra. Overall, pizza was good, but service could have been better.",

    "text": "Pizza OVERLOAD!  So many different pies...different ovens...different toppings...no time for all that!  Came with a group of Yelpers with big appetites, so we were able to BLAST our way through quite a bit on the menu!  My FAVORITE by far was the Cal-Italia ($18): Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano & Balsamic Reduction. This was EXCELLENT and the highlight of the meal for me! Great mix of sweet, savory and vinegar/acidic flavors.  Highly recommended :)  Another great choice would be the Margherita ($16): San Marzano Tomatoes, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO and Sea Salt. Honestly, this was probably the FIRST enjoyable Margheria I've had! Not usually a fan of this style pie.  Whatever they do differently here, I enjoyed...but you may not for the same reasons.  Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale ($18): Mozzarella, White Rose Potatoes, Chorizo, Pork Cheek, Rosemary, Fromage Blanc, Calabrese Peppers & Lavender Sea Salt. This was surprisingly SPICY...a bit over the top, but still enjoyable.  Order it knowing it's actually spicy, and you'll do just fine.  Romana III ($32): 1) Sweet Fig Preserves, Prosciutto, Gorgonzola & Balsamic Reduction. 2) Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa & Piquante Peppers. 3) Gorgonzola, Dates & Pecans, and Apples, Honey, Nutella. Interesting combinations here...the only one that didn't really satisfy was the middle portion. A bit SPENDY, but it's huge and serves 2-4 people.  I'd pass on this one next visit.  For dessert, we also tried quite a bit.  The best IMO was the Pecan Turnover : Light Puff Pastry, Maple Pecan, Crunch & Coffee Ice Cream. This was pretty tasty...probably the most enjoyable dessert we tried. Came out piping hot too...yum :)  Apple Calzone : Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Caramel & Vanilla Gelato. This is served with 2 calzones...pretty GOOD overall but nothing extraordinary.   Market Pizza : Pumpkin Puree, Cinnamon, Brown Sugar, Bacon & Marshmallows. Not really my kind of dessert...perhaps if you are a PUMPKIN lover?  Mud Pie : Oreo Cookie Crust, Chocolate Ganache, Coffee Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, Caramel & House Made Whipped Cream. This was very FROZEN...hard as a rock. I enjoyed the cookie crust though.   So it's a hit or miss kinda spot for me.  Depending on what you order, your results WILL vary...for better and worse.

We got both the traditional and spicy (Yum). The gorganzola fries were surprisingly good and i don't even like gorganzola. (Though i did try a piece alone and it wasn't the best idea but thats just my taste buds. Even if you don't like gorganzola, its still a great \"antipasta\") we give the pizza a 4.5. A little more cheese and it would have been perfect. The coconut cooler was great, my brother actually ended up taking that from me lol. Our server i think Daniel was his name, did a GREAT job with food and drink suggestions. Made his rounds to make sure everything was good with our table and wasn't over baring.  Overall it's been a great experience and we'll be back.",

Not quite sure where the best place to park is for free parking. I ended up going to the Binion's garage (free 3 hour parking with validation). It's just a short walk away (1 block).  A Sunday brunch stroll in was welcoming. Not too busy, friendly staff. We decided to start off with the Salumi & Formaggio Board and a Margherita pizza, which apparently is a signature pizza they're proud of. Ended the meal with a tiramisu dessert.  Salumi & Formaggio Board: Assorted meats and cheeses, candied walnuts, focaccia toast and fig jam. I enjoyed this. One of the lighter options to start off your meal.  Margherita pizza: The pizza was quite tasty. You can tell they used some great ingredients in this. Split between 2 people, this pizza satisfied us, but it's not a heavy pizza. The ravenous might want to go for one of the heftier pizza options.  Tiramisu: Really tasty and creamy, served in a glass. Not a huge dessert, but makes for a good closing.   All in all, a great experience here. One thing I noticed on the way out is that they have weekly specials that use ingredients purchased at the Downtown 3rd Farmers Market. I'm going to have to give those a try on my next go around. There are also huge TVs located at every corner which made it great for us to watch the football game during our meal.",

Since I was staying nearby on a business trip I decided to give Pizza Rock a try after seeing lots of good reviews. Unfortunately for a single person their pizzas were too large and I wasn't able to take any back with me. Instead I ordered a house salad and meat and cheese board. The salad was a salad, nothing special to report. I've ordered lots of charcuterie and cheese boards before and let me tell you the portions of prosciutto, cheeses, and salami were huge! Not to mention there were two massive pieces of bread. It was safe to say I barely put a dent in it.   The bartender was super nice and let me know they do personal pizza for happy hour M-F 3-6 & 10-12 (I wish I would have known sooner). I'd love to come back and try a pie because they look amazing. Next time...",

They had everything from Pizza Port in California to Brooklyn in NYC.    While the beer and pizza may be great, the service was not. Our waiter was very much in a rush , and after ordering a pizza, we realized that there was a late -night happy hour menu that he never told us about. I went to cancel the order about two seconds later and the waiter got incredibly agitated. He gave us such an attitude that another waitress came over and helped us out.   We ordered two pizzas from this menu and both were so good.  If it not been for the service issue, Pizza Rock would have been an easy five stars. Plus, the craft beer list is the best I came across in Vegas.",

We came inside and were instantly hit with the smell of delicious pizza and music playing the background (which can be too loud for people with sensitive ears). Very fun atmosphere. In the front you could order pizza by the slice on the right, or get seated in the big seating area to the left.  We were immediately seated! Our waiter was very attentive. After reading that there were 2 award winning pizzas, we had to try them out!  Margherita pizza ($17) - 5/5: This was the World Pizza Cup Winner in Naples, Italy and only 73 are made in one day. We were lucky enough to get one, and it was so delicious! The crust was baked just right and the toppings were not overbearing and blended perfectly well with each other.  Cal Italia ($19) - 5/5: This is the winner of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge and I wouldn't doubt it! It has Asiago, mozzarella, imported Gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic reduction. It was quite possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted. It was sweet, but had a great tang to it. I'm salivating as I'm writing this review! It's definitely a must try when coming here.  If you're in DTLV, you HAVE to come here. This has the title of the Best of Las Vegas for a reason!",

I tried the Napoletana Margherita (they only make 73 a day), and the Classic Pepperoni. Both pizzas were great, and the crust was fantastic!  They have a \"pizza by the slice\" counter at the front of the restaurant, but if you have time I strongly recommend being seated and ordering a fresh pizza.  Like all \"PBTS\", it's reheated and never tastes nearly as good as a fresh one.   Bonus:  They have 3 locations: Downton Las Vegas (Downtown Grand), Henderson (Green Valley Ranch) and Sacramento CA.",

    "text": "I came to Pizza Rock on a Sunday with 2 friends for brunch. Unfortunately, our experience there was disappointing.  The restaurant is located in downtown Las Vegas and you should be ready to expect some traffic on your way there on the freeway. There are a few parking structures around the restaurant but you will need to pay for them (Update: I have been told that Pizza Rock offers free validated parking at the parking garage across the street at 3rd and Ogden. Ask about it people!).  Service was disappointing and extremely slow and the food was rather good but expensive and you would expect better quality for the price you pay. We all had the bottomless mimosas for $15 and I had the Mob Boss pizza for $32.   The main problem was that the food took over 45 minutes to get to our table and my pizza was cold by the time my friends got their food. The free appetizer we received unfortunately did not warm up my pizza even though it was a nice gesture. Finally, our waiter was also very slow to refill our mimosas since we had to wait over 20 minutes on several occasions with an empty glass despite several requests, telling us that \"he had other tables as well...\". A little rude maybe?  In the end, I would not recommend this place mainly because of service issues. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

I am a vegan so I always have reservations about menus. When we entered there was a line, but I saw the tables in the back...the line was for slice orders! I gave the lady my cellly and waited for the text. It was about a 20 minute wait...no prob! The waitress was kind, asked if we had any questions (immediate cool points) I told her I was vegan...now their menu has a vegetarian section which was gluten free (separate oven) but I wasn't so much concerned about the gluten as I was the cheese! So she suggested the Vedura which was sauce various veggies topped with feta cheese. She stated that she and many of her co workers don't eat meat and they make adjustments all the time! So I went with the Vedura minus the feta cheese! Uuum, you talking about flavorful! I kid you not it was the bomb!!!! Now my husband is not vegan so his choices were endless. He went with the NY with pep. He is a self appointed pizza guru . He said it was the bomb too! So bomb that he gave the chef mad props upon leaving!I highly recommend",

I've been here repeatedly in large and small groups various times, and the service has been spot on.     We booked the chef's table for 20 for our wedding after-party on 10/31/15. Booking via email was a breeze. It was an over-the-top busy night,which we expected. We ended up having more people, but the staff graciously smiled and just added more chairs.  Everyone's food was good, service was OUTSTANDING, and everything went great.  Every one of our servers and food runners were attentive, fun, and polite.  About 95% of our guests were first time visitors to Pizza Rock and were impressed with the food, environment, and service.  Thank you Pizza Rock for making the end of our wedding such a fun and easy event.   All of our guests really enjoyed the service and meal and plan on being repeat customers.  Edited to add that two guest have also booked the table for birthdays after the good experience they had at our Pizza Rock wedding after-party and have equally enjoyed their repeat experience.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the pizza window here at Pizza Rock. When you walk inside, towards your right you can buy pizza by the slice. To the left of that is the hostess stand and dining area. The line was short on one visit and longer on the next. They really move the line through nicely. They have some stools at the counter to the right of the register where you order, but it's a tight space and there isn't a lot of seating. I just plan on popping in and grabbing my slices to-go when I come here. I like that they offer the typical cheese ($4) and pepperoni ($4.50) slices as well as a different \"slice of the day\" ($6) each day. The slices are huge. You can't beat the price, portion or quality. I tried some Sicilian cheese and it wasn't bad, but could have been more crispy on the bottom instead of being a tad too soggy. I'd still give it another try during another visit.   They offer a variety of pizzas baked at a variety of temperatures here at Pizza Rock. I plan of trying most of them. The menu says only 73 of pizza champ Tony's award winning margherita pizzas are made per day. There are actually other pizzas that are made in limited amounts each day, but the margherita is a favorite. I'd call ahead if you are interested in any of the limited batch pizzas. Unless you are meeting a group of people here I'd just call your order in anyway for pick-up to avoid the parking hassles of downtown and have someone drop you off to grab your order. The pizza window is currently open until around midnight Sun - Thurs and until around 2 am on Friday and Saturday.",

Secondly, all the gluten free pizza!!

The arugula was fresh, and the large pepperoni slices were delicious.  The Gorgonzola fries were tasty as well, but a little light on the cheese. The molinari pizza I enjoyed a lot; it's a great mix of different meat flavors.  Our waiter was really attentive and nice -- overall, I really recommend Pizza Rock!",

The hostess was hostile from the start.  I understand, there's a convention in town and you have a lot of bookings for 7pm. We didn't have a reservation. When I let her know that, she was more than eager to throw in my face that it was going to be at least an hour and a half wait, with a side of extra attitude. I thought she was joking. I could see behind her that there were more than 10 open tables that could seat our party and several other smaller tables open. Ok, again I understand but I inquired again politely given the open seating. She wasn't helpful at all, more eager to tell us to get lost.  I get it. You have a bunch of reservations for 7pm. I said I'd get a drink at the bar and wait for a table and left her our number.  She wasn't encouraging. At 7:30 my friends were ready to eat my face off.  We picked up the phone and got a table down the street right away. It was a Monday night. The most aggravating part was that only a handful of parties showed up for their reservations! They only took up half the tables.  Why can't you seat me?! Your reservations didn't show? I'm here, we have money, we like pizza and we drink like sailors.  Are you hoarding pizzas in the back!?  What is the deal?   Let's break for some pizza math: 8 adults, 5-6 pizzas= $100+, 16-20 drinks $200ish x a few groups per night (they were turning others away too) = $500 per night in lost sales because your hostess would rather turn ppl away instead of find seats for customers.  Reservations make sense for fine dinning. This is pizza. Your reservations are gonna have a high no-show rate. Let people take an empty table.     ...And my favorite part. At 7:45, as soon as my hungry A*% hit the chair at the other restaurant, they called to say my table was ready.  Of course it's ready. You're restaurant was empty the whole time! So, I guess the wait wasn't 1-1/2hrs after all. Thanks mean hostess lady. Then they text and call me multiple times. I guess at almost 8pm on a Monday night the staff realized that maybe they should start letting people eat pizza.    It's not worth coming back here. This was silly and stupid. You can get pizza at 10 other places nearby. From now on, that's what we'll do.",

    "text": "We had newly arrived for my first trip to the city of sin and we decided to hit up Fremont Street on night number two to see what sort of trouble we could get into.  After a rocking great time listening to some 80's/90's band, a ton of great drinks and numerous trips into various bars and touristy shops we decided we wanted to try to get some great pizza, preferably New York style.  So with the aid of my trusty Yelp! app we determined there was a really good place named Pizza Rock nearby.  After a bit of walking we came upon a small place a bit off the beaten path but looked to be fairly busy with people going in and out getting individual slices of pie.    By the time we arrived it was getting a bit later so many of the patrons of this fine establishment, including my wife and I, were a bit inebriated and beyond hungry.   Thankfully our wait was not long as the guys slinging pies were on top of things and we got our order in.  The pies, like most New York style places, were already cooked and the guys waiting on us were just taking orders, then heating up the slices in the large oven behind them.  Both the wife and I went with traditional pepperoni (nothing fancy here) as we wanted to keep it simple and that was what they had the most of.    After about a five minute wait we were presented with some fantastically gorgeous, huge, floppy New York style pieces of pizza that I had seen in a long time.  Yes I let the fact go that the pepperonis were not the traditional New York style large, flat pepperonis go because they used the wonderfully small, slightly curled up cupping a tiny amount of grease (don't ever let anyone tell you that good pizza doesn't have grease on it, oh yes it does, just not too much!) on our pizza.  A few bites in and I knew I was going to give this place the highest rating I could because the pizza was freakin' delicious.  The cheese was gooey, the crust was nice and crisp on the bottom but had that big, floppy, New York style feel to it, with a slight bit doughy on the top and the crust at the end was fantastic tasting bread that you want to eat every bite of, not the big crust you end up tossing into the trash.  The sauce was a little sweet but very tomatoey and as mentioned before, the pepperonis were not only delicious looking but phenomenal tasting as well.  Everything about the pizza was top notch and I am getting hungry just writing about it.  Fantastic pizza and probably even more fantastic if you're a little drunk and a little hungry.  Don't hesitate to check it out if you're in the area.  If I lived in this area I'd be buying this pizza on a regular basis.    One last side note, the guys behind the counter seemed to be having a good time interacting with the crowd and were friendly to us.  Great to see someone enjoying their job and it really made the fantastic pizza all that much better.",

    "text": "No one comes to Vegas to just to eat pizza at Pizza Rock but they should.  Sure go watch the Bellagio fountains, take your picture with the Vegas sign, watch a show, gamble, visit the Mob Museum then eat here.  I liked the place so much that it's now a must stop anytime I'm in Vegas.    It's located in the old part of Vegas so if you visit the Mob Museum or Fremont St, it's right there. When you walk in the doors, you know you are immediately in a fun place.  There's a Jimi Hendrix painting on the wall, a classy bar with several TV's to watch the games, and a big huge semi truck with flames on the hood just because.  When you sit down you are presented with rock vinyl album covers which when you open them are menus.  My only complaint about the entire place was I had a Barbara Streisand album cover as my menu.  I was with 2 other people so we decided to split 2 pizzas.  We got a margarita which is served wet as it is in Naples.  The thing was amazing.  The crust had a perfect char and flavor.  It was up there with the best Margarita that I've ever had.  We also got the Quattro Carne which has as the name says 4 Italian meats, mozzarella, peppers, arugula, and goat cheese.  This was equally as good.  Their beer list was a good mix of styles, locals and imports.  The waiter knew his stuff about beer and gave me a great recommendation.  They have a few different wood burning ovens that are at different temperatures which are stated on your menu.  Different pizzas are cooked at pizza temps. They really know their stuff.",

The funny thing I found out is that they are owned by the same person Tony Gemignani. Pizza Rock not only has great pizza  it has such a cool environment and very nice staff. Next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely come back and bring my friends and family.",

We always start with the Calamari Fritti, which is excellent. We got half and half of the Traditional and Calabrese Style with both sauces - definitely the way to go. They're both really yummy! The calamari is nice and crispy and the sauces are delicious.   For pizza, we got the Chicago Cracker Thin Sam Giancana and they got the Michigan Ave. Both were amazing! :) They're huge pizzas too, so we both had a ton leftover. All of which got eaten in our hotel room later that night after a few hours of gambling and drinking haha.",

I mean where can you get a personal pizza with the highest quality ingredients for $5 (one topping)- PIZZA ROCK! The drink list was decent too- The Woodchuck Draft (Apple Cider) tastes better than Angry Orchard if you are into beers.   This visit the service was fast and our party of 3 was seated virtually immediately! As we waited for our food the ambiance tends to get me every time as I am fascinated watching all the music videos coincide with the great tunes from old and new being played. All they need is a stage and I am up there!  Food- I ordered the Tony Two Times ($7)- its a personal pizza with old world pepperoni, salami, mushrooms, the BEST Sausage and mozzarella! Talk about Tasty! I loved it! Let's talk about the crust! I mean its magical! By the looks of it you are thinking this is just some plain regular pizza crust, doughy as usual and no need to eat past the sauce... but after one crunchy flaky bite, soon you'll realize  this is not your average crust.  Don't believe me- try it for yourself.... Then share it on Yelp! :)  Worthy Mentions: If you valet park at the Downtown Grand- Pizza Rock will not validate   your parking. If you park in the Downtown Grand Self Park Garage they will validate. OH and they have BRUNCH!- Who knew! :)",

I ordered 8 different pizzas for the sole purpose that I wanted to try all the best that Pizza Rock had to offer. There were some winners and a few losers. The gluten free pizza...not for me. All the rest for 4-5 stars. The service was great and has been the same every time. I would recommend almost anything on this menu but the truth is I wouldn't order chicken from a steak house so why would I order anything but pizza from arguably the best pizza restaurant in Las Vegas",

The gluten free crust seemed to be the standard Udi's one you'll find at many restaurants across the country. My friend ordered a standard margherita. She said it was fine.   Loud music that I don't really consider Rock - like Call Me Maybe - played on the speakers, and there are plenty of TVs for sports viewing.

    "text": "Went to Pizza Rock tonight with my wife, daughter, and a family friend.  While I was aware they have an extensive menu, it was such a pleasant evening we wanted to eat outside.  Pizza Rock has a nice outdoor dining area adjacent to an ordering window that faces the alley at The Grand in downtown off 3rd street.       We went up to the window to order, but since we weren't 100% sure on what we wanted to order we went just inside the entryway to place our orders, since it's a bit quieter and we could here the servers/cooks better.  They had several varieties of pizzas to choose from all ready to eat similar to other pizza-by-the-slice restaurants.  I ordered 2 pepperoni slices, my wife got a pepperoni and a cheese slice, and the kids each got a slice of pepperoni.    The prices were reasonable my wife's and my 4 slices total and 2 sodas came to $22 which was about what I had planned on spending for a meal for 2.  The slices are very large, larger then other slices I've had from any other pizza-by-the-slice restaurant.  It was just enough to be a full meal without being too much.  The servers were very friendly and helpful too - quick and efficient.    We ate out in the aforementioned outdoor dining area, and had a great time together.  The location was fun, with many people coming and going, and the music from the Fremont Experience was keeping us rocking in our seats.  The pizza was hot and tasty.  I give the pizza 3 out of 5 stars, and the atmosphere, locale, and staff the 4th star.    I'm more partial to a New York style crust, a slightly thicker than cracker crust.  Pizza Rock was the extra thin crust style which is not my personal favorite.  The cheese was good, but average and the pepperonis flavorful but lacking any real oomph.  The best part for me was the sauce, which was a very light, and not overly tomato-ish which I find Sbarro's sauce to be.  Not my personal favorite, but quite good overall.   I would go back for slices at Pizza Rock, as we all had a blast and the pizza was good.",

    "text": "Great pizza. Ordered the regular pepperoni. The size of the pie was enough for two. The pepperoni curls perfectly and the spice was on point. The crust wasn't chewy and there wasn't an overwhelming amount. Great joint for late night pie. Flat panels everywhere and the price was on point and fair. Tim was our waiter and was very personable and chill. A Def stop for anyone craving east coast style large sliced pizza with a variety to choose from.",

    "text": "We came to pizza rock for a fast informal meal before going to the Smith Center for a play. We were warned that parking might be a problem. But actually it's no problem at all since they validate parking at the Grand Hotel. On walking in, there is a very noisy vibe. Our server came over almost immediately to let us know that she was busy with other tables but she would be with us as soon as possible. Not a problem. The number of pizzas on the menu is somewhat intimidating for those of us here for the first time. We settled on a very thin crust Pizza that came out almost wafer thin with excellent cheese and toppings. We also got salads. The Caesar salad was truly outstanding. The garden salad was just above average. The only thing wrong with the meal is that they seated a young couple down next to us that were drunk out of their minds and ended up leaving without paying the bill. They also managed to spill water all over the table.I felt bad for our server who did nothing wrong, got stiffed for her tip, and had extra cleanup.  Over all, very good pizza,  lots of choices on the pizza, and very good Caesar salad.",

    "text": "Okay. I love pizza, for many reasons, and this place is my late night, kinda drunk and super hungry so I can only be satisfied from a slice from here before I go home pizza place. It is everything I love about a great slice. It's a huge portion, I can taste all the ingredients so perfectly. Great crust and cheese and the pepperoni is different in a good way, small and spicy. The cooks that work up front are soo fun too! They are never annoyed with us, even though we can be a rowdy bunch sometimes. They are patient and treat us great. My personal favorite about this place is that they sell coke-cola in a bottle. That is a huge plus! Last time I was there I may or may not have been offered a meatball on a fork. Well, I was and it was delicious.",

    "text": "I've come to Pizza Rock several times since it's been open and even went to their mock service right before opening. Every experience I've had here has been wonderful! I've never had bad service and everything I've tried has been delicious!  Appetizers:  Fried artichoke - SO GOOD! I was shocked at how much I liked this dish because it seemed a little weird but it was delicious.  White wine clams - first time I've ever tried clams before and they were really yummy. I'm not really a seafood person, but the sauce made it not too ocean-y.  Green Beans: Garlic, flash fried, crunchy but not too crunchy. Really good, I could eat those all day.  Meatballs: Oh my gosh. I'm not a fan of red sauce but I can't go to Pizza Rock without getting a side of meatballs! Gorgonzola apple salad: my favorite salad! I don't always eat all the apples because I don't typically like fruit in my salads, but the walnuts and gorgonzola with arugula and the dressing they use is ridiculous. If you get this as a main course, I would suggest asking for chicken breast in it to make it a little more dense, but it could definitely be used as a appetizer to share or as a main course for one.   Pizzas:  Honey Pie: perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I've had this one a few times and sometimes it's a little too much spice for my liking, but the sweetness mellows it out a little.  Cal-Italia: MY FAVORITE PIZZA EVER! I could go on and on about how delicious and amazing this pizza is. In my opinion, this is the best pizza in all of Las Vegas. The balsamic reduction is SO GOOD. It's salty, sweet, cheesy perfection.  New Yorker: not my kind of pizza - too much meat for me. But the guys I was with when we got this one loved it.   Today I came for brunch with my mom. It was outstanding! The french toast ambrosia was out of this world. I was completely stuffed and still managed to eat all of it because it was so good! My mom got the meatball hash with scrambled egg white- it wasn't quite what we were expecting presentation wise but the flavor was excellent. Overall an extremely enjoyable meal. Our server, Ryan (blonde hair), was fantastic! He was very friendly and knew the menu really well. He was able to answer all of my questions and was quick at bringing us what we asked for. The bottomless mimosas and sangria was great as well - I highly recommend the sangria! delicious!",

Granted, I've had better pizza, meatballs and fries (by far) elsewhere but I like the location and the decor plus they have an awesome selection of pizzas and beers. Nice size place with lots of seating and I love that they have multiple styles of pizza ovens.  Margherita Pizza - I loved this pie when I had it at Tony's pizza spot in San Fran. I wasn't as in love with it here.  Meatballs - not grandma's but not bad either. The sauce was good and at 6 for $10 it wasn't horribly priced.  Fries - hahahahaha... next (please take this off your menu.. i would be embarrassed to serve those)  Beer - Blanche de Bruxelles on tap. Thank you!!!! \"Pissing Boy\" beer for everyone!  Service - ehhh... our waiter was a bit awkward and not great at answering questions we had. When I asked how much the beers were he just said \"it's not as expensive as elsewhere\"... ummmm.... thanks? He poorly explained the size of the sicilian pizza which we realized when we saw one come out after. But... he did give us 20% off on our bill for being locals so YAY!  We asked if they had a sicilian pie without all the crazy toppings and were told that \"we can take the toppings off but it's going to be the same price.\" So for the people like me that like a simple pizza... fugghetaboutit.. full price for you!  Hopefully some of these issues and inconsistencies are due to the fact that they haven't been open long. I wish them the best and I'll be back again in the future to try some different dishes.",

You can have up to eight different styles of pizza at a time.  2. The Cal Italia and the Diavola will have you at the first bite.   3. Calamari is sooo good and they have a spicy Calamari option. Seriously why doesn't everyone do this?!  4. The service, music, and atmosphere are all great.   5. Tony Gemigani has so many Pizza related accolades it's ridiculous but seriously he is the U.S ambassador of Neapolitan style Pizza and has won multiple contests and awards for his mad skills.

But this time I went I could remember and write a review about what I thought. although this time was just a pick up a slice and enjoy outside or head back to room sort of thing.   I had a $4 cheese slice and it just hit the spot. Hot delicious and fresh out of the oven for me to add red pepper flakes and a little extra Parmesan. My sister loved it so much the first night, she kept bugging me to grab another slice the next night. So we did! It was reasonably priced for the size of slice and flavor.

I would have given them 5 stars but service was off. Our waiter disappeared, no one of the other employees seemed to be able to find him, forgot his name. We had to ask the bartender for the rest of our food which were appetizers-Italian fries, calamari and fried artichokes after our pizza arrived?? Our Italian chopped salad was missing too. The bartender got upset, hopefully not with us, but our waiter when we asked for the salad for a second time. He went to find the manager because obviously our waiter went MIA. We got the rest of our food but the waiter didn't show up again till we asked for our check? REALLY BAD SERVICE! Management needs to oversee their staff better, hire friendly staff too",

I cannot think of anything else, my friends. We ordered:  Garlic bread - good, but not amazing.  Calamari - good, but not great. The spicy was crazy spicy though. I just wasn't a fan.  Sausage and Stout - I wasn't the biggest fan, but everyone else dug it.  New Yorker - yes. YES YES YES. SO GOOD! If you haven't tried this one, please do. Everything from the crust, marinara, and toppings were amazing! Old Chicago - Another YES. This was probably my favorite. Mostly because of that sausage.   Overall, this place was amazing. My favorite thing - the ricotta cheese. That stuff was so light, fluffy and flavorful. I don't eat pizza that often, but I have never craved it so much that I can't stop thinking about it for the next few days.   Top choice for Vegas pizza.",

    "text": "We got to-go slices three times over the course of 5 days. As self-proclaimed pizza snobs, my husband and I frequently seek out places to grab some slices anytime we travel.  Pizza Rock did not disappoint.  There are 6 options for slices to-go:  cheese, pepperoni, slice of the day, veggie (spinach, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, red onion, bell pepper, basil, oregano + pecorino romano), picante (pepperoni, linguica, chorizo, banana peppers, serrano peppers, green onion, ricotta and cholula hot sauce), purple potato (potatoes, pancetta, feta, rosemary and pesto). While the cheese slices cost $4 and pepperoni, $4.50, the other slices are $6 each.   We stuck with cheese slices each visit (hard to beat this classic for any vegetarian) and Pizza Rock was completely on point with the balance of tangy marinara, thin crust, and delicious cheese.    Even after a bout of horrible food poisoning on the last night we were in town, a Pizza Rock cheese slice was the only thing that sounded palatable!",

New York style with the thin floppy crust.    The best part of their pizza is the sauce.  They make the sauce from scratch, and you notice this immediately.  Hearty flavor!  It is actually part of bar and from the looks of it, it would be a great sports watching venue with its many large screen TVs...

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Tony Gemingani so it was only a matter of time, with me being a frequent visitor to Vegas, that I would visit Pizza Rock over in Downtown Vegas.   The menu is virtually the same from Tony's Pizza Napolitana in SF.  It includes his famous award winning Margherita which is cooked in under 2 minutes along with his vast assortment of pizzas from NY Style, Romana, California Style, and Gluten-Free.  And it also includes his famous meatballs and pasta dishes as well.  Don't forget to check out his burgers too.  Same menu, different setting and in this case, a very different setting where instead of the traditional Italian restaurant look from Tony's in SF, it's more of a heavy metal rock theme inside here which is quite fitting for Vegas actually.  That being said, the pizza is really top notch.  And although I've been to Tony's in SF a few times, there are still a lot of things on the menu that I still haven't tried.  My friends and I decided on their Cal Italia and the Honey Pie.  Cal Italia -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1bGfTSF&s=53472f263851536561c84f0ab23e24562b9a96f28ba416f24edc3c196e4d3e78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1bGfTSF</a> Gold Medal Winner - Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma,  Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction  Although I've been to Tony's three times, this is actually my first time trying his prize winning Cal Italia.  It's a very interesting pie in both looks and flavor.  Very sweet and savory from the figs and balsamic and prosciutto.  I really dug this pie and would definitely order it again next time I come back to either here or at Tony's in SF.  Honey Pie -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1kBVpvu&s=d5d94ce8f89f62f2dffa483f9bb2d000b4f4f8bfc439bb60874c536cec70c11f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1kBVpvu</a> Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese,  Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers I've had this pie before at Tony's in SF and I ordered it again to share with my friends in Vegas so they can try it for the first time.  It's a very unusual pie that has a very sweet and savory flavor with a little spicy kick to it.  If you've ever had a deep fried wonton at a Chinese restaurant and dip it in sweet and sour sauce, that's probably the most similar taste that I can compare this pizza to.  Although the caramelized fried onions were a little burned, it still tasted delicious.  But for some reason, I wasn't tasting the honey.  One honorable mention I recommend from is their Burrata Burger.  I didn't have this at Pizza Rock but I've had it at Tony's in SF.  I think it's very underrated because it's almost always overshadowed by the pizzas and everything else.  You get a 1/2 lb burger with burrata cheese and crispy prosciutto and it comes with a generous pile of parmesan garlic fries  (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ePXy9t&s=5e3840ebaae8853cd3b8d5df422b84f469ca5d34282f8e053e1cd0e4cf3208b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1ePXy9t</a>). Definitely worth trying out!    I think what I like best is that the wait time at Pizza Rock is considerably shorter than it's older bother in SF where the wait time for a table can be at the least close to 2 hours.  Though that could change if good word of mouth goes around.  It looks like Pizza Rock is off to a great start and with its extensive menu and popularity growing, I can see it doing very well in Downtown Vegas.",

It is 25 dollars for bottomless mimosas, sangria, or bloody mary's and one entree. We thought this was a great deal so we made a reservation. The mimosas were literally orange juice so we opted for the sangria instead. The sangria didn't have much alcohol in it either. They were probably trying to cut corners on doing a bottomless special, but I have frequented many bottomless mimosas brunches and have never been this dissatisfied. I will add that the live music was a nice touch! Pretty rockin",

The bacon bloody margarita had a tiny issue...the bacon hit the table before the drink. The server was super cool and helped us with suggestions.  If your anywhere near Fremont St this spot is a must. The crust on my New York style pizza was awesome. I seriously have never tasted anything like that before in my life. Thanks Pizza Rock for a great night of adult beverages and amazing pizza.",

    "text": "The food here (chorizo and mussels, NY pizza) was great, the service less so, but the thing that made the biggest impression to me was the atmosphere. It was just a little too in-your-face rock n' roll for me. Sure, I may be sounding like an old curmudgeon whose coffee is too hot, but I felt like the atmosphere was drowning out everything else here, including the wonderful pizza. It bothers me when a place tries too hard for a style (i.e. Double Down Saloon), and that is precisely what Pizza Rock does best. What the hell does rock n' roll have to do with pizza anyway? My guess is that the owner/chef loved rock n' roll, was a shitty musician, but a great chef. So he took what he loved and juxtaposed it with what he excelled at. The summation of this effort is Pizza Rock. With all of that said, let me be clear here that the pizza was lovely.  I will now go watch Murder She Wrote reruns on my plastic covered couch. Thanks.",

The Kobe beef burger was cooked perfectly and the Rosemary fries weren't overbearing at all. Perfect seasoned. The pizza I got was by the slice up front. The picantes favors melded perfectly together. Take a bite of the chorizo and the ricotta at the same time. Crazy result. The pizza of the day was sausage and pepperoni. Can't go wrong with that. Music was good and provided a rock style atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!",

The menu was a little intimidating at first, since they have such a wide variety of pizza types, and each type shows what type of oven it is baked in and at what temperature.   I selected the New York style pizza, and it was five star.....very fresh sauce seasoned to near perfection, superb crust, quality cheese.   It's hip, in one sense, but more hip in a 1998 kind of way, but that's fine because this place is about the pizza and service.  I enjoyed the mostly 1990's soft alternative rock playing while I was there.  The service I had was also five star, and I got a 15% locals discount.  I'd be proud to take out of town visitors here.",

Pizza Rock, that place is awesome, we ate there in Sacramento! \"  Really? Okay, gotta try it.  We had small pizzas each, I had the fresh mozzarella with a very light and delicate tomato sauce and it was perfection.  I did not try the other pizzas my husbands or our friends, that would have meant I had to share mine. No way! Everybody liked what they ate, we liked the food the service and the bar vibe. Pizza and beer something so simple but most dont get it right. Pizza Rock does and we will be back.",

Once we got sat, we wanted to have fun. We live in Vegas and understand if you want to go out, then you need to be prepared to spend money for having a good time. We tried to order a bottle of champagne, the server either didn't know what it was or didn't want to place the order for the easy $80 for her check. Once we walked her through what we wanted, we also tried to order a glass of wine... on a Saturday night, they were out of the only bottle of Pinot Grigio they carry. Okay, fine... move forward... we ordered the gluten free pizza, which is normally unreal great! The pizza came up, it was incorrect and then we had to wait for the creation of the new one. It was more like we were jerks for not taking the wrong one, maybe it was a fluke, or at least I'm hoping so... but for sure, left a bad taste in my mouth for going back to this location.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in quality & service!! Walking by, we spotted Pizza Rock & decided to give it a shot. We debated getting a table or just buying a slice to try it. We finally decided to just get slices. We saw people buying cheese slices, and the pizza looked great. And one note, the young guy cooking the pizzas was awesome (no name tag unfortunately)... he was very friendly & charismatic & is the type of employee any restaurant would want dealing with customers... if he were the only employee we encountered, the \"service\" would have been great. Sadly he wasn't the only one we dealt with.  By the end, we felt bad for him... it apparently isn't his fault that he's forced to overcook the pizzas this way.  So we ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza. The first two he brought out just looked disgusting... they weren't just burnt, they were BLACK! We said no... he offered to get 2 new slices.  But then we saw what he put in the oven to warm up... they looked exactly the same, they were from the same exact large pizza as the first two slices.  He handed them to us, and we thought \"maybe it tastes better than it looks.\" But first, we lifted it up... the bottom literally looked like asphalt, totally black on the bottom & the outer crust... burnt to a crisp... even the pepperoni was so tiny & curled & burnt.  We each took one bite off the tip, and all we could taste was burnt char and it literally crunched in my mouth like a cracker... not even good crispy pizza 'crunches' like that, it was hard & crunchy & only tasted like char!  No other flavor!  We said \"No, we can't eat that.  Why are all the pepperoni ones burnt? Why not take one out sooner, so they look like the cheese pizzas?\"  The guy said \"I have to leave it in longer to cook the pepperoni.\"  Really?  Why does NO other pizza place have to BURN it to cook the pepperoni? That just makes no sense, sorry!  We finally asked for a manager to get a refund, because he took another new pepperoni pizza from the oven, and it looked exactly the same, blackened & charred. The manager, Joel (we were told later, he never bothered to introduce himself), finally came out (after waiting quite some time, guess they only have 1 on duty at a time)... and was extremely sarcastic & unfriendly the entire time. He stated that we were the ONLY complaints he'd had all day long. Okay, that's fine, we explained, but we ARE NOT eating that burnt pizza they offered us twice!  Also, I wish I had thought to tell him right then... numerous other people in line at the same time didn't seem to care, and we asked a big group of them \"Don't you care that it's so burnt?\"  Their reply was \"We're so drunk & hungry, we could care less right now.\"  Ahh, near all the bars, especially for a big event in town, lots of people so drunk they don't care WHAT they eat... so that's why nobody was complaining!!  We were also starving at this point... we'd already been waiting over 30 minutes for 2 slices... but we weren't hungry enough to eat black, charred, flavorless pizza. After arguing about the burnt-ness of the pizza, Joel finally voided our transaction to refund our purchase... the then stated they were cooking us 2 more slices in a different oven inside the main kitchen... we never asked for that and at this point, we didn't want it... but he 'informed' us of that, and walked away... didn't give us a chance to tell him 'no thanks'... we'd been standing there about 40 minutes now, we were NOT waiting another 10-15 minutes for another burnt pizza... or worse. So we told the NICE young man cooking to please let him know we aren't interested, we'd rather leave & eat elsewhere.  So if you like burnt, charred, overcooked pepperoni pizza, this is the place for you.  Or if you like plain cheese pizza, that LOOKED pretty good!  Just not sure why they can't cook them the same... if the pepperoni slices looked ANYTHING like the cheese slices, nice golden brown crust & bottom... we'd probably be customers for life!  Sadly, they cook their pepperoni pizza to death, and have managers who are snide & sarcastic & downright unfriendly to their disappointed customers.  So we have no desire to return, and will never recommend this place to anyone.  Shame, because we're always looking for good pizza places. We ended up finding pizza elsewhere... guess what, it was cooked properly, but not burnt... imagine that!",

I'm not sure where the main head of the talent is/went but why is anyone not trained on wood oven pizza allowed to work your oven if your an award winning pizza magician -[if pizza is the craft to respect! ] We waited 22 minutes on a pizza that in a 900 degree oven should be perfect in 30-45 seconds- we were told the pizza takes awhile to make- when we stood up & walked over to the oven it was empty.. The waitress hurried over a said \"where's the pizza that was in there..?!\" The kid replies \" no good-it's no good- do over\"  @ that point over 20 minutes in we walked.. & the waitress stopped us saying try us again - he's not trained on that oven ..we then drove the far drive to sette bello- where we should hv not strayed from just to support \"downtown\"",

The BAD, the menu is difficult to understand. I was at a table with six people and we were all really confessed and actually almost walked out. That and because they did not have the beer we wanted. The GOOD, The pizza we ordered was great. The pesto pizza and the old fashion pepperoni was also wonderful. If you are in the downtown Fremont Street area I highly recommend you give this place a shot. Triple George's is just around the corner and it to is yummy!!",

Both were amazing high quality pizzas with excellent ingredients. They were a little on the pricey side but the quality was clearly there. We also went for early dinner at 430PM on Saturday and hardly waited. Our server was Amber, who was also fantastic, friendly, and helpful. Great tap selections. Go!! Do not hesitate.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this pizza joint after having some drinks on Fremont so we decided to stop in. Parking is either is any of the garages or on the street which is metered except on Sundays and holidays.  Our first encounter was a group of us ordering pizza by the slice at the entrance since the restaurant itself was closed (late night). It won us over for sure!  Our second trip here we came for dinner and got to sit in the restaurant this time around. Very nicely decorated inside, tables galore! Bar is in the back of the restaurant surrounded by televisions everywhere. Bathroom was nice too.  The service was great, we wanted to customize our pizza order a bit so our server pointed us in the right direction as to the type of pizza we were looking for so that it didn't cost us an arm and a leg. She was prompt at filling drinks as well!  We were already sold on the Classic Pepperoni pizza from our first visit so we ordered that, the Boss 32 and the Classic Meatballs (a must try, the sauce is delicious)! Everything came out so fresh and hot! I thought it was cool that they carry 2 sized of bottled Coke. :)  Some of their pizzas can get pricey but if you stick to the basics, it'll be fine!  Great pizza joint! The classic pepperoni reminds me of pizza back home on the east coast! Give it a try!",

They were playing fantastic music lol a mix of old and new from will smith to Taylor swift to whoever sings that song cherry pie to sweet home Alabama  our service was pretty quick but I wish our waiter was a bit more attentive to us.. it would have resulted in a better tip.

Parked at The California Hotel and walked a few blocks to the restaurant.  The menu was extensive with many styles of pizza to choose from.  Kids each got pizza from kids menu.  Kids pepperoni was COVERED with pepperoni.  My daughter loved it.  Crust was nice and chewy and perfectly crunchy along the edge.    Hubby and I shared a thin crust Chicago \"cracker\" style sausage pie.  True to form, the pizza came cut in a grid/squares not pie sliced.  Crust was super thin, sausage flavorful, sauce tangy and full of garlic.  Which I love, but my husband thought it could do without so much garlic.  I also had Caesar salad with grilled chicken.  Nothing spectacular about the salad.  The chicken was a bit dry, but what the heck, it's a pizza joint.  I would definitely visit again.",

Inside is great for dining if you are with a group. If you just want a slice or 2 of pizza then check out the pizza window. The line can get crazy long but the guys working behind the counter do a great job at keeping the line moving. Slices start at $4 and they are huge. What I like about this pizza window is that you can try a few different types of pizza without getting a whole pizza of the same or half and half. Another thing you can get at the window is a side of their meatballs and I recommend you do that.",

They have some great Belgians and IPAs on tap for a great price...even better during happy hour. The number of different pizzas is daunting at first but once you navigate your way through it and find a couple pizzas you and your friends would enjoy it ends up being perfect for all the different tastes at the table. I explicitly mention friends here because the best experiences I've had at Pizza Rock have been with large groups where there are many pizzas and lots of beer on the table. All the pizzas I've had have been fantastic. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of all of them -- I can tell you I've had the margherita, which was excellent, a sicilian that was loaded with meat, a pizza with some fried onions on it, standard New York style slices of cheese pizza, and a pizza with arugula, prosciutto, and cherry tomatoes, which is my favorite of all the pizzas I've had. Pizza Rock is definitely worth checking out. Expect a long wait to be seated on Friday and Saturday nights, though.",

BUT I warn you, get the big slices up front at the counter or order an extra large pie. I'm not kidding, they are incredible. The smaller pies just don't taste the same! The big pies are actually in my top ten favorite pizza in the world, the smaller pies just don't taste the same to me. I wish someone could explain why that is! I'm not crazy - actually I am, but not in this feeling lol.   Also, the ranch is SO GOOD. I could drink it.  I actually have at times.... don't judge me. I love ranch and I love it more on my pizza. Tip from Lauren: add ricotta cheese to whatever pizza or slice you get. The pepperoni is also really good here. I always get plain pepperoni or pepperoni & ricotta, simple perfection. And I drink the grease. Why do I drink weird shit here....? Because it's SO GOOD.",

    "text": "I've been to Pizza Rock a handful of times. I'm writing this review based on my experience today. I ordered a pizza over the phone to be picked up 20 minutes later. I arrived on time and saw there was a huge line at the pick-up/ order by the slice area.   I waited in line for an additional 15 minutes which wasn't great but not too bad either. The reason I'm giving three stars is I noticed the two cooks weren't exactly careful in regards to cleanliness. I don't blame either one at all; it seems like a management issue. The cooks were making the pizzas, taking the orders, and accepting payments. It annoyed me to see two hostesses just standing at the register looking super bored and super unhelpful. If they see these two are slammed, why not help out and take orders/ payments while the cooks actually cook?   All I could think about was how many germs were on my pizza. The cook was all over the place in that tiny work station and just touching everything including the register. I paid $27 for one pizza; I'd like the cleanliness to reflect that. Even Little Cheeser's keeps cooks/ cashiers separate.",

The Cal Italia sounds like something we would not normally try, but it is a must!! The flavors work incredibly together. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, and nice and cheesy. The Tony Two Times is a little more classic but just as delicious. The happy hour is great and allows you to try several different options. The zucchini fries were great as well. Almost like you are eating a cheese stick.... seriously!!",

The girl up front was really nice and explained it in a way that kept us on the hook.  So glad she did.  We were over at the Fremont when the text came that table was almost ready. I replied with a \"1\" that we were on our way. Super smart on their part. Even had an option to cancel if needed with text.   Got a seat with great views of TVs and football games.  Much better than anything over in the Grand. We had to order the meatballs based on the reviews.  They did not disappoint.  Very tasty. The \"New Yorker\" Pizza was very good and I would recommend it highly.  We ordered the chopped salad to split between the three of us.  I think they forgot it cause we had to ask after the pizza came. No biggie, but when it came it was just ok. Would not recommend that salad.   Overall, I would come back if in area. I would never  stay at the Downtown Grand Hotel again so not sure if i will.   Great Place, atmosphere.",

The ambiance of the place is fun and sophisticated at the same time. The service was exceptional and most important the pizza was incredible!   Tried the sausage and brew pizza and wow!  Definitely going back the next time we are in Vegas to try another of their crazy good signature pies!",

It took three hours to get an incorrect order with a 10% discount because it's not our fault we had someone quit on the spot.   This place is a joke. The food was terrible, the attitude of the people was even worse. The chef should be absolutely embarrassed of the way his team managed a rough situation. It's unfortunate when staff bails mid shift, don't take it out on your customers.   Don't go, don't give them the benefit of the doubt. Dude called the cops on another patron during the chaos. It was a S-show!  I've literally never felt the need to review before, positive or negative. This experience has changed me fundamentally as a human.

This place has been booked marked for a while and I have sent people here to try it out and always had great things to say about the pizza. So finally I had the chance to come here and we ordered their New Yorker and The Margarita that they make only 73 of every day. Not sure if the quantity but I'm sure I'm close. Lol   The New Yorker, was the best for me. Rich ricotta, thick tomato sauce and good quality pepperoni. It was so yummy!   The margarita pizza, had a good char, tasty crust but fell flat on the overall taste. They also gave it to us late but very nice enough to take it off the bill. So A+ for customer service   I noticed they also had a pizza by the slice counter and window outside. It was pretty busy and they had more people waiting. I'd definitely come back again and try the rest of the items on the menu.",

The picante slice had burst of flavor with the banana peppers and jalapenos. The ricotta cheese balanced out the heat. Rosemary fries had a pungent flavor (not a rosemary fan). The fried artichoke was nice and salty, and came with a delicious spicy dip. However no one else at the table liked the artichoke. You can order by the slice at the front only, not when seated. Will try the meatballs next time.",

Only negative is having to pay to park there. Downtown Vegas charged $12 for me an my wife to park. They should have validated parking if you patronize businesses downtown. Our server, Gabriel, was on his game, too.",

We got the margherita and the cal Italia and I seriously felt like I was in HEAVEN.   Best part was when I heated it up the next day, it was just as good.

We are a large party of 11 and they are upset that we pushed 2 tables together- because they were not helping us. Therefore we did what was needed.  Then we received rude behavior from the manager on right now.  To be treated with this type of harshness, when we love this pizza is not cool... Then the manager left all of us, went to her waitresses, rolling her eyes. Why? What is the purpose of treating people in this way? Interesting what happens with \"managers\" who behave lacking in care of customer service.",

Knowing they not serve only pizza but some other good food, we decided to try calamari and some fried artichoke everything was very good really. So we order this famous wood fire oven pizza 900 degree. When the pizza come to our table it's look good but the crust didn't taste good. It was soft and not chard like it suppose to be on a 900 degree wood fire oven so I suspect they didn't cook In a 900 degree and that is sad really sad. I know the restaurant wasn't busy at all but it's not an excuse. The waitress should told us their wood fire oven was off and they will use their electric stone oven but NO she didn't so I am very very disappointed. I told her when we left her pizza wasn't great n I was mad they didn't use the right oven but NO respond from her.  Very very disappointed.",

The menus are fun and there are many unique choices, in addition to standard pizza options from around the world. You can come here with a large party and partake in the Fremont street party scene. Or have an intimate date night in one of their cozy booth cubbies. We eat at Pizza Rock whenever we attend an event in the Fremont street area. Sometimes I will find an event in that area, mainly to drag my friends or family downtown for some Pizza Rock :)",

The food was exceptional and reasonably priced, service was fantastic, and we took advantage of a very generous happy hour to try a few new things that are now favorites.  Over the course of two very yummy visits, we had quite the assortment of dishes.  One highlight was the Gorgonzola Fries - I would never have thought of that and now I'm addicted.  They were so good, I could not stop eating them and almost made myself sick.  The Honey Pie pizza was incredible, spicy and sweet and crazy good.  For all us vegetarians that watch the world eating hedonistic bacon-y indulgences and wonder where ours might be, this is it - the Honey Pie had all those fatty, salty, sweet, hot, incredibly delicious notes in a vegetarian vehicle.  One of the best things I've every eaten.  I've always loved Tony's fried artichoke appetizer and it's still a favorite.  The fried green beans were delicious, and felt virtuous and healthy compared to everything else we ate on our trip.  Loved them.  Hubby loved the slider and the meatballs and stromboli are always a favorite of his, it's nice to have constants between Tony's restaurants.  My new favorite drink is the Pineapple Fizz - so refreshing and not too sweet, just really drinkable and wonderful.  Honestly the best food we had in Vegas, and by far the most affordable.  Loved the little romantic booths and the overall decor.",

I have been to a few places around town but this hidden gem is definitely the best place I have been to. We tried the New Yorker pizza and the Gorgonzola salad. Our friends had the Margherita pizza and a side of Rosemary fries. We started off with a sangria and Guinness at the bar. Service was quick and the bartenders were really attentive. No problem switching our tab to our table once the rest of our group showed up.  The wait time for the fresh food was definitely worth it. We are thinking of coming back for the Sunday brunch special ($15 per person) or for their happy hour sometime during the week (varies by day).  Whether it is date night or you want a place to eat with friends, this place is wonderful. The interior has a cute rock/classic car vibe with music to match!   Check out their website for details on the pizza   I saw Gluten and Vegetarian options for those who may need it. Parties 8+ get charged gratuity so keep that in mind when you have a large group.   #pizza #vegetarian #gluten-free #bestofvegas",

    "text": "IT'S NATIONAL PIZZA DAY!! So first place we headed after landing in Vegas was a pizza joint close to our Air BnB. Surprisingly, the Italian fries were ON POINT. Crispy and filling, and oh so flavorful. We tried the rosemary garlic and the truffle. I wonder if we could mix the two. Mental note to ask for this. The group loved both but we ended up ordering a second order of the rosemary garlic because garlic is life.   They definitely have a large selection of pizza cooked in different ways. We went for ones that won awards - the Margherita and the Cal Italia. The Margherita was a big underwhelming disappointment. The flavor was good but the sauciness soaked into the crust, making it soggy - had to fork and knife it. As for the Cal Italia - we inhaled the crap out of that. The fig preserves gave this pizza an extra oomph that made us end up ordering another one.   Sangria was good, rose option was good, and service not bad. Since it's in the Fremont area it wasn't packed and covered in tourists, which is a win win win.",

One 2 separate occasions this trip, gentlemen who appeared to be some degree of homeless (and maybe struggling with mental illness) came in while I was waiting and asked for ice. On both occasions, the women not only gave the ice, but offered water. These are good people. Come eat this pizza.  I'm so happy right now. Traveling all day, starving and needed to eat something quick so I can nap before a show tonight. This little piece of heaven is right across the street from my hotel.  Right. Across. The. Street. We just had two huge slices of real wood fire oven pepperoni pizza and 2 bottles of water for $15.  We have 7 days left and I'm predicting an embarrassing amount of pizza consumption, at least for me.  It's gonna be a good week",

Who woulda thought figs and Gorgonzola would taste so amazing, especially considering I'm not a fan of either ingredient. But, it works and I can't wait to have it again. Meatballs were delicious & zucchini fries were breaded and cooked perfectly crispy. Service was excellent too!! We will definitely be back when we visit Fremont Street again. If we lived locally, we'd be here at least once a week for this great happy hour menu.",

We came at traffic hour on a busy week night, apparently. But, we walked Fremont Street, enjoyed the view and atmosphere, and came back in time to dine.   Our waitress was a doll. I had inquired about a chicken BBQ pizza and she suggested an accommodation on the menu to make it happen. It was BEYOND my craving. Seriously. Just amazing.   The kids food came rather quickly and they were able to enjoy their food while we waited, which is always more pleasant. Our pizza took a bit longer. To be honest, I didn't even notice. In fact, the waitress comped our meal due to the \"unacceptable (in her opinion) wait\" which was completely mind blowing to me. She ended up receiving it as her tip.   We will definitely be back our next trip out to Vegas. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",

They also custom make a lot of different things for you they have coal fired pizza as well as deep dish. Pretty much runs the gamut of whatever pizza lover would enjoy.

I knocked a star off because the service wasn't the friendliest, but they were busy, and we knew the kitchen was having technical issues. We were looking forward to trying the Sicilian pizza, and we did- the focaccia it was made on was super tasty. Love the arugula as a topping. Someone else in our group got the Neopolitana and it looked amazing!! The happy hour specials are really well-priced, although my well drink wasn't very strong.",

    "text": "My first Pizza Rock experience was a Picante slice from the walk-up slice counter during a guys' trip to Vegas over a year ago.  I was impressed with what I got to the point of buying Tony Gemignani's book \"The Pizza Bible\" and practically begging my wife on our last trip this past January to go back to try one of their whole pies.  I was unsuccessful.  This trip, however, proved to be a different story as she was the one to suggest having lunch at Pizza Rock on Wednesday.  We arrived around 11:30AM and decided to sit at the bar.  The fact that Pizza Rock had so many different styles of pizza using a variety of different flours cooked in an array of different oven types at differing temperatures immediately caught my eye (and made my task of selecting a pie for us to share a difficult, but enjoyable task).  There were a lot of other interesting and delicious sounding antipasti, pasta, burgers and sandwiches, and calzones to choose from, too, but we came for the pizza.  We decided on the 12\" Cal Italia ($19), an eye-catching pie, topped with Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, fig preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Balsamic reduction.  The toppings were high quality and offered a beautiful contrast of salty and sweet, but the crust was the real star.  It had the perfect amount of char around the edges giving some crispiness, but had the right amount of chew throughout.  My wife isn't nearly as much of a pizza lover as I am, but if she truly enjoys something and says so, then it must be good.  She loved our pizza.  I think the odds are very good that we'll back to try more.  One of the best things about our visit was the service.  I was feeling the effects of the dry air/allergies/fighting off a cold.  The bartender (I think his name was Jimmy) observed my discomfort and asked if he could made me something to provide some relief.  Next thing you know, a hot toddy appeared in front of me.  While it didn't cure me, it did make me feel better.  Now THAT is the epitome of attentive, personal service and for that alone, I will come back again and again!  There are plenty of amazing pizza places in the world.  I certainly haven't been to all or even most of them.  However, based on my personal experience, Pizza Rock is at the top of my list for the best pizza to pass across my lips and I can't give it any higher recommendation.",

Let me say the place is a lot larger then I thought with ton's of seating and a decent size bar. I decided to go with a tall boy can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) brown bagged and the $7 personal size pie. The pizza dough was chewy and a bit burnt on the bottom but never less it was good. The sauce though was lacking a bit sweet but bland and the cheese was ehhh ok. Topping on the pizza was really good I'll give credit where it is due.  I kinda felt maybe the personal size pie was a little bit on the cheaper end of quality and that it's not what I would say is the standard here so I would have to give the place another run around to see if it hits the spot with a larger pie. My first impression with the happy hour pie was basically not far off from Domino's. Spoiled growing up in New Jersey with pizza? maybe but for now I'm giving it 3 stars not the worst by far but not what I expected. Customer service was great though attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Honestly probably the worst service ever. I work in the industry. So after we order bottomless drinks the server made it VERY CLEAR that we had to order a entree. Which h first off isn't stated in the menu and no other place makes you buy a entree for bottomless drinks for brunch. Second off we had two mimosas each (party of 13) and he told us we need to slow down or the bartender will get mad. So a couple of us ordered food for the table and the server kept telling us he is cutting us off cause we aren't ordering things. We literally left because the server was so awkward and disrespectful. We would have stayed for the super bowl but you lost 13 customers who will never come back.  I wish it wouldn't rate you one star cause you're not worth that.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock gets the job done if I am craving a good slice. I waited to write this because I've had multiple different experiences here. First being a Yelp Elite event, then again a few times with friends and family. Overall, I'd say I go with four stars because no matter what small dilemma, the food has pretty much always been on point. Usually there is a wait. I have had both fast service and super slow service. The variety of items is what I like. You have a ton of types of pizza. All with fresh handmade dough and only the finest ingredients. The meatballs and garlic fries are both solid appetizers. If you like calzone, the one here is worth trying.  Maybe its the newer popularity of the downtown craze bringing in more tourist, but I would hope for better customer service from the host stand.  PS- Try anything with New York, NY, or New Yorker in the title.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock was an enjoyable dining experience. We arrived just before the 3 pm happy hour on a Friday and were given some fun menus designed as record album covers with menu records inside. There are three varieties of happy hour Italian fries. We ordered fries with both gorgonzola sauce and crumbles. Some fries were crispy and some were soft in texture. The flavor was very good and the portion size was very generous for $4.00. Next we ordered a personal size  pizza with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni that was $7.00. It was cut into 6 slices. The crust was thin, golden brown and crispy. The restaurant is known for making extra thin crust pizza. The pizza smelled good & spicy and presented with large pieces of tasty sausage and appetizing little round Pepperoni's. Everything was so good! The regular menu prices for a whole pizza were a bit more expensive at around $23 to $28 dollars although they probably are also quite delicious. The hostess was friendly and cheerful greeting us we entered and exited. Our server was helpful in explaining the menu items. The decor is fun. There is a  semi-truck cab pertruding out into the dining area from the outside wall and wall paper made to look old, multi-layered  and vintage in the area of and leading to the restrooms. I recommend coming here for the happy hour prices on the tasty menu items available.",

    "text": "This was my first time ever going to this establishment. Needless to say while the food was nothing short of amazing, I cannot say the same for the service we received from Jimmy. We sat at the bar and did not even get acknowledged for a good six-seven minutes while Jimmy walked back-and-forth in his own little world. We finally ordered a couple drinks and chose to order our food at the same time. Not only was Jimmy's whole demeanor unwelcoming, but the furthest thing from a warm welcome that you can receive from a consumer driven business. He barely even spoke when I ordered a glass of wine, and what do you know? He couldn't remember if the wine I had JUST ordered was red or white. So we eat our food (which arrived in a timely manner) and ordered another round of drinks which mind you; took another good 10 minutes after our food was served. Yet again, he did not even bother to check on us to ask how the pizza was. We seemed more of an inconvenience to him than paying customers. Finally he gave us the most recent receipt for the last round of drinks and food. He proceeded to ask us if we wanted a box for the pizza and that was the last time we saw him for yet another good 15 minutes. We ended up having to bring the bill to him with our credit card to pay because that's how much he truly paid no mind to us as he was too busy having social hour in the opposite corner. This is my first and probably last time I will come here, and it's a shame because the food was excellent. You have one job as a bartender, and that's to take care of your customers; not to treat them like burdens.",

A great restaurant that has different sites needs to focus on a consistent menu and product taste.  When I asked for my two favorites the Original tomato pie or the Delarenzo it was not to be found.  I settled on the New Yorker.  What a mistake.  The pizza showed no balance over powering low fat ricotta cheese no mozzarella, pizza sauce that had zero taste and high in acid.  Small portions of sausage.   Again nothing like the perfect pizza you get at the other two locations.  The Stromboli had no pepper and was over powering with ricotta.  Someone in the back must love the stuff. Again, no consistency with Tony location in San Francisco or pizza Rock in Sacramento.  Please visit this location and fix your pizza problems.",

We got the meat lover because my bf is big on meat and I picked the white pesto sauce, which honestly was the only thing good about our pizza. The meat was okay, our biggest thing was that everything slide off of the pizza so you had to either eat with a fork, or try and bite it very fast once you lift it up. Giving it three stars because we had to stare down the waiter to check on us every time we needed something. The inside was super cool with the semi truck, yet the tables were all so close we felt like we were eating with the four guys next to us.",

    "text": "On 4/15/19, I tried to make a reservation for 12 online at 6 pm but 10 is max online and site said I had to call the restaurant.  I called and the hostess told me two times the reservation system was down. I sensed some annoyance in her tone since I called her back twice as she told me to.  On the third time she rudely told me the system was down yet again still told me there were no more tables until 10 anyway so she couldn't accommodate me. I told her the online system is taking the reservations so she is wrong and her customer service was appalling.  So I booked a reservation online for 10 hoping to add a few chairs.  Meanwhile the preferred slots got filled so we moved to 5 pm.  Food was not what I experienced first time a month prior and on one occasion when we asked for refills the waiter looked at my daughter and said I'm not your server and abruptly walked away rolling his eyes yet took the tome to yap with the other servers in the back.  I had one beer in two hours because never was I asked for another refill.   We had to wait three times for plates and silverware.  They took rolled silverware off of the adjacent table while it was undergoing cleanup from previous guest.  Yuck! Oh yeah, I wasn't asked for box to take leftover pizza and had to go get one at the bar.  Worst part was at least 10 open tables.  I will never go back.  I tend to post my experience on Yelp too.  I took my French friends there to experience the best pizza in Vegas.   The travesty besides one beer in two hours was they paid the bill.  They were not impressed none the least.",

    "text": "Pizza restaurant/pub located in Old Las Vegas near Fremont St.  The restaurant is in the touristy part of town but not as crowded in the strip. The front of the location offers pizza by the pie or slice to go. Inside is a large restaurant and bar.  What I did like about the establishment was the friendly staff, extensive pizza selections, and the fact they played old music videos on one of the many television screens.  What did not work and the reason for 2 stars is that we were very clear with the waitress that we could not have fontina cheese on the pizza because my dining partner was allergic. Halfway through our meal he started feeling bad and could not eat. He had food poisoning all night and the next morning.  I did enjoy the pizza and I did not get sick which makes me think they put the fontina cheese on anyway.",

Happy hour goes from 10pm-close, and includes a variety of appetizers and pizzas ranging from $4 to $7.   We each ordered a beer ($2off all drafts during HH) and started with the garlic bread. Not something we would normally order, but what can I say, the drunchies were real. It was good, but not great. It either needed to have more garlic butter on it, or be served with a side of marinara, as it was a tad dry. The pizzas on the other hand, were so damn good! We ordered the Tony 2 Times, as well as the server's recommendation called the Cal Italia and it might be the best pizza I've ever had. The perfect blend of sweet and salty!  I wonder if they'll deliver to California?",

And even if bees didn't have knees, I would glue knees upon bees to illustrate the point of how good the meatballs are here.  Not to mention the pizza.  They have both a walk-up by the slice area, as well as sit down.  Their personal pizzas are excellent.  Their calzones are the size of footballs or very small babies, and full of cheesy, meaty goodness.  I covered the Bacon Bloody Mary in the \"Tips\" section, but if you didn't read that, get that too.  Downtown consistently pleases me with their food choices that have popped up over the last few years.  Pizza Rock is another fine example of \"good eatin'\", and I am all about this place.  And it's reasonably priced as well, especially happy hour.  It's also right next to The Grand, so it's in that newly renovated 3rd Street area, and that's an excellent location to just hang out, eat, and people watch.  I'm looking forward to eating outside when it is not stupid cold.  Definitely a recommended venue.",

I've had the gluten free pizza, it's terrible, but to be fair, gluten free food blows.   I've had a burger, it was only OK, again to be fair, it's a pizza joint and I couldn't ask them to make legit burger. The fries where good tho.  I've had a personal cheese pizza, but I was drunk and all I remember was my stomach ache the next morning.   My latest visit was to watch game 1 of the NBA finals, a game in which this place showed, but didn't play the sound for, it was the game lebron was having cramps due to the a/c being broken in san antonio, but I didn't know that's what was happening, I thought something was seriously wrong with america's best current athlete.   Regardless, that night a friend of mine and myself got 2 pizzas. The crispy Chicago thincrust w/pepperoni and a regular cheese, both were OK, but for the boasting and carrying on by this place puts out there and the ridiculously price, it was substandard pizza and I can't see myself every going back for a meal, unless someone else is treating. I've given this place too many chances. Also, my stomach was ruined for the next 2 days.   I have a philosophy when it comes to pizza, if you do it right, you don't need all the bells and whistles. This place has an enormous menu, too many styles of pizza, I have a tip for pizza rock, get good at making one kind first, it's a clear over compensation.   Finally, the people here are all very nice and they do have a $5, 32oz. pbr, which is only $3 dollars during happy hour, but with that said, they have destroyed the beautiful simplicity of good pizza and also the hopes of a great downtown pizza shop.",

    "text": "Quite simply it was a brilliant experience as far as a pizza restaurant goes.    It's located in the heart of downtown Fremont, right across the street from the Grand hotel and casino.    Wander in and you'll be absorbed by the black interior and its strong grab at being 'rock 'n roll'.  It kind of works.  It kind of doesn't.  But there are some private tables for more intimate dining and there is also a pretty cool looking bar area.  But where it counts - the pizza.  They have so many different ovens and cooking types it made me curious to see their kitchen - it must be massive.  It's either massive or they're lying and every pie goes into the same oven.  But I wouldn't call their bluff.  Don't quote me, but I believe they have 9 different types of ovens/cooking styles.  I ordered the Neapolitan Margarita pizza with a friend.  It was beautifully cooked, fresh, and simple.  I'd highly recommend it for anyone.  The music blasting through the speakers isn't half bad either.  It doesn't make for an quiet dining experience - but the place is called Pizza Rock so that wasn't a surprise neither.    If you like rock and you like pizza variety - I'm going to stretch and say you'll also like Pizza Rock.",

Its an incredibly spacious restaurant with lots of different pizza options.  I ordered the highly recommended margherita pizza and the 3 meatball appetizer. This was (WAY) more than enough food for one person. I was really pleased with the meatballs. They were tender, meaty and swimming in a great red sauce.  The pizza was not my favorite. It edge crust had a nice char, but the center was slightly underdone (and a bit cold). I will preface this by saying the the mozzarella, fresh basil and the bright tomato sauce were all perfect. Also, I know that this pizza is not meant to be crisp, but the center was distinctly uncooked. Being the slob that I am, i just cut off the corner of each slice and enjoyed the rest.  My server seemed a bit distracted, but was prompt and helpful. Overall, a good lunch.",

The Sicilian pie with the prosciutto and arugula and salami is to die for. The crust is soft and pillowy the way Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn used to be and all of the crazy unique combinations of pizza toppings are amazing. Soooo good. I hope Vegas realizes the treasure they have here.",

They have a huge dining room and full menu and I'm guessing you can order a specialized pizza \"your way\" there.

    "text": "Pizza Rock is located just off Freemont street. They have almost every type of pizza you can think of! Which is good if you come with a large group, because then you can try more than just one pizza. It was just my husband and I, and we weren't going to be able to take any leftovers, so we had to find a smaller pizza to order, that was also on the cheaper end (some of the pizzas can get pretty $$$). We ordered a Neapolitan style margharita pizza, and it was fantastic. The reason for my 3 stars is the service and the appetizer. We sat at our table for at least several minutes before a server came to take our drink order (the restaurant was about 80% empty at this time). Then we had to wait a while for the drinks (which was just a water and a beer...). More often than not, the server was never around when we needed her. As our appetizer we ordered the woodfired asparagus, which came with prosciutto. We imagined asparagus stalks individually wrapped in prosciutto. Instead, it was one large pile of asparagus wrapped together, which made it difficult to cut. It was good anyway, but not great. With all the places to get pizza, I don't think we will be back here.",

The first thoughts I had when we sat down were that I liked the vibe of the restaurant and that the menu was too overwhelming. There are lots and lots of pizza options on the menu, not only with a variety of topping choices but different types of pizza (New York, Italian, Chicago, Detroit, Sicilian, etc.). My friends and I finally decided on an order of garlic bread and a The Vedura Classic Italian Pizza. The garlic bread came out first and was delicious! I appreciated that while the top of the garlic bread was nice and crispy, the bread itself was still soft. It also had cheese on it (automatic win). A little while later our pizza came out. The pizza was a good size for sharing and covered in delicious toppings. They also had spicy oil on the table, which tasted delicious on our pizza and garlic bread. All in all I really enjoyed our experience at Pizza Rock and would return the next time I'm in downtown Las Vegas!  Food - 4.5 stars Price - 4 stars Service - 4 stars Atmosphere - 4 stars",

    "text": "Seriously AMAZING pizza and I would have given 5 stars if there wasn't a stupid issue with our bartender.   It doesn't get much in Vegas for gourmet pizza though; always fresh and super creative pizza styles! I have tried many of their pizza's but currently my fav is the Vedura veggie pizza, something about it is incredible. Another good one that is award winning- Cali Itlia, super unique pizza and tasty. If you really want to step outside the box- try the one with quail eggs, it is actually pretty good.   Our issue: We put in an order for two pizzas (at the bar on a Tuesday non-busy evening) and 15-20mins later the bartender walks up and says \"Oh guys, I totally forgot to put your order in..what were the pizza's again?\" Ok..these things happen, not a huge deal as long as you do something to make up for it..I don't know- free bread or salad or a discount or something? NOTHING...I was pretty surprised by the fact that she did nothing to make up for the situation and obviously this had to reflect in her tip (we are very good tippers).  Besides that, we always get service at Pizza Rock but typically go to the GVR location.  Another example of the fact that service usually gets better further away from the strip and/or touristy areas..  UPDATE- 8/03/2016  Went into this Pizza Rock location last night. Enjoyed three of our fave pizzas and some beer, and with the same bartender but this time she was great (: no complaints at all. I am always craving Pizza Rock and encouraging newbies to try it out.  Cheers to the best pizza in Vegas!",

They have some humorous decors through the restaurant and even at the bathroom.  The place was well maintained with clean dining area.  We started some garlic breads, the seasoning was ok, but the bread was bit stale, probably because it was almost time to close?  For pizza, we got the Cali Italia and Downtown, the Cali looked interesting with a swirl of sauce on top, but it tasted a bit strange with a sweet taste that takes away from the vast savoriness below.  The Downtown looked like a mess when it first arrived.  Flavor was a bit with an overwhelming tomato and sauces in it.  I do not believe we finished either of the pizza  Perhaps the pizzas from Pizza Rock were meant to be consumed after you have been heavily intoxicated, or maybe we just came a bit late at night for the chefs to care what was being sent out.",

We ordered pizzas by the slice, and took them back to a table where we ordered alcohol from a waiter. The pizza was NY style, thin crust that held up to the gooey portion of cheese. We came in close to their closing time so the place wasn't very full and our waiter was super attentive with getting us drinks and water refills. Some of us definitely needed that water so it was much appreciated. Their pizza menu for full size pizzas is so extensive, you'll rarely find so many options. Check it out for yourself!",

    "text": "Our visit got off to a rough start.  I called to make reservations because we were coming with 5 adults and 2 babies in strollers.  We knew the strollers are sometimes an issue due to spacing of the tables, which was the main reason we called ahead.  The girl I spoke with put me on hold to check with someone about space for strollers and confirmed that they had a table for us that would have more than enough room.    Fast forward to our reservation time.  I check in at 6:25 for our 6:30 reservation and was told it would just be a minute.  We wait and wait and wait.  15 min has gone by, and we see other people walk in and get seated right away.  I go up to ask how much longer our wait would be and the girl who I originally checked in with asks - \"do you have a reservation?\"  Are you kidding?! I already told you we did 15 min ago!  We have been sitting and waiting this whole time right in front of you!  I tell her - yes, 5 adults and 2 strollers for a 6:30 reservation.  She says there's no tables that can accommodate strollers, her reservations just says 5 adults and 2 babies.  What?!  Apparently she assumed they would be sitting in high chairs not strollers.  I explained that we called ahead specifically about the strollers.  Instead of apologizing for the mixup, she rudely tries to show me her iPad to prove she's right and her reservation doesn't specify strollers.  I believe you, the person taking the reservation screwed up...fine! But what are you going to do to make this right? By now we have been waiting 20 min past our reservation.  She tells us we can sit at a tall bar top table.  With the strollers?  That doesn't work.  We see multiple long empty tables, but we're told they're reserved for other reservations.  Finally she walks away...presumably she was tired of dealing with us.  So we find who we believe to be the manager and he finally finds us a table.    Look, I get it.  This probably wasn't the best place to bring 2 babies in strollers. We know that now. But we were visiting from out of town and didn't realize the vibe of this place.  But the fact that we called ahead to make specific reservations, then be treated so rudely by the girl at the front desk with long black curly hair is unacceptable.  I wish I had gotten her name, but I didn't.  The only reason we didn't leave right then and there was it was a Saturday night and we probably wouldn't find another restaurant with a short wait time, and we were hungry!   Our waiter was just ok service wise.  The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 was because we enjoyed the food.  The artichoke appetizer was delicious, as were the pizzas we got (I believe it was the St Anthony and Stout pizzas).    Would we come back? Hell no!!  The pizzas were good, the service was HORRENDOUS.  Not worth the trouble in my opinion.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock is my go to if I want pizza at a sit down restaurant!  I've been here numerous times over the past few years and have always walked away full and satisfied.  I've been with both larger and smaller groups and the staff is always accommodating and attentive.  If you plan on going on a weekend night, I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid a wait.  They have a decent beer selection and they make a good moscow mule ($11) too.  On the weekends this place can get a little loud with the music (sometimes they have live music too) and is loud just with the sheer amount of customers coming through so just be aware of that.         Top Favorite Dishes: -The New Yorker ($25) - 16\" crust, your basic pepperoni and sausage pizza amped up, comes with three different types of cheeses, the ricotta cheese adds a sweetness to the pizza that surprisingly works well with the other ingredients, I get filled up on 1-2 slices so I usually share this with one other person -Classic Meatballs (6 for $9) - covered with marinara sauce in a balsamic vinegar reduction, great starter to kick off the meal   I've also had the Americano Pizza ($21) which was decent but too much toppings for me personally.  The La Regina ($32) is also really good but I don't usually get it because it is quite large and feeds 3-5 people alone.  Overall, I really like Pizza Rock and will continue to come back!",

We've been here 3 times for happy hour we sat in the bar area and the service was not that great almost every time we waited over 10 min just for someone to acknowledge us. But the food is amazing every time, so good that I couldn't knock even 1 star off for the somewhat slow service. I always get the meatballs for $4 the sauce is to die for and my boyfriend gets the personal pepperoni pizza for $5 and he also said it was good. Beers on tap are $2 off and well drinks are $4 I believe. We leave satisfied every time and our bill is always under $30 for food and a few drinks can't beat that. I also love that their happy hour is every day, not just week days. They have it from 3-6pm and a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm till close.",

    "text": "AMAZING pizza! We got a Sicilian pizza, The Boss, and it was like a supreme pizza on steroids. It was huge and can definitely easily feed 5 or more people depending on how hungry everyone is. Absolutely delicious.  We went on a Friday night so they were pretty busy. I went with a group of 8 and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. One side of the table ordered The Boss and the other side of the table ordered like a thin crusted pepperoni with mozzarella. Their pizza came out at least 15 minutes before ours... I would have preferred them coming out at the same time. Our pizza was ginormous and SO good though that it was well worth the wait.   Pizza Rock has a great atmosphere too! They had this large random front end of a truck in the restaurant and there was a DJ in the driver's seat playing music all night. He was playing some great throwbacks so we were very entertained while waiting for our pizza.   I checked in on yelp at got 15% off the bill for us! Our server was nice and was more than happy to apply the discount. The drinks were part of happy hour so it didn't discount from that but it saved us some money on our pizza. Love yelp check in specials!!   I'll definitely be back and will recommend this place for some bomb pizza. Awesome place Downtown!",

He told us about how Pizza Rock had award winning pizza and we had to try it. The pizza did not disappoint. It was really good and went well with the garlic bread. The wait staff was wonderful. We had questions about how much food to order since some pizzas served 6 and we were a party of 2. The pizza + garlic bread was just enough food. I highly recommend this place if you are in the Fremont Street area.",

So, he has been raving to me about it for some time now but the one time we tried to go we arrived as they closed.  Boo!  Finally luck shined upon me and we went there last night with some out-of-town friends.  I actually had no idea there was an entire restaurant area back there - all I'd ever passed was the little pick-up window with slices.  We were seated within a few minutes of arrival and I dig the decor. Dark with a rock, Italian flare.  Sounds strange, but they do it well.  I ordered the 3 meatballs for an appetizer and they were some of the best darn meatballs I've ever had.  They were rich with flavor, didn't fall apart and were actually quite filling.  My meal was the Artichoke Joe - holy cow. Every single ingredient by itself was good, then it was placed on this magnificent pie and baked.  The roasted artichoke is so tender and juicy, the sauteed spinach has a wonderful flavor without being mushy or overpowering and the Creme di parmigiana was an interesting but delicious surprise. This is probably one of my favorite pizzas ever.  I had some leftovers reheated in the oven tonight and it was still just as good.  Cowabunga, dude.  Can't wait until my next visit so I can sample some other delicious items.  -:3",

    "text": "Overall, the experience was good. We ordered the Rosemary Garlic Fries for our appetizer, which were excellent. Lots of garlic on them, so get ready for some taste. For our main course we ordered the Margarito Oven cooked pizza. We added sausage because it needed some meat. It was thin slices and smothered in sauce. Tasted fantastic, not your average taste. It was six slices, I split this with my boyfriend. We were still a little hungry afterwards, but for lunch it definitely hit the spot. We were checking out other people's meals as well and there was such a variety of sizes and styles. The layout of the restaurant was very nice, good for groups, private tables, bar, outdoor seating and regular seating. If you're I a hurry they do it by the slice too! The bathrooms were clean and smelled great, the signs for them made us laugh a little. Last the service was good. Our server Lisa was very sweet and since it was Our first time she was very patient with us. She was prompt and didn't over check on us. Pizza Rock is somewhere great to take the visiting family and a quick meal with friends or loved ones.",

I highly recommend you get here before everyone gets off work, because like any other downtown metor area, parking will be limited.    Ambiance is what you should expect, dark/dim lighting, loud music, and crowded.  Not too big of a deal because you will be so busy concentrating on demolishing your food any way.    We have only been here 2 times and we have yet to try so many options here.  There are so many different pizza combos to try, that you better bet we are coming back to eventually try it all.     The combinations of flavors that they put on their pizza is awesome.  Don't be afraid to add more protein...it might add that added Yum to your pizza.  Whats important to me when I eat a pizza, its the crispiness of the crust.  Thats exactly what you get, a nice crispy pizza.   This place is a must try!",

We didn't sit inside the restaurant, even though it was happy hour, because we were under a time crunch, so we sat at the pizza counter and got to watch them make pizza. We were \"dough eyed\" patrons hoping for a real NYC pizza experience and boy did we get it! The counter and pizza window were a great entry into the really nice restaurant area. The staff seemed friendly enough. We ordered 2 pepperoni and sausage slices that just seemed right. The slices were huge and had that wonderful authentic pizza aroma with not a lot of grease. The crust was thin yet chewy and held up to being picked up and eaten. The cheese held on and didn't slide off with a bite, the sauce was the right amount and fresh. Toppings were spread on evenly and the pepperoni had the crispy edges. We watched him make another pizza and carefully distributed the toppings evenly across while telling us the secret to their great pizza...semolina flour and imported Italian tomatoes.  Pizza Rock is proof that you don't have to go to NY for great pizza. So happy Pizza Rock will also be at Green Valley Ranch!",

Bottom line: This is an overpriced, and overpraised burger.  Compared to the less expensive, and infinitely better burgers at Fat Choy and Rollin' Smoke, the Pizza Rock burger is a non-starter.

I received several refills on my soda but my friend wasn't ever asked if she wanted another beer.  Very loud inside with ballgames on various TV's, music videos blaring on other TV's.  Hard to even hold a conversation  at our own table.  A bit pricey in my opinion.  We had a 10\" Margherita pizza, garlic bread appetizer, a soda and a beer.  Total was $37, without tip.",

We decided to wait for the fries before we started and after waiting 10 minutes and no one checking up on us we decided to start eating. A waiter passed by us and we were going to ask him for a refill and our fries but he walked right past us and left to go flirt with the hostess up front. They stayed their talking while we tried to get his attention and once he finished his conversation we called him but he walked right past us again. Finally the waitress came to refill our drink and we let her know about our fries, she said she had forgotten and she'd bring them out quickly. Well it seemed that the priority of that chef was to make them fast and not good. They smelled so strong of garlic and tasted terrible we ate three before getting grossed out. I don't think it's worth coming out here.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, my procrastination (which apparently extended into the holiday season) overtook my ability to complete this review from my trip 3 months ago.  Please excuse the tardiness.  ROCK on! This restaurant was recommended by the friends (Hawaii transplants) I had planned to meet in Vegas during my October trip.  I asked if they wouldn't mind meeting in DTLV, and without any whatsoever hesitation they suggested Pizza Rock.    NOTE: Reservation secured via Open Table.  SETTING: Its very ROCK n' Roll...ish.  The decor is dark (black plays a prominent role) yet simple.  The exposed brick, eclectic chandeliers, and full size semi truck add a touch of uniqueness to the space.  Seating is at various tables or at the bar.  The stick figure signs near the bathroom entrances are quite humorous.  FOOD: The menu seemed a bit overwhelming at first:  appetizers, salads, pizza (Classic American to Italian, there's something for everyone), pasta and Italian dinners, burgers and sandwiches, calzone, etc.    Of course, we came for pizza, so most of us chose pizza (3 out of 4 in our group).  The lone female decided to order the Chicken Parmigiana.  I chose the Americano Pizza and it was just amazing.  I was fearful that the crust would break under all the weight of the toppings.  The tomatoes alone must have weighed a ton.  Thankfully, the crust stood firm.  Of course, I didn't finish it in one sitting.  One wouldn't dream of consuming that much food at one time.  Unless one was hungry enough to accomplish such a feat.  Alas, I wasn't that hungry and it was so much food.  Generous portion surely.  In the end, we all left very full and very satisfied.  SERVICE: Very good!  I commend our server with being so patient with our group.  The tourists....I mean visitors, in our group (namely me) took a bit longer to decide.  She answered all our questions, and periodically checked on  us throughout the evening.    BOTTOM LINE: I left a pizza of my heart in LV.  You rock, Pizza Rock!",

    "text": "Just too expensive for what it is.  Wanting to support a local place rather than a chain, we ordered pizza delivered from Pizza Rock today. When it arrived, I was very sadly surprised to see how small it was.  Yes, it said 13\" on the menu, but... wow, that's a small pizza. Pretty much four average-size slices.  And here's the thing; with two sides, $2 for delivery, and a $6 tip, it came to OVER $50. As it turns out, we couldn't feed 4 people for that price. Our Fried Artichoke Heart app had only 4 pieces. That's one piece per person at almost $2.25 per piece! Yikes!  [Weird aside here; Our pizza was cut very irregularly - with several very very small slices, and a couple of very very large slices - making dividing it up between four friends awkward. Yes, we know how to use a knife, and figured it out - but again, for the price??? Some Quality Control, please]   So, We wound up ordering more food from a chain and got twice as much food for literally half the price.   I appreciate the quality, but I can't afford to do that again - and that makes me sad.   Enjoy your pizza, rich folks.",

We were starving from traveling and our cab driver suggested this place- there is a sit down restaurant or up front you can buy pizza by the slice and sit at the counter to eat or take it to-go.  As much as I wanted to sit down and have a drink, we had like 15mins so we ordered up front and ate there. The 2 guys making the pizzas were hilarious and fun to talk with. I'm not sure if they were just making the pizzas for up front or for the restaurant too (I didn't see an order screen or anything). I was talking about how fresh and wonderful the New York style pizza was and how at a place in NJ they would have shakers of garlic. I said \"man that would be perfect right now\" as I only saw cheese and red pepper shakers. Next thing I know he is passing me a serving of garlic \"sprinkles\". I was in heaven! I still dream of that pizza. Next time I am in Vegas I am going back but making sure I do sit-down service so I can get my fair share (and maybe some to go!)",

They also have American versions ifthat is your taste. They also have gluten free options which was helpful for one of the people in our party.  Service was excellent and he kept coming back to refill drinks without even asking. I love it when that happens!  The location is right off of Fremont St. The vibe was super cool inside with vinyl records incorporated into the menu. I would love to go back again on our next trip to Vegas!",

It had a really strong smokey taste which wore on me - not because it was a specialty piece, it was just from the oven. And It wasn't from me because I hadn't been smoking ANYTHING in LV :)  The Detroit was remarkable! It's a deeper dish pizza and they run out of this later in the day. You'll taste why. The pieces are generously sized and they'll even add more sauce for you. The extra cheese burns around the edges giving it an even better tasting crust and a crunch. I'll definitely be back!",

We then had re New Yorker Pizza which is cooked in a brick oven to order and was hot and tasty. They also have a wide variety of salads and other Italian food items for almost every appetite.   If In a hurry, you can also get pizza by the slice as well which is a nice option for folks on the move   Service was great and everyone was friendly from start to finish.

    "text": "We saw this featured on a show on the Food Network so we actively searched out this place when we were in Vegas since we love pizza.  We went in at like 9pm on a Friday after the UNLV basketball game.    Service was super slow.  We waited a while for our drink order to be taken, it was not busy.  Drinks got ordered, and then a table of about 8 people came in and sat nearby, they were kind of plastered and the server got caught up dealing with them, so our food order took forever to get taken, therefore forever to be delivered.  We did get the late night happy hour, Vegas can be spendy!    Got the meatballs, and the Picante mini pizza.  I liked, fiancee is a pizza purist and didn't like the pizza that much, but he's from New York and super picky about pizza.    I ordered a drink...can't remember the name of it and I don't see it on the menu online.  But it was described basically as a Vodka Soda with some berries in it.  Was very very sweet and when he came to check on us, eventually, I ordered another and asked if it had simple syrup in it, because it was really sweet, for what it was listed as being.  He said yes, there is simple syrup in it.  I said, well...that's not listed there.    Not like they bought me the drink since it was made differently than it was listed.    Atmosphere is cool, we'd give it another try, the area is cool in downtown las vegas, and we like getting off the strip and trying new stuff.  The takeout pizza by the slice window is busy in the nighttime hours.    The simple syrup and the below average service were the only issues, but that can be easily remedied....make sure they make the drink without simple syrup or send it back immediately when I can tell it's not what I want...and sit at the bar for faster service probably?  It's worth giving it another shot to me, and we go to Vegas more than most people since my fiancee's daughter goes to UNLV.",

Pizza Rock sells killer slices. Had a slice (about a 1/4 of a pie) of pep, salami, and ricotta. I'd say that the hype about their crust is spot on. Might be the best crust I've ever eaten. The slice was not overdosed with toppings, hate that, it was a pleasure eating it.   Well done Pizza Rocks.   After I posted this review I did a search on maps to see what the name of the pizza place across the street from Original Joe's in SF was called. Closest thing to the pie at Pizza Rocks.

We ended up ordering cheese bread, some drinks and a pizza and the total ended up being $70 for the 4 of us. The pizza was really great and the drinks were okay. We got the pineapple fizz and the berry fizz.  Towards the end our waiter kind of disappeared and it took a long time to get the check, and then for him to take it once we were ready for payment. He had a hard time splitting it into two checks so we ended up having to just pay 50/50 on the check.  The lack of service towards the end is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but i would definitely come back next time i visit Fremont street.",

    "text": "After visits through the years...time to show some Yelp love...  Pizza Rock service:  The service has gotten better with every visit as it was hit or miss in my earlier visits.  My last visit was particularly good as both servers took care of a private party of 25 like pros.  The kitchen got our family sized servings of meatballs, calamari, salads and pizzas out in a timely manner.  Drinks were kept fresh for our big group.  fantastic..  Pizza Rock cuisine:  Salads have always been fresh.  The calamari and meatballs are great openers if you're feeling really hungry for pizza.  Heavy in taste and flavor.   My favorite pizza is the New Yorker: sliced mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, Garlic, oregano, ricotta, etc Lots of meat and cheese on a thinner crust slays it for me.  All the other pizzas I've sampled have been consistently tasty because of the high quality ingredients used in the cheese, meat and crust.    Pizza Rock ambiance: Industrial decor, brick walls and an 18 wheeler truck in the main dining area.  The tables are on the bigger side in order to accommodate the big pizzas that get delivered to your table.  You can order pizzas by the slice to go at the entrance.  Additionally, there's a back bar fully stocked with TVs which makes it a great place to watch sports.  This is one of my go to places when I'm fiending some tasty pizza.  The parking situation makes dining there a little inconvenient but if you're in the downtown area it's definitely worth a visit.  On the next visit, I might make a run at their calzones but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

We had a great local tap while we waited on our pizza.  Pizza was oh so yummy!  Crust was perfectly cooked--not burnt, but crispy.  We had pepperoni, caramelized onion, and Serrano peppers.  Oh those peppers were spicy and delicious!  The pizza was big enough for two of us to share!  Great atmosphere and pizza! I highly recommend stopping in when you are on Fremont!",

At her suggestion,  waited at the bar for a table to \"open up\", even though we had reservations. I'm guessing the restaurant seats 150? Maybe 8 people were there. Literally.  10 minutes to be acknowledged by bartender. Ordered 1 glass of sangria,  not very good, over $9.00. I'm not sure if the food is good or not, see couldn't take the unprofessional atmosphere any longer and left, once the hostess finally came to get us for our table, in an almost empty restaurant.  Terrible experience,  shame on you.",

We stopped to eat here before doing the walk.  It wasn't too busy the restaurant seemed like it was pretty full but we were able to be seated right away and this was during dinner hour. Got our waters quickly. Ordered calamari first. It was pretty good. Nothing too crazy, they had a marinara sauce and some spicy aioli type of sauce. It had a good kick.   We decided to share the New Yorker. It had sausage and pepperoni and chunks of ricotta cheese on top which was amazing. But other than the ricotta cheese the pizza itself wasn't anything special. I really thought it was going to be amazing. Maybe next time I will get a different pizza. The New Yorker was a award winning pizza though but I didn't feel like it was.",

We had the fries with rosemary garlic ($4) and the cal italia personal pizza ($7).  Both were very good, though the pizza could have used better distribution of the toppings.  The personal pizza is small to share but not horrible for a single person if you couple it with a few beers.  At Happy Hour, $2 off beers and wines which makes the prices much more-reasonable.   Plenty of TVs make Pizza Rock perfect for viewing.  Staff is friendly but gets lost a lot.  We will see our waiter constantly, then it'll be 15 minutes before we have contact again (and we were sitting at the bar).  Overall, I liked Pizza Rock for a downtown destination.  Being the frst time I've dined in, I don't have any complaints, especially cornering Happy Hour.  I would recommend to all.",

But at happy hour you have your choice of three and each is only $7. My dad and I shared one and an order of Gorgonzola fries and it was the perfect amount. I would note that the fries are not only topped with Gorgonzola crumbles, but also an excessive amount of a Gorgonzola sauce. Yum!  This place is huge which gives you plenty of space to spread out at happy hour and hopefully not too long of a wait on a busy night. The decorations are super fun - rock and Roll memorabilia, Marilyn wallpaper in the bathroom, menus that are on the inside of record cases (note: the Happy Hour Menu is on the record itself. Also, service is friendly!",

They had a pretty sparse selection of pizzas at the counter so I asked what they had, as a first timer simply looking at the pizzas it was not obvious which each one was. The smart ass employee told me \"we have all of these\" and waved his arm toward the counter.   There were a half dozen employees behind the small counter, it was like watching the 6 stooges. They were dropping pizza dough on the ground, slapping each other with the pizza paddles, yelling, goofing off, etc. At one point they even caught a bunch of the pizzas in the oven on fire. What a bunch of dopes.",

    "text": "After seeing Dave Portnoy devour a slice of cheese pizza on his Barstool review, I knew I had to try! We tried the pepperoni and the cheese pizza. The pepperoni was ok, but the cheese was even better. Dave's rating of 7.3 may have been a little bit low. So far, this is my favorite pizza in Vegas that I have tried. Everyone likes to talk up Secret pizza in Cosmo like its some kind of hidden gem. But that pizza is highly overrated and popular due to accessibility on the strip. If you're looking for a decent slice of pizza, stop by Fremont and give Pizza Rock a try. The cheese is cheesy and the crust is light and flaky.",

Because unbeknownst to me, we had just happened upon  one of Tony Gemignani's restaurants.   IMHO he makes the best pizza on earth. I can attest, I've been to Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco many times and it's bona fide pizza heaven.    Pizza Rock is conveniently located across from the Downtown Grand Hotel. Our server was attentive but not hovering and it was a fun vibe too.  Menus are crafted from album covers for Pete's sake!  We hung out at happy hour which made this an even better deal, I'd have been completely satisfied paying full price.    Rosemary Garlic Italian Fries and Fried Green Beans were a sold start.  Classic Meatballs were as drool-worthy as they are in Tony's San Francisco spot.  Then the Cal Italia arrived...a blend of cheeses including gorgonzola, prosciutto, a sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction.  Seriously, I'm salivating thinking about it.",

My friend and I went around 9 pm on a Friday night and it was packed but we didn't wait for more than 5 minutes to get a table.  The service wasn't the best but I get it- the waiters were slammed! Every table was full!  We asked our waitress for her recommendation and she said the pepperoni crispy crust square cut 16\" (I forget the name :( Brooklyn style maybe?). We also got the fried artichokes as an appetizer.  AMAZING! The fried artichokes were brilliant, sauce exquisite. The pizza? Oy vey! I don't think my friend and I spoke a single word to each other until the pizza was half gone. We got a takeaway box and it was still good cold the next day.  If you appreciate good pizza, this is where it's at! Also, prices were good - especially for Vegas. We got out of there for under $40 for 2 people. We didn't have alcohol but sodas, an app, and a pizza !",

My waitress seriously made me feel like I was bothering her when asking for something. On top of that, the wait for everything was RIDICULOUS. It wasn't even packed. We had to hunt down our waitress multiple times. We came for bottomless mimosas but left paying $45 for a large salad and bottomless orange juice. If you go bottomless, get the sangria. It's worth it. We never had a chance to eat our pizza because the order was put in wrong and it wasn't worth us waiting another 45 minutes for a new one. Not worth it. Won't be back and won't suggest this place to friends while visiting Vegas.",

Don't be snippy at the customer when he points out the open tables and you get short with the customer and tell him he has 30-40 more minute wait then seat him 5 minutes later at a table he just told you was open!

I think our waiters name was Eric - HE WAS AWESOME! They have a number of different pizzas, but I wanted to get the Tony Tony or Tony 2 Times (something like that) which is a personal pan pizza that is only offered during happy hour. So we decided upon Rosemary Garlic fries and the Butcher Pizza. I am so glad that I took my blood pressure pill because that pizza had a lot of piggy on it. It was good, just didn't have enough mozzarella on the bottom for my liking. Good food, great service, clean atmosphere and an even cleaner restroom...solid 4 stars in my book.",

Usually my go-to pizza spot in LV is Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, but I now have an off strip favorite!  You can dine in, but there is also a cute little walk up window which works really great for late night. There are tables and chairs outside along a brightly lit side walk. It is connected to Downtown Grand, so it is definitely convenient for those staying at the hotel, but street accessible for those who are just passing by.  We ordered pepporoni, our favorite. It was delicious! Quality ingredients and a pefectly crisp crust! Definitely a must if you are in the downtown area.",

And ask for box and check, another 15 mins..... really? It wasn't busy at the night, don't know how the server manage takes that long to do one single task. Also, body bussing the table, all empty glasses and dishes just pile up on the table until we have to place them on the next table. Doesn't look like under staffed but slow service like this just below my mind that why would I come back again, there are others new restraint for me to try.

This is probably the best pizza I've had...ever. The crust is perfectly thin and crispy. The sauce is by far the best part. It's so simple yet complex.

They are a bit on the pricey side and service can be spotty, but the food is always on point and delivered hot and fresh to your table. The interior is pretty cool, it is large and open, there is even a semi-truck on the inside!  I'm a big fan of the Old Chicago pizza, the meatballs are delicious and the fresh ricotta is creamy and melts in your mouth. The Cal-Italia is an interesting choice if you are in the mood for something a bit sweet. All of the ingredients work really well together, despite sounding a bit odd. I've also tried the Burrata burger and while it was a good burger I think that Burrata is too delicate to melt on a burger. It's a cheese that you need to eat alone to really appreciate the flavor. I've also had their meatball sub and while I wasn't a huge fan of the bun, the meatballs were flavorful and delicious. The rosemary and sea salt garlic fries are a pretty good side as well.  They also have a counter right inside the door where you can grab a quick slice. I've spent many lunch breaks perched at the counter with a slice. Again, it's a bit pricey, but the slices are huge and you can try a variety of toppings.   I think that Pizza Rock is a great addition to downtown. It's great for big groups and it's nice to have an artisan pizza restaurant within walking distance from work.",

    "text": "Bumped up from 4- to 5-stars. This place serves great pizza, has a nice beer selection, an energetic atmosphere, and servers who take ownership and are helpful in making selections.  So, after two visits with several friends, here are my updated thoughts.  Classic Meatballs - moist, tender, and flavorful. A nice start to a meal if you are unsure how many pizzas to order (e.g. should we order 2 or 3 pizzas for the group). Using this example, I would order a large order of meatballs and 2 pizzas.  Beer Battered Artichokes - This depends on if you like artichokes (duh). Batter is light and the artichoke hearts are tender. I am a fan.  Pizza - What to order, what to order.  My favorite is the Cal Italia. Now, if you are looking for a traditional pizza, do not order this.  However, if you have an open mind and are looking for something a bit different, this is a good choice. If you are a traditionalist, go with the New Yorker. The crust has difficulty holding the ingredients, so might have to use a fork to cut & eat (I know, I know, Dante has some lower level of Hell for those who eat pizza with anything other than their hands). But well worth breaking generations of pizza-eating tradition to enjoy each bite. In particular the fennel sausage has just the right flavor to make the pizza interesting.  So, if visiting Vegas, take an hour or so, get off the Strip and enjoy a local favorite.  If a local, you should consider making Pizza Rock a regular part of your restaurant rotation.  Enjoy!",

We did not enjoy that. I must say, regular tables were still available. We were not asked if we are ok with that. As soon we sat down, I'm looking at those small plates sitting on our table, 2 stets of 4, the top ones were dirty, but that was not all, litterly every single plate of those 8 were dirty. Either we still had the ones from the previous customers sitting there for us to use, or they just do a darn bad job in cleaning them.  The waiter promised a real Italien pizza, ok heard that a lot of times in this town.  Pizza comes out and the dissapointed to is huge. Way to soggy in the middle and the whole pizza has way to much pizza sauce on it. I know how a pizza has to be, I learned in Italy and been in Europe for 33 years.  I will not return to this place, for a soggy pizza that cost a fortune. Some people never leave this country and they just buy anything a waiter/company says.",

I am so over the Las Vegas Buffets so when I saw a Living Social Deal for this place, I scooped it up.  It was 29.00 for any antipasta, any pizza( except the 33.00 NY pizza) and one beer.  I had an additional living social coupon so I paid 24.00.  We also don't drink so we got a soda instead.  We also got a Caesar salad( 10.00) instead of an antipasta.  That was no problem.  My wife is from Milwaukee, the home of the best cracker crust pizza, so that's what we ordered.  It was a very thin crust pizza, but I wouldn't call it a cracker crust.  It didn't have that \"snap\" that a cracker crust has.  Nevertheless, it was a good pizza and so large.  We took a lot of it home.  The cracker crust pizza is cut always cut in squares.   I really love the concept, numerous different styles of pizza at one restaurant.  Next time, I'm going to try the margarita and the NY pizza.",

We started off with some house salad, and gorgonzola and apple they were good But the Gorgonzola fries WOW!!!!!! Rosemary and Garlic Fries!!! Even my 3 year old loved them! Great for sharing and nibbling before the pizza gets here!   Now for the Main event! The Pizza   We stuck to the classic half pep half cheese and that blew our taste buds away the others must be Amazing and cannot wait to come back to try the rest! I would drive all the way here from Centennial to get this pizza... It's that good!   They have thick and thin pizza!   The sauce is so flavorful, you can taste the time that went into this. The cheese bubbly, fresh, hot! The dough crispy yummy! Sooooooooo good!   Service is great and detailed!   Gelato is a perfect sweet ending to this flavorful meal!    We will be back and will be spreading the word!",

The portion of fries is huge so you can easily share with five people as an appetizer.  I had the Margherita and New York pizza. Both were delicious! The Margherita's crust was so thin and yummy, I think it's my favorite.  Right now they have a yelp offer for check ins. I believe it's 10% off for locals even though it says 15% off.",

Nice crisp crust. Perfect chew. Sausage delicious and great pepperoni. Sauce is nice too. Washed it all down with a couple of beers on tap. Great service. A tad high on prices.

The total for this portion of our bill was $54!    When we walked in, this place had a nice vibe. The music was a great selection and it was the perfect volume.  We were sat near the bar, but asked to move, so we didn't have to sit on bar stool level table and chairs.  They were very accommodating and moved us no problem.   Of course we all ordered beers.  They have a nice selection of drafts, and an even bigger selection of bottles.   We ordered the SALUMI & FORMAGGIO BOARD for our appetizer. The menu describes it as - Assorted Salumi & Formaggio, Fig Jam, Spicy Candied Walnuts, Rosemary Focaccia Toast.  It was very good and is a nice bite for 2-4 people. Unfortunately, we were so hungry, I forgot to get a picture of it. :P  Then for the pizza, we decided to get our money's worth of the coupon I had and ordered the biggest pizza we could.  LOL!  We chose the Romano II. It was divided into three section with three different toppings. All three were delicious!  The pizza was thin and crispy and there were plenty of toppings and cheese.  Here's how the menu describes it...section 1: Tomato Sauce, Natural Casing Pepperoni, Italian Sausage; section 2: Pesto, Caramelized Onions, Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Garlic; section 3: Ricotta, Garlic, Basil, Linguisa, Piquante Peppers Section 1 was perfect for that typical man \"meat lovers\" pizza. Section 2 was unique with the sweetness of the Caramelized onions and saltiness of the goat cheese.  Section 3 was my favorite, even though I think they forgot the ricotta. I loved the sweetness of the Piquante Peppers (like a roasted red pepper), and the Linguisa is very similar to their pepperoni.   During our meal the GM came over and asked us how we were enjoying it and even told us all about the business, from the encouragement of my Aussie friend.   Would definitely go back and will!!!",

Both pies were perfect in every way and must say you are my fav pizza place in the US. I've eaten at the best on the east coast and Arizona and this place puts them all away. Also they perfect every style of pie you can imagine from NY street style to sicilia! ! will come back tomorrow!  :D",

Especially on Fri and Sat nights, they have a DJ that plays videos on the TV screens and he plays music mash ups and funny movie clips. So great.  Now on to the food. We had to order a pizza, obviously. We ordered a Sicilian style Peperoni pizza with the thicker crust and it was perfect. Cooked just right with plenty of cheese and serves up to 5 people! We had 4 in our party and had so much left over so I think it could prob feed more depending on how many slices each one has. Our server wasn't too bad. But, she wasn't the greatest either. There was times that our salad plates were left on our table a little too long and we couldn't fit the pizza and the other plates so kind of annoying.  But, other than that, I loved this place! Great vibe and great for the downtown area (right next to Fremont Street). Definitely recommend.  Oh yeah, and there is also a pick up window too in the front if you don't want to eat in the restaurant :)",

    "text": "Eh...it was fine.  We were hanging out watching the band outside the Downtown Grand and watched 395898 people get pizza here. I knew I remembered the name from Yelp and that it had pretty good reviews, so we decided to get a slice before heading up to our room.  We stood in the Take Out line, 3 people in front of us and it took a really, really long time. However, the guy inside was seriously hustling, so it wasn't a lazy thing, more a ton of people eating inside thing. I really wanted a basic slice of cheese, but they were out so I went with pepperoni.  Like I said above, eh..I thought it was a little too greasy, and nothing to write home about. I ate about a quarter and called it good. I think I would have liked the cheese better, but it's hard to say. Would I eat it again? Maybe, if it was late and there wasn't really anything else open. It was cheap, $3.75, so it had that going for it.   I will say they had other, more interesting pizzas like a California and purple potato, so maybe those would have been better choices, but I think that maybe this place just isn't my cup of tea. I would say it is probably worth checking out and forming your own opinion though because between the 4-5 star reviews and how busy it was, a lot of people would disagree with my opinion on the place.",

For a couple of the employees...smiles must cost extra. Seriously, you say? Yes, I am sad to report that of the many times that I have been to Pizza Rock for a delicious slice of thin or think crust, there are employees that refuse to smile. I work nearby, so when I discovered the pizza here was sold by the slice and it was only about $4 a slice, I was in carb heaven! I may have to go up a dress size, but my taste buds are not suffering at all. I enjoy every amazing bite. I preach about this pizza at work. I bring coworkers here, people I have only said hello to, people that I see in the breakroom at work. I say Go... eat at Pizza Rock. Brave the heat and take a walk down the block. It is worth a little sunburn on your nose. BUT, do not expect a smile. I give them the heads up. Close your eyes, look away and just point at the pizza.  Unless Ryan is working. Ryan is awesome. He chats while making the pizzas and makes us feel comfortable and we have a few laughs with him. Ryan is cool. Others might need a smile seminar or something. Makes a difference managers... well, maybe in the case of Pizza Rock and myself, it doesn't. I will just not expect anything else but great pizza. Get the Sicilian pizza. Everyone I have taken here loves it.   Enjoy! Just the pizza, because smiles cost extra.",

After a text message that our table was ready we were quickly seated and found the service friendly and professional. The house salad was very good and we ordered the Margherita pizza. The pizza looked great and the sauce and cheese were very good. Unfortunately whoever baked the pie burnt the crust. I don't mean they toasted it; there was an overwhelming charred flavor that really ruined the pizza. This was a major disappointments and all of my hope disappeared that this would replicate Don Antonio's in NYC.  I would not order a Neapolitan pizza from this place in the future but I would try one of their other options as their menu is very extensive.",

Drinks coming from the bar were slow, food delivery was slow.....the salad was so slow in coming that it came with the pizza (with the wrong dressing) and we sent it back.

No greeting, no hello, no smile, just a blank face \"how many?\" I said there was going to be 4 for dinner. I was told it would be a 30-40 min wait and I was fine with that since it is Saturday. Our friends en route told us they were 3 instead of 2 so I told the hostess that we were going to be 5. She asked if we'd be fine at a high top table. I told her only if it was a full sized table we could comfortably have our food and drinks. She asked if we could put a chair on the end of a 4 top and I said no. I don't want to be so cramped that we cant enjoy ourselves. She said that with 5 it would then be an additional 15 min. fine. I went to the bar. no smiles there either. The bartender asked what I wanted and I asked for a water and a coke. He said he had a lot going on and would get to it when he could. Seemed weird but again, fine. After the promised wait the hostess comes up to me and say's \"You can follow me\" so we did and she takes us to a 4 seat small hightop with a fifth chair stuck on the end. It is exactly what we specifically said we did not want. BTW, we saw 3 large tables on the way to it. It was crowded with just our menus and there was no way 5 men, some of us 6'5\", all of us big could eat a few large pizzas and have drinks etc. My husband spoke to the manager who basically said there was nothing she could do and that they seat 5 people there just fine all the time. The manager was rude and condescending in tone, couldn't care less about what we wanted. Had they told us that they can't accommodate our request, I'd have been fine with that. We could have just left, gone somewhere else. They waisted our time and were rude and defensive about it. All 5 of us will never return to either location.",

Who can't get down to some awesome 80's pop/rock to some of today's pop hits like Bruno Mars and the like while laughing at the bewildering videography concepts?! SPizza here is to die for! It's definitely all in the crust. You have to have mastered the crust for a pizza to be so delicious! Being a vegetarian I ordered the zucchini fried which I HIGHLY recommend! They had a nice, thick breaded crust which was perfectly fried: crisp crunch on the outside and a nice soft inside. They came with a side of some tasty spicy sauce and they were delicious! My friend had the meatballs, 3 large sauce covered balls of meat, and he loved them! For our pizza choices I decided to veer off the \"award winning\" recommendation of their margherita once I saw a little thing called the Honey Pig listed below it on the menu. Glad I did! It came with a honey glaze, cheese, poblano peppers and caramelized onions on top. Diverse and delicious! My friend chose the Sausage and Stout Pizza and not being a big sausage lover (no pun intended! ) he still loves this pizza and orders it (almost) every time. We ordered the mud pie for dessert but it was a little too frozen to fully enjoy but came as a good size portion. Overall, this place is a win and I definitely recommend it if you find yourself downtown and looking for a great pizza!",

At 7:00pm on Saturday, it was full, but really not too busy because staff was congregating and chatting in the back service station. There was only one roll up setting when seated, then food delivered without the servers noticing only one person had a napkin & silverware. Empty glasses not cleared from the table. Trash on the floors. The pail on the table that held the one clean napkin roll up was dirty on the inside with drips of dried sticky sauce. Both the men's & women's restroom needed critical maintenance. There was no DJ that we could see on Saturday night like as advertised on your website.",

Like a thin crust large enough to roll up with amazing sauce and toppings? Order the New Yorker!! I'm picky as hell and I didn't have to ask to add this or ask for extra that-it's perfect as is. Great happy hour and the bartenders are knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. Ask for Alex-he knows his craft beers and the menu well!!",

The line can be long so make a reservation via phone or open table.  Since a Pizza Rock opened in Henderson, I head there because it's closer to my home. The Las Vegas location is also a great place with amazing food.  We've tried half of their pizzas and appetizers and you can't go wrong with any of it.   if you like spicy food the Picante is fab. You can always change it up a bit by replacing the hot sauce with the pizza sauce and have the jalapenos on the side.  The Napolese is the best ever! This is the pizza that was noted as one the top 50!! We order this a lot!",

I can do spicy foods, however I could only eat a few of these comfortably. The spice was maybe a bit too much. They were good though. We also ordered the Margarita pizza, as they advertise it is award winning. The pizza was good, but the crust was a little burnt on the edges, which you could actually taste so it wasn't that appealing. The middle was just a tad soggy.   Our server wasn't one of our faves. She didnt seem pleased when we came in to be seated and said table for 2. It wasn't busy, but my husband and I did notice she rolled her eyes??   Overall, I would definitely go back and try it again. There were other things on the menu I want to try.",

    "text": "We were in Downtown and wanted to try a new restaurant. I am so happy we found this on Yelp! Even though it is not on Fremont, it is only a quick walk from it. And quite frankly it's worth it since sadly a lot of the food options on Fremont is well... not so good.  We showed up on a Saturday evening and was seated shortly afterwards. The decor of this place is a feast for your eyes. I loved the cute pee-pee sign for the restroom! We were seated right next to a semi truck! There were lots of TVs for your viewing pleasure. LOVE the fact that on some of the TVs there were closed captioning. (I would like to know what's happening instead of watching a silent film, well in this case game.)  Our server, Tim C., was excellent! (He is part of the reason why this place is a 5 star!) We let him know that it was our first time there. He was very thorough in explaining on what was popular. During our meal he came back often to make sure our food was to our satisfaction and if we needed another beer.  As for the food, since we had pizza the night before we decided to have a non-pizza meal. (I know, who goes to a pizza join and not get pizza right?!) I ordered the Gorgonzola & Apple Salad. This hit the spot! Love the combination of the gorgonzola and apple with cranberries and walnuts. It was not heavy at all and it was very satisfying. I had a bite of my husband's Gorgonzola Burger. It was delicious! The patty was very juicy. And OMG can I say their fries that come with it is AMAZING! They use real garlic and they use a lot of it! Really puts some hair on your chest. Definitely don't be kissing anyone after that. But definitely eat it!  Looking forward to returning to this place and trying some of their pizzas!  PS. Use your 15% off your bill with Yelp check-in.",

The atmosphere was super-cool with the semi inside and our own little private table. The service was friendly; we encountered at least three different employees, all with exceptionally good attitudes. The pizza was divine! We ordered the award winning Margherita.

The host wouldn't even look at us. We said 2 please she looked at us and rolled her eyes and started rubbing lotion on her hands. She finally grab some menus and still not saying anything started walking away. We followed her to the table she put the menus down and said have a good day. Wow as someone in the food industry this is horrible service there was only 2 other tables in there so it's not like she had anything to do. Luckily the server Jeffrey came right over and greeted us and was very friendly so we didnt leave. We said something about th host must not like her job he said yeah shes just in a bad mood today. Well the management should teach their team members to leave personal issues at the door before they start walking out before even getting seated. We had green beans which were so good and fresh! The calzones were so big and good. We both couldn't even eat half of one! Jeffrey said its usually very busy there at night so if you don't want to wait go at lunch time. Hopefully they replace the host soon before they start loosing business",

    "text": "How deceiving is the decor in this place?   Pizza Rock on the inside gives off the Guy Fieri/ Affliction look. Over-the-top designs and trying really hard to be the cool \"rock-n-roll\" type place to eat pizza. I didn't really notice that much \"rocking\" decor except for in the bathroom, where an airbrushed Jimi Hendrix face stares at you while you do your business. Don't forget the giant Semi Truck with killer flames on it placed in the middle of the restaurant. Nothing says, \"Rock-N-Roll\" like a truck with flames bro.    That being said, the food here was actually very good. I arrived right before happy hour was ending and the bartender was cool enough to get in my food and double my beer order so I could get the happy hour prices. Great customer service move, plus she never rushed me and even gave pizza suggestions while I hungrily stared at the large menu. \"I'll have the Cal Italia Personal Pizza and the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA\". Mmmm, IPA.   Along with my order, I also got a Caesar Salad which was pretty basic minus the anchovies laid on top, yikes! Not my idea of appetizing, but \"when in Rome\" or \"Pizza Rock\" do as they do?...Naw...these were promptly picked off and placed on the side. The salad was very large and could easily have been a meal all on it's own or shared. Crisp lettuce, shaved parmesan, and garlic croutons, great foodie starting point. The pizzaI I ordered, The Cal Italia, is an award winning pie according to their menu, in fact it's a Gold Medal Winner from the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. How's that for a stamp of approval!  This pizza was very tasty from the three different types of cheeses, balsamic reduction, and sweet fig preserves. This crazy combination only got more delightful with the addition of thinly sliced Prosciutto di Parma, B-O-M-B. There were only four slices of this pizza, but I could have easily eaten eight. The beer just complimented my eating experience, thank goodness I had two in front of me.   The Guy Fieri style decor might turn-off your hunger, but as the old saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover, only by how tasty its pages are\". I might have made that last part up.",

    "text": "This review is after a one time visit  with my brother a couple of weeks ago after a 51's day game. We both enjoyed our experience and I intend to visit the location in Henderson which is closer to home so I can sample more of the menu.  We came mid afternoon after parking in the deck across the street. The hostess will validate your parking ticket upon departure. We went straight to the bar and were greeted immediately and given menus. Man, the menu is huge. My brother easily ended any indecisiveness by saying, \"We're all over this Sausage and Stout.\" Done.  They are limited to 23 pizzas per day at $28 for a pizza that feeds two. You can add two pints of Guinness for $5. The pizza definitely had some interesting combinations and was an interesting pairing with the beer. Mainly, it was a salty/sweet clash. Mozzarella, beer sausage, fontina, and beer salt vs. Guinness beer dough, caramelized onion, and an almost overly sweet Guinness reduction. This brought out the crushed red pepper on the pizza and after following with the beer, the malty and burnt tones of the Guinness were accentuated even more. Again, an interesting combination which had me reaching for slice after slice.  We polished off the pizza and beer and with 15% Yelp check in discount, we left pleased and felt we got our money's worth. I'm looking forward to more of what Pizza Rock has to offer.",

So we ordered the fried calamari, meatballs and a chopped Italian salad for lunch I heard the meatballs were really good and they were but the sauce was really good, the calamari was everything I look for in authentic fried calamari plus the spicy remoulade served with it really nailed that dish, and enough for two. The chopped salad was very fresh with all the Italian meats and cheeses debbie liked the artichokes in it, all and all it was a very good lunch, but missed the pizza so now I gotta go back again for his pizza thanks pizza rock for a great pizzaless lunch!",

    "text": "After reading about the Moms Eat Free deal on Monday, I figured this would be the perfect place to go for a family dinner. The deal is that a mom's entree is free for up to $20 when a family member also buys an entree, so my family took advantage of this and we were able to save about $33, which was awesome. For our dinner, we ordered 2 appetizers, the clams and asparagus, and 3 pizzas: the New Yorker, St. Anthony, and Cal Italia.     Both the apps were pretty good. The clams were cooked well and we liked the asparagus, but they were both fairly expensive. While the asparagus was wrapped in proscuitto and topped with a quail egg, the proscuitto didn't have that much flavor and the quail egg just seemed like a small egg. I liked the apps, but I probably wouldn't order them again due to the price.     However, as the name suggests, you come here for the pizza, and this was unquestionably the best pizza I've ever had. The crust was incredible: thin, crispy, and slightly chewy without being too heavy. Of the three, our favorite pizza was the New Yorker, which was huge, super thin, and topped with fennel sausage, pepperoni, and ricotta. The meaty slices of sausage were bursting with juice and flavor, and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. And the cool, creamy dollops of ricotta were so good, the perfect complement to the hot savory pizza.   The St. Anthony was also fantastic and topped with fennel sausage, italian sausage, roasted peppers, 2 runny eggs, ricotta, and red pepper oil. The italian sausage was juicy, had some heat, and a really nice sweetness to it as well. The heat from the peppers and pepper oil added a fantastic hot flavor and necessitated the cool creaminess of the ricotta.  Lastly, while we preferred the more savory pizzas, the Cal Italia was still pretty tasty. It just tasted more like a dessert pizza because of the sweetness from the fig preserve and balsamic reduction.     All in all, I recommend this place to anyone who is craving insanely good gourmet pizza. The only drawback is that the pizzas are somewhat pricey, but this can easily be accounted for if you go with your mom on a Monday.",

But alas we did get the table that we requested and our visit was most enjoyable, not only for the food but the service was exceptional!! This is the very first time that we've ever been served by Jessica and she was amazing! She was very pleasant and did everything she could to make sure our order was right...she was so personable and fun and we are hoping that she will be our server again soon in the near future. Our food was of course very delicious, and thanks to Jessica and the rest of the serving staff this was a very pleasant and visit we can't wait to go back soon. We ordered the appetizers of Meatballs this time and the delicious house salad with grilled chicken...and by the way that salad is perfection. I'm a little picky with my pizza order because I don't like any char on the crust and it came out absolutely perfect. I know that is a crazy request but that is how I like my pizza. Thank you Jessica for making sure our time there was delightful!",

We ordered 2 locally made root beer, a 16 in. New Yorker pizza and some fried green beans. Started off with the amazing rootbeer, we thought it was the best rootbeer we've ever had. Then the fried green beans for appertizer. We ordered this because of its good reviews, however we felt a little disappointed. Maybe it's good to those that never had the green beans cooked this way before, but to us it just tasted like stir fried green beans in lots of olive oil and chopped garlic, no other flavors. We then hope the pizza could save the day and it did. The pizzas in this restaurant are cooked inside the 500 degree hot brick pizza oven. Tomato sauce is made out of fresh whole tomatoes, it burst in the mouth once you bite into it. The crispiness of the pizza dough, the naturally sweetness of the tomato sauce and all other flavors combine made the award winning pizza in Las Vegas - the New Yorker.",

The thin crust pizza, gorgonzola fries, and of course those mouth watering meatballs will have you coming back again...and again...and again.  The bad news now is that I don't live in Vegas and can only admire Pizza Rock from a far... and for sure every time I visit.",

Went there to try their award winning margherita pizza. The fresh ingredients just dance around harmoniously in your mouth. You get tart from the tomatoes, the savory from the sprinkle of sea salt and richness from the olive oil ... then the savory creamy texture from their mozzarella. Man, too good. Second day we were in Vegas my brother went to get their New Yorker and added some arugula to it. Good contrast against the creamy ricotta. Then on our way out from the area we got a pepperoni and cheese to go. I am in love with this place. Next time I'm going to eat there.",

I sat at the counter and said, \"yo, gimmie a slice of your best New York pizza\" and the guy was all like, \"you're not funny\" but he served it up quick and hot anyway.  Was it as good as Giuseppe's back in the old hood? No chance, fruitcake, but I ate it anyway cuz it was pretty damn tasty.    Then I said, \"I want some meat\" and the guy was like \"that's down the street at the Fremont Experience\" and I was like \"no, on my pie, jackass\" and he said, \"you're still not funny but here's a slice of pepperoni\".  I had to slap him around a bit but the slice was amaze-balls.  I would bring my broad here on a classy date, because she loves it when I have marinara on my chin.",

I've tried several of their classic pizzas and more unique pizza combinations and all have been great.  The meatballs are quite large and meaty, this would be best ordered with another dish.  The asparagus and pear arugula salad were also delicious.  The only appetizer I would not order again is the breaded artichoke, it sounded like a good dish to try but I was disappointed.  There was way too much breading on the artichoke, leaving the inside quite mushy.",

You will forever be disappointed in other pizza places. I live in the northwest part of town and now I WILL NOT order pizza anywhere else because it's a disappointment in comparison to how awesome Pizza Rock is! I have had pizza back east and this place is just as good and if not even better. Even my Italian friends give Pizza Rock kudos. All the pizzas are great but the best are either the Slices up front or get the same pizza in the restaurant called the Old New York 22\", if you're sharing. If you get the individual slices they are BIG so have them heat it up order a beverage or take your slice to the bar and order your drink up there. The oven for the slices and old New York is different than the one the other pizzas are made with. The atmosphere is awesome especially in the evenings they have a video DJ playing Thursday to Sunday. If you're visiting Las Vegas you must go to Pizza Rock!!!",

Loud alt rock playing with TVs showing sportscenter .  Our waiter was good and the food was tasty.  Went with the Gorgonzola fries and The New Yorker pizza .  checked in with Yelp and got 15% off the bill. Nice.  You could sit down for lunch or order a slice at the front counter or street window.  Bet thats handy when your bar hopping on Freemont.  Although you couldn't  order by the slice at the table.  You have to get a whole pie.  Would definitely come back and try a Burger, table next to us ordered 3 and they looked pretty good.",

At happy hour, it's a winner, and only $3. Buck a meatball if you want more. 2.Margherita Pizza... at $7 or $8, this pizza would be priced right, and judging the taste, that is all it's worth, but Pizza Rock prices this relatively small (6 pieces) at $17. The rest of their regular menu is priced somewhat out of line, but their pizza?  Come on, get a grip... pizza is one of the least expensive products in an Italian restaurant. Taste and quality... yes it does have decent, but not \"award winning\" taste (maybe they were the only entry).  Barring Chicago's deep dish pizza, which is in a world of it's own, Most of lower New England (MA, CT, RI), and New York have many pizzerias that equal or better Pizza Rock.  Doesn't even come close to Frank Pepe Pizza (Connecticut)",

As we walked in, we were greeted by two very peppy hosts that were more than happy to get us to our table ASAP. Without having to wait 5 minutes, our server came over and took our drink orders (2 iced teas and a coke). Barely 3 minutes, we get drinks. She immediately asked if we were ready to order and we said yes. We ordered calamari, which was perfect (not rubbery at all and lightly breaded), the Michigan avenue ( Paper thin crust. YUM!) , and the Sam Giancana (also delicious). After finishing our meals, they were carefully and courteously boxed (the pizza, as we had finished the calamari). And got the bill, which was not too expensive because of the food and wonderful service. The atmosphere was great. An up-and-coming band called holes and hearts played music most of the time we were there, only stopping to take a drink of water. They were amazing. It was not packed much, as it was 11:30, but still great. I only wished that this place had more business in the morning, as they deserve it. This concludes my review.",

    "text": "The Skinny: awesome happy hour however the regular dinner items were only okay (3.5) service: pretty good for a pizza joint although it wasn't particularly busy when we went (4) value: amazing happy hour for the price while regular dining is a bit pricey for what it is (3.5 round up to a 4 starred review).  Note about the Parking: do not go inside the Casino for validated parking. Just park in the The Grand self-parking lot across the street and the hostess at Pizza Rock will give you a sticker to put on your parking ticket for free parking. Score!  After visiting twice, I have decided I do like Pizza Rock.  The first visit for dinner, I wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered the old Chicago cracker thin crust pizza and a house salad.   The old Chicago pizza was okay but nothing I needed to order again. Specifically, the crust is very burnt on the edges of the pizza which was off-putting. Although the sausage/pepperoni/ricotta cheese combination was good, the pizza felt that it was missing something... like a hit of mushroom to kind of unify all the flavors. It was a bit greasy as well.  The house salad is rather small with a very generic tasting balsamic dressing on top. For $6, I'd pass on this.  Enticed by the happy hour prices, we decided hit this joint again. We ordered the personal pizza sized Molinari and the Cal Italia for $7 each and tried the fried green beans for $3 and fried calamari for $5.  The green beans were pretty good. They are not fried per se but sauteed lightly with a lot of garlic. For those who are watching their waistlines, the amount of oil on the bottom of the bowl is intimidating however. For $3, the serving size is quite generous.  The fried calamari was delicious! The calamari was soft and tender while the breading was appropriately on the lighter side. Portion size was rather large. You can get this dish in either the spicy version/non-spicy version or even half and half. Personally, I found the spicy version to be a little too strong for my tastes so I'll stick to the regular version.  The pizza crust was very good - slightly chewy with a nice crispy bottom which was a good change from the burnt crust on their ol' Chicago.  For me, the Cal Italia was only okay - a bit too sweet due to the figs and balsamic reduction and needs a bit more of the gorgonzola and proscuitto to balance things out. I almost wished they hadn't reduced the balsamic vinegar to retain a bit more of the acidity to the dish.  The Molinari was a great old school pizza - it's basically what they call Everybody's Favourite back home in Canada (Sausage and Mushroom). The crust and sauce was great and everything just went well together. Some may think that it is a little greasy (which it is - no doubt) but that comes with the territory when you serve  3 types of sausage on a pizza. So good and totally guilty pleasure.  Overall, this joint has a lot going for it - the variety on the menu is good and the happy hour deals are excellent. Although some of the items are hit or miss, the Molinari and fried calamari will have me coming back for sure. Service is good if you are going during off peak hours/days (we went Happy Hour during the week and Sunday evening at 5:30pm). Overall 3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4.",

Bottomless mimosas and sangrias ($15), great apps and the pizza of course is very bomb! Had the green beans and fried zucchini, very tasty with side sauce. Meatballs very good taste. Great service and scene. Will visit again!",

Most pizza places that say they have a gluten free crust it still tastes like cardboard but not here, the food is amazing...  The spread they put out for our party there was no end to the food.  Cold Cuts, pasta, salad, pizza, all endless.  I have been here once before and the food is amazing, the prices are little higher then your standard pizza place however, the quality of the ingredients used are WAY above the quality of a normal place.  I really like this place and very excited they are opening one up closer to my house in the Ranch.  If you have never been to this place, you need to definitely venture either downtown or wait for the one to open in Green Valley Ranch and try this place, you will not be disappointed.  One of the best pizza places I have been to in a while.",

The pizza was outstanding! Get it with extra sauce on the side, even better. The service was the best. Our waitress was so sweet and always checked in on us. It didn't take very long to get the food maybe 20 minutes tops and it was pretty busy. They have a bar and plenty of TV to watch your sports. Bathrooms are small but very nice and clean. It's located near the Fremont experience. I will definitely be coming here again I can't wait to try more what's on their menu. The downside though of course around the area there's a lot of homeless people and they will bug you for money.",

    "text": "Mmmmm Pizza Rock! Let me start with normally I'm not a huge pizza person. My husband Joel on the other hand could eat pizza everyday and be perfectly happy. So when our friends Dyanna and Brent suggested pizza for our dinner out one Saturday night I knew Joel would be down!   Since it was Saturday night we had to wait 45 minutes. The hostess were nice, but could have given a little more instruction. They said that they'd text me when our table was ready, but the only text I got was one saying we should head to the hostess stand and wait. Which we did for 15 more minutes. Finally, we were seated. It was a hot night so we ordered lots of water. If your feeling like something other then water they have a fully stocked bar too. Plus, real Mexican Cokes!   Now, let's talk pizza! They have so many! I love that with the description they tell you the degree that they cook the pizza at. From traditional to the unique they have it. Dyanna and I both ordered a side salad and they ordered a New Yorker and we ordered the Cali Italia. Wow! I really enjoyed the salad dressing which was a super garlicky and creamy vinaigrette. Our Cali Italia pizza had a lot of cheeses, sweet fig preserves, prosciutto and a balsamic reduction. It had that total savory, salty and sweet thing going on. A must try if your looking for something non traditional. Dyanna and Brent's pizza was very classic and Joel could not stop talking about it!   The atmosphere, once seated, had a fun rock n roll vibe! Flat screen TVs are all around the restaurant which play old school music videos. Yay! They even have a huge truck in the middle of the place that is the  DJ booth. Along the walls are other rooms that give u some privacy if you have a large group. Perfect for a bachelor or bachelorette party.   Pizza Rock has some tasty pizza. It's been on my mind since we went. Make sure if your going on the weekend you call ahead for a reservation. Also, check Yelp for 15% off your check when you check in. (Make sure you inform your waitress.)Parking can be hard in this area of downtown. I suggest using the Downtown Grand valet. You can park for free and get it validated at the hostess stand at Pizza Rock. Follow these few tips and your experience at Pizza Rock really will rock!",

He suggested a green cucumber Margarita which is exactly as he described, sweet and satisfying with the cooling taste of cucumber. I ordered the cali tal pizza and it was amazing, the balsamic drizzle with the cheese was so satisfying. The prosciutto was a little hard to eat with it. But so worth it",

    "text": "I love this place but recently my visit on 2/27 fell short.  Ordered meatballs and pesto pizza which came with tomatoes.  Meatballs were awesome. What concerned me was the bar service or lack of.  After receiving my order I noticed that the bartenders all started cleaning up the bar.  I mean really cleaning up the bar as in removing everything, packing up and wiping down as if they were getting ready to close for the night.  No one asked if I wanted anything else or another drink.  The message sent was \"we're done here and so are you.\"  However, it was only 11 pm on a Saturday night. When I checked with the front they said the bar is open until 2 am.  Also I didn't care for the to-go containers for the pizza.  The one for pasta rocked but the pizza box was so flimsy and weak my pizza almost fell out a few times. Dominoes has better boxes.  And the grocery store bag I was given to hold everything also didn't work because it was too small to hold everything.  Being that your pizzas can cost up to around $30, investing in a nice paper to-go bag that everything fits in would be nice.  And maybe let your staff know when you close.  I know this place is successful but it is the 2nd place on my Vegas visit that I noticed after experiencing success  seems to go towards an attitude of \"we're popular now so we don't care if you come back\"  Customer service was not a priority and it almost felt inconvenient for me to be at the bar as the servers there were more intent on cleaning up for the evening.  You're still my favorite pizza place downtown but I hope the service at the bar is better next time. Don't forget your customer service skills.",

Location is perfect easy to park . I actually ate here twice once sit in and had a pizza second time was just for a slice. The pizza I had was the new yorker the slice I had was a pepperoni the slice was huge it was a little pricey but no where neer the 100 i dumped  on a slot machine around the corner and the machine didnt feed me. I would eat here again. Im from north new jersey and live in the bay area now I know what good pizza is. This place is worth a try",

First, when I received my pizza, it was cold. To the point that the crust was slimey. In terms of the tomato sauce, chef - use some salt, would you? It was bland. Salt is a catalyst in \"conveying\" flavor. Charred crust can be delicious; however, they have managed to make it bitter to the point of no return. And the basil. Oh don't get me started. I love basil, but the basil on my pie was rotten.  To be honest, Little Ceasars is better tasting, and I don't like Little Ceasars very much. Don't brag about how amazing your pizza is when in all reality, it's nothing to write home about. I would rather pay to fly back to the east coast and get Pepe's or Lombardi's than to ever eat this \"pie\" again.",

Staff is friendly and helpful.  May I mention Kelcie--is the best! Pizza Rock is lucky to have her... As far as your food, it also ROCKS!  I can't remember the name, but I loved the pizza I had. He had a smorgesborge? Of food to share between the 15+ people we had.  Appetizers- calamari, green beans, garlic cheesy bread, meatballs in marinara--it all was awesome!!! Pizzas- across the board, amazing!  Wished my appetite was endless to try all of the food! Desserts- didn't quite make it to those, but will next time! Entertainment vibe is pretty chill, little loud depending on the time of day, very family/kid friendly. (Check out the DJ booth) my kids got a private peek! And they loved it. Parking- is not hard, many options. I parked and Ballys, and validated in the casino. Pizza Rock is totally worth a try, a must see!  I come all the way from southern Cali! Thanks again! J.k family",

The host saw us in line and Double checked to see if we still might want a table. Very nice of him. The guys at the counter seemed to enjoy their work, and were very friendly. The slice I had was great (little bit of a kick to the pepperoni). Will definitely stop by again next time I'm downtown.",

Our salads and the pizza margherita came out first and we devoured everything. On a side note, only a certain number of margherita pizzas are prepared each day so make sure to come early and order one!  Approximately 15 minutes after our food came out, the manager of the restaurant personally came to our table to inform us that our NY pizza was accidentally dropped off at another table. He apologized and offered it to us for FREE. As if that weren't generous enough, he also gave us a FREE order of meatballs. The crazy part is, our NY pizza arrived at our table a few minutes later and we never would have even noticed the mistake. I'm not sure how many other restaurants offer such wonderful service but Pizza Rock definitely deserves 5 stars.",

So if you're in the mood to grab & go you have that option here as well! Pizza is about the same price, though my boyfriend thought slices were larger at the to-go joint..  Ambiance was great! Super relaxed and they played a ton of classic rock/alternative songs. The killers, Muse, Motion city soundtrack (random I know). Pretty large restaurant with plenty of booths and tables set. The bar was large & had awesome happy hour specials. Cheap PBR's whoooo!  As for the food it was super yummmm! Started off with an appetizer, we tried the garlic fries. Perfectly fried to a crisp & the garlic powder/ cheese on top were finger licking good. We ordered the New Yorker pizza... pretty darn good. I myself am more of a deep disher but my boyfriend likes the NY thin crust. Not bad I must say! Very generous on the toppings & the waiter was super prompt.   All in all, this place was rockin'!

We were seated at 1:15. We told the hostess we only had a hour because we were on lunch she said someone would be right with us. 10 minutes later someone finally came and took our order. We let the waiter know we were on our lunch and that we had made a reservation to avoid being rushed and the waiter gave an attitude and said they were busy. (They had one group in the private area and about 3 maybe 4 tables in the restaurant they were slow and we saw at least 3 waiters/waitresses. ) the food was good once we received it 20 minutes later and we had to rush to eat so we would make it back to work in time.

The \"marinara\" is just that...charred crust (which I don't mind) and canned tomatoes with a sprinkle of dried oregano and 5 roasted garlic cloves. I'm sorry but vegan doesn't have to be flavorless. And since when do we just put canned tomatoes on pie? They just taste canned...a few spices go a long way.",

The fries were delicious, but they do not skimp on the garlic, so be forewarned! The Honey Pie pizza would have been great on its own, but my companion insisted on adding spicy  sausage to it. Although tasty, this overwhelmed the flavor of the pizza. It probably would have been good with just regular sausage.   The best part about Pizza Rock is the ambiance! They were playing really fun (and funny) videos on the tv screens all around the restaurant. The volume was loud enough to feel festive, but not so loud that you couldn't hear a conversation.   Rock On, Pizza Rock!",

Truly exceptional Pizza Rock, way to just knock it out of the park and bring my tastebuds along for the ride.

I had the Caprese Salad which was really good although they do not make it traditionally as it should be: Large Buffalo Mozzarella slices with basil and tomato. They just mix it all together with oil and Kalamata olives.   The Rosemary garlic fries are YUM but they charge 0.50 for ranch dressing. My husband had a Calzone which he enjoyed. The prices here are on the high side in my opinion but the pizza sizes seem large. Overall, I'm not rushing to return.",

    "text": "I've eaten at Pizza Rock three times already, so I thought maybe it was about time give a review...This place, without a doubt is serving some of the best pies in Las Vegas. I live in Henderson, so I rarely venture downtown unless friends or family are in town (you know how Hawaii folks love their downtown casinos). but this place is pretty easy to get into, just valet at the Downtown Grand. Walk through and out the side of the casino, and there it is right across the street (be sure to get valet ticket validated at the restaurant, so parking free).  My new absolute favorite pizza is their Cal Italia, topped with a mix of my favorite Italian cheeses (including Gorgonzola, yum!), a nice handful of prosciutto, fig preserve, and finished with a spiral of balsamic sauce. It's a perfect concoction of tastes I like, the hint of sweet with the savory. the crust, awesome with the right amount of crunch.  Other pizza I've tried...the Mob Boss, thick and crunchy awesomeness. The Garlic with clams pizza, tasty, loaded with lots of garlic and the single clam in the shell on each slice is a nice touch (tip: don't eat the shell...). The Romana #2, large served on a board with 3 different pizzas...pepperoni,sausage and cheese on one side, a sweet pesto in the middle, and a pepperoni, with sweet peppers and topped with fresh basil. All delicious.  Besides the outstanding pizza, they also serve some really good pasta dishes. I brought my parents here, my dad had the lasagna and said it was the best he had ever had...the meatballs are amazingly juicy and tasty...the Mac and Cheese, forget about it, it's got bacon in it! Cheesy, porky goodness...  So, after all I've told you, all you want is a salad? Got you covered, the Caesar salad is legit, or try the arugula salad topped with a heap of bacon (or was it pancetta?)...or maybe spring for the Salumi Formaggio (spelling?) board, my wife's favorite. A selection of sliced meats and cheeses, fig preserve and candied walnuts.  So, overall...great experience, prices in line for what you're getting. So what if the music's too loud, I think it's great they have DJ booth built inside the cab of an 18 wheeler!...I mean, who does that? Come on people, try something new, get out of your comfort zone, put down that greasy, congealed slice of pepperoni pizza from the \"Hut\" you're used too. Me, I can't wait to go back...I hear they just opened second Pizza Rock at GVR, so now I won't have to wait until family's in town. Thanks Pizza Rock!",

Even though we werent drinking they informed us of the large array of drafts they have available and the cocktail menu looked great!

Aside from the fact that it's nestled in downtown Las Vegas, where all the strangest people are about, this place was pretty damn good. We ordered Gorgonzola fries and spicy calamari to start. The sauce on the fries was out of this world. The spicy calamari was just that...spicy. Be prepared. But still pretty good.   For Pizza: we ordered \"The Butcher\" and \"Ned Itty\" (possibly the correct name). The Butcher was honestly, just average. But the Ned was excellent. Garlicky. Spinach. Ricotta. Very very good.   Environment: meh, sub par. It was a mix of a diner and those old pizza places you would go to as a kid. For $20+ a pie, they could have classed this place up just a wee bit. Also, as I usually will mention, it was loud. Loud music and loud people. Be prepared!   I am very happy I went and tried it. I can definitely see myself going back again. But I will have to be in the mood for Downtown Las Vegas.",

At one point my fiance (whos had a few at this point) asked our waiter for a small pinch of fennel. To clear an argument/bet with my cousin.

I got it topped with purple potatoes, prosciutto, feta and pesto. WOWZA! Even loved the taste of the oils running all over it! Yes, $6 is a lot for one slice, but it was totally worth it. The pepperoni and cheese is only $4. I just went with fancy schmancy!   I will def be back next time I'm here!",

I've complimented the cooking style of each pizza I've had because that's the best part. This pizza wasn't all fancy with crazy cheeses and ingredients only my foodie gf knows, it was a pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. I pretty much ate about 65% of it. No more weird pizzas for me.",

    "text": "Another great find thanks to the Yelp app!   We were a bit inebriated in DTLV, and wanted to find some food to sober up. I was craving pizza, and Pizza Rock was only two blocks away.  There are two parts to the restaurant, a pizza by the slice counter and a more traditional type of restaurant that has a sports bar type of feel. We initially were seated in the restaurant, but changed our minds as our intention was just to get a quick bite to eat and be on our way.  We decided to give the pizza by the slice counter a try.  I kept it simple and just ordered a couple of slices of pepperoni. They were huge! Very filling and also very tasty.  One of the staff also hooked us up with an order of meatballs! They were outstanding, and sealed the deal that I have to come back here again.  Pizza Rock was a great find in DTLV.  There are so many food options when in Las Vegas, and I was happy that we came across this place.  Great pizza at a good price!",

Sat at a table by the bar and enjoyed the live music along with the NFL games on 5 different big screens. During Sunday brunch Pizza Rock is offers unlimited mimosas for $10.00 per person when a brunch entree is ordered. I opted for a Belgium Blond beer which paired great with the Cali pizza which consists of quail eggs and pork cheek. The pizza dough was thin, light and cooked in a wood burning 900 degrees pizza oven so it only took minutes to receive.  BTW Pizza Rock offers Happy Hour daily and reverse happy hour with discounted prices on appetizers and beverages. I would recommend stopping in if you're in the area.",

We had the Gorgonzola & Apple Salad, I had the New Yorker with a Chianti, and he had the Classic Pepperoni with a local craft beer from Henderson, NV - Citra Rye.  We were pleased, although I didn't feel the Chianti at all.  After about an hour, (he had devoured his pizza minus the slice I had), my pizza was noticeably cold.  I recall earlier this year I had Ethiopian food and ordered the Derek tibs which was served in a hot earthenware dish with hot coals on the bottom - this kept the meat hot for the duration of my meal.  As a recommendation, perhaps integrate this concept to maintain the hot temperature so customers can still enjoy their hot meal after having a great conversation lasting almost two hours.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to a play in downtown Las Vegas.  I had been to Pizza Rock for two Yelp events and I decided to come back for a quick dinner and try some more of their good things.  We started with an order of three meatballs.  They were very good and the tomato sauce was great.  I took the serving spoon and ate some of the leftover sauce like soup.  For our main course, we opted to split a Stromboli. We got the Romano's Original 1950.  It had cheeses, pepperoni, sausage, and sweet peppers.  The crust was thin which is a plus but the interior was missing some filling.  The sausage and pepperoni was meager.  There was a lot of cheese inside and the Stromboli was good.  We were pressed for time.  Our server, Shani, knowing this, brought our check before we were done so paying and getting to our show was easy.  In fact, we arrived at the show 15 minutes early.  A big criticism I have is the LOUD, LOUD music.  At 6:15, they cranked up the volume to just one decibel under now you have to shout to be heard.  Is this really necessary?  When I checked their website, I got the same blast of music and I learned to mute my computer before looking at their site.  Too bad we didn't have a volume control at the table.  I may be back, but if I do return, it will be at an earlier hour when they have lower music--I hope.",

We seriously thought the few times we have been here the salad was better than the pizza.  The service...even though they try hard...it's horrible.  Consistently bad service. They deliver items to the table and then you don't see them forever. Or when you don't need anything they check up on you every thirty seconds.   We are just not fans.

    "text": "Sadly I will never try this cool looking place.  I currently do DoorDash and it was one of the first places I was sent to. The snobby little male bartender with the brown hair ignored me for a very long time when I arrived. He finally did check on me after waiting 10 min. He said the pizza for the delivery should be done shortly.  I stood for another 10 min waiting patiently. Finally after a total of 20 min he asked the cook about the pizza that had already been preordered through DoorDash. It was sitting in a heater oven right under his nose. He handed it to me basically cold. Unfortunately I didn't contact the manager because by this time I'm sure the customer I'm delivering the pizza to is probably hungry. I did try and call after the drop off however it went into a recording. I have declined any deliveries sent from DoorDash to this place due to the lack of respect and appreciation for customer service. The people that order delivery are customers too.  Yes you aren't making money, no tips so you don't see them valuable however if everyone was selfish and thought the way this bartender does there would be no business.  It's about the customer not about yourself and your tips all the time. Yesterday I got a delivery and decided to give them another chance. I stood at the end of the bar, same snobby little bartender walked right past me like I didn't exist. Walked over and began talking to people at the bar. I have been a bartender in many bars and restaurants and have done restaurant business for at least 20 yrs. He's a terrible bartender, he spends most of his time talking and not doing anything other than talking. There was a female bartender making drinks, chatting, and asked me who my pickup was for, multitasking which clearly isn't something this male bartender is capable of. He is the lazy bartender that rides on everyone else's back. I could have been a potential customer however due to him looking down his nose at me and treating me with the lack of respect of being a person. I will always decline DoorDash deliveries from there and will never be a paying customer. I hope Pizza Rock can find a better qualified bartender who cares about all the customers including the ones not in front of him tipping.",

Hostesses were nice and polite from the greeting to explaining the no outside drinks policy. Ivan was prompt in explaining the menu, providing refills and making great suggestions.  Food was delish. Meatballs are in my top 5. Fried artichokes were different but enjoyable. Pizzas were unique and tasty! The River City Ranch was screaming my name as soon as I sat down and I'm so glad I followed my heart. That was my fave of all 3! We also had the Butcher (all meat) and it had an amazingly light yet filling array of some amazing meats. Lastly, we had the New Yorker which was good too but just basic. I like a little more flare with my pizza as opposed to something traditional. It is an award winner for those of you who enjoy the simpler things in life.",

    "text": "IMHO, Old School Pizzeria has the best pizza in the Valley. But Pizza Rock is pretty darn close.  I went with some co-workers to celebrate a birthday. I had heard horror stories about the wait times, but there were plenty of empty tables at lunch. And none of us are fans of the downtown parking situation, but you can park at the nearby Downtown Grand and get your ticket validated by the Pizza Rock hostess. So my first tip is to go for lunch (or, maybe, for happy hour) to save yourself some time and money!  Two of the ladies ordered the fried green tomato caprese. I tried a bite and wasn't too impressed, although it was a lot better after I added a touch of balsamic reduction. Another pair of ladies split a pizza. I didn't get the name, but it was topped with a ton of meat and looked pretty good (and they seemed to enjoy it). I went to the front of the house and ordered the slice of the day, which was bacon and serrano peppers. The last of my co-workers followed suit and ordered a slice of the vegetarian. $6 a slice, but these were monster slices--and delicious to boot! (Tip #2.)  Too bad we had to return to work (except for the birthday girl, who stuck around for a drink), because their beer selection was calling out my name. I think I'll return for happy hour soon, or maybe for their Sunday brunch, which is a favorite of the aforementioned birthday girl. Bottomless mimosas! Hello!  Overall, I guess the hype is True: Pizza Rock DOES rock! I just wish it were a little closer to home and not quite so expensive.",

We did not realize we had made it in time for happy hour until our server told us and showed us the happy hour specials. So we had the meatballs, fried green beans, and personal pizzas. That was way more than enough food for the two of us and way cheaper than just getting one big pizza to share.  Would definitely eat here again and again.  July 10, 2018, A review update. I had a friend come out to Vegas in January on business and she booked dinner here for 20 people due to my recommendation. She said it could not have been more awful. The waiter was inattentive. The green beans were soggy and limp, meatballs were good, pizza was terrible. I felt so bad that they had such a horrible experience, everyone in her group was complaining and said they should have eaten elsewhere. Well I have learned not to recommend anything to anybody ever again. I was so sorry to hear they had a terrible dinner.",

    "text": "I went to pizza rock last night because I wanted pizza near Fremont and recognized the brand from when I lived in Utah. I have always heard good things, so we ventured in on a Saturday night. The entrance had an area you could order to go and apparently some slices? We didn't check it out much since we wanted to dine in. The wait was going to be about 15-20 according to the hostess, but it only took us about 10 minutes to get seated. I did go to the bathroom at that time and it was well maintained, which is always a good sign!   They sat us in the room closest to the bar. The place had tons of TVs so it would be a great place to go on a game night. It is a very loud place, so i definitely had a hard time talking with my date over the small table. The prices all seemed very reasonable for the items listed. We went basic and got a pepperoni pizza, but they had all sorts of awesome creative and foodie type of pizzas preplanned on the menu. We just weren't feeling it this particular night to go fancy in flavor. The pizza fed the 2 of us perfectly (they come presized, so no picking larges or smalls). We liked the crust, but some of it was burnt so not as tasty. It was a little heavy on the grease for my stomach and what I'm used to. Our waitress was super prompt in the beginning, but did a classic fade out.....as soon as we started truly needing attention for refills, she became harder to find. We were done with our pizza in about 10 minutes but we stayed another 5 mins after waiting for the bill and another 5 or so waiting to get our credit card back. That's a pet peeve of mine. I'm done! Turn the table and take my money! Ugh. Anyways, all in all it was not a bad experience. I would recommend this spot for anyone who loves pizza fired and cooked in different methods, or crafty toppings.",

I think we might have ordered the wrong pizzas (we had to stick to vegetarian options since one person in our group is a vegetarian), because we didn't quite seem to enjoy it as much as others on Yelp and TripAdvisor did.   We had the Artichoke pizza and the Margherita pizza, which we all thought was a little underwhelming. It wasn't a bad pizza by any means, but it wasn't considered great in our standards. Or perhaps my pizza standards are just way too high since I'm from New York??   Service was attentive enough and we were in and out pretty quickly. It filled us up without breaking the bank - plus they were able to split the bill into 4 cards, which was really helpful.   I think if I'm ever back in Vegas, I might give them another try - but I'd definitely try a meat pizza next time!",

Meatballs, garlic string beans, the New Yorker, Cal Italia, etc. I want to know what the hell happened to the New Yorker?! It had an excessive amount of tomato sauce on it. I can only taste the tomato sauce and the pizza overall was a lot saltier than usual. Barely any ricotta too. I only ate one slice. :/  Service is always good. I've never had an issue with their service. Glad they turned the music down. The old fart in me always thought it was too loud in here with the rock music. I will come back but the past few times, I have been going to the Green Valley location and it was excellent. Please fix your New Yorker! Thank you.",

The sauce is a star. Real tomato... and that matters!!! You can purchase by the slice to-go which is a bonus!!!!!",

We do not eat pork and requested some type of alternative so that we can enjoy a good pizza. Instead she totally called us out and spoke to without integrity. When a person has a management role they need to be able to wear all hats at all times and be humble respectful towards not only the customers but also their employees which I did not see from her if it were not for the food and the other two people that I mentioned above I would've definitely not even given any stars to this restaurant because of Maddie.",

If it weren't for the appetizer they probably would have received a 2 star.   My boyfriend ordered the Butcher pizza and loved it. Full of meat and thin how we like it.   The service was alright.

If you plan on eating a slice or two, they have a take out window and bar at the entrance - You can have pizza by the slice that way. You can also go during happy hour and get a personal pizza of your choice.   Service was good! Our server was really nice and helpful. They ran out of hard cider, which made me sad since I do not like taste of beer. He suggested I try the grapefruit ale. It was really good and a wonderful alternative. My husband loved the different beer choices and how knowledgeable the staff were on the lagers and ales.   The ambiance is super classy and modern. This is more of a place to enjoy, sit, and drink - not to get drunk. I really appreciate that since it seems that in Vegas there are so many drunk people walking all over the place. Pizza Rock was a good place to drink and enjoy!",

    "text": "After working in the restaurant industry for five years I tend to judge my servers when I go out to eat, always tipping more then 20%. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. We had a party of eighteen. I arrived before everyone and was immediately shown to the table, a nice cozy room off of the main dining room. The temperature was a little chilly. The rest of the party arrived and a couple minutes later our server came by he took half of the drink orders then proceeded to walk away.  My table ordered a couple pizzas at this time and he did not think about asking the second table of they would like to place an order as well.   The drinks were dropped off and he immediately walked away and did not take the rest of the orders. After asking for the server on three separate occasions he finally made his way back fifteen minutes later. By this time my tables food had arrived and we began to eat. The server proceeded to give attitude and smart comments to one of the guests at the second table when a comment was made about his negligence to their table.   The second table did not receive their food until our table was finished eating. The server did not check back and ask how the food was or ask if anyone would like a refills. The pizza was good minus the fact it came out a little on the cold side.   Overall I can say at the numerous restaurants I have worked at (one being a fine dining restaurant Cucina by Wolfgang Puck) this type of service and attitude would have never happened nor been accepted by management from me or my fellow servers. I am very disappointed on how the dining experience went and would not recommend coming with a large party because the server we had can obviously not handle larger parties.  We spoke to the manager mid way through the meal. We received the check and nothing was done with it. I am not one to go out and assume a discount for shitty service but when there is an issue some sort of discount should be given. After receiving the bill we spoke to the manager again and did receive a 15% discount.   Everyone in the party was very disappointed with the wait staff and the food being cold. Pizza Rock will not have our business next time we are in Vegas.",

We started out with a small Caesar which is weird, because the menu listed only one size, but I gotta say it was the best Caesar salad I had in a very long time. I'm still dreaming of it. Usually anchovies are brown/gray in color these were white. We also had the fried artichokes which looked like two pieces of fried chicken, yes two, so if your party is larger than 2, I'd suggest ordering more. it came with a thousand island looking dressing which was flavored with horse radish. After this pizza came I used this sauce for the ends of my crust. We also ordered the picante style pizza, which is a some what spicy pizza with Serrano peppers, banana peppers, calabrese peppers, linguica, cholulua sauce, and chorizo. Things u must know:   A) there's a yelp coupon if you check in here for 15% off your bill  B) if you want to dine in but want slices you have to order from the front first because the front take out and the restaurant do separate things was what the waiter said.   C) if you see something from the front that you like, buy it cuz it runs out.  D) the front counter serves pizza with pineapples but not the back, I saw a pie with jalapenos,pepperoni, pineapples, and dollups of ricotta that I coveted but when I got back they sold out :(.   E) valet parking at the grand hotel which is located right across the street.",

The bar selection is great and they serve beer on Nitro meaning the flavor is way more smooth.  All of the food i have eaten here has been great.  Mac and cheese, pizza, cal-zones, all amazing.  I would say if your in the mood for a lot of pizza, get a deep dish for sure.    Staff is awesome and love the look of the restaurant.  Great to watch a sports game or just have an awesome meal.  One of my spots i visit every time i am in town.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock is OFF THE CHART great pizza.  Anytime I'm anywhere near Downtown Vegas, I suggest it as our dining choice.  My favorite pizza by far is the Sausage and Stout pizza -- it was introduced around St. Patrick's Day last March and hadn't been printed on the menu the last time I was in (mid-July) - but I'm hoping it has now.  Absolutely amazing.  My next fave is the Honey Pie - it's the perfect combination of sweet and hot with a mixture of honey and peppers...really good if you like a little kick in your mouth after a bite.  My friends ordered the Tomato Pie on our last visit (not being as adventurous for spice as I am) and it was also great -- very traditionally Italian tasting.  I've also had the mac & cheese, fried green beans and garlic bread on other visits...so I can highly recommend those.  I wish I could recommend other items, but I love the above three so much that they're all I can ever bring myself to order!  Really looking forward to the opening of the next restaurant in Green Valley because it's about 15 miles closer to my house!",

Took a seat at the bar and a nice server named Ashley came over.   Finding myself completely alone at the spacious, circular bar and completely unfamiliar with the menu, I threw myself at Ashley's mercy. I asked what she liked. She recommended a popular pizza called the Cal Italia. It was a meat-free pizza but \"don't knock it 'till you try it,\" she told me.   Oh, and I should mention this pizza won the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge. So honor this pizza!  Ashley had enough charisma and steadiness to her voice that I decided to trust her.   I'm glad I did. This pizza was not only a beautiful work to look upon, but was very tasty as well. Tons of flavor. I'd rank it up there as one of my top five pizzas ever. Seriously. Loaded with asiago, Mozzarella, imported Gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and balsamic reduction. The combination works majestically.   See the pic I uploaded here and tell me she ain't a beaut! A swirly kind of \"optical illusion\" kinda pizza.  Ashley noticed I didn't finish my crust. Yeah I don't like to down an entire pizza and if I leave the crust I feel like I only ate half.   Try this place out. Full bar, tables, and a counter.   Pizza Rock rocks!",

We had the grilled asparagus, friend calamari (spicy and non spicy), garlic bread, and La Regina pizza. The grilled asparagus was the best appetizer. The asparagus was wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled in a balsamic vinegar glaze. The pizza was delicious as well. The crust was very thick which was a little surprising.   The atmosphere was 2 stars. There were TVs everywhere which played terribly remixed music videos. It was pretty distracting for everyone in the restaurant. The music was really loud and it was difficult to hear anyone.   One good thing - reverse happy hour starting at 10pm.",

    "text": "I went to Pizza Rock with high expectations, based on some articles and reviews I had read, and the fact that it features international award-winning pizza.  But,  unfortunately, those expectations were not entirely met.  Italian Wedding Soup was very good spicy and hearty soup, but nothing like traditional Italian Wedding Soup.  It was more like Minestrone with medium-sized meatballs, carrots, celery, tomatoes, ditalini noodles, and basil.  I was mostly pleased with a Classic Caesar Salad that sported a good light Caesar Dressing with a little kick to it and a little sour flavoring, cold Romaine leaves, and lemony pieces of Parmesan sheets.  But it was in the all-important pizza department that I was somewhat disappointed.  A Three Cheese & Ham Pizza with extra cheese was very good except for the Parmesan powder tossed on top.  And the internationally recognized Margherita Pizza was excellent.  No complaints there!  But, with respect to the New Yorker, which was voted the Best Traditional Pizza in the World, I felt that the Ricotta Cheese and tomato sauce were overpowering and in too much supply, compared with the amount of sliced Mozzarella, sliced House Link Sausage, garlic, and pepperoni that shared the stage; and the crust was much thinner than I prefer.    Overall, from my single experience, although the Margherita Pizza prepared here can definitely hold its own, even in the Las Vegas valley alone I would rank the other types of pizza I tried here behind Dom DeMarco's, Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza, Metro Pizza, Settebello's, Biaggio's, and Enzo's.  The place has a nice spacious and informal ambiance, although it is rather dark inside.  Besides a large bar, white butcher paper is spread on white formica and black-edged tables.  Our server Allie provided friendly and very helpful service.    The pizza sampled here was not at all bad.  It just wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  3-1/2 stars overall!",

Once for an actual sit down dinner and two other times for a meeting in the back by the bar where they kept bringing pizza out and we had an open bar.  Most of the pizza that came out during our business meeting party was fresh and from the Pizza Romana I, II, or III options but sectioned off.  But I've also had the Margherita, Farmers Market special, New Yorker, and Mastunicola pies.    Although the ingredients are top notch, it doesn't entirely impress me to go out of my way to come down here.    I do however enjoy this atmosphere a lot more than Rock Pizza up in Seattle.  This place is newer and has a better feel good vibe with a lot of TV's, music, and a better men's bathroom wall art up above but I'm all for gimmick.  If I'm downtown I think I'd still rather have my pies at Pop Up.",

Loved, that they were allowed to write on the paper table cloth. Loved the pizza.  I asked the 8 eight year old if she had fun and she said \"Yup\". Asked if she wants to go back. \"Yes.\" Was her answer.  Then I asked my 6 year old the same questions. She nodded her head \"yes\" when asked if she liked it. She was chewing up some pizza crust. Return? The six year old wants to go there on her birthday!  When we arrived, we checked in for Yelp. We then received a discount which saved us a few extra bucks for gas money. Nothing wrong with that! Too bad the Mayor, Carolyn Goodman wasn't there this time.  Kids would have gone bonkers.   My wife, a girl scout troop leader noticed Pizza Rock offers classes for kids to make pizzas. Hmm do I smell a girl scout badge? Nope just more delicious food at Pizza Rock!",

There was only 4 people infront of us and it took around 15 mins to get served!! Then again there was only one guy serving but after a while some other people came and yet it was still slow!! I would've rated this place better if the service wasn't a let down.",

It is rock n' roll themed, complete with a live VJ the night I went. The VJ of the night played a lot of songs from the 90s, and it was actually really cool to see how they inspired the current songs. However, this makes for a rather loud experience, and we could barely talk to each other during dinner.  We got the famous margherita pizza, and a sausage pizza (the Sam Giancana). The pizzas were decent -- each of us had our own preference, mine being the margherita. The crust was thin and chewy, and the tomato sauce was delicious. I would just mop up the tomato sauce on its own.  However, combining the service, ambiance, and food, it's not really worth the price. It's like you're paying your way into a very, very expensive frat party.",

We then ordered and got our 3 pizzas and they were in fact soggy. Our waitress wondered over and filled the iced teas and never came back. We were finished and ready to go, no drinks filled and she was no where to be found. I had to ask the hostess to find her in which she took 15 minutes and then 15 to bring us our card back. This was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, not to mention an \"award winning\" one. There was 6 of us on a slow couple hours.

We still steered clear of their lengthy alcohol list so we wouldn't zonk out at the table. (The soup of the day was beer, haha). If we hadn't been splitting a pizza, I would've LOVED a calzone. Everything seemed super authentic and mouth-wateringly delicious. Maybe next time :)",

    "text": "There are now two things that Las Vegas has completely ruined for me: Hainanese Chicken Rice and pizza.   I'm not a big pizza head. I don't generally crave it, don't gotta have it, rarely even think of it as food. But when I want pizza, I usually want Chicago deep dish. Which I did that one evening in Las Vegas. And as luck would have it, I happened by Pizza Rock after the introduction of the Detroit Red Top.   We stopped by on a Saturday evening and the line was out the door, for both the restaurant and at the counter where you can buy individual slices. The wait for a table was going to be an hour. But don't despair and don't give up! Just push on in and find the huge bar that has open seating all around. You'll find a spot there. It may take a few minutes, but this isn't the sort of place where people hog spaces at the bar if there are others waiting. Nice crowd!  The place is loud, so you do have to yell a bit to be heard or to get a bartender's attention. It's all worth it though when you finally sink your teeth into that crispy, cheese-baked-into-the-crust Detroit Red Top. Lots of interesting beers on draft, including Not Your Father's Root Beer, which was my first encounter with an alcoholic root beer. The decor was very modern rock and roll and you could see what I thought was The Pizza Oven from the bar. Turns out, that was only a pizza oven. This place does something I've not encountered--they have different ovens for different styles of pizza. Totally makes sense! The pies are huge, so we didn't get to anything other than the red top, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat. In fact, this place even makes me crave pizza.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock  Location/Parking: Across from Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino. Limited parking in front of the restaurant, so park in the hotel garage.  Atmosphere: Casual and friendly. There's a nice dining room if you want a sit-down meal, a walk-up order counter inside for take-out orders, and a walk-up window outside if you don't feel like coming inside at all.   Cleanliness: No issues. The one time I sat down to a table in the dining room was very pleasant.   Service: The service inside and outside is great, but the walk-up window isn't open that late. When it's open it's fine, but it closes at midnight. Midnight? In Vegas? For a walk-up window? Don't they realize how many drunk tourists are out there stumbling around looking for a good slice of cheese at 3am? Sadly, they have lost my business more than a few times for closing early.  Food/Drinks: I've been here four times so far and have ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni from the counter and from the outside window, and I've had a whole pepperoni pie inside in the dining room. Good stuff. They even have a gluten free crust available, but if I'm going to cheat and eat pizza, I'm going balls to the wall and getting the good stuff. Speaking of good stuff, the Chianti they serve is really nice.   Happy Hour: I haven't been lucky enough to hit it at the right time, but they have a Happy Hour 3-5-7 Menu. Monday-Friday 3pm-6pm and late night 10pm to close. Draft beers $3-$5 and wines by the glass $2 off. Several snacky size appetizers for $3, $5, or $7. Probably worth trying if you're in the area.  Price: $4 for a slice of cheese, $4.50 for pepperoni. Totally reasonable for such delicious cheesy goodness, especially in Vegas. Full menu available for inside dining, but let's be honest, 99% of the time you just want a quick, hot, delicious slice of cheese to go. How you negotiate eating it while walking around downtown sipping a 100-oz. adult beverage through a ginormous straw? Well, that's on you.",

Now these slices are HUGE!  I chose Pepperoni and was very pleased with the taste, a little greasy but fat is flavor right?   I will say that I was disappointed to see that a cheese pizza that just came out of the oven was tossed into the garbage right in front of us.  I saw the cook lift it up a little and I guess to him it was more on the well done side so he tossed it.   I get that there is a certain quality they are going for and although I appreciate that as the consumer, wasting food is not a good impression.  It was salvageable and they could definitely think about donating their slightly imperfect pies to some of the local shelters, or some of the food service programs for the homeless (rescue mission) just saying.     They have daily specials and honestly they all looked delicious, and the place always looks busy which is a great sign.   There were a few of us using our complimentary slice coupons that were graciously given to us by the facility some time ago and we just never thought we would take advantage of these until now, the only problem I found is that the worker taking them had a bit of an attitude and kept repeating \"Oh you have one too?\" in a bothered sort of way.  Oh well thank you, I still enjoyed my slice!",

    "text": "Nice upbeat kind of place, lots of TVs.  Pizza ingredients are top notch.  Their red sauce is delicious.  Not that most of their pizzas are a little bit thicker than NY style pizzas, but we ordered the award winning New Yorker.  As I said, delicious ingredients BUT VERY POOR CONSTRUCTION.  You can tell the guy making the pizzas is probably burnt out as cheese coverage was very uneven, bare in spots, and he put WAY TOO MUCH RED SAUCE.  I had piles of red sauce on my plate after eating.    They need to check themselves on how carefully they build their pizzas.  Most of their pizza's are 13\", New Yorker is 16\".  I'd say they could feed two adults each.  So this place is a relatively cheap place to eat compared to other places.  Decent drink prices.",

Menu on the table and offered drink selections and food options. We tried the 3 meatballs with sauce and the garlic bread. Very delicious together when you dip the bread in the warm goodness, yummy!! Next we ordered the Americano pizza and drum roll pleaseeeeeee. What a wonderful delight, mouth watering, cheese pulling, warm explosion of flavors on my taste buds. Read a few reviews that made me skeptical but glad I ignored them and gave it a try. I would recommend and return, thanks for a pleasant experience.  You Rock",

    "text": "Best pizza of my life so far, definitely not the best service though.  We had 2 pies, the margarita and the New Yorker. They serve all different styles of pizza. We chose these two because they are classics and both won awards. The New Yorker was hands down the best. We love good crust, simple and fresh ingredients and this one delivered. A must get in my opinion with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, ricotta, sauce dollops and a garlic base.   The restaurant itself is great. It is a pizzeria when you walk in, but the restaurant area has a great industrial ambience. We were just two and had a great table enclosed with curtains which felt romantic.   The service fell way short though. It was a busy Friday night. Our server had a large table, and it was pretty obvious our 2 top was not her priority. We ordered apps and a salad, and our table was pretty small. When our two pizzas came no one cleared the dirty app or salad plate and didn't leave any room for us to eat the pizza. We actually had to ask someone to make room for us and clear our plates. Then we were left with no plates to share our pizza so our pizza sat for a while before we could get someone else over to our table to help us. Our server after rushing us through our drink and food order was never to be seen again until bringing our check. I don't really care that it was a busy Friday or that she has a bigger table, your 2 top is just as important as your 8 top. And if you have staff running food and refilling water they should see a table full of dirty dishes and 2 customers not eating their pizza and fix that. I don't think that's really above and beyond service, that's just basic service...  However we will be returning when in Vegas again, and will give both the pizza and the service another try!",

    "text": "If you want to eat yummy pizza while a DJ spins top hits out of a semi truck, you gotta check out Pizza Rock! First things first, we parked at Binion's and walked a few blocks over. Yes you have to pay for parking, but it's the easiest way. They said the wait for 4 on a Saturday night was around 1.5 hours. We were able to get on a waiting list and gave them our cell number so they could text us when our table was ready. Then we went and hung out on Fremont St. for a bit. I got a text after about 45 minutes so we made out way back and were seated right away! The vibe is relaxed and chill inside.   We ordered: Pancetta & Arugula Salad  Beer Battered Artichokes 6 Meatballs River City Ranch Pizza (ranch, chicken, mozzarella, bacon, garlic, cherry tomatoes, green onion) The Butcher Pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, Genoa salami, pepperoni, bacon, linguica, Italian sausage, mortadella, hot coppa, prosciutto)  Salad, meatballs and appetizers came out right away.  Like I am talking within 5 minutes of ordering. I loved the salad, although it was a bit under dressed. The pancetta was crispy and salty and paired nicely with the peppery arugula. The artichokes were just ok, but I liked the dipping sauce that came with them. BTW I love dipping sauces. The meatballs were amazing, I love their marinara sauce as well.  Pizzas came out shortly after our apps. I should mention that the pizzas only come one size. The ones we got were listed as 12-13\", which seems small, but it was more than enough food. I tried the river city pizza which was good, but very salty. Maybe because of the ranch? Speaking of ranch, theirs is excellent! I was too full to try the other pizza, plus I don't really care for all that meat on my pie, but it was gone so I assume it was good. Total for 4 of us was just around $100 with tax and tip. Food good, service good, vibe good! I will be back!  FYI - If you just want a slice to-go, they have a walk-up counter inside the restaurant to get slices, but from what I saw it looked like select items only.",

Having tried dozens of different pizza places, whether they be mom and pop shops, or simple commercial, Pizza Rock undoubtedly takes the crown as king. I've tried their cal italia, new yorker, and margherita pizza on differing occasions, and all I have to say, is it's worth the drive to downtown.   The cal italia was such a fulfilling pizza; with the balasmic reduction and fig creating a balanced concoction of deliciousness.   The margherita pizza was exactly what you would hope to get from one. Tender crust, great sauce, and fresh cheese. It was light and satisfying.  As for the new yorker, it would be worth paying even $35 for it. Coming from an avid meat lovers pizza enthusiast, this pie is all you need in your life. Its almost a sin to grab more than one slice. The meat is succulent with a light kick, the cheese creamy and chewy, and crust perfectly foldable. Highly recommend trying!",

Below are my rankings:  #1 Michigan Ave (ask for it to be lightly cooked. Trust me)  #2 Old Chicago  #3 Americano  Also the meatballs and the Gorgonzola fries are UNBELIEVABLE! Meatballs at a pizza place?? What?? Seriously though, these are better than any Italian place in LV and I have been to them all!   The trick is to head down during Happy Hour 3PM-6PM M-F (or after 10PM). Fries are $4 and Meatballs are $6. Also they have personal pizza's for $7 during that time.  No matter what kind of pizza you like these guys have it all and it's all good. Must try!",

Super close to Fremont area which is great if your visiting and don't have a car or if your just bar hoping in the area.",

I love that they have a full sized peter-built truck in dining room. Although I've notice some difference between the dine in pizza kitchen and guys that do carry out, the Guys in the front who make the carry out slices, do a better job then guys in main pizza kitchen.  What's cool is you can have different styles of pizza cooked in different ovens, 900, 750 and 550 degree.  I had a 900 degree pie, which they sell as authentic Italian, that wasn't so good, the server removed it without a hassle. Which was awesome, the fact it's a 900 wood cooked pizza , it should have had some  charring with a varying degree of soupiness in the center.  however the line between charred and burnt is very fine. To me it was burnt, but some of the dough was a little under cooked. This is a tough call here so im not going to knock the rock. I'll be back no doubt , just sticking with the 550 degree American pizza.",

Definetly come during happy hour if you can...can't beat the low prices and the amount of food you get for them. A personal pizza for $5-7 and huge portion appitizers for $2-5 plus drinks were only $3-5 during happy hour as well. We will definetly be back during our next trip!",

The ricotta cheese on the New Yorker was a perfect compliment to the whole taste of the pizza! I made sure to smear it all over my piece:) mmmm mmmm mmmm  note... The New Yorker was mostly a meat pizza with in house homemade sausage..yummy  The Downtown was loaded with beautiful veggies and with homemade sausage also.  Both were fabulous!

I realize it was packed so they don't get one more star taken off.  We never had water without asking and when we did ask they ignored us.  What really cost them points is seeing others come in after us get their pizza before us.  Our 7 year old was already done with her Mac and Cheese before they came to check on us, only to realize we hadn't eaten.  It wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't there for a birthday dinner.  The manager was sent over, he apologized and said he would put in a rush and make something special.  Well all the pizzas came out burnt.  The rock hard crust had me gasping for air or water to wash it down only when I reached for the water... you guessed it, I didn't have any.  One last chance, happy birthday song...  Nope they were too busy.     When it came time for the check they chraged us for an apple juice which should have come with the kids menu.  Live and learn.",

The crust has a little crisp to it when you bite but inside, warm soft and chewy.  Add a cocktail to that and you have a WINNER!

The taste was meh the sauce to me reminded me of  Prego spaghetti sauce lacking in flavor and the crust left mech to be desired for, they were both in desperate need of some garlic. The pizza was extremely greasy although pizza is greasy this was a bit much. So much so I couldn't even finish half of my slice and it ended up in the trash, and that's saying a lot because pizza is my absolute favorite, would  I return there most likely not but after a drunken night in Vegas maybe.",

I'm so glad that we finally went and tried it. It is a really relaxed atmosphere and our server was really nice and friendly. We went about an hour before closing time. They never rushed us or anything, but we lucked out and it was happy hour. The tall can PBR is only a few bucks and a bunch of the appetizers are on sale during happy hour.  We tried the meat lovers pizza and it was literally the best pizza I've ever had anywhere. The crust was perfectly crispy with a slight chewiness and softness. The meats are all really high quality. The sauce is sweet and it pairs really well with the saltiness of the meats. We also had the gorganzola fries which are beyond delicious. The fries are perfectly crispy with creamy cheese in every bite. I've been to Vegas dozens of times and this place is my new favorite low key spot in downtown.",

The pizza came in a thin crust and it was deeeeelicious!!!! We asked for extra garlic on it and they brought it out with some roasted garlic bits on the pizza. That definitely gave it that extra kick of deliciousness!!!! Ashley, our waitress was courteous and friendly. Overall, our experience here at Pizza Rock was great!!!! I definitely recomend this place if you are a local or just visiting Las Vegas.",

It was absolutely terrible! When picking up a slice everything on it fell off and the crust was like mush. Defiantly not how it was suppose to be. We sent it back (before I got a picture) and waited for a new one. After 20-25 minutes we were still waiting for our pizza.... getting a little mad it was taking so long. Obviously we weren't a priory. We finally decided to cancel the order. While canceling we were told our pizza went to another table & they were complaining  about it too. WTF! The bartender took the pizza off the bill & gave us a free drink so no problems with his service but really doesn't help with the poor quality & inability to correct it. We left & ate elsewhere.   We used to recommend Pizza Rock to everyone and bring friends & family here when they visit from out of town. That won't happen anymore. Not sure if we will return.",

Upon arrival around 945 pm the restaurant was pretty packed as well as the to go area at entrance. We had a short wait time prior to being sat. Good enough for me on a Saturday night.  We sat just as late night happy hour started at 10pm. They had some great prices on personal sized pizzas, appetizers, beer & spirits.  Our menu consisted of:  Italian Fries 5/5 yummmmm! Zucchini Fries 5/5 yummmmm! Cal Italia 5/5 double yummmmm! Pesto Paradise 5/5 double yummmmm! Italian Chop Salad 4/5 ordinary but still yum Mac & Cheese 5/5 yummmm! W/ 2 draft beers Total tab: $65.00  Honestly the menu was pretty massive so we kinda stuck to the happy hour menu and just chose a salad and a pasta from the regular menu since none were available on happy hour.  Overall we were extremely pleased with our selections and the total tab, service was excellent also. We will definitely be back again to maybe try some different menu items.",

Wake up management Something is wrong and locals like me wont stand for repeated crap service. I don't get it. I deliberately visit on non busy days/times. I can't imagine what it would be like when they are busy.   I have only experienced this at the downtown location. Had good experiences so far at Henderson location.

    "text": "I've asked a few foodies for pizza recommendation at Downtown Las Vegas, they all mentioned about this place. I wish I would love it, but no! Just disappointed.   FOOD: 7/10. I saw the special  \"sausage and stout\" one on yelp, and it said only served for limited quantity, of course I wanted to try! But totally not my style. The crust was SO THICK, HARD AND DRY. The sausage and bbq sauce combination was not satisfying and the cheese cannot pull out long AT ALL.   The only reason I didn't give it lower 5 is because of the meatball. On point, very delicious.  ATMOSPHERE: 8/10. I guess this is a neighborhood restaurant, so not fancy or creative like those on the strip. Clean, spacious, but loud and dime.   PRICE: $$. Reasonable.   SERVICE: 6/10. The hostess of that night (blond long hair) was really nice! We walked in without reservation, and she recommended us to seat at the bar and after 10-15 mins, she came to tell us a table was available if we wanted to move there. Very sweet. HOWEVER, our waitress was friendly but not helpful. I wanted to add a dish, but I can barely find her during our meal, so I had to find someone else for help. No water refill, only saw her when our beer was empty.   Tips: I'm not an expert of pizza, so I don't know what NY, Californian, Italian style mean. I just love soft crust with great cheese-pull and fresh topping. So I may just order a wrong pizza. But my suggestion is if u really want to try this place? Since it has a very high score, just buy a slice at the To-go window. I remember it's about $6/ slice. No need to sit down and have a full meal if u r a tourist like us. Eventually we still paid $60+ for two (with beers), which we can get a decent buffet already. Sorry, can't recommend this place.",

I didn't see a build-your-own pizza option, which would have been nice. We had the Vedura pizza and the veggies on it were marinated differently. So, onions tasted one way and tomatoes tasted another. It was a bit overwhelming and very vinegary. Plus there were two types of cheese on it--feta and mozzarella. Not a huge fan. We also ordered the Gorgonzola and Apple Salad which was drenched in dressing and mostly just a big bowl of salad greens. The thing that bothered me the most about this place was the dirty tables. We were surrounded by empty tables covered in dirty plates and glasses. Waiters would dump dirty plates on the tables instead of just taking them into the kitchen. It took quite a while for them to be bused. Maybe the boss was out that day....",

We also ordered chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was disgusting. The pizza was overcooked, and the crust was impossible to bite into hurt my teeth when I tried to eat it. The toppings were not spread out properly so some parts of the pizza had a lot of bacon the other had nothing. We specifically asked the server if there was a lot of ranch And he  told us there is light ranch on the pizza however when I took that one bite I felt like I ate a spoon full of ranch. After ordering our pizza we never saw our server again. Another one of their staff came by and started helping us but didn't bother to ask if our food was good. It was obvious it sucked since we only ate half a slice of a 16\" pizza. For $21 bucks it was definitely a waste of money. Blaze pizza cost $8  and it's better than any pizza this place has to offer. I wish my experience was as good as everyone else's but we were definitely not impressed. Won't be returning here.",

    "text": "While exploring the Fremont Experience, I found the Pizza Rock; I have read about it on Eater's Vegas page and reading about the famous chef I was hoping to see them. Entering the building, I saw the cooks make a massive pizza with ricotta cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni and while the pizzas looked amazing, I decided on a calzone. The prices for their items are prices reasonable and the calzone I devoured was delicious; the cheese oozes while the meatballs were delicious and nicely seasoned. My only complaint is the size of the calzone (and even the slices of pizza) are quite big and may be too much for some people",

I find that completely ridiculous. How can a neighborhood less than a half mile from the restaurant be \"out of our delivery range\"? This smacks of some sort of discrimination (like my neighborhood is a \"bad neighborhood\" or something). Get it together, guys.",

You can order \"by the slice\" when you walk in the front door or choose to be seated. I decided to sit at the bar and peruse the menu.  The menu was overwhelming so after a good fifteen minutes I decided to go up front and get a slice. It was delicious!!  It was so good that I returned the next night with my wife and ordered a different pizza. I will give Pizza Rock 4 stars, easily. Eric, the man behind the bar was professional and helpful. I will return to Pizza Rock to try their pasta  the next time I am in Vegas and give them a shot at that 5th star.",

We started at happy hour and tried a hand tossed American style pizza, did not care for the crust, the pizza was very dry. The fried green beans (happy hour $3) were very tasty. We were reluctant to order a full pizza, 2 of us staying at a neighboring hotel we knew we couldn't finish it. We decided to throw caution to the wind and order the square pan Detroit style pizza with extra sauce. Wow very rich and tasty. Crust held up to the extra sauce, loaded with cheese and tasty marinara. I'm sure there are other good pizza styles to order but I suggest don't waste your time on the American and go to the Detroit!",

Then finally once the first hostess was done talking to the couple in front of me they decided to talk.  I don't know it was strange, the server we got was great though and I feel bad as I can't remember his name. My husband and I shared a Cesar Salad, that we were going to get the family style option  but our server was nice enough to let us know that he didn't think that was necessary and to just get the single serving of the salad as it was big.  He was right, the single serving of salad for the 2 of us was the perfect amount, and it was really nice of the server to let us know that.  We then order the New Yorker, which I thought was out of this world, just something about the piping hot pizza and then getting a bite of the cool ricotta, I loved.  My husband thought it was just ok.  Regardless I'd go back the next time I was in Vegas.",

Draft beer was good and the service was excellent. Big tv's to watch the bowl games was really helpful, too.  We also ordered some gelato and mud pie for dessert. $100 for 7 people (before tip) not bad for Vegas. We would definitely go again the next time we are in Vegas.",

Several styles are presented (Italian, New York, Chicago thin, Sicilian, etc.) and  broken down by cooking method.  The menu also includes salads (very good and normally not a strength of a pizza place), burgers and some pasta dishes.  Atmosphere is fun and the service is exceptional and the funky downtown feel is enjoyable.  Definitely a go to place for a fun meal and great people watching.  Also a very good beer menu.

Very few restaraunts, however, combine all of these endearing - and essential - elements of a glorious Restaraunt-going experience, and Pizza Rock serves as a perfect example of how to provide a wonderful dining experience for anyone fortunate enough to pass through its' glass doors.  When you first walk into the Restaraunt, lovely attendants will gleefully offer you a seat and/or table. Whoever planned the interior decoration of this place excelled tremendously, as each nook, each cranny, each aspect of the interior exudes charm and jovial hospitality, combining modern hot-rod overtones of black and red with hints of Victorian furniture, replete withnew-York pizzareia tomato soup cans on every table. Hell, even the bathrooms have beautiful decorations -  I can only speak for the men's restroom, though  - and the traditional stickfigure gender identifiers  comically squirm and cover their nether regions in a desperate attempt to reach the restroom.  In particular with the compassionate staff, we received a waiter named Billy, and he's among the nicest waiters I have ever met. He always answered any questions we had, and knew how the pizzas we wanted were constructed, and his friendliness did not come off as forces or artificial: he genuinely loved, and continues to love, his job.   As for the food:  Oh.  My.  NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM!!!!  If you happen to visit Las Vegas or live in las Vegas, do yourself a favor and check out Pizza Rock. Give yourself a scrumptious, edible Christmas present.",

I worked years ago at a pizza joint, so I don't eat pizza often, but Pizza Rock compares favorably with Pop Up Pizza and Radio City Pizza, the two other \"pizza moderne\" places downtown. The pasta is good. It's a good place to get a beer or a drink after work, too. The one headache is that the music is a little loud if you meet for a working lunch or want to talk.",

Just earlier that day he had shared an elevator with someone holding a box of Pizza Rock pizza, which then sparked his cravings.  We finally found the spot and although they have a seating area, they also have a quick on-the-go ordering. The menu is very limited to a few pizzas.  Boyfriend ordered a slice of picante while I stuck with a plain pepperoni pizza. The slices are very New York style- thin crusted and HUGE pieces! When the employee was handing over our slices, the paper plate was too weak that the slices fell over LOL. Luckily I caught them with the plates but the employee was kind enough to give us replacements. We ended up with two extra slices for the next day.  Real good pizza & friendly people.",

Too much cheese, soggy dough. Meh. It was fine. The gluten free crust was good and the ingredients were fresh so that's positive. I'm a total pizza snob so maybe my standards are too high. The truffle fries were really good which is the reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2, which I still think is generous because really, I'm in Vegas, I should be able to get good fries lots of places. We did sit outside which was nice. I'm sure there's a better choice for pizza downtown though.",

This place has been compared to New York style pizza which I can't really comment on since I've never had it. What I can say is that this place is definitely a fun experience. When you walk in, you're greeted with the pizza bar where you can watch your pizza getting made. You can ask to get seated or seat yourself at the bar. They have this really great deal on late night happy hour after 10pm which is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I ordered truffle fries, some Molinari pizza, and I ordered a coconut drink that resembled a mojito ~ relish.  We sat ran in front of the big screen at the bar which plays music videos and in between features scenes from various movies. The place is very chill and I see myself coming back for dinner whenever I'm craving pizza and I'm in the downtown area.",

For drinks I ordered the Spicy Pomegranate Margarita that was recommended by our server. Great choice as I've never had anything like it. It also had a lavender salted rim.

The rockstar pizzaiolo's claim to fame here is that he makes something like a dozen different styles of pizza out of six or seven different types of ovens burning different materials at different temperatures.  I'm a firm believer though that it's extraordinarily difficult to do a lot of different things and be great at all of them. Howard Johnson was a utility player for the New York Mets in the late 1980s. He was a third baseman by trade, but also played shortstop, second base, left field and right field. He was a good third basemen. He was terrible in the outfield.  Basically what I'm getting at is that Tony Gemignani is the Howard Johnson of pizza. He does a few styles of pizza really well. And a few others ... well, he tries.  The best of the bunch, by a long shot, is the sausage and stout pizza, topped with fontina cheese and infused with Guinness in the crust. It's made in limited quantities each day and is worth getting there early for. The Detroit Red Top is like a Chicago deep dish on steroids - order one of these and you'll be eating it for a week.  Somewhat less successful is the New Yorker pie - an interpretation of a classic that just feels... off. Maybe he's trying to elevate it. But the whole point of New York pizza ... if you're elevating it, you're doing it wrong.",

They were happy to, no judgment, and it came out perfectly!  Also, we got the Garlic Green Bean appetizer (i'd skip it and just leave more room for the pizza) & for dessert we ordered their Tiramisu.

They have huge tv screens and are showing just about every game that is concurrently happening.    Unlike other sports bars, this place is smoke free and family-friendly, as they have a restaurant section away from the bar, too.  New restaurant.  Casual ambiance.",

    "text": "Delicious pizza, friendly service... and a DJ booth in a semi?! Located in the Downtown Fremont scene, this pizza joint is a great addition to the downtown scene. The ATMOSPHERE inside is dimly lit, TVs scattered around the restaurant, with just enough class and sophistication to go with the wonderful smells of the vegetarian, prosciutto and ricotta pizzas that our table had ordered.  Tonight I attended my boyfriend's holiday work party. We had a separate room and the SERVICE was great. Constantly checked on by the staff, waters were always refilled and the servers made sure that we had everything we needed on hand. I wish I remembered their names, but all three were welcoming enough.  I believe we had a prefixed menu for our holiday party FOOD, and seriously? It was sooo yummy! Even the appetizers. We started off with Caesar salads, meatballs and sauteed green beans. Being pescatarian, I had to pass on the meatballs but I heard they were quite filling and savory. Our entrees included four different types of pizzas: prosciutto, ricotta, vegetarian pan pizza and a meat pan pizza. I only tried the vegetarian pan pizza, which was enough for me. The vegetarian was cheesy and crunchy on the top and edges, layered on a fluffy tomato-saucy bread. I loved the pan pizza. It was so fluffy (and filling), I probably could have eaten half and used the rest as a pillow to sleep it off into a pizza oblivion. The slices were large portions and I was only able to eat two.   For dessert, we had apple empanadas served with vanilla bean ice cream, and some sort of chocolate ice cream mousse cake thing. Not quite sure what it was exactly, but it was a sweet ending to the meal and hit the right notes. Rock on! Now I really could have slept on the fluffy pillowy pizza at this point. Pricing, I believe ranges from $6+ per slice. For the overall experience, I would say it's worth it. Would come back again when I'm in the area and looking for another great pizza experience.",

    "text": "My husband follows a podcast group that had raved about this place.  We finally got to try it on this trip and it did not disappoint. It was so good we ate there twice in one day!    We stopped in a lunch for a quick slice at walk counter.  He slice was huge and also was very reasonably priced considering most food in Vegas is now on the higher end. The slice was less than what we would pay at a Mall type slice walk up counter.  And oh goodness was it good.  My husband ventured on the purple potato and lived it (which is surprising because he is usually a meat lovers type guy).  I had the pepperoni and it was delicious.  The slice held us over from our breakfast donut (at the nearby The Donut Bar - go there too!) until our fairly late night dinner at...Pizza Rock.    So after a full day of gambling and just a few drinks we stopped back in around 10pm for dinner.  It was great to find they had a late night happy hour menu.  Again with the happy hour aspect it was a great value.  We got more pizza and ordered one order of meatballs right off the bat.  So the truth is the meatballs came out just slightly warm.  They should have been hotter.  But after tasting them there was no way we could refrain from eating them all before the waitress came back by for us to even mention the temp issue.  By the time she came around (which wasn't long by the way) we had eaten them and our only complaint was that we needed more (and yes we ordered another order of them!!!!).  The sauce on them is so so so good.  My husband said he could put the sauce on a cup and just drink it it is that good.  Do not leave this place without getting the meatballs.  And seriously that's saying a lot as I am typically not a big meatball fan.    Our service was awesome and there was a personal touch as it turned out that our server was from a nearby town in our home state.  We were in and out quickly, and our drink cups were always full.  Great service.    We will be back!!!!",

And it's chill and hip for brunch on a Sunday early afternoon. But the most important thing...the pizza is fabulously tasty. The basic margherita pizza is a winner.

Here's the thing, I only ordered a very simple pie - cheese & pep - and loved every single bite. Sure did eat a regular sized pie all by myself. No shame. Judge me if you want to, but that pizza brought out my inner Ninja Turtle.  The beer slection was okie dokie... there are a few craft selections that I would've liked to see - but hey, it's Vegas and the craft beer scene is still developing. Plus side is that there were quite a few selections that I wasn't familiar with, so I got to try something new and enjoyed it!   The atmosphere was interesting... I found it enjoyable to watch the music videos and comedy sketches on the various screens located throughout the restaurant. Kind of noisy - so soft talkers may want to speak up. The decor was... all over, honestly. There's  a friggin semi truck front in there! I like how all of the staff has a rock/punk look & vibe.   \"Well if everything was so good and you enjoyed yourself, why not give it 5 stars?!\"   Firstly, I can't name this the best, yet. This may not be as good as it gets...that's the feeling it left me - fantastic, but maybe there's  phenomenal out there.   Secondly, the host stand kinda jacked that last star, man. There was a nice little crowd in Pizza Rock during our visit, so we were on a wait... no big. They asked for our number to text us when a table became available. About 20 minutes after our quoted wait, I watched two parties, who had arrived and gave their names after us (we were standing near the host stand the entire time) get seated before us. Maybe they had reservations...maybe they had checked in earlier... I wasn't  sure so we went up to ask about how much longer. Neither of the previous mentioned situations were the case - we had just been forgotten. Womp, womp. So be sure to keep an eye on the hosts or you'll  be standing around hungry with the scent of delicious pizza taunting you.  Maybe next time Pizza Rock can get that 5th star from me. :)",

We got the Cal Italia (Asiago, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Fig, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, & Balsamic) the first time, and the La Regina (Sopressata Picante, Proscuitto de Parma, Mozzarella, Provola, Parmaigiano, Piave, Arugula) the second. Both pizzas were really delicious. The La Regina is big, with a delicious thick crust; we shared one pizza between four of us and didn't quite finish it.   Fun atmosphere, great pizza, huge beer list -- I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Let's just say their staff and this includes their manager need some people skills. We went there one day for lunch to celebrate my co-workers birthday. We chose this spot because they have gluten free pizzas and my co-worker can't eat gluten. We arrive and the restaurant is semi busy but nothing crazy for St. Patty's day. We ordered three pizzas, one pepperoni pizza, one gluten free vegetarian pizza and a MARGHERITA pizza (one of the house specialties). First thing, the place wasn't busy. Let's make note of that. Secondly and this is a pet peeve of mines especially since I come from the hospitality industry, our server did not write our orders down. PEOPLE!!! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, UNLESS YOU HAVE OVER 10 YEARS OF RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE THEN YOU BETTER BE WRITING DOWN ORDERS. And here's why...first pizza out was the pepperoni, 10 mins later the vegetarian pizza comes out. 10 mins later, we're still waiting for our pizza. We flag down our server and tell him that our pizza has yet to arrive. Before even checking to see what the status was on our pizza he says it'll be out soon and that's due to the restaurant being busy. So we wait, and wait, and wait. The guys have already eaten their pizza and the vegetarian is about half way through and still nothing. We flag him down again and he goes to look and claims someone walked off with our pizza. Yeah right. Keep in mind, there is no sorry yet. So we ask to see a manager. She comes by claims that she was just told this and she will have it out soon. and she will comp it off the bill? Not a sorry or anywhere near it. Any good manager would know to always apologize to the guest after hearing how their staff messed up a table. We kept telling her that we've been waiting and the server hadn't really down a good job but all she kept saying was I was just told this. By this time yes the restaurant had picked up but there was no way our pizza would have been overlook had the server stayed on his tables. He would have seen that pizzas were missing and he should have gone to the kitchen and asked them right away what the status was on our food and then gone back to check on it.   On the plus side, food was delish and they had a semi truck inside the restaurant but with all that bad service that's not enough to encourage a visit anytime soon.",

We had the New Yorker and it was so freaking good I will be dreaming of this place when we go home.  The ingredients taste fresh and are plentiful.

The inside has plenty of seating too but we are loving this weather so we thought outside would be best for us.  I would eat here again and again if we lived here.",

The decor and atmosphere were casual with dim lights, DJ played rock music from a walled-in real truck (pretty cool) and multiple TV screens. There were four of us and we stopped in for a bite as it was late night and not too hungry. We ordered Downtown Pizza that has mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, and bacon. The portion is big and was cooked perfectly, not too salty.  The price is pretty decent for the portion.  The server was attentive and made sure the drinks were full. I will be back to try the other things on the menu.",

My friend had two pieces - vegetarian and a meat pizza. They have a walk-up window on the street, a counter where you can order a slice and sit inside and eat it (this is what we did) and they have a restaurant where you can sit. The service was great and so was the pizza. If you like a dry pizza (no oil) then this might not be for you, b ut it was the awesome crust and the olive oil that did it for me. Every once in a while - WTF! Screw the Calories! -  just eat a great slice of pizza. I was glad I did.   Note: it is an easy one block walk from the walking mall area in old town Las Vegas.   8/31/14",

I briefly looked it up when I checked in, but I mostly just went with the recommendation of my friend that suggested that we \"had\" to go to downtown to try it out.   We strolled in one Sunday afternoon and ordered the Margherita and the All Meat pizzas. Both pizzas were flavorful and fresh tasting, and the All Meat was presented without having a lot of grease that one might expect with an All Meat pizza. This spot would definitely worth coming back if in the area with a craving for pizza and a great ambience.",

They have a great selection of rock songs playing in the background.  Dark decor to fit the theme.  And wonderful service.  Even though there is a place in SF, I'll still go to Pizza Rock again next time I'm in  Vegas because it was such a great experience.  Bonus the Vegas location is cheaper.",

Eight of us came to celebrate a friend's birthday, but it wasn't a great place to talk to everyone and catch up. We were literally yelling just to talk to person next to us. I think by the end of the meal we all gave up on talking to each other and just stared at the TVs playing music videos instead. In general the whole restaurant is very loud, but I think we were directly under a speaker, making it even worse. On the plus side, they were at least playing good music!    As for the food, the pizza was just \"meh\".  Five of us split the mob boss, which is a Sicilian style pizza. The menu said serves up to 5 people and it did for us girls, but if you're really hungry, I would say it's good for more like 3 people. The pizza comes in a big rectangular pan and has super thick crust. I feel like too many pieces had more crust than topping which was disappointing.   This place has just about every style of pizza one could dream of, so I'd be willing to try another kind. I'm sure there's got to be better pizzas than the Sicilian on the menu.",

I'm sure when some TV celebrity chef shows up with a film crew for a scheduled visit, the #1 cook prepares the food using the best super fresh ingredients possible. The resulting rating is often much better than what the man off the street is served. Not the case here. We ordered the award winning 16 inch New Yorker pizza...a slightly charred crust from a 700 degree oven topped with house made fennel sausage, a tasty pepperoni, mozzarella, garlic, a slightly sweet house made red sauce, and small dabs of cool ricotta. The sweetness of the sauce balanced perfectly with the spicy sausage and yielded a truly memorable pie. The fun, friendly service ( it's always fun to have a playfully humorous server ) added to our pizza experience. This pie is more than deserving of it's many accolades and will beckon us back every time we get a pizza craving.  Mar. 2018- We had to return based on the quality of our previous meal. Consistency is so important if a five star rating is to be rendered. The New Yorker Pie again performed to our expectations. One of our all time favorites.",

    "text": "I took 18 employees to lunch. My review is more focused on the group event than the foodie details.  We used their event room, which seats about 20 and has a big screen TV on one end. It's basically a rectangular space with two long tables open to the restaurant on one side. The TV is a distraction when you're having an event, but if it's turned off, the room might seem dark.  We left it on.  I made my reservation two days prior with Maddie, who handled it professionally. I received a confirmation call several hours ahead of our reservation, which was helpful. I didn't like that they won't allow you to submit your order in advance, even for a large group. I recommend allowing it if the client applies a deposit to ensure they show. I also think it would be great if they emailed group ordering suggestions in advance.  They do have pre-fix options for groups of 25 or larger.   I don't recommend taking a large group and just handing everyone a menu. When you take a horde somewhere, it helps to understand serving sizes and get recommendations. Unfortunately, their website was down on the day of the event, so I was operating blind. Hooray for Yelp!, where I found a partial menu, but the descriptions were inadequate for determining serving sizes.   If you're ordering pizza baked to order, there's no opportunity to quickly add pies if you come up short. I ordered seven 16-inch pizzas (mix of New Yorker, Michigan Ave and Frank Nitti). We also had 4 orders of garlic bread (6 large pieces) and four large salads that were shared. Garlic bread, salad and drinks kept everyone occupied until the pies arrived. Generally, their 13\" pies serve two, 16\" three and Giant Sicilian five. Specific pizzas only come in specific sizes, so pay attention.  The hostess greeting was lukewarm, but as soon as we were seated in the room, Summer (manager?) greeted me and discussed our needs. She reassured me my order was adequate to feed everyone and worked with my vegan colleague to help her understand meal options. Our servers were attentive, ensuring everyone's drinks were filled. The room was crowded, so there was a certain amount of passing things down, but that builds camaraderie.  Overall, good food, good service, good atmosphere and a satisfied client. Pricier than some competitors, but part of what you're paying for is the experience (there's a semi-truck in the dining room and you're in a tourist corridor). After tax and tip, we spent about $22 per person (no alcoholic beverages) and took about one pizza worth of food away in a box. There are opportunities to improve advance coordination for large groups. We would visit again.",

We also got a pizza with half pepperoni and half Americano. The pepperoni was basic but was still good.  And the Americano looked overwhelming at first with all the cherry tomatoes on it, but it was absolutely delicious! For 3 people, we got two pizzas and still had a few slices leftover to take home. Will have to come back to try all the other yummy items on the menu.   Word to the wise, prepare yourself for the traffic surrounding the area since it is close to all the Fremont street craziness.  We did valet at the parking garage across the street from the restaurant to the right (they work on tips). Or you can park your car and get your ticket validated at the restaurant.",

I've tried several pizzas here and I have to say that the crust is amazing on all of them,  no matter which kind you get.   They have a variety of appetizers,  and some main dishes if you aren't interested in pizza.  I recommend the meatballs if you're looking for a quick bite.    The thing I'm most happy about is the Beer list.  Pizza and Beer are just meant to go together,  and with such a variety in their pizza,  they need to have a variety in their beer... and boy do they! So many great brews on draft,  and an excellent bottle selection.    One thing about this location I would change is the dining room ambiance.  The Bar is... Ok,  but the dining room feels like you're in a cheap food court,  and believe me this isn't cheap pizza.",

Started out with an appetizer (not on the online menu) - it was fried dough with burrata and crispy prosciutto. Holy heck was this amazing. I could have eaten three orders of this myself and been happy. But then the pizza arrived and it was the Sausage Stout Pizza (Honey Malted Dough Made with Stout Beer, Fresh Mozzarella, House Made Beer Sausage, Caramelized Onions, Fontina, Green Onions, Crushed Red Peppers, Beer Salt & a Sweet Stout Beer Reduction). And WOW if you thought the description was good the execution was even better. Glad to have found this place and if I am ever back in Las Vegas you can be sure I will be back here.",

They have happy hour from 10p-2a, so I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else for food on Fremont. The hosts up front would not acknowledge me and my two friends, it was oddly difficult to get a table at midnight even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  My friend ordered a calzone and when they brought it out, they apologized all of the toppings went to one side and the other half was just an empty hole. They allowed her to still eat the other half while they made a new one. Colin came by and said 5 minutes and the new one is ready. He then came back 10 minutes later and apologized they burned her calzone so now they're making another new one. My friend asked for it to-go, as we've now been eating and drinking for 45 minutes and we were ready to leave. Colin came back again, said 5 more minutes, and then returned 10 minutes later and said he comped her food and her drinks due to the calzone issue. 15 minutes later she got the calzone to go and it was all on the house.  If it wasn't for Colin continually checking on us and giving us an update, it would definitely of kept the 4 stars. I had a personal size happy hour pizza and it was delish! My other friend order a Carmel Apple martini, which was way too strong for her, but all of our food and drinks tasted great.",

My first visit was a planned luncheon with a few business associates, the second visit was to enjoy the late night pizzeria option they run after normal business hours. Located in a section of town where the alcohol flow-rate exceeds the measurable annual rainfall totals makes these types of restaurants welcoming places of refuge after spending the night getting the \"Fremont\" experience on and the line out the door validates this type of business model is a no-brainer.  Well you don't comes here only because you've tried to consume all the beer and all the generous pours of alcohol from the vendors lining Fremont Street or if you've participated in the legal cannabis craze. They do stand pretty tall when it comes to food quality and options here and the service was outstanding during both of my visits. The house salad with their house dressing is pretty special I'd recommend it with any order - I also tried the meatballs on a sub roll and also as an appetizer they are definitely something to consider and in regards to the late night pizzeria options this pizza definitely elevates their notoriety. The re-heat is executed perfectly but in actuality the number of customers turned here late night keeps the pizzas moving from the oven to the plate and I saw nothing that appeared to be aging past it's prime...",

Definitely earning their tips here ;)  The house salad was a generous portion but almost all of it was lettuce and other greens. We expected a bit more tomatoes and onions etc.  The pizza was the star of the dinner. The crust was just perfect. You can most definitely notice the 900 degrees oven. Just great. The tomato sauce can be improved a bit though.  For dessert we ordered the mud pie. It was delicious. Quite similar to the cheesecake factory cakes (it's a rather heavy cake).",

The location is great, the ambiance is cool, the service is on point and the food... Our bill was pretty high because there were four of us and we all ordered different stuff so we could try as much as possible. Everything that was delivered to us was outstanding. The pizza crust was crispy, but chewy, which is the only way to be as a pizza crust. The toppings were plentiful and had their own distinct flavors. We have sent out of town friends there when they have asked for pizza recommendations in town and they have all raved about it. Unless you site Domino's pizza as your favorite pizza, which indicates that you have the palate of a toddler, you will find something you love at this restaurant.",

Pizza rock came recommended by our Uber driver, it also sounded delicious, and sure enough as we walk towards the doors I get that quintessential pizza parlor smell that comes wafting at me! The perfect smell of the best parlor pizza is awaiting inside!!

The mix of basalmic and Asiago was a perfect mix with prosciutto ham on top! Wow!!!  However we wanted to try the red sauce, so we had a side to dip our crust in ... straight from the hot stove with great taste. True to a red sauce but not too tomatoey.    Add the great flavors to a good atmosphere, peppy music, and friendly/welcoming/knowledgeable staff and it was a great dinner experience.  Staying across the street we plan to come back and try the red sauce ... maybe in a calzone.",

Can we try them all? If only my stomach would let me! They have all different types of crusts and pizzas that are typical to specific regions, such as Chicago or Detroit style. They have both thin and thick crusts. So many to pick from. Ultimately decided to go for the New Yorker (how typical being that we are from that area?). It was so so so so good - I seriously can't say enough good things about it. Between the dollops of ricotta cheese, sausage and pepperoni, just a perfect combination of everything good about pizza. I've been back from Vegas for over a month now and I'm still thinking about Pizza Rock. If they ever made a location on the east coast, it would be my go to!",

    "text": "So recently checked this place out during a friends birthday celebration. I was impressed walking up to the front on how much the area has been developed for the better with the addition of nicer restaurants and infrastructure.   Once you come in, there is a pizza by the slice bar area for a grab and go and is also the waiting area for seating at the bar and dining. I found this area to be very hectic as expected on a Friday afternoon but still slightly confusing.   However, once seated, things were amazing. The food was by far AMAZING. The pizza had a great taste. Our wait staff did well in taking care of guests even with the place being busy.  One note, parking can be challenging but there is pay parking 1 to 2 blocks away which was easier to park at vs. trying to use casino parking.   In conclusion as downtown continues to bring in nice places to eat, Pizza Rock is a great place to try.",

    "text": "You can do pizza on just about every corner in Las Vegas, but I was told that this pizza rock is the stuff to get. So I head on over to the mothership with promises that I won't be disappointed.  The line for pizza slices is a mile long and the kid working the counter has an attitude that's equally as long (for what reason I'm not certain? I overhear a lady who also is annoyed by this guy tell her hubby \"If you don't like making pizzas, then maybe you should try and do something else with your life!\") Ok, maybe he's having a bad day but we're off to a bad start. With this in mind we opt for a table. The restaurant is basically empty, but that's not going to deter us because it is early.  Service is a little off, and we seem to be annoying everybody at the restaurant? I can't understand it, but again I'm told this pizza is the stuff so I decide we're going to stick it out (should I be sorry?) Finally a waitress comes over and takes our order and from that point and she's very attentive. The kitchen also has runners who will bring your food out to you to ensure it's hot.  We order up two pizzas and an order of meatballs. Truth be told, we probably ordered enough food for five people! There are only two of us and we did the best we could. Found the meatballs to be really good, the Chicago pizza is fantastic, and the margarita pizza should be passed on. They also have like 100 beers on tap, so if that's your thing you're at the right place.  So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes/no  Return? Yes/no  Advocate? Yes/no",

We decided to go off the strip and visit this place in-person. I love Detroit pizza so we ordered the Detroit red top. The edge of the crust had burnt cheese which was just divine. Ample cheese and a rich red sauce on top with jus the right crunch on the outside. Very authentic and very tasty. We finished the whole pie with ease. The beer list was extensive, but I tried the founders green zebra. Very good sour beer, almost like having green apple candy. Service was somewhat slow but 5/5 for a delicious pie.",

Pizza is soggy, I cannot lift a slice to my mouth. I Decide to heat a few slices up in the oven and voila!!!!Pizza is awesome!!!!  But... I'd rather you cook the pizza cook for  2 minutes more  than the delivery guy showing up 2 minutes earlier....  Another issue, the wings 14  dollar wings are small Tyson wingettes, and I asked for hot and got a bland sauce. Bbq would have been spicier. And more flavorful. Like why was there even a choice of heat if it never even mattered?   But then there  were the fried artichokes.     Wow they were so good definitely the prodigy player of the team.   Solid 3. Pizza was great after I had to cook it longer, but I shouldnt have to do that and those wings were pretty bad.   Very disappointed because of the good reviews but maybe it was a busy night so maybe they weren't at their best. Honestly,  I'd probably give them another chance if only for the fried artichokes alone.",

Grabbed a slice to go, everything looked promising.  The young lady put it in the oven to warm it up and crisp that crust a little more.  Handed it to me in a box and off I went.  Opened up the box, pulled out that delicious looking slice and it literally fell apart.  I'm not talking the toppings slid off, I'm talking pulled apart at the center.  Crust was super soggy and not thoroughly cooked.  Easily the most disappointing thing I've tried to eat in Vegas this year.  Ended up fork eating the cheese and topping which were just ok.

We ordered the beer battered artichokes, which were DELISH by the way, and the Verdura veggie pizza that we added pepperoni to, which was also DELISH!  The artichokes were served with a spicy dipping sauce that gave the perfectly fried appetizer just the right amount of kick.  The pizza was flavorful and had a yummy crunchy crust. The food is delicious, and definitely worth 5 stars, but sadly the service is majorly lacking at this restaurant.  The restaurant was either understaffed or our server was slow.  Maybe a combo of both, as she also lacked the soft skills that you really need to have in the restaurant industry.   All in all great food, and definitely worth a return visit.",

At the end, we had an issue, And not to pull the, \"customer is always right\" card, but I complained as people should if they feel there is a reasonable cause. I approached the manager and was nice until I explained my issue. She immediately gave attitude, walked over to the server and instead of just handling it like you would think a professional manager would, she took my bill and stormed off into the kitchen. Honestly trying to find a reason why it was my fault. It wasn't. They messed up, plain and simple. After, the server was incredibly sweet and asked me what she could do to make me happy, I said anything would be great! She gave me a discount and NOT TO MY SURPRISE, the manager never came back out to speak to me or apologize or offer anything. She stayed in the back and, which I can only assume, throwing a fit. Not likely to return, which I'm sure will make her happy.",

I found the exact kind of pizza I was craving by listening to his descriptions of each type. I had a real Italian style pizza with that delicious thin crust that needs to be folded in order to be eaten, covered in fresh cheese and meats. The charcuterie on my pizza was perfect. I don't know if I am a fan of their salads, but who needs a salad when they have such amazing pizza. The staff is very attentive and want you to enjoy your experience at the restaurant. I came in here for lunch, so I only know the noon ambiance is very relaxed. The place itself was not too dark like in other sports bar-like restaurants. I really enjoyed that for that time of the day.",

That's right, if you are seated in the dining room you have to get up and go purchase your pizza slice. Your only other lunch options are burgers (I'm not ordering a burger at a pizza joint), meatball sub, Italian sandwich or chicken sandwich. So... Bring a large group, or don't bother. Your lunch options are salad, one of three sandwiches, a burger or walk up and get your own food.   What's ridiculous... They have a happy hour menu with personal sized pizzas. But it's only after 3pm.  Why not make it a lunch. Is the food good? Who cares. Stupid restaurant. Stupid employees. I ordered iced tea. My buddy ordered water. The girl had a 50/50 shot at getting it right. She failed.   Am I supposed to tip if I have to go get my own food?   What a joke.",

It has a very cool vibe, the customer service is excellent and of course, the most important part, the pizza is DELICIOUS! One of my sisters works here now so hopefully next time I come out I can get a discount! :D Definitely stop by if you're visiting and looking for some delicious pizza at a great price!",

    "text": "We are a group of locals who meet once per month to explore the culinary creations available to us. On this occasion 5 couples met at Pizza Rock on a Saturday night with reservations. There was a short wait and then we were seated and waited on promptly.  Looking over the drink menu, it did not include any prices for the beer or wine. There was a short selection of white and red wine by the glass or bottle but the waiter did not know anything about the bottles offered. I took a chance and ordered The Dreaming Tree after the waiter brought over a little taste. I enjoyed the wine but would loved more variety and at the very least prices.  The menu is vast and yet specific. Pizza Rock knows pizza, the flavor and how to do it well. Our group tried all varieties (900, 600 and 550 degree oven).  The service was attentive and enthusiastic. I had the Gorgonzola salad and it is big enough for two.  We would come back here as a family (small children) or with our friends. An excellent place for pizza that rivals Settebello VPN. Could be improved to a five star with additional wine options and the mentioned prices on the menu.",

    "text": "This is definitely not a typical pizza place- if you just want a plain traditional pizza, go somewhere else.  So far I've tried three different pizzas, and each one is better than the next.    Must try: ~Honey Pie- savory pizza with honey on it- trust me! ~Romana III Pizza- this one is a mix of a proscuitto and tomato, ground beef, and NUTELLA- all on a different third of the pizza.  The ingredients don't touch, so don't be grossed out.  The Nutella/Gorgonzola is life altering good.  You have to ask for extra nutella on it.  ~Salumi and Formaggio Board- you can build your own sandwich.   Good but not amazing: ~Caesar salad- comes with whole anchovies on top, and kind of pricey considering it's just a caesar salad. ~Meatball appetizer- skip it and just save room for the honey pie.   Other: Sometimes does Groupon deals, and no more valet parking in front.  You can park in the Grand's garage that's kitty corner, and they validate parking.",

    "text": "I really wish I could give this place a higher star rating but perhaps I will be back another time to change it.  It wasn't that the food as bad, although my meatball sub came out lukewarm, it wasn't the bad service even though I got the sense the waitress wasn't thrilled to have to wait on a table that had three younger children, it was the process in which the food was delivered and the awkwardness of watching everyone else at other tables who came in after us got served first.  All we ordered was one meatball sub, one order of mac and cheese, one p, b and j pizza from the kids meal (which was oddly a cheese pizza with peanut butter and jelly) and one cheese roll.    The food took forever to come, and it came one thing at a time, really slowly.  First the mac and cheese for one of my sons, then the pizza, then the cheese roll, and then 5 minutes later my meatball sub.  The fact that it was lukewarm probably says that it was actually sitting there waiting for someone to get it.    This sounds like a discombobulated communication error on the side of the kitchen staff and the runners/waitstaff.  I did get 20% off for checking in, but overall I was left less than impressed.  Perhaps I will give it another chance, or perhaps I will just stick with my standbys and let the Zappos folk flock to it and be catered to since it's hip for them.",

We are all blown away on how amazing our pizzas tasted. My wife and I shared the New Yorker based on our servers recommendation being 1st timers. Man, he hit out of the park with that one. My friends chose to do ham and pineapple which was also great. I recommend anyone strolling around downtown to give this place a try. Im confident you will not be disappointed.",

We started with the fried green beans which were garlicky perfection.  Our newly vegetarianish teenager ordered the Brooklyn Calzone and was thrilled to have enough for lunch the next day.  We split a Cal Italia and it's easy to see why it was Food Network some sort of challenge Gold Medal Winner: Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a Balsamic Reduction.  Perfection!  They also have a great sangria that I could've drank pitchers of if I wasn't the designated driver that day.",

Fried Calamari to start. They have a great wine selection and outstanding craft beer list. It can be a little loud with music but it is called pizza ROCK. good group areas. The staff id quick and know their stuff. If it's the weekend either come early or make a reservation. It id off the main Fremont area but easy to access. As a Vegas Lifer it is nice to see what Downtown has become. Check this place out it will not disappoint.",

    "text": "Delightful lunch today with a charming wait person named Billy. After learning I favored IPAs he recommended a tap beer with nitro. No idea what nitro is but liking the sound of it, I ordered. Delicious, nice foamy head with a crisp flavor. The pizza Napoletana I ordered was equally terrific with an ultra thin, slightly charred crust. Could this dining experience be improved upon? Absolutely and this is why:    When I was ready to pay I discovered my wallet was not in my purse. Panic struck, I explained the problem to Billy.  He immediately set my mind at ease by speaking with his manager. She was very gracious, took care of my bill with no questions asked and offered to help me locate the missing wallet. As it turns out, a cabbie had called the restaurant to report a lost item. He didn't leave his name or cab details however. The manager, whose name I didn't learn, set out to call all of the cab companies who may have driven me to Pizza Rock. Long story short, the cab company was discovered, the driver identified, the wallet returned to me at the restaurant. In the interim - Billy offered to spot me money to get by in case the wallet wasn't found. The manager also offered to give me money to get back to my hotel. Once I had my wallet back, I tried to pay my bill.  Get this, they wouldn't let me.  Will I recommend Pizza Rock to friends and family? Without a doubt.    Thank you, Billy and your manager, for reaffirming my belief that people are good.",

We ordered a lot of food seeing that we were having a bachelor party dinner. So we ordered two New Yorkers and a downtown. The downtown had a ton of peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes and sausage. Have to say it was some of the best pie I've had outside the east coast.  Surprisingly great beer selections, double IPAS down to Hamms. 8 guys ate and had a few beers for 240 bucks. Not bad at all and well worth it.",

Very upset they discontinued my favorite beer La Fin Du Monde, however twice now on a $25 pie I was disappointed so I'll have to find another place.",

Toppings can be everyday or truly imaginative. We tried five or six different pizzas and they were all great. Ordered way too much food because their portions are large which explains the prices of the pizzas which are meant to be shared. Appetizers were good but I have to say the Caesar salad was a bit so so and could have used more dressing--my fault for not asking though. We were a large group of 13 and our waitress, Sarah, handled us with ease and grace. The place has a rock vibe of course with a cool bar and retros videos playing everywhere. So we will definitely come back again next time we are in LV!",

Got a seat near the bar area and was surprised to see that they actually had live entertainment during brunch and they ROCKED!  Ordered from the special brunch menu and of course got the unlimited sangria and the quail egg pizza. Sangria was good and after a couple I was feeling great! The pizza is absolutely delicious, enjoyed every bite!  This is a really cool place to go for an alternative type Sunday brunch setting, the food is Great, the drinks are priced right and the live acoustic guys that were playing really added to the Pizza \"ROCK\" experience, playing great songs from a lot of different genres!  I will definitely be back with friends to party on Sunday afternoons!",

Also had the Detroit Topper which helped recover the meal.  There are better values for pizza in Vegas IMO (try Grimaldis)",

I'm local so I don't go to Freemont often and haven't been in years.  To my surprise this place was nice.  The customer service was really good and the drinks....... let me just say one drink and I was feeling it.  I couldn't complian because some place water down the drinks in order to get you to keep ordering. So on to the pizza, my husband is pretty simple so we had a basic hamburger and cheese and let me tell you this was the best that I have had in Las Vegas.  I want to go today just to order a pizza to go.   It was so delicious and I ate almost 3 pieces and had 2 drinks.  It was just the two of us so we just ordered a 12 inch and it was more than enough for the both of us.  My husband went on a weekend for a guys night and he said that they have a live dj.  They didn't have it on a Tuesday night, but the food was amazing.  The server was attentive and nice and the environment was nice. Oh yeah so we sat at a nice intimate table for two:-) all in all date night was a success.   We will be back maybe even tonight because the pizza is just so yummy.",

Since this restaurant had a 1-1/2 hour wait, we decided to get slices of pizza to go and hunt down a place with frozen drinks. We waited 30 mins for pizza by the slice. I got the Vegi pizza and my friend the pepperoni pizza. My friend indicated it was the best pizza she has ever had. Not sure how mine's could tasted...read on....It had potential..really it did!!! I was disappointment by the staff behind the counter. We were getting it to go and they had flimsy plates to carry it out on. After seeing a huge pile of to go boxes that another of the staff had made up, the man helping us said he had NO boxes... \"Really.\" I said. \"Then what is that behind you.\" Reluctantly, he put my friend's pizza in a box, but not mines. He said he could not give any more boxes away. WHAT?!   I was really bummed I had to carry it outside with the pizza slice lopping over the side of the flimsy plate. I lost half my toppings on the ground. I ended up folding my plate in half to keeping the remaining topping from falling off. I bet this pizza was good, but I will never know to what extent it was good. But hey, after we found the margaritas and enjoyed the concert all was good!  I know their restaurant is excellent. I will be back to eat there on the next concert outing!  However, staff behind the To Go counter needs to be schooled in the art of customer service and the To Go counter should have better quality plates to hold up their awesome pizza. Come on Pizza Rock...you can do it! Rock on!",

The calamari is delicious.  I don't know why I keep ordering the garlic bread because every time I get it, it is a little bland, and there is no salt to be found on the table...ugh.  The best part of the meal on Saturday night was the service by Sommer!  She was, far and away, the best server I've had in years...anywhere!  She was five-star service all the way, and she explained everything thoroughly.  I need a copy of the weekly staff schedule so I can come in and sit with Sommer every time!!!!  She is spectacular!    And Pizza Rock plays the best music!",

    "text": "I hate to be a party pooper, but I just don't get the hype. I came here with extremely high expectations, and I was seriously let down. Not just once, but on a few occasions.  On my first visit, I had their \"World Pizza Cup Winner in Naples\" Margherita Pizza (San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO). I've had some good pizza in my life, but I don't recall ever having an award winning one. Damn, this must be the ish. This was music to my belly and food porn to my eyes. I literally couldn't wait to make love...err...to get my hands and mouth on this pizza. Well, that was about all the foreplay I got out of this as it quickly went downhill once I bit into it. For one, this award winning pizza was not dried enough when it got off the boat from its Italy trip. It was extremely watery and extremely doughy. I mentioned this to our waiter, and he replied with, \"that's the way it's supposed to be.\" Okay, I'm Italian, however, I am not an \"award winning\" cook, therefore, perhaps I just don't know what the pizza is supposed to be like. I don't know, maybe it was just me, but I really didn't like how doughy and watery it was so I just left it there.  We also ordered their Classic Meatballs (Smothered in Marinara) and Garlic-Garlic Bread (House Made Ciabatta with Mozzarella, Pecorino Romano and Oregano). The meatballs were extremely salty. They weren't terrible, however, I'd prefer they hold the salt a bit...okay lot. Their garlic bread was pretty darn good and was about the only highlight during our visit.  The second time we went there, we got The New Yorker (Winner of \"Best Traditional Pizza in the World\"at the Las Vegas Pizza Expo). Perhaps their award winning traditional pizza would be a hit with me. Nope! Nada! Zero! Not at all. This one was overcooked, and I don't mean slightly, I mean this pizza was burnt. It wasn't pleasant to bite into it. Once again I just left my pizza there. Man, these folks went from one extreme to another, from too watery and doughy to burnt.  Since I really wanted to like this place, we came back for a third time hoping that this one would be the charm. Frankly, I don't remember what I ordered this time, but I do remember getting a \"non award\" winning pizza. Well, once again it was underwhelming and the only thing that I enjoyed was the meatballs and garlic bread. However, what I do recall is that this time my pizza was just flavorless.  I probably won't be back unless I'm in that side of town and I'm in the mood for some good garlic bread.",

    "text": "On Saturday before Life is Beautiful, we decided to come here and watch college football. The bar had plenty of seating so we grabbed some seats and ordered drinks. Our bartender was nice enough to accommodate our request for the Spartans game.  Onto the menu! They have a nice beer selection, and the menu for pizza is huge. It's divided into all these different styles. There's really no small, medium, large. Each style of pizza comes in a set size.   We picked the New Yorker, which I would say feeds about 3 people. I wanted to order more things, but the BF knew my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach, and plus we didn't have anywhere to store leftovers as we were going to the festival after. Good call because I was stuffed. Anyway, OMG, this pizza was SOOOO GOOD!  I think it was pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, fresh mozzerella, and little dollops of ricotta on a thin chewy crust. Everything about this pizza was amazing. In fact, I think I even said, \"This might be the best pizza I've ever eaten.\"   When I came to Pizza Rock for the Yelp Elite event, I have to say I was not that impressed. It's probably because they weren't prepared for how many people were there and everything was just chaos and the food wasn't prepared as well. Who knows. All I know is this time around the pizza was on point!  My only complaint is that the drinks are so expensive. $12 for a Moscow Mule? Aren't we downtown at a pizza joint? I guess that's downtown prices now. Either way, I can't WAIT to go back and get more pizza!  Also, they serve by the slice at the window by the entrance.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this by saying that I am originally from New York City. Anyone who knows anything about the legendary rivalry between New York and Chicago when it comes to pizza knows that it goes much, much deeper than that. Pizza sauce runs in my veins. I have been called (and rightfully so), a pizza snob.  Having said that, Pizza Rock has some of the best pizza I've ever had. In my life. It was even better than any pizza I had when I lived in Italy. The fresh ingredients and the special oven(s) make their food taste like heaven. The crust..... I could write long paragraphs about the texture of the crust alone, about the crisp crunch when you first bite into it, followed by the chewy texture, but I won't go on about that.   I will tell you that my favorite pizza is the New York. Ha ha. No, really. It's amazing! At first I thought it was strange that they put little dollops of fresh ricotta cheese on it after it is baked, and I was taken aback. Just a little. But darn if it didn't grow on me, fast. They've ruined me now for all other pizza places.   I have not tried the pastas yet, but I will. Also, I like the place. It is rather large inside, but somehow manages to feel intimate. A good place to gather with friends and family. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. Beer selection (and I'm not really a beer girl, but I'm learning) is not too shabby either. Really good experiences each time I've been there.",

The menu is huge, so many different types and styles of pizza.  It can be almost overwhelming trying to pick.  I got the Brooklyn Calzone deep fried and the kiddos all got kids meals (mac n cheese, spaghetti and meatballs and pepperoni pizza).  I choose the calzone because I had never heard of one deep fried before.  The filling was good but I wouldn't pick deep fried again.  The crust was very thin and crunchy.  Not what I was expecting.  Glad I tried something new though.  All the kids meal were very good and included a drink.  They were large portions and could have been shared.  My kids never want the same thing though.  They give the kids crayons to color and draw.  That's nice to keep them busy.  Service was great and they were packed.   Def a great family friendly place downtown.",

We went on a Friday afternoon because of an early bedtime for our daughter and had no problem getting a table. we tried 2 different beers and even enjoyed the Fried Green Tomato app. I would literally go there just got that app.   The New Yorker (pizza) was amazing and our daughter enjoyed her kids meal. We also couldn't resist the Mud Pie.   The service was the issue, our server was close to his time off and your could tell he was rushing us with our order and even our meal. He wasn't very nice, made up excuses when he forgot our drink refills (and our appetizer) and even counted his tips in front of us. Piece of advice for you... counting your tips in front of your table will more than likely lower the tip that you are about to get from said table. And in this case, it totally did.",

I noticed they will have another location soon in Henderson in Green Valley Ranch Casino. I will frequent both of these spots. The slices are NY quality, with the crust hard enough to fold at the crust...without the middle flopping back down to your plate.  There is no major oil runoff.  The cheese is not overflowing.  Toppings are fresh and delicious.  You're probably saying to yourself \"If he's saying how great the food is...why did he give it only 4 stars?\".  Here is why...  THE PRICES!! C'mon Pizza Rock!! I know you guys know you have a great product, so you're charging $4 for a slice of pizza?? $6 for a veggie slice?? That's absolutely bonkers and it makes me mad!! No reason why I should order 3 slices of pizza and a water...and it total $17!!! If you want to mimic a product from NYC, please go do some research and look at their pricing...because I'm sure that their store rental is more expensive than Vegas real estate...and they prosper just fine.  You have a great product, and its a great floor space.  Love the dark colors, the decor, and the friendly staff.  Hate those prices.",

This makes the quality stand out above all other places I've tried. The pepperoni and sausage are home made and of course the sauce. The pizza crust is crunchy yet chewy; essentially perfect. Even the croutons were a cut above!! It's a fun atmosphere,too. The first time we went on a whim of mine at midnight and the VJay was playing all my favorite 80's and 90's cuts on the big screens adorning the room. Today the music was a little more mellow and the screens were showing sports events instead of music videos. Perfect for Sunday afternoon. I'll definitely plan to come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

We started by ordering two Martinis, a #Basic Martini and the Soulless Martini. Soulless tasted like straight rubbing alcohol and #Basic tasted like that terrible aftertaste you get in your mouth after taking NyQuil before bed.  All bad.  So we asked them to exchange them for the Coconut Cooler and the Pomegranate Margarita. Both were much better thank god.  I ordered a Margarita Pizza, which is one of my favorites types of pizza when done right. What I got was a serious disappointment.   You couldn't even taste the basil, nor did it have olive oil drizzled over the top like it should and the amount of fresh mozzarella was lacking  and there was no fresh sliced tomatoes layered on top.   For $17.00 I expected to be blown away. We could've stayed in a ordered a decent pizza for delivery for less than that.",

It was just enough for two people and we didn't have leftovers. The dough had great beer flavor and their house made sausage was outstanding.  Service was also very good tonight.  We will be back to order this again!",

Decor is edgy with a flare.  Located just a block off Fremont, it's one of the better places to eat downtown.    We were greeted and seated immediately  .Our service here was great.  Our waitress had an upbeat personality making it a pleasure to dine here.  It was during happy hour so we started with the $3 appetizers of meatballs and Gorgonzola fries.  The meatballs are huge with great herbs and spices making these a win.  The Gorgonzola fries did not fall short either.  The creamy cheese drenched the fries with cheese crumbles also on top.  Both appetizers were delicious and would order again.    For our pizza choice we went with the Diavola.  It was topped with sopressata, hot red pepper oil, parmigiano-reggiano and arugula.  We chose to leave the arugula off.  This wasn't my favorite. I thought it would be a little more spicy but it was ok.    As far as pizza places go, it's one of my favorites and I can't wait for the new location at GVR to open!",

    "text": "There's pizza and rock music, and a semi tractor inside!  The interior is fairly dark, the truck looks cool (and somehow seems appropriate) but you won't care about the truck while you're enjoying some incredible pizza.  I've been here easily a half a dozen times, took friends in for lunch today, and finally had the presence of mind to check in.  This is my favorite pizza place when I'm in a pizza mood and can get downtown.  So here we go...  You enter right at the corner of N. 3rd St and E. Ogden Ave.   As you walk in, you're greeted by a cool host team always ready to take care of you, no matter how busy the place is.  If you need to wait, there are chairs, or if you're going to be in and out, there's a pizza bar to your right.  Every time I've been there, the place is fairly full (except for the time I arrived very shortly after the doors opened for the day).  I've only made a reservation once, but honestly, I recommend it if you want to be sure you'll get a seat or you have a schedule to keep.  Since they've put the option to make a reservation right on their webpage, it's probably a good idea.  Fast and easy...just do it.  The pizzas:  They're made fresh and they can take a little time to come out, so plan accordingly.  It's never been an excessive wait though.  There's pretty much a pizza on the menu for everyone, so read through it.  It's not a lengthy menu, but there are a surprising number of options.  The price will seem a little high if you're used to fast food pizza, but your taste buds will thank you for spending a little extra for a gourmet pie.  The rock:  The playlist is long enough that you won't wonder why you're hearing that same song again, and the variety is great.  You'll hear current and classic rock, and they've even snuck a little country in there now and then.  The volume is a bit louder than most places with background music though, but it's not so loud as to be annoying.  If you're looking for an intimate and quiet setting though, you may want to look elsewhere for that lunch or dinner and come to Pizza Rock when you want to enjoy the food and the music.  Don't worry, you can still have a conversation with your friends, but the music will be there to accompany you.  Speaking of intimate, most of the tables are set to seat small groups and they're done in a way that the staff can make seating for larger groups.  But there are several places to sit along the wall that I'd consider semi-private booths.  They're nice for a more intimate setting, but remember, you're in Pizza Rock (not Pizza Light Jazz).  (They can also set you up for private dining if you prefer.  Check the website or call them for details.)  There's a bar and happy hour.  If you're in the mood for a beer or cocktail, you can satisfy your craving.    The waitstaff is always hopping, but they're always awesome, keeping drinks full and checking in regularly to see if there's anything you might need even after you're enjoying your pizza.  So now you've decided to give Pizza Rock a try.  There's metered parking on the streets all over downtown, and you'll want to look on Ogden first as you approach the restaurant.  Interestingly, spots seem to opening up as quickly as they get taken there, so try your luck or even make a couple laps around the block.  Beware of the small, off-street lot marked Public Parking at the corner of North Casino Center Blvd and Ogden.  It's also metered but the cost is $15 for the first hour.   (Yes, you read that right!)  I recommend you stick to the more affordable meters on the street or find another lot associated with the downtown area.  Save your cash for the delicious food!",

Both drinks were really great and a generous portion for a good price. We also split their award-winning, Cal Italia pizza which was delightfully delicious.

I like Neopolitana style pizza a lot.  After that, NY and Detroit style.  So since PR was known for their Neopolitana, I initially ordered that.  However, the waiter said that it was not really big enough for two ppl.  So we opted for the Cal Italia.  Great choice!  It had just the right amount of salty and sweet.  And the crust was incredible.  I think they use some sort of special flour.  Whatever it was, the chew was perfect.    All of the pizzas look good, but things here are a bit pricey.  Though I think what we had today was worth it, I might  be hard pressed to pay almost $40 for a pie (the cost of a sicilian).  They do sell pizza by the slice though.  The basic slices were $4 each, which is on par with NYC.  But they also offered specialty slices like purple potato with rosemary and pesto.  I don't know if that flavor combination works, but I'm tempted enough to fork over the $6 next time.  And there's def going to be a next time!",

We originally lined up outside by the walk up window, but were later directed inside by one of the pizza guys since there were a bunch of seats open at the counter. The voucher allowed us to get any slice from the menu above the oven-Cheese, Pepperoni, Picante, Slice of the Day, Vegetarian, or Purple Potato were the choices at the time.  Never had Peruvian Purple Potato on a pizza before, but I'm glad I went with a slice. It also came with Pancetta, Feta Cheese, Rosemary, and Pesto. Each flavorful bite was delicious, and the crust was crisp with a nice chewiness to it, just the way I like it, and I'd definitely come back for this! Yes, I'm still a fan, and thank goodness we don't have to deal with massive wait times for a table like the Chef Tony's Napoletana in SF.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

    "text": "The wait wasn't too bad. Although the waitress said 25-35 minutes we probably only waited for about 15. What I like about the place is it's got good music playing, and the service is really nice and attentive even during dinner rush.   Now to the food: we ordered the famous award-winning Margherita and the Cal Italia. The Margherita has a nice nutty aftertaste to it, however, I don't see what makes it so special compared to any other Margherita pizza I've had. I think the Cal Italia was much better and is the superior pizza. The inclusion of balsamic and parmigianno makes the pizza very creamy and not too sweet.   The only complaints I have are that the food is overpriced and the sangria was weak. They charge $25 for a New York style pizza - insane. If you've been to New York, you know that a slice of pizza is $1. And the pizzas are pretty small too, one person can definitely finish a whole pizza.",

Our waiter was amazing .. he kept filling up our drinks n checking up on us even tho he had a party of 12 ppl on one table .. I had meatball sub. I think it cldve had more seasoning to the meatballs or just maybe a extra side of marinara sauce but over all it was very fulfilling .. it's bigger than what the pic looks like and the price was great .. my bf has the sausage calzone was a great size as well he said it tastes great as well.  The fries had garlic.  Wasn't too much garlic just right .. it was a great place to try out  will come again",

The atmosphere was amazing, service excellent, happy hour menu and pricing beyond awesome, and the food....the food was out of this world!  Honey ordered the deep fried Manhattan calzone, and I tried the famous Cal Italia personal pizza; all this after sampling the Italian gorgonzola fries (my mouth is still watering)!!!!!  Menu is delivered to your table as an old vinyl record album,  the happy hour food menu is printed on the vinyl record itself, neatly tucked inside the record album- genius and fun for the customer!!!  Honey loved the Peter built semi truck (DJ sound booth) in the dining room.    I'm glad we sat down to eat just after three p.m., I could see a wait for seating during dinner rush.  All the way around, an awesome experience, and sure palate pleasers!  We'll definately be back, during happy hour, of course, on our next trip to Las Vegas!!!",

Our drinks were always full, they offered suggestions on pizzas, helped a vegan co worker get exactly what she wanted and our food came out in a timely manner.  I am super picky about my pizza because I make it from scratch at home, but I have to tell you that the pizza was delicious!  I took a peek at the bill and it was very reasonable for the size of the party we had and the amount of pizzas we ordered.  Thank you Pizza Rock for helping to make our mid-year event a night to remember!  I will definitely be back next time I am downtown!",

Then, I get my pizza and there is this BLACK GREASE (see photo attached) on the bottom of my pizza; I took one bite and spit it out! Tasted like burnt-rancid oil. On top of that, the pizza guy was LAUGHING and grinning with a big smile!! Like what the heck is so funny dude?? I'm think he was high! Totally inappropriate and unexceptable!!!! Parm and garlic shakers were BONE DRY empty! He kept guests waiting long, and BURNT A WHOLE PIZZA, which was the icing on the cake! I had COMPLETELY lost my appetite now, as the smell of burnt pizza and smoke filled the restaurant. I loved this place! Now I'm hesitant to go back, PLEASE FIRE the young guy!!!!",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday night with a group of 6 friends after very briefly doing the Fremont-Tourist-Thing. I had been dying to give this place a try since, after living in Chicago for 5 years, Vegas pizza had sucked balls, on the whole.   We ordered the Cal Italia, and the Old Chicago, because fuck yes Chicago Cracker Crust. We also ordered a third pizza that never showed, but was only briefly missed. The other two were so wonderful...I almost don't have anything to say because, yeah, perfect pizza. Perfect. Crust, perfect. Sauces, perfect. Balance, ridiculously perfect. Ugh, I want some right now.  Waitress was awesome; attentive, informative, helpful, and not hovering, and the place was packed, so I do not hold the missing pie (which we were never charged for, either) against anyone. Super kind to one of my tourist friends, whose accent makes her pronunciation of things like \"prosciutto\" a source of embarrassment quite often. We felt utterly welcome and had a truly happiness-enducing meal.   My only gripe was the noise level, which was pitched just above \"easy conversation\" range. That's to be expected at Fremont on a Friday, but not my bag. Will try it on a different night to see if the levels change.  It's a little on the pricey side for pizza, but I find I really don't care. It's so good I am happy to pay a little bit extra for pizza I truly enjoy. I will just go all Rhett Butler on my budget and remind it I don't give a damn. It's cheap for actually sating the Great Pizza itch.   My favorite pizza in Vegas, so far by miles. That cracker crust. Yessss. Will be back as soon and as often as I can manage.",

Well-seasoned pizzas of all different variations in Italian and American. Plus they even, cook the pizza in different ovens based on the type and adjust the temperature accordingly.

Food: was amazing, the pizza we got was a thick crust full of awesomeness. Meatballs were delicious and fries were crispy.  The name: it's a little misleading there's no Rock going on. My boys were stoked because they are metal fans and every song they had on the TVs were Pop songs.  If you want to get a parking validation be weary trying to get it from the girls at the hostesses station they act like it's such a chore and they'll tell you they can only do it if you park across the street, they eventually gave us a sticker, and had no problem getting it validated at the Binions Hotel. We will go back when in Vegas..",

    "text": "We came here on a Thursday evening and ordered  1. Calamari Fritti, 13 - Traditional or Calabrese style with calabrese aioli and marinara dipping sauces  2. American  Original - Downtown, 20  - Mozzarella, pepperoni, molinari salami, bacon, sahhlots, mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, black olives, Italian sausage, cherry tomatoes 3. Soda, Unlimited refills, 3 for 7 (Used the Living Social Deal - $29 for $8 beer, Antipasti, and pizza (excludes NY22\")  - Parking is pretty lame. We tried Binions because they have Free Parking with validation, but they took out the validation next the cashiers! Fail. So there practically isn't anymore free parking on the strip. You gotta eat at their restaurant or actively gamble. $8 for 1.5hrs. Shiet... - Got in around 9pm, seated in a few minutes. Sat in the back, next to the bar, right next to a speaker, great place to have a screaming conversation. - Ran out of Sicilian Style dough. Just our luck. \"Just served the last one 15 min ago.\" I guess if we came earlier, we wouldn't have had to deal with that problem. We actually wanted to order The Boss pizza instead because the crust is thicker with Sicilian Style. I'm not much of a fan of \"the potato chip like pizza\" or should I say thin crust. haha  -Because we sat next to a speaker, our server, Chelsei, couldn't really hear us over the music. After several AHEM, excuse meess....one of them got through, and she handed us utensils and napkins after we got our antipasti. Who eats calamari with a fork and towel anyway? haha. come on now...Anyway, she was very good at drink refills and attentive thereafter.  - The calamari was great. We got it half and half. I recommend it bc after I ate a few spicy, i needed to balance it out with one regular. Spicy one or Calabrese style tasted better. Chelsei hooked it up with dat extra dip doe. haha. Needed that for the extra dunkers na mmm saying. LOL.  - The downtown was fresh. Loved the cherry tomatoes, so red. 6 slices. didn't like the uncooked onions. peeled off. Wood fire pizza nom!   Break down of the Living Social deal... - So if you choose the most expensive Antipasti, which is  the Calamari at $13 and the most expensive pizza, Romana, at $35, get the beer $8, then technically, you can get the saving at 48%.  - I probably should have just saved the deal for another day and just used the Yelp Check-in Promo of 15% off.",

We parked in a public lot on Stewart ($1 per hour although the meters were covered so it was free!) and walked up 3rd. It was Thursday night around 8pm. We sat within 5 minutes and had drinks in less than 10. Extensive craft beer menu including Joseph James (local to NV). Pizza comes in various styles - we ordered a New York Style and a Napoletana. Being both from New York and Neopolitan, I can tell you with confidence these were the real deal (it got my 76 year old dads seal of approval too).  Waiter was super Friday and attentive, and appreciative of our compliments. He even gave us recommendations for other good eats in the area.  When you're done, walk across the street to Fremont if that's your thing. Highly, highly recommend!",

Pizza Rock has them all, and does them all well--as well as their own creative twists.

The crust was also deliciously chewy and lightly charred.  Really did not expect such a good pizza. AND most importantly for us they had gluten free crust which my husband  very much enjoyed.

The staff was super nice and showed great knowledge of the menu.  We were seated in a cute little hideaway table that was too precious for words....  Meant to take pictures of the pizza, but was so excited when it arrived we started eating and realized it was too late. hahaha....  The ginger beer is the REAL stuff, like with ginger floating in it. Really good if you like ginger beer...  The foccacia bread is worth the extra couple of dollars, especially when you're hungry but don't want to overdue it before the REAL pizza gets there...  All in all, a positive experience. Good food, decent price with nice staff. Would definitely tell others to give it a try and I DEFINITELY will go back...maybe this weekend :)",

You can order a slice of everything instead of just getting one big pizza when you sit inside the restaurant.   But seriously.  The pizza is amazing.",

You got it. Seriously, they can supply you with whatever your little pizza loving heart desires.  I've ordered the slice of the day (it changes), and I've had their cheese and pepperoni by-the-slice offerings. All are solid. In terms of seating internally, there's a giant wrap-around bar to enjoy with good beer on tap and TVs all around for sports.  I've never had bad service here, from either the pizza pie guys or the servers. Win!",

The pies are most definitely made to share and they even have honey (be sure to ask for it). My only disappointment was the uneven distribution of sauce. I had one slice that was very sauce heavy with little cheese. Also, there was a sort of mascarpone dolloped all over the pizza and it was a little too sweet for my taste.

What I really like about Pizza Rock is that they have a variety of different ovens, so they make various styles of pizza. The ambiance is pretty lively, expected of a Down Town joint. If you are not in the mood for a sit-down meal, you can order to go at the counter with an option of single slices.  Whether you're looking for a sit worn experience, having some drinks at the bar, or grabbing a slice to go, this place can work!",

The staff were very friendly but lacked in attentiveness which mostly just had to do with our waiter. We chose a few different pizzas and some appetizers. The truffle fries were a bit underwhelming and the amount of fries you get for $8 ish dollars was not worth it. The pizzas themselves were nothing more than average at best. My boyfriend actually compared the Detroit to little caesars deep dish in which he said little Caesar's was actually better. Bummer. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and was not impressed by the flavor of the sauce or the meatballs. The bread that it came with was tasty but I'm a carb lover so I could be biased. I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the ambiance and promptness of our party being sat. Lots of really good places to eat in Vegas but this was just not one of them for me.",

Tony Gemignani's downtown Las Vegas place lived up to my expectations, I had been wanting to go here for a long time and this was one of the rare instances when the food was even better than I imagined.  My wife and I ordered the New Yorker pizza which was a True New York style thin crust with house made fennel sausage, pepperoni, garlic, light tomato sauce, olive oil and three cheeses. The best part was probably the small dabs of Ricotta, but the pizza with all the ingredients as a whole worked together beautifully.  Great location right downtown across from the Downtown Grand and a block from the Fremont street experience.  Can't wait to go back and try a few other pies.",

Very good, big, floppy, foldable, NY style slices that are hard to beat outside of Brooklyn. You can't go wrong with any choice really. The Purple Potato and veggie are very good, but you can't miss with the classic cheese or pep. This place is a must have anytime I'm here.",

They have so many options!  I ended up getting the stout pizza and stout combo. SO GOOD. It's the perfect size for 2 people. If you like stouts like I do, it pairs well with the sausage and pepperoni pizza. The thin crust was delicious and their stout reduction glaze on top was a great finisher. I recommend.   Parking is horrible, since Fremont is so crowded. Just pay the parking and walk.",

Had the Caesars salad and the Brooklyn calzone.  The food was on par, the service was not.  In the latter half of the meal, server disappeared.    They came up for air once, to deliver the check, then nowhere to be seen for 15-20 minutes.   Eventually, way later, another server who had walked by my table over-and-over grabbed the credit card leather in frustration and closed the ticket out.  Extremely frustrating and disappointing service after a meal with food worth coming back for.    Service matters, Pizza Rock.  It would be beneficial to not leave your customers hanging for 15-20 minutes when they're ready to end the meal and pay for your enjoyable food.",

Behind the counter there are two young adults who are running around with there heads cut off.

    "text": "One of my favorite stops on my last trip to Sin City was lunch at Pizza Rock.  They have a nice, large corner location in Downtown Las Vegas and what caught my eye was the flaming red \"Pizza Rock\" sign on their building.  Second thing that caught my eye was the awesome chalkboard sign in front of their doors that said \"Today's soup is beer.\"  Sold.    AMBIANCE  |  We walked in to a huge, high-ceiling, well-decorated and edgy pizza joint.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was a black semi-truck cabin sticking out of one of the walls.  The semi had a nice paint job with orange flames and added a nice touch to their edgy ambiance.  Their restaurant is large enough for parties and big groups and have multiple TV's on their walls and a couple above their bar.       CUSTOMER SERVICE  |  We didn't receive the best service from the hostesses, they weren't the friendliest and most approachable.  However, our server was excellent.  She was really friendly and knew it was our first time there so she made suggestions on what to get.  She also checked on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always filled.    FOOD & DRINKS  |  Because we had a late brunch, we only had room for fries and one pizza.  We chose the \"Downtown\" which was tasty and topped with mozzarella, pepperoni, bacon, some veggies and some really awesome linguica which could be mistaken for mini slices of pepperoni that curled up to look like little pepperoni cups.  The linguica was my favorite part of the pizza.  We enjoyed the truffle fries; truffle oil makes fries even better.  They had a nice selection of drinks at the bar and at least 10 types of beer on tap.    I will definitely head back to Pizza Rock on my next trip to Las Vegas.  There are a ton of other things they offer besides pizza like Calzone, salad, Stromboli, pasta, burgers and desert.  They also have great operating hours (open till' midnight Sunday-Thursday and till' 2am Friday-Sunday)  Tips:  Check in on the Yelp app and get 15% off the bill and there's a local discount available.",

    "text": "Ok, I will admit they are probably losing a star because I had high expectations and in the end they just did not meet them, they deserved to lose at least one though. We went yesterday with a party of 12 or so. They had plenty of seating and we made reservations an hour and 1/2 in advance. The prices were fine, about $9-11 for a cocktail. I have been to Tony's restaurant in San Francisco and my friend absolutely loves his food and does her best to recreate it and recommended going to pizza rock. I ordered the honey pie and while I was expecting a crisp crust with some char, I got a very soft one (my fault for not realizing thats what California style meant I guess) and the spice was distributed very unevenly with 2 slices having almost all of it and some having basically none. Looking at other peoples pics of honey pies I think mine had about 1/4th the onions as well. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their food though so that was good. Service however was slow, and not because we were a big party. Food didn't take too long but then it's as if both of the servers either forgot about us or each thought the other was attending us. We were there for an hour and 45 min. In that time you would expect a few water fills and someone to ask about drinks or checks and boxes but instead people just sat there with 1/2 the party completely out of water and I heard one of my party say \"man I need more water\" and another say \"psh good luck with that\" I waited hopefully for maybe 10 min after hearing this and then had to go out of the room and find a server and ask for water which was surprisingly hard to do. People again finished water but no more refills came, oh well not too bad I guess. But then checks never came either and I had to repeat the finding a server routine, I felt really bad for the member of the party who needed to go to catch a plane. I do not blame the server I flagged down, i'm not sure she was even our server (we had 2 and I had a guy on my side who left after drink orders never to be seen again). But the lack of coordination coupled with mild disappointment in my food when the restaurant did not seem busy seems too much. Maybe they didn't like having a big party of late 20 early 30 year olds but there was auto gratuity so it's not like they had to worry about tipping and my party was really well behaved with many of them being worried whenever we got slightly loud.",

But that has absolutely nothing to do with quality and taste of the pies they serve up here, which are on point.

    "text": "Pizza Rock has the absolute best cheese pizza by the slice. Located right across from the Downtown Grand, Pizza Rock occupies a prime location. Whenever I'm downtown, I always end up at the to-go window for a late night buzzed-driven snack fest (it doesn't help that Pizza Rock stays open till 2AM on Fridays and Saturdays).   From the window, the slices at face value don't seem like much. I've witnessed many passerby ogle at the pizzas offered and then keep walking on by. They don't know what they're missing, I tell you! When you order, the window employees pop your pizza slice back in the oven. Your pizza slice is now pipping hot and newly fresh. :) The cheese slices are dripping with cheese. I don't know how that thin crust can hold the weight of all the cheese. I don't even like thin crust, but I like Pizza Rock's thin crust! Don't even get me started on the size of the slices. You'd need ogre hands to be able to handle one of those slices.   Slices of pizza are $4-6. A fountain drink is $3.25. You can either sit at the stools inside (elbow room is limited) or try your luck with seating outside. Be warned! The pizza is definitely greasy. Don't be a pansy about it. Eat it! Don't dab at it with your napkin. It adds to the flavor.   I prefer getting my pizza at the window versus eating inside at the restaurant. It's pretty pricey for a pizza place and my dining experience was lackluster. The garlic fries ($6) were cold and disappointing, and the garlic bread ($7) was as hard as a brick. And the hostess girls were snooty. Worthy mention: The Picante ($19) pizza was inventive and loaded with flavor.      I forgive all, because I can't get enough of my cheese pizza slices. Until next time, Pizza Rock.  *Too bad you can't use that 15% of Yelp check-in offer at the window.   YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #10",

Joel the manager was a rock star when service started a little slow but took over and gave us a first class experience. We will be back for brunch, lunch, dinner, happy hour!!

The pizza is simple vegetarian but the aroma and flavors just entrap your taste buds. The chef only makes 73 each day so better get early to try. Garlic bread is a good way to get immersed into the taste wonderland.Must visit.  Waiters can be slow at some times.",

After we had eaten 5 of the 8 pieces of the pizza (I grabbed my 2nd of the St. Anthony) I found a short  black hair about an inch long that was baked into the cheese on it the pizza. When I brought it to the waiters attention he promptly swiped the plate from me & took it back to the kitchen only to come out to tell me that he showed it to the chef & the chef said that it was char that was on the cheese. I am sorry but that was not char & I know what the difference is between char from the bottom of the pizza & an inch long black hair is. It completely grossed me out. No offer to rectify the situation. Waiter moved on away from the table as fast as he could.",

We tried three different pies ranging from the New Yorker, to a Sicilian, and a classic cheese. The New Yorker was classic thin with ricotta cheese and house made sausage and pepperoni! The cheese was thin crust and maybe the winner of the night for just a solid, good, perfectly cooked pie! The Sicilian was very good as well, with a good deep dish dough and miniature pepperonis! You can get a large variety of pizza styles here ranging from Chicago deep dish, to New York thin crust, and more creative gourmet styles! My one knock on this place is that it is way over priced! In Vegas where there are a few great pizza joints, with Vegas style prices, this place definitely hits the high mark with our three pies and sodas topping the $100 plateau! This southern gentleman enjoyed his meal, loved the decor of the restaurant, loved the proximity to Fremont, but probably wouldn't come back due to the extreme prices! At the same time I certainly would encourage you to try it out as it is a tasty pie!",

It is so fresh made with delicious ingredients! I travel from Orange County, California for this place! Every time I go back it never disappoints! The wait could be over an hour but so worth it! Parking is a hassle but that's ok, what do you expect in Vegas. The best part of the pizza is the dough! I love the Picante and the Pepperoni Pizza. Customer service is good- very friendly, kind staff. Price is ok, not too bad. I came here just last Sunday and they had a really nice Acoustic Brunch, didn't get the brunch but the music went pleasantly well with my meal. Will definitely keep recommending this pizza joint to friends and family on their next vacation to Vegas.",

We also got the fried artichokes, which were delicious. You get two deep fried artichoke quarters - they looked like chicken drumsticks - and a tasty dipping sauce. The arugula salad with pancetta, mozzarella and tomatoes was good, but definitely large and a bit much. Because the pizza came out before our salad, they comped it (salad) off our bill.   They had great beer selections on tap (I had a 20 oz. Dogfish Head 90 minute and hubby had the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA)  and a great happy hour (we weren't there for that though). Overall the service was excellent, but the ambiance is a little... Different. It's like a \"dive bar\" but it's intentional to align with the \"rock music\" theme.  I would love to come back here.",

Sauce is fantastic, crust is always consistent- not too soft or crispy. Classic pepperoni has a rich tomato sauce with a little spice. The actual pepperoni is even fantastic. The New Yorker has a more olive based sauce with garlic, still yummy. One of the few places that makes a Sicilian pie and doesn't require 3 hours pre-order. We love this place! Carry out is convenient and downtown location is a fun atmosphere for a date or family outing. Highly recommended!!",

Restaurant - loud, spacious, plenty of seating for large and/or small parties.  Service - A-ok.  No complaints about our server.   Food- tried meatballs and calamari (half spicy / half regular) for appetizers. And Picante pizza for main meal. Overall not bad but nothing memorable. I didn't like the spicy calamari though. I thought they would toss in cherry peppers or something like that for the spiciness. Except it was more like chili powder. Way too overpowering in a bad way.  I'd give it one more shot and order something different to truly judge whether it's worth repeat visits or not.",

    "text": "The pizza in Naples is so good because of the flavor imparted to the dough by the oven. On a molecular level this is the formation of carbon due to high temperature pyrolisis of the pizza dough surface. Some of this carbon remains in the oven and some of it adheres to the pizza dough. The carbon that remains in the oven over time is transformed into exotic and possibly undiscovered allotropes due to daily thermal cycles. These exotic carbons adhere to the pizza, providing its flavor. The pizza in Naples is so good because the carbon has had centuries to form unique and flavorful allotropes in the old ovens.  That said, one day the oven here will also be capable of producing the Naples carbon, and this pizza will then be truly amazing. However, at present the new oven, like new wine, is producing young and bitter carbon structures that have not yet reached full maturity. Until then, stick with the slices in the window which are on par with the best NYC pizzas.",

To sum it up, a large plate of greasy under seasoned arugula with cherry tomato and mozz .... With bacon bits ... Seriously ? 18$? Our pizza was greasy and didn't taste of any fig as stated on the menu. Extremely disappointed, again. Our service started out nicely at the bar, but we were with a large party and moved to a table. That's where service went downhill. Our food was not even delivered properly, they auctioned  our food off. We never got share plates or even water; basics to any dining experience ...

I'm actually starting to like the thinner crust more and more each time I visit.  No need for me to divulge in thick crust.   The second day, he got the same pizza, and I had the chicken parmesan. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the crust around it was crispy and perfect, sauce and cheese all delish. The only thing I didn't like was the bucatini pasta under it. It's quite thick and either wasn't cooked long enough, or that's just how it is...either way, I wasn't a fan so if I do order that again, I'll go for a different type of pasta.",

Park at the Downtown Grand like the website says - just a short walk.  Got a few bottled beers from the bar for the wait - decent beer selections & appreciated the $4 prices for some of the bottles.  Lots of TVs - this was a March Madness weekend - yet the four TVs in our line of site all had the same game on where there were at least 3 other games going.  Even when the sole game on went to halftime the screens weren't changed.  When that game ended, the screens were finally changed so two different games were on.  Pizza Rock has Coke products - yea! Ordered meatballs for appetizer and \"The Boss\" Sicilian for our party of 3 to share. FYI - they will take items off their pizza but won't substitute other items.    Meatballs were excellent.  Tried to order a second appetizer after the meatballs came to the table; took forever for server to come back to table and our garlic bread order came to table after the pizza.    Menu was huge and complex and could have had more detail.  Some pizzas are 12\" and some are 16\"; some are thin crust and some are 1.5\" thick crust and some are served square.  Why not put all of this on the menu?  The server explained each pizza type but it was confusing trying to remember which pizza was what size.  Our Sicilian pizza was quite good.  After the first bite, we realized something was off - some of the toppings were cold, while the crust was hot.  When our server came back to the table, I asked if there were topping added to the pizza after it was cooked and she said yes.  From what I could determine, all of the vegetable toppings were cold - added to the pizza after it came out of the oven.  We had asked for no green peppers and no olives, would have been even more cold toppings without leaving these off.  Didn't affect the flavor of the pizza too much.  Never had pizza like this before.  The garlic bread was excellent.  It was served with huge side of marinara.  We took home more than half of the pizza.  Can't wait for leftovers - I can heat all of the toppings.  HUGE wait for tables when we left. Make a reservation, if you have the opportunity.  We'll be back.",

The flatbread was phenomenal as was the white pizza and their award-winning Margarita pizza. While the food was incredible, along with the service, the biggest drawback was the loud music.  It literally overpowered our group's conversation where we had to yell at one another to actually hear anything.  I understand the name \"Pizza Rocks\" however I didn't realize I would be dining in a concert environment.  Perhaps I should have ordered \"to go\" like many others that were in the main lobby.",

When I explained to him those were side dishes and I wanted deserts... He told me I was wrong.   I literally hung up in frustration after arguing with this guy for 5 minutes.  Nothing at all against Hispanics, my husband is Hispanic... But why the fuck did the English speaking hostess transfer me to someone uncapable of holding a conversation in English?! FAIL PIZZA ROCK.

(Despite some ignorant patrons who I heard mumble as I walked by, \"OHH F*ck they sit kids near us.\" and think all kids in restaurants cry mine does not) The staff is really friendly and helpful in choosing a pizza to your tastes.

It's quite loud, which I liked, and they played music videos for the diners to enjoy. If you want to enjoy a quiet dinner, this is NOT the spot for you! Very fun for 20-30 somethings and I assume that is their target audience as most of the music videos were from the 90's. As for the food, the pizza is amazing. We ordered the Downtown pizza (good for 2-3 people) and it's the perfect style for people who liked everything on their pizza. Love the premium toppings! Yummy and great prices!",

    "text": "I read really good reviews about this place so I was very excited to try for first time. We were hungry, so we ordered the Gorgonzola fries and the two different calamari's for appetizers, The original and calabrese style. The Gorgonzola fries were to die for, they were crispy but had such a strong taste of the cheese sauce on it, very flavorful and delicious! The original calamari was good, they only gave one small little lemon wedge for all that calamari, so that bugged me. The calabrese calamari was super spicy, so don't Oder this unless you like heat. The aioli sauce and marinara that it came with were also really good. For the pizza, I had to try the award winning Margherita pizza and we ordered the QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE. The Margherita pizza came out first and Looked really good. I tried the crust first, very good crust on outer edges. So I picked up the slice to eat and it was so limp and soggy it just falls. You have to eat it folded or you can't bite into it. So one complaint is that the crust toward the middle of pizza is soggy and wet. The sauce was a bit tart for my taste. All in all it was okay, but I wouldn't order again. Then the quail egg white rose potato guanciale came and it looked good once again. But, WOW, TOO SPICY! I didn't see any potato on it and the server said they grate it because they use the 900 degree oven and it cooks in 3 minutes and unless you grate the potato very fine it would remain raw. So basically you can't even taste potato on it, I didn't know or see if it had pork cheek on it. The chorizo is what you see and taste and it is too overpowering. That's all I tasted. Lastly we ordered the tiramisu, that was one of the best tiramisu's i've ever had! I wanna go back and try different pizza's next time. I can tell they do good food here, I think that I just ordered the wrong pizza's for me. Also for two appetizers , two 12 -inch pizza's , two soft drinks and one tiramisu, our check came to over $70! I gasped, lol.",

Recommendation is happy hour throughout the week for lower prices and who knows, maybe a lower volume on the obnoxiously loud sound system.  So, food good, service very good, music volume ridiculous.  Fix the volume first and maybe that will make the price of the food not seem like its overpriced due to an overall better dining experience.  Oh, kids menu is good but don't expect to hear your minion over the music that's blasting.  Did I mention it's loud?!?",

We were WOW'ed by this amazing restaurant. They offer any kind of pizza you want. The arrugala,pancetta(crispy!) and fresh mozzarella salad was delicious and enough for three people. I cannot give them enough stars! Come hungry and with friends - pizzas  are huge! They are even enthusiastic about their gf crust. This will be on my whenever I come back to Vegas list!",

    "text": "A couple years ago, I thought it would be a good idea to have a restaurant that specializes in serving several distinctly different types of pizza as a sort of homage to the great pizzas from around the world. Well this place beat me to it and did it better than I ever could.  The concept is solid. The execution is, well impressive. Only drawback is that the sheer variety of doughs they have to make forces them to limit several of the pies to a daily maximum. On one occasion they were already out of the pizza we wanted. Still, our second choice was quite good so no harm, no foul.  Happy hour food specials are very reasonable and quite good. The meatballs, although simple, are excellent.  Slice bar up front serves only the new york-style slice, which is definitely not the strength of this place, but if you are in a rush I think the Picante slice is a creative change of pace from traditional flavors and is definitely worth a try.  A german hefeweizen would go great with the spicy notes found throughout the menu, unfortunately there is none to be found here.",

    "text": "Just haaad to try the legend that has become Pizza Rock, this wonderful italian themed menu has mountains to offer its customers and a warm, friendly front of house hostess'.  But the star of the visit for me was the pizza oven and cook on display and dealing slices out the window, really, really made my heart feel like I was in Harlem or somewhere in New York   As for the pizza itself I ordered two pizzas and one burger, a bit of a challenge to get the kitchen to perfectly have the order ready in a professional time, but they were on it four stars alll the way with this restaurant.  Downsides were they had no Sicilian crust or dough so I could only order their La Regina on Chicago style an amazing homage to the freshness and taste of Chicago.  Their American Pizza is worth its weight on the menu and could have the stomach to go against the most difficult palate.  Don't forget Pizza Rock on your next trip into Downtown Las Vegas area, grab a slice out the door, or call in an order they are very easy, professional crew.  BTW the Burrata Burger was the most awesome bacon burger experience of the week.",

If you have a small group or a big group consider Pizza Rock for your dining when in and around downtown Las Vegas. They also had fun Trivia night and it was a nice diversion! Reasonably priced and so much quantity this restaurant is not \"just\" a Pizza place. It is a great place to meet and mingle!",

The hostesses were very sweet and took us right to our table. They even offered to put the cake we brought in their walk-in to keep chilled (it was chocolate with Bavarian cream)  Our server was Summer... She was so nice & welcoming even letting us know about Happy Hour specials that we had a few minutes to take advantage of. Who doesn't love a few bucks off their favorite glass of vino?   Summer was very informative & made GREAT recommendations for our party of 12.   We started with cocktails and appetizers... Meatballs, 3 kinds of Italian fries (Gorgonzola are super yummy!) & grilled prosciutto wrapped asparagus.  For our main dish we ordered Romana I & II, NY 22\" Pepperoni & Sicilian style La Regina. My favorite was the Romana I, but everything was delicious!  There was so much we were on sensory overload.   We will be back... So many more pies to try!",

    "text": "I won't lie - I was skeptical.  How can one place make so many different styles of pizza and make them all well?    Well, this place has come pretty darn close to achieving that goal.  We had the margherita, cal italia (proscuitto, fig, balsamic), and la regina (sicilian with picante, mozz, arugula).  Notice all the ones we ordered had won some kind of award.  I'm used to margherita not having sauce, this one had sauce on it - but it was delish!  The sauce was slightly acidic and not sweet, which I really enjoyed.  The crust was perfect, just wish the mozz was more spectacular.  The cal italia had a nice blend of savory and sweet flavors as well as amazing crust.  The la regina was my least favorite, the toppings were a little sparse and I've had better crust.   Cool interior, awesome service.  I must be getting elderly as I was complaining to my tablemates about how loud the music was....  but even though I was screaming they couldn't hear me.  Not the place for a first date.  Get ready to use sign language and stare at the person across/next to you eat while you listen to 80s British and American rock.  Music videos included.    Tip: Parking is a pain.  Just valet it right outside the restaurant at the hotel across the way.  You will probably end up paying the same amount anyway but won't have to walk a block.",

Service was faster here which i think it may have to do with the location and my sister thinks because they have been open much longer. They have a to go area where they serve up pizza by the slice and of course the dine in area. The setup along with the music does not get any better than this in my opinion. They show the video that goes along with the music. Ordered a plain pepperoni pizza that says it feeds six but its more like 6 grown men!!! It was only a pepperoni but it was the perfect amount of grease to cheese to sauce ration. It melted in my mouth. Also had the spicy fries calamari which I absolutley loved!  JJ was our server and he was ahmazing!!!!! You want some good pizza try it out, they have an amazing selection of alcohol,  and food!",

The pizza was better than average, but not great - although the pepperoni was really, really good (thinly sliced & the right amount of spicy kick).   Try going during happy hour, before you go out for the night. They have cheap, ice cold draught beers and $5 personal pizzas that are plenty big enough for a quick dinner. If you're like me, you can lose the money you saved on dinner at Caesar's Palace blackjack tables. Damn it.",

The pizza and menu were just between a 3-4 as I think the many choices of pizza is just too overwhelming.  I like to be able to order the best thing for me every time we go out (don't we all) and if I would have asked all the questions I needed to in order to understand which pizza would have been the best for me, I would have driven Ryan mad!  We tried two types which as I said were just a 3-4 and sorry I can't remember which ones they were unless I look at the menu, but we will be back and hopefully I will choose better for my liking next time.",

He had been raving about Pizza Rock for almost a year, and on our last trip to Vegas, was disappointed when it wasn't high on my list to go to.  So...needing some lunch and wanting to go downtown for the day, I suggested Pizza Rock - needless to say I was met with absolutely no resistance.    Pizza Rock could get me closer to the LOVE side of the house.  We went with the Cal-Italia.  A little sweet, a little funky and absolutely all delicious and full of happy tummy goodness.  I could definitely be persuaded to go again.  So many pizzas, so little time.",

    "text": "How have I never reviewed this place before??? Favorite pizza place in Vegas, hands down.  They do different styles of pizza (new york, chicago, sicilian) and they do them all pretty well, imo. It's a pretty cool concept, actually, because most places will specialize in one style but Pizza Rock is equipped to handle them all. The menu is also really informative in terms of what type of oven they use, what temperatures, and all those things that you gastronomy buffs will find cool.  My favorite  (well, there are two actually) are the Cal Italia, from the \"Classic Italian\" section, which is Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Balsamic Reduction (No Sauce) and the Sausage and Stout Pizza which is Honey Malted Dough Made with Stout Beer, Fresh Mozzarella, House Made Beer Sausage, Caramelized Onions, Fontina, Green Onions, Crushed Red Peppers, Beer Salt & a Sweet Stout Beer Reduction. The Stout and Sausage Pizza is only made in limited quantity and served with Guinness. Both very different pizzas but both so so soooo yummy.  There is a take out area that does pizza by the slice. Classic options. I like the purple potato (or something to that effect). Pretty quick turnover in the take out area. Also note: if you dine-in, it'll probably be a bit of a wait as nobody rushes you during your meal and the place isn't SUPER huge.  Overall, I'd say this place is worth a stop over while you're in Vegas. I always try to make a trip there when I'm in the area. So many options! So many things to try! Also full bar and solid beer selection, as added bonus.",

Anyways, Pizza Rock has an abundance of thin crusts, although they do have the Detroit pizza as well which is a thicker crust (and actually pretty tasty). The crust is light and fluffy and I love the charred taste that comes with it. As far as which pizza to choose, honestly you can't go wrong with any of them. I say try all of them! They also have happy hour (can get a personal pizza and discount off certain alcohols). Another plus is that they are open late which is great for this downtown location.",

The menu is sprawling, and it has many different varieties of pizzas, each with different crusts, cooked in different ovens, and at different temperatures. The pizzas are big, too. I got the Artichoke Joe and the New York.  They were both on a somewhat thin, but still soft crust. The Artichoke Joe had tons of cheese, artichoke, and spinach, while the New York had pepperoni and sausage, along with ricotta, which is arguably the world's best cheese. You'll want to try everything here. If you're in the downtown area, this is must.",

Gorgonzola fries - nice flavor but very soggy!    Cal Italia pizza - Their award-winning pie, was so-so.  Too much sweetness, between the balsamic vinegar and fig preserves, with not enough savoriness to balance it out.  The Gorgonzola cheese was an unexpected but welcome addition to the pizza as it provided some much needed depth of flavor.  However, there was not enough of it on there.  The prosciutto was too wet - drier would have been better in my opinion.  The asiago did not add any sharpness unfortunately.  Maybe put more on?  Another big pet peeve was the ratio of toppings/cheese to crust - way too much crust!  Also, the crust was incredibly bland, but maybe this was just my preference as a New Yorker.  Service - the waiter was not the most attentive.  I think it was because his shift was ending, but he completely forgot about my table and we went without water for most of the meal.",

    "text": "I was pretty shocked by our experience here this past weekend... I mean, this place is almost at 5 stars after 600 reviews! You would think even on an off night they're pretty amazing. But alas, it was very disappointing and if I go back, I would only do it on a relatively quiet weekday night.  We were there for a friends 30th birthday, and the group was about 15 people. There were a few other groups larger than us, and perhaps that was the reason that things were so chaotic. Our server was stressed and unfriendly, but hey...I've been there. I know it's terrible to be stretched so thin you can't even breathe, but at some point the disorganization got pretty comical.  Drinks and food were brought out randomly with people yelling out what it was and people having to raise their hand. This was funny because it was a long table, and it was LOUD in there, and I happen to be sitting on the end where the servers were coming from. Seemingly none of the servers knew where anything was going. All night, from drinks to extra silverware to pizza, people would just come out and yell something... and more than likely not get a quick response because nobody could hear them. A bunch of times it wasn't even supposed to be for our table. So service, not great.  But all bad service can be redeemed by good food. Like I said, I know what it's like to be swamped as a server, so unless you're a complete bitch, then whatever. We're here for the food. However, we got \"The Ogden\" pizza, and it was just plain bad. It seemed undercooked, and the flavors just didn't come together at all. Perhaps it was rushed, but it wasn't crispy at all and it was rather oily. Unfortunately, the birthday girl and many others felt the same about their pizzas...it was just alright.  The prices weren't the worst, but they weren't cheap either. Because of the reviews and the higher than normal prices, I guess I expected too much. Even so, restaurants with this high of a rating still manage to blow me away, so I don't know what happened last night. Go back on a weekend night? Never.   I may try it again for lunch or something, but I just didn't even get a glimpse of what the fuss was about.",

    "text": "I had been here once when this place first opened, tried a margarita pizza and a pesto pizza, both were soggy and not exciting.  We came at lunch so it was not really busy and the service was just okay. I wasn't thrilled when my boyfriend and dad wanted to go back when my dad was in town visiting. I hesitantly agreed, so we went in during dinner time but early like 5pm ish. There were some open tables so we were seated right away. Our server was nice, but seemed kind of aloof but still managed to get our order right. I do like this place for the beer selection. They have a lot of different beers on tap and in bottles so it was nice to be able to have my favorite imported beer with my pizza.  There are many pizza choices on the menu but we opted for a New Yorker pizza. It had fresh mozzarella balls on it, sausage and fennel. It was seriously one of the strangest looking but best pizzas I have ever had. The pizza was not greasy at all, super tender sausage and fresh creamy mozzarella. It was seriously so good even though it was different. It is also a good size so make sure you have people to share with. Also the price point of this place is a bit high, no surprise because you are in a tourist area and its newer, but keep in mind the prices before ordering tons of pizzas. Also most of their pizzas are a bigger size, so inquire before you actually order, larger parties of 5-7 tourists could probably be full of 2 pizza for example.  Overall my second time here was much better then the first, between the service, ambiance and quality of the pizza. I would consider coming back if I am downtown again.",

    "text": "Vegas folks are lucky that the Vegas equivalent of SF's Tony's Pizza Napoletana does not feature the 1 hour+ wait of the SF location. In True Vegas fashion, this place has a lively and fun atmosphere, ample seating and today's featured soup: beer. I've come here a few times and some of the pizza were hits and some were misses, I wish I had taken better note of which of the pizzas I had already tried. One time my husband had us order the \"QUAIL EGG WHITE ROSE POTATO GUANCIALE\" and the mix of toppings completely killed my taste buds, and the crust had a very burnt flavor (not the good kind I've had on their other pizzas). I personally wanted a Pepperoni calzone that day and was really disappointed by what we ordered. We left the restaurant, went to Commonwealth, and on our way back to our car, I stopped inside Pizza Rock and ordered a slice of pepperoni from the to-go area and it was heaven! Their MARGHERITA 17 is another reliable favorite that has a subtle flavor and they advertise that they only make 73 per day. The staff here is usually on top of their game, very well-trained. One thing I love about this place is the DJ mixing music videos - because who doesn't want to see Chumbawumba being mixed into other 90's hits while eating delicious food?   Parking: Park at the Grand and get your valet ticket validated at Pizza Rock, super simple.",

    "text": "So I read an article about Pizza Rock, in one of the magazines that is in the seat back pocket on the airplane. The article made it sound pretty good so we read some reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. This place, pardon the pun, ROCKS!  First off, the location is only one block off of Freemont Street, on Third Street, an easy walk from all of the Freemont Street action.  The place has a really cool grunge, rock bar feel, yet it is appropriate for all ages. Our 11 year old and 19 year old both really liked the place, especially the good music/video mix they have playing.  We visited Pizza Rock twice while we were in Vegas. Visit #1 was so good, we had to go back for more a few days later.  Visit #1 - I can't remember the server's name, but she was awesome. Her recommendations were spot on and our drinks were always full. We ordered the Cal Italia pizza which is a sauceless pizza with Asiago, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto, and Balsamic Reduction. It was amazing. One of the best pizzas we've ever had. My 11 year old had the Margherita and it was very similar to the Margherita pizzas you find in Rome. We finished lunch with a Tiramisu and it was extraordinary! The best I have ever had!  Visit #2 - The second time we came to the restaurant was a Saturday around 10 PM and it was significantly busier than our visit a few days earlier, at lunch. This time we had the New Yorker, which was good, but it did have too much Garlic and the Ricotta gave the pizza an odd taste. If you are a Garlic and Ricotta fan, you will like it, me not so much. We also ordered Frank's True Italian, which is a Pesto Pizza similar to the style you find at Grimaldi's, it was very good.  Long story short, this place is a top notch pizza joint and it deserves all of the awards it has won. My favorite pizza place in Nevada, bar none.",

One of our group was talking it up, so had to check it out.   First off, the pizza was amazing. I got the veggie. It wasn't overly greasy, overly cheesy, etc. They didn't overdo on the crust...the crust was relatively thin. Toppings were really fresh with huge baby tomatoes and spinach. Big slice as well!  Inside of the restaurant is pretty cool. It's classy, but rock n roll at the same time.   I love the 18-wheeler DJ booth. I have to say, the DJ kicked ass! He was playing a good mix of 90's hip hop, new wave, 90's grunge...it was perfect. However, it was a tad bit loud. I thought it was cool that instead of just music, they play music videos and throw in old SNL skits. We were highly entertained.   We ordered: * Classic meatballs * Woodfired asparagus * Fried green beans  Everything was super flavorful and cooked with fresh garlic. It was all quality...like some little Italian mom had just made it. Everything tasted so fresh!  Service was super fast and the waitress was no fuss no muss. She was busy, but made a point to get us everything really quickly.   This is really place to go after hours for a slice or a sit down!",

We saw Tony toss out something we would have eaten when we were at the chef's counter in SF.  I think Tony wouldn't have approved the pizza we got.  To end things on a positive note, the mobtown pizza was the saving grace and a friend of mine still talks about it and it was over a year ago since we were there (yes, my review is late as I became a yelper recently).

    "text": "Pizza Rock is one of my top recommendations when out-of-towners ask me where to grub near Fremont. They offer some great happy hour deals and the pizza is pretty freaking good. Pay the up-charge, assuming it's not already on the pie, and add the ricotta. It's a little cheese filled cloud of epic goodness.   Happy hour runs Monday-Friday from 3 to 6 and every night from 10 to close. They offer some pretty good food specials and there is a good selection of draft beer to choose from. Deschutes Fresh Squeezed is my go-to. It's usually on tap and $2 off during happy hour. Personal pizzas with one topping are 5 bucks and they're pretty big for a personal pizza.   I've had dinner in the dining room and drinks at the bar. Both are perfectly acceptable options. I tend to choose the bar unless I'm with a group. The bartenders are personable and I enjoy the energy in the bar. People always seem to be having a good time at Pizza Rock. I'm looking forward to checking out their other properties.",

    "text": "Hands down the best pizza in Vegas- and it's probably not close. It breaks the mold of gangster inspired stuffy pizza joints (prevalent in Vegas) where the Godfather soundtrack plays on repeat all day and every pizza comes with 35lbs of cheese on it.   I had not been to Pizza rock before last night. I had been to Tony's in SF (another location with the same owner) so I knew how good it was going to be but somehow just never got around to it- shameful I know. It is located downtown just outside of the ruckus. It is across the street from the Grand hotel and casino and you can valet park there to attend the restaurant.  We made a reservation but it didn't look like it was necessary for a Sunday night. As we were being lead to our table it took every bit of restraint I could muster to not snatch slices off the many delicious looking pizzas we walked by. The decor is very Orange County Chopper-esque and the music is a lot of rock from the 90's which is good for the newly over 30 and old crowd. Also when I checked in on Yelp I got a 15% of coupon so make sure you do that.   The Food  We got two pizzas since we couldn't decide. We had gotten the meatball appetizer in SF and it was great but we decided to skip it and try for dessert.   Cal Italia- this was the pizza we had in SF and it has haunted us ever since. It is a white style pizza with prosciutto and fig preserves, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. It sounds pretty weird I know but it is INSANELY good.  The Pizza Rock version did not disappoint.   The Ogden- this had olive, goat cheese, and sausage on a white pizza. I know what you are thinking \"two white pizzas?\"- and yes we went there. This was not quite as good as the Cal Italia- but still good. It could of been improved by adding some more goat cheese- some of the pieces had quite a bit, others almost none.  Chicken Parm- I didn't get this unfortunately- someone at the table next to me did. It looked so good I strongly considered cracking his skull open like a coconut and taking it before going on the lamb.   They have so many other unique flavors of pizza I will definitely be going back in order to try as many as possible.   Mud Pie- I saw someone else get this dessert and had to get it. It comes with some awesome flavored whip cream (grand marnier?) that is sort of orange tasting- highly recommend.",

The pizza here is excellent, everything I have had here has been fantastic I have never has anything I didn't love. They have a very good beer selection including several local micro-brews and many beers that I have not ever heard of. The cocktail list is equally impressive, the bartenders and wait staff alike are knowledgeable and friendly and the service is great. Pricing wise Pizza Rock is a bit on the pricey side but not too bad and the food more than makes up for it.

    "text": "My visit took place on Jan 01, 2015. I ate at the bar and watched the Rose Bowl.  But also know that I actually sought out this restaurant because more than one professional restaurant reviewer listed Pizza Rock as amongst the \"Top 10 Pizzas - 2014\" in Las Vegas. In addition, these writers noted that the restaurant has multiple pizza ovens - different ovens to facilitate the production of different styles (Neapolitan, Roma, New York, Chicago...) of pizza, and this caught my interest.  So let's start with the positives:  It has a great location. It is across the street from the Downtown Grand, or one block off of Fremont Street. So if you want to get away from the noise, and casino and chain eateries on Fremont Street without having to drive, it a good option.  The interior is well decorated. If you want to have a nice meal without distractions, you can.  And if you want to sit in an area with views of TV screens to monitor your sports team, you can.  The pricing is very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, and the service was also very good.  But with regards to the food.... I can only give \"an average\" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the Traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was doughy and more like fresh bread. The bottom (flat area) of the crust was \"wetter\" than I prefer. Maybe this is the new trend. (I also visited \"800 Degrees\" on the Las Vegas Strip, and experienced the same issue of wet crust.) Perhaps I need to try a different \"style\" of pizza next time?  Here's the bottom line: the place is nice enough that I am willing to go back and try another meal. And having read my review, the staff is friendly enough: you or I can describe the textures we want from our pizza to the server. They can suggest a style of pizza that is to your liking, or they can ask the kitchen to accommodate. And they do have other entrees besides pizza.  It has a full bar, and a good selection of standard and craft beers.",

Showed up at this happening little spot close to Fremont Street and was seated with no waiting early on a Saturday evening.  There are huge televisions all over the place and the crowd noise combined with the music was just below the obnoxious level.  I was able to enjoy the music and carry on a conversation without having to yell across the table.  I started my meal with a Moose Drool on tap. Excellent choice.  Followed that up with the 3 meatballs appetizer.  Next came the main course, the award winning Margherita pizza.  It was heaven sprinkled with fresh basil.  Props to all the other Yelpers out there whose reviews led me to this goldmine.",

However, Pizza Rock was the one who made the mistake and will not call the other party to tell them they made the mistake and the private room should be going to me. I am very disappointed by this customer service because they even told me who made the reservation first (me). Their employee didn't enter in the reservation correctly or someone changed it and I am at fault. The manager told me, \"There's nothing we can do\". My response was and still is, you can call the party who booked AFTER me and tell them you made a mistake. If I hadn't called to confirm then we would have shown up without the private room. We cancelled our reservation all together and will be taking our business elsewhere. I won't be back, that's for sure!",

I did order the burger but was disappointed with it . It was over cook and tasted like a Kobe blend rather than Kobe beef.

The group I was with ordered house salad, honey calabrese sausage, garlic bread, margherita pizza, the butcher, and old Chicago. Everything was AMAZING! I seriously almost cried eating that margherita pizza, because it brought back so many memories of my time in Italy. We had a person in our group who grew up in Chicago, and said the Old Chicago pizza was spot on & reminded her of her childhood. The next time I'm in Vegas I will be eating here again!",

Replace the Gorgonzola with goat cheese (unless you're a big fan of Gorgonzola I guess) the pizza is a perfect mix of sweet and salty.. It's so hard to stop eating. They also carry the stiel (I think that's the brand if not it's close to that word) grapefruit beer in a bottle it's super refreshing like an alcoholic Italian soda. You can also get slices up at the front if you don't feel like sitting down and waiting.. The slices up front are a little bit bigger than what you would get from a regular pie. Also if you are local ask for the locals discount I think it's 15% may be 10% though, we had been there like 4 times before anyone mentioned it to us.",

This is probably one of my few 4* Yelp reviews where I wouldn't hesitate to go back over and over again.   The margherita pizza was phenomenal.  Small, but amazing.  We ordered 3 for a group of 9.  We also had the New Yorker, which was also amazing.  Throw in a tomato pie and a few apps and we were all stuffed with leftovers",

Those were perfect in every way! Service was also good. Didn't catch his name but he did take off the pecan turnover from our bill since that thing was too big, too much pecans and served with little ice cream and overall not good. Glad it's coming off the list. I'm gonna give this place another try one day and try something different. Based on all their other reviews I'm kind of jealous on everyone else's satisfaction",

New York style was thin and fold-able as it should be, Detroit style was light and not heavy at all despite the thick crust.  The sauce was tangy and toppings were all of very good quality.  They have a great draft beer and appetizer selection.  The decor in the restaurant is slightly edgy and a lot of fun.  It adds to the dining experience.  Lots of very good menu options and of the best pizza you will find in Las Vegas.",

When we arrived there were around 20 open tables but they didn't seat us because of reservations that were still 25 minutes away, that's poor service if you ask me, and I have worked in the service industry.  By the time the 25 minutes were up they would have had additional tables open.  Needless to say, the reservations didn't fill the tables, then we were seated and our waiter wasn't the greatest, often times passing our table without acknowledging that I was trying to get his attention because my children had empty drinks.  I don't think I would recommend this place over places like Chicago Brewery in the 4 Queens....",

We tried 2 of their pizzas, the 'Cal Italia' which was a gold medal winner at Food Network's Pizza Champions challenge, and the Margherita, the 'World Pizza Cup' winner which for some reason they only make 73 per day. The Cal Italia was fantastic and lived up to the hype, the Margherita did not as the sauce was far too strong for my liking. They also have a decent selection of local beers, for those who are so inclined. If you're looking for good pizza at a reasonable price, skip the pizzerias on the strip and come to PIzza Rock.",

The staff was nice but we ordered 4 pizzas so we could try the different types and then 4 kid pizzas. The pizza took 40 mins for the first one to come out. Then they came only one at a time. It was over an hour before all 4 pizzas were delivered. And then the kids pizzas still didn't come. It took us 4 requests to them and then one came out a Mac & Cheese instead of a Cheese pizza and took another 10 mins. Asking for a refill took forever. We actually finally just went up to the bar to get the kids refills. They did end up taking the kids meals off the bill but still charged us the mandatory 18% gratuity. Which wasn't deserved.  Now on the other side the pizza was good when we finally got it. A bit pricey I think. $70 for one pizza, one salad, one Coke, and two Bloody Marys. We asked if we could buy it by the slice and they said only if you ordered it at the walk-up window outside ( huh???, whatever). And the place was nice inside. I would never go there again with a group or even kids at this point. So if it wasn't for the service which others have mentioned on here too. I would have given it 4 stars.",

    "text": "I do not know Tony Gemignani, except by reputation and have no affiliation with the restaurant.  After reading a couple of reviews I felt the need to rant. Unfortunately, many people who write reviews don't know food and are not that into food.  Their frame of reference is either limited or they really prefer the food the grew up with and think that's \"the bomb\" and nothing else is as good. Tony Gemignani is an 11 time world champion in pizza.  The first year he competed in Italy he swept the competition in all three categories, meaning he walked away with 3 gold medals, beating completion from Italy and all over the world.  So, obviously, the man knows pizza!!!! I had wanted to eat at one of his places for a few years, knowing his reputation, but they were all in central California, an area I never visit.  I was thrilled to learn that he was opening here in Vegas and ate there the end of October 2013. Everyone has an idea of what a crust should be like.  It's usually what they grew up eating, and anything else is lousy.  Tony has 3 ovens, a gas, an electric and a wood fired oven, all different temperatures.  The type of pie/crust you order determines which oven it will be cooked in. For me, a pizza nut, hands down the best crust I've ever had.  Nice crunch, air pockets, good chew and yet still light and airy. The quality is there on the toppings, cheese and sauce.  I did not eat anything else but the pizza so cannot comment on anything else on the menu.  I wish I could eat there twice a week.   You want terrific pizza?  Now you know where to go.",

One member asked to order a lunch item that was more expensive than the \"brunch\" menu which was only breakfast and was told no mimosa special if lunch was ordered.  Pizza Rock...brunch means breakfast AND lunch! Asked if there was any alternative to the country potatoes and was told no substitutions. Pizza crust was slightly burned and over crispy,  benedict was super dry even though asked for extra hollandaise. Everyone thought the food was \"fair\". Would have all been easier to deal with if our server was even remotely apologetic or sympathetic,  but not so much. On the plus side the different flavored mimosas were great!

I feel sorry for those that go to Vegas and never venture the newly renovated Freemont Experience.  I believe the owner of Zappos put in quite a bit of money to give some new life to this beaten up part of town, and let me just say, he did an amazing job!!  More of that in my other location reviews.    Went here before a night of bar hoping.  We ordered the Picante pizza and a Romana that included the parmesan/proscuitto/arugula section, the nutella/apple/walnut section, and the sausauge(?) and some other meat that i can't think of section.  We already ordered the regular calamari and the spicy calamari.  The picante lived up to it's name!  But it was so delicious.  It included chorizo, cholula hot sauce, jalapenos, and pepperchinis.  Highly recommend it if you like spicy food.  The 2nd pizza was amazing and really big.  All 3 sections were so good.  Great crust and great combination of toppings.  My favorite though had to be the calamari!  I love calamari but not every restaurant that carries it should serve it.  Pizza Rock calamari rocks!  The service was fast, efficient and friendly.  Our server took the time to explain the different pizza options (yes there are tons: New York, Chicago, California, Italian, Flatbread, Focaccia, etc).  Also, the decor and ambience was very fitting of the downtown area.  They actually have the cab of a Peterbuilt big rig in their restaurant and looks pretty cool.  It would look cooler if it were painted like Optimus Prime, but that's just my geek opinion. Definitely recommend you pay a visit and be prepared to have some out of this world pizza!",

We went here bcuz my daughters coworker knows she goes to Vegas every month and keeps asking \"Did you get to eat there yet?\" We finally made it not impressed at all. The hostess was polite and sat us really fast, the atmosphere and decor were great, and we had a good waitress. The problem was the food it was just ordinary. I had the kobe beef burrata burger, the beef was cooked exactly as ordered the flavors just werent there and it was greasy, i like my bacon crispy it was limp, the fries were tasty, my daughter had a pizza that was just ok.  But nothing that i would ever feel the need to go back for. The prices were good. Parking was easy just parked in the Binions lot and had it validated.",

We asked and they informed us it was a 20 minute wait. We didn't wait much longer than 15 minutes and we were seated right away.   I would give pizza rock a 4 on food and a 4 on service. For the first 15 minutes of us sitting we weren't sure who our server was but once we were greeted and got our order in, it was worth the 30-40 minute wait to get our food (it was really busy since it was Friday). Me and my bf ordered the Gorgonzola Fries (which were amaaaazing) and the fried artichoke (which was ok) and a Gorgonzola and Apple salad for starters (pretty good).  We then got the Cal Italian Pizza which was really good but we had so many appetizers we saved it for a late night snack.   They also had a DJ booth that was inside a truck in the dining area so that was pretty cool. The music was loud and all rock. In my opinion, it's a great place to hang out and drink! Also, if you don't like dining in there's a to-go pizza area so you won't need to sit in and have your food served. Patios outside as well if you're looking for some scenery outside.   Thanks Pizza Rock!",

Blonde, tatted, and gauged. She was on point with our large party of 13. Did not miss a beat.  The a/c was so cold... We tried to withstand it almost the entire time.

After complaining to the server about our burnt, soggy pizza, they were nice enough to give us a free box to take home. Sadly, this pizza was as burnt & soggy as the one we had.  Nothing usually tastes better than free, but not if the free thing is this burnt & soggy.  Hubby told the manager that from working in the kitchen for nearly 30 yrs., he knows this happens when the ovens aren't properly cleaned. Which is something that usually happens when a place is so busy that the cooks just rush through each order & can't find the time to clean the ovens between orders. The manager admitted it.  It was a busy night, so the service was just OK. Definitely not 1 of my fave pizza places in town. I liked Amore more. I'd probably go back for the Calamari. In my mind I've renamed this place to Calamari Rocks.",

It was very busy and we were concerned about a long wait. Just 2 of us were seated immediately and near the bar area at a high top table. Perfect! This place is bigger than it looks on the outside!   Service was fast and friendly. Drinks were average to a little pricy for the area. We wanted to split a pizza and it took a while to decide what type of pizza we wanted. Oh lord! They have every type of pizza imaginable! Neapolitan, New York, Chicago, Detroit, flatbread, Sicilian, stromboli! We chose a pizza you can't get anywhere else.....the Guinness and Sausage pizza.  Amazing choice! The crust is a hand tossed yeast dough, infused with Guinness beer, with a spicy sausage, caramelized onion and lots of cheese! The Guinness reduction drizzled on top was a great sweet balance to the spicy sausage and red pepper flakes.  We loved how original the pizza was!  Oh! We ordered the beer battered artichokes as an app and they were just ok. The batter needed more seasoning but the dipping sauce helped.  Overall, a great place for pizza. They even have late night slices for sale near the entrance.",

The area that this restaurant is in seems fairly safe, but keep an eye out just to be on the safe side.   Prices were a bit high, so we decided to split the Detroit Red Top ($27).    Our pizza was somewhat similar to a deep dish, the restaurant describes it as: \"Square Style Pizza Cooked in Steel Pans from Detroit, Wisconsin Brick Cheese, Mozzarella, White Cheddar,Tomato Sauce, Pecorino Romano, Oregano, Garlic, Butter Toasted Corners\"  This pizza is quite heavy, but it was extremely fresh and tasty.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.   The restaurant states that the pizza can feed 2-4 people, I would say that is accurate.  We left with 1/4 of our pizza in a takeout container.  This would probably be a great pizza for 3-4 people to split with salads or an appetizer.    Our waiter was good and very quick with our water refills.   We will likely try this joint again if we get back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Ok I'm writing the same review for both locations so here it goes again.! Pizza Rock is the best pizza restaurant in the city of Las Vegas hands down. Pizza Rock was started by a guy named Tony Gemignani who is a Triple Crown winner of International Pizza Championships in Lecce, Italy. He is also the 2007 World Champion Pizza Maker at the World Pizza Cup in Naples Italy. He's the first American and non-Neapolitan to win. To start I recommend ordering the classic meatballs or the Honey Calabrese sausage. Both are delicious. As far as pizza goes the must try is called \"Sausage & Stout\" it's made with Honey Malted Guinness Beer Dough, Green Onions, Crushed Red Peppers, Beer Salt and drizzled with a Sweet Guinness Reduction. It's amazing  they only make 23 a day so hurry. Another favorite is the Old Chicago which is outstanding. I get it well done and I add pepperoni. 3rd on my list is the Honey Pie. It has Mozzarella, Calabrese Peppers, Serano Pepper's, Green onions and local honey  topped with fried caramelized onions.! A few other popular choices are the Cal Italia Gold Medal Winner with Asiago, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Balsamic Reduction!  The Margherita which won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy Has San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO. Whatever you do don't go and order a cheese pizza, take a chance step out of your comfort zone and order 1 or 2 of their specialty pizzas. Better yet get some friends or small group and order 3 or 4 different pizzas so you really get the experience. It will change your entire view on pizza!    happy pizza hunting Ciao",

    "text": "Time to update my review after dining at Pizza Rock a 2nd time - this time for Sunday brunch.  On Sundays they now offer an \"Acoustic\" brunch, with live music.  My friend and I arrived just about 1pm and there was about a 10 minute wait for a table (it's a pretty large place, so this kind of surprised me).  Once we were seated I was a bit disappointed that we couldn't see the actual performers, but oh well.  We could hear him (them?) and it was decent.  It's a pretty standard brunch menu, but with a Pizza Rock spin on things.  I had a tough time deciding between the eggs benedict and the meatball hash, but decided on the hash (wish I'd have gone with the bene).  My friend ordered the french toast ambrosia.  I had the bacon bloody mary ($10) and she ordered the bottomless mimosas ($10), which were either orange juice, passion fruit or mango flavored.  Now, I didn't have the best experience the last time I ate here, so I've been hesitant to return.  Unfortunately, this time there were a couple of hiccups as well, but I am adding a star because these glitches were handled pretty well by our server.  So, my friend gets her food, but they don't bring my order.  The runner looks at the ticket and says \"looks like your meatball hash should be on the way.\"  Now, I don't necessarily believe that they should be delivering one diner's order and leaving the other person without food, but they probably didn't want her food to sit in the window getting cold either.    When I received my food, it was cold.  I  am guessing that it was ready when the other order was brought out, but the runner missed it.  Pretty disappointing, since I was starving - but I sent it back.  The waitress was very apologetic.  I wasn't upset, just hungry!  Since they were remaking my dish, the waitress brought a complimentary order of meatballs so I had something to snack on and didn't have to just sit there while my friend ate.  I was very appreciative and this was a great move by her!  Once my food came out, it looked nothing like the 1st order.  I think they had just messed up my original dish overall, because the 1st plate had no meatball, while the 2nd had tons of it.  There was a noticeable difference.  The meal itself was decent.  I probably wouldn't order it again, I prefer the more traditional hash.  My friend LOVED her french toast ambrosia.  It looked really good.  Something like 4 slices of french toast, made from their house made foccacia bread, and topped with TONS of fruit - strawberries, berries, bananas and cinnamon whipped cream.  My bacon bloody mary was ok, but for $10 I don't think I would order it again.  There was nothing really special about it.  The $10 bottomless mimosas (or sangria) are a much better option.  In fact, as it got closer to 2pm (when brunch ends), our server mentioned that she had the bartender make another pitcher of mango mimosa since my friend had not received any refills yet.  She made sure that she got a few more refills, even after 2pm.  Overall, the service was good.  Our server (Harmonie) was friendly and attentive and I appreciated that brought me complimentary meatballs when my dish was being remade.  They also removed my meal from the bill, which wasn't expected, but much appreciated.  I am still on the fence about this place - both times I've been, there has been quite a few hiccups.  They've been open long enough that there shouldn't be that many issues, but I know this stuff happens.  I just wish it would stop happening to me so that I could simply enjoy a meal here! :)",

    "text": "Yas Pizza Rock! I came here with a group after a conference. Since we had a large party, we were able to use one of the rooms for food, and people sat out in the dining area. There was pizza, bread, meatballs, and salad. I had cheese pizza, bread and salad. I don't know what kind of dressing was on that salad, but it was so good! The pizza was so hot and fresh! The guy just brought it out of the oven and placed it on the table. He said, \"I made it, so it must be good!\" He wasn't lying! It was very good! The pizza was huge, too. Fed enough people! I don't know how many slices I ate.   We also participated in happy hour. Of course. It was $2 off draft. The guy behind the counter was soo nice. Let us sample a beer we had never heard of. Ended up liking it, and drinking it...a few times. Everyone who works there has a genuinely positive attitude. They were willing to help. Anything that was needed was taken care of.   There is a section right when you walk in to order pizza, then head out. You don't have to stay. But why wouldn't you? They have good drinks, good music, WITH the video to go along with it, and good people. You're sure to have a good time!",

Fresh ingredients used throughout their menu. The meatballs are made daily and are light and tasty with their homemade sauce which has a base of Italian tomatoes. The bar was fun and the waitstaff and bartenders were ready to accommodate.   A place you should add wheen doing the Fremont Experience.",

The pizza turns out to be very good!! The toppings are fresh and customer service this time was excellent. I'm glad the owner takes customers complaint seriously and remediate quickly.

Customer service- will deduct 2 stars from 5 stars. Complaint: My party of three were in line inside the establishments ordering kiosk by the front door. Only one party of three was ordering in front of us. It took this party of three about 5 minutes to order. After they ordered, my party stood around like moo-moo's for another 5 minutes without any acknowledgment from staff or management. Management was standing by front desk chatting with each other the entire time and never took notice that we had been standing there unacknowledged for 10 minutes and the restaurant was not busy.  No, \"hello\", no \"we'll be right with you\", no \"Welcome!\". Nada.  These are the most stoic and non-verbal employees i've seen in a while. Not a peep or a smile in sight. Like manikins at a ROSS store. Is this normal at this location?  My patience was tested this day.

They have a full menu that offers vegetarian friendly items to the meat lovers delight so you can really please most. The service is always friendly and the food comes out quick which is even better. I've been there at different hours of the day from the lunch hour, happy hour, and the late night sober up hour and have received the same great customer service each time.   The happy hour is AWESOME! The portions of the appetizers on happy hour are the same large size such as the fried green beans (which you have to try).   Food Favorites: I have yet to have a pizza in all the crust categories that i haven't enjoyed but the fig and prosciutto with balsamic is amazing and a little of the sweeter side. The Brooklyn and Franknitti are great vegetarian options. You can never go wrong with a calzone, they're a little on the bready side but they're quite large. Appetizer wise I HIGHLY  recommend the Fried Green Tomato Caprese Salad (It shows they serve it at the downtwon location online however it used to be only at the GVR location). Calamari Fritti is quit tender and has a light fluffy fried batter and lastly the fried green beans are BOMB!",

    "text": "I'm really into fitness right now... fitness whole pizza in my mouth.    Went on Saturday 4-16-16 at 6PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on 3rd St. between Stewart and Ogden.  $30.17 got us a margherita pizza, a kid's spaghetti & meatballs, a caesar salad, and an iced tea.    The $7 caesar salad was just about the best one I've ever had...it was cold, crisp, perfectly dressed, and it was zesty....almost spicy! It took every ounce of my almost non-existent self-control not to lick the plate.   The $7 spaghetti and meatball from the kid's menu was a hit with my toddler.  He was covered in sauce and didn't even notice that I stole his meatball.  Sorry...not sorry.  It was like stealing candy from a baby...except it was a meatball.    The $17 margherita neopolitan pizza was incredibly fresh-tasting.  It was rather soggy and could have used a bit more cheese but it was still enjoyable.  I think for the price I'd rather go to Blaze or Pizza Rev & get unlimited toppings, a crispier pizza, and I could probably get two for this price.   Service was phenomenal and the atmosphere was super cool and chill.  This would be a great place to take out-of-towners or a date. Yay! I'm a fan!!",

Heaven in every bite. I really planned on taking a photo today, but couldn't get the pieces into my mouth fast enough. There just wasn't going to be time for photos.  Picture the most delicious seasoned thin crust. Crunchy but not brittle. Thin but not too much so that it can't handle toppings. Next add the perfect blend of tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, fresh basil, kalamata olives and goat cheese. *swoon*   Even my boyfriend, who after devouring his meatball sub and \"the greatest fries on the planet\" (seasoned with garlic), still asked for a bite. Though not gluten free himself, he's always willing to try everything I eat, and especially enjoys both homemade and store bought gf desserts I've shared.   He may have been ready to tease, but was immediately impressed. His reaction, \"Omg! This is a gluten free pizza that tastes like REAL pizza!\" Doesn't get any better than that.   Our server was sweet and attentive. The atmosphere is funky, friendly and relaxing. Prices are ideal. Locals are very lucky to have this place. We already look forward to our next trip, where I'll be ready to get an amazing pizza that is carefully(and separately) prepared by people who care about the gluten intolerant.  If visiting downtown Las Vegas, be sure to stop at Pizza Rock!! Your stomach will thank you.",

Happy hour is really cheap with deals on personal pizzas and meatballs. I just wish they would offer the personal sized pizzas all the time.",

On pizza we had was paper thin, which was fine, except with burnt hard hard crust, and way to much grease/oil. The other was a normal pizza, with what looked like drips of marshmallow on it- turned out to be cheese, ricotta I believe. Again crust burnt to a crisp and the taste was bland. The down town atmosphere was good, bar was ok, pizza, no so much. People come to Vegas to gamble, drink and party, not spend $32 on a pizza that tastes like hard shoe leather.",

I went for a single slice because their \"personal pizza\" was for/during happy hour.  So I went with what was available and tried the Veggie Pizza.  I love \"supreme\" type pizza's and I wanted to add pepperoni to it, but I couldn't.  It was sold \"as is\".    I took it back to my office, and I'm sure if I ate it there, it would be hot and taste fresh.  I took a bite of it, and thought, \"oh just like any other\" thin crust pizza.  But then I took another bite and started enjoying it even more.  I was sad at the end, because I went back in the box hoping another piece would magically appear.  I'm the type that likes veggie pizza and crunchy crust pizzas so, this pizza fit my likings very well.  I really wanted to order calamari as well, but didn't know if I'd have time to wait for it and still have time to get back to my office in time.  So I'll eventually one day come back to try other things or at least come back to try their happy hour. I do think they are a little pricey.  :\\  So with that being said, happy eatings! @~~}~~~~",

The server was very quick to make sure we knew that the pizza was thin and chewy and you'd have to use two hands to pick up a piece.  He also mentioned that because it's cooked over wood, it will be slightly charred. What we received was so far from an award winning pizza we were speechless.  The char was overwhelming and overpowered any other flavors that were part of the dough, sauce or toppings. When we let our server know that we weren't happy, the situation was handled extremely well.  The server loooked at the pizza and then smelled the pizza and let us know that there was definitely something wrong with the pizza that we were served.  They brought a second pizza (this time we had the New Yorker) and it was pretty good.  The manager went as far as to bring us a 2nd Margherita pizza so we could see what the pizza was supposed to taste like.  It was still overcharred on one side but we could defintely taste the flavors.  To be honest, I still wasn't impressed with this pizza. While we ended up not having to pay for our meal (which I thought was very nice and it was unexpected on our end) I thought the prices were high for a pizza joint.  So while the staff and management definitely recovered nicely from their error, in the end I just don't see what all the hype is about.",

You can get many many many different types of pizza.  There were just so many options.  I ended up keeping it simple and just got their normal pepperoni because I wasn't going to eat a lot.

On the first visit we ordered pepperoni pizza and Parmesan rosemary fries and Paardebloem beer (a pale beer with fruit undertones). Everything was tasty and I enjoyed my meal. On my next visit I went during late night happy hour. This time we ordered a Cal Italia    pizza, appetizer meatballs, flash fried green beans, and Parmesan rosemary fries.  I liked the pizza, which was a no tomato sauce variety with prosciutto, cheese and a balsamic vinegar drizzled over it.  Once again the fries were spot on and fantastic. The meatballs were tasty and the sauce was fresh tasting. I could see these on a great meatball sub with some mozzarella.  The green beans were crisp and had some garlic added for flavor. Green beans are not my most favored veggie, but I tasted them and they were not bad. I still loved the parm-rosemary fries the most of all. They were YUMMY!!!!!!  On my third visit, I had the Burratta Burger and more fries----yummy!! The burger was good and the bread was good too, it's large and I could not quite finish it all--- I tried though. :)  Overall I would say this is a great place. It's  very roomy, with a nice atmosphere and good food.",

No time to complain as the food took almost 20 minutes to arrive and we had a ballgame to go to. I would hate to be there when it is busy, i imagine the wait time for food could be much longer. Service could have been better, But waitress was nice. If a pizza place is going to serve burgers, they should be decent. MIne was terrible, i would not go back",

Honestly, I'm kind of obsessed with the dish. Got it on a craving/whim, and haven't gone back to the pizza since. They make their pasta fresh daily and the meatballs are so fluffy! Excited they just opened another location in Green Valley Ranch, as it is closer to my home.",

First I must mention the employees that work this counter seem to be really serious and proud of their pizza making which is no wonder because the cheese slices are delicious!! Also lots of people walking in for pizza slices to go. Very good and very close to New York style pizza.",

With so many types of pizza I was bound to love some/ hate some but I've found my jam. The Chicago style thin crust pizza is just the stuff I ordered growing up. So good and loaded with pepperoni, fennel sausage and spicy sausage. Perfect!  I have also discovered the happy hour menu and it's probably my favorite HH menu around town. 3 huge meatballs for $3 and a 1 topping personal pizza for $5 or specialty pizza for $7. Well drinks $3! Seriously. Awesome. Oh and the staff is always super friendly, especially at the bar.",

None of us have been here before so we were ready to dig into some pizza or \"za\" as my boyfriend would call it.   We all ordered a round of blue moons and each shared two pizzas. My boyfriend and I got the Cal Italia which had Challenge Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction. After our first bite, our tastebuds were roaring, it was delicious and a must try!   We also tried Old Chicago, which was very thin crust with Tomato Sauce Mozzarella, Provolone, Sliced  Meatballs, Garlic, Ricotta, Romano, Oregano. This one was okay, but we much rather had more of the Cal Italia!   Overall, Pizza Rock gets four thumbs up from us!",

I know they have a happy hour that starts late night (10? maybe?), and the sign out front says happy hour is only during the week, but the menus say happy hour is every day, and they let us order happy hour stuff no problem.  I think a quart sized can of PBR was $3 or something ridiculous.  The pizza was good, but nothing special.  Probably better than a lot of what you could get in the area though.  Great service.

We had gorgonzola fries that were out of this world and calamari that was crispy and mouthwatering. I must say the pizza was perfectly cooked and possibly one of the best i've eaten. We finished our meal with a scrumptious cookie gelato that hit the spot! With all that being said we'll definitely be back again soon!!!",

THIS spot gave me some hope in humanity. Actually, it knocked my socks off.  Last week, I met up with some friends for a chill Happy Hour and my friend suggested this spot. I was hesitant at first, but I'm down for an adventure.  Here's the breakdown:  Drinks -- Awesome Happy Hour. Ends at 6pm M-F.  My massive beers were $5.50. Clean beer lines, no skunkiness. Absolutely perfect. --$3 well drinks  Food -- Amazing! Get the meatballs. $3 for 3. They are swimming in marinara which was also fantastic. I don't usually care for marinara, so this stood out. -- Pizza: You MUST get the Cal Italia! Fig preserve, prosciutto, asiago etc. Amazing.  Ambiance --PERFECT. Great for groups, small and large. Music is fun and the TV's are MASSIVE. I'd definitely come back to watch a game here.  Service --Very accomodating. Our server was awesome and attentive without being annoying.

The atmosphere is upscale contemporary rock n' roll meets Harley Davidson. Cool, clean, enjoyable and not blasting with loud music or people. Our waiter, Dustin, was knowledgable of the menu and attentive. He listened to what kind of pizza we were looking for and made EXCELLENT recommendations! The pizzas were so delicious we stuck around for the gelato! Also amazing.   Overall if you are visiting Vegas or a local you MUST eat here! Great food, service and vibe!

Thin, New York, Sicilian, whatever... they'll have it plus different electric and wood ovens to boot. Their extensive menu can be overwhelming for those that are indecisive, like me. So, it's best to peruse the menu ahead of time or just let someone else order. The Cal Italia ($18) was the best pizza I tried with its rich flavors from the sweetness of the figs to the savoriness of the prociutto. I also enjoyed the quail egg white rose potato guanciale ($18) even though I'm typically not crazy about spicy foods. The Roma III ($32) is great if you're in the mood for an appetizer, entree, and dessert pie all in one. Although the middle section with the cream sauce and meatballs was the main standout for me. Not so impressive were the margherita ($16) and farmer's market (pumpkin puree, cinnamon, marshmallow). Our group even had room for dessert. The pecan turnover and apple calzone more than satisfied my sweet tooth. The mud pie, after chiseling away at it, was a letdown. It only succeeded in making me feel guilty for consuming all those calories. So, while dishes were hit or miss, there's enough promise to warrant a return visit.  3.5 Stars",

The first visit was at about 11pm on a Wednesday night after a few hours taking in the public spectacle that is the Freemont Street Experience.  We were looking for something quick and easy. That is precisely what we got. They sell by the slice all day, but at that point in the evening, you get what you get & you don't throw a fit.   But what we got was a nice thin crust with plenty of yummy toppings.   Our second visit was a dinner party with approximately 35 people. There were multiple pizzas ordered, so I tried three. The pizza that stood out for me is their Cal Italia (I now know this is a gold medal winner on The Food Network pizza challenge). Oh my!!  If you go - you MUST try a slice of this one. Only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is because the service for our big group was a bit lack luster. We waited too long for drinks & refill. The food, however, is 5-stars all the way.",

The waiter was super cool.  I actually felt a bit too old but oh well lol  We ordered The Butcher, which is all the meats that you can think of Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Bacon, Linguica, Italian Sausage, Mortadella, Hot Coppa and Prosciutto oh and it had sauce and cheese too.  The pizza came out and it smelled amazing!!!  One bite and I was in love.  It was so yummy that you knew it was bad for you but I didn't care  The crust was perfect and crisp.  Not thick so that you feel like you're eating a sandwich.  They don't skimp on the toppings -- it was loaded.  I took a picture but the picture doesn't do it justice.  It made our list of places that we will definitely come back to!  My husband gave it a 4  I gave it a 4   So a 4 it is =)",

We went on a Sunday evening, didn't have to wait for a table and the place was busy. Our waiter Bradley was great!  + We ordered Truffle fries to start. Super tasty! They went fast!! We tried 2 different pizzas: Margherita Napoletana style & Sam Giancana Chicago style. Both we very tasty and cooked perfectly!   - The only area which I could recommend improvement would be to try and have the pizzas come to the table at the same time. It was almost a 10 minute difference between the 2 pizzas.   We are looking forward to returning to try new favorites.",

The sausage was absolutely delicious and the mini pepperoni were nice and crisp. The sauce compliments the meat flavors well and the ricotta cheese just rounds everything off. The 6 slices were fairly large and the pizza itself was 16\". Also ordered the hazelnut kiwi pizza ($13) since they have a special brunch menu on Sunday's. It had peanut butter, Nutella, some sort of jam, strawberries, Fuji apples, and bananas. It was more of a dessert type of pizza. Recommend for kids but not really a meal. Overall a wonderful meal and highly recommend.   *Note: Don't park at the lot right adjacent to the restaurant! That lot charges $20 for 1 hour of parking. Find parking at a hotel for MUCH cheaper.",

    "text": "Wow, really? In the middle of Vegas? I find a restaurant that serves a True Neapolitan pizza? I am truly amazed.   I'm here visiting Vegas with my 19 month old while my husband is here training so I did a yelp search to find somewhere to have lunch. When I saw this place pop up on my search I initially wrote it off because I haven't had many good experiences with Neapolitan pizzas in the US (of all the States I've visited, Portland surprisingly had the most delicious Italian style pizzas). Anyway going back to my yelp search, I saw that the owner/chef here won a pizza award in Naples (side note: my husband's father is from Naples, so we visit the city often) so I knew I had to try this.  I ordered a house salad (which the waitress told me was half a Caesar salad), meat balls and the Neapolitan margherita pizza with bufala mozzarella. They were all delicious!! The meatballs were devoured by my 19 months old son. I thought they were beautifully made and the marinara sauce was just perfect. The pizza dough was just the way I like it and should be, soft and chewy with a bit of char to it. Mmmmmm I dipped the leftover crust in the meatball sauce, genius! Ahaha  I was pleasantly surprised, and at the same time amazed that anyone here in Vegas could really appreciate this food. No offence. But Americans (I'm a Brit/Japanese) prefer American style pizzas. I'm sure that's why this place offers different styles of pizza from Cali to NY pizzas. I'm not a fan of those so I didn't try them. But I've no doubt that everything on the menu is delicious here.   I hope Pizza Rock expand into Los Angeles so I can eat this every week! I saw that SLS hotel is going to house 800 degree pizza from Spring 2014 so seems like there'll be some competition starting next year.",

Crust was top notch and sauce on point. Cheese...tough to tell the quality as happens with fresh mozzarella baked too hard (900 degrees wood-fired). Next time I'll just go for a quick slice at the slice window and avoid the bitchy restaurant girls. The manager chick tried to challenge me when I asked for parking validation. Hey, B, when you make the trek downtown just to hit Pizza Rock during the worst sand storm of the decade, you better not gripe over  bloody parking. F-That. Even the pizza guys seemed stretched beyond their limitations. Disappointed first visit. Hear that, Tony?",

We came in 20 mins later and were told they don't start the margherita until you come in which they did not tell us that over the phone. If they informed us, we would have gone straight there.  We paid and we waited another 10 minutes. Unsure if the guy in the Slice House area was making it or if it was being made in the back from Pizza Rock. I heard the guy shout to the other that he asked for the margherita 10 minutes ago. Other guy said he burned the first one and had to start over. Thanks for letting us know (except we had to overhear it to even find out why we've been sitting there for close to 20 minutes extra).  Pizza at $18, small, and with bad service earns them one star!

Huge selection of IPAs and wine --- I knocked down a couple of the Imperial IPAs and at 8.9% alcohol, they took the edge off after a long day, haha.   Menu is loaded with every type of pizza and Italian dish --- Chicago style, New York, thin crust, gluten free, etc. etc. etc. --- it took me forever to decide but I finally settled on the Carne Totiro and was absolutely delicious.   I went back with a few buddies last month and we were not disappointed. We ordered one of their larger pies, loaded with meat and veggies and we couldn't finish. Great way to start the night!  If you're in DTLV and you're looking for a solid place to eat, drink, watch sports and people watch --- Pizza Rock is an awesome option. I do not travel to LV often but I will definitely make it a point to hit this place up again when I back in the city.",

    "text": "One of the best and cheapest pizza slices that you can find in all of Las Vegas. Located in Downtown LV, this place has massive slices and unique combinations. I always go for the Picante slice because it comes with Cholula sauce, dollops of ricotta cheese, pepperoni, chorizo, banana peppers and jalapenos. We usually grab it togo, but if you choose to dine in then they have great drink selections. The cool thing is that they have front end of a big rig truck inside of the dining room. As for the service, everyone from the guys at the to-go counter to the hosts are super chill. Overall, if you are looking for an epic slice of pizza in Las Vegas then Pizza Rock is the place to go.",

But my main issue is not just with the speed of service, which was slow, but just the quality. Server seemed to hate his life and very much reflected in his ability to serve us. Italian Chopped salad was just about the worst salad I ever had, almost no dressing, and just just thrown together as an after thought. Pizza was decent, but over priced.  Overall experience was weak. Overpriced, bad service, music too loud, trying to be more hip than it is. Won't be back, too many better options in the area.",

The margherita pizza is apparently certified as official by Italy and they're limited to making 77 a day. Not sure if that's True but it's a must try, not too much cheese, just classic pizza taste without being too greasy or heavy. They have a Jalapeno beer on tap too, it's interesting and worth a try. Be sure to check in on Yelp for 15% off your bill.",

I liked the atmosphere out on the sidewalk, and the fact that they have a take out window. We'll definitely go again. We enjoy going downtown every so often, and usually park at the adjacent lot by Mainstreet Station. Sometimes, it's free, and sometimes it's not. Either way, it's easy and we'll just walk around from there. The two drawbacks from this experience is the take out window needs some adjustments. The timing and execution of placing an order, paying, and then receiving it was confusing, backed up, and a bit disorganized. Perhaps, once they get into the groove then this will sort itself out. Also, I had no idea they offer a 20% local discount. This wasn't offered when ordering, nor did I see a display of the offer.",

We were downtown checking out the Container Park (great spot, by the way) and we wanted to eat inside since it was getting chilly outside, and most of the containers don't have much indoor seating.  We quickly found this place without knowing much about it.  The food was great!  We had a Cal Italian (I think?) pizza - it had figs, a few cheeses, balsamic vinegar, and prosciutto - very yummy!  (Surprisingly, my kids even liked this and it had gorgonzola in it, which is pretty amazing, since most kids won't touch that sort of cheese, right?)  It could have used a little more prosciutto.  But the flavors were awesome - sweet, salty, and savory all together.  I love foods like that!  For the kids, we got them just a regular classic pepperoni/cheese pizza to share instead of ordering off the kids' menu, which they liked.  They have a large draft beer selection (I had the Moose Drool), and kid's drinks (if you don't buy off the kid's menu for a meal deal) are $1, which I always appreciate.  The music was fun, and the atmosphere here is a touch nicer than your average pizza place (crystal chandeliers with awesome red leather and black laquer chairs - very funky/fancy/fun).  I would definitely come here again, either if we are doing fun stuff downtown or are meeting up with friends downtown and want to be a little off the Freemont Street scene but still downtown.",

All i wanted was a slice or two but the smallest pie that they have is really for 2-3 people. None of the wait staff mentioned that you could get pizza by slice at the front counter. Other than that it was great. There was live music and service was prompt and attentive. The pizza was good but not excellent. It had a decent crust that was crisp and just thick enough to hold the cheese without being a mess. The cheese was a bit salty and little firm, so you didnt get that nice gooie cheese one would expect. I would eat again but i will continue to look for a better slice in vegas.",

OHMYGAWD!  these were AMAZING and i am drooling as i type this. seriously, if you like green beans, you have GOT to try these.  as we were happily crunching on these pieces of joy  in between occasional moans of absolute contentment, the manager or owner came over, introduced himself, apologized, asked us if we liked our green beans (which should have been obvious as our eyes were practically rolling in our heads) and then proceeded to tell us that the entire meal would be comped except our alcoholic drinks.  WOW!  we were happy to hear that, obviously. me especially as i had just spent a small fortune on having a great vegas time with my daughter!  and while we continued to wait, he kept us interested in his experience with micro brewed beers and gluten free beer much to the delight of my daughter, who is a connoisseur, and then he proceeded to tell us the interesting story of how pizza rock came to be.  our pizza finally arrived and he discreetly left, and once again my mouth waters as i type this.  i never thought i would be a fan of gluten free pizza but this was absolutely delicious.  and i come from chicago, where chicago style pizza is a delicacy.    all in all, i am giving this place 5 stars because of the excellent food, and how a manager or owner took what could have been a negative experience and turned it into a fun and memorable evening out with my daughter.  that is a skill, and an art!  we will be back!",

I ordered delivery, which is through Grub Hub, the order arrived incomplete and I also had to walk down to the lobby to retrieve the order. I am staying at The Grand so it is literally across the street. I called the restaurant to inform them of the mistakes in missing an item and the delivery charge that could have been a pick-up. Brittany, the MOD, had every excuse possible and then said that she was too busy to take care of the situation! She said she would call me back without even taking my phone number...no way, ma'am! I called Grub Hub and they refunded the ENTIRE amount because of the inconveniences. Brittany learn this!   Pizza Rock, I love you and you are awesome...maybe Brittany is not so much any of this!",

The Downtown location is huge, and convenient for those who are on the go and just want to try a slice.  We dined in and were able to try a variety of tastings such as the meatballs, fried green beans, garlic bread, and of course, pizza! The meatballs were on point and went perfectly with the garlic bread. I don't feel like I have a fair judgement on the pizza because I was so stuffed by the time we were done with the appetizers!   Overall a really great location and I would definitely return, maybe to Henderson, since it's a bit closer for me.",

    "text": "Pizza Rock is one of the better pizza places in town (Naked City is still #1 for me). I really like variety when it comes to pizza, and Pizza Rock certainly has variety. The only problem with variety is that it can be a challenge to agree on a pizza when ordering for a group. They don't do half pizza which is unfortunate, but their pizzas are small enough to order a few for the table, though they can get expensive. A few coworkers and I came for lunch on a Tuesday and ordered the Fratellanza ($32). This is one of the only large pizzas they have (technically \"giant Sicilian style\"). The pizza was indeed giant and is said to serve up to 5 people. Well, I had two slices and my two coworkers finished off the rest so if you're super hungry this could easily fill up 3 people. The slices came in a square shape with thick, slightly overcooked crust. It was simple pizza but great flavors. Could have used a few more mushrooms. I highly recommend this for anyone not knowing what to order because the others are a bit overwhelming.   Pizza Rock has a great beer selection but the prices are steep. I ordered a weiss draft beer for $8.50 and my coworker got a bottled 12 oz Weihenstephaner for only slightly less. Even their local beers are around $7.50. Can't order very many of these at that price. I guess the only other thing that turns me off about Pizza Rock is the decor and theme. It feels really Hard Rock Cafe to me. Combined with the prices it makes me only want to come here on special occasions because it's more of an event or comparable to a Strip restaurant. The pizza is really good though and if I'm downtown and it's late I have been known to stop by their takeout counter. The Picante by the slice is amazing.",

I was hopeful for a salad with no dairy (which they messed up) and a vegan pizza they promised to make gluten free which ended up literally being burnt crust a thin smear of red sauce and whole garlic gloves but none of the veggies the menu promised or hey any vegan \"cheese\" or toppings that most pizza chains in CA provide. All in all, I couldn't wait to leave and eat an actual dinner after I left the company dinner.   I would recommend if you advertise a vegan friendly pizza you get \"cheese\" that is easily obtainable at any grocery store not made of dairy or soy and do more than a burnt shitty pizza. Pic to follow of the shame.",

Unfortunately, they didn't have one of the slices we wanted to try, but we got the picante and the Silician slice of the day.   The pizza was mediocre. The toppings weren't fresh. The mozarella cheese tasted like any Costco pizza cheese. The only bright part of this pizza was the dough. It was fermented and aerated well.   This pizza place is below my personal par, because I can list at least three better locations in my neighborhood in La Jolla, CA. Regents, Tony's, and probably as good as craft.   If you want a late night slice of pizza, this place is worth a try. But don't expect genuinely tasting New York slice.",

Kind of a hole in the wall location- but the pizza is amazing. We ordered a single classic- Pepperoni and I ordered the special purple potato.  The slice was New York Style, thin but chewy and had some chard edges.  Super massive slice. Very filling. We honestly loved it so much we came back the next day and ordered 2 pizzas to go.  The only down side is the parking situation, and on the second day when we came back the costumer service was meh. Still I would say the Best pizza I've had West Coast. I can't wait to go back. I wish there was a location in So Cali...!",

The beer battered artichokes were tender and paired well with the aioli.  We chose the New Yorker as it was voted winner of \"Best Tradition Pizza in the World\" at the Las Vegas Pizza Expo. I definitely recommend this pizza. The house made fennel sausage was very flavorful and the cheeses blended the flavors together.  Quality pizza and added with their hot pepper olive oil made it on point.  We had a server in training that was her first day and although she hadn't tried all the menu items to make any suggestions other than what she tried she was going to have someone provide us with recommendations.  Server was friendly and checked in periodically.  Atmosphere was good with a variety of genre of music. There were enough TVs playing different sports.  Overall we had a good experience, enjoyed the food and would definitely go back to try other items on the menu.",

First of all, I totally understand wanting to be downtown by action, but wow I'm not really a fan of the parking situation! They do have limited spaces available right near the restaurant, but mostly you have to find parking in one of the garages around Fremont Street.  When we walked in the front door we were immediately greeted by three hosts. They were all smiling and genuinely seemed to enjoy their job! It was nice to see! We were sat at a nice little table for two within full view of the bar. I'll have to try sitting at the bar next time, everyone looked like they were having fun!  Our server was very nice and attentive. She made suggestions since it was our first time. We started off with the garlic garlic bread. Yummy!!! It came out piping hot on a bread board. The slices were nice and thick, nicely buttered with chunks of fresh garlic. So much carbs, but ohh so good!  The pizza we decided to try the La Regina. I wanted to try something different since I'm used to eating thin crust pizza. It took about 20-25 minutes to come out, which is typical if you want your pizza nicely cooked. The Regina was huge! Like a pillow!! It had the right amount of sauce, and the salami and arugula tasted fresh and delicious! I had not one complaint!   Again, our server was very sweet and attentive without being overbearing. She kept my fiances drink refilled, and made sure I was ok with the cider I ordered. My only regret is not leaving room to try dessert! I'll definitely be back to dine at Pizza Rock again!",

No wait at all. We got right in. Got our drinks ordered (more on those later) then we got a new server. Nice guy, lousy waiter. I hope he's a dancer or an actor because waiting tables, he'll starve. Slow service, never came back to follow up, we had to actually go to the bar to order a 2nd round of drinks. there were only 4 other tables in the place though 1 was a party of 6. however we were all by each other. so sorry but only 2 **  Food: We had the truffle fries: Excellent! not too truffly to overwhelm. We went with the classic Pepperoni x-cheese & sauce: perfection - Just like my favorite NYC brick oven pizza. The right amount of crust to topping ratio. Not a tough dough, just a good chew. We want to go back to try some of their specialties like the   SPACCA NAPOLI or the Picante. Tiramisu: just the right amount of soaked ladyfingers to alcohol. 5****  Drinks: We were excited to see bacon bloody Marys on the menu. *if you follow me, you know i'm the queen of bloody Marys in Vegas* so of course we ordered 2. Nicely garnished with a very nice hearty piece of perfectly cooked bacon (not some floppy end under cooked piece* and a seasoned rim. Then we tested it. heavy aftertaste in the bloody Mary mix. Not nearly as good as even Mrs. T which is pretty inferior. But I finished mine & my son's. He wanted a shot & by then I'd had 2 might as well go for a 3rd, eh? we waited. and waited. & someone took the 'dead soldiers' we asked for our waiter. and waited. and waited. finally I (after 2 bloody marys) went to the bar to order. He brought them over without even questioning why i had ordered them from the bar. 2 **   Bill:  3 bloody marys & 1 shot  & 1 soda.  1 classic pepperoni  2 split appetizer  1 dessert  AND  1 additional pepperoni to go for dinner tonight *yum*   62.50.  this was with a 15% local discount and an additional 5% for checking into their facebook page.  that's another 5*****   So worth the trip. But please if you are reading this from Pizza Rock, step up your bloody Mary game. :-)",

    "text": "YUMM. So glad Diana W. introduced us to Pizza Rock. This is highly recommended for anyone looking for a delicious place to eat in Downtown LV!  We came just in time for Happy Hour (M-F 3pm-6pm) and they had such great deals! I can't remember the prices exactly but they were very reasonable especially for the quality and quantity of food that you get!   Classic meatballs - who doesn't want juicy and hot balls made in house? ;) Delicious and fresh, if you're a fan of meatballs, you should try these. Truffle Italian fries - large portion and you can definitely taste the yummy truffle! Calamari - also large portion and comes with aioli and marina sauces Cal Italia pizza - OMG. I was very hesitant to order this since I wasn't that hungry and usually don't like pizzas without tomato sauce but since it's deemed a \"Gold Medal Winner\" of the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge, I knew I HAD to try it.  So nobody wanted to share this personal size pizza so we pretty much all ordered our own and let me tell you, i'M SO GLAD I DID. The ingredients were so unique, I never thought a combination of prosciuttio, fig (and I don't even LIKE fig) and balsamic reduction could taste SO good.  I was too full to finish it at the restaurant, so I took my leftovers home and heated it up the next day in the toaster oven and it was still DELICIOUS. AS. EVER.  Tiramisu - served in a martini glass, it was delicious, light and fluffy! I usually don't love tiramisu but the cake was so soft and fluffy, my spoon kept going back for more.  I would highly recommend coming here for happy hour (I believe they have late night happy hour from 10pm-close as well, just call and ask) or coming here for a meal. Their menu is filled with plenty of delicious and unique pizza and pasta options so if you're an Italian lover, you must come. The restaurant is pretty big so it's great for large groups and there's also bar seating. Lots of TVs = good place to keep men entertained while you chow down lol. It feels like a chain restaurant but DO NOT be fooled, their food is beyond and very worthy. Make sure you check it out and you MUST. GET. THE CAL ITALIA!!",

    "text": "I've been to the one in Sacramento a handful of times when I'm there for conferences. I was happy to bring my family here for our trip to Downtown. It seemed more pricey than I remembered, but I think that was just based on our choice. I do not recommend the large pizza they say serves 6. It's 6 slices for $40 of a basic pizza. Stick to the slices in this case. You can split most of the pizzas there with one other person, especially if you split an app too. We'll definitely do this again next time we go in.  Oh, the wait was about an hour. We explored the Fremont Street Experience during that time and we were greeted with a phone call from Pizza Rock when our table was ready. They waited ten minutes for us to walk over and were happy to hold the table. Great service! Also, Lone Star is on their beer menu. The National Beer of Texas!",

Just a tip, they play they music videos with the songs, & they try to play the clean version of the songs. Keep that in mind if you have kids. Also, it took us like an hour to find parking. We found a parking lot which you can park at if you want to pay $20 bucks an hour. When we first got to Pizza Rocks, they said the wait was 45 minutes, but we got in within 10 minutes. Still don't know why, but it was helpful! Also, there is only indoor seating. Overall though, it was a good visit! Try Pizza Rocks sometime when your in Vegas!",

I'm not a green bean guy, but their green bean appetizer is delicious.  For their pizza's I recommend the Honey Pie or Margarita.  There was a limited release Guiness flatbread they had during late fall, but I think its off now.  If you are feeling adventurous try out the clam pizza.  (Make sure you like clams/seafood first.)",

The guy who called me sounded short, and passed me off to someone else to re-order who didn't know the rest of my order.  Ended up with the PICANTE, which was very meh, and we quite literally ordered Dominos later that day to make up for it.  Maybe their inside quality/service is better, but don't offer online ordering of food you won't deliver and only offer what you can ensure is a high quality.  After refusing to deliver, I expected a quality that wasn't there.  The ceaser salad was pretty good.",

The decor was inviting so much so that you barely notice the truck looking like it came through the wall. We were surprised with the size of the establishment that the noise level was low and that they understood what \"background\" music is supposed to be.  We had the calamari for an appetizer and did half normal, half spicy. \"Spicy\" is in the taste of the beholder and we found theirs was hot enough to grab your attention but not too strong that you can't finish it. One of the best I've tasted. For our main course we had the calzone  and the Stromboli. Both were tasty. The dough was light and not too chewy. With the 15% off through Yelp, this meal was definitely an excellent value.",

We had reservations for 8 and were seated right away. The service, atmosphere and food all top notch. Warm and inviting and at the same time efficient. There was a VJ on the night we were there playing (from the inside of a semi tractor which is in the restaurant) a mix of old school rock and new school parodies - very fun! When the pizza came it was beautiful. Served up on a cutting board you could smell the rich aromas of sausage, caramelized  sweet onion and tomatoey goodness. The crust was light and crispy outside with a soft sweet still light center. I was told that the Guinness reduction in the crust and topping is what makes it so delicious. It adds a sweetness but very subtly and perfectly offset by the sausage and herbs with big gobs of melted mozzarella - YUM. A must do meal if you are in old Las Vegas - great location just all the activity on Fremont St",

We have collectively had the chorizo mussels, classic pepperoni pie, arugula and pancetta salad, and the Calabrese burger. All of the items far exceeded my expectations! Upon this visit, I shot away from my previous orders of the margarita pie. The several times that I had ordered the margarita, it arrived cold. The classic pepperoni pie was hot fresh delicious and nicely cheesy. The burger was cooked perfectly and with the peppers on the side was not too hot. The arugula and pancetta salad was simple yes inspired. The chorizo mussels were in a creamy sauce we couldn't help but mop up with our pizza crusts. Overall, I love this place! Great addition to the list of lunch spots in my hood.. 15% off your bill with a check in on Yelp! Don't forget to take a dessert calzone home with you.. it is amazing.",

My not so favorite things were the focaccia was wayyyy garlic-y and the music was crazy loud.  I sound like an old person and I get that it is a rock and roll themed place.

    "text": "Ashley is the biggest reason we keep coming back! Someone needs to promote that girl already! My girlfriend, best friend, and I came to Pizza Rock for the first time and were blown away by the service Ashley and the rest of the staff gave us.  We went a few nights ago and received the same amazing service. If you ever go here ask for her... guaranteed to get top notch service and you'll get an honest opinion on the food.  It is hard to come by a place that has a consistently good vibe like that. We all work in the hospitality and service industry and we just want honest service where the staff doesn't try to sell you the most expensive item on the menu.  If that is what you like when you go to get food and drink then go here.  The pizza is  phenomenal and the beer and spirits selection is actually pretty top notch as well. Being a local in Vegas means it is hard to find a place downtown or on the strip that has a good beer selection when you have microbreweries in the suburbs.  Beware though... If you don't want to feel the nostalgia of 90's and early 2k rock music then I would go to the bar first and still get a drink from Ashley at the very least.    Overall the people that work there seem to always be enjoying their environment and they enjoy each other so that translates via the food and service in great ways.  Thank you Ashley for giving us a new spot to frequent. We will definitely be back soon!",

What's really nice is if you're with a group, the pizzas have the number of servings listed on the menu.  Their pizzas are delicious, but I didn't have a group to share with today so I ordered their Italian Trio Sandwich and then upgraded my fries to the Gorgonzola fries.  If you like Gorgonzola cheese, you absolutely MUST try these fries.  They're so addictive, I actually dream about them!  The Italian Trio sandwich is the perfect blend of flavors and has a little kick with the banana peppers and peppadews.  Definitely a great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner!",

Our waiter (who claimed to also be vegan) recommended the Verunda (sp?) without cheese, so we went with that and a side salad with balsamic vinegar and pepper. The sauce at Pizza Rock is pretty good, but for real, that crust is ridiculous. A little charred, chewy, and delicious. I'm glad he suggested it. The only other option on the menu was the Marinara, which was almost literally just sauce on bread.   Good stuff. I'm not even really bothered by so few options because the *one* (well, two) option they do have on their exhaustive menu is really good.",

Lots a pizza types, different crusts, different toppings but all tasty.  We started with two salads. HOUSE SALAD - Mixed Greens, Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onions, Mozzarella, Croutons and Balsamic Vinaigrette.  This was so good.  Loved the dressing and all of the ingredients.    CLASSIC CAESAR - Hearts of Romaine, Croutons, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Caesar Dressing.  I did not have any of this but the group loved it.  For pizzas, we got a variety so we could try different things.  MARGHERITA - San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Sea Salt and EVOO.  This was so tasty.  The crust was crisp and soft at the same time.  Good tomato flavor.    NEW YORKER - Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, House Made Fennel Sausage, Pepperoni, Garlic, EVOO, Oregano, Pecorino-Romano and Ricotta.  Yum.  The sausage was spicy but tasty.  Loved all the cheese on it.  Chicago Cracker Thin Pepperoni - loved the thin crust.  Good pepperoni flavor.  Nice to having something thin with all of the thick choices.  Giant Sicilian Style House Made Focaccia with Pepperoni - this was delicous.  Even though it was thick, it was not heavy.  Definitely good for a big group.  THE VEDURA (VEGGIE) - Vine-Ripened Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sauteed Spinach, Mushroom, Caramelized Onions, Garlic, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Shallots, Green Onions and Feta Cheese.  Our vegetarian really liked this.  Lots of good veggies on top, good flavor.  Good service overall.  Good food.  Fun place.",

Got in a late snack session!

The Pizza Rock Meatballs were huge!  3 per order was a nice serving for the 2 of us!  They were somehow meaty, delectable, but still light!  So tasty!  And their red sauce!  Double tasty!  I made sure to sop that sauce up with my Zucchini Fries!  The Zucchini Fries were good too, lightly breaded, fresh zucchini - a bit of kick in the dipping sauce too.  The Tony 2 Times pizza we shared was good too!  Their crust is very good, yeasty but still chewy with a nice crunch thanks to the cook in the wood oven.  Lovin' those bits of char on the crust!  Quality toppings on there too, the pepperoni had great flavor.  Wifey and I managed to only finish 1/2 the pizza!  Took the rest back to our hotel room for a snack later...which didn't make it because the kids ended up devouring it!  Oh well.  Here's why I had to give it less than a 4 star rating.  The service was a bit off.  Our server herself was nice, but her manager was not clear on certain things.  We had a Yelp coupon with check in that was supposed to give us 15% or 20% off our bill.  Redeemed it with our server.  She came back later saying that her manager told her the coupon has been expired on Yelp for nearly 2 years so we couldn't use it.  Seriously, almost 2 years??  Wouldn't Pizza Rock have taken care of this by now with Yelp?  Or at least put a sign up at the hostess desk when arriving?  I couldn't have been the 1st one to check in there and have the coupon pop up.  I didn't believe her but whatever.  I did air my displeasure in this, so our server went back to talk to the manager.  She came back and said the manager approved 10% off our bill.  I was great, that works, much appreciated.  Went on with our Happy Hour.  Our check comes - and no 10% discount!  Now I'm a bit confused, as well as a bit irritated.  It even bothered my wife a little bit.  So I have to ask our server again what happened to our discount, and she kinda has to answer us that she'll call the manager over.  OK...sure.  Manager comes over, and of course I ask her what happened to the 10% off the check that she approved earlier - she tells us that she can't do that because we only ordered off the Happy Hour menu!  It is already at a discounted price.  Such an inconvenience!  That kinda pushed my button, you were hoping I wouldn't read the cost of the bill or something?  You should have approached us BEFORE the bill came out and told us that the 10% discount you approved earlier wouldn't apply here because of the Happy Hour pricing.  Then we would have probably understood and been OK with it.  The service overall left a bad taste in our mouths with all the run around.  We haven't been back to Pizza Rock since then, and honestly not in a rush to do so.  Likin' the food, but the overall service needs a bit of clean up.  And for Pizza the Hut's sake - remove that supposedly 'expired' check in coupon from Yelp!!  Like...now please!",

    "text": "I have started avoiding all pizza except neapolitan 900-degree wood oven pizza, because making a great neapolitan is an art, and great neapolitans are like radiant mandalas of near-psychedelic ecstacy.  I had avoided Pizza Rock the first couple days staying at the Grand next door,  because during the day, the joint was empty - - and loud, and dark - - couldn't imagine sitting there at a table like a stooge.  The last night in Vegas, with the vintage hot rod show outside, needed some tucker so took a stool up front by the slice counter (thanks, Yelper Lauren T for this recommendation!)  and ordered the Sicilian slice of the day (deep crust - - foccacia?) and the Picante (basic 'American style' slice).  OH MY BLOODY HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GRACE were these slices great.   Pizza Rock is not so much pizza as art - - it is pizza as SCIENCE,  and the science at Pizza Rock is not myopic test tube, it is more like transcendent astrophysics.  The Sicilian had a crust that was solid and toothy, but then disassembled as you bite into it - - a crunch and a melt at the same time, with beautiful light delish tomato accent.   This is a pizza with a structure like the scaffolding that held Michelangelo up while painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  The Picante presented itself modestly - - simply a thinnish slice studded with eye-poppingly colorful toppings with bright white mozzarella blobs - - a slice from a larger pie, re-heated 30 seconds before being served - - and the message was clear:  at Pizza Rock they have the formula.  They know precisely what they are doing with the alchemy of crust and topping (and top, top ingredients at that) to create masterpieces of texture and flavor.  Not JUST art.   But also science.",

We just happened to be there just in time for their happy hour offerings. 3pm-6pm daily 10pm- closing  - $2 off wines, draft beers and cocktails. - $4 well - $4 32oz PBR  PIZZA ROCK MEATBALLS ($4 for 3 balls during HH, $1.50 for each additional meatball): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2hDLZd1&s=14020fbbf0f14de76b87f9e1c1b28e73f3864edea1bd6c670a89feaa16cc5881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2hDLZd1</a> Believe the hype folks, these tender meatballs were absolutely delicious!!  Meaty, tender and no bready fillers. It comes smothered in this kick-ass marinara that our table couldn't get enough of. We kept dipping our fries, pizza crusts, calamari - everything we could use to get every last drop of that sauce. I'd return just for these babies.  COCCOLI ($12): Served with burrata and prosciutto. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2izk0rG&s=5bd10213abb367e7e40a2266d936845e65fe1f30767b1b49cb1feda2297e2790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2izk0rG</a> These addicting sea-salted fried dough arrived hot and oh-so-fluffy! Savory with a subtle sweet finish.  - The melt-in-your mouth burrata starts to melt immediately as it touches the bread.  - Throw in a generous pile of delicious prosciutto to elicit even more oohs & ahhs from our table. The perfect indulgence and great start to our meal.  .   CALAMARI FRITTI ($12): We got both the regular and the spicy calamari. Served with a marinara and spicy aioli dipping sauce.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iOTdej&s=77075d83af982569b489904e75ba83e01344304dea17ebba6b4fdc06647bfbec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iOTdej</a> - Fantastic crunchy batter that doesn't fall apart when you eat it. - LOVE the delicious marinara! - The calamari was really tender but the over-salting on the spicy calamari was hard to look past.  GARLIC ROSEMARY FRIES ($4 happy hour price): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2hyhlwP&s=94aa116e9e26877da54d51094c29a4b0e42e8bdd7dcb5ac1d29d5d0a69ca875c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2hyhlwP</a> Cooked just right (crispy on the outside and soft in the inside) and chock full of yummy fried garlic, what's not to like?   CAL ITALIA ($7 happy hour price for personal pan size): Topped with asiago, gorgonzola, mozzarella, fig preserve jam, prosciutto & balsamic reduction drizzle.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2irjTS5&s=c5fea70efce4a004a57c13bfbed9a7b92a19f4f399f24e1118f5611a747bf51e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2irjTS5</a> The dough was very similar to our appetizer but with a nice char. I got it without the jam because I'm not a fan of sweets and it seemed like overkill when there's already a balsamic glaze as well. - Wish there were more toppings on there, especially the prosciutto. My lil guy was a bit naked...  Definitely will return for the Coccoli and meatballs!",

TIP - After your carb loaded dinner, lock the leftovers in the parked car, and take a nice long walk in the Fremont St Experience... The people watching is a hoot.   TIP2 - download the parking app to your phone and get regular [time expandable] updates as to your car's parking status.  #getyourcarbson !!",

The crust of the pizza was nice but besides that it was just middle of the pack pizza. Yes I am from New York (Nu Yauk), and that makes me a tough critic. But I was really underwhelmed after all the recommendations I received from Locals (mostly cab drivers).   Its also $4 a slice. Which honestly is a tough bite to swallow compared to what they sell in NYC for $1-$2.",

We made a reservation in advance and were seated right away. Casual vibe, great music, and surprisingly quick service even though the place is big and was packed on this Friday night. The server was awesome, even offered to split our check. Here's what we ordered: - Although beer and wine would probably have been a safer bet, my negroni was pretty good. - The coccoli fried dough was warm and delicious (if not healthy) served with a generous cup full of burrata and surprisingly tender prosciutto.  - I didn't like the wood-fired asparagus as much. The veggies were fine, but the quail egg on top was small and over cooked. Maybe quail eggs are a fancier ingredient, but it didn't provide the runny, yolky goodness that I wanted.  - The family-size house salad was great for sharing, plenty of crisp greens and a good dressing on the side.  - B and I split the Artichoke Joe pizza- mozzarella, artichokes, spinach, garlic, parmigiano cream, provolone, pepper, and the secret ingredient.... LEMON! It was so delicious I didn't want it to end. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to put lemon on a pizza, but brilliant move!   Good place to go for an inexpensive dinner on a night of cocktailing in the downtown area.",

    "text": "So on a last-minute diversion from HQ, our company decided to have a director's meeting here in Vegas.  What that meant to my schedule today was a hectic morning, shuffling and pricing flights to get to Vegas, end result putting me back $507. It also meant that I didn't have time to grab a bite to eat and I arrived at about 3:35 PM good and hungry.  How lucky was I to find that Pizza Rock was just across the street from the Grand Hotel where I'm staying downtown?  I had eaten at Pizza Rock a few months ago when my company had a national sales meeting here and was really impressed with the pizza so it was a no-brainer making that trek across the street after I arrived.  I went with the \"vegetarian\" pizza which is essentially a margarita pizza with cherry tomatoes instead of tomato slices. All the ingredients are fresh and wonderful, which makes for a very tasty pizza. There are three things that truly define the pizza. Firstly, the dough and how well it's baked. Well, at PR, it's fire roasted here to perfection.  Secondly, it's the cheese. If a restaurant uses low-quality cheese there's just something about how it tastes and how it melts that's not correct, and that is not the case at this restaurant as it's chewy and delicious. And lastly and most importantly, it's the Marinera.  An unsavory and bland Marinera can absolutely ruin the pizza no matter how good the dough or cheese is.  Pizza Rock's Marinera is zinging, spicy, and just right.  Add to that a 500 ML bottle of Mexican Coke and you have the best first meal to have when arriving in Vegas.  I will definitely be back before I leave!",

Slices weren't badly priced, $4 for a slice of cheese, $4.50 for a slice of pepperoni. We ordered then sat in the darkly lit restaurant portion, with interesting music videos playing on the TV's. Server was great, and fast, but they ran out of Coke for my friend and the Belgian White Ale I originally ordered. That's not good.   Pizza is pretty good though, thin crust and very well done. Will have to go back and try some of their specialty pizzas or something off the menu. Table next to us was chowing down on some Calzones that looked good.",

    "text": "Another great addition to downtown. Sorry to all the other pizza joints but this place is Legit!! After reading the new opening section I wanted to Pizza Rock that happens to serve my favorite food(Pizza ; )   We started out with a Caesars Salad. It was a decent size that three of us shared as an app. Nice crunchy croutons and shave fresh Parmigiano Reggiano on top. The server offered fresh pepper as he delivered the food.   The Margherita- this was brought out first. The San Marzanos tomatoes make this pizza so tasty. The dough is soft and and cooked in perfectly. Defiantly reminds me of Italy!  Classic Italian style- decided on the Prosciutto and Pomodorini. This was my favorite of the two. The fresh arugula and the cherry tomatoes adding some acidity. Also this dough had more of a crisp to it. amazing!   Service was excellent. We had plenty of questions and our serve helped along the way. Some many more different styles of pizza to try and the other items on the menu as well. I will be back this week",

I ordered the calabrese calamari to start which had amazing spicy flavor and not too much breading. They have so many different types of pizza crusts to choose from but we chose he cracker thin. It was perfect! The cracker thin Old Chicago pizza was delicious and savory 5/5. Between the sausage and ricotta, it was hard to stop eating. Next time I am in the area I will definitely stop there again.",

I have no idea if the pizza is that good or not because we didn't get to eat it. We had a table in the bar area. A 20 minute wait just to order beverages and we took the queue and ordered food at the same time. After the drinks arrived it was another 20 minutes for two sliders to come out. The two personal pizzas we ordered took more than 30 minutes.  Our zipeline ride was at midnight and we had to ask for the check when the pizza came out because we ran out of time.  Just really really slow service.",

    "text": "We left the Reggae Festival at the Amphitheater after 11 pm, so I checked Yelp to see what restaurants were open.  I was shocked to find that so many downtown joints close at 10.  On a Saturday night in summer??  Pizza Rock was open, and since I hadn't been at the Yelp Elite shindigs held there, it was definitely on my bucket list.    The front of the restaurant looked like the kind you'd find on any street corner in NYC, so I was surprised by the size of the dining room in back.  Dark. Loud.  Dark's not a bad thing, but loud's another story.  I liked a lot of the music they being played (live DJ), but not the songs that were so thunderous that they reverberated through my body as if I were being tased.  We were there at Happy Hour time, so we took advantage of that.  We shared a house salad (not on the HH menu) and a Frank's True Italian personal pizza.  Hubby ordered the meatballs; we didn't share those because I'm not a fan of balls when they're the traditional beef, pork and veal combo.  I know they're supposed to be the best, but it's just not my thing.  The sauce, though, was divine, and there was enough of it to make a meal.  It may well be the best sauce I've ever tasted.  He loved the whole thing so much he ordered a foursome for $4 to take home.  And I put some of that sauce on my pizza, which doesn't come with the red stuff.  So why, almost alone among Yelp Elites, do I give this only three stars?  After all, the table was comfortable, the service was terrific, the Yogi Berra quote stenciled on the wall was hysterical, and the HH prices reasonable.  Aside from the blasting music, this is, after all, a pizza joint, one that's revered by many.  And the answer is:  I DIDN'T LIKE THE PIZZA!!!  As born and bred New Yorkers, we know that no matter how good the toppings, pizza needs a crispy crust.  This was soft, and weird, almost like the boxed stuff in the supermarket frozen aisle.  I took home the couple of leftover slices, hoping they'd crisp up in the toaster oven, but they didn't.    I wanted and expected to love Pizza Rock, but in my book it was only okay.",

They have take out, counter seating right in front of the over, or dine in with a much larger menu. They would even gladly let you take your slice and eat it in the dining room. Outdoor seating as well, if you want to enjoy the ambient music blasting from Fremont street. Everything is prepared in front of you so you know what you are getting. Price is a tiny expensive but being close to downtown, I guess it's expected, Make sure to grab extra napkins to absorb the excessive oil though...",

There is a pizza here for everyone and it will be the best one you've ever had!

My brother ordered a salad without croutons, (croutons in salad); asked for a glass with my beer (different server, no glass), and ordered the Mostaccioli with the marinara sauce, only.  We mentioned that we cannot have cream sauce since we have disgestion issues.  When this dish arrived, it came with melted cheese on top, along with a spicy cream sauce.  In essence, JJ did not hear a word we said in our initial order and acted like he couldn't be bothered.  We had to flagged him down for any of our needs.  We were very disappointed with him.",

I remember a few friends talking about Pizza Rock and on my wandering I came upon Pizza Rock so I decided to take a look.  I went up to the take out counter and like another review said the man behind the counter listed off all the types of pizza's and their ingredients.  Well, not being a brave soul I got the Pepperoni only slice, it was HUGE.  I added a dash of hot peppers and parmesan cheese (Only $4.05 with tax!!!)and started to walk back to work, but the smell got me and I had to take a bite.  Oh my it was good, the wood fire stove taste was there and the sauce was rich and the cheese gooey and I was sold.  Because the slice was so big I did something else I never do, I saved the rest for the next days lunch.  I put it in the toaster oven for a couple of minutes and yep! as good as it was yesterday.   I am so happy I started working downtown just for Pizza Rocks!  I plan on having my meet-up group meet there for lunch one day soon!",

We started with calamari that was both traditional and spicy along with fried artichokes and meatballs...fabulous.  Then the pizza... all I can say is -  OMG - they know how to make pizza - the choices ranged from traditional to \"you have got to be kidding me!!\"  Under the recommendation of others dining, we were encouraged to try the Mud Pie for dessert.... which we all agreed was the best dessert ever.

    "text": "Went here on Saturday night and my expectations were way too high.  After winning Best of Las Vegas and hearing such great reviews, I was ready for some great pizza.  Server wasn't polite nor was even present for the majority of the meal, she seemed too busy and flustered by the large group of 15+ in the table next to me.  I can get past bad service as long as the food is good but the pizza was just okay.  I had the New Yorker New Haven style (really excited to see New Haven style) and my GF had the Margherita GF.  The pizza was okay, the toppings were okay and just being friendly.  The star of the pizza was truly the sauce.  My GF said he GF pizza was okay but nothing special.  I have yet to hear her fall in love with any pizza places GF crust so that's understandable.  But betweeen my one beer, her house salad, my 3 meatballs appetizer and the two pizzas, $70.00!  Are you kidding me?  Pizza for $70 for two?  Wasn't blown away by any means, deserves $$$$ for pizza prices.  Cool idea with every kind of oven, but just meh, don't see what the hype is about seeing as other places in town do better pizza for a fraction of the cost (and no I'm not talking about dominos, pizza hut, papa johns)",

Next time your in the neighborhood pop in to the walk-up window and Augi will treat you right. Some people like to dab the grease off the pizza, don't do it!  Those mini bite sized pepperoni's are like little shots of flavor!",

    "text": "I knew I would be craving pizza while in Vegas so stopped in Pizza Rock (after doing my research pre-trip) on a Saturday afternoon. The menu is large and something for everyone. My girlfriend and I agreed on the St. Anthony which consisted of Mozzarella, House Made Fennel Sausage, Italian Sausage, Garlic, Roasted Red Peppers, Ricotta, Basil, Hot Red Pepper Oil, with 2 Cage Free Eggs.   The pizza only took about 15 minutes. It was delicious. Im not a fan of thinner crust but it truly was delicious in every way. The crust has a perfect chew, was cooked perfectly, and toppings fresh, not out of a box. Toppings were plentiful, not sparse. We killed the pizza and were eventually full. Would have loved to try dessert but no chance of that. $20 was a very fair price considering some places want to charge $5 for a crappy cheese slice so thin I can write a note on it. Service was also A+. Atmosphere cool....looked like a fun place to watch a game.   Will definitely return on my next trip to downtown LV.",

They are located right across the street from The Grand Hotel & Casino. They validate parking for The Grand parking structure, so you don't pay a dime, no matter how long you stay!  We ordered 'The New Yorker' which is a 16\" pie with pepperoni, sliced meatballs, and mozzarella swirls. The pie took about 20 minutes to come out. After receiving the pie, we started to dig in and I saw that they were very generous with all the toppings. The mozzarella swirls tasted quite interesting, somewhat sweet and very creamy unlike any mozzarella I have ever had. I thought that the pepperoni were too oily and crunchy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. Overall, the pie was tasty, but I thought that it was too pricey for a small pie. For a 16\" pie, it was $23, but with tax and tip, it came out to $30.   I would try it out, but if I came back, I would definitely try something else!",

If you're interested in a traditional Margherita, this is a great pizza. I thought the flavor was good but the center was a little limp and soggy.   While the Margherita was good, what stole my heart was the quail egg pizza.  It was perfectly crispy and delicious. It was just all around unique and had a great flavor profile.  Last note:  Mob special - The Boss Pizza + 2 tickets to the Mob Museum = $36. Tickets to the Mob Museum for two are about this price. This is a great deal if you're planning to check out the Mob Museum. It's definitely worth a trip.",

Chorizo mussels served in a spicy tomato sauce over thick chunks of toasted bread.  Battered & fried (not greasy!) large whole artichokes served with a slightly spice aioli (nice size for the price and were slightly addicting).  And this was just the beginning (Go ahead, read it again with a smile).  Six hungry, hedonistic gastronomes with an expectation of sumptuous, savory sustenance drawn from a not-so-long-ago memory of amazing pizza in San Francisco.  Tony's Pizza Napoletano.  Will Tony's pizza be just as good here as it was in San Francisco? Will the hot (ok, not so hot in November), dry Mojave desert climate affect the chewy goodness of Tony's pizza crusts?  Will two pizza's suffice?  Perhaps we should opt for three?  Perhaps order two and add a third later?  Our friendly server, Autumn, suggested placing our order all together due to several large parties.  Thank you, Autumn!  Here goes: Clam and garlic - OMG.  Best damn clam pizza we've had.  Perfect Goldilock-sized pieces of clam with garlic generously enveloping every bite.  Diavola - Like spicy?  We like spicy.  And we really like Diavola!  A spicy pie served with generous chunks of sopressata, mozzarella, and arugala.  And oh yes, a spicy tomato sauce.  I loved that the arugala was ever so slightly wilted, providing a slight pepperiness without being overly bitter.  Qual Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale - Guanciale is one of our favorite Italian pork products.  The rich flavor of the buttery guanciale paired beautifully with the delicate flavors of the potato, quail egg, and mozzarella.  Very nicely done!  After consuming all but a small slice of the clam & garlic and looking at it sadly, then glancing around the table, we realized we were satisfyingly satisfied.  And then Autumn brought the dessert menu.  Mind you, we were stuffed.  Truly.  I just kept thinking how perhaps a bit of gelato would... I don't know, do... something.  So, since we started a coconut trend earlier in the evening I delightedly selected some coconut sorbet.  My sister chose the Pecan Turnover - a puff pastry brimming with a sweet maple-pecan crunch and a generous serving of ice cream on top.  The coconut sorbet was a very generous serving of refreshing coconut, and I feel badly and a little sad that I wasted so much.  Are you a local?  Do you love pizza?  Do you like hanging downtown?  Me too!  And guess what?!  Locals receive a discount.  Oh yes.  Keep me coming back, baby.  And... they have take out.  I sense Mastunicola in my future (by the way, Google translator is great for learning how to correctly pronounce Italian pizza names).  Welcome to Vegas, Tony and crew!  We are so glad you came.",

    "text": "My new favorite pizza restaurant.  The menu is amazing; different pizzas and crusts, prepared in different ovens at different temperatures with different cooking fuels.  And the pizzas themselves and the toppings.  The bar has a great selection of draft beers too.  I've read what some others have said about \"burned\" pizza; but they explain that it's a cooking technique.  TRUST ME, TRY IT and you'll enjoy it.  It's one of their signature pizzas and they flash cook them in an oven for just about 5 minutes.  It was great!  After going in December, we back in February for the \"Kids in the Kitchen\" program held every Saturday.  It fills up fast, so you need to call early.  It was a great morning.  We got to tour the kitchen, throw dough up in the air (yes, they let the parents play along too!) and then we got to make our own pizzas under the guidance of one of the cooks.  Then they cook it and you get to enjoy your creation!  They also let us sample a few other treats on the menu.  There's a pizza with honey, sweet onions and other sweet toppings (it's NOT a dessert pizza though).  I never would have ordered it, but when they offered me a slice I tried it.  It was great!  The whole place is fun and you'll have a difficult time even picking out your pizza.  Just be prepared that the music is a bit loud; but what do you expect given the name.  Looking forward to my next meal at Pizza Rock!",

    "text": "So its time to update my last review for Pizza Rock.  I must say once I posted my last Yelp review  the owner, Trevor responded to me immediately-within hours of the post.  He was entirely all over the issue, asking for details and assured me that all issues would be addressed which is all that I had hoped for.    My second visit was quite the opposite of my last experience and I was anticipating some kind of issues.  First off,  it was New Years Eve and second we had a reservation for a party of 12.  We started out with 10 people and added 2 more the day before with no problem.  When we arrived a few of us went to the bar to order a drink anticipating  to wait a little bit before being seated.  The bartender (I didn't get his name) was more than helpful and a very cool guy with Corona shaped New Years glasses. ;)   Amazingly we were seated within 5 minutes as the other people around us were looking at over an hour wait-because they didn't have reservations.  I highly recommend the reservations-especially on a major holiday.  Immediately we were greeted by our server Anisa with a smile and excitement that we were there and she was ready to help us in any way possible.  I must say I was greatly surprised at the service we received with all the factors I mentioned above.  Anisa was both personable and attentive that we hardly realized that she was serving other several tables.  A simple thing that makes you a super server-unfortunately not everyone can have that talent.   Drinks were flowing and we all ordered with 3 or 4 split checks without any issues.  For 5 of us we ordered the New Yorker and the Cal Italia pizzas.  The New Yorker is the most amazing pizza I have ever had...that is what we ordered the last time so you know it has to be good.  It is topped with sausage and little pepperonis....but my favorite part was the super creamy ricotta strategically placed on top where you could spread it around with your fork to savor a little on every bite.  Yum.  The Cal Italia had prosciutto and a balsalmic drizzle  that had a flavor like none other.  Seriously between the two pizzas we were 100% satisfied and all was gone except for one slice in the end.  Not too bad for 5 people.  Others ordered spaghetti and meatballs (it was gigantic), lasagna (which my man said he may have to order next time-it looked fabulous), the Romana  II (which gives you a little variety and its big enough to share).  Everyone was very happy with their food and we left full and tipsy. =)  Now we did have a small incident where one of my guests spilled a whole glass of ice water all over me.  It could have been worse right??   Anisa, even though it wasn't their fault, comp'ed us a pizza just for the inconvenience which was definitely not expected by any means.  We definitely were pleased with  our server so much that we will ask for her the next time we visit.  All I can say is FINALLY some good quality food downtown.  We've been waiting a long time for some good eats out there.  You can bet that's where we will be eating while we are down there.  Thank you Trevor, for listening to my concerns and working out the kinks.  I believe an honorable owner is one that listens to the customer and strives to correct the issues no matter how big or small they may be.  And thanks to Anisa for making our New Years Eve dinner a special one to remember.  Happy New Year Pizza Rock - my New Years resolution is to see you often in 2014.  Cheers!",

A surprisingly large space, literally big enough to park a truck, it was an early arrival that assured us use of the large private dining room and with excellent service from both the general manager plus an enthusiastic young waiter it would not be long before our pizzas started to arrive and brought out in three separate courses it was with the signatures that we began, the \"limited\" Margherita proving cool to the touch and shockingly bland despite both excellent char and chew to the crust while the Cal-Italia proved far superior with a crunchy, toothsome crust more than able to stand up to a bevy  of toppings both sweet and savory, acidic and creamy.  Moving next to the interesting yet overly complicated and entirely too spicy Quail Egg selection it was at last the \"3-course\" Romana with its cracker crisp crust and well-paired toppings that wowed me most - the central third particularly well done with the rich meatballs nicely balanced by light cream and ample garlic, though the sweet selection was certainly not lacking in contrast or flavor either.  Moving last to a gifted half of the Farmer's Market Pizza, unfortunately overloaded with cinnamon just as the Quail Egg had been with spice, and finally to a trio of desserts where only the delicate pecan turnover would prove either inspired or memorable I think it is safe to say that the key to enjoying a meal at Pizza Rock is to simply embrace the concept and realize that \"everything to everyone\" and \"do one thing and do it well\" are very different mantras; the former definitely improved by a group of good people, excellent service, and (at least in this case) fond memories of 80's and 90's rock ballads.",

The pizza itself had a good amount of toppings and the sauce was tasty. this is a thin crust style...so Chicago style afficiandos don't show up and bitch ;-)  Service was average  ..with an engaging bartender it could have been 4 stars...not an indictment of bad service, just nothing that set it apart.

Then boy, do I have a place for you!! So, maybe that was a loaded intro, but I'll make up for it by keeping this short and sweet.   We ordered the 6 meatballs, truffle fries, rosemary garlic fries, a margherita pizza and a Cal Italia pizza.   The meatballs had zero flavor to them and were mighty dry. The sauce was passable. Not only could I have made better meatballs, but that one Aunt everyone has who cooks terrible food and brings it during your family gatherings could have out shined these meatballs with her eyes closed.   The fries were an embarrassment. Like, think cheap bargain basement U.S. Foods quality fries with barely any flavor added to them. It's a pizzeria and they weren't too outrageous at $6, so I won't hold that one too much against them.   The pizza we ordered was the trendy napoletana style small undercooked pizza. It was ok. Not $16 ok, but ok. I should really have tried the New York style, but that will be saved for another time. Those are $20+ a piece. And should you want a Sicilian, they offer them here, but for $30+ for a rectangle. Apparently you can get away with charging these prices in Downtown Las Vegas. At somewhere like New York Pizza & Pasta, you pay $17 to start, and it fills the entire square of the 16\" pizza box. I didn't try the other pie as the toppings didn't do it for me.   The server was friendly. Though, a pet peeve of mine is when a pizzeria doesn't automatically bring out parmesan and red pepper. It should either be on the table right away or served with the pizza. That's pizza 101, guys. Thankfully, the drinks weren't too nuts. My Jack and Coke was like $7. They also offer a 20% discount for locals, so I suppose those two things ease the highway robbery a bit. There are TV's everywhere and the place is spacious. So, the highlight of my experience was that there were TVs and I wasn't crammed in around other people... It's downtown, where it's trendy to overpay for subpar items and deal with inconvenient parking. Not sure I'll return, unless I'm in the area and starving. If I do, I'll try a NY style and skip the meatballs and fries. You probably should too.",

Pizza Rock delivered, no reservations and on a Saturday night we were able to nestle around the bar (they had a table 20 minutes later but no need we found our sitting/standing situation made for an intimate yet fun atmosphere).  The noise level was perfect, great music playing but you could sing to a song but hear your pals.  Great cocktail menu and lots of different beers with attendees who look tough (I mean the place is called Pizza ROCK) with great customer service skills and able to keep up with our group and the bar.  The aps and pizzas were a treat!  we ordered a few aps and a few pizzas, all good!!!  I strongly recommend meeting up here with friends and start your night out!",

    "text": "I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.  On to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.  Other than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.  What we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \"Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\". I'm not sure what that means.  Overall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \"normal\" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.  Final decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.  Other things I want to go back for:  Their Margherita (only 73 made per day) Clam and Garlic Pizza La Regina (The Gold Cup Winner) Quail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza Cal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner) The Chorizo Mussels (App) And I would come back again for the meatballs.  Looks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now.",

The outside sign can't be missed and the interior is surprisingly larger than it looks from the outside.

This is located one block off of Fremont Street.  Next time I would like to dine in the regular restaurant and check out their beer selection.  The staff at the slice counter were friendly and seemed to know their regular guests.  That's a bonus! Highly recommend!",

I give it a 4 because it's not as good as NY pizza but it's great pizza for Vegas. Also - VEGANS - they have a pie for you!! The marinara pizza is the only \"vegan friendly\" item on the menu (besides salad) but it's really good! Definitely worth coming to.",

Simple lunch - the garlic garlic bread and a margherita pizza (as it won the pizza world cup!).  The garlic garlic bread actually had a decent amount of garlic! most people put a bit on but pizza rock added enough that you could actually taste it!! great stuff.  The pizza. Well - its a big claim to have won the pizza world cup and try to maintain that standard but its one they live up to. It was excellent and my kids declared it the best pizza he's tasted. My only difficulty would be either to order that in future or try something different. Its that good.  Tried to return a couple of nights later only to find a private party had booked the whole dining room. How dare other people find it so good that they book the whole place out!! :D try it - you'll love it. I'll be back.",

We never had the patience to wait in line for Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. But I found out Tony Gemignani opened this place in Las Vegas...what an opportunity!  We came here around 3pm midweek...the place was empty. The bartender served us...he was very friendly and efficient when the place started filling up later.  We started with the gorgonzola and apple salad...this was probably the tastiest thing we had. It was a tasty mix of greens, gorgonzola, apples, candied walnuts, dried cherries and an overly sweet \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. In a recurring theme, it was a bit pricey at $13. The kiddo had the classic cheese pizza, while we had their \"World Pizza Cup Winner\"  Margherita Pizza Napoletana at $17 for a 12-incher. This pizza was pretty good, but definitely not the best I ever had. It was...pleasant...but so was the regular cheese pizza. In the ingredients list, they list Fior di Latte mozzarella...in other words, regular cow's milk mozzarella, like 99% of all pizzas in this country! This is what disappointed me the most...at this price, they didn't use mozarella di bufala...this would have made a HUGE difference in taste...as it was, the cheese was rather bland and tasteless.   So the food was ok...but very pricey. If you are in the neighborhood, by all means stop by if there is no line. I wouldn't make a special trip or wait for this food however.",

I think part of his segment was him selling fake practice dough to practice pizza twirling. Not sure if it's that guy and not willing to look it up. However, it did shape my opinion for some reason. Maybe they overhype things on food network and maybe this guy and his restaurant are all hype? WRONG!!! (At least in this case) This pizza is so good! I got the New Yorker and despite taking it to go with a 30 minute drive back to my house, it was still phenomenal. The crust had a crunchy char on the bottom (that might not be to everyone's liking) and there's a nice chewiness to it. It' wasn't tough or dry, but just a nice bite to it like really good bread. The toppings didn't take anything away from the crust either. There were these nice dollops of creamy ricotta that I really enjoyed. Everything about the pie worked for me. I'll definitely go back!",

Ordered the Fratellanza pizza which was a huge dismal glob of bread that was burned around the edges, doughy in the middle. Ironically everything else on the pizza was cold.  Stone cold.  I had a teenager with me and he wouldn't even eat it.  The waitress sent the manager over and he offered to fix another, but by that time everyone was pretty much just ready to leave.  It was hard to get a drink refill and we had to ask for a salt shaker for our appetizers because, as we were informed,  they don't put salt shakers on the tables.   Dismal dining experience.    The manager did take half the price of the pizza off the check.  Most of it was left on the table anyway.  We left to find lunch elsewhere.",

Loved it  Continuing on with the review, its Sunday night about 9-930 and it was pretty crowded when we walked in. We just wanted a slice and to hopefully jar some memories for Monica. The guy behind the counter, Auggie, was kicking some butt and the line was moving fast. He was taking the orders and food was being served like a well-oiled machine!!  Monica ordered a slice of pepperoni and i got a slice of the picante with a soda. We sat at the bar to enjoy our pizza. The pizza was grub!! Not burnt or greasy, just delicious!!  As we enjoyed our chow, we couldn't help but notice how Auggie was handling the orders, crowd and always remained courteous and professional. Please and thank you were words often heard said by Auggie. He also made sure our sodas were never empty.   Now days, customer service is lacking in so many businesses. It would be so easy to expect a pizza joint to have a guy behind the counter that doesn't give a damn about much other than his paycheck. Auggie is the absolute 180!   The Damn Good Pizza and Auggie makes it easy to give this place 5 Stars.",

Perfect deep dish crust with buttery crispness.  Authentic brick cheese and perfect sauce on top.  I added fennel sausage and wow the flavor was amazing.  The pizza is cut in four slices and are huge.  This way everyone has a corner piece. The service was quick and our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.  Loved their Fitzgerald martini made with gin and amaretto with a cherry at the bottom.  Very happy to find a pizza place that makes the perfect Detroit style pizza.

Staff was very friendly (Thanks Ty!, and the manager that shared some free beer samples) and made the whole experience fun.  They had a happy hour going (who knew?) so the beer was a little cheaper, and some good food specials.  We didn't really feel like pizza, so we opted for the gorgonzola fries, and WOW, were they ever good!  Creamy, hot, cooked just right.  Not over seasoned or sauced.  A great late night treat!  Saw the meatball special and the couple that had them said they were wonderful as well.  Good beer and liquor selection, and, oh, did I mention they have a Peterbilt in the middle of the place as their DJ booth?  Well, they do... And it's awesome.

But, the most part I was sold to this place was their New Yorker Pizza....it is so delicious. Mind you, I really don't like pizza with so many sauce on top of it because I can't handle it but this one was really different. I did enjoyed my slice and I totally forgot the taste of the sauce. Also, this place is a great place to bring all my friends and relatives from Out Of State to dine in. Pizza was expensive $33 for 16 inches but it's okay for I am so loving this place.",

I would return to this place based on that alone. The small pepperonis that have the reddish-yellow grease running are awesome. If you're from the east, it's known as Margarita pepperoni...at least where I'm from. Toppings were ample and the crust was tasty too!  Now for the down side. We returned to this place for a take-out pizza after walking around the area to see all the new businesses and a new casino. We ordered from the convenient walk-up window directly on 3rd St. Fantastic for passer-byes to grab a quick slice. So I ordered and paid. They said it would be 7 minutes. OK. Twenty minutes later, we went inside. They \"forgot\" to make our pizza. They offered me a \"free\" pepperoni pizza that was ready. How would this be free? I had already paid more for additional toppings. I said no, thank you. I'd like a fresh one. They offered a slice of pizza and a drink while I waited. I accepted that. All-in-all, we waited 45 minuted for a regular pizza order. I was on the verge of asking for my money back and leaving just as the pizza came out.   We did have a drink at the bar. Quite a fun bar, and the service was great here. Personable bartenders and reasonable prices. Worth stopping in if you're looking for a refresher!  Overall, the pizza quality and taste was excellent. Unfortunately, due to the incident I encountered, I feel I can only give a 3-star rating. If you go, you're sure to enjoy great pizza...just don't be in a rush. That won't happen.",

    "text": "I went to Pizza Rock on a Saturday night, mainly wanting to try it after hearing about the award winning pizza. Before going, I personally thought \"Rock\" as a theme for a pizza restaurant marketing world cup pizzas was strange. I suppose one gets used to the typical pizza place filled with brick veneer and recreated vintage signs. Pizza Rock is certainly a representation of the owners personal taste. It is poorly laid out, however. You enter into a relatively dark entrance, that is juxtaposed to an overly bright take-out bar to your right. The host's stand behind wood topped tool chests with iPads hanging from them. You would not know the they were employees if they weren't behind the chests. Guest waited against the walls on chairs. It was loud, like a sports bar, with the roar of the Patriots Colts game.   We were told it would be a 20 minute wait, they took my phone number so they could text me when our table was ready. I thought this was a cool feature, even more cool, our wait may have only been about 5 minutes.   They sat me and my girlfriend at a table for two, it was in a very unappealing space. It kind of felt floating in space, right by the busy restroom hallway, kitchen door, and main path of travel for customers to their tables. Back to how it is poorly laid out, the restaurant is overly long and narrow. I did not walk the entire thing, but the seating felt unorganized with out clear paths of movement that are not distracting to guests. Many times during the meal did new parties moving to their tables walk on all sides of our small for-two table, making us feel consciously swarmed for a brief moment.   Enough about the place, now to the meal and service. We sat down and immediately started reading the menu, their are many many options of unique pizzas complete with the temperature they cook it ATM the prices seemed fair. Our Caesar salad may have been a little overpriced though at $10 - but it was plenty to share.   We were not immediately greeted by a server to take a drink order, probably about 5 minutes passed before we got concerned and happened to make eye contact with someone we thought might work there. Again, not dressed in any uniform or some sort, we simply notice he was talking briefly to our hostess. He asked us if we had been seen and then quickly got our drink order and server.   The server was nice and adequate, he did wear a uniform, but the service was nothing exceptional, about the standard you expect in such an establishment. I will say the food did come quick after ordering it however, and the 10% locals discount is appreciated.   We ordered a Caesar salad to share and the fried green beans appetizer. The Caesar was good, but the dressing was a bit cashier than I prefer. The fried green beans were disappointing because they were not actually fried. I was looking forward to something crunchy, maybe a bit salty but they are actually sauteed I believe. They were still good, just not what we were lead to believe.   OK, the pizza. We ordered the \"Cal Italia\" (I believe it was called) it was one of the award winning pizzas. It came fast and was delicious. The crust was airy and flaky and the fig sauce drizzled on top gave a perfect sweetness to each bite. The pizza was the perfect size to share for two after an appetizer, at about 6 medium sized slices. However, once again slightly mislead. This was a sauceless pizza, although I am pretty sure the menu said \"Vine ripe tomatoes sauce\".. maybe this one was a exception for the category it was under and I overlooked this detail.   I give this place 3 out of 5 stars for the whole package. The facility lacking basic design logic to make the experience comfortable and inviting. This isn't a critique on the decor and theme, but the basic layout. The service was pretty standard, I think I expect a bit more from these boutique restaurants, maybe it was an off night. I'd rate the food 4 out of 5, and would like to try more items on their menu, but I'll be in no hurry to go back.   I say try it when taking a night out Downtown or if visiting Vegas. Its a casual place to bring a group of friends or family, watch the game, and get some pizza.",

The beer selection is always stellar and the bartenders have no problem letting you try some new beer before you purchase one.  I like the fact that you can purchase a slice and sit at the bar and get a beer.  It reminds me of being home again .  The only reason why i gave 4 stars is because the pepperoni pizza gets greasy other than that a plus!!!!",

The guy spins pizza dough out on the floor and plays with the crowed. The food is exceptional. It has an upbeat vibe with good ol fresh home cooked food. I am in LOVE!",
