    "text": "staying here at the renaissance, so we decided to have the brunch here at ENVY...  being an platinum elite member, i've been around a lot of different marriott properties, and have eaten at a lot of their on-campus restaurants. this is average at best, and service was it's down fall.  i had the buffet, the food as above average, aside from the lamb from the carving station was very tough, and served without mint jelly. the oysters were watery, the crab legs was salty. but the eggs benedict was surprisingly well done for a buffet and the omelet station had a wide range of ingredients and was very fast and efficient, which is rare for a sunday at 11am. my girlfriend (who is running the rock n roll marathon this afternoon), decided not to the buffet, and ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomato soup instead. the soup was a little cup of earthy goodness, while the grilled cheese was uninspiring. the bread was average, the cheeses was bland, and not completely melted through. it was bland. she only ate half of it...  the service was slow and inattentive. after we sat down, and notifying the server that my girlfriend didn't want the brunch, would rather order from the menu, i was already to the buffet once and back before he came back to take the order. water was not refilled regularly, my mimosa was not refilled at all. we had to ask the floor manager for the check because our server was no where to be found... the unavailable service was not limited to our server, the busing of the used plates was slow (and mind you, it was a brunch buffet), and there was a period of time no one was manning the carving station, instead he was back and forth bringing food out from the kitchen.  all in all? not an envious dining experience. especially for a renaissance (a supposedly boutique brand of the marriott brand).... so if you are reading this, i envy you for not have yet eaten at this place. go else where and thank me later.",

I had read on Yelp! about the truffle fries. and decided to give them a try as an appetizer.  They were fantastic, and truthfully, way too much for an appetizer for 4 people.  My aunt ant sister split a seafood platter for 2, and there wasn't a word from either one of them while they ate their food.  The shrimp on the platter were the biggest I have ever seen!  They must have been delicious, because neither of them offered to share.  My mom had the lamb, I think it was a rack of lamb, but can't be sure.  She loved it as well.  I had the filet mignon, which I had ordered medium rare, and came out medium well.  It was my fault for not saying anything, but I ate it anyway, and actually enjoyed it.  I would say. that despite being over cooked, it was so tender, and beautifully seasoned.  All the entrees came with family style mashed potatoes, and seasonal vegetables.  The mashed potatoes were not rememberable, however the roast vegetables were fantastic and interesting.  Mini squashes and beets, amoung other things were deliciously roasted together.   We had a fantastic waiter, Josh, I think.  He was funny. and attentive and knowledgeable.  He served my steak with a really neat trio of salts.  I have no idea why, but they were interesting. and terribly fancy pants.   I can't wait to take another trip to Vegas, and dine here again. I would cab it from the strip, however, it's a long scary walk!",

Staying at the renaissance hotel and craved steak but thought no way is the restaurant down stairs any good... well while my parents go to the grand cyn and leave me here alone, I say what the hey. Sooooooo goooodddddd!  Despite today being a sunday morning, where they only serve the brunch menu until 5, I let the hostess know that I had to get the rib eye steak and she had the chef prepare it for me. Perfect, now I can relax knowing my steak was on its way  weeee but because they didn't have the garlic mashed potatoes, I could either choose a side of grilled veggies or truffle fries... uhm did you say truffle fries?? Subconsciously I thought to myself that I should get the veggies, but somehow out of my mouth yelped the words TRUFFLE FRIES! Why must I be so weak? Started off with soup, they had their usual tomato soup or artichoke brie soup. Although I do love cheese, I thought I should choose the healthier option and I am so glad I got the tomato soup! The waittress asked about 3 times if I was done with the soup but I just couldn't give up the bowl until I scraped up every spoonful. The main attraction arrived, and I basically ate the whole rib eye and literally had to pry the plate of truffle fries away from myself. The steak was tender and juicyy while the fries were honestly the BEST fries I've ever tasted. I'm sorry to say that I really don't know how to explain the greatness of the fries, it's like  buttery but nutty and just soo flavorful. Guess you'll have to try it for yourself to experience the joy of truffle fries here at Envy! The waittress asked me how the food was and I said amazing as to which she replied everything here is amazing! Kudos to you, now I really do wanna try everything on the menu!  Super cute restaurant! They have live entertainment during the sunday brunch where he sings and plays the piano! He sings all the greatest classics and the waitresses are soooo cheery! Love love loveeeed this place, definitely going to come back here the next time i'm in vegas!! Can't wait to try the crab cakes!",

    "text": "ENVY is definitely one of the greats.  I was BLOWN away by the food here and I can't wait to come back.  I was staying at the Renaissance for one of my Vegas getaways and having a great deal hunter for a boyfriend, our stay included a $50 gift certificate for ENVY.    We started off with the crab cake which included bourbon corn & a red pepper sauce.  THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! One of the best crab cakes I've ever had & the red pepper sauce was soo good.  I made sure to finish all that sauce.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.  It was such a tease... I wanted more!!!  I took this as a great sign of what was to come...and the prophecy held True.  As our sides we had the garlic mashed potatoes, & ordered the truffle fries.  Both were AMAZING!!! They were delicious & I could eat these sides for the rest of my life...especially those fries!!!  The tower of fries was huge!!!  Honestly, you'll be glad you ordered these.  Our meal also included roasted veggies...this was forgettable to tell you the truth.. I didn't care for it & the only veggies that tasted good were the mushrooms.   On to the steak!! I ordered the bone-in rib eye & my boyfriend had the T-bone steak.  I believe we both ordered them medium rare.  OMG OMG OMG...the steak here was amazing!!!! Did I mention they were huge?!?!  I'm a big eater so I finished my entire rib-eye, I don't think many women will be able to finish it unless they push their limits & don't order an app. Anyway, both were cooked to perfection & the jus on top just made each bite a party in your mouth.  My taste buds were going crazy!!!  They ask you if you want any of their signature sauces to be included...I got the wild mushroom.  This was not necessary.  The sauce did nothing, if not take away the great taste of the steak.  What they also included were dipping salts.  There were 3 different salts, 2 from Hawaii & then 1 from some other place. lol.  This was a great addition to the steak.  Just putting 1 or 2 grains of salt on your slice of steak really elevated the flavor.  I couldn't get enough.  I really enjoyed my rib-eye up until the last bite & my boyfriend felt the same.   We didn't have any room for dessert.  Plus, I didn't want the taste of my rib-eye to go away.  I was actually really sad when I took my last bite because the whole experience took my breath away.   My boyfriend & I couldn't stop talking about that meal for the rest of the night.    You will NOT be disappointed by this place!! I hear they have coupons on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> so I would definitely take a look at that first because you come here.  And do yourself a favor, order the steak. Order what they do best & skip on the seafood.   This has got to be one of the best meals I've had in awhile.  I got much love for ENVY!",

My girl friend and me drove by this restaurant on our way to our hotel and we told each other to look it up on YELP to see if it had possibilities was rated high for 16 reviews, and it was close to our hotel so we decided to give it a go. The atmosphere was impressive, the service matched that of the atmosphere, and the food ---well this is where the turf meets the surf! ...   So why the two stars?? The wine selection. I asked the waiter for a selection of red wine to go with our meal (a pairing)...What we received was extremely disappointing, it just plain sucked! My girlfriend had ordered a fillet Mignon rare, and it came out almost well-done. They had reordered the steak for her and by the time it came out, my food was almost done and she was just beginning. The whole experience was a real disappointment overall and we will never consider coming back here again...there are just too many other fine dining establishments to choose from in Las Vegas to look back here a second time.  Two stars...one for the looks...one for the service...nothing for food or wine.  I think that that is the Meat of it! Bone-that's-petite!",

Don't get me wrong, it was good steak for the price, but for my visit this past weekend, it does not compare to the others (N9NE, Del Frisco's, Morton's, Maestro's), where I've walked out with the feeling of complete satisfaction.  The bone-in ribeye prepared medium rare was decent but not super juicy. The sea bass and their bleu cheese wedge salad were good, but as I've mentioned in my previous post, both at Kalani's are better. The mushrooms under my sea bass were overcooked, super shriveled, and some were almost dry! Their signature truffle fries were super tasty and crispy, but I'm not sure I tasted any of the truffle oil? If it was there, it was definitely overpowered by the parmesan and salt.  Conclusion: Call me crazy, but I've had better.",

Warning:  They do not accept all coupons.  Even though on the \"new\" certificates it clearly states that it excludes brunch the old certificates (that are valid for 1 year from date of purchase) do not have this exclusion.  When the waiter told us the news, the manager admitted that she knew this didn't have the exclusion but that the \"restaurant reserves the right not to accept the certificate\".  She was downright rude!  We have a $75 certificate for dinner and will absolutely NOT be using it ... and I would ask before you dine if they will accept the certificate as it wasn't said in words but implied that they reserve the same right for dinner.  So just some words of warning.  As for the waiter, he was great - very friendly and perfect service. As for the food, was good brunch for $29.95/pp.  Made-to-order omelettes, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, crab.  Pretty typical stuff, good quality but nothing that most buffets don't have.  Did include all-you-can-drink mimosa's, wine and bloody mary bar though.  Hate to give anywhere 1 star, but think its just bad business to not honor a certificate / coupon that you well know is in circulation.  Felt bad for the waiter who had to deliver this message, as its obviously someone in \"management's\" poor decision.",

The Living Social Deal we had was amazing, 40 for 80, however I paid 32.00 because there was an additional promo code.   My stomach only holds about 4oz so I can usually never finish anything I order.  I also don't eat beef so I was planning on ordering a couple appetizers, however, the 6oz lobster tail add on(to any steak) caught my eye.  My spouse got the 8oz filet with garlic butter and she just about licked her plate.  She said it was amazing.  Very tender( obviously) and cooked perfectly( medium well).  We shared the ceasar salad( no anchovy) and they split it between 2 plates.  The dressing was good, however, there was too much of it.  The delicate hearts of romaine were clearly overdressed.  Additionally, the crostini served with the salad was anything but crisp.    The rest of the meal was flawless, food and service.  We shared a humongous baked potato and I had a the mushroom sauce with my lobster.  The complimentary rolls are very good too.  They brought us a very rich chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Very sweet of them.   There was a slight communication error when we were brought Evian water and a huge bowl of mushrooms( as a side dish) instead of tap water and the mushroom sauce( complimentary), but that was quickly taken care of.   Total for 2 was 90, so I paid 10 extra plus 7.29 tax so total I paid was 49.29 plus tip.",

I made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and got 1000 points for it which I can cash in towards a dining certificate which meant I saved more money. ENVY is located in the Renaissance Hotel which is right next to the Las Vegas Convention Centre.  The Renaissance a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel which is amazing considering you can find slot machines literally everywhere from Laundromats to your local grocery store. There is valet parking for free and you may enter the restaurant either via the hotel lobby or by the separate street entrance located around the corner to your right from the main entrance of the hotel.  To me Envy has the look and feel of a classic steakhouse with muted lighting and solid furniture. The seats are upholstered and well padded and seating consists of tables or booths. The menu reflects the same: Steak and Seafood and what I always find on menus of steakhouses: Caesar Salad, French Onion Soup and some entrees for those who want something other than steak. We started with Espresso Skirt Steak and the Peppered Calamari & Rock Shrimp. The Espresso Skirt Steak was nice. The beef was melt in your mouth tender. The hint of espresso was a little too subtle, it tasted more of the wine used in the deglazing; I could barely tell that espresso was there. The Calamari & Rock Shrimp were cooked well, tender but the sauces were a great disappointment. They tasted like they came out of a jar; one tasted like concentrated ketchup with some salt and pepper added and the other was obviously a sweet chili Thai sauce that was also out of a bottle. The portions were extremely generous. I made the mistake of not having steak at a steakhouse. I had the Grand Seafood Plateau and my companion had the Balsamic Lamb Rack.  The Seafood Plateau looked magnificent and everything was fresh and well prepared but really it was just fresh seafood boiled and chilled. There were oysters, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, clams, and mussels. The clam and mussels were a little over done. The shrimp was huge jumbo shrimp and the best part of the plateau. The sauces again were terrible, the spicy cocktail sauce was the same sauce that came with the Calamari and Rock Shrimp, a mayonnaise, and there was another apple cider vinegar type sauce that really didn't add anything to the seafood so I opted to just use pepper and lemon juice. Regular price is $55, so I was glad I was using a discounted voucher. The lamb was cooked to perfection but lacked flavour. The sides were underwhelming. We had Grilled Asparagus with Dijon Glaze and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The portions again were huge and we could have done with just one side dish as both entrees had vegetables with them. The best was the garlic mashed potatoes. The asparagus and the glaze didn't go together and the Brussels sprouts were pretty basic.  For dessert we shared the Creme brulee. Presentation was nice with some berries on the side. It was good but again not the best Creme brulee I've had. It was ok. Our server was pleasant and helpful and even kept a running tab so that we knew how much we had left of the $140 at the end of our meal if we wanted to use it up. Overall it was a disappointing experience for the type of restaurant it was. The food was underwhelming and perhaps business has reflected that and the reason for the travelzoo voucher promotion. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the meal. It is not a place I would return to given the myriad of restaurants in Las Vegas.",

I enjoyed my food. They gave me a handwritten bday card.  I rarely eat in a fancy restaurant, but the food was cooked to perfection. My favorite side dish was the lobster Mac and cheese because of the visible chunks of lobster and creamy flavor.  The medium-steak was seared to perfection. 5 stars  Cons-no reasonable cons.  It is out of my usual price range, but I cannot expect a cheap meal at a high-class location.  5 stars",

    "text": "+Elegant dining environment perfect for medium to large professional groups +Pleasant and knowledgeable staff (server Deonte was superb) +French onion soup is highly recommended +Rosemary bread served with knobs of butter. Bread had nice crust.  If you are on the hunt for an off the strip eatery that is more like a dining experience Then, I, too highly recommend heading to The Envy, which is less than a block and a half from the Las Vegas Convention Center.   The interior design is a luscious and robust use of deep hues of red and burgundy that is appealing for a steakhouse. Per review of Elite Yelper's, I opted for the petite filet mignon. It's worth the price that it costs. I asked for medium rare, but upon initial receipt my steak was cooked medium well. I requested a new one to be fired up medium rare. This time. It was perfect. The chef elevated my experience by offering my table a side garlic mash potatoes and the shiitake mushrooms. I melted in my seat. The succulent petit filet forked over a bit of mash and mushrooms, then washed clean by a spicy Pinot Noir. It's melodic. Symphonic. This culinary tour was an orchestrated performance that is truly rustic and Americana.  The server was informative, apologetic and entertaining. He really ensured that I received a memorable experience.   A memorable culinary food experience in Las Vegas, overall.",

    "text": "Came here for a Groupon special ($40 for $80), and was thoroughly impressed. The hotel lobby is a bit off the Strip, but has just as much panache and grandeur of some more popular locations... And the Envy Steakhouse? It was fantastic.  Our party of two really pigged out: bone in rib eye, lobster macaroni, truffle fries, and calamari...  The appetizers were great price and easily shared for two, if not three people. At $7 a plate, they were a steal!   THE CALAMARI was uniquely crunchy but with perfectly cooked squid. The dipping sauces (sweet and cocktail) were a rich flavor that contrasted nicely with the lemon-sprinkled rings of calamari.  THE TRUFFLE FRIES and LOBSTER MACARONI were the usual restaurant expectations; the fries were a bit crispy since they were shoestring sized. The lobster Mac&cheese was a bit over seasoned with salt, and I would have preferred a spicier cheese to the mild mix they used. Regardless, both dishes were delicious at $7 a pop.  The BONE-IN RIBEYE was excellent. Perfectly medium rare (is there any other way?), salted along the bone and fatty sides, and a beautiful cut. Not the best rib eye in the world, but very impressive and delicious. Definitely worth a try at least once. It gives the \"steakhouse\" part of the name some credibility, since everything else we had ordered were appetizers. Comes with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The mashed potatoes were a tad salty on their own, but delicious with the steak.  Overall, a great experience with excellent service. With or without a Groupon, I would visit again.  PROTIP: complementary valet parking on site, and great for a nice quiet couples dinner.",

The restaurant is casual but classy. I love the wine cellar off to the side when you first come in. There's a pretty decent wine selection here.    We had:  -Envy salad: we shared this and they plated it separately for us. The portion was great even when sharing. The sweet herb vinaigrette was light and delicious.  -Complimentary bread in a variety of flavors. My favorite was garlic, and my husband raved about the black olive bread. Be careful, though, it's unlimited, but it's warm and fiercly addicting. Save room for dinner!  -8 oz. filet mignon. Cooked to perfection.  -Pan roasted chicken breast. I know, I know. How could you order something that's not steak at a steakhouse? Sometimes you just should, because otherwise you'd miss out on a gem of a main course like this one. The sauce on this was incredible. Such an enjoyable dish.  -Sides, including garlic mashed (mouth watering and perfectly garlicky), and bacon brussel sprouts (not a fan, but that's not because of anything Envy did to them), and my husband added on the cream corn, which he loved.  -Warm toffee sticky pudding. Heavenly. Not something I would have chosen for myself, but I was amazed by how decadent it was.   The absolute best part of this restaurant is the impeccable service. Waters were kept full at all times. Niki, our server, really enhanced the entire experience. She was so friendly and professional. She checked on us often without being intrusive. She gave us locals' buy one get one meal coupons good until September and applied one to our bill that evening. And we were given free toffee sticky pudding compliments of Envy for my birthday. This place is good, but the service makes it GREAT. Thank you, Niki, for creating a wonderfully memorable birthday meal! i will be back, and I'm so glad this I spent such a special evening here!",

It is served with roasted garlic & pine nut risotto which was also pretty good.  Pan-seared sea bass with truffle butter crust was nice and flaky and had a very subtle sweetness to it.  Other people seemed to love this dish as well.  Filet mignon was good too but I'm not a big steak person which is why I preferred their seafood items.  As many reviewers mentioned, the truffle-reggiano fries are a must try for appetizer.  They are perfectly thin and crispy with just the right amount of truffle flavor.  All their appetizers are huge and are meant to be shared with a party of at least two people.  It took three people to finish the fries and we were all stuffed.  We also ordered the Makers Mark bourbon creamed corn which was top notch.    They also had my favorite beer Delirium Tremens.    Our server was friendly and funny, and gave us some good recommendations, including how to enjoy their trio of salt on our bread.  By the way, their complimentary breads were pretty darn good.  They were super soft.  Place is located in the Renaissance Hotel near the Convention Center so is a pretty convenient place to dine if you are attending an event there.    Price is somewhat steep which is the reason I didn't give 5 stars.   This place is more like 4 dollar signs, not 3.  Most entrees were about $40-$60.  With a drink, appetizer, entree, and tip, it will come out to more like $80 per person.  I can get entrees at Hatfield's in LA for about $32-$40, and I think Hatfield's is a level higher than this place, but that's just my opinion.  Regardless, the food here is pretty good.",

After purchasing a Groupon for a six course menu for two, the business informed me they would not honor the deal, but that I could use the purchase price basically as a gift card towards my meal.   This business no longer honors the Groupon that they themselves sold and advertised. They specifically told me that they would not offer the 6 course meal for the Groupon, which is the only reason I purchased it.   Is this the way a business can treat costumers after advertising a Groupon? If I wanted a gift card, I just would have bought one. This is the most unprofessional, inconsiderate, and backwards policy that I have ever encountered. I will never patronize Envy Steakhouse and I hope they never, ever run a misleading and deceitful Groupon offer again.  It is False advertising to have someone but a Groupon and then not honor it. I am going to report them to Groupon and make sure that other customers DO NOT purchase a Groupon from this business.",

    "text": "Review for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:  I went to Envy tonight for the last night of Restaurant Week for this spring.  The choices were limited which is to be expected for a RW menu.  The bread basket was quite nice with slices of French bread, white chocolate walnut bread, and some breadsticks.   Course 1:  I opted for the Butternut Squash Soup with brown sugar croutons.  This was excellent!  When I took some soup with a crouton, I had both a somewhat sweet taste mixed with the flavor of the squash.  Truly inspired thinking on the part of the chef to come up with this combination.  Before Course 2, my server, Joshua, brought me a small triple dish that had sea salts from different parts of the world.  The white was from Australia, the black from Hawaii, and the pink was Murray River salt.  He urged me to try the salt but to use care because it can be overdone.  It was fun trying the different flavors with pieces of steak.  Australian was my favorite.  Course 2:  Of course I chose the filet mignon.  Why get salmon at a steak house?  The steak was anchored on some very thin slices of sweet potato.  The steak was cooked correctly.  I ordered it black and blue and it almost was.  Done a bit more than I like because it wasn't blue enough.  Course 3:  There was no choice here but who needed one?  RW dessert is triple chocolate lava cake.  It was outstanding.  The chocolate was rich.  It was also bittersweet chocolate which was a good choice to keep the overall sweetness in check.  There was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Great end to the meal.  A couple of things prevent me from giving a higher rating.  I'm not sure if the bread was warmed in a microwave but it seemed that way.  When I decided to have a second slice of that wonderful white chocolate walnut, it had dried quickly and had a bit of a crust on it.  This doesn't happen with fresh bread unless it's microwaved for heating.  As mentioned before, the steak was a little too done for me.  Finally, as another reviewer noted, you have to take into account the beautiful surroundings, the good service, and the portion size vis a vis the price and Envy comes up a bit short.  I realize this is an RW menu, but when comparing it to other places I went during Restaurant Week, Envy couldn't compare with some of the others.  The service was excellent.    Joshua, was very knowledgable and helpful.  Props to Chef Michael for stopping by the table to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal.    This was a good experience, but I'm not sure if I'd return.  I checked the regular menu and I'm sure my wife would be happier where her choices were more numerous.",

I came here for a friend's bachelor party. The restaurant is tucked away inside of the Renaissance Hotel - not a big Vegas name, but a nice place. It's never really crowded (we went prime hours on a sat and were fine) and has good service plus really good food.   I had the surf and turf special ... 8 ounce filet mignon and a lobster tale - SO GOOD! The meat was tender and thick, the lobster was perfectly cooked and mixed with butter and all sorts of goodness (it was like a baked potato, but in lobster form - can you even imagine). $55 for the plate - so worth it!  Anyway, the meals come a la carte, so make sure to order sides. The sides are to share and are decently sized. We had the spinach, the whiskey creamed corn (house special), the mashed potatoes and french fries.   The spinach and mashed potatoes weren't bad, but weren't mind blowing either. The fries are quite tasty and come in a massive pile!!! The whiskey creamed corn, however, is a must! You don't taste the whiskey much, but it gives it just enough sweetness.   Anyway ... overall good service, good food, good prices ... nothing to complain about ... so try it out (bonus points for rhyming!).  Stay Cheerful ;)",

Joshua was our server, and he was really friendly and attentive. The other staff was very attentive as well, always filling our water without having being asked to. It was nice, and not overly intrusive.   We ordered the bone in rib-eye, pan seared sea bass, & truffle fries. It was our anniversary so they treated us to a warm sticky toffee pudding dessert.   The rib-eye, according to the bf, was good. It was juicy and didn't need any additional seasoning or sauce. Cooked to a perfect medium rare...  The sea bass was absolutely divine! So tender and full of flavor, it just falls apart in your mouth. The mushrooms & asparagus were delicious pairings with the sea bass.   The truffle fries were amazing!!! A very generous portion that is easily shared btwn 2-4 people. A definite must try!!!  The warm sticky toffee pudding was super!! So moist, with fresh made whipped cram & toffee sauce... If you have a sweet tooth then you will enjoy it thoroughly.   Overall a really fantastic experience & would definitely recommend to try at least once!!",

Offering up an all-you-can eat surf and turf brunch, Envy had a full spread of crab legs, prime rib, tuna, chicken, waffle/omelet station, fresh bagels, etc.  They even have a personal bloody mary bar :) and wine tasting station ;).

I asked to substitute a baked potato and was told that since the sides were \"complimentary\" they couldn't substitute. At $40 for the steak there was nothing complimentary about the sides.   Most of our group ordered salads and various sides (instead of a standard entre)   The salads were enjoyed as were the mac and cheese, creamed corn, baked potato and mushrooms.

    "text": "Even though place has tons of reviews on Yelp, I always feel as if this restaurant is way underappreciated when it comes to the general public.  Whenever the topic of great Vegas steakhouses comes up, I seem to be the only one touting Envy.  My husband and I have dined here 4-5 times, and each time with the exception of Valentines day the restaurant has been practically empty.  Envy is one of my favorite steak restaurants in Vegas so far.  I'm extremely picky about the way my steak is cooked (mostly medium rare with a strip of cool red in the middle), and they've never gotten it wrong.  Steak-wise I generally go for the enormous bone-in ribeye while my husband goes for the more conservative filet mignon.  Both are cooked deliciously and always served with 3 different types of hawaiian salt.  Who knew that black salt tastes so different from red salt?  And both so wonderfully delicious.  I can't do a review about Envy without talking about the sides, though.  The number one shining star here are the truffle fries.  If you love truffles, your arteries will die happy eating these.  In fact, if you're not interested in dropping $50-80 a person, you can actually call in a to-go order of truffle fries for only $10 (and the portions are HUGE), just to check out their flavor.   Sometimes you just need some truffle fries.    My reviews of this place would probably be useless to non-truffle lovers, because my two other favorite side dishes at this fine establishment are the truffle macaroni and the truffle mashed potatoes.  Depending on when you go, one or the other may or may not be on the menu, but you can always ask if the chef is making it that day.  They're totally worth it.  The portions at Envy are always gigantic, and the value is wonderful.  Add that together with the fact that you can get a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon for $75 off of $150,  there really is no better value for the taste in Las Vegas.

We also ordered some french fries and mac and cheese.    The soup was very good, rich and very tasty.  The steak I ordered was medium, but it came back cooked a little bit more than my friend liked.  We did let the manager know when he asked us if the food was good and he kind of joked that we ate the whole meal and then complained.  The appetizers were ok.  The french fries were massive and were a meal in itself.    The dessert was also average at best.  I think for ambiance the envy steak house is ok but for food people can do better in Vegas. .",

We purchased a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon for $100 of the purchase of $200 for around $15 using a promo code. Figuring there was 3 of us i didn't think running up a $200 tab with drinks at a steakhouse would be difficult, and it wasn't.  We started with a couple rounds of drinks and an order of calamari. They also brought us wonderful complimentary bread and kept the drinks coming. We all ordered the bone in rib eyes which were fantastic. They were $45 each, but came with wonderful mashed potatoes and roasted vegtables. Along with that we ordered another side of mac and cheese which was great as well. We were so ful we skipped dessert and after the $100 discount the bill came out to around $160 for the three of us including tip. For this price, the meal was outstanding. The steak was of equal or greater quality that Ruth Chris or other higher end joints in Vegas and so was ther service, so for the price with the coupon you can't beat this place.  The only negative things about this place that it is a ways off the Stip. It is at least a 15 minute walk to Encore and about a 10 minute walk to the Las Vegas Hilton. Also, the place was dead around 7:15 on a Friday night. That didn't stop us from having a good time tho, but we did have to wait about 15 minutes after dinner for a cab.",

Why pay $$$ inside the convention hall for reheated frozen crap when you can step right outside and head over and grab a custom made Envy Signature Burger.  I always make sure to stop for one when I'm here for CES or SEMA.  Yeah it's $14, but it'll be better than anything from the concession stand.  And you'll get to relax while you enjoy it before heading back over to the show floor or calling it a day.",

Food was top notch and the prices weren't ridiculous for what you were getting.  The burger with onion crisps, bacon & mushrooms and a side of truffle fries was freaking great.  Friendly service and they serve their food at the bar right outside the restaurant.  Dinner menu looked good, and based on breakfast & lunch, I'd assume it to be great too.",

Coming to this hotel-i was in awe. it's an amazing beautiful hotel inside and out & I knew this we going to be great. We get there and was greeted so kindly & we told him about our deal-we weren't the only ones and was fully aware and ready to help us through it. So nice and helpfully We sat down and our waitress was so kind i can't remember her name but she was small and skinny with an accent i believe.. she was amazing and helped us out with picking out food and using our coupon to its max. Amazing atmosphere, amazing service. It happened to also be V-Day night but they accommodated us & despite being crowded with no reservations it worked out amazing... I can't wait to come back here and enjoy this amazing place! 10000/10000",

Garlic sauteed spinach was very good but I'd like more of the garlic hit.  Very good. Great service.

We received credit for every night we stayed to have breakfast here with the option of a la carte or buffet style. Breakfast runs until 1100.  The first time I got their Atlantic Smoked Salmon ($18). It was nicely presented, but I think the price is steep for a simple lox bagel if I didn't have hotel credit. I also got their Seasonal Fruit Plate ($15). It was a standard bowl that came with strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, and cantaloupe.   I would recommend the breakfast buffet option if anything. You get a good selection of foods for one price. There was really great steel cut oatmeal and an egg scramble station where you can add in what you want, including salsa, cilantro, onions, and etc. French toast was also available. Food was decent. Orange juice is included with the buffet, but it tasted like carton to me so I wasn't a fan.   Service was average. My first time here already left me sorely disappointed. First impressions are everything! I would recommend this place for breakfast ONLY if you have hotel credit, or you take the buffet route. Otherwise, I say pass. Seems like they are known for their dinner menu more.",

    "text": "It is really 3.5 stars. Rounded up due to the excellent and accommodating service.   I have to make an honest disclaimer - steakhouses annoy me. What you get typically doesn't worth what you have to pay for it.  Now, that it is out of the way, let's get to the review itself.  ENVY is located at inside of the Renaissance hotel in Las Vegas. We had dinner there, but not by choice - Las Vegas had a rare case of horrendous weather with very strong winds, so going out was a bad option. The restaurant offers very substantial wine list (they are recipients of one of the Wine Spectator awards). I didn't look much through the list, as was the only one drinking wine and only needed a glass. I ended up with a glass of Terra d'Oro Barbera from Amador County in California, which was excellent - but 9 oz pour at $19, which greatly exceeds the retail price of the whole bottle. For the first course, I had the Wedge salad - tiny piece of lettuce, probably one eighth of the head - but it was fresh and tasty.  For my main course, I had seared scallops - a whole of 4 scallops for $29. They were very nicely done, no questions, but again, price performance simply doesn't work for me.  We had multiple sides (roasted potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli rabe) - all very tasty.  Excellent, friendly and attentive service.  Would I recommend this place? There is nothing wrong with it, really, but Las Vegas offers so many great food options at a fraction of a price, so I would only say - eat there if you must.",

The dinner was absolutely amazing. For the appetizers we got a crab cakes and a lobster bisque soup. The crab cakes we not dry but moist and full of flavor. The bisque was great and really smooth. For the entrees my wife had a rib eye steak and I had the porter house. The steaks we cooked to perfection. I had a side of bernaise sauce that was excellent. For the sides we had a creamy garlic mashed potatoes. The potatoes had a garlic taste and really moist not dry. The desserts were cheesecake and puff pastries. I was so full I really didn't get a chance to enjoy the desserts until the next morning. The meal was well worth paying full price. Will be coming back.",

The decor is modern and unassuming but yet intimate and inviting.  Our servers were attentive, friendly, knowledgeable & had enough tact to give us our privacy.  My Filet Mignon was beautifully cut, aged, & tasted heavenly in my mouth.  The sides were excellent as well as the truffle fries received universal praise from our table.  Overall, I can say that it was a very pleasurable experience to dine at this steakhouse.  Envy indeed ...",

    "text": "I think a big part of this 5 stars review came from the level of services which we received during your visit.    The restaurant is located within Las Vegas Renaissance Hotel, which is a non-gaming business hotel.  Due to its location, it is usually quite on weekends and non-convention time.   It also effect the restaurant, too.  Since majority of the traffic to this restaurant came from the hotel guests.    We were immediately seated, there were multiple servers helped us with breads, water and menu ordering, talking about being treated like loyalty here!  Decor is contemporary elegant.  A nice place to take your date or special someone here, or even good for business lunch too. Since we visited during the lunch hours, so the menu selections are more limited.  However here are the break down:  Bread - Complimentary with meal. Regular Cabatta bread, Olive bread and cranberries walnut were all warm and fluffy.    Entree - We ordered French Dip sandwich which was moist and juicy (Serve with Au Jus and Horseradish), Chicken Pesto Sandwich served on freshly baked bread, and the Envy signature burger with choices of TWO cheeses, TWO toppings (mushroom, bacon..and more) on top of the traditional hamburger condiments (Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles).  It was a 1/2 lb burger so quite filling!  The patty was cooked to our liking as well.    All lunch Burgers/Sandwiches come with choice of fries or salad.  I strongly suggest to upgrade to truffle fries  ($3). Its worth every-penny.  Make sure to get coupons from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> so we ended up paying our meal for almost 50% off! What a deal!    I would recommend this place to others when visiting Vegas.",

The steaks are delish, but the standouts have to be all the appetizers and the sides. The corn is to-DIE-for, and the ceviche apps were great. Oh and you HAVE to try the stuffed tomatoes!  Losing a star only because you have to donate a kidney to afford the place. To save some money I recommend getting an app, side and entree for two people. It's more than enough food, trust me!",

Sure, we heard amazing things about this place, but it's another steakhouse in Vegas.  We finally took advantage of their <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon and had a cozy dinner for two.  First up - I made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> and requested we sit side by side.  Although I do note this in the reservation, it's rarely and sometimes noticed and acknowledged.  In this case, the booth had two settings specifically set up side by side.  Nice!  After a slight delay, we got our beverages and menus.  It wasn't too hard to decide.  We barely made a dent in our warm bread and butter when our entrees arrived.  * Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Wild Mushroom Sauce ($45) * Bone-In Ribeye, 17 oz with Brandied-Pink  Peppercorn Sauce ($45)  Both orders came with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted seasonal vegetables.  One thing I appreciated from our waiter (Joshua) was that he told us that we probably had enough food without ordering sides.  And this is usually the part where they push the sides on you, but not in this case.  And he was so right!  The 17 oz is a big piece of beef, and there's really not a whole lot of room left for much else.  The steaks were perfectly cooked rare, and tender and tasty!  So tasty that we didn't even bother with our respective signature sauces that came with it.  Rather, we didn't even care for the sauces at all.  The meat was flavorful all on its own and that's what you call a good piece of beef!  Of course, half the fun is experimenting with their three salts and seeing which one goes best with your dish.  The garlic mashed potatoes were also good, and the roasted seasonal vegetables also had a good mix of veggies which surprised us.  Different kinds of squash, beets, and mushrooms were part of it.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food.  Service was top notch and the food had us interested in the rests of their menu.  Of course, coupons definitely help in this department.  4.5 stars.",

People are right, who cares about the sauce, the thick steak with a pinch of salt will do you fine. You will stuff yourself silly with the truffle parmesan fries here also.   The red decor here screams W Hotel meet Texas de Brazil. I am especially surprise that this is not a gaming hotel; where do they make their money???   Some minor misses: The steak is sizzling hot but the plate is not. This usually leads to me not finishing my steak because it gets rather cold quickly. The medium here is more of a medium well so ask for medium rare if you want to see some juices in your Rib eye. I like my steakhouse poppin' but the customers here are sparse for a Friday Night.   overall 4.25 stars / 5",

We had a reservation for 7 people at 5PM on Saturday.   We ordered: Lamb chop-M NY steak-MR 3 Rib eye steak-MR Filet mignon-MR Ahi tuna special Spinach, truffle fries, and mushrooms  It took over 45 minutes to get our food and we were the only ones in the restaurant. When our steaks were served it was either undercooked or overcooked. We were short on time so didn't want to make it a big deal but did let our server know. Only an apology but didn't offer to take it back?! Come on, each steak was $50+.  My ahi tuna special was nothing special at all! It was bland and didn't even taste fresh!  Spinach and mushrooms were fine. You really can't mess up on that, can you? The truffle fries was the best thing we had! SAD!   We appreciate the slices of lemon cake and cheesecake you sent to the birthday folks but that doesn't justify the poorly served foods.  Your server was quite knowledgeable with the menu but can use a few customer service tips.   Thanks, but won't be back!",

One walked us to the restaurant. The lobby was sleek and modern. Rich red colors. The pool area looked inviting.  We were warmly greeted by the restaurant manger and seated right away.  We both loved the feel of the restaurant. Leather chairs and booths. Reminiscent of  days gone by, but in no way run down. Just a time when life was simpler.  We had two servers , Deonante and Christian, wonderful service by both. Christian was our main server, and did not in any way treated us differently due to our living  social deal. We were told about the menu, the specials and that each meal comes with the garlic mashed and the Brussels sprouts. We shared a caesar salad which was crisp and fresh and the dressing divine. We both chose the bone in filet. We also ordered the creamed bourbon corn.  The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, flavorful, and by far one of the best cuts of meat we have ever had. The corn was delicious and the cream pronounced with a slight taste of the bourbon. The potatoes delicious.     This was one of the finest meals we have ever had. I would select this restaurant over some of the other steakhouses I have been too.  We cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "Some friends and I had dinner at Envy a few weeks ago during a Vegas weekend trip.  The restaurant is located off the strip in the Renaissance Hotel which looks like your run of the mill business hotel.  I was actually surprised to find a steakhouse located inside. The interior of the restaurant has a nice, rich decor and pleasant ambiance.    The service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable and helpful in recommending two bottles of white and red wines for our table.    Our party of 8 ordered the following items:  Bourbon Creamed Corn Hands down the BEST creamed corn I've ever had.  It was mouth wateringly rich but not overly creamy and flavored with so much goodness.  The waiter had noted that this was the most popular dish on the menu and I completely understand why.  We originally had two orders of this dish but it was devoured pretty quickly so we ordered another.  Truffle Fries Tasty stick fries with truffle.  A very substantial serving - one order would have been plenty for our table but I'm quite sure we ordered two.   Bacon Gruyere Mashed Potato Pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary.   Entrees:  Ginger LIme Sea Bass I opted for the sea bass since it came recommended by one of our friends.  It was a very light dish in flavor and moist throughout.  The portion was quite generous as well.  Bone-in Ribeye My boyfriend ordered the bone-in ribeye which we thought was only decent at best.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Overall, ENVY steakhouse is worth a visit if you're looking for a nice meal off the strip.  The bourbon creamed corn absolutely blew us all away and remains the most memorable part of our dinner.  I'd go back just for that dish!",

The truffle fries here were GOOD! and worth the $9.   Spice-Seared Ahi Tuna with the Sesame-Seaweed Salad, Pacific Rim Sauce - $16 - pricy for what you get but never the less tasty!  I had the Warm Spinach salad with Goat Cheese Croquette, Pancetta, Warm Bacon-Balsamic Vinaigrette - 4.5 stars!  Ambience is nice and service is pretty good too.",

It's dark and quiet and the staff were exceedingly polite and helpful.   I had a bone-in filet mignon which was quite good; I've never had a filet served bone-in. Very tender, very tasty, done to perfection.   It's a bit off the beaten track (the Renaissance is right near the convention center, and if you take the monorail, there's a short walk across a parking lot to get there) and tends toward the pricey, but made a nice change of pace from the Strip.",

The service provided by our waitress was great. We ordered the tomahawk steak and ribeye, medium and medium rare, respectively. Both steaks came out medium well. The worse part was that the tomahawk was not to be presliced since we wanted to take photos. The waitress told the kitchen not to slice it. But when the steak arrived it was pre-sliced. This ended up being a very disappointing and frustrating dinner.",

My GPS decided to route me to a sketchy part of town, but eventually the directional mishap was fixed.  When we got here, our server (Jacob, Justin, Joseph?) was very polite, friendly, and professional. He didn't give us any attitude for using a coupon or not ordering wine. I really appreciated that.   Our server suggested the $95 tomahawk steak, which would be perfect for sharing for two. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese. While we were waiting, we had a nice warm bread basket and butter brought to us. An amuse bouche of gazpacho was brought out for us to try before our steak was served.   We asked for the steak to be cooked bloody rare, and they did the cut justice. The attempt to finish the food was quite a feat. There were leftovers despite our best efforts. The steak was brought out with a trio of salts, which were nice to try. Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. I'm very pleased with Envy and I would recommend it as a dining option to someone looking for a fancy feast in Vegas.",

    "text": "In a town of many, many quality steak joints, this place is still worth mentioning. It's no Carnevino or Cut, but the prices won't give you a heart attack, either. Their wine list was well priced and they had a nice lineup of seafood options for those that aren't into red meat.   I made the \"mistake\" of getting the crab stuffed filet. Although it was decent, I can't say it really was a good chance to try to real quality of the meat. I'll assume the other steaks are better based on reactions from the diners at my table that didn't select the crab stuffed filet !  The special salts and sauces served with the steaks are pretty awesome. They include 3 different primo salts and a choice from a nice list of sauces (bernaise, peppercorn, etc). I like that these things are included. They also include a portion of veggies - a nice value add as well.   Service was well... weird. We asked for a particular '05 wine and were brought the '06 and he was a little rude when we said we didnt' want the '06. It was a little annoying that he tried to pretend it was the year we asked for when it wasn't! Also, one of our diners was brought the completely wrong steak (ribeye instead of filet!). He ate it anyway, but they apologized quite a bit and gave us a discount.   I'll come back for the real stuff next time (mb a filet or ribeye!), but my overall impression was good. For a top tier steakhouse at not-so-bad prices (especially with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon!), this place should be on your short list.",

Our Open Table reservation mentioned our celebration, and they shined at making me feel special with that thoughtful gesture.  Our waiter was very informed and enthusiastic about the wine selection. We shared a bottle of a special house wine that was very tasty and went well with our meal.  My Love and I shared the spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, warm bacon-balsamic vinaigrette with bacon on top. It was really good, and a very interesting flavor. Our friends shared the Caesar salad with romaine leaves, white anchovy, and black pepper croutons, and both agreed it was the best Caesar salad they've ever had.  The four of us did the best style of eating, what I call tag-team eating, where we order two different items and share, so we can try more dishes. Our party ordered two of each of the: -17 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye -Chilean Sea Bass  The rib-eye was absolutely delicious. It wasn't just large. It was large, tender, well-seasoned, and well-grilled.  The sea bass just melted like butter in your mouth. It was so good!  The sides were good, too. The roasted seasonal vegetables were fresh and seasoned with rosemary. The garlic mashed potatoes were smooth and satisfying.  My friends shared a dessert, the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with pistachio ice cream and mint sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fy4t2XHIRKwMk_ocCZze0Q?select=bzRDV05eD7MojFn3rnRsWQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Fy4t...</a>).

Many were dressed rather informally (not us), which was kind of surprising.  My boyfriend thought it was because we saw a \"Welcome -insert engineering firm here-\" sign.  The atmosphere was very calm and friendly.  Service was great, I really like how our waitress attentively watched all of her tables in case they needed anything.  We had the signature 19 oz bone in ribeye done \"medium-plus\" between medium and medium well - because my boyfriend likes it rarer than I do.  It was definitely right on the money, but you could really taste the effect of the dry aging on the more rare parts, it was fantastic.   We also had the beef cheeks that had been slow cooked for several hours.  The beef cheeks were ridiculously tender, had a pretty thick balsamic vinegar sauce, and tasted better when in the same bite as the truffle mashed potatoes they were served with.  This was a good dish to try, but I'd go back for the ribeye.  We didn't order any side dishes and were still pleasantly full from 2 entrees.

We had trouble finishing our main course due to trying to restrain ourselves from eating all the fries and the delicious warm bread selection.    We had a NY strip, filet mignon and sea bass.  All three were exceptional.  The service was great and the wine list is reasonable.  Although I would have liked a sauvignon blanc choice from New Zealand.  The sides are also tasty.

When we left, there were maybe 5. We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, so thank goodness we didn't pay full price for this place, because I would've rather taken my money to Fleming's.  Our waiter was this super mellow guy, and was really nice. He did pay attention to details because he knew we didn't want ice in our water and made sure he didn't accidentally pour it in when it came to refills. It's the little things.  Well, the big thing was the price. We ordered the 10 oz. filet mignon to share between us for $45 and paid a $5 split plate charge. $45?? Are you kidding me?? We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table.   What was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte.   They had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like. I still felt like I was in a hotel, and I thought the decor was trying a bit hard to be on a more upscale than what it really was. At least I didn't have to dress up to eat here. They didn't balk at my track suit jacket I had with me because I was too lazy to pack anything dressy for the trip.   So glad we didn't pay full price for it. It was barely worth it even with the coupon. I do not have steak ENVY.",

It was our anniversary and the staff made us feel so special, from beginning to end.  My partner is picky and he was very happy and satisfied with his meal and overall experience.  We returned two more times and continued to have the same satisfaction. All members of the staff have always been very nice and attentive.  We had the young lady serve us twice (forgive me, I forgot her name... I feel horrible) and she was always so pleasant and awesome. She even greeted us when she wasn't our server.   We enjoy this place when we don't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of the strip but want a nice night out.",

I went with the New York Steak and my bro had the Ribeye. The Lobster mac n cheese was on point. I'm especially impressed with Stephanie's suggestions for things to do while in Vegas. I would share but I'd like took keep these hidden gems between her me and my brother. I will be back in 3 weeks and will be definitely coming back to Envy The Steakhouse and asking for Stephanie.",

The Burger was good....not great.  The Fries were outstanding.  The service was good and my meeting went well.  Overall it was a good experience, but for $14 I've had better Burgers.  Will I return?  I usually have business lunches here because of it's proximity to the Strip & Convention Center.....so I will probably return.  I wouldn't take the family here for dinner....just not good enough for the price in my opinion.",

    "text": "This is a very average steakhouse for the money.  I say this with having been to many excellent steakhouses around the country, but locally steakhouses that charge the same amount but are far better include: The Striphouse, Andiamo and Morton's to name a few.  I'm not trying to be hurtful in my review, but if you're going to charge these prices I expect a couple things great, flavorful food and outstanding customer service.  Neither of these were displayed.  If this had been one of my very first steakhouses I had ever been to I probably would have thought it to be ok, but when when you're in the vacation destination of the world...step it up or charge a reasonable amount for what you get.  You have competition and they are currently killing you.   My husband and I ordered the Tomahawk steak for 2 ($95) and we ordered it rare (we're from the midwest and like our beef with the most flavor) along with the asparagus and lobster mac n cheese.   What I didn't like: How little seasoning or flavor there was to the Tomahawk.  The tomahawk was served with asparagus (which is not noted on the menu) this would have been wonderful if the server knew what dishes came with what for the evening and then we would have tried another option. The bernaise sauce was fair, it almost tasted sour.  The service was average for an Applebee's.  We were there on a Wednesday night - it was not busy.  We waited, for everything...them to take our order, for drink refills, the check.  From the time we sat down until our food arrived at our table was 50 minutes - unacceptable. Things I liked: They didn't charge you $5 for sauces for your steak like some other places do.  All of their sides were only $8 I just feel like people should know that for the same amount of money they can have much tastier steaks and extremely better service at other steakhouses in the area for the same price or less.",

When we first got there, hostess(sorry, u were amazing but forgor yout name) welcomed us, and seated us simultaneously. Our server was Major and he explained briefly about the menu. We ordered   Appetizer Cocktail Shrimp : I do not like the shrimp, but my girl told me that it was amazing Crab Cake: Delicious, tasted amazing, was not plain, nor too strong with lot of sauce  Entree Bone-in Ribeye: Mid rare, it was crispy outside, juicy incide, just like I always wanted steak to be Porterhouse: Huge, Juicy inside, wished it was as crispy as ribeye outside, but it was still good  Side Wild Mushroom: very soft, a bit salty, but it was still good  French Fries, i think it was called \"frites\": amazing, thin crispy french fries with parmesan cheese on the top.  Dessert   Cheesecake : topped with some berries. How can it be wrong?  Chocolate cake : Had a side of scoop of ice cream. It was tasty and great finish for us  Food was amazing like what i mentioned above, but what surprised me from our server Major is that he realized my girl was having hard time which side she wants to get between mushroom and frites. at the end, We chose mushroom. Major wanted to make sure we have a great experience, and he surprised us by letting chef know that we were hesitating between mushroom and frites. He got us both sides to eat so we get the full experience! Which was quite a surprise, and Envy Team went above and beyond. We are glad we decided to visit here instead of one of the steakhouse inside of the strip. We will definitely be back.  Thank you envy team!",

Service was good, waiter professional and attentive.   Steak came out under cooked, Mac and cheese came out hot. Sent the steak back to have it cooked more but when it came back it was still under cooked. Mac and cheese was now cold. Brought mashed potato's as a way of saying sorry - problem was they were cold as well...  So, under cooked steak, cold Mac and cheese and Luke warm potatoes. No visit from the manager and it took forever for the bill to arrive.   I expected more and the manager should have made a table visit. Again I'd skip this place and go somewhere else.  Shared my experience with the front desk and they said they would share it with the food and beverage manager.   No contact, reached back out with the front desk and they confirmed they did share it with him. Still no contact or email.   So even with a complaint or concern the food and beverage manager didn't feel the need to reach out and chat.   Skip this place - not very good and no customer service",

One these sins is Envy- I'm sorry but this Envy is worth experiencing once in your life... Yes Envy Steakhouse in Las Vegas. Me and my wife really wanted a nice Steak dinner, and trust me Envy was, is, and will be the spot we enjoy for hopefully many years to come. Located within the Renaissance Hotel absolutely gorgeous hotel, the restaurant located inside is beautiful as well. If your looking for great service look no further, we had the best server Joshua, really great guy. Seated right away the menu is great, offering all the steaks you would want, my wife ordered the 18oz. Ribeye, which was cooked perfectly. I had ordered the Filet Mignon and a lobster tail on the side which came stuffed with a crab cake overtop, great dinner. We had enjoyed an ice bottle of Groth that I had brought in, which they do charge a corkage fee but the manager took care of us, wife allergic to wine. But, there is a major star of this show that deserves all to partake in, it's the Mac N' Cheese, This has to be the best Mac n' Cheese I've had not just in along time, but ever. Jakes Mac n' Cheese from Truxtons was one of the best and now gone off the menu, but trust me, please if you go and enjoy a very nice dinner, please please please order the Mac n' Cheese. To top the dinner off we ordered the Cheesecake, fantastic flavor with fresh berries on top. From The Ambiance, to the service, and the food was amazing, we will be remembering this dinner for years to come, I hope we return way before that, trust me, if you all knew what we had experienced you would be Envious, so please next time in Las Vegas, your going to experience Gluttony, Lust, maybe Greed, do yourself a favor and begin your evening with Envy!",

Anywho, the waiter was very nice, explained the groupon and how it works, which I already knew, but he was nice about it. I was a little bummed that I ordered a ribeye and the waiter came back apologizing that they're out, so I picked the porterhouse. I really wanted the marbled ribeye though !! Ughh. Anyways, the portions were huge, it was delicious. We both got the same thing with the bortelaise sauce. Very red wine tasting, it went great with the steak. Over all everything was delish! And great service. I only ate half of mine and we ended up donating the other half with the fries to a homeless man. Btw, we were dressed up. Looked fancy in there.",

The shrimp in the cocktail were jumbo size.  Next our ribeye bone- in steaks were delivered, cooked to our specifications.  Delicious Nebraska Beef.  We shared mashed potatoes that were the real deal and tasted amazing.  Although very stuffed, we finished with a chocolate mousse cake that was sinfully good.  Such wonderful friendly staff, a very private booth seating and great food makes Envy a great place to eat.  I am a fan and recommend checking out this place.",

    "text": "This place would not be my choice for dinner in Vegas. It is ok, but in a city like Vegas where there are so many amazing restaurants, being ok isn't good enough. I made this reservation about two weeks in advance. When we arrived, I was taken to my table within 2 minutes then proceeded to have to stand there as the (host? manager?) cleared the table and reset it as we had been taken to a dirty table. As we were being seated, we were asked if we had a groupon or travelzoo offer (which we didn't). I was confused about why we were asked when other tables we saw being seated weren't asked. Maybe we \"looked\" like bargain hunters? Our server David came and asked us if we were ready to order. He didn't go over any specials or recommend anything on the menu. We ordered drinks which he brought quickly (they had a pretty nice wine list) then ordered our entrees and proceeded to 35 minutes for our food to arrive. He stopped by once during that time and said he would check on our food. When it finally arrived our entrees were very good while the sides were incredibly bland. We had the sea bass and herb crusted lamb. The fish was incredibly tender and had a great flavor. The lamb was good but not very different than what I've had in other places. We had a show to go to so we asked for our check which was brought promptly. Overall this visit was largely underwhelming. I enjoyed my visit to the Top of the World the previous evening much more.",

Service was fine, but food was really nothing to write home about although the sea bass was quite good. Lamb was salty and lacked any real flavor and my coworker who order chicken parmigiana (I know, you don't go to steakhouses to order chicken parmigiana but she doesn't eat red meat) came out with the chicken almost completely raw. They took that and her glasses of wine off of the bill as a make good which was a nice gesture. We also had a side of asparagus which was barely cooked and had no seasoning. In general, many other places to eat at for the same prices or cheaper that are significantly better than this place in Vegas.",

We calculated that with for the price of an entree per person (there was 4 of us), we'd get 3 sides and 2 desserts extra. It was too good of a deal to pass up.  The three sides we ordered were the truffled french fries, mac and cheese and wild mushrooms. The french fries were quite addicting and we couldn't get enough of it. On top of that, it was HUGE, the 4 of us couldn't finish it (with our meals of course). The mac and cheese was done the way I like it. Crispy on the outside, and not too wet on the inside. The mushrooms went well with our meal, but didn't exactly wow us.  We ordered the Sea Bass and Rib eye and NY strip. We weren't big fans of the meat. It wasn't as juicy or tender as we thought it'd be. Honestly, Ruth Cris would have tasted better. Maybe they were having an off night.  The Sea bass was delicious though. Cooked to perfection, I think all the guys wished they ordered the sea bass instead of the meat after tasting it. It was definitely cooked well.  We ordered the Bittersweet Chocolate Lava Cake and Grand Marnier Panna Cotta for dessert. Both were delicious but the lava cake got absolutely destroyed first.   The service was great. Our server, Josh, treated us like royalty. The best part was at the end of the meal, we hadn't printed out our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon.

We were all disappointed with the service and the food.  Being that the restaurant was empty, our food came out about an hour and half late, cold and bland.   Two of my friends ordered New York strips (well done) and received filet mignon (medium well).  The lobster mac-n-cheese tasted like they poured their lobster bisque soup over elbow noodles.  When the waiter returned with the New York strips, the inside was still medium well, which caused my partner and friend to return the food.  While one waiter bought out the birthday cake another waiter began distributing the dessert plates with no forks which made no sense because we then had to recollect them to place the slices of the cake on the plates...and still they did not bring out forks after we requested them.  We ended up cleaning our dinner forks to eat our cake.  Let just say, I would never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.  If I had to describe ENVY Steakhouse in one word-GARBAGE!",

We were almost full after the appetizers.   We ordered the rib eye and it was disappointing. Both rib eyes seemed burnt on the outside and I could taste the burntness. It was cooked medium in the inside, but it tasted bland. For a $45 steak, I expected more.   I ordered the creme brele for desert and it was only OK. The caramelized sugar was over flamed and it too had a burnt flavor.   The one good thing was the waiter was extremely nice and professional.

We got there a little late but our table was waiting for us mainly because there was a whopping 4 tables sat in the entire dining room at nearly 8pm.  The service was incredibly slow, to the point where how long it would take between courses or until we even saw our server again were the running jokes throughout the meal. We waited for EVERYTHING which is astonishing considering there was no business in the venue.  The food was typical steakhouse with zero flare and creativity. My ribeye was one of the thinnest cut ribeyes I have ever seen, I will say it was cooked a perfect MR which is nice to see. The side I had ordered, Mac n cheese, wasnt even brought to the table (somehow managed to get Wild Mushrooms instead).

    "text": "Brunch for $30 a person in Vegas can either be a heavenly steal or a wasted money nightmare in which you find yourself squeezed in between overweight, \"starved\" tourists wanting to maximize quantity for their buck.  Envy was luckily the former. We were here for brunch on Halloween and enjoyed the atmosphere of regulars being dressed up and mingling in large groups of friends and family.   Brunch here includes unlimited champagne or mimosas - never a good idea when a Russian and a German come in, we will destroy your bubbly supply! Our server caught on soon that we take unlimited to heart and she rapidly refilled our flutes every few minutes. Empty plates were also removed swiftly each time we ventured out to the buffet again. If you don't care for champagne all that much, just go wild at the build-your-own bloody mary bar!  The selection of food was great. It wasn't a mass-appeal kind of buffet, but rather a well-rounded selection of top notch items. The omelet station had any ingredient you could possibly want from jalapenos to applewood smoked bacon. My favorite was the large plate tower of chilled crab legs and shrimp. I was missing my tartar sauce however, I don't care for cocktail sauce.  Envy's carved prime rib is possibly the best one I have ever had. Too bad I targeted the lunch-type food last, I couldn't have more than a slice. I'll save some more space for it next time I'm here.  One thing that gets me to completely ignore calories, carbs and sugar overdoses at buffets are the desserts. Most buffets have those cute little shot glass desserts and I generally take about 10 different kinds until I need to be rolled out of the restaurant. Envy had a smaller than usual dessert selection, but it did not disappoint! The bread pudding topped with raspberries had me zone out until the last crumb was devoured. I'd come back here just for that!  Envy, you make other brunches in Vegas envious with your quality food, excellent service and cozy atmosphere.",

I dined again mid-June 2011 and was disappointed.  They no longer offered the filet on the menu, only \"steak\" options was a New York steak sandwich.  I was not impressed by this sandwich, it was tough.  I upgraded to truffle fries which are truffled reggiano'ed heaven!  I would go here and just eat these.  I guess you have to go at dinner time to get a good steak at ENVY now days.  The service is great--polite and attentive.",

The classics are there like bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, and create your own omelet, but they also have fancy cheeses, fruits fresh sliced meats, and all you can drink wine or bloody mary's.  I believe you can also order off the menu, but we enjoyed the buffet.  Great meal, with some nice music in the background = perfect morning!

I loved the place and had to come back, however I am giving this place 4 stars because I was caught in complete surprise when my Caesar Salad came out, it was literally Romaine lettuce on a plate with a HUGE \"crouton\", the lettuce was not even chopped! So my advice, don't get the Caesar salad because it is something you can put on a plate within 1 minute  I got the Lobster Mac&Cheese as a side and I can honestly say that it was AMAZING!   Despite my bad experience with the Caesar Salad, the service was great, and the atmosphere was nice and calm!",

Yes there are better options around the rest of Las Vegas but if you want to go somewhere just off the strip and a little more quiet this is a great place. Very fair prices, New York steak for under 60 dollars, good wine list and a simple but diverse menu. The steak my party ordered was cooked to perfection which is critical regardless of the grade of beef being prepared. Service was incredible and timed the meal perfectly. Came here on a groupon, would definitely go again! Josh was our waiter and he did an excellent job of taking care of the party!",

    "text": "Kristine treated me to this restaurant for my birthday since she knows I love steaks. To get to the restaurant, you have to pass by a fancy looking lobby with this big chandelier, and you know we just had to do a photo op haha. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is very romantic, definitely a date place, with the dimmed lights and the candles on the table. The waitress was kind and friendly and always checked up on us.  We ordered some appetizers, Black Pepper Calamari and Rock Shrimp and an Oven-Roasted Stuffed Tomato. The calamari was okay, just normal. The stuffed tomato had a really nice presentation, and it tasted really good with the Portobello mushrooms and fennel cream sauce. I ordered the 17oz Bone-In Ribeye, and it was cooked how I wanted it, except for the outside being a little overcooked. It was juicy and flavorful, and I wouldn't mind having it again. Kristine ordered the Pan-Seared Seabass, and I thought its presentation was very well done. The shitake mushrooms and asparagus were a good combination, the truffle butter crust added a nice crunch and flavor, and the port wine reduction sauce added a little bit of a kick, but not too overpowering. We also ordered a side of Truffle-Reggiano Fries, which was a huge serving that could have probably served at least 4 people. It's definitely one of the best truffle fries I've had, though I wish the cheese was melted a bit more. To end our dinner, we ordered Creme Brulee to share, and they were nice enough to add a birthday greeting on the plate.  Overall, a good dining experience. Good food, excellent service, excellent presentation, good atmosphere. I thought the quality of the food could have been better given the expensive prices.",

From the moment you walk in you are made to feel that you are the most important person in the room. Michael, the manager ensures consistent attention and the highest level of service from pouring the water to clearing off the plates. Our server, David,  was seamless, professional and understated.  We had ordered the filet, and added the surf option.  Scottish Salmon and Scallops.  The salmon was some of the best I have ever tasted, and we come from the Pacific Northwest.  The calamari and rock shrimp appetizer was very tasty and could easily serve 4-6.  The accompanying sauce [ginger green sauce, and bloody mix with ketchup] enhanced an already wonderful dish.  This finale was a chocolate torte drizzled with raspberry sauce, that rivaled, [not exceeded] the chocolate torte at Jakes Crawfish in Portland Oregon.  The first McCormick and Schmick restaurant.",

The watermelon was refreshing especially on this hot day (93 degrees F)  Bourbon corn:  ($9) This is what made us come back. The corn gods have blessed the corn and allowed me to eat it. I honestly wanted to just order 3 of these but I thought it would be weird. Get this guys!!! It's a must.    Lobster Mac and cheese: ($9) This was a great addition to top off the Bourbon corn. Creamy cheese and real chunks of lobsters. You just have to try it!  Service was and is, excellent. I don't know any server who has ever been this courteous and funny!

    "text": "So, this place is... not cheap. I knew it wouldn't be, but still, dang. We were here because groupon was running one of those extra-20% off specials they run periodically, I was looking for the best 20% off I could find, and I was going to be in Vegas for a weekend. So we got an 80 dollar voucher for 30 dollars, and we still ended up spending another 50ish dollars after tip (for two people). So, not cheap. But I knew that going in.   So, was it worth it? Not sure it would be at full price, but given the discounted (but still expensive) price we paid, I'd say yes. It's super classy, the service was fantastic, and their steak, while I don't think I'd feel like paying 50 dollars for one unless I were way rich, was indeed a very good steak. Not the best I'd ever had, but definitely top 5, at least.   Was kind of funny, though - I saw one review saying something like this was a great steakhouse for people who don't like steak. I don't remember why they said that, but it's kind of True, for one reason: while their steaks are very good, they're also stupid pricey; their sides, however, are also very good, and an unexpectedly great value. We tried their lobster mac&cheese, which was super lobstery and pretty substantial, as well as their specialty, the truffle fries, which I wish had been less salty so the truffle could shine more, but they were still pretty truffly, and you get a *ridiculous* amount. 8 dollars each, and both highly recommended.   We also got the extra fun of goggling at their wine list, which they are quite proud of, and I can see why - a very small fraction of said list is actually remotely *affordable*, but it's certainly entertaining to gawk at. It's mostly the kind of wine list that yells \"this restaurant is not cheap\", the kind of wine list you order off of if you're either a. a millionaire bringing a date so you can show off to your date the fact that you're a millionaire, or b. a businessperson bringing a prospective client so you can show off to your client that your expense account has no limit on it. That said, they do have a *few* reasonably priced wines on there, including a very good ice wine (we had that for dessert, and were pretty pleased with it. Don't see ice wine on menus too often.)",

After checking out the menu my wife and I mentioned that we were going to sample each of the two entrees ordered. What came out from the kitchen was a beautiful, impromptu surf and turf dish with a half order on each of our plates. The 10oz filet ($49) was savory and tender with a flavor enhanced by a trio of specialty salts served on the side. Next to the filet was a pan seared Chilean seabass ($36) coated with a buttery, crunchy truffle flavored crust. The delicate and flakey fish was the highlight of the meal and one of the better fish dishes I've had in a while.   As a side we ordered their signature whiskey cream corn ($10). Creamy and full of chunks of bacon, it added to an otherwise rich meal. The restaurant is even kid-friendly even though there isn't a dedicated kid's menu. My kid got a massive bowl of buttered spaghetti noodles ($12). To finish up the meal, we shared the warm sticky toffee pudding ($9). While not nearly as good as the mind-blowing version at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the large square brick was decent. However, the grainy brown sugar mouthfeel prevented us from devouring it like we would normally do to a dessert.  This place may not have the sizzle and sex appeal of other steakhouses in town, but it's a solid, less expensive alternative. The execution was better than expected, plating was thoughtful and meticulous, and service was as friendly and personable as you'll find anywhere in town.",

Arrived 15 minutes prior to the reservation time I made on Open table and Leroy (the host) was very nice about seating us at the nearest booth table. I love booth tables!   Then our server, Krisztian, thanked me for being a return customer (guess he checked my open table account). It has been a while since the last time I was here so we relied heavily on Krisztian's knowledge and suggestions.    We decided on ENVY's signature Chilean sea bass and the bone in filet (ordered medium,  per Krisztian's recommendation). The sea bass came with two separate sides: a heaping side of mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts.  The sea bass was buttery and tender. The steak was cooked just right and was juicy. The portion was enough for two people. We were more than satisfied with the flavors of every dish and our stomachs were happily full.  We asked for our check but instead, we were surprised with a slice of moist red velvet cake, topped with berries,  as a thank you for being a return customer.  What a way to make us feel special and appreciated! The overall food experience is a 4/5 but the service we received made our overall dining experience a 5\\5!!  Free self parking at the hotel. Don't follow Google map, the directions were wrong. Just looked for the hotel once you get close enough.",

My boyfriend and I shared the wedge. I got the bone in ribeye and he got the filet. We were warned by our server to not overdo  it on the sides since they were a generous portion. We settled on the bourbon corn and Dijon grilled asparagus. Bomb! Sticky toffee pudding was to die for! Our server was awesome too Wish I remembered his name... Josh? He could have easily oversold us on more food that we would have never finished. He was friendly, extremely knowledgeable. Gave us the perfect balance of attention and privacy. Added plus... As locals it is pretty awesome to go have a great meal without dealing with the crowd of the strip. We will DEFINATELY go again!  Only downfall (no fault of ENVY) was that I tried to make a reservation through opentable and it said nothing was available until 9. I called and easily got a table for 7:30. When we showed it was pretty empty too. Sure it was just a glitch but I am sure a limited time may discourage people especially if people are on a time crunch before a show, etc.",

    "text": "From the courtesy rsvp call when we were running late up to the friendly farewells on the way out.  By far Envy provided 5 star service for our Saturday night dinner.   Even though we were being Travelzoo voucher moochers, they didn't make me feel in this slightest cheap-o about it.    The hotel itself had a fun clubby vibe with some event going on.  As you enter the restaurant it looks like Drai's nightclub from the 2000's.  Not too dark, still romantically lit.  The chairs we sat in were extra comfy.  The decor is not my cup of tea but I'd find it drinkable.  Upscale still.  This menu apparently is the same one they've had for years.  It was our 1st time so I may be wrong.  Either way I can tell that the chefs do know what they're doing back there.  I quit eating land meats so we came to a steakhouse and didn't eat steak.  Not to worry, they had many pesceterian dishes.    We started with the Calamari & Rock Shrimp appetizer.  The squid was tender!  Like for the first time a restaurant got that right.  Hallelujah!   Not rubbery not chewy.  Breading was a nice crunchy batter.  There was maybe 10% shrimp. 4/5  Next came the piece de resistance!  The Seafood Plateau consisted of 4 collosal shrimp, 3 giant king crab legs, 1/2 maine lobster, 4 small blue point oysters, 4 clams, 4 mussels with 3 dippings.  I think it was bloodymary, aioli & sweet butter.  Sharing this was a feat.  All of it was superb quality shellfish.  The best.  5/5  After this we ordered the mountain of Truffle Fries.  Holy sh*t dude!  There had to be a sack of potatoes and a 1/4 cup of truffle oil on there.  I couldn't stop eating them.  It was embarrassing.  I admit to having a truffle addiction, oil, shavings, whole.  It doesn't matter I'll eat it if it's truffled.  [Psst, even on vanilla ice cream] 5/5  For mains we both decided on the Envy Sea bass.  Mustard crusted on top of asparagus and mushrooms.  It is much thicker than the pictures look.  A very good dish.  I wish it had some salted butter though to push it over the top.  4/5  No room for dessert.  The drinks were good and we had a wonderful waiter named Krisztian.  He really made the dinner a completely positive experience!  It gets hard for me to rate 5 stars on Yelp these days but I have no problem issuing it for Envy based on our experience.   We will be returning.",

    "text": "MAKE SURE YOU SEARCH FOR CURRENT DEALS!   We decided to go with this steakhouse instead of one of the other many options in LV because there's multiple deals going on right now, plus they have a good review on yelp. We bought the Travelzoo deal ($79 for $149 worth of food) and it was definitely a great experience.  From the host, to the server, and even the guy clearing our table, everyone was very nice and welcoming. Great service the entire time we were there.   For a party of 2, the $149 worth of food was more than enough.   Shrimp cocktail: Comes with 3 large shrimps, avocado mousse, and a small trio of sauces on the plate. DELICIOUS! My husband savored every bite.   Caesar salad: Came whole with 2 anchovies on top (which I immediately removed). Delicious! Most caesar dressings that I've tried are too sour, but this one was perfectly rich.   15 oz Rib-eye: Very tender, not overly seasoned, and cooked PERFECTLY. My husband thought that it could've used more seasoning, but I appreciated having control over the amount of salt on my steak. I couldn't get enough of it.   Sea Bass: A little on the small side (as expected). My husband said it was delicious and cooked perfectly. Moist and flaky. He didn't care for the asparagus that came with the sea bass, but overall, he enjoyed it.   Garlic Mash potato: Good, but would've been better if it had a smoother consistency and had a stronger garlic taste.   Bourbon creamed corn: Delicious!   Truffle Fries: Overrated. The only part of the meal that I did not care for. It was just too salty for me and with the exception of the portion size, it really didn't impress me.  Brussel Sprouts: Husband enjoyed it.   Garlic Spinach: Decent, but wouldn't order again. \"Too mushy\" was what my husband said.   BEST PART: At the end of our meal, our waiter (Matt) brought out the dessert menu. There wasn't anything on the menu that interested us, so my husband jokingly asked for \"Berries and Cream\" (i.e. fruit and whipped cream). Matt said sure! even though it wasn't even on the menu. AWESOME SERVICE and that \"Berries and Cream\" was the perfect dessert!  I would definitely come here again. One of the best meal experience I've had.",

    "text": "Review based on their lunch menu -   As I attend a few trade shows each year at the convention center across the street the Envy Steakhouse is a life saver as it's a great spot to take clients for a business  lunch in a casual yet classy environment. As those who have done shows at the convention center know the food there is pretty much the standard fast food slop. It's an easy walk over to Envy to enjoy a proper lunch and get off the show floor for a little while. Always good to get re-energized with some decent food before heading back to the grind.  During lunch hours they offer a menu of items from their Grill 55. It's not an overly large menu but has just the right amount to choose from. Comfort food classics mixed in with some American cuisine foods, along with a wine and cocktail selection. Service is very attentive and professional. The food comes out pretty quick. Both times I was here this past week during the Infocomm Show I ordered the Mediterranean Salad - Arugula, Heirloom Tomatoes, Kalamata Olives,  Bocconcini Mozzarella, Glazed Pistachios, dressed with Local Honey Basil Balsamic Vinaigrette and Grilled Salmon on top. Nice plate of food that was pretty tasty and not gut busting - especially when having to go back to work the convention center!  Just the perfect spot for a business lunch on an expense account, and well worth avoiding the convention center barely edible food.",

And in the end another persin and I paid $75 for their dinner and wine pairing.  I ended up slightly drunk after my dinner.    My dinner was the foie gras..which I have had better but the salad after more than made up for it.  The steak was done to perfection and very tasty.  And omg their creamed corn was delish...the main reason for me coming here.  As for dessert I don't really remember what I had.  Our other 2 dining companions had the Envy signature tasting.  Nicely presented and very good.  Also, the bday girl with us got a dessert on the house and some wine.  Definitely a great place to for dinner to get away from all the excitement of the Strip.  The next time I come back I would like to try their brunch with the unlimited alcohol.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to try this establishment 2x in 3 days.   1st visit:  Met up with my local friends in Vegas, New Years Eve.  They wanted to take me to a Japanese restaurant for dinner but the Las Vegas strip was close and jammed.  Upscale restaurants required reservation or have at least 1-2 hours wait time.  Since this steakhouse is within the hotel I'm staying, I suggested we try this place instead.  We had no reservation but the gentleman host ushered us right in. I did informed him I was a guest in their hotel so I don't know if this is why we were able to get a table without reservation or was it just not busy? We were dressed for the occasion that evening.  Everyone was absolutely at their best.  Service was tops. Food was amazing.  Our 2nd visit here was unplanned.  We were unprepared;  was dressed in Jeans, t-shirts/polo shirt, tennis shoes and a hat (long night) but we were still accommodated very well.  The lady host ushered us in without issues.  No sniding looks or attitude, she was actually very friendly.  Servers was just as friendly.  Food was again amazing (most part).    PROS: - Mac and triple cheese absolutely delicious. - Pan seared sea bass was amazing - I enjoyed the bold bursting flavor of the truffled crust.   - Roasted butternut squash soup was my toddler's fav. here. - Very friendly, attentive, well converse and lively servers.   - 3 kinds of seasoned salts (loved the Australian flavor best) - Upscale with warm traditional decor - Elegant food presentation, as expected.    CONS: - Filet Mignon was just a bit above average.  Yes, flavor was there; prepared and cooked well but it did not really impress me.  Maybe I was just expecting more.  I was hoping for something exciting, a bolder flavor or something different than other upscale steak house out there.    - VERY LIMITED choices in the menu.  They did not have a lot of beef steak choices or variety in there menu that weekend I visited.  There's only 2 types of beef steaks  (inbone rib eye and filet mignon) But they do have 3 types seafood in the menu (Seabass, tiger shrimp and salmon).  What's up with that?  I was informed by the server that they do have New York steak even if it was not in the menu but I don't care much for New York steak.  I wanted porterhouse, TBone or other great cuts.  There's no exotic meats like venison's or bison's cuts here either.  There's also no house special cut or house seasoned steak like some upscale steakhouses.  I guess I expected more considering the price range...   I did ask the server why their menu was so limited, he informed me that they actually have more but just not in the menu at that time. He informed me that this is to make room for New years special - The 3-5 courses meal special.  It's was written on the right hand side of the menu.  Maybe they need to have a 2-3 pages menu instead?  I'm guessing this will change after the holiday.  - Very simple and ordinary dessert menu. Although, I did enjoy their creme brulee, the cheesecake and the bittersweet lava cake was mediocre at best.  Again, if I'm  paying this much, I have higher expectations.    BOTTOM LINE:  A high 3's or 4 stars overall.  This restaurant is a great experience.  No regrets on my part.  Will I come back here again?  Yes but there is soooooo many interesting, competitive and amazing restaurants in Las Vegas that I want to TRY first.  In the meantime, this steakhouse is a one-timer (or two) in my book, FOR NOW anyways.",

For each pair we split a steak entree, go for the rib eye. MUST order the Truffle MacnCheese, it's heaven. You can order many other sides and there is a variety of salads and starters.

    "text": "This is a nice little steakhouse inside the Renaissance Hotel off the strip but being a steakhouse and inside a hotel, be aware that it is pricey (prices are akin to Morton's etc).  Luckily I knew that they offered $25 gift certificates at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> as long as you spend $50 which is not hard considering that the steaks alone are $45 (sides are about $9).  When I arrived I had to make my presence known to the hostess as her back was turned to me while she was busy reading something.  Having been full from a happy hour splurge (at Morton's ironically) a couple of hours earlier, I only ordered the Fillet Mignon and no sides (the steaks come with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables that are served \"family-style\").  I wasn't offered a choice of sauces (per the menu) or told anything about the salt choices but I think that was because I was dining alone and the server didn't want to waste her time with a \"small\" check (the restaurant was nearly empty with only 5 tables when I was there).  The Fillet at 10 oz was done correctly (ordered at Medium) and very flavorful----it came with a demi-glaze sauce which I guess is the default (and quite tasty too).  The mashed potatoes were creamy and the vegetables decent but as I'm not a mushroom fan I didn't eat much of them.  The steak was enough for me considering my lack of appetite but I think it would have been enough either way as the portion sizes for the steaks are quite large.  I also tried the dessert of the day, a pineapple upside down cake with a sorbet at $9.  It is a very small portion so if you were thinking about sharing you might want to think again or go somewhere else for dessert (try the cafe at the Palazzo).  It was very moist and delicious but overpowered with candied ginger on the outside (probably would have been better inside the cake).    Service was fine especially the busperson who constantly filled my water glass and brought me bread.  They have an extensive wine list with a good but small selection of wines by the glass (from $10-20).  I believe you can also dine in the wine cellar if you have a large enough group.  All in all, this is a fine steakhouse but not on par with Morton's (better than Fleming's though) even though the prices are comparable.  If you're staying at the hotel and don't want to venture out, this is a fine choice but if you're craving a good steak with the fine steakhouse service I'd go down about a mile south to Morton's.  In the end, I walked away not sure that it was worth the $50 (even after using the gift certificate) for a steak, dessert and glass of wine.",

It's something like a 2 hundred dollar meal.  Well, it was like that here.  I cracked up when they brought out my food!  I ordered the 8oz Fillet Mignon and potato fingers.  They brought the steak out and it was on this huge plate.  On it was a tiny 8oz steak, a baby carrot, and 2 asparagus stalks.  Haha!  Just like in that Mastercard commercial.  The potatoes were served on a separate plate.    Well after having a good chuckle I cut into it.  Wow!  First, lemme say that I ordered mine rare.  Most steak places will not cook it less than medium.  I cut into mine and it was perfect.  You couldn't get anymore perfect than the ruby redness of this steak.  It wasn't just my steak either.  Everyone's steak was cooked perfect as per their order.  It was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  No kidding!  I'm from Texas.  Beef country.  We know steak.  The potatoes were good too.  A friend of mine had the truffle fries and wow that was tasty.    The atmosphere was nice.  It wasn't noisy or crowded like the strip.  The staff was great and on point.  Helpful with the menu and our questions.  Despite the small amount of food for the price I'd have to say that when you come here you pay for the quality not the quantity.  It's a good thing too cause, hey, you're in Vegas!  You need to make room for the booze!  Oh yeah we brought our own wine.  Corkage fee was $25.  Pretty nominal for most places.  Grade \"A\" service and food.",

    "text": "We decided to celebrate our first year anniversary here after getting a great coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> and reading the other reviews here on yelp. having the menu with prices available online helped us a lot on deciding which coupon amount to get since there stipulations on it, for example pay $30 for a $75 gift certificate but spend a minimum of $150 not including alcohol & an %18 gratuity charge and this is the deal I got, although I think we should have gotten the $50 deal because there was only two of us. Their portions are pretty big. My husband had the ribeye, I had the rosemary veal, and for sides we shared the truffle fries, cream corn & Mac & cheese. With these orders plus drinks we did not even reach our required minimum of $150 yet. The sides were good for 4-6 people each order. We both did not finish our main entrees & we hardly made a dent in the sides. Overall the food was pretty good & the portions generous, but what really made this place worth it was the service, the atmosphere & just the experience of it! Our server daunte was awesome, he bent over backwards for us to accommodate our various requests. As what other yelpers wrote, they brought us a complimentary champagne toast and a happy anniversary dessert , the manager also personally came over and delivered a hand written happy anniversary card to us and her & the chef personally greeted us happy anniversary...the added personal touch was just the cherry on top! The staff here at envy really do know how to make you feel special. I did hint though that we were celebrating our anniversary (wink, wink) so if you are wanting to celebrate a special event, this place is top on my list, nice place, great food, reasonable princess, awesome service, what more could you ask for? I know there are some negative comments, but this is my advice to you, YOU are responsible for making YOUR experience positive or negative, it is all about attitude, do not let the pessimists sway your decisions, am glad I didn't.",

    "text": "I feel awkward typing up this review because I thought for sure I'd be adding to the legions of 5 star reviews.  My boyfriend and I went to Envy Saturday night.  I really liked the decor.  I had the bone-in ribeye and the mac 'n cheese.  My boyfriend had the chicken.  After trying our respective dishes, we both came to the conclusion that there was something missing.  Admittedly, the ribeye was incredibly tender and the center part almost melted in my mouth.  I don't even know how to explain it other than to say it was bland.  I love mac 'n cheese but was disappointed by this one.  It tasted much too wine-y for me.  I don't like the taste of alcohol.  The workers were also a bit short with us.  I expected much better customer service.",

The server recommended the creamed corn, and any time anyone recommends something that strongly, I usually get it (even though I'm not a huge fan of creamed corn). It was amazing! Like a crisp, sweet taste of summer... Apparently they grill the corn in the husk, cut it off the cob, and cook it lightly in cream and whiskey with bacon. The spinach was great, the mac & cheese was amazing.   The service: unbelievable. We came at a time when there weren't many people, which helped, but I get the impression it would be great any time. Josh, our server, was so genuine and sweet and attentive - he spent time talking to us (but not in an obtrusive way), the Chef came over and talked to us both about the food and the Bears (we're from Chicago), and Marc (maybe the mixologist?) made us an amazing drink.   I can't say enough about this place. It a little far from the Strip, but it is *so* worth the cab ride.",

The sides we normally get are the creamed corn (fanstastic!) and the mac and cheese.  The truffle fries are amazing too.  I can't recommend this place enough.

Butternut squash soup was ahh-mazing but the price for a small bowl gets you what you pay for, it was pretty good.  The steak I don't think was worth the price, I've had better.  The atmosphere and furniture decor was top notch though, even the foyer/sitting area was very stunning - it made me wish the restaurant had a wait time - I would hang out there!",

We ordered the large seafood platter for the table and it was good the oysters were the only thing that didn't quite measure up a little fishy tasting.  Side dishes were very  good the shoestring potatoes and the sauteed spinach tops.  I was a little disappointed in the steaks we received the bone in ribeye was good but the portions seemed a little small. The bone in filet mignon which I had was more disappointing. The portion size was smaller than expected I asked for medium rare the steak was definitely medium the cut was not worth $45.",

Roomie went with the lamb chops and we shared a 1/2 pound of crab legs.  Both the lamb and the steak, perfectly cooked and rib-eye w/ melted blue cheese - ALL GOOD !  food downer - the asparagus were too skinny/ too dry. and i still think the bread bites !  Other downer - service was a tad slow - they comped us a dessert that i suffer watching my roomie wolf it down.  I like this place but i've got several other steak places to hit so it might be awhile before i return.",

    "text": "Fair warning: what follows is a rather lengthy story... ^_-  We were in Vegas to celebrate three different birthdays, and so we naturally had a large dinner party of 13.  Our plans were to enjoy an excellent dinner and then head over to the Mirage to watch Cirque's LOVE show.    I had originally made the reservation for 9, but ended up calling two more times to change the party number.  Every time I called, the hostess didn't have a problem with it.  On the last phone call, I even told her that we were celebrating multiple birthdays, and she said it was no problem, and to see tell her the birthday people when I got there.  I even asked if a reservation at 6:30 would be enough time for our 9:30 showing, and was told we had plenty of time for dinner.   The reservation was made for 6:30 PM on Saturday evening, and our entire of party of 13 showed up by 6:40 PM.  We weren't seated until 7:00, but we didn't mind since we were taking pictures and chit-chatting amongst ourselves in the waiting area.  During this time, the hostess was kind enough to point out our waiter to me so that I could let him know who the three birthdays were.  After we were seated, the waiter introduced himself, the menus, and the drink menu.  I slipped him a piece of paper with a diagram of our table, and indicated where the three people were seated.  He looked at it for a second, realized what it was, give me a smile and nod, and tucked it away.    Everyone in our party knew pretty quickly what we were going to order, so when asked for our drinks, we went ahead and put in our orders as well.  At around 7:30 PM though, we noticed a large crowd of people filing into a curtained off section.  We assumed it was a group affiliated with a convention of some sort, and guesstimated about 70 or so people to be there.  They were loud and having a good time, with lots of cheering and applause.  Our party had fun with it at first, cheering and clapping along.  But after the fifth time of a rousing chorus of cheers and claps, it did start to get old.  Nonetheless, the appetizers came (for those that ordered them), and we all got distracted by taking pictures and tasting the yummy concoctions.  The Maryland Jumbo Lump Crab Cake were truly jumbo shrimp (Yummy!), and the tomato soups and onion soups were cleaned to the last drop.  We noticed the time around 8:15 though, and we were wondering why we hadn't gotten our food yet.  Yes, we were a big party, but it had been a good 45 minutes since we had ordered.  We asked our waiter about it, and he said it should be done soon, and he'd check up on it.  8:30 came around, and still no sign of our food.  (We noticed our waiter was going in and out of the kitchen a good number of times - he was looking pretty concerned himself.)  Slowly, the conversation at the table turned to the fact that our food was still not here yet, and that we had to leave around 9 to get back to the Strip.  Finally at 8:40, our food came out and our waiter apologized for the wait, explaining that the kitchen had gotten backlogged due to the other large party.  Everyone at the table was a bit miffed - the restaurant knew well in advance that there were two large parties coming!  Between the 13 of us, we had gotten every cut of steak on the menu, the sea bass, and the veal chops.  We also ordered sides of mashed potatoes, truffle fries, mac and cheese, grilled asparagus, and creamed corn.  We all enjoyed what we order (and impressed with the size of the bone-in ribeye), and the sides were delicious.  (The mac and cheese, truffle fries, and creamed corn were devoured!)    Having said that we enjoyed the food, it was as much as you can enjoy scarfing down food within 20 minutes... We were very disappointed that we couldn't enjoy the food in a leisurely manner, but we all commented on how good the food was.  HOWEVER... not a single plate came with the sides that were included (mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.)  That was another big oversight of the kitchen that we weren't thrilled with.    As we rushed to settle the bill, the waiter came by to ask us what to do about the birthday people.  I was really sad to tell him that we unfortunately didn't have time - we had to get going to make the show. But in waiting for the taxis to arrive, our waiter surprised us and was able to get three desserts packaged in to go boxes!   In the taxi ride back to the strip, we commented on the quality of the food, and that it really was very unfortunate that we weren't able to have a proper experience at ENVY.  We all agree that while there was a definite lack of foresight from management  to be unable to juggle two large parties, we would definitely have to go back again to give ENVY a second chance with the amazing food that we had.",

    "text": "Great food and experience... my only big complaint was the price creep of what I saw online and when I got there.  I was swayed to this place because I like venturing to those off strip steakhouses that has same quality of food as higher priced places.  However when i got there the prices were a small bit higher than what I saw online and it wasnt much cheaper than places Ive been to onstrip. Bread was disappointing... unimaginative rolls (garlic,rosemary, sourdough... i think) with plain butter and they were hard. The chef's complimentary taste of ceviche was delicious.  I never had ceviche but I loved this.  Tried it at another place the day after and it was no where near as good.  The entrees... I got the sea bass which is really chilean sea bass (I was surprised they didnt make this difference more pronounced as sea bass is way different than chillean sea bass which is not really even sea bass).  I only asked on a whim and immediately ordered that because Ive been craving some for a long time.  I was not disappointed... Delicious!  I cleaned my plate of chilean sea bass that had a perfectly seared crust,  shitaki mushrooms, asparagus and other veggies with truffle oil.  Wife had the ribeye and it was very good to, comparable to any I had in Vegas.  The wild mushroom sauce for $4 extra was very likely the best custom steaksauce I have ever tried but that steak was juicy and flavorful enough to enjoy without any sauce. The truffle fries were awesome despite being shoe string fries which I'm not a fan of.  The housemade ketchup that tasted way better than anything you could buy in a store.  However they gave enough fries to feed 4-6 people easily.  They really should have half order options on the sides. I got the whiskey cream corn based off of recommendations.  The last time I had creamed corn was out the can as a kid but I'm glad I tried this.  It was delicious. It was a pity this place had very few people in there on a Saturday evening.  People are missing out",

I realized that the steaks may be as good as the reviewers said or perhaps there was an ample amount of reviews for this restaurant because they took advantage of the coupon offer.  I've tried many steak houses and I would say that is one is about average. Hence, the 3.5 stars.  If I didn't have the coupon, I would probably not come here.  I did try the creamed corn and truffle fries sides.  I expected more from the truffle fries, but they were still good.  There was too much fries to finish so I finished it 3am in my hotel room and tasted even better.  The creamed corn in my opinion tasted better.  Our waiter was professional and courteous.  Service was excellent.  The ambience of the restaurant was classy and upscale.

My friend's rib-eye, however, was cooked medium well to well when we ordered it medium.  The other food was passable but not exceptional.  I was one of two sophisticated diners among four.  Other steak places offer interesting sauces/reductions.  Maybe it's just me, but I would like a demi glace to have more depth of flavor other than just a reduction of juices and salt -- maybe some garlic, some red wine, a hint of balsalmic.  The bacon in the spinach salad seemed like it was in the pantry chef's \"mise en place\" for some time.  I would have liked the bacon cooked to order, hot and crispy, and tossed with the dressing at the last second and then served.  These are a few examples of the little things that differentiate slightly above-average from excellence.  When you're paying 12 bucks for a salad, don't you deserve it?  The decor of the resraurant reminded me of a high-end coffee shop, nothing too chic.  To summarize, excellent meat (if prepared as ordered), but the whole was disappointing compared to the some of its parts.",

We mentioned that an anniversary was being celebrated when we made our reservation and they started the evening right by serving us complimentary champange which was excellent.  Our friends both loved their spinach and caeser salads but we thought that we did better with the black pepper calamari and rock shrimp appetizer.  We were told that the calamari was marinated for 24 hours in buttermilk and it was the most tender calamari we've ever had.  Both the marinara and yuzu-mirin sauces that came with it were out of sight!  All of our steaks were done perfectly to order and the signature sauces that accompanied such were great.  The roasted veggies and garlic mashed potatoes that came with the steaks were very good but the bourbon creamed corn was just fantastic!

Good thing we had the coupon because I would have been majorly PO'd. As it was it wasn't worth what we did pay either. Steaks were nothing special, tough for the cut and cooking and not well seasoned. Online menu showed no lunch menu and had the ribeye for $45 but we were informed it was really $52 after we ordered and received all our appetizers (and ya, it would have mattered ). Maybe it was because we came during lunch? Different day chefs? Maybe because we had the coupon? It shouldn't matter as consistency is important in a quality establishment.  We use the coupons to explore and find favorite new places without feeling we've wasted too much in the process if we come across duds. Due to our experience today, neither of us have any interest in going back and we visit Vegas a lot ( total bill wasn't cheap either at just under $200).",

    "text": "After having read the scores of good reviews me and some friends decided to give Envy a try for my 30th birthday...unfortunately nothing special ensued.  The menu read like most steakhouse menus read...which isnt bad in-and-of-itself, however, if you are going to serve everything that every other steakhouse serves, it better be good.  It really was a disappointment that it fell short. The steaks were so very ho-hum.  The chicken cooked on the salt brick lacked any sort of ingenuity.  The rack of lamb, which I ordered, just did nothing to standout.  While it was cooked well (med-rare), it was largely bland and lacked that crispiness that lamb fat gets when it is cooked well.  All of this is not to say that anything was bad...it wasnt.  The server was excellent!  He had a very good grasp of the menu and was friendly and attentive to say the least.  Having eaten at some of the other premier steakhouses in Vegas I was expecting alot, unfortunately it seems as though the bar was set too high.",

I had the sea bass & he had the rack of lamb & they were both amazing. We had lobster Mac as a side & it was rich & delicious! We had the chocolate cake & cheesecake to top it off & they were both delicious as well. A must go to steakhouse when you visit Vegas!",

Service was wonderful. Truffle fries came out as a huge serving but were overcooked. French onion soup was not good to me at all. The bread was soggy and unappetizing and that's the way the dish is served since we got two of them. But 5 stars because if how good the lamb rack was.",

From the moment we got to the host desk, every employee wished us a happy anniversary, from the staff dropping off bread and even the staff just walking by! Very sweet and special. Our server was Christian and he was amazing!! Serious props to him. Very kind and attentive. I hope ENVY takes good care of him since he is certainly representing them well! The food was to die for. Steaks were perfect, truffle fries were a huge portion, and the desserts were so yummy. Possibly the best cheesecake we've ever had. They even treated us with \"Happy Anniversary\" on our dessert plate :) With delicious food and such an awesome staff, we highly recommend going to ENVY!",

It came with 2 appetizers up to ~$8 each, 1 side, 2 entrees up to ~$55 each, and a choice of 2 desserts. I got the lobster tomato bisque, calamari, mash potatoes, 2 filet mignons, chocolate cake, and NY cheese cake. I took away 2 stars because the filet mignons were extremely dry. I know I'm in the desert, but I asked for medium rare and I got steak that looked like it was chilling in the desert for days. How do you mess up steak and call yourself a steak restaurant? The saving grace had to be the mashed potatoes and the lobster bisque, the mashed potatoes were warm and buttery; and the bisque was tangy and delicious. Also, being a New Yorker I've had cheesecake from all over and the cheesecake that was served to me was gross. It was chunky and resembled more like moldy cheese than how actual cheese cake is suppose to be. I wouldn't return here, it doesn't seem like they get much business unless a convention is in town (as they're located inside a hotel).",

    "text": "My 5 star rating is for the dinner we had here. Breakfast is 3 stars because I'm feeling generous. Lol. We came in here Friday night, around 8pm. We were pretty much the only customers in here, except for maybe one or two other tables. We were staying at the Renaissance Hotel, which Envy is inside.    We had Major as our waiter. He was absolutely amazing. He answered all of our questions, paid special attention to our requests, and did a wonderful job. Since we were basically his only customers at that time, I kind of expected this, but he still exceeded my expectations. We asked about different kinds of bread, he gave us more of the kinds we liked or said good things about, and he paid attention to our requests.   I ordered the filet mignon with the four peppercorn sauce, with a caesar salad, and au gratin potatoes. My brother had the lobster bisque soup, added a lobster tail to my steak, and asparagus. My mother ordered the same steak I did, except she asked for a hard sear on both sides. So basically in simple terms, she told them to burn it well on both sides, but still be medium-rare in the middle. The chef did one hell of a job there! It was easy to tell which steak was which when they brought them out. The one that looked like a hockey puck on the outside was hers. The one with the pretty grill marks was mine. They did exactly what she asked for, and she loved it. High points there, as she's typically never happy with exactly how a chef does her steak.   My steak was perfect as well. It was one of the most gorgeous medium-rare fillets I've enjoyed in a long time. I tried my brother's lobster bisque. I didn't mind it. I'm not a fan of seafood, and I wasn't hating on this. My mother loves seafood and she hated the soup. My brother enjoyed it. So very mixed ratings on that one. Lol. Salad was great. Au gratin potatoes were good. Portion seemed huge on the potatoes, but that may simply be because I don't eat a lot of carbs. I loved the asparagus. I'm not a fan of asparagus overall and typically will avoid it. Here, it was incredible. I actually can't say enough good things about it. Tip: dip the asparagus in the four peppercorn sauce. It's amazing.   We had breakfast here all three days we were in the hotel. It was less than spectacular. The service was great, I had no complaints there. The food was like a continental breakfast, only with slightly more options. That was about the only difference. The last day we were there, Monday, there was no buffet. It was ordering off the menu. I personally thought the prices for breakfast were ridiculous, and the food wasn't really any different than the buffet thing for the weekend. It wasn't terrible, just less than impressive. That's all.   Would I return? Yes, I definitely would. I loved the dinner we had here, and breakfast was OK. Service was great, and it was enjoyable.   Review 76 of 2017.",

I didn't know what to expect because the Groupon didn't specify what the meal would consist of, but the Yelp reviews assured me it was good. It did not disappoint.  When I got to the restaurant they asked if I had a promotion or deal and I said I had the Groupon. (I made my reservation on OpenTable a day before). They gave me a special Groupon menu. It actually had a pretty good selection of food to choose from. I ordered the wedge salad, calamari, sirloin, and cheesecake. The food started flowing after I ordered. You get free bread as well. The service was on point and very attentive. The food from start to finish was good. Salad, yum. Calamari, on the spot. Steak, very well cooked. Cheesecake, a great ending to a good meal.  Overall, I had a fantastic experience. I don't know if I'd come back without the Groupon though. Let's face it... it's a pretty expensive steakhouse off of the strip. But, if you manage to snag a good deal or get the Groupon... I'd definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "This was one of those meals where each thing was amazing but then the next thing was somehow better than the last.   My friend and I came to Vegas for an X-ray convention, and she showed me this travelzoo deal. After reading the reviews and perusing the menu, I readily agreed. I started with the calamari and my friend with the lobster bisque. Both were perfection, calamari was cooked exactly right- it was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. There was a dipping sauce that was maybe ginger or something? I'm not sure but it was fantastic. The lobster bisque was excellent as well. I thought it couldn't get any better... and then my rack of lamb came out. I ordered it rare and it came out exactly right, and crusted in a salt/herb mixture that elevated delicious lamb into another world. Katie loved her filet too. And the au gratin potatoes were awesome too.   AND THEN DESSERT. I had a chocolate cake thing that was so rich and decadent that we couldn't finish it but we put forth a valiant effort. Katie had a cheesecake that was so rich and creamy and delicious that we did almost finish it.  And to top off that off, the service was excellent. Super friendly and attentive. I am thoroughly impressed. Will absolutely come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying the service was great however, the food was far from it. I was unfortunately greatly disappointed with my experience here food wise. This location does offer 1,000 bonus points for reservations booked through OpenTable, which is $10 worth of points.   The bread  and butter was fresh, warm, soft as was the butter. They gave us a complementary  salad that had capers,  tomatoes, hard boiled  eggs,  bacon, Parmesan cheese and either sardines or anchovies which kind of ruined it. It may have been healthy, although the fish  was very fishy tasting. So, if you're not a huge seafood fan you'll really dislike this salad. But you can't argue too much since it's free.   We ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon $49 & 24oz Porterhouse  $55 both medium rare. We both received them WELL DONE! Not even remotely close to pink in the middle. You'd figure for a place known to be a steakhouse wouldn't screw up that bad. Don't get me wrong I've been to my fair share of Steakhouses/Chophouses and received my steak medium after ordering it medium rare, which I won't send back. But over $100 to not enjoy we ordered . Not going to happen. I also ordered a side of Mac & Cheese $8.   Yes, of course I'm skeptical about sending any food back to the kitchen, especially after watching Waiting. The waitress was kind and sent it back to the kitchen. She got rid of our old Mac & Cheese so we can have a fresh back with the new steaks.   I don't mean to come off as a snob, but more of a aficionado, the Steaks are by no means worth the price despite the major hiccups. I've paid triple the price for half the size before, but it was worth. I'm a believer in you get what you pay for and unfortunately the steaks that I ordered weren't worth the price. And I always enjoy ordering a side of really good Mac & Cheese. This Mac & Cheese was way to creamy and super plane Jane. Not worth it. They did give us buttermilk mashed potatoes as a side as an apology. I am unbiased despite my poor experience with the food and can say that the mashed potatoes were like the kind I grew up eating as a kid out of the box. So, needless to say not fond memories.   They did hook it up with a large dessert platter. Best of which was the Chocolate Lava Cake. The others, I wasn't a fan of and would have been disappointed had I paid for it.   Service was great which is why I gave this restaurant 3 stars, otherwise would've been a solid 1 based on the food alone.",

Several different folks came by and filled our waters. The bread was very good. The Vegas Caesar was ok, my wife's had a full anchovy in hers. Did not know until then that some even came with that or if they're even supposed to, did not say on menu. Truffle fries were pretty good, never had them before so can't compare. The steaks were rather bland, I had bone in ribeye and my wife had filet. Both came with a house sauce which was good but if ya gotta have sauce for a $59 steak you've got a problem. Steaks were cooked correctly. Overall seems like just another place trying to emulate Ruth's Chris which in my opinion won't happen.",

    "text": "Several years ago I purchased a Groupon for Envy and promptly forgot about it. Recently I decided that I should visit and at least use what I paid for the Groupon. I'm so glad that I did! Our dinner was great.  Envy is inside The Renaissance which is also shockingly nicer than expected. The area around the hotel/restaurant isn't the greatest so I opted to valet my car. Valet was free for dining at the restaurant. Of course there is a tip, but the two valets I encountered were friendly and definitely deserving of a tip. Making a reservation through OpenTable was easy and I earned some points for the reservation.  The restaurant has mostly tables, but there are a few booths. On a Wednesday night the restaurant was about half full. The ambiance was nice. It was not quite as swanky as some other steakhouses, but still had a nice restaurant feel.  Our waiter took good care of us during our dinner. He did a good job of checking in and making sure we had everything we needed without intruding.   The menu had many of the steak and side offerings that are typical at steakhouses. Pricing seemed a little bit lower than prices on The Strip.   The bread basket with butter to start was fine, but not notable. My Filet Mignon was very good and prepared perfectly. The steak comes with a choice of sauce and I opted for Bordelaise. The waiter described it as a sort of mix between gravy and red wine sauce. That was the perfect description and it was delicious. I was torn about using the sauce because my steak was absolutely perfect without any sauce. My friend had the New York Strip steak. He also raved about his steak and the horseradish sauce on the side.   We shared Bourbon Cream Corn, Whipped Buttery Potato Puree, and Chili Garlic Broccolini as our sides. The favorite for both of us was the Bourbon Cream Corn. The potatoes were really good at first, but lost some of their whipped texture and buttery flavor on second and third serving. The broccolini was very good and definitely a delicious way to enjoy vegetables.   To finish off the meal we shared the Chocolate Lava Cake. This dessert was huge and much more dessert than expected. The lava cake was surrounded by a chocolate rice krispy ball and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate on top. The plate was garnished with plenty of chocolate as well. It was one of the most chocolate filled desserts I've ever had. The cake was delicious and very rich. I also enjoyed the rice krispy ball which was a lighter treat. The ice cream helped balance out the richness of all the chocolate.   An unexpectedly great option for a nice dinner without heading to The Strip. I imagine I'll be back here for another great dinner in the future.",

I dont remember what all of my friends ordered but I remember it taking a very long time for them to get our food to us and they all werent very happy with the way their meat was done. Either overcooked or undercooked.   I had the lamb. My lamb was RAW RAW RAW. It was pretty much still alive. I had them re-do it and when they came out with it for the second time, the waiter placed it on my table and asked me to cut to make sure I was content. He hovered over me the whole time, watching me with the rest of the wait team behind him. What was that?   Anywhoo. Their fries are delicious but I am not taking a taxi off strip just for that...and I'm definitely not coming back for meat that you could still hear. Especially for $50+",

Made a reservation the same day and I asked the lady who took the reservation if she can personalize the menu for him and have his name on it ( something I saw on a previous review). She told me she can work on it but the reservation was last minute, and she'll do her best. I wasn't expecting anything but it was nice of her to try.   To my surprise when we got there they had the personalized menu greeting him happy birthday.   Our server was very pleasant and gave us some great suggestions on the wine. We got a nice bottle of cabernet. We ordered the calamari and rock shrimp for appetizer. We got the 40 oz Tomahawk ribeye and garlic mash potatoes.   The appetizer was ok, more salty than I would like and the shrimp tasted weird. The steak was delicious, it had that nice grill taste and a demiglaze that was not too overwhelming for the steak. It was a very big portion that we had left overs. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good.   As a bonus they brought us out a toffee dessert thing for his birthday.   The service here is amazing. Starting with personalized menu, the dessert, and then they even gave him a card to wish a happy birthday.  It's off the strip located at the Renaissance. Very nice hotel. I highly recommend this place!!",

Then comes the entree. We ordered a bone in ribeye, medium rare. I always thought that medium rare steaks were supposed to be juicy and flavorful. This was neither. It was dry as if it was cooked well done. The flavor was nonexistent as well. It was by far the worst steak me or my girlfriend have ever had. The sea bass was ok in flavor but as dry as the breadcrumbs they put on top of it.  If I could give it zero stars, I would. It's hard to believe that this place has 4 stars",

    "text": "While Las Vegas is teaming with tons of steakhouses, a trip to Envy last weekend did not disappoint.  The food and the service are top notch; an attentive wait staff took care of every need without being overbearing.  Some of the highlights:  1) The filet mignon...perfectly cooked and it literally melted in my mouth. 2) The truffle fries...AMAZING!  One order is enough for an entire table to share; what's even better is that the waiter asked if we wanted more (a bottomless plate of deliciousness, for sure)! 3) The mac and cheese - the perfect side dish to the filet.  Cheesy, flavorful...heating up the leftovers made for a great lunch the following day.  I had just eaten at the Steakhouse two nights earlier...absolutely no comparison.  Congratulations, Envy!  You've won yourself a lifelong fan!",

They were doing a valentines day prix fixe menu with some very interesting options. My favorite was the foie gras ravioli. Wow.  My porterhouse was cooked PERFECTLY and the service was top shelf.  It gets a little pricy, but you should expect that if you want to try great restaurants.  The only downside is the markup on wine. $10 bottles are going for $65+?!?! Work on that and this would be a perfect steakhouse.  The downside to writing a review at 9:30pm? Now I'm going to dream about the ravioli... :/",

    "text": "A great experience for us, and here's why:   - ample wine selection (and a nicely laid-out, if not obligatory, tasting room)  - simple, elegant menu  - consistent food quality  - casual, but attentive, service  - a kitchen of culinary artisans  While reserving a table for early dining at Envy, we were certain we wanted three things - a leisurely meal, the chance to try new wines, and delicious comestibles.  Fortunately, we got what we wanted.  As others have noted, the truffle fries are amazing to share, and the portion really is as huge as they say. The four-cheese mac is surprisingly mild, but also a cacophony of flavor hints. Between us we shared the sea bass and a tightly-trimmed New York steak. The asparagus was perfectly steamed, the steak was properly grilled to medium (yum), and the panko-encrusted sea bass was only lightly dusted, ensuring the fresh filet was rightfully highlighted. Only request: More shiitake mushrooms!  Pacing was perfect, and the amuse-bouche of garlic shrimp was a pleasant filler during our course prep. We opted for a couple of ONEHOPE wines - a cab and a zin - both contribute 1/2 their profits to a worthy cause.  Made drinking feel charitable! Honorable mention: The bread basket of freshly-baked rolls. You can just tell these were lovingly crafted. For dessert, their (also freshly-baked) bread pudding was a moist, fluffy delight of flavors to offset a cold night.   George (F&B manager) made sure to check in with us to ensure the service provided by the energetic Christian was to our liking, and the food the kitchen prepared met our expectations.  Everyone in FOH/BOH worked well together, and the food was easily on-par with Vegas' upper-tier steakhouses.  Highly recommended, and we'll be back.",

The food is to die for. I always get the filet mignon and we isually go as a group and orderbthe truffle fries (best truffle fries...hands down) we have also ordered the sauteed mushrooms, truffle mashed potatos and mac n cheese....Truffle galore!!! ;)   Haven't been to Vegas in over a year so it kinda sucks but can't wait to go back to envy when I do.   They used to offer deals on groupon but don't think they do anymore :( Not that this will stop me from eating there.   Ohhhhhhh anddddd they have a great selection of wines we've ordered numerous times for my birthdat and bachelorette party.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, especially after the fantastic service we got from our server Nikki, but I feel like I have to give it 3 stars just to bring attention to how badly the steak needs improvement.  Lots of hits and misses here, the seafood platter was a hit, it came with fresh and succulent king crab legs, lobster (half), oysters, mussels, jumbo prawns, but the clams were overseasoned.  The truffle fries were also a hit, huge mound of fries perfectly deep fried and topped with truffle oil and parmesan cheese.    The steak was a the big miss.  We ordered the bone-in rib eye for $47.  Steak was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it had a piece of tendon running through a part of it, made it chewy.  Also too much fat.  It was not a top quality piece of meat of even marbling throughout.  And I actually like fat on my steak, just not big pieces of it in certain spots.  I've never paid that much for a piece of steak and had to cut fat and tendon off it.  Very disappointing.    The service again was the saving grace.  When I made the comments to our waitress Nikki, without any expectations, she offered to comp the steak.  I opted not to, because we were using a travelzoo deal (very good deal by the way), and that would require us to not use the deal this time, but since I'm doubtful that we'll come back...  So she offered to comp the desserts instead.  Thanks but unfortunately the chocolate cake and toffee pudding were underwhelming as well.",

Pros: - Great wine - Great sides - Large portions - Excellent service  Cons: - Way the hell away from everything. You have to take a $15 cab so that's $30 round trip added to the cost of your bill. Just a consideration. If you're not going to go somewhere based on $30, though, then you shouldn't be going there anyway.  It's more about the time for me. - We came here on a Saturday night at like 8PM and the place was empty. Not the vibe we were hoping for. - My ribeye which full retail would've been like $40 was not very good. Very thin cut.. felt like a steak you'd buy at the grocery store?",

We had ours split and it was still more than an enough to start our palates. I had the deal of the day which was a half of sea bass and a 6oz filet migon. Delicious is all I can say!! My girlfriend had the 12pz bone in filet and she killed the whole thang easily and loved every morsel of it. The bacon Brussels sprouts and lobster mac n cheese were average to me. Great garlic mashed potatoes. The cream corn was excellent. I definitely recommend you try it. Great cocktails. Bartender was definitely loving with the service if you know what I mean. Overall this place is a must try and we will definitely be coming back for more. If you can ask for Matthew, you definitely won't be disappointed with the service.",

It's no celebrity chef steakhouse on the Strip, but it's a nice place.  The space itself is small and nicely appointed. Nothing unique or standout about it, but it is a nice ambiance. And the service has always been great.  What I love best here is the filet mignon and truffle mac 'n' cheese. It's cheaper than the Strip places, but in a lot of ways just as good.

    "text": "I discovered the existence of Envy last summer when looking for a place to have dinner with a bunch of girlfriends during a convention.  We ended up at Craftsteak, so I didn't get to try Envy 'til our latest trip to LV this past December.  We were armed with one of those <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupons from that fantastic sale, so it was the only place we were interested in dining.  Envy is without a doubt one of those hidden gems.  It's a secret you want to keep to yourself so you can get a table whenever you like (walk in on a Saturday night, we did), but you know that more people need to know about it lest it go away.  So you find the people you love and trust who have never willingly eaten at an Applebee's and you urge them in the strongest words you can to get there and treat themselves.  The decor is lovely.  Not too busy, not too dull.  Full of warm, comforting textures and colors.  The service was brilliant.  Everyone we interacted with seemed eager and knowledgeable.  They were very pleased to see us happy.  The food is expertly done.  Very rich.  Bring a hollow leg, because you won't want to put your fork down.    My boyfriend and I shared the tomato soup and spinach salad to start.  The portions were moderate, but not so small considering the rest of the meal to come.  We each had a filet mignon - perfectly cooked with just salt and pepper and no extra seasonings or sauce.  The steak is really just a compliment to the super-rich and super-yummy sides.  We had the truffle mashed potatoes (yum!), the bacon and guyere mac&cheese (double-yum!), and the bourbon creamed corn (oh. my. god. and I don't even like creamed corn!).    Even though we thought we'd burst, we lingered long enough to order a couple of espressos and desserts.  I remember them being excellent as well, but the bottle of Jordan cab was affecting my memory by that point.  I cannot remember both of the desserts.  One was based on strawberry... I guess I just have to go back to find out what they could have been.  Darn!",

I detected a bit of pepper seasoning on the meat and the white cheddar cheese set the ensemble nicely.  The burger was accompanied by the standard lettuce, tomato and some vegetables I couldn't identify, but lacking a rabbit to feed this detritus to, I left it to the side where it belonged.  The shoestring fries were well-spiced and plentiful.  An excellent side order to a fine burger.  In addition, the Renaissance was generous enough to provide me with a $25 dining credit, so my meal was free.  Comped food always tastes better than paid food.",

This was our favorite dish with heirloom tomatoes and their balsamic vinegarette.  Next up, the seafood tower for 2.  Came with 2 King crab legs, 4 tiger prawns, 4 raw oysters, and 4 raw clams.  The entrees were truly UNexceptional.  I ordered the Pan Fried Chilean Sea Bass with crab on top which came with a mushy slimy pile of \"wild\" mushrooms.  Slightly undercooked and much too greasy for the Sea Bass.  My partner ordered the Rib Eye medium rare.  The outside was charred while the inside was rare-red.  In addition, there was a pool of oil in the middle of the steak.  We sent it back to get a second grilling since it was not medium rare.  The second round came back the same.  Sides included a garlic mashed potato and seasonal vegetables.  The potatos were good while the vegetables were mushy, charred, and came with sprigs of rosemary mixed in.  I ended up having to pick out the rosemary branches like fish bones as they were poking my mouth and unedible.  We also ordered the creamed corn side, which was surprisingly fresh.  All in all, not worth the price.  I'd say order the appetizers and sides, but stay away from the entrees.  In addition, service was pretty shoddy.  Our waiter kept disappearing.  I do however give props to the waiter's assistant.",

    "text": "Thought we would try a different steakhouse and was pleasantly surprised.  The service was outstanding as we had Joshua as our waiter.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and made several great recommendations.  We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary and given glasses of champaign and a card upon arrival.  There is no doubt Joshua loves working for ENVY and making sure his customers receive the best service.  The side dishes were very good and plentiful.  The steak was prepared exactly how I asked, but in comparison to other locations, I wish the steak was served hotter.  The steak was served room temperature..presentation should be as though the steak just got off the grill and served HOT.  Envy gets 5 stars because of their impeccable service as a team!",

    "text": "Great service...had the Bone in Rib Eye...asked for medium rare....but when it came out is was more pink...so if you like medium rare...ask for rare...ehehhehh.... Good streak...but the bone was much thicker like 1.25 inch and the other side of steak was  like 3/4 inch..not very thick or evenly slices...so that changed the cooking time of the steak too.  The steak was a bit blan...but they give you a dish of salts...which can be sprinkled  on the steak before eating it.....make sure u use it.  The sea bass was the best....so buttery and crispy on the outside...melted in your mouth when chewing it, great taste while sitting in a nice display of yellow and green mushroom sauce..so nice and creamy.  There are coupons you can use that cost 40 bucks that will take 100 bucks off ur bill...so use it when you go here....great savings for great price for food.",

For the entree I had the lamb, which was good, but my boyfriends filet mignon was even better.  Those two entrees came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies included.  On top of that we got the creamed corn and truffle fries.  This was a lot for the two of us.  We could have got away without truffle fries but we really wanted to try them. ;)",

They're quick too. Obviously there isn't many items to choose from when it's late at night, but it's still good. I had the turkey sandwich and salad. The bread was a little too hard, but the salad with their vinegrette was great!  When you go for breakfast, the service is great. Very attentive. They gave us a sample of their smoothie as well. It was pretty good, made only from mixed berries.   I've also been here to hang out at the patio and have some drinks and food. They're pretty attentive and always come by to make sure you're okay.",

The rib eye steak was like eating steak flavored butter.. it was perfectly matched with a selection of salts (alderwood smoked was the best).  OH the sides, you could write sonnets on the Bourbon creamed corn (not a dish I would ever order... now I wonder why I can't find it elsewhere). Believe the hype about the truffle fries, I have never EVER taken home fries in a doggy bag... until these fries.  Service was great, personable fast the waitress an her assistant were on EVERYTHING.  We didn't have to wait for refills or more bread or anything.  This made a great meal even better.  I would say that the bartender that served us a drink at the beginning really put me off.  It wasn't busy and his attitude seem to be that we were bothering him.  I was a resident of Las Vegas at the time and since have moved, but my next Vegas trip this will be a destination.",

First off, everything was way way too salty. It felt like they literally drenched everything in salt... so while the steak was fairly tender, the crabs came off easily from its shell, I felt like I was eating salt. The creamed corn was crunchy (not expected), the port mushroom was okay and the truffle fries was also salty.   I just think everything would've been great had everything was less salty. Save the salt please!   I did get the 75 off 150 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate and we did tip off the original amount.

There understandably wasn't as big a spread as those at the hotel buffets on the strip, but the food that they did have was pretty decent quality. Pretty damn decent I'd say.  The traditional breakfast foods. The eggs were very well done however the sausage was a bit tasteless.  The omlettes they were making to order seemed to be a big hit (decent wait for them).   The seafood was probably the worst part of the buffet. That's not to say it was bad. It just wasn't too great. They had oysters (great), crab legs (mediocre at best), and shrimp (slightly above-average).   The desserts I didn't have but my friend ate every single dessert she got - she made me take a picture of how clean her dessert plate was.   The best part of everything was the unlimited alcohol in the form of wine and champagne/mimosas.    The whole meal was accompanied by an old dude playing old American beats on a grand piano with something like 30 60+ year-olds clapping along and continuously toasting.    Overall, I'd definitely go back to Envy just for a cheap but good meal, especially if I want to get a headstart towards getting myself plastered.",

I craved the chocolate walnut bread but they were out so serving a different bread but as soon as they learned how disappointed I was they returned with the last few slices for me.  i was so thrilled.  It's that type of service that makes the difference when there are so many restaurants to choose from on the strip.  Also, don't miss out on the parmesan truffle fries.

    "text": "I would've never heard about Envy if restaurants. com wasn't doing the 80% off coupon specials for this place. I guess for the locals, this is one of their favorite steak houses off the strip. It is a bit aways from the strip on Paradise Ave. Fortunately I was driving, I manage to find the Renaissance hotel and this place.   The parking and walking from the car part definitely was an adventure. The restaurant was buried way in the corner of the lobby and the best part was there were no signs that tell us how to get there. I guess I got spoiled by all those other casinos on the strip. Would be nice if there was a post it note on side of a beam some where..but oh well.   I came here right when they opened up at 5pm for dinner service. We had a very friendly waiter that didn't give us the dirty look because we were planning on using the restaurants .com coupon. Since we didn't have a huge appetite, we decided to share off the prix-fixe menu. Apparently thats a huge no no and its designated for one person. So we ended up getting the Envy signature bone in steak and a side of 3 cheese mac and cheese.   The appetizer arrived close to 30-45 mins after our order. I wasn't too annoyed since I wasn't hungry, and we got time to conversate and enjoy the decor at this place. They also gave us some bread with butter to munch on while they were firing up the grills.   The steak finally came split in two, and they creatively added some decor to the plate for both of us. I thought that was nice on their part since we were sharing and that we each got our own dinner plates. The mac and cheese came in a bowl on its own. I would say for $10, it was a very small bowl. The steak tasted wonderful, and not over cooked since I ordered it done medium well. Meat is meat, its all up to how much you cook it and how the flavor is. I would give them an A+ on the steak. The mac and cheese on the other hand had this funky odor. Probably smelled like some wet socks after football. Not to mention that it was way too salty. I could barely chew on the mac and cheese without crunching on another granulate of salt. Someone went crazy with the shaker in the back.  Either ways, we only had to pay half the price with our restaurant's .com discount. Next time we will definitely go with a $50 off $100 coupon so we can get a bunch of leftovers for the suite.  I will definitely pay Envy another visit.",

Generally this combo would put me straight to bed, but on this particular night I rallied, and thank goodness I did!

So rich, it should have been dessert. My husband and I shared the bone-in filet while our partners in crime both had petite filets. The bone-in was ah-ma-zing. Juicy, perfectly cooked... I am drooling thinking about it. The creamed corn was a perfect side for this meal. We did wine, we did dessert, and we did espresso. We also did a $75 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> gift certificate and I made it through the meal without passing out.

Skipped the appetizers and had the 'signature' bone in rib eye that again was completely flavorless. It was cooked a perfect medium but there was no flavor, no great tenderness, nothing that stood out. I had it topped Oscar style which was nice and added the only flair.  My wife had the Sea Bass which was served over wild mushrooms and topped with Crab Victoria. The fish was perfect as were the mushrooms. The crab was seasoned with Thyme and Rosemary which was just awful and took away from the fish. She added the butter poached king crab which again was seasoned, this time with parsley which again took away from the clean flavor the the crab and while I have had butter poached lobster before, the crab did not taste like anything had been done other than boiling.   The only high point were the sides. We shared the Creamed corn and the bacon and Gruyere mashed potatoes. Both were perfect.  Service was very good as well but we will not be making a return trip.",

Or waiter, Joshua, could not have been more pleasant, helpful and just  genuinely nice.  The complimentary bread was delicious and warm and fresh.  We ordered the wedge salad and the Caesar salad - both very fresh and pretty.  There were three of us and one of our friends can't eat much and Joshua had no problem bringing and extra plate so she could share our salads.  My hubby ordered the ribeye and he said it was delicious!  I ordered the New York steak and again, my friend and I wanted to share.  We had a table discussion about how to cook it as I like mine more well done than hers.  Joshua solved the problem by suggesting the steak be cut in half and each cooked separately.  Brilliant!  We ordered the creamed corn - and it was fabulous!  Definitely a high lite.  The lobster mac and cheese was good too with chunks of lob.  All through the meal the service was excellent.  When we paid two credit cards were used to split the Bill.  Again no problem.  We then said our goodbyes to Joshua and spent 10 minutes using the hotel restroom and goofing around taking pictures in the hotel lobby which was gorgeous.  As we walked out the door, up pulled the valet with our car, right as we stepped outside.  We had not turned our valet ticket in.  It was perfectly orchestrated so our car was there as we stepped outside.  All we can imagine is that Joshua got our last names off our credit cards and arranged for the valet to get our car!  We were so amazed at the perfect timing and it made us feel special.  All in all a great experience.  This hotel and restaurant are right next to the convention center.  Joshua told us that when the conventions are in town - totally different atmosphere - and they are packed.  No convention = quiet restaurant and low priced room costs.  So check the LV convention calendar.  We might stay at this beautiful hotel in the future when there is no convention - we checked and the rate was $109.  Great restaurant and cool atmosphere.  And Joshua is the best!!!",

None of the sauces that came with the steaks tasted good. I'd rather use the salt they provided. The best item on our table was the cream corn. Generous portions on the steaks, but I prefer quality over quantity. Will not get a repeat visit from me.",

That's not to say this is budget fare; an average cut plus sides and a couple glasses of wine can set you back well over $100 per person. I've been to better, but this steakhouse's more casual-hip ambience and quick service deserves a try. Tip: look on TravelZoo or other websites for bargain coupons before making your reservation.",

During the time I was the they only played what I'd consider night club music.  It just didn't go with the decor of the restaurant which I felt was quite classy.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail as an appetizer.  This was extremely delicious and was accompanied with a nice avocado mousse.  For my main dish I had the bone-in rib eye steak which was extremely juicy and full of flavor.  It came with garlic mashed potatoes which could have used a little more garlic and been a little more creamier and brussel sprouts which were cooked to perfection and seasoned with the bacon...YUMMM.  We also ordered bourbon creamed corn which was cut right off the cob, and was quite tasty.  For dessert, I had their New York cheese cake.   This was not a good choice at all.  The graham cracker crust was as dry as the desert of Vegas, and the cheese cake itself didn't have much flavor and was also quite dry.  All in all, this was a very good experience.  I was blessed to have a coupon from Living Social ($40 for $80) that helped with the premium cost.  This would be a great place if they adjusted the music to the environment and addressed the issue with my dessert (desert).  Because of these elements I give this place 4 stars, but don't let that missing star stop you from going here...This place is excellent.",

Unfortunately there was only one left. You would think that a steakhouse wouldn't run out of steak, especially on a non busy night. The actual food itself was very tasty. The lobster mac and cheese was by far the best dish of the night. Not sure if it is worth it to go again.",

I made reservations for the Chefs table which gives you a great view of the chefs in action. We had some yummy appetizers and cocktails upstairs at the club lounge before heading to the restaurant.   I tried the 17 oz bone in rib eye which came with the garlic mashed potatoes and medley of roasted mixed veggies. The steak was cooked to perfection and was delicious. Garlic mashed potatoes also excellent - buttery and garlicky but not overbearing. The veggies were decent and complimented the meal. Envy offers three types of salts which go great on your steaks and sides. Envy offers a 14 oz bone in Fillet which i tasted and it was awesome too!   The staff here is friendly and the head chef even introduced himself. He also took the time to follow up and make sure we were totally happy!",

I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and followed all of the rules of the Groupon, including calling weeks in advance and making a reservation and mentioning my Groupon.  When I showed up with my date on the evening of my reservation, the restaurant manager and the hotel manager both refused to honor my Groupon, and stated that they just weren't honoring Groupons anymore.  This was on January 7, 2017 and my Groupon had an expiration date of April 12, 2017.  They acknowledged that I had made a reservation and that they had it in their system, and that I had mentioned my Groupon when I made the reservation.  They first said that they would not honor the Groupon because there was a convention in Las Vegas that weekend, and they don't honor Groupons when there is a convention in town.  I pointed out that the date was not excluded anywhere in the fine print on the Groupon.  Then they said they just were not honoring Groupons at all anymore.  When I politely pointed out that they had no right to refuse to honor my Groupon, and that they had taken my money when I bought the Groupon and owed me the \"5-Course Gourmet Tasting Dinner for 2 People\" that I had purchased, they flatly refused to honor it and they actually called security and made my date and me leave the hotel.  They did not provide me with a refund of the money I had paid for the meal.  I can't imagine a worse experience, and I will never go to this restaurant or to any Renaissance Hotel ever again.  They rip off their customers and take their money selling a voucher and then refuse to honor it.  The worst kind of business.",

Chef Carlos actually came out and greeted us after we complemented him on his fine cooking skill and we promised to come back when we are in town.  Our server was excellent and super attentitve.  What the difference a year made!  Fast forward to 2016 New Year Eve, we braved the hectic 5:00p traffic and drove from Red Rock Casino to Envy Steakhouse, AFTER the receptionist confirmed our reservation and ASSURED us our Groupon would be honored.  We specifically asked about the Groupon clarification because it did not list any restrictions for holidays use.   And we could have gone to Fleming's Steakhouse on Charleston which is only a few blocks away from the casino.   Such a big disaapointment and a sense of betrayal when the manager at Envy Steakhouse said he was sorry that they had made a mistake and then just walked away.  Obviously we did not dine at the restaurant.  We contacted Groupon immediately to cancel our purchase and the full amount was refunded promptly on the spot since we dont want to have anything to do with Envy Steakhouse anymore.  Groupon also cannot find any listed restrictions or limitations in their record for their Envy Steakhouse promotional agreement.  I am just so happy my last bad restaurant experience ended on the new year's event  !!",

We got the chocolate cake w vanilla ice cream & cheescake w fresh berries and berry sauce-it was very soft and tasty-couldn't finish it. Overall with our server \"Josh\" at the helm, we had a very pleasant and delicious dinner. Made the freckles downtown LV from Summerlin so that says a lot lol. I'm a local and he told me about the Chef trying out new items sometimes so hope to come back for that. Don't forget to tip on the prove of device was amazing. I usually aim for 20%. Excellent service & team work by the floor staff so is go back in the future.",

It's a corporate hotel looking nice restaurant.  Nothing super special.  If you go only go with coupon.   One thing that was upsetting was you pay for parking at a hotel way off the strip.  Whatever.   I ate for well over half off regular prices and even at that I think it was just a fair price.     I will say my wife had the sea bass which she eats regularly and said it was thick and done perfectly.  The best she has had in Vegas.   So if you like fish that wouldn't be a bad option.",

    "text": "We loved this place. For being inside the Renaissance hotel, (not saying anything bad about the place- but definitely not a Vegas top favorite of hotels), we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of the food and service.   There are a lot more pros than cons. Everything we ordered (bourbon creamed corn, asparagus, calamari/rock shrimp, crab cakes, porterhouse steak, Chilean sea bass, chocolate cake, and two cocktails) was delicious. Our server David was attentive and gave good recommendations. The restaurant itself is pretty nice with classy and clean decor. We highly recommend the crab cakes, calamari, and bourbon creamed corn. Although my sea bass was amazing. The portions were perfect.   For the cons... they aren't too bad at all but worth mentioning. The bread they serve in the beginning came our pretty hard and cold (reviewers stated theirs being hot and soft), our \"calamari and rock shrimp\" appetizer came with no shrimp, my boyfriends steak was pretty tough to eat towards the middle (but the rest of it was great), the restaurant itself is really cold (maybe just the time we went), and although they do have a full bar- there was no cocktail menu. I feel like most restaurants in Vegas (especially steakhouses) have a specialty drink menu. I wanted to order a carajillo but their espresso machine was broken- so I ordered a plain vodka soda.   The prices are very reasonable. We used a nice Groupon for this meal. We calculated the prices and our total for two entrees, two appetizers, two sides, two cocktails, and one dessert would've been about $175 before tax. Not bad at all   Still happy with this place overall... but the little things jus brought it down to 4 stars rather than 5.",

We ordered the French onion soup, pan seared jumbo lump crab cake, filet mignon, Chilean sea bass (which my boyfriend won't stop talking about), and garlic broccolini, all of which we were quite happy with. The real treat, however, were the truffle fries. They were beyond delicious, and I've NEVER seen such a generous serving at a higher-end restaurant. Our only minor complaints about the food (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) were that the $free bread they brought to the table didn't seem fresh at all, their Bearnaise sauce was a touch too acidic, and the French onion soup wasn't the most spectacular I've had.   The service was impeccable-- everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive. We told our server we were celebrating my boyfriend's work promotion, and he comped the extra cocktail and side we had added to the bill on top of the Groupon!  All-in-all, I'd say this restaurant is worth the price, with or without a Groupon--we've eaten at considerably more expensive steakhouses that were not as enjoyable as this one. We will definitely be returning!",

We decided to try it out again for a special occasion but the entire evening was ruined.   Prior to arriving we noticed that there was a Travelzoo deal saving a little bit of money so we decided on purchasing it. We arrived to the restaurant for our 645pm reservation and were seated within minutes. It took a little while for the waiter to come out but when he did he explained the menu and we ordered.   For appetizers we got the lobster bisque and caesar salad. It took about thirty minutes for them to come out. The lobster bisque was very flavorless and not even warm. Then came time for waiting...and more waiting...and even more waiting. After another forty minutes we notified the server that we had a show to catch and that we would need the deserts to go. He said he would check on the food.   Our two filet mignons came out about another ten minutes after he went to check on them. One was cooled great, the other not so much. It was not medium rare not was it even warm! I was served a room temperature steak that I'm assuming was just sitting out waiting to be served. We tried to get the waiter's attention but he was no where to be found as was most of the night.  Once again we waited...then waited some more. Eventually we told a different server to just take everything away and in form our server. A few minutes later our server came out and said he could make me a fish pretty fast since the steak wasn't cooked right. I explained once again to him that we had a show to catch so he said he would bring the bill.  Next the manager came out and told us the bill would be taken care of. We explained to him that we paid for the voucher and they decided to already redeem it so its not like he was doing us any favor. He then asked if he could cover some drinks on our way out or take down our info for next time. As we are moving out of the country in a few days that has no use to us nor did we want to take time to order drinks while we were running late to a show.  Overall horrible experience and their service has definitely downgraded over the years. We wasted our time and money, and worst of all still left hungry after eating just a soup.",

The steaks had NO FLAVOR and they were DRY. I order my steak RARE and even that was a sad excuse for human grade food.  4. We had to ask for the check several times and even the Manager was a ghost the entire night.  5. The WORST service I have EVER had!  There is so much more I can write but just the thought of this restaurant is making me upset and lose my appetite.   Please EVERYONE looking for a quality restaurant DO NOT choose this one!

I also have a food allergy which the server MAJOR and the chef were very helpful and accommodating with changing the entrees into something for myself. I got the shrimp cocktail, Sea bass and asparagus  the cocktail sauce had wasabi in it which gave it an excellent zest. And the shrimps were HUGE. My fiance got the crab cakes, filet mignon, and cheesecake. The filet mignon is the best he's ever had! If you live close by or are visiting this is a great spot.

We made reservations but our show got out sooner so we headed over and arrived about 20 minutes early and they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time.  The food was amazing but I felt like the waiter didn't pay much mind to us and even more so because we were using a Groupon. After we paid our bill and the waiter brought back our card he actually talked to us a little and when we told him we were locals he gave us his card and apologized for not being more available and we should come back and see him. I don't think we will be returning.",

We were all starving from all the partying that we had done that day.    The decor of the place was very nice and was somewhere you could take a date on.  The wine list was decent and wine prices were fairly decent.  We ordered Calamari for appetizer which was nothing special.  The green sauce that was served with the calamari was very interesting.  Not sure if it was in a good way or not.  Then came the steak!  We ordered 6 Bone In Ribeyes along with garlic mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese.  The ribeye was cooked rare with some parts that looked completely raw (I had ordered it medium rare).  The beef was very tender and veryyy juicy.  Me and my friends all agreed that about half way through it, it was seasoned VERY salty.  Half of us couldn't finish the steak because of the saltiness.  The mash potatoes weren't much to rave about but the lobster mac & cheese was pretty special.    Overall the meal was okay... If it wasn't for my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, I would have been severely disappointing.

The beef cheeks made us nervous, but turned out to be excellent.  Very rich.  The sea bass was average (Bonefish's is better!) the filet was good as well, although the bearnaise was ice cold when we were served, and by the time some lukewarm bearnaise came, my steak had lost all warmth.  (And PS - I know that you can't make bearnaise too hot!)  The crab victoria I don't remember because I was on my third glass of wine :-)  Also, enjoyed a mix-and-match flight of wine for $12.  The service was shotty, which is why I gave it a 4 out of 5.  ENVY was a good experience all-in-all.",

Not only was the food amazing but the service was above and beyond what I was hoping for. Our server, Alaina, could not have been better. She answered all of our questions with such knowledge and detail we were blown away. She was also very personable and just overall really great.   I got the crab cake to start which was very good but could have been bigger. (Isn't that always the way..) My friend got the caesar salad which was huge and very tasty. We both ordered the black angus filet mignon and it was out of this world!! I was so full halfway through but couldn't stop eating it. The only thing I didn't like was that the outside had some of that char stuff on it, but it wasn't too bad. We also ordered the trio tasting of mashed potatoes which included garlic, bacon and Gruyere, and truffle. All three were excellent and definitely enough for 2 people to share. With that we ordered the asparagus with hollandaise sauce which was delicious. That came with enough for probably 4 people to share...   I got the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate before going. $75 off a $150 min purchase for $30. The only thing is you have to order those ones at the beginning of the month because they tend to sell out early....  I really enjoyed my visit to Envy. I am definitely going back to Vegas and I will be sure to go here again and again.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas for our anniversary for 5 days; 4 days at the Wynn Encore and 1 at the Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel where ENVY is located our last day. We both love steak, so we thought that ENVY would be a perfect restaurant to conclude our stay in Vegas. Unfortunately, ENVY did not live up to its ratings. Our waiter approached our table with a friendly manner, however, when I asked if they had a nice Malbec wine, he just thrust the \"wine by the glass\" menu towards me. Unfortunately, no Malbec, but this was no problem because they had a nice Merlot from the California central coast that I hadn't tried and was very good. The \"special\" for the evening  was a \"20 oz porterhouse steak with seasonal vegetables\".   Since my husband and I usually split a porterhouse (the filet for me, the surloin to my hubby), we ordered it. The waiter became a bit huffy when we didn't order an appeizer or salad, but a big steak and veggies would ordinarily be enough for the two of us. The waiter haughtl  manner lectured us on how the chef would not cut the steak and serve it on two plates; well, I hope not because all the wonderful juices will spill out. I asked for two plates. While the dinner was being prepared, the waiter came to our table with a bread basket; but went on and on about the special chocolate and nut bread that was included. The bread offered was not anything special except perhaps for the tinny sprig of fresh rosemary in the butter, a nice touch. The waiter returned with 3 types of salt and went on about how special they were; I'm not a big salt user, but my husband seemed to be impressed with the one that had a smoke flavor.  When our dinner arrived at our table, we were, to say the least, disappointed by the size of the steak. At most, it was maybe 14 oz; perhaps it was 20 oz before they trimmed it (it was a 28-day aged steak), but it wasn't as presented to us before we ordered. The veggies were good: not strong garlic mashed potatoes and a medley of potato, beet, and carrots, but all total about 1 cup of veggies. I did like the consistent rosemary herb flavor throughout the meal, but the portion size (although it was enough for a light meal) was not as presented before ordering.  We didn't order desert. Our waiter didn't even acknowledge us as we paid the bill and walked out although the other assistant servers were really nice as was the hostess.  I would not recommend this restaurant. It is overpriced and overly pretentious. Our bill was well over $100 for one meal and two drinks; our very nice hotel room and excellent service at the Renneisance was less than the meal. We left a 20% gratuity that hopefully went to people other than the snooty waiter. It was not the highlight of our anniversay stay in Las Vegas.",

Not to mention the all-you-can-drink champagne, mimosas and make-your-own bloody marys! The downsides were 1) the service was \"sporadic\" as another reviewer put it, and our dishes weren't cleared very often.  We ended up eating dessert amidst dirty dishes from our meal.  And 2) the food in the silver servers (potatoes, french toast, pancakes) was cold.  The sausage and bacon were under heat lamps, but were lukewarm.   And we were one of the first people seated!  I was expecting nice hot food.   However, the food was sooo yummy we will definately be going back!

    "text": "After much research I chose Envy for my husband and I to dine at on the only night we had free while I was on a business retreat. First the hostess got my husbands name wrong, no big deal, but when he corrected her she says, \"Whatever, it doesn't matter\"! We overlooked that as she was young and inexperienced. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu items, but I felt a slight chill from him when we did not order cocktails or wine. We don't drink alcohol, enough said about that. We started with the tuna and crabmeat dynamite, which was delicious, but at $17 was miniscule and overpriced. There was a tiny bit of caviar on top, but not enough to justify the price. It was nicely presented. I ordered the bone-in filet mignon and my husband ordered the bone-in ribeye. Both were cooked perfectly, but I doubt the filet was 16 ounces with bone as indicated. For $49 I expected more than I got. Sad. The server, I felt, should have told us that the sides were enough for at least 2 people as we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes (good while hot but bad when not), the asparagus (so-so), the truffle french fries (tasty but enough to feed 6 people), and the creamed corn, which we both thought the best thing on the menu. Needless to say we could not finish any of the sides, in fact we hardly put a dent in them. I felt like the server was upselling by not telling us the portion size because we didn't order wine. I've been a server so I know about upselling, but at least I was honest with my customers! Our bill came to $185, with dessert, which was unremarkable. Overall, we were disappointed with our experience there. Too bad, because it is a beautiful, romantic setting. Most reviews I've read were 5 stars, but I can't justify it here.",

Thank you Envy for making the BF's birthday memorable. From making the reservation to our waiter running after us with a forgotten item, Envy goes the extra mile. The friendly hostess asked if this was a special occasion when I called to make the reservation, and since the BF was right there, I had to be coy.  The hostess immediately took the cue, and did all the talking, telling me that she would make sure we had a special table, and desert on the house.  I confirmed the reservation the following day, and was greeted by name...she recognized my voice, and remembered that I wasn't able to talk.  When I told her that it was the BF's birthday, she said that the desert would have a BD candle..nice touch. The restaurant itself is comfortable.  Steakhouse dark. Service was perfect.  Attentive, but not stiffling Our waiter was so down to earth, unlike any other in Vegas.   He actually steered me towards a wine which was cheaper, and better than it's more expensive counterpart.   The funny thing is that at lunch the next day, the waitress at Capital Grille made me feel like I was ordering Ripple when I ordered it, and of course tried to steer me towards a $23 glass vs the $13 glass...but that's a whole other story and review.   So, back to Envy. Starters was the Fois Gras.  Perfect.  Rich. Decadent. Dinner :  Bone In Rib Eye for the BF-- Huge, Perfectly Cooked Me:  Bone In Fillet --yes..bone in !!  1st time experience for me.  Made the Fillet even more yummy, since there was a bit of fat near the bone. Portions are huge there, so we didn't order a side or veggie. Oh, I can't forget the BF's BD desert.  We had several choices, but went for the NY Cheesecake. Wow !!! It was the lightest, fluffiest cheesecake I've ever had. All in all, a 5 star restaurant which was worth ever penny. A Must when in Vegas.",

Its off the strip but pretty close by cab, and it was less of an inconvinience that we thought it would be.  Its pricey but definately worth it.  I also recommend the creamed spinach side dish.  Great service as well.   Made me wish I spent more money on steaks and less losing at craps",

The waitress was very informative on the menu, made a great recommendation for a cocktail, and when they served our food they explained the dishes we ordered with detail which was unexpected but nice. We ordered the seafood platter for two, a grilled rib eye to share, grilled vegetables, and the truffle oil Parmesan fries which was served as a mountain of fries. These fries are so good and you receive a lot for your money. The manager of the restaurant even came by to our table to introduce himself and make sure we were enjoying our meal, which we thought was very nice.  They didn't know It was our anniversary but you would think that they did because the service was excellent and they really made our night special,  we had such a great time dining there, and would definitely go there again.",

Our server Stephanie was awesome, she took very good care of us. My son wanted pasta with marinara sauce...this does not exist on the menu but Stephanie made it happen. The chef whipped up a linguini pasta w/marinara sauce and a grilled chicken breast. It was perfect! All 4 adults decided on the :  Bone in ribeye (perfectly seasoned and cooked)  with the fas grois butter.  Sides (share-able size):  Lobster mac n cheese (good) Creamed spinach (good but more like sauteed spinach) Creamed corn (awesome! Made fresh off the cobb) Appetizer:  2 orders of Calamari & Shrimp (very good). The manager here (Maria) is wonderful! We will definitely be back and Envy is highly recommended by all of us =)",

Favorite part of our meal was the mound of Truffle Fries although it could've used more Truffle Oil. Bone in Filet Mignon, a massive portion, was cooked perfectly medium rare. Regular Filet Mignon on the other hand was overcooked and dry with no pink. Lobster Mac & Cheese felt overload with the Velveeta-ish cheese and no trace of lobster. Enjoyed the medley of sauteed mushrooms much more. Signature Sea Bass with Truffle Butter Crust, Shitake Mushrooms, and Asparagus was a very nice light meal, cooked perfectly. Sea Bass was moist, the crust was flavorful though it could've used a bit more Truffle oil as well. Overall, enjoyed the excellent service and certain aspects of our meal.",

My wife and I came to Envy Steakhouse at around 7:30pm and was greeted nicely by the gentleman at the hostess table. We were seated very quickly and ordered our wine and app.. The app. was expresso rub flank steak. Cooked medium rare and very tasty. Then onto the entree and sides. My wife ordered the U10 scallop special And I ordered the sea bass. The sides were truffle fries and  steamed asparagus with bearnaise sauce. Every bite that my wife and I had of the food was very memorable. I speak with a lot of passion because I am a chef. This restaurant will be my top 50 restaurant that I have eaten the USA. Great job Envy Steakhouse!!!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place more as I had heard some good things about it.  We had a gift certificate we won in a silent auction at a charity event last year.  Our server told us that Envy donates to stuff like that a lot, so points for Envy.  We made our reservation for a Sunday evening, and it was not crowded. Maybe 4 tables.  We sat in a high-backed booth, which gave you more privacy and a feeling you were isolated.  This was nice.  The wine list was average for the strip in similarly priced steakhouses, maybe a little above average.  Lots of choices, but you will pay for them to be sure.  To start, the wife had the BLT wedge salad.  This may be the best salad I've ever eaten.  The blue cheese they use was of the highest quality, as was the thick bacon.  And, they load the toppings on.  The dressing had a little pepper in it as well, which really increased the flavor.  Just a fantastic salad that was flawlessly executed.  My appetizer did not go as well.  I had the shrimp cocktail, which comes with 3 sauces.  This dish didn't work for us.  The shrimp are large, which was nice, but the sauces were either too sweet or not spicy enough (the cocktail).    To eat, my wife had the filet, and I had the bone-in ribeye.  Hers was fine, a perfect rare.  Mine on the other hand had gone from getting a nice char to burned in spots.  It was mostly medium rare, but I guess they had some flare ups on the grill because it was beyond charred in places.  Made enjoying difficult.  I also found the size and quality of the steak to not be worthy of the price, which was $52.    For sides, we had the 4 cheese mac and cheese and the famous whiskey creamed corn.  Both were $10, and both were quite a large serving.  4 people easily could share these appetizers.  The mac and cheese was the better of the two in my estimation.  If the sauce was a LITTLE thicker, it would have been a home run.  But, good cheese flavor, and not greasy or heavy.  The creamed corn was good, crisp corn with bite and a nice cream sauce.  I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, that's probably Del Frisco's, but it was a good steakhouse creamed corn.  Service was FANTASTIC.  Knowledgeable server and our water/wine glasses were never close to empty.  Very friendly, but didn't hover.",

There wasn't room so I walked back over to the host stand when someone finally came over and seated me. My server did not smile and extend the same hospitality that the rest of the restaurant and hotel seem to emanate. He did have professionalism, but was missing the hospitality aspect that focuses on how you make people feel. I felt the same about the server assistant who I could barely understand.   The Caesar salad was very tasty, but the Caprese appetizer had mealy tomatoes and lacked flavor or seasoning. The Steak appetizer was grisly and just not a quality cut. The server stopped by but each time I could barely understand what he said through his clenched teeth. When I asked for the rest of my food to go his assistant boxed two separate dishes together in one huge box and left out half of the bread I had also requested to go. I am a foodie but also hate to waste food and thought I might be hungry enough to finish eating when I got back to my room. I called and let the manager know about the food being boxed together improperly because it was so unappealing! He very graciously apologised and agree that should not have happened and insisted on assigning a $25 food credit to my room. So although my experience was not the best, it was made up for with a room service breakfast the next day in its place, due to excellent management.",

The waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu and all the dishes.  However, one shortfall was that their so-called sommelier suggested a wine that was much cheaper than the one we originally picked out.  Since our group was on vacation, we wanted to spend money.  Wine was only a fraction of our meal and the rest of it spoke for itself.  Many in the group ordered the filet mignon while I ordered the surf and turf.  Cooked to near perfection complimented by truffle fries and a bland mac n' cheese.  By the end of the night, we were stuffed and super happy.  Simply a great experience and will look forward to coming back next time!",

In fact, that's how we found the place. We wanted to find a new place and looked at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for restaurants for our Vegas trip.  This place had great reviews, so we picked it. Our experience was so wonderful the first time last year that we went back this year again.  I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The decor, the lighting, in other words, your first impression is already up for a good start. Everything is beautiful, warm and subtle, including the menus.   Their wine list is simply amazing! They have all varietals you'd like for every budget. Josh is very knowledgeable about wine and has great recommendations. He even let us taste a couple selections by the glass as we were hesitant what to get.  He gets good reviews here and I can vouch for that. He's very professional, yet friendly and funny, amazingly helpful and simply charming.   The first time, after we decided what we wanted to eat, I noticed that at the bottom of the menu they were offering a 3-course tasting menu for a discounted price and it had exactly what we wanted. I can't remember what exactly they were, but I know I had the sae bass and my roommate had the steak and everything was just wonderful.  This time last month, we had the oven roasted, stuffed tomato. My roommate doesn't like tomatoes, but I ordered it for myself and we still shared it and he loved it. In fact, after dinner he said that the stuffed tomato was probably the best dish that night.  Since I don't eat red meat, I ordered the sea bass again, but it never disappoints. It's always perfect, tenderly juicy yet flaky, just wonderful. The shiitake mushroom and asparagus garnish is also very flavorfully prepared. I had the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc with my fish.   My roommate had the 10 oz. Filet Mignon and he loved it. They 3 different salts they give you are all amazing. I just used it on my bread. But one of them (can't remember which) really goes well with the steak. He had a Syrah that he just loved.  You would think that the portions are not that great, but with a 3-course meal, you really get stuffed.  We ordered 2 desserts and they were also just mouthwateringly wonderful. I wish I could have ordered one of each of the desserts, but I couldn't have eaten them all,  but any desserts we had there was both time amazing.  I can't remember the names of the two ladies who helped Josh out, but they were also delightful.   As I said earlier, I can't praise this place enough. Both times, everything was top notch. The food, the wine, the service, everything. I can't understand why this place is not more crowded (we actually like this fact). :-)  Anyway, do yourself a favor. When you're in Vegas, try Envy. You will not regret it.",

The heirloom tomato appetizer was a hard green tomato and a flavorless  extra firm red tomato. it they are heirloom the were from the mattell family. The Caesar salad was nice, small but nice. The Shrimp cocktail had three colossal shrimp, extra firm. I me it was a tough cut. I guess I was not impressed, and three stars is generous, very generous. Each dish was photo perfect and for some that would be impressive. I think I did not have enough (read none) to drink as a precursor to dinner.  I guess I will just move along. Sorry ENVY.",

    "text": "I was really disappointed.   This was my Birthday dinner.   We used the Living Social Coupon. Went here because a friend had suggested it.  To each his own, I guess.    We had..  Caprese Salad. - Very bland tomatoes, in fact one was mushy and a bad texture.  There was No salt on the table, which killed this dish completely.  Shrimp Cocktail - Shrimp were pretty tasteless, and although they had some sauces, there was no where near enough sauce for the amount of shrimp  Tomato Soup - Was good, but acidic, it needed a cream to break the acidity.  Bone-in Rib Eye - Way too fatty and tough.    Garlic Mashed - Good, esp with the Veal DemiGlace  Lobster Mac and Cheese - Good, very fishy flavor, if you like that.  it was  ok to me.  I have had This in other restaurants where it was not \"lobster\" enough.   This was not the case here.  The experience:  First, a different waiter than ours was retrieving plates near our table and dropped a plate on the floor, right next to us, glass shattered everywhere.  Hitting mine and my wife's bare feet and legs (We had Sandals on) The waiter didn't ask if we were ok, didn't apologize, he just acted as if nothing happened.  I was also worried that shards of glass maybe made it on our appetizer plates, because it was that explosive, but they did NOTHING about it.  My wife and I BOTH visibly checked our feet and legs and I had a knick on my leg from glass, the waiter saw us visually inspecting our feet and still said nothing.         Next, when I ordered the steak, Bone-in Rib eye,  I asked for Red Wine Reduction sauce and Herb Butter.  - When my steak was delivered, they forgot the Red Wine Reduction completely, and gave me what looked like Herb Butter, but chunkier.  Without testing it, I dolloped it on my steak and began spreading it, and noticed obvious Bleu Cheese chunks.  I tasted it and it was for SURE Blue Cheese, within the butter.   I did not order this of course, but I know Bleu Cheese for sure.   The waiter came back and I told him of the mistake, and he apologized, but also said they don't even have a Bleu cheese Butter, so he doesn't know how this happened.   He was good about it, but I did feel like they were calling me a bit of a lier as they mentioned a few times that they dont have Bleu cheese butter, and dont know that happened.   I cook... I know Blue cheese, AND, others on my table got the herb butter and it was completely different.     They did bring me a a new steak, BUT at that point I was eating after the rest of my party, and it was awkward.  To top it off, I was   Up to that point the best thing was the Red Wine Reduction, when they did bring it with my new steak.   Which is sad  They did bring a chocolate cake for my birthday and that was the star of the night for sure.     Too bad the actual food was no good.  The waiter was good and attentive, so I will give him kuddos for that.",

I was not blown away by the selection as the menu is quite limited (no steak tar tar, no oysters, no foie gras). Wine list and cocktail list is good. Stared with caesar salad and it was excellent, nothing I haven't had before but I really liked the way they prepare it here. The bread basket was nothing unusual, four pieces of white bread biscuits with a side of butter. Yawn. Nothing on the appetizer list made me want to order one, as the selection was a little boring (truffle fries, shrimp cocktail, sauteed mushrooms and french onion soup...seen it all before).   I choose the lamb which was perfect (two nice size shanks) and my gust has the mignon which was slightly dry, but still good enough. We chose to share a side of creamed corn with bourbon. It had a slight egg nog flavor which was surprising and I was on the fence at first, but I ended up enjoying it.   Also, the dessert selection was unimaginative. I had a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and a rice crispy ball on top. The cake was dry and Im sorry but I can get a rice crispy treat at Starbucks.  My guest had the carrot cake which was soft and delicious.  Overall a little too expensive and nothing out of the ordinary, but for a nice evening out you can do worse.",

    "text": "This review is only for the breakfast. We never had a chance to have dinner. Our group stayed at the Renaissance due to a expo at the convention center next door. We decided to have breakfast at Envy Sunday morning. BIG mistake, I know that Sunday was the start of the show but this was ridiculous. Here's a mental note, DO NOT GET THE EGGS at the breakfast buffet. They are runny and taste awful. The breakfast buffet was decent. Fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, eggs, muffins, bagels, and toast, yogurt, oatmeal (lumpy and awful), and pancakes. Looked a little more than a continental breakfast and expensive, thank God my boss had vouchers. The food wasn't the worst part of it, it was the service. Granted there are 8 of us but if you're going to provide crappy service don't charge us the tip. 3 breakfasts that were made to order from the menu came out to 75 bucks! The breakfasts took a long time to get to the table. We had to track down the waitress to get water or refills. She wasn't that friendly to begin with like she didn't want to be there in the first place and you could hardly understand her accent. Needless to say after that we had breakfast at the convention center or upstairs on the 15th floor were they had a continental breakfast. I don't know if I'll be coming back or if our group will. Maybe their more organized for dinner but at this point why try. BTW, the restaurant is hidden. It looks like it's just a bar area but if you walk around the curve you'll head right into the restaurant.",

    "text": "I don't think many restaurants are envious of this steakhouse's predicament. Vegas tourists worship new, shiny establishments; floundering businesses, like Envy the Steakhouse located in the Renaissance Hotel, end up offering discounts via deal sites to drum up interest. After our event at  nearby Las Vegas Convention Center, we walked into an empty Envy with a Groupon we had purchased just hours ago, the upside of which was attentive service.   We shared an heirloom tomato salad, served with, interestingly enough, yellow peach tomatoes, & a french onion soup which he called \"generic,\" meaning it could've come from any chain restaurant.   I'd give their sides alone 4 stars. The mountain of truffle fries were hard to stop eating & there were sections of shucked corn in the bourbon creamed corn.  He was pleased with his porterhouse, my filet was so dry, neither the peppercorn nor the horseradish sauce could salvage it.   Part of our deal was a dessert each. You'd think that would earn them an extra star in my book, but the cheesecake with berries & chocolate torte were both very middle-of-the road.   With so many choices in Sin City, I'd have a hard time choosing Envy again. (Next time I'm picking Lust or Gluttony.) ;-)",

    "text": "My wife and I are new to  the Las Vegas area. We have not yet developed our local \"Go To\" list of restaurants. It was also our 10th wedding anniversary. When the group-on came available (2 appetizers/2 drinks/1 side/2 entrees/2 desserts) I decided to check out Envy. It had fairly good reviews and we hadn't found \"THE\" restaurant yet, so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived at the hotel and used the valet ($10.00) for our vehicle. The valet was friendly and escorted us into the hotel to show us the restaurant. It had a classic/modern appearance and was about 70% full - on a Tuesday evening (7pm).  We were quickly seated at a table and introduced to out waiter for the evening. He quickly explained the group-on offer and the menu. Our order was quickly taken and drinks delivered.  We ordered two Lobster Bisques/Garlic Broccolini/Shrimp entree/Scallop entree/Cheesecake/Brownie cake w/ice cream.  The Lobster Bisque was made from a good tomato base and plenty pieces of lobster. Very tasty and enjoyable.  My wife had the Shrimp Entree. It was lightly toasted and moist. She enjoyed it immensely.  I had the scallops wrapped in bacon. It was flavorful and moist.  The Garlic Broccolini was almost inedible. The garlic was so strong that it emptied your sinus and burned your throat.  The desserts were okay.  The service was great, and the meals were enjoyable. The question was the value for your money? Was the atmosphere worth the elevated prices? No! Was the restaurant conducive for an intimate or personal dinner? No! (it was quite noisy the entire night that caused you to elevate your voice in order to be heard). Was the portions commensurate with the cost of the meal? No! ($38.00 for 4 scallops? Same for the shrimp).  We enjoyed the service and the food was good but not really worth the time/money. For our 10th anniversary, the only thing memorable was the company.",

ENVY is located inside of the Renaissance hotel which made me a little nervous because not all restaurants in chain hotels are created equal, but this one EXCEEDED my expectations.   Upon arrival we were promptly seated for our reservation in a tall booth that blocked the conversations of our neighbors. Our waiter Jacey (or J.C?) came over and explained the Groupon special to us which was extremely helpful. I started out with a perfectly made cosmo, calamari & shrimp, and the crab cakes. It was then that I realized that their SAUCES were top notch! The sauces served with the calamari were unique and delicious, and the chipotle aioli served with the crab cakes had the perfect flavor and hint of spice that paired well with the mango salsa!  For my entree I had an 8oz Filet and added Bearnaise sauce. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium and the Bearnaise was DELICIOUS! I also tasted the porterhouse which was extra juicy, and the peppercorn sauce which was even better than my Bearnaise!!!! Also the MOUNTAIN of TRUFFLE FRIES.... let's just say I hate half of them before even touching my steak!  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake with berries. The chocolate cake was extra sweet and chocolaty and tasted more like a mousse, but was still good if you like sweet, chocolate desserts. The cheesecake was rich and creamy, and the berries tasted fresh.  This experience was perfect from our awesome waiter, to the food, to the drinks, and the SAUCES!!! This restaurant will be on my list of places to visit in Vegas from now on!!!",

The first time we had reservations and hit traffic due to an accident on the freeway and would be at least 30 minutes late. I called 5 times and nobody picked up the phone at the hostess stand. When we got there, despite the restaurant being nearly empty, nobody was at the hostess stand and employees nearby were running around saying they'd be with us shortly. Actually, it was the same way the second visit as well. Where is everyone running to in an empty restaurant?  First time we went, we were asked if we were celebrating anything both at the time of reservations and when we got to the restaurant. We were, a birthday. I don't know why they ask because they didn't do  anything extra during the meal. Weird.  Complimentary bread options are awful. First time we went it was boring, low quality cold assorted rolls. Second time it was slices of raisin bread.   Starters: Lobster bisque and \"Vegas Caesar salad' which is basically a cob with Caesar dressing with capers and anchovy filets. Both are adequate. Lobster bisque tastes exactly like the lobster bisque at Brio.   Main: porterhouse steaks are adequate but lacking flavor. The brown sauce it automatically comes with on the side is straight up gross. It tastes sweet and oily. I had to request salt and pepper because the steak has no seasoning at all.   Sides: Lobster macaroni and cheese, and spinach. Mac and cheese tastes exactly like the lobster bisque but with noodles, which is not a complaint. No visible pieces of lobster, so I'm guessing it's lobster stock or something. Spinach is fine.   Dessert: cheesecake. Tastes like commerical cheesecake.   In general, the food is okay but forgettable. There is no wow factor and Vegas has a ton of steakhouses at a similar price point so competition is high. I have a feeling that they're not going to be in business much longer based off of how empty it was both times.",

    "text": "My wife thought we would enjoy dinner at ENVY so she purchased the dinner for two with drinks Groupon for $115. We weren't disappointed as this discount is an excellent value and we definitely got our money's worth. My steak exceeded my expectations and our server gave us top notch service without any prejudices you might see with other establishments that know you are using a coupon.  Parking was free for us at the Renaissance as the gate was open and the walk was short from the deck. We were seated immediately in a secluded booth when we arrived. The restaurant was quiet and not an overbooked madhouse where you can't hear yourself think or see your server only once or twice during the meal. Speaking of our server, Josh, with 11 years of experience, took great care of us, checking on us regularly. He guided us through the menu and offered great recommendations, even giving us a sampling of wine that we were on the fence about. He was great to talk to informing us about other specials the restaurant was offering in the future.  The options for appetizers, sides, and dessert were standard for a steakhouse but executed well. The 28 day dry aged beef for my bone-in ribeye was cooked to perfection, tender, and full of juicy flavor. There are other seafood and a pasta options on the menu if you didn't want to go the beef route. Little things like a sticky menu and fingerprints on the wine glass were turn offs. But we'll keep this steakhouse as an option as long we have a Groupon so we don't have to bust open the piggy bank like we would on the Strip.",

Service could have been a little faster, especially since there were hardly any other diners around. However, the servers were very nice and explained everything that came with the Groupon voucher upfront.  We ended up getting two 18 oz ribeyes, sauteed spinach, roasted baby beet salad, and cheesecake. Everything was pretty tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly. I would definitely consider coming back, as well as recommend this place, especially if they're still running the Groupon deal!",

And after reading reviews, decided to take the plunge for anniversary dinner. $115 for 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, 1 side to share, 2 entrees up to $52 each and 2 desserts.   Was not disappointed. Hotel was easy to access of Paradise Rd across from the Wynn. Parking was $7 for up to 4 hours for self parking, not bad at all. Parking garage is dim and not well lit, at least on the 3rd floor.   Was seated right away and the hostess took our Groupon voucher info before she sat us and asked if we were celebrating anything special. The restaurant was kind of empty with maybe about 5-6 tables/booths occupied.   Our server Joshua came out promptly and explained what we could order from the menu which was pretty much everything.   We had the crab cakes and shrimp cocktail for starters. Asparagus as the side order and the crab stuffed lobster tails. Everything was delicious in my opinion. Service was great. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "Last night here was a dream! From the moment that we walked in, we were treated with phenomenal service, especially with our server Stephanie who went above and beyond to make sure our night was one to remember. This was the perfect setting for an intimate anniversary dinner.   The complimentary bread was particularly delicious, and it came with three different types of bread- olive, asiago cheese, and sourdough. They were served warm with soft butter, which speaks a lot to the quality of the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari and the shrimp cocktail. I'm not usually a fan of calamari, but the one at Envy was mouth-watering. The calamari portion size was very generous, had the perfect crispness and were very well seasoned. They also came with two dipping sauces, tomato and an avocado crema. The shrimp cocktail were equally as impressive and came with three super size shrimps.    Let me tell you- the Truffle Parmesan Fries here are life. They come in a literal mountain of fries, and there more than enough to go around. They are super crispy or double-fried on the outside and soft on the inside and it comes with a yummy truffle aioli. Be careful- these are pretty addictive.   They generously gave us free asparagus to go with our mains for our anniversary. Our main courses were the Rack of Lamb and the Ribeye Steak with peppercorn sauce. Lamb is my absolute favorite, and it is so delicious here. Ours came with two racks of lamb, generously covered in a seasoned herb crust with a rich and flavorful side dipping sauce. The Ribeye Steak we ordered was super moist and delicious. I'm not sure if it's the best steak in town, but it sure was up there.   For the desserts, we got the chocolate cake and the cheesecake. I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate cake since it was too sweet for my liking, but the cheesecake was on point. The cheesecake itself was super creamy, rich and melt-in-your-mouth. It was the perfect was to end a perfect meal.",

Included was an appetizer for each person, an entree for each person, one side to be shared and a desert for each.   We had to park in the parking structure next to the hotel. Other guests have mentioned it, it's not well lit and we had to park on the 3rd floor since it looks like the first and second floors are designated for valet. General parking at the end of the night was $7.   When we entered, the hotel was rather empty but considering we went on a Tuesday night it was to be expected. We where greeted by the hostess and it went all great from there. She was very patient when asked questions including those pertaining to Groupon. She even helped me with pulling up the voucher which she needed the number for.   After being seated in one of the booths, We where greeted by our waiter Joshua. He was very friendly and attentive. My wife started off with the onion soup and I with the crab cakes. The crab cakes where amazing in which. I was later told they used three different types of crab meat. Then we proceeded with our entree which we both got he rib-eye....that did not disappoint! For a side, we got the buttery whipped mashed potatoes which where amazing as well. Lastly, we each got a cheese cake and chocolate cake w/vanilla ice cream. Still no disappointments.  Definitely recommend this place if your looking for a small, cozy steakhouse restaurant, this is your spot!",

We did not have to wait for anything with our waiter he was excellent. Didn't get his name as i was spending time with my family,  but he really set the bar for service this night. Though my family was  unimpressed with the food,  they were delighted with his service. Tall man,  tan, with colored eyes. We had dinner here around 9 pm on Tuesday. His service was 5 Star plus,  but because of the food i rated the restaurant a 2 star.   My lamb was recommended and I thought it to be delicious. However,  my aunt ordered a steak that was too charred and honestly small compared to what we've had in the last week at better steakhouses. My aunt did like the steak sauce but that's besides the point. My uncle was disgusted with his portion size of the salmon ( it looked like a 4th of the portion of the normal servings served here judging by Yelp pictures ), and the fish was way overcooked. Very tuff on a good size of each end. His lobster bisque was basic and tasted more like tomato soup, with barely any flavor of lobster.   Mind you,  our waiter aimed too please and offered several times to replace the dish with something else or comp the soup and the fish,  but my aunt and uncle wouldn't hear of it.  So we just broke up with Envy.",

I sat at the bar and the moment that one walks through the door the beauty of the restaurant surrounds you. The darker warm colors that they decided to decorate with really bring life to Envy. The hostess pointed that there was no waiting at the bar and she greeted me and made eye contact as I was approaching her. This is highly professional and and helpful to let me know we acknowledge one another mutually. The bartender handed me a drinks menu without me even having to ask. The uniforms that the staff where here are so upscale and they are more formally dressed than me.  I went with a comfort drink for me a vodka tonic. They only use top shelf alcohol here to make their mixed drinks and you can taste the difference. The bartender was very pleasant and asked if I would be dining tonight. I informed him I was just having drinks. He had a nice smile and demeanor about him. The service was fantastic. I did not stay long tonight at Envy since tomorrow is going to be a busy day for us at the last day of Pony Con!",

We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate which makes this  place a steal! We had the bone-in ribeyes and the truffle fries! The steak was complimented perfectly with the assorted flavored salts. The truffle fries are absolute perfection!!!!! I'm not sure anything can top them!   Our waiter, Joey, was attentive and friendly! While this restaurant is off the strip, it is fabulous and you really should try it. I haven't had anything better in Vegas....EVER! You can show up in casual dress or dressed up. We headed over to Envy after spending the day at the Hilton watching football for six hours. It is a low-key environment which is quiet, relaxing and low-key and much needed after hours of sensory overload in Vegas!",

We had visited one other time a couple of years ago and we thought the service and food was great and that is why we decided to go back again this time.  This time, however, was very special. My wife and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary on this night and everything was perfect. Joshua our waiter was very attentive and informative. He explained everything from their wine selection to the Chef's special and even the 3 three types of salt they had and what to use them on.  After dinner we engaged in small talk with Joshua were he discovered the purpose of our visit.  Joshua left and a few minutes later came back with desert for us compliments of Chef Michael.  They wrote on the plate Happy Anniversary with dark melted chocolate. A few minutes later Chef Michael came out to our table to meet us and chat. Later the manager came by to make sure our dining experience had been a good one. Joshua made our night very special, the food was amazing and we really appreciate that Chef Michael took the time to come out and personally wish us a happy anniversary!  We will definitely visit the Envy Steakhouse each time we visit Vegas!",

    "text": "Was in town for a few days and did some research.  Read some great reviews on this place and also saw the added bonus of using a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gc so decided to try it out.  Not sure if we got the \"coupon special\" or what but the food was forgettable.  We had the $75 gift cert but with tax and tip it still ended up coming to about 120 and I gotta say, I would have been much more satisfied just going to a buffet.  My bf and I started with the seafood tower which was pretty decent. He ordered the bone in rib eye and I got the tasting plate.  Both our steaks were flavorless and I'm not sure if they do that on purpose because they also serve an exotic salt tasting tray to put on the entrees (is it diy entree seasoning??).  My pork was so dry I wanted to spit it out.  The fish was okay.  The parmesan fries were alright but I was expecting somethign orgasmic based on reviews from others.  The creamed corn was great (and just about the only thing I enjoyed).  We also ordered the Smore dessert which also lacked flavor..the brownie just tasted like a crumbly mess..  All in all, DEFINITELY WOULD NOT GO BACK.  It was a major waste of money IMO.  Looking back, even our cab driver was like \"this is the first time anyone's ever asked to be taken here for a steak dinner..i'd go to Morton's instead.\"  Shoulda taken that as a sign.  The restaurant was also EMPTY at around 7PM on a Friday night.  You wouldn't find that at a restaurant on the strip with a comparable priced menu.",

We had a coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> and didn't even think about  Mother's Day being a holiday. They accepted the coupon no problem- first kudo. The service was outstanding with our server being neither intrusive nor absent and always being right there when we wanted something- second kudo. We had 4 different cocktails between us, all  of them very tasty. The spicy seared Ahi appetizer was amazing. The tequila-lime shrimp were huge, delicious and came with an excellent risotto. The bone in ribeye was cooked to perfection (MR as requested) and very flavorful and I had it Oscar style (sauteed crab meat and asparagus on top minus the hollandaise sauce for me) and the crab was the best I have ever tasted. The garlic mashed potatoes that came with the entrees were awesome, and the roasted veggies were also very good.We had a caesar salad- romaine was very crisp and the dressing was tasty. For dessert we had cheesecake with berry compote (strawberries, rasberries and bluberries were all fresh) which was so good we ordered a piece to go and the molten lava cake which was just good, nothing special. My wife had an after dinner coffee which she enjoyed as <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwell.So&s=468aae67ac5e8733d50d9412c302e92553f201d7e644455ed69599b0969b751d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">well.So</a>, Taste- third kudo. Quality of food- fourth kudo. Quantity of food- fifth kudo. Excellent food is going to be pricey. In Vegas it's even more pricey. But as hard as we tried, we still only brought the bill up to $199 (try doing that at Ruth's Chris or any other quality steakhouse in LV). Our coupon was $100 off with a purchase of $200 and while we didn't quite get there, the manager gave us our full discount without even a question. We will definitely be back- even without a coupon!",

I would DEFINITELY recommend the Truffle Mac & Cheese --- I can't even describe how good it was.  The place is pricey, but for a great steakhouse it is a bargain to treat yourself here once in a while.  I will definitely be going back.  I was especially pleased with how receptive the staff was to allow my wife and I to bring our 3 month old -- its a pretty nice place, the kind of place I wasn't sure a baby would fit in (but we were in town for business and didn't have a babysitter).....the staff was welcoming and made sure we had an extra large booth for the baby carrier.  However, I would try not to bring kids to this place -- just not the right ambiance.",

Main Course the bone in Rib eye ABSOLUTELY exceptional. One the best steaks I have ever enjoyed and I have tried every cut and every grade. The steak was also cooked to perfection the only temperature I eat is Black and Blue and this was perfect. The thing about steak houses what makes them good is the side dishes and the sides + apps + salads all mediocre. Dessert also just ok I had lemon custard. The steak was exceptional that's why it gets an extra star. Next ill go somewhere else for salads and apps and come there for main course. Best steakhouse in my mind is stil Charlie Palmers @ 4 Seasons because their apps and salads are so much better. Lets face it anyone can cook a prime piece of beef and as long as its not overcooked its going to be great! As i mentioned Black and Blue preperation at envy probably the best ive had.",

I opted for something new which was not a good idea.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my girlfriend ordered the \"salt brick\" roasted chicken.  The ribeye is considered their signature dish but it was average at best.  It was too charred on the outside and it overpowered the flavor of the meat.  The roasted chicken was not bad from what I can remember.  Other people claim it to be too salty but I didn't notice it.  We also ordered the bacon and gruyere mashed potatoes, which was delicious, and their signature truffle fries.  All the reviews hyped it up to be the greatest thing in the world but I'll have to disagree.  They do give a lot though, enough for atleast six people. The hotel and decor of the restaurant is really nice and the service was great but for me its all about the food.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed enough by it to consider going here again.",

The steak was done to perfection and the service was good.  The menu was a little skimpy, but perfectly adequate.  The ambience was nice and high class.  Not too busy the night we were there, but some low-life folks at the convention spilled over a little bit.  When will young people learn to have a little class?    My only objection, which applies to most modern restaurants, is the extremely inadequate 2-person tables--especially the ones stuck against a wall.  I refuse to fight such a table and will walk out of a restaurant before being punished by being seated there.  What are restaurants thinking of with this innovation?  I would rather stay home.  An upscale hotel like this--especially a Marriott brand--should be more sophisticated than this.     Insist on a spacious table and enjoy the great food.",

It started light with a rosemary bread and butter, to a salad, fancy crab cake, your choice of entree and then dessert. Each course was beautiful to look at and exquisite to taste. I must admit...I wanted my boyfriend's custard dessert more than my chocolate cake.

My husband had the lamb which was not cooked correctly - you know how it gets that weird odor when overcooked? - yup.  My steak was greasy-fatty, the mac&cheese side was greasy, salads plain and unremarkable.  It's kind of sad because we were treated to dinner by a vendor with the best intentions, but none of us had tried the restaurant and would not go back. I did have a creme brulee which was paired with an icewine, and that was quite good, but not good enough to save the meal.  I'm sorry, but one star is all this restaurant gets from us.",

Our server, Joshua was nice, a little too chatty for me but better than being snotty. The service was excellent and food was really great overall. I wish they offered more chicken entrees though, the one they did have included every vegetable I hate.",

When we first arrived the restaurant was maybe half full- the host told us it would be 10-15 minutes???? not sure why but no big deal. Our server was very friendly and efficient. We ordered a bottle of wine which was very reasonable. The food was good but not great. We started with a truffle soup which was a bit bland and too salty  then came the entree  I had a petite filet and my friend had the pork chop both were cooked the way we requested. The only dissapointment was the dessert- a creme brule that had a jellylike substance on the top-it had a weird feeling in the mouth. overall good but not memorable.",

    "text": "Saving the best review for last and what a way to wrap up our Vegas adventure.  We have been eating at a lot of high end steakhouses this year. I knew we wanted to go to a fancy place to celebrate my guy's birthday and since we were staying at The Renaissance and after reading the stellar reviews of this restaurant on Yelp, I knew this would be the restaurant for us. All of the room service at this hotel comes from this restaurant as well, so I had a feeling the meal would be good-I just had no idea as to how good.  The menu is creative. Everything like most high end steak houses is a la carte. Kevin started with the roasted tomato soup with fried Jarlsberg(his favorite) cheese. It was light and tasty. I had the spinach salad with pancetta, fried goat cheese and a bacon balsamic reduction. Both of these were a fabulous start to our meal and what we both appreciated was the size of these were perfect. Not too big, not too small.   Kev ordered the surf and turf (you get to choose which surf and turf) and he went with seared scallops and a petite fillet. I had the bone-in rib-eye steak and we opted for the lobster macaroni as our side (there were several we wanted but knew it would be too much food). Our waiter recommended the creamed corn, but we still went with the macaroni. Upon the arrival of our food, I was awe stricken at the presentation. Simple and elegant. My steak was perfectly charred on the outside and pink on the inside. Tender and flavorful, I closed my eyes and was taken back to a wonderful childhood memory of an old-time steakhouse in Phoenix called Durant's. I cannot remember the last time I had a steak this wonderful. Kev really loved his meal and said it was better than that of his last summer at Bradley Ogden and might even be better than Fleming's. The lobster macaroni was perfectly balanced in flavor with just enough lobster to cheese to pasta ratio. When I told our server how happy we were with the macaroni, he went to the kitchen and brought us out a small sample of the creamed corn. I hate to admit this, but dang, that was probably the most delicious sample of anything I have ever tasted. It was made with fresh roasted corn, bacon and a hint of cheese.   To end our meal, our waiter brought Kevin a banana bread pudding (which was incredible) with caramel gelato and cashew brittle. He even had Happy Birthday written in caramel on the plate.  Our server was fantastic. He treated us like royalty and even comped a second glass of wine and our dessert. After our disastrous meal at earlier in the week at Ruth Chris in Walnut Creek, I was overwhelmed with joy.  Highly recommended. Take the time, take the taxi and make reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> and get to this fabulous restaurant!",

    "text": "This restaurant is the first one that's made me stand up and say: DAMN. I seriously have to write about this place. It's the first restaurant in Vegas that I've been to where I honestly believe they've matched the quality of some of the best contemporaries out there.   I historically don't like to write reviews of places that are mediocre or bad because... well, I think it's a waste of my time, not to mention it's sort of bad karma and being that most places in Vegas just aren't that outstanding save for about 4-5 restaurants and shows, that means very few reviews are worth writing - at least for me.  But Envy definitely passes that \"reviewability\" filter.  WARNINGS ABOUT ENVY:  - It doesn't have the decor of Prime.  - It lacks the \"beautiful people\" and \"see-and-be-seen bar\" of CUT.  - It doesn't have a big name chef in it's name like Mario Batali's Carnevino.  - It doesn't have the busy, electric atmosphere of Stripsteak.   No, this review is all about service, food, and \"would I go back?\".   1) TASTE  The 19oz bone-in Rib Eye was truly one of the best steaks I've had. And in Vegas of all places I don't say this often but eating this steak actually makes me cringe with delight. Y'know how when something tastes so soft, so moist, so perfectly charred, so evenly flavorful throughout, the back of your mouth actually aches? Yeah - that's the Rib Eye. Only in Texas and in New Orleans have I had a steak this good.  ...And then they had a grilled Yellowtail on a bed of crab & avocado salsa with a light mustard sauce that was a very good accompaniment as a sort of 'surf & turf'.  The fish was lightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside bursting with that light yellowtail flavor people enjoy. ...I had a delicious crab bisque as well that was bowl licking good.  I actually came with two lightly flavored tempura-fried crab legs as well, that were sort of unnecessary but quite nice to have to compliment the saltiness of the bisque. Haven Syrah: 4/5 Crab Bisque:  4/5 Ribeye Bone-in:  5/5 Yellowtail over Crab/Avocado:  5/5 Wild Mushrooms: 4/5  2) VALUE  I walked out with a $100 bill (discounted using the RESTAURANT.COM $25-for-$10 coupon available for purchase) and found myself surprised at this.  I mean seriously:  This meal would have been at least $50 more anywhere else.  The whole \"under $60\" benchmark really doesn't hold on average when it comes to Vegas steakhouses for the most part.  3) SERVICE My waiter, what can I say... he wore me down and I could help but like & respect the guy.  He knew every dish very well (and he was accurate which I verified through my 3 items), he could target specific dishes to different preferences based on simple questions, he was Johnny-on-the-spot with everything - the dishes were SMOKIN' hot off the grill - as were the bus boys, and he was friendly as all heck. ...And of course the manager stopped by as with all good restaurants to ensure he's getting accurate feedback on the experience.  4) MENU This is probably more of a personal preference but I really liked the menu.  Lord if I could only remember everything on there, but I just recall really liking everything I saw on there and wishing that I could sample a little of everything.  (Props to the girl that recommended the wild mushrooms in a prior review.  They are quite good.) ...This is in contrast to some other menus that I've seen of steakhouses in Vegas.  The names shall remain hidden but there's some steakhouses in Vegas where you really have to wonder, \"Why the hell are they serving THAT here?  Who'd go to a steakhouse and eat that?\"  A note on the atmosphere: I walked into the hotel lobby and found myself asking, \"Uh... where is the restaurant?\" and then later looking into the place and asking, \"Uh... is it open?\" because no one was there.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself asking the same questions.  I think another reviewer even said something similar.  It's not very busy and certainly isn't very high profile next to some of the other Vegas steakhouses.  SUMMARY: Envy gets a very solid 5-stars. It's worth taking the side trip to the Renaissance Hotel for this place.  From here on out, I can confidently say Envy will be a must-visit for me in Vegas.    (And to the people who reviewed Envy, admitted they went to a steakhouse and then ordered something other than beef:  Uh... seriously, WTF?  That's like going to an aquarium and asking where the zebras and giraffes are at.)",

We were visiting Vegas for our 10 year wedding anniv. and stayed at the Palazzo.I was able to get a $75.00 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. certificate.    This restaurant was our favorite dining experience while we were in Vegas for 4 nights.  Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared.  The truffle fries were unbelievably good and our waiter Joshua was awesome.  The only complaint that keeps me from giving a 5 stars was when our total came to close to $135.00 we gave the $75.00 gift cert. and $100.00 bill.  Instead of bringing us the correct change Joshua took out his 18% tip first without asking and brought the remaining change.  I understand this practice when you have a group of 6 or more but it was just my husband and I.  We had planned to give him at least 20% tip and this definately brought down my opinion.  Perhaps he had some bad experience with people not tipping on the full amount before? Irregardless he was a great waiter, kept our drinks full and answered all our questions easily.",

    "text": "If you regularly eat at decent restaurants, much of Vegas can be somewhat disappointing. Envy, on the other hand, was a total surprise. We made a reservation for dinner and I was a bit nervous when we entered the near-empty restaurant. Maybe people don't know about this place or are wary of the prices. Either way, those dummies are totally missing out.  I ordered a salad to start and it was big enough to split. The bread was delicious (especially the olive bread) and the butter was room temp, perfect for spreading. We both ordered petit filets, and both were cooked to the perfect temperature, a disturbing rarity these days. For sides, we split garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. Both sides were delicious and were more than enough for 2 people. To finish, we had coffee, no room for desert.  In general, the prices were on par with other steakhouses around the country and the use of a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a> gift certificate makes this one a bit more affordable for a special night out.

The steaks were excellent and this was the first time I've came across a bone-in filet mignon.  In my opinion, the taste is worth giving up a few ounces in the cut size.  It's not likely you will leave hungry if you grab a couple of sides with your meal.  Garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies are given to you gratis, but push them aside and ask for the mac n' cheese and creamed corn. You won't be sorry!",

I have to agree with everyone else who raved about the cream corn, do yourself a favor and try it. For steaks we went with the bone in ribeye and porterhouse. Both were cooked to perfection. I'd give the nod the ribeye if choosing favorites. Finally ready to explode got a smore for dessert.

    "text": "I ordered the Chilean sea bass ($39) and truffle fries ($9). So. Much. Oil. When the server first mentioned the butter infusion I didn't think much of it, but once I actually got it into my mouth whoa nelly. While it was cooked nicely, it was just too greasy for me. I may be a bit sensitive to oily or greasy food, but I felt the panko crust was gritty and unappetizing as a result of the oil and butter. The fries were very good but unfortunately the fish was so oily I had to stop eating the fries. I really didn't like the food here overall but the service was solid. With so many steakhouses in Vegas, this one is hard to recommend.",

The Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel, where this restaurant is located caters to convention guests.  Since there was no big convention, the restaurant was ours. Service was outstanding. Food was excellent. Prices are what I expected being from a nice LV steakhouse, I've been to places directly on the strip with higher price tags. They made the dinner special for our mom's by providing dessert with a special message to them, I think that's fabulous customer service. Manager came over and talked to us for a bit which I thought made the restaurant as a whole stand out.  Will be back!",

    "text": "During a weekend trip to Vegas, some friends and I decided that the \"Hey, how often are you in Vegas?\" mentality, which is, as you can maybe imagine, unbelievably dangerous. The result? ENVY Steakhouse.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  While by Vegas standards this may be standard (comparable to some of the restaurants in the popular hotels), ENVY is without a doubt very, very nice. The atmosphere is elegant, and our server was absolutely brilliant. Not only did he know everything about the menu, but he was brilliantly helpful pointing us in the direction of the evening's festivities. To top it all off, our orders were all perfect (party of six) and service was prompt. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  This is always tricky with nicer restaurants since you're obviously paying for the experience, but even taking that into consideration, I can't quite justify the $36 that I paid for ENVY's Shellfish Stew:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vIZ9bM2Z2MSTY0U4ZGDbNQ&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  When it comes down to it, I'm looking at about six shrimp, half of a potato, five clams and at most two crab legs. $36? Sorry. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  While lacking in the portion department, the quality of ENVY's food really is quite good. My Shellfish Stew was tasty, and the filet mignon that one of my friends got was nothing short of one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had. Dual Stars Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Even if I were made of money, ENVY's somewhat limited menu, high prices and proximity from the Strip are enough to keep it from being a repeat evening out. No Star Granted.",

My last visit was to celebrate my friend's wedding.  So she was still in her wedding dress for dinner.    Joshua was our server and he's amazing.  Funny, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive.  I will definitely ask to sit in his section next time I go.  To start we had the black pepper calamari & rock shrimp.  I ordered the rib eye and my boyfriend ordered the salmon.  Both cooked to perfection and delicious.  Sides ordered were creamed corn, asparagus and the mashed potatoes.  For desert I had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and crumbled bacon.  It was amazing.  The sweet and salty combination was perfect.  My favorite part of the meal is the variety of sea salts the provide to try on the different items.  I don't remember what salt goes with what items but the black salt was amazing on the steak!   They were nice enough to serve us a round of champagne to toast the newlyweds.  I utilized a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for this visit as I have done in the past.  They never expire and Envy certs sell out fast so if you see one buy it and ask to sit in Joshua's section.  You won't regret it!",

The discount was a nice draw to get me here, but I was impressed and would go back.  BREADBASKET: Okay, bread is pretty basic but they also give you this killer kalamata olive tapenade. ESPRESSO RUBBED SKIRT STEAK: Espresso flavor was bold, this dish was better than expected. FRIED CALAMARI: Large portion, two dipping sauces, preferred the spicy ketchup. BF really enjoyed this app. CAESAR SALAD: served with large anchovies, and dressed just right. Better than the usual version you find at steak places. SIGNATURE SEA BASS: I'm more of a trout kind of girl, but the promise of a truffle crust lured me in. The fish was well executed, moist, and flaky, and the portion was generous. BF also enjoyed this. FLANK STEAK: Menu lists this as a 12 ounce portion, but what we received was huge. Even with both of us eating at it, we had nearly a third to take home. Cut was recommended by our waiter. LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE: Not too cheesy, not to heavy on the seafood sweetness, good complement to the other dishes without being ridiculously rich.  Entree meats are served with a trio of salts to season yourself. That and the live jazz drifting from the lobby were nice little extra touches that added to the experience. Black and red decor scheme with luxe accents made this place feel like more of a splurge than it really was.  Unfortunately I cannot remember our servers name, but he was pretty great. Service all around was good throughout our visit, from the manager who seated us to the sweet guy that bussed our table.",

    "text": "Coming to Envy was a simple choice -- it was located in the hotel that I was staying in on a business trip. I was looking forward to it after my boss, who is a foodie too, told me to try it. But anytime a restaurant has a coupon on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>, I start to worry about the quality of their food. Nevertheless, because of convenience, my coworker and I went there for dinner one night. I had made a reservation through OpenTable but he beat me to the punch and called it in from his room. They greeted us by name and promptly sat us in a booth. The restaurant decor was nice and modern.   We both had the warm spinach salad with goat cheese, pancetta, with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was delicious and started the meal off right. I had the bone-in filet which was pretty good but not the best I've had. Albeit, the price is $15-20 less than what you'd be paying on the strip and the entree came with complimentary sides (mashed potatoes and vegetables that weren't very good). My coworker ordered the burger of the month - Delicious Ode to Surf and Turf - 'Best of Both Worlds Burger' which had filet mignon and medallions of lobster tail. It was accompanied by the truffle-reggiano fries that I was also looking forward to. Too bad it just tasted like oil. The burger sounded too good on paper to be True. The toppings didn't fit, it was hard to eat and apparently did not sit well with him over night.   Overall, it was a good experience for me. Great service, nice ambiance, decent food for the price (after the coupon) but I probably won't be back.",

We wouldn't have minded so much but the waiter never even came over to our table to tell us it was taking a little longer than it should have been.   We decided to split the bone in filet - which we never had before, but thought we would try something new because the waiter recommended that over the regular filet mignon.  We were very disappointed, especially for the price ($56) for a small steak (compare to $48 for the filet).    We spent way too much money on a below average meal and service.

It's located at the Renaissance on Paradise which is a little ways off of the strip but right next to the convention center monorail station. The decor is nice, its dim and quite trendy as the name ENVY should imply.   I've dined here on two occasions, once with myself and once with a friend and of course I went for the surf and turf both times. Whats great is the fact that they give you the option to mix and match what cut of steak you want and what type of seafood you want. I'm unfortunately a square and went with the rib-eye and seared scallops both times.   My steak was ordered medium-rare and came out just the way I like it. The scallops were cooked brilliantly and were topped with a fantastic pesto sauce. All steaks here are served with three different salts that you can add at will. There was a sea salt, a garlic salt, and some Hawaiian salt that was amazing. They tell you to use it sparingly as a little salt goes a long way.   I showered in that shit.   I ordered a pinot noir with my entree which was great and then a room temp white sambuca for dessert. After each meal I was filled to the brim with food and wine and was feeling quite good about myself.   It's a shame that this place is off the strip and at a hotel where there is no gaming. Still, it has become a staple of my Las Vegas trips. I can't recommend it enough.",

    "text": "Remembering how good it was for brunch, I called these guys up and made reservations for our little family reunion of 7. For large parties they take a credit card down and if there are any cancellations, they charge $20/per person. I didn't think much of it because of the wonderful brunch I had on my last visit. However, I ended up checking the dinner menu online AFTER I had made the reservation and my eyes grew wide as I saw the prices listed. Dang!!! (Note to self: Always check the menu before you book a reservation!!!) Oh well, I wasn't planning on spending that much but I was totally down to pay half our bill if necessary since I booked the place.  It's not often we have a family reunion.  Aside for the price shock, which was my fault anyway, we proceeded to the establishment. It's a nice, classy joint. I would suggested some decent clothing, no shorts and tuck in your shirt. Our table was all ready to go once we go there and we sat comfortably in our own area.  The food was AWESOME! With 7 of us, we got a bunch of different things and we all shared what we got.  Some got a nice salad to start, \"Fresh Mozzarella & Heirloom Tomato with Sweet Balsamic Syrup.\" Presentation was nice and it tasted just as good as it looked. We also got 3 choices of bread to munch on until the main course came along.    For the big meal we all had steaks. The fillet mignon was nice and tender and the bone-in ribeye(which is they're signature steak) was ohh soo good.  All that, topped out with a good red wine hit the spot. We were loving every bite!  The sides here are what make this place stand out. We scarfed down the Grilled Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce. Then we tried the 3 different mac and cheese dishes(Three Cheeses, Truffle, & Bacon and Gruyere Cheese) and 3 different kinds of mashed potatoes(Garlic, Truffle, & Bacon and Gruyere). We got the samplers to try each of them and ALL were good. I had trouble deciding what was best.  One last thing, try the truffle fries! You won't be disappointed.  The staff was real good and we were taken care of extremely well. My only suggestion is I wish they had their steaks served on a hot plate.  That's fairly minor compared to how great everything was.  Yeah, the bill came and it was fairly hefty but I had no complaints about the meal or service.  It was a great time for all of us and I absolutely felt it was money well spent.",

All steaks, no matter the cut, were $45. Also, all the cuts were abnormally larger than what you normally get at most steakhouses. Thus justifying the higher cost.  However, when everyone on the table is struggling to finish the hunk of steak, then we're not enjoying it anymore. It would be better to reduce the size of the steaks and the price, and up the quality.  I tried the strip steak and rib eye. Both were decent, but not mind blowing good, especially given the price tag.   The sides of garlic mashed potatoes and veggies were good though. No need to order additional sides given the huge portions you have already.",

He didn't even bother to hype up the steaks cuz apparently ENVY's claim to fame are their truffle fries. ENVY definitely came through.   Surrounded by dudes that can flat out eat, we had three orders of 19 oz bone-in rib eyes, three orders of truffle fries, a sampler, four orders of soup, and bacon mac and cheese. I think we consumed a whole cow over dinner. The food was absolutely amazing. I also need to send a special shout out to the watress for continously filling my plate with the macadamia sweet bread.  The food was reasonably priced and the place had a very comforting ambiance. It's nice to get some peace and quiet for a minute since the hotel is off the strip. Look for valet guy Wayne on your way out of the hotel. Dude has the key to a lot of Vegas hot spots.   FYI - Apparently there is a huge discount coupon floating around online. I've yet to find it.

That said, our experience was one not to forget. The restaurant knew of our anniversary and the staff did an outstanding job to help us celebrate including a card personally delivered by who I assume is one of the heads of the restaurant that included a personal note. Their service is still impeccable. We used a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate and ate like royalty. Everything is al a carte. The sides are huge enough to share and still just as fantastic as we remembered. I was a little disappointed yet strangely happy they still had the same menu for the most part. I didn't notice much difference from the menu in 2008 to 2011. In a sense I wanted to try something new, but I was happy to revisit the food I had years ago as delicious as it was. If it ain't broke don't fix it? Unfortunately, my steak was WAY overcooked for ordering medium well. Like WAY overcooked.   Disappointing kitchen faux paux but I suppose things happen. I guess they didn't want to waste any more than I did. The waiter even noticed just by looking at the steak and ordered another one, but didn't come until we were completely finished with the meal so they bagged it up to go for us. Unfortunately we stayed out all night without going back to our room to put it in a fridge and didn't get a chance to keep it refrigerated :( and it got thrown away. Vegas.... Perhaps that is something that SHOULD have stayed in Vegas but oh well, just being honest I guess. But I do appreciate the effort!   All in all, still the #1 splurge spot for when we visit and as you can tell by their stellar reviews, this is not a place to overlook when you're there.",

The service was great.  The seafood tower for two was actually very good, and the creamed corn was awesome.  So why only 3 stars?  I had their \"Envy Signature\" bone-in ribeye and it was ... well, very charred on the outside.  I read a couple other people mentioning this as well.  I guess the chef must be purposely doing this, but the way mine was cooked I could only taste carcinogens.  I tried all three different salts to spruce things up a bit, but of course that just resulted in over-salting.  When I was at Cut, the meat had a similar consistency but somehow just tasted a whole lot better.  The truffle fries basically tasted like any other fries to me.  If anything, I could only taste the cheese they'd grated onto it.  We used a $75 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, so with tax it only came out to $90.  (We knew we'd be doing a lot of drinking later, so we passed on the wine.)  Decent value, but I probably won't be going back.",

It's a bit north of the Paradise restaurant corridor, in the Renaissance in a not so inviting area... so valet. The Renaissance is nice inside & the valets & restaurant hosts were welcoming. The steakhouse is quite lovely- open, well lit, contemporary with a red, warm richness. Our waitress, Nikki, was smiley & sincere. We got complimentary olive bread & french bread- warm with room temp butter & yummy. Tomato caprese for an app was the only part of our meal that lacked- the mozzarella balls had zero flavor & there was hardly any balsamic but the colorful heirloom tomato arrangement was a nice touch. We both ordered filets then shared a sauteed mushroom medley & garlic mashed potatoes. We also asked for each of the sauces to play with. The steaks were great, the sauces were fun, the mushrooms were plentiful & the potatoes, while not especially garlicky, were velvety. For dessert, we got the flourless chocolate cake & creme brulee- both were decadent (& I'm a creme brulee snob). All in all, we really enjoyed our experience- definitely recommend, would definitely like to go back. Unfortunately, that area just isn't the 1st place I think to spend an evening!",

A lot of places overcook these until the calamari is like a pencil eraser but these were perfect; done just enough to be cooked but still with a smooth texture.

Other guests said that the supposed prime rib eye steak was not \"prime\" grade, but more like \"choice\".

    "text": "My mom and I dined here for a late mother's day meal in 2010 (read: I was too busy traveling to other places - without her - and she made it pretty clear I was to make it up to her).   We placed the menus aside and let the waiter walk us through a pretty amazing meal. They were offering tasting plates and other specials and we couldn't make a decision... So we opted for everything on the left side and ran with it.   The waitstaff (we had a team taking care of us) was amazing and on top of their game. Never did we have to ask for a refill, an extra ______, or more of ________. Everything we needed (and some things we didn't know we needed) appeared without effort or request. It was a little scary, that kind of proactive attention... and it very much spoiled us.   We tasted petite filet, short ribs, stuffed pork chop, lamb, and the beef cheeks. The beef cheeks... the beef.... oh, sorry. I'm back. I was daydreaming. A-may-zing dish. Even with tasting portions we sent quite a bit of food home with Mom. I hear my nephew inhaled the remainder of the beef cheeks and generally drove his parents nutty over procuring more... as quickly as possible.  The vegetable sides (broccolini, asparagus, and carrots) were crisp and fresh and the perfect contrasting accompaniment to the various meat dishes. The sauteed mushrooms were beautifully prepared and sauced just right. Mom also tried a truffled potato which she liked very much. The truffle wasn't lost as it sometimes is in truffle-decorated dishes, and it gave the dish a nice flavor. The salads were underwhelming, pedestrian. Considering the level at which everything else was executed, we were a bit disappointed. To be fair, they weren't bad... just not at the level of everything else.  The wine options are broad and the staff was spot on for most of their suggestions (there were a couple that fell flat, but I think that may be related more to personal preferences versus the wine itself).  We opted not to go for dessert this time around as we were taking so much food home already. Speaking of... as they packaged up our meal for transport, the staff was courteous enough to provide sauces to go with the various dishes, some of their seasoned and smoked salts, and other items, along with verbal instructions to make the reheated meal not just another plate in the oven or microwave.  I may not have popped in here if not for a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificate. It's a bit off the beaten path, and there are so many amazing steakhouses in town... it wasn't on my to-do list and no one I knew had been here. That said, I am glad I did. The meal was very well orchestrated, the staff was knowledgeable, and the food - the most important part - was delicious.  Because of that experience, I have been in here a few times since then. Nothing quite to the level of what we had that night, but pretty great nonetheless. From a small, intimate dinner to a larger group, the staff and food never disappoint. The attitude is always \"under promise and over deliver,\" and that they do. Very well.",

We were very pleased with the staff and food. My friend has a gluten allergy and the wait-staff was very accommodating and helpful in their options. They were also great about allowing us to split a salad and entree. They even split it before bringing it out to us.   The New York strip we split was absolutely amazing. It was thick and flavorful. They give you a side of 3-types of seasoned sea salts. The Australian smoked sea salt on the steak was delicious and perfectly complimented the steak. The side order or mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables were awesome. Next time I am in Vegas I will be sure to stop here again!",

We had the Travelzoo deal which was awesome!!  \"Rated \"excellent\" (25) by Zagat for its food, ENVY The Steakhouse dishes out \"simply delicious\" steaks well worth the time of Vegas locals, says Las Vegas Weekly\"  We began the night with two seasonal soups. I had the chilled asparagus which was a cold soup and it was DELICiOUS!! I was surprised how good cold soup could be haha. My boyfriend had the tomato soup - it was decent.   Continued with an appetizers- black pepper calamari and rock shrimp with ginger-mirin aioli  For our entree my boyfriend had steak and I had the portabello mushroom cake. We then ordered the bittersweet chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream for desert. It was a bit too rich for me but it was good - we didn't finish it though because it got a little overwhelming.  Service was awesome. The GM came out to say high to us, and our waiter was cheerful and observant. Our drinks were refilled before it hit the middle mark.",

ENVY is located slightly off the strip on paradise and the renaissance hotel? i can't remember. anyway, the decor was simple enough. service was EXCELLENT. very warm and friendly.  they gave me a complimentary champagne and bday card (my bf told them it was my bday when he made the reservation).  now to the important stuff: THE FOOD: out of our party of 6, 5 ordered the ribeye. i was the only one who ordered the sampling (of sea bass, short rib, and filet). it was good.  all three dishes where well balanced....but i did ENVY everyone else who had their own 19 oz ribeye- HUGE. if you're on a budget, share.   the sides are a la carte as well so order 1 of each that u crave, and if you crave some more, order more! PLEASE try the CREAMED CORN, and FRENCH FRIES. we also ordered the asparagus w/ hollandaise and mac and cheese. though i love food, i like to keep things simple w/ my steak, so next time, i'm sticking to steak, corn, and fries. nothing else. and no need for steak sauce here! they did have some salt samples available which were AMAZING.   feel free to check out their website.  i always like a restaurant who puts their prices on their menus online. shows honesty- like they're not too scared to put their prices up to scare away patrons.",

We went here on a Tuesday and it was surprisingly busy. Luckily we had a reservation, and were seated right away. I had looked up the menu on there website, so I had an idea of the menu. Upon receiving our menu it was a little different from the one online. I was really looking forward to trying there huge seafood platter that I had seen everywhere on Yelp, but our waiter informed us it had been taken off the menu and was no longer available. I was so bummed, also they didn't have a drink menu. Who doesn't have a drink menu? She made some really good suggestions tho and I ended getting a fruit punch. We ordered some truffle fries and those were really addicting, the mashed potatoes were a little too bland for me, no flavor at all. Overall the food was just ok, but nothing really wows you. Our waiter was also great, she was very sweet and knowledgeable. I did notice they have brunch and there menu sounds really good, so maybe we'll give that a try someday.",

    "text": "Had the best ever dining experience here last weekend to celebrate our anniversary!  After all the great reviews on Yelp and the can't-miss-out deal on Travelzoo ($79 for $149 worth of food and wine), the boyfriend and I made a trip out of the strip to this fancy steakhouse.   We were greeted by the host whom straight off the bat knew was expecting us and congratulated on our anniversary. When we sat I noticed the sun was in my face and asked to move to another seat. Our server Josh was more than happy to give us a booth seat which was not as blinding and much more romantic. His service was great from start to finish. From the recommendations to our wine pairings to making it the best anniversary dinner either of us have ever had.   We strayed away from ordering wine as I did not see that one and only wine I can actually tolerate on the menu. I also told Josh about it. To my surprise, after ordering, he came back with two glasses of wine with raspberries inside and said it may not be the only wine I liked but he thinks it may be close. I took a sip and he was right, it was not the wine I liked, it was something MUCH better. Sweeter taste without that slight bitter aftertaste. I DRANK THAT WHOLE GLASS LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS. I was so impressed with Josh's knowledge to find my perfect wine match. That same description of wine I have told so many other servers and got nowhere near the taste.   Onto our dinner- We started off with the Seafood Plateau. Great deal for $55 for a party of max 4. For us 2, We were just stuffing away. Freshest oysters I have ever had. The chef did a great job cleaning it out. The shrimps, mussels, clams are all great. Lobster cut into chunks making it easier for us to stab at. The crab legs were very long and full of crab meat.   Then came our main entree and sides. They do not joke around here. 2 double cut lamb racks cooked perfectly and seasoned. Their signature sea bass with it's flaky crust and very silky texture inside. Did not regret the choices! For the sides, we had the bourbon creamed corn which was my favorite of them all. Very nice twist to the traditional one. Lobster mac and cheese. Not overpowering with the lobster but a good proportion. Mushroom medley that was nice to have along with all the protein and carbs we were consuming. Josh brought us two different kinds of salt and they helped enhanced the flavor especially with the mushroom. In addition, our entrees came with garlic mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts with bacon. Mashed potatoes was fluffy and thank gosh for some veggies in our meal with the Brussels sprouts.   When we could not stuff our self any more, we got our food wrapped up in boxes as we prepare our self for what people call dessert. Chocolate molten cake with a toffee sauce was just the cherry on the dining experience. My boyfriend devour it despite how full he was from the meal we just had.   Our dinner from beginning to end was way more than we anticipated. Many time, when we go into a dinner with any type of coupon or voucher, we immediately get the less than regular guest treatment. Not here. In fact, we got the VIP treatment. Our water was never less than 3/4 full, the manager even came by to ask how everything was and wish us a Happy Anniversary.   I could not have asked for a better last night in Vegas for the boyfriend and I. Loved the experience, loved the service, loved the food. Cannot wait to bring my close friends here to share the wonderful experience with again!",

We were able to get a table at 7PM via the Open Table app, which was surprising, given that this is an extremely busy time for Las Vegas restaurants. The decor of the restaurant is contemporary and high-end. Every employee was polite, but we were confused as to who our server was. One person took our drink order, another took our food order (we assumed that was our server, but never saw him again after he asked what we wanted to eat), another brought out our food, and yet another asked for our dessert order and brought our check. The incorrect meal was brought out to me, so the kitchen gave us complimentary dessert to make up for it, which was a nice gesture. I ordered the Chilean sea bass, which was delicate and buttery, but not very hot (could be because my plate was not brought out with the others). The wild mushrooms were delicious, and the au gratin potatoes were tasty as well. Everything was very good, but perhaps not to the caliber of an upscale restaurant, as pricing on the menu would suggest. I would definitely come back, and would hope the minor glitches we experienced were a result of a busy week of CES clientele in the restaurant.",

Well, it's not that dramatic but I do think food quality ranges from nearly excellent to meh.    Breakfast is served here from 6:30-noon.  Coffee was pretty good and so was that complimentary smoothie thing.  Steak and eggs were awesome for $21.  The steak was so good and tender I thought I should come back for dinner...and I did.   For dinner I ordered the 17 ounce bone in ribeye medium rare.  The edges were flavorful and tender but as I got closer to the bone it was chewy like too much gristle.  Only the edges were good the rest was yucks.  Also the dinner steak is finished in some demi-glaze sauce that does nothing but ruin the texture.  Just finish it with clarified butter I say!  My dinner cost three times as much as my breakfast but it was unfortunately NOT 3 times as good.    One thing that is consistent is the good attentive service.  The staff is really nice and thoughtful.  So I guess I'll stick to breakfast the next time I'm here.",

The staff is beyond friendly, the ambiance is great and the food .. I don't even know where to begin with how amazing every course of the meal is. Honestly, the best filet, asparagus, caesar salad and french onion soup I've ever had.  I also have to note how wonderful our waiter, Krisztian Farkas, was. His service was beyond exceptional and he went out of his way to make the night special for us. The epitome of great customer service.  All around an absolutely fantastic experience that I recommend to everyone!",

    "text": "There is nothing to Envy at Envy.     I am extremely disappointed to have a negative review but Envy is nothing more than an over zealous Applebees. Now I have dined at this restaurant 2 times during my trip.     The first night I dined at Envy I had the sea bass and broccollini. The broccollini was under steamed and very bland. The sea bass was bland as well and not cooked as well as I care for. I did not send it back because it took nearly an hour for my food to get to me with 3 other tables filled.      The second night I ordered the Cesar salad and the filet minon. This time the service was much better so I was more optimistic in the beginning. When I got the Cesar salad I was pleased to see sardines. Then shortly after receiving my salad I got my steak. I ordered my steak medium rare. This is a fairly expensive resturant yet they do not know how to cook a steak. I received a steak that had not sat and had the steak go medium within the time of me eating it. It took quite a bit to cut up my steak so I was extremely disappointed in the steak, it was probably one of the worst steaks I have ever bought.      Overall I was extremely disappointed in the quality of food. This restaurant is by no means at all a fair priced restaurant. The plates lacked appeal, all of my plates (other than the Cesar) were very simple and boaring to look at. This resurant does not know how to cook the food they serve. They either need to re train their cooks or hire a more qualified chef. Do Not dine here it is simply not worth your time or money.",

We were kindly given a basket of bread with very soft, tasty butter. We both got the french onion soup. Very traditional tasting, slightly on the saltier side, but we dipped bread in it. The second course we both also got the iceberg lettuce with bacon bits and red onion. This was our favorite out of the six courses. The sauce made the dish and I have not been so impressed with a salad dish until today. The third course, my bf got the crab cake and I got the calamari. Both were tasty. The crab cake was soft and cooked to perfection, while the calamari was crisp and tasty with the dipping sauce. Our fourth course was the gnocci. This dish didn't feel like a course, but more like a sample since it was served on a small puny dish with 4-5 pieces of gnocci. The taste was amazing though, especially the sauce. Our main course (5th course) was the 4oz filet. I had it cooked medium rare and my bf had it rare. The filet mignon was yummy and perfectly cooked to our liking. The vegetables and potatoes were yummy as well. We just hoped it would have been plated instead of put in separate bowls for us to scoop from. We were so full and packed our dessert (last course) to go. We got cheesecake and carrot cake. Both were good, but cheesecake was the tastier one. Overall, we had a great experience. My bf loved the wine. For me, I don't drink wine. The waiter was super kind and very attentive.",

The service was great: very attentive, had suggestions and was very friendly.    The food was surprisingly a little disappointing. 3 out of us ordered the sirloin steak and we all ordered it medium well, mine was cooked pretty medium well but it could've used a little more flavor. I also ordered mine Oscar style and I loved asparagus and the sauce helped with the flavor of the steak.  But one was overcooked, to the point of well done and you can taste bits of char while the other was more medium and a little bloody when she cut into it. The side portions were huge though which was an unexpected pleasure. I had ordered the baked potato and instead of getting one, I got two! as the waiter said it seemed too small even though they were both big to me so that was nice (just wish it had come with bacon as well!) but it came with sour cream, cheese and green onions as toppings.   Service was great, no complaints there and the food was okay, but personally I was expecting more flavor from the food. Everything was just okay, nothing to wow me.",

We came here because we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate.  We had to spend $112.50 to get $75 off.  Not a bad deal and easy to spend since this restaurant is very pricey.    We were seated right away and they took our orders.  It did take a while to get the food since we ordered a big chunk of meat bigger than my head!!!  We basically ordered 3 things and that was the perfect amount to get $75 off!  The chef gave us a spoon of a complimentary dish..I forgot what it was but it had beets, which I am not a fan of but it was okay.    Complimentary Bread:  FREE bread is always the best!!  Taste great with butter!!  Truffle-Reggiano Fries ($10): If you are a french fry lover like I am, this is definitely for you!  OMG this was a big mountain of fries that you can literally share with the von trapp family!!  These were perfectly seasoned with the write amount of cheese!  Mouth watering!  Signature Whiskey Cream Corn ($10):  I LOVE CORN!  So creamy and delicious!  must try!  40oz \"Tomahawk\" Bone-In Ribeye ($95):  This is by far the most expensive thing I have ever eaten in my entire life!!  This was the biggest piece of meat I've ever eaten as well (that's what she said).  Although I would have loved to love this giant piece of meat, I felt that this was a little to salty.  Maybe it was because we added the foie gras butter ($8), but still, it was way to salty!  I enjoyed the sides way more than the main meat itself.  We had so much left over that 2 more people could actually finish off our dinner.  We saved it and it actually came in handy for a late midnight snack.  We cut up the meat and threw it in the fries.  Semi carne asada fries?? It was delish, or maybe it was because we were drunk and really hungry?  Overall, good dinner but not great.  Also, I would think that at a very high end restaurant, when they say \"happy anniversary\" or \"happy birthday\" or some kind of special occasion, I would think they would give some kind of free dessert.  They really should!  Even a scoop of ice cream would have done justice!  Maybe take that into consideration??  I think this restaurant should!!!

    "text": "DON'T BE JEALOUS  When in Vegas, I highly recommend you get away from the convention center to grab food here, if you can.  Typically once any trade show starts it can get very crowded in here.  So make sure you have time to eat because it will be slow to get seats and your food.   I have eaten here many times. I have also had a few post show drinks here too. I will say that the food is really good and probably the best available food near the convention center.   On a recent trip I was able to sneak in here the day before the trade show started. This is not a common occurrence because I'm usually swamped with work and I never get lunch. So it was really lucky to walk in and find a spot at the bar.   The bartenders were really nice. Natalie and Jamie rocked behind the bar. I had some great conversations with Natalie about making drinks. She was muddling some stuff and I was having some muddling envy. She asked what I was muddling at home. I shared a few recipes and she gave me a few ideas for my current drinks. It was priceless information. I love sharing ideas but on this occasion I believe I learned more. Jamie was also really nice but we weren't really talking drinks. She was pregnant and I'm sure the last thing she wants to talk about is alcohol.   I ordered the Nicoise Salad, which had mixed greens, hard boiled egg, olives and a fresh herb vinaigrette with seared ahi tuna.  First of all I can not pronounce Nicoise. Can we start a petition to have the name of this salad changed? Maybe to something easier like Nice? It's just a thought. I really liked the salad except for the potatoes, which I know are a staple in this salad. The potatoes were really bland and tasteless. I was really glad that I added the Ahi tuna. It was a nice touch. I also got the dressing on the side. I like controlling my dressing because I can not stand a drowning salad.   I have ordered other items here in the past and I have always been happy with my selections. Like I said this place is 100 times better then convention food. So if you happen to be working in the South Hall of the convention center, then take a break and head out for a nice lunch or dinner.",

We each got a glass of the Caricature Red Blend which was a good pairing with the steak. My ribeye bone-in filet was perfectly cooked. The flavor was top notch.

I really hate peanut butter and I have other food allergies to oils so I'm allergic to certain peanut butters. I was too tired to try to fix it and they went out of their way to accommodate me already so I just took a few bites and left them. My husband liked his breakfast. The prices are very high.",

He has an awesome personality, he knows his stuff and he's worked there for a decade. It's obvious that he loves what he does. The main chef also came around to introduce himself and check on the diners. I think I'd go back there because of the wonderful service.  It's a very typical steakhouse: dimly lit, elegant, and pricey. Just like any higher end steakhouses, for $45-65, you only get the meat, any sides are for purchase. And the side dishes for $10-12 are only good for 2. We ordered 8 and 10 oz steaks with peppercorn sauce (any sauce is extra $2), sauteed spinach, the popular creamed corn (which we found just ok), glasses of moscato and chocolate souffle a la mode topped with a ball of choco rice crispies (i thought the crispies was not necessary, maybe the goal was to add texture to the dessert but the souffle and the icecream are fine by themselves). We appreciate that they offered to butterfly the steaks for us = less wait time :) I recommend that you check it out when in Las Vegas, but then, it might be okay to miss it too.",

Like that so food 0 the drinks were good but that goes to the bartender drinks 9.

    "text": "Very good service. Fast and classy. The steak was amazing, so amazing that with each bite it just melted. (New York steak) A little charr, but great portion size. Lobster Mac n cheese was great not overpowering. The mash potatoes were good, a little dry for my taste but maybe better with a side of butter. The side of chimichurri with my girlfriend's steak was a little off. It was a brown sauce that tasted more like a vinaigrette. The alcohol drinks we had were \"The old fashioned and the Cosmopolitan\". The cosmopolitan was great and flavorful. Now this was my first time with an old fashioned.... This drink was very strong at first so \"Be careful\". But good quality alcohol. Desserts were great, the cheesecake was the best. So creamy and the berry sauce was a great addition. The chocolate tart not so much. I'm personally not a great fan of dark chocolate, and this was that. The ics cream on top was a necessity to eat this dessert. Overall our time here was great.   Service 5  Food quality 4 Price 5 \"Fair\"",

But our steaks were horrible and lack flavor or the tenderness you'd hope for. Our flavorless mashed potatoes, sweet corn and flavorless asparagus were pretty cool, but not excellent. The crab cakes were very flavorful. And our drinks were tasty. With the groupon you get either Cheesecake or an all fudge chocolate cake and scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty underwhelming for the type establishment. And to top it off. See photos and how they packaged our to go meals. I've never felt like I was leaving a fast food restaurant when I should've been feeling like I just ordered a $55 steak. The staff was pretty kind which was appreciated. Long story short... I'd never return here again. We feel we wasted $150 which is a disappointment for our trip to Vegas.",

On a Saturday night it was not very crowded which initially gave me pause, but there was no reason to be concerned.   Truly high-quality steak cooked to perfection. Service is excellent. I had the NY top sirloin and it was very memorable among the many steakhouses I have visited. I put it right at the top.   Worked in a few appetizers and side dishes as well. The crab cake appetizer was the only time I have ever had crab outside of the state of Maryland (my original home) and it was done right! How does a completely landlocked state pull this off? We were very impressed.   The asparagus was well-seasoned and the mac & cheese is worth a visit unto itself.   We polished it all off with dessert which was heavenly. I'm a major chocolate fan and the chocolate cake did not disappoint.   Envy is off the beaten path, but close enough to the Strip to make it accessible. In fact, if it's relatively uncrowded like the night we went, you might even enjoy the extra privacy and bask in a truly intimate setting.",

    "text": "2.5 stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to up it to 3.  Honestly, this is a steakhouse trying to be a Mastro's...which I can understand, but it still has some ways to go. Overall, we were all just \"okay\" with our meals, though one of my girls had to send her order back. Let me go over what we had:  Salmon: A bit on the dry side for me, but I can make a killer salmon dish so I may just be picky. The sweet pea puree was for the most part, tasteless with the exception of a grassy (mint-y?) random herb that I picked up randomly from the puree. The peas were nice and fresh though.The pork belly bits under the salmon were overly salty, and it was a bit too much zing on the taste buds to complement the salmon, which was seasoned just right. The puree did help with the dryness, but it shouldn't have been necessary.   Lamb rack: This dish was actually okay, and made just right for the bf. Quality-wise, we've had better for the price, but it was decent.   Bone in: My two friends who ordered steaks were like \"...that's it?\" because presentation-wise, it really was just a slab of meat on a plate. Sure, it's what they ordered, but there was no wow factor at all compared to Ruth Chris or even Houston's. The steaks were definitely edible, but once again, not very melt-in-your-mouth or orgasmic flavor explosion. They were just steaks. Steaks that I could probably make better at home, but eh, we were away so we'll make do.  French onion soup: My friend expected crunchier croutons, but they were actualy incorporated into the soup and made into soggy bread bits along with her measly looking cheese on top. Once again, no wow factor, and even when she got it I could tell she already looked disappointed. However, it was actually way too salty for her and she ended up getting a stomach ache and was sick the rest of the night, so we returned the order.  Truffle fries: Giant, clingy mass of cheese and oil. It didn't look classy for the restaurant at all, and it just looked like a heart attack mess waiting to happen. Granted, the truffle taste was strong and it was tasty, but the mixture of sodium and heavy, heavy grease just made it too hard to eat. We barely scarfed any of it down for fear of just feeling sick from all the fat.  Service was professional and courteous, and they did take the french onion soup off the check and gave us a side of mashed potatoes as the fries were taking a long time to come in, which was nice. Overall though, I don't think I'd pay what I did to be back.",

We ordered the tomahawk chop, lobster mac & cheese and the bourbon creamed corn.   The steak was just ok, a little on the gristly side. My expectations were low, but I had hoped for a little more from the steak. The flavors were a little lacking for me and the steak had a glaze that I found unappealing. The sides were decent. My favorite was the creamed corn, which was sweet and creamy without being watery.  Our server was so attentive and sweet, she really went above and beyond. She even made sure that they presented the entire tomahawk so I could get a picture before they took it back to slice it up for us.   I don't see myself going back any time soon, but it is a decent location close to the convention center.",

We made reservations on OpenTable and if you dine earlier before 6p, they do offer 1000 points, score! Our waiter Joshua was hands down one of the best waiters I have encountered! He explained the menu, and talked about the specials and helped me try to decide what to order and was extremely patient with me.   We got our Envy salad right away, it was no better than the salad I get from Fresh and Easy, dressing tasted like grocery store no name brands. Dislike. The 2 entrees we ordered were the 12oz NY steak, and the seared salmon. The steak was rather small, but it was a quality cut, and seasoned well. It came with their house specialty salts: lava salt, Australian sea salt, and this other smoky infused sea salt from Washington state. My salmon was good, fish was fresh, the sweet pea puree was very bland though, and the pork belly was rather chewy.   Nice place to dine, easy parking, located inside the very elegant Renaissance hotel, mostly business people. Bathrooms are very clean. I would come back for the service and the experience, but can't recommend the food.",

    "text": "Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red decor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.    There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sauteed brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 \"Grand Seafood Plateau\".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.    All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.    I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.    The staff raved about the \"Envy Signature Sea Bass\" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their \"Grilled Pesto Prawns\" and \"Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato\" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a \"steakhouse\" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.         They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a \"Best of LV\" category for \"Steakhouse for people that don't like steak\".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!

Granted, it's off the strip away from the glitz and glamour of the strip and some of the other steak eateries in Vegas, but it's well worth the trip (and there's never a wait for dinner).  This place has the *best* steaks, and they always come perfectly cooked and prepared.  And don't you dare walk out without trying the truffle fries-- they are worth every calorie.",

    "text": "MM!!  I looked up steak places in Vegas before coming, and we decided that this restaurant, being so close to our hotel and getting really good reviews, was a good choice. And boy, am I glad we chose it.  The inside is really quite pretty, dark, warm, and inviting. I loved the decor on the table, a mirror in the center, nice darm placemats, a vase with some flowers, and overall just a great change of scenery. Immediately I was happy.  We started with drinks, and my mojito was perfectly made. Good amounts of fresh lime and mint - I was in love. our meal started with bear - french bread, a delicious white chocolate pecan bread, and these thin little bread sticks. My favorite was the white chocolate pecan bread - it wasn't really all too sweet, and with butter, it was superb. I was starving, but so excited about the meal I didn't eat too much.  We both ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with little fingerling potatoes and foie gras butter. My medium rare was cooked perfectly, was tender, and was a delicious steak. Well seasoned, great quality, and overall just delicious. The demi-glace was a great addition that added taste to the steak and potatoes, but wasn't over powering and didn't drench the meat like some sauces can. It was delicious. We ordered two sides - the bourbon creamed corn and the reggiano truffle fries. Both were great. The addition of Marker's Mark to the creamed corn set it over the top - other wise it would have not been all too special, and perhaps a bit liquidy, but I will overlook that because adding bourbon to creamed corn is brilliant and I will do it from now on in my own recipe. The fries were a HEAPING plate full that looked like we barely dented them. They were thin, crispy, delicious, and sprinkled with delicious cheese and flavorings that just made my mouth water. I loved them. Overall, the entire meal was a great first night in Vegas for our little trip (business, by the way) and really just made for a nice relaxing experience after a long, long day of flying and a convention.",

The wine selection is also very impressive, with bottles available for all types of budgets.  Rounding out the entire experience is the service, I can't say enough good things about the service, friendly and helpful just don't describe how awesome everyone is.

For an appetizer we got the iceberg lettuce salad with blue cheese which was amazing... Then dinner came around and he provided free garlic mash potatoes and Brussel sprouts.. Also various sea salt to go with our meals.. The steak was good but with the salt phenomenal.. The sea bass was amazing by itself! For dessert he gave us a free toffee dessert with a happy birthday written on it! Then finally he gave us two for 1 coupons at the end... This guy was absolutely a model server and we were lucky to be the recipient of his wonderful service!",

However, keep in mind this is a hotel restaurant.  Its main attraction is hotel folks who don't want to head out.  For that audience its a great alternative I'm digging especially on expense account!  Only recommendation is get the steak pure without too many toppings.  It kind of takes away the True steak flava.",

The food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  I really enjoyed the 17oz bone-in ribeye (it comes with a choice of sauce on the side as well as an assortments of flavored salts, none of which are necessary as the steak stands on its own just fine).  The truffle fries are easily large enough to share and worth every penny.  The Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer was better than expected for a steakhouse, and if anything missed, it was our dessert, the Asian Apple Pie, which was a bit awkward to eat and didn't wow me at all.  I think I would try the Cheesecake next time.  Overall, I would definitely return for a nice dinner here or even just drinks in the bar.",

    "text": "Atmosphere-3  Ok here I have a bit of problem.  The colors, decor and overall 'feel' is cozy, a bit romantic,& a bit fancy air.  Here comes the 'but'...Something just doesn't 'feel' right.  I kept thinking of this felt like a cafe to a hotel that was 'trying' to be 'high end'.  So the mood, service and decor speak high end (kinda), but all is teetering on the wall.. so to speak.  I guess with the large variety of places here in Vegas that ARE over the wall 'high end'- Envy just does not match up.  OH, and even though it was probably still 100 degrees last Friday night @ 8p.m., I froze inside this restaurant.  It was so cold my food was warm for just an 'instant' then turned cold also. Prices-2 Because of the atmosphere (which is so ..so important to my overall dining experience) I have to say, this place charges too much.  Yes the food was delicious, service very good...but I did see the valet drive from my 'view' and 2-3 babies screaming and or crying through my entire visit.  (not the fault of this restaurant, so I tried to keep an open mind). Food-4  Nice warm bread to start.  I had the tomato soup (vegan) this was very good, but one bite almost 'warm' rest cold. I had crusted sea bass. A delicious, thick, melt in my mouth treat.  Portion: 'deck of cards double thickness.'  My guy had the sirloin m to m-w his portion similar to my fish.  I did not taste the meat (just trying to go 'no red' for a while) but he said it was like butter and very good.  He did think a return trip for the food would be nice.  Wine, typical strip prices.  But, again, they are NOT ON THE STRIP. Service-4-5 very attentive, polite, professional.  No complaints, top notch. I can't put my finger on it but think it is the 'feeling of front cafe' to a hotel that just does not give me the desire to go back.  At least not at their high prices.  I had $80 Groupon that cost me $40.  My tab was $45. so with tip of $25. I spent $110.   Too much, even with the Groupon.  I really think some of the places here in Vegas are losing site of a comfortable 'price point'.  oh, on my email reservation they ask for any 'special notes': I said Birthday celebration. No mention or special attention to that fact during our visit.",

The restaurant had a nice decor and very good service. Our server was friendly and very personable also.  Appetizers:  Tuna and Crabmeat Dynamite, Black Sesame Seaweed Salad, Yuzu Soy : this dish was alright...eatable but nothing great   Entrees:  Envy Signature rib eye steak: It was very tender and juicy. And tasted very good.   Envy signature Sea Bass: This was an exceptional dish. Loved it.   Sides:  Grilled asparagus with Hollandaise sauce: Very good side dish  Steamed Broccolini: Thsi side dish was ok, nothing spectacular.  Creamed Corn: This dish was also ok. Tasted decent.   Our friends ordered the prix fixe menu for 39 dollars and it looked pretty good. They had the roasted tomatoe soup, 6oz angus filet. and the chocolate lave cake. They looked like they were pretty satisfied.   Beverages: We ordered a bottle of pinot noir and that was pretty good.   Overall it was a great restaurant and priced pretty decent. We had a $ 75 coupon that we got fom <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> so we got that taken off our bill.

The food, service, and entertainment were all excellent, but be sure to make reservations for brunch as they have a group of older regulars who will stay all day. My group of 6 enjoyed Envy from 11a to 2pm, with endless mimosas, bloody Mary bar, smoothie shots, crab legs, omelets, the best cheese blintzes of my life, fruit, salmon, etc. While the buffet itself was not particularly ginormous in the way of Las Vegas, there was plentiful, delicious food and great staff to help with any need you may have.   I don't think I need to say more about the entertainment than that I've never seen an 80+ year old woman put a dollar down a pianist's pants before...",

First off the service by Krisztian was superb.  He picked us out a nice bottle of wine and gave us some recommendations. We absolutely loved all our dishes from appetizers through desert.  We especially loved our entrees which we all shared since it all looked so good.  The Chilean Sea Bass was light, flaky and flavorful. The NY bone in Steaks were cooked perfectly and seasoned great.  It would of been a sin to use sauce on it.  An absolute must have was the Bourbon Cream Corn, try it and you'll love it too.  The lava cake was the best I ever had.  We visited around 6:30 PM and it wasn't too busy and the Chef (Carlos) stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed ourselves.  We would definitely come here again the next time we are in town.",

Must spend $150 to get $75 off. We ordered yellow sashimi & Caesar salad as appetizers. Sashimi was great, salad was so so. Entree I ordered Seabass & hubby ordered ribeye. Both entrees were excellent. For sides we had signature creamed corn & truffle fries. Fries are good but we couldn't finish it, big order. Creamed corn was to die for. Desserts we ordered Giant homemade Oreos & sticky warm pudding. Oreos looked great but missed the mark on taste. Sticky pudding was amazing, we wanted to lick the plate. I had a Belvedere dirty martini $18(yikes) and hubby had 2 side cars from the cocktail menu. After the $75 discount was applied our total bill was $167 including 18% gratuity. Overall our experience was great. It didn't get 5 stars because I thought it was a bit over priced for certain items. Oreos were a fun idea but totally missed on taste.",

Very sensual red colors with varying materials for a relaxed feel, small but original menu, great breakfasts with enough to fill you up, rich dishes.  Had some issues on 1/1/11 with getting the attention of anyone but everyone probably called in sick.   A little pricey but worth it for a special vacation meal; at at the bar outside too which I think is the same kitchen and this was cheaper and still great; smaller steak than expected but still filling.

    "text": "Had dinner here this evening. Sunday night 7pm and the place was very quiet, maybe 5 tables when we arrived and 7 or 8 when we left. We had been here before and really enjoyed our meals. This time, things were not quite up to par. The dining room was staffed with two servers who were also playing host and busser. Both were pleasant and kept busy doing multiple roles. They also appeared to work well together which was nice to see. Both appeared attentive to their respective tables. Our server was great.  She was the star of our evening and the reason this is a 4 star and not a 2 star review. There were two of us and we ordered the Caesar salad, wedge salad, a 10 oz filet for each, the lobster mac and cheese and the asparagus. The salads were fantastic. Crisp, fresh, cold lettuce and nicely portioned. The bread selection that accompanied them had been left to warm somewhere too long and were dry and hard. I'm talking tooth-killing hard - inedible. Of our two identically ordered steaks (10oz fillet, med rare), one was very close to med well and the other was closer to med than med rare. These are $55 steaks and it's disappointing when they can't be cooked correctly. It's also pretty amazing that two identical steaks can't be cooked by professional cooks to the same temp. The asparagus was past its prime, I should have known, the season is done. My bad for even ordering it. The sauce was good, but the stalks were woody. The lobster mac and cheese had two large chunks of lobster. The Mac was overcooked and the sauce lacked flavor and was slightly grainy. Not bad, but not good either. I will say that the last time we were here, we had the corn and it was to die for. We should have stuck with that. Our server noticed that we were not very thrilled with our meals and inquired. She offered to make things right, but we declined. We are not people who send back food. The service was five star and our tip reflected that. On this night, the kitchen talent was severely lacking. Too bad because ambiance-wise, this is a great place for a birthday date night.",

    "text": "The story you are about to read is True. This is the convention center, Las Vegas business at its finest. My name is Skacey, I carry a badge.  6:22 pm, Thursday. I am heading to dinner with my coworkers at Envy, a steakhouse near the glorious Las Vegas convention center. We arrive a bit earlier than some of our companions and decide to enjoy a beverage at the bar while we wait. The bar is a large curve, with high top cocktail tables and chairs arranged in front. Their drink menu is a blend of retro-riche and urban lounge. The wine list is better than average as well. For me, I spot Guinness and decide to try it blind. Bad call on my part as the bottle and glass are set before me. True Guinness only comes from the tap in my book. Service was good, about what I would expect but no better.  Once seated we take a second pass at drinks. There is a bit of debate as one decides to go for a Pisco Sour, while another questions the merit as he has spent time in Peru. The final verdict was a decent try, but not quite there. For me, I switch up to a dirty gin martini, which is highly dependent on the quality of olives. Final verdict, standard bar olives with little taste.  For dinner, we ask about the fish of the day, but after being told, the server returned to let us know that they only had two servings left and were making the switch to scallops. For my meal, I go for the special.  Now, with higher end dining comes higher end expectations. The overall consensus was that the food was good, but not great. My scallops were overcooked and under seared. Light brown crust and somewhat gummy. Not impressive, just average.  Overall - decent, but not unique especially in Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue and I have nothing but great things to say about Envy. I've eaten here about three times with my girlfriend and our friends. Each time we visit Envy,  we're never disappointed because the service is on point, the food is always fantastic and the wine list is amazing. A great experience each and every time and I have the staff at Envy to thank.   Let's talk about seating. In normal restaurants, tables and booths are set up to seat about 4 or 5 people per table/booth. I think we can agree on that. At Envy, every table and booth is set to seat about 6 - 8 people. Well, for people like me who enjoy dining with good company, it means a lot to me that a little detail like this is taken into account of what a good dining experience should be. At the end of the day, it is about how the food tastes but when you get to share with a group of friends, it somehow makes your food taste that much better. Also, it's nice to have all that space so you can keep ordering food and alcohol!  Now, let's get to the food. The bone-in rib-eye is phenomenal. It's huge, a bit pricey, and is cooked to order. I like ordering my meat medium rare because I think the texture and flavor is better when ordered as such. As far as your sides go, don't leave without ordering the truffle-regiano fries and bacon gruyere mashed potatoes. SOOOO EFFFFING DELICIOUS! We order at least two orders of the fries and mashed potatoes because they are pretty damn addicting to say the least and because it really is that damn good.  The staff itself is very accommodating. There were visits where we had to change our reservation from six people to eight... or ten people to seven... and whoever was answering the phone was always so pleasant and easy to deal with. Our waiters were always coming by the table to check on us to refill waters and bread. Gotta love that!  There are plenty of other steakhouses that need to be visited -- like Cut, Del Frisco's, Brand -- but it's nice to know that if shit goes down at any of those places, Envy is always waiting for me.",

    "text": "If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars I would.  Our dining experience last night could possibly be the most amazing one I've ever had.  My husband, Scott, came here with his brothers, dad and uncle back in March and they absolutely raved about it any chance they got.  So when we were planning this trip to Vegas, I was beyond excited to come out and try it.  It most definitely did not disappoint! Here's my breakdown of our dinner last night.  Location: It's not on the strip and I consider that a good thing.  It's not overly crowded like other steak restaurants in Vegas and it's just a short cab ride away to get there.    Bar: We sat down for drinks before we got there waiting for my sister-in-law, Krystle, to arrive from the airport.  Scott and his brother got a couple of standard martinis, but I decided to try something different called the Blue Berrymore, cute name right? It had a great flavor and even had three floating blueberries to top off the drink.  I would have had two but I didn't want to spoil my dinner.  Service: AMAZING!  Our server was Josh, who was apparently the same guy who served my husband and crew back in March and he even remembered Scott when we sat down.  I guess in March, Josh had convinced him to get the bone-in filet and it was one of the best steaks he ever had.  Josh was friendly but not intrusive and shared some great advice on what wine to have with dinner (Frank Family Cab from Napa, which we will now visit b/c of Josh's recommendation).  Then at the end of the night, he surprised us with a visit from Chef Mike who came out and chatted with us for a while.  That was a first for us so it was a very cool experience.    Food: I can't even think of a real word to describe the food I ate but I'll go with scrumtrulescent.  Brian, my brother-in-law, got the standard filet mignon and he basically inhaled the entire thing and barely had enough room for the sides he ordered.  Scott got the bone-in ribeye with the spicy chipotle Gorgonzola sauce and he loved it.  Krystle and I  both got the petite filet from the specialties list which came with a Foie Gras butter and fingerling potatoes and a side of Bearnaise sauce.  The steak was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth when you ate it.  The butter added some flavor but it also had some crispy onions on top which I loved.  But the star of the show was the delicious potatoes and I have no idea what it was cooked it but I never wanted to stop eating them.   I'm a \"save the best for last\" type of eater so I left myself a piece of steak and a couple of potatoes to indulge in after I finished everything else.  Oh right, there were other things on the table.  We had the asparagus with hollandaise, which was great, and even Krystle, who is not a fan of hollandaise sauce enjoyed them.  And we also had the bourbon creamed corn that Josh recommended and they were also delicious. As stuffed as we were, Josh and Chef Mike had a surprise dessert for us and brought out their chocolate cake with ice cream and creme brulee.  Both desserts were phenomenal, but the chocolate cake was to die for.  Scott and Brian never eat dessert but they both loved that cake.  It was such a treat to have them send out those desserts complimentary for us.  A perfect ending for an amazing dinner.  Price:  The steaks are priced standard like most other restaurants, but we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon and it saved us $100.  When you use those coupons it automatically charges 18% gratuity, which Josh informed us about, though we already knew.  It was nice, though, that he was honest with us.  We did give him more b/c of the amazing service and the meal.  All in all, the price was totally worth the meal.  If you've made it to this part of the review, thanks for sticking with it b/c I know I was detailed about it.  But since it was the best meal I've ever had, I had to make sure to document it fully.  This was an experience I will remember throughout my life!",

    "text": "So we got into Vegas and headed straight for Renaissance, where we were staying, to check in.  Needless to say, after the drive out from LA, the girl and I were STARVING.  \"Aren't you always?\" you might ask.  Well yes, I am always hungry, thanks for pointing that out!  \"Douche,\" I mutter under my breath.  So we were thinking about meeting some friends for dinner, but decided to just take care of it ourselves.  Envy was on the first floor of the hotel, looked nice, and upon further review it had received pretty good ratings on Yelp.  I called downstairs for a reservation, although upon our arrival it appeared unnecessary... there were only three or four other tables occupied.  The server was very friendly, although she seemed disappointed when we told her that we intended to share a plate.  Let's see, we're in Vegas, we're going to go dancing, and the girl is showing off her midriff... not a great time to be downing a steak apiece.  Perhaps you'll get a smaller tip, but come on, give us a break.  Ambiance was very nice, with deep rich red color palettes and big comfortable booths that are raised up on platforms.  I will also give particular kudos to the steak knives... they were sweet...  We opted for cocktails instead of wine, since we knew that wine would put us to sleep.  The cocktails were large and stiff, as they should have been... not terribly overpriced either.  First they brought out a basket of fresh bread, which was delicious.  I had an olive roll (a personal favorite), and the olive flavor was strong and fantastic but not overpowering.  I mean come on, olive bread with butter?  Doesn't get much better than that.  We split the Envy Signature prime bone-in ribeye ($42), which was a good piece of meat, if a little fatty (even for ribeye which tends to be fatty in and of itself), but it was cooked pretty perfectly (we ordered medium rare but it came out a little medium around the edges).  Oh, and they did charge us a $5 split-plate fee.  We also ordered two sides: the truffle mashed potatoes ($11) and the bourbon creamed corn ($8).  The mashed potatoes were a very tasty compliment to the steak, plus I love truffles (who doesn't?).  While I'm not as obsessed with creamed corn as the girl, it was indeed the best creamed corn I have ever had... the bourbon flavors melded perfectly.  Both of these are highly recommended, although the truffle fries looked excellent as well.  All in all, I'm going 4 stars.  I've been to better steakhouses, but this is a legitimate option, and I would prefer to patron the smaller restaurants as opposed to the chains (although Envy was downstairs in our hotel, we were also within walking distance of Mortons and Lawrys).  Service was good, food was good, prices were reasonable for Vegas (about $120 with cocktails and tip, although that was for a split portion), portions were large (even in splitting we were both uncomfortably stuffed) ambiance was nice.  I'd go back...",

The best creamed corn I have ever tasted.  Ever!  (better than Lawry's....shhhh you didn't hear me say that!)  *Bacon and Gruyere Mac & Cheese. One word....WOW!  Drink: *Bottle of Red S. Australian wine.  Perfect.  The only complaint we had was that we knew we would fill up fast.  We both slapped our tummies and psyched them into a few extra bites.    Food = great.   Decor = beautiful and comfortable  Service =  unpretentious  TIPs:   1. If you cab it here, make sure to get his card so you can call him to pick you up.  There's not much activity here so set up your ride beforehand.    2. Check out Restaurant.com's site and sign up for their emails.  They had a sale over the weekend for 80% off so you can score a $75 GC for $6!  Who can say no to that?",

    "text": "I rolled into Vegas late one night and arrived at the Renaissance Hotel.  My companion and I debated where we should eat and finally settled on Envy for two reasons:  it was There and it was Easy.    We weren't expecting much.  Wow...were we surprised!  We were seated at a large booth surrounded by lusty red and brown tones.  A single red rose head beckoned from a square, glass vase.  Candles glittered and set a romantic tone.  Too bad I was there on business!  We began the meal with a half bottle of an Estancia Meritage and split the Caesar salad.  We then went on to devour perfectly prepared filet mignons, truffled mac and cheese and port wine mushrooms.  It was sheer heaven!  The flavors were robust and delicious!  We also had several choices of how to have our meat prepared.  I chose to have mine charred on the outside, red on the inside.  My companion had her filet in a Bearnaise sauce.  Both were excellent.  Then it was time for dessert.  Since we couldn't settle on just one, they made it easy for us with the Chef's trio.  We had miniature versions of the New York cheesecake with raspberry sauce, cappuccino mousse and a chocolate souffle cake.  We paired these with a chocolate port and an ice wine.  The restaurant was kind enough to also give us a complimentary glass of Sauternes.  They knew the way to our hearts!   We left Envy feeling elated.  It was complete food euphoria!    When we came back a couple of weeks later, we immediately put in our reservation for the first night we were there.  Envy has become one of our \"must dine\" places in Vegas.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to ENVY in August to celebrate our anniversary while in Las Vegas. We had found them on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> and figured they were worth a try. We were definitely in for a treat.  The menu is solid: a good selection of steaks and other fare. Entrees are served with family-style portions of delightfully garlicy mashed potatoes and nicely flavorful roasted vegetables. The meal also came with a tray of specialty salts to try on our bread and our entrees - a really nice touch that brings the meal up a notch. When you order a steak, you're given a choice of one of their signature sauces. They range from traditional to more interesting options.  The quality of our meal was excellent. The steaks were perfectly cooked, the sides were fantastic, and to top it all off, the waiter gave us each a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate our occasion.  I highly recommend heading off the strip to dine at this oft-forgotten restaurant. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "After having a reservation at Ruths Chris go bad on us, THEY CLOSED without notice, we came upon Envy a few blocks away. An incredible experience. The food was excellent, steaks just you like them. The waiter, busboy, and other personnel, were courteous, helpful, and extremely personable. The Asian touch on some of the dinner/dessert choices was superb and unexpected. I would recommend this restaurant anytime when you are in Las Vegas, which has its fair share of steakhouses, but this one took the prize.",

    "text": "Best. Mushrooms. Ever.  Seriously, the mushrooms in wine here are amazing, best either myself or my bf has ever had.  Back to the rest of the meal.  The cabernet that I ordered was delicious, bf didn't order a drink this meal.  He ordered a blue cheese and tomato salad that he inhaled, and I had fois gras with raspberry and rhubarb chutney.  Second course, he had the bone-in ribeye and I had the petit filet.  Both were cooked to their perfect and respective temperatures.  We ordered the side of mushrooms and garlic mashed potatos, yum!  I ordered the honey creme brulee, and it was also delicious.  This is one of the best steakhouses that I've ever been to.  The service was a little over-attentive, and that they were trying too hard (the restaurant was only about 1/4 full).  It didn't bother me or the bf too much as the food more than made up for the hammy behavior.",

    "text": "Sadly they've changed the menu.  The \"signature\" bone-in ribeye is no longer. It's just a Bone-in Ribeye, a couple of ounces lighter than previously for $45. In fact, ALL the steaks are $45! Garlic mashed potatoes and vegies come with the entree, and there are no substitutions, so that kind of kills ordering the wonderful truffle fries. It's just not the same, and it's not an improvement.  Alas....Envy, I'll miss ya.",
