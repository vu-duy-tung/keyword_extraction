Other than those minor criticisms this is a good place to grab some yummy Mediterranean grub.",

    "text": "I eat at Stephanos about once a week & the food is really good. I normally order a Greek salad with traditional dressing which is wonderful. Watch out for the olives in this salad though! They are not pitted, and I nearly broke a tooth biting into one. I also occasionally order the Greek grilled cheese which is really original! It's cheesy goodness grilled in between two pitas.   I normally have a pretty decent experience as far as customer service goes, but my most recent visit left a very bad impression. I ordered a Greek salad to go. When I got home I realized they had forgotten to give me any dressing (the dressing is the best part in my opinion). I called the restaurant and waited 15 minutes for someone to answer the phone. After no one answered I eventually hung up. I figured the restaurant was probably busy, so I ended up driving back to pick up the missing salad dressing. When I finally got back, the restaurant was dead. Only 2 couples were seated and had already finished eating. There was no reason that they did not answer the phone. When I got to the cash register, the girl working barely acknowledged me. When I finally got her attention I asked if I could please get some dressing as it had been forgotten in my take out order. She sort of just tossed the dressing at me and turned away. No apology and a super big attitude.   As I stated before, I eat here about once a week. After this experience, however, I will most likely not come back to Stephanos.",

The good first: the hummus was out of this world great and they gave me two full-sized pita breads to enjoy it with.  I don't often leave bread uneaten, but these were two good-sized pieces of pita and I just couldn't finish them, even with the outstanding hummus.  But I came for the gyro meat, because it looked so good on the website and the reviews.  It looked moist and freshly cut off the spit.  Unfortunately, the reality this night in Las Vegas was that it was bone dry and frankly a little burnt while trying to reheat it.  Yuk!  I've had much better gyro meat from street vendors!  Service was good and friendly but someone was cutting corners and trying to use yesterday's gyro meat to serve today's customers.  Again, yuk!",

They have some good deals for students! Gyro bowl with white or wheat pita and a drink or even the typical gyro wrapped in pita with fries and a drink both just for $10 for students! They have great fries!! (I love good fries)  The serving size is decent and I usually take about half of it to-go because I can never finish it. So it's almost like two meals for $10 which is a good deal for us students!  I haven't had anything bad so far, even the baklava was delicious! It was a check-in deal either on 4square or yelp (I don't remember) but I wanted to try it and now almost always get one when I order with them!   They have a good seating area and the back has pretty comfy seats as opposed to the regular dining area with normal chairs.   Free WiFi is always a plus!  It's not usually busy, but when they do get busy, the food comes out just as fast!  Always a good place for something quick and cheap if you're a student. I come here generally twice a month.",

This place was flavorful, everything was fresh, price was decent, lots of seating area, the only down side...it's 20 minutes away from where I live!    I love their chicken!  It has the grilled taste/flavor that you need in chicken at places like these.    Their beef/lamb schwerma was super good!  It's actually legit and sliced off piece by piece from a large piece of meat!  Unlike some other places who use prepacked meat (cough I won't mention who).  Honestly, if you're gonna open a greek restaurant and want people to enjoy their food, don't get that nasty prepacked stuff they use at fairs...Just my two cents.    Their side dishes were also very good!  I got a vegetable salad as a side to accompany my combo plate of chicken, beef/lamb, I was satisfied!  It was so good that I couldn't finish it and wanted to save it for dinner so I can enjoy it again! haha.    Also, if you have room for more food, grab a baklava for dessert at this place!  Great flavors and texture!  you won't be disappointed....unless you get a allergic reaction to honey ;-)    I'd recommend this place to anyone craving great Greek food!",

Cut in half and stuck together, I really couldn't use it to make a falafel pita.  This is the first order-at-the-counter establishment I have been to that use those little vibrating coasters to tell you when your order is ready.  Good idea, no yelling out numbers or mispronouncing someone's name. But the damn thing scared the crap out of me!  The food took a lot longer to come out than I thought it would, but the light and fluffy falafel was worth the wait.  I'll be back to try more dishes, including the vegetarian moussaka, which I find intriguing. Maybe I just got a bad batch of pita.",

I wanted to try them out for awhile (5 years to be exact) since I had heard such good things and finally did and unfortunately can see why I didn't rush eating here. I originally planned on ordering a falafel, but I wanted something that was a bit more filling and I didn't think a vegetarian option would do the trick so I ordered the gyro fries. I was expecting a bit more, but all I got fries with the meat on top and the sauce on the side... Really? I was expecting tomato and lettuce, kind of like how carne asada fries are made. Good thing I ordered it to go because I came home and definitely shredded some lettuce and chopped some tomatoes and it sure did make it 10 x better. The free baklava with Yelp check-in is delicious and I ate it even before my order was ready. Flaky and sweet, just how I like it which is probably the best baklava I've ever had.  The meat and sauce was good, but next time I'll probably just get the gyro and I'm sure I will be pleased. Although this is a fast food type of place, the inside is pretty classy and is decorated like a sit down restaurant.",

Once I was able to get the meat off the skewers without a hacksaw, I found the chicken tasty, but somewhat dry. The steak was a bit stringy for my taste. Both were cooked almost to the point of cremation. The accompanying rice was pasty, not fluffy, and the cucumber and tomato salad was so vinegary, it made my taste buds ache. There was hummus on the side which I guess was good, but I'm not really a big fan of hummus. And even though the tzatsiki sauce was pretty good, I'm not sure it will lure me back!",

    "text": "Travelling from Hawaii, I read good things about this place and also got a good deal on it. Although Vegas had just been hit by the 'North Winds' and temperatures dropped to 50 degrees with 30 mph winds, I wanted to get my Greek fix and visit neighboring UNLV. I had my menu items picked out weeks in advance, so I stepped up and ordered.  Hummus side- 3 1/2-stars- The hummus as clean, basic and creamy. Obviously, you get a nice layer of olive oil on top. This comes with a steaming back of pita bread, wrapped warm and tight. I'd consider this a good compliment to any dish. But, if you're ordering a plate with hummus or been-there-done-that, I'd recommend baba ganoush as another option.  Feta with Olives side- 4-stars- A beautiful, briny dish also served with it's own batch of pita bread. (I hear the wheat pita is the best, as one man exclaimed.) The huge, purplish Kalamata olives are so sweet and salty, with very small seeds. It was just a satisfaction biting into these. The feta was also brisk and briny. It was almost too much salt for one dish, but eating them with a pita helped to spread the distinct flavors out a little.  Falafel Plate- 4-stars- Served with five falafels, the spices hit you immediately. The falafel were a little drier, yet also crispier than I've been accustomed to. There is a light coating of tzatziki to add some moisture. The Israeli salad is a mixture of cucumber, tomato, onion, and cilantro almost like a salsa. Amazingly, the flavor and freshness reminded me of a lomi lomi in Hawaii (without the seafood obviously). My suggestion, as you also get pitas with this plate--add the salad into the pita, then pack on some hummus to keep all the loose pieces together. Throw on the falafel last, then enjoy the mixture of flavors as they hit your taste-buds. The plate is huge, and all three was more than enough to stuff me beyond capacity. Yet, I didn't feel weighed down, which is a good thing. Healthy and delicious!  Atmosphere- The set-up is very open and casual, with light music playing in the background. Check out the seats in the rear of the restaurant if you want a more intimate feel while you're eating--with pillows, etc. rather than wooden seats. The decorations are light, but there is a nice bookshelf dedicated to the beers they carry. Wi-fi is also available, yet secured, so I guess you gotta ask for the password--there was no info on the receipt nor the buzzer they give you with your order. I did find it amusing, there was sriracha sauce available as a hot sauce. I don't know if it's made it all the way to Greece, or the local clientele just loves it, but sriracha is definitely a good, comforting sign of discriminating tastes.  Service- Service is very casual and friendly. You do get a buzzer when your order is ready, and it's picked up on the side window away from where you make your order. Beyond this, you don't really speak to the servers.  Conclusion- Definitely a quiet, humble place, just a hop-skip-and-a-run across the street from UNLV. It seems to attract both student and staff, especially with the variety of options between beer and wi-fi and sriracha (still amazed to see this sauce there). It does lack some excitement and pizzazz, but I'm sure that comes in often enough from the front doors.",

I can't vouch for the taste as I did not have any but my counterpart said it was great and it smelled amazing.  Grilled Nutella Pita:  $3.95 - I would have paid $6.00 for this.  Need I say more?  How can anything with Nutella be bad?  Free baklava - with a Yelp check-in.  This too was great - and I'd definitely order it the next time.

    "text": "This is for 3.5 stars. I really wanted mediterranean food and since this is on the way home from work, I stopped here on friday night for takeout. I ordered the chicken schewarma pita sandwich and two pieces of falafel (@ 99 cents each). The guy at the counter was cordial but not enthusiastic, kinda felt like he was getting through the last part of the day. I waited for my food; it was a short wait. There were two other parties in the dining area, which was nice. From the outside, it looks really small, but on the inside, it's a square-shaped space, and nicely decorated. Located across from UNLV, in the largest strip mall, with various other restaurants such as the Lunchbox. Another customer for takeout was behind me. I noticed that for yelpers who check-in, you get a free piece of baklava. If you're a UNLV student, you get a free drink when you show your ID.   I went home and couldn't wait to devour it. I let my husband have a bite of each (he's on a weight maintenance plan) and he liked it. He's never had this type of food. I did like the food- the pita was soft, the tahini sauce tasted good, but the chicken tasted like it was charred (think charcoal), and I couldn't shake it. I've been particularly sensitive lately to certain things, maybe it was an off day, I don't know. I really wanted to like this place. I thought it was me. And when I had the falafel, I also got the same charred taste, but I also noticed that it was slightly burned, too. My favorite place for mediterranean is all the way in Summerlin (Sultan's Grill), which is far away from our area, so I thought I'd try a convenient place. I would try this place again, maybe get a plate next time. Plus, my husband's never had mediterranean food so it be worth trying again.",

    "text": "I came to Stephano's wanting to fulfill a gyro craving, which was satisfied! Located right across the university, this Greek/Mediterranean spot is delicious. I ordered the Beef & Lamb Gyro & made it a meal with fries, which came with a complimentary fountain drink because I was a student. It was around lunch time when I went & it wasn't too busy, but people started arriving shortly after.   I had heard of the place & it had always came up on my yelp when I looked for gyros, hummus or shawarmas so decided to check it out.   The fellow that took my order was friendly & so was the one who gave me my order.   The menu had a variety of items to choose from, from baba ganoush to all types of hummus & Mediterranean dishes & as much as I wanted to try all of them I just wanted a gyro. They had lunch specials as well at good prices.   My gyro was delicious & the meat was juicy & tender. I am not a big fan of lamb, but most gyros are mixed with beef & lamb so it was pretty good. I love fries & fry sauces & Stephano's serves their fries with a killer fry sauce that's tangy & compliments their seasoned fries well.   All in all I would return because to try their falafel sandwich.",

    "text": "I couldn't eat the food from the taco place a few doors away (food allergy)so I went outside and started walking the strip mall looking for food!  Well, it was one of the BEST walks I've taken in awhile looking for food.  I walked into Stephano's checked out their menu, prices, and cleanliness.. I was hooked before I ordered/ate! Fresh quality food without a bunch of additives.  The food at Stephano's is amazing.  Freshly prepared,  reasonably priced, a lot of food for your money, and most of all A-1 customer service!  Very clean restaurant. The manager (Ron) is awesome!  He was very nice and accommodating to customers.. Even when he was dealing with an extremely rude customer., he kept his cool and went above and beyond to please.  OK, back to the food - I ordered the steak salad.  It came with hummus, pita, and chopped tomato salad tossed in a tasty dressing.  The steak was  flavorful and tender.. The lettuce wasn't wilted, but crisp and fresh. The hummus was delicious as well.  AND THE PITAS ARE HOMEMADE.. I had the wheat pitas.  Very, very good!  My son and husband walked from the taco place and found me inside Stephano's.  My son couldn't resist ordering the pita w/Nutella.  He was a happy guy.  His smile told me how good it was, therefore I took a little bite.. I will order it myself next visit!  It's sinfully delicious!  Two homemade pitas w/nutella spread inside!  Hot off the grill dusted with powder sugar. Big portion and only $3.99.  BTW, I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday.  I mentioned it to Ron.. He gave me a FREE piece of baklava.  Totally unexpected.  I ate it later in the day.. BEST BAKLAVA I've ever had!",

What I found odd was how awful the hummus was. Maybe we got a bad batch or they just like to add construction paper to the recipe?",

At least the woman at the counter took the order, rang it up and passed it on to the cook, and did so efficiently and pleasantly.  The decor is nothing special.  I had the falafel pita with fries--the falafel needed to be a bit more spicy, the dressing needed to be more tart and mint-laced, and the fries were those nasty ones with faux crispy coating.  I don't like any fries that aren't identifiably real potato and nothing more.  Unless I find some place substantially better to satisfy my occasional falafel cravings, I'll return.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst Mediterranean places I've been to.I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to Jerusalem Grill on Flamingo and Decatur. Now that place knows how its done, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet. I swear coming from back east and Europe, people don't really know what good food is around here. Best Mediterranean place I've tried thus far here in this town!",

I first went to it what like 10 years ago when it was Daily Chicken... at that time I thought hey a place across from campus (UNLV) that's not fast food.... that was when I got hooked on their chicken with the garlic dip... YUM!!! Since then I've gone over the years.... the place is now called Stephanos... family owned... which I like since my family owns a business in town too... awesome decor when you walk in... you order at the counter..... and they give you a pager letting you know your foods ready.... its a nice little spot to hang out, have some great food and even some hookah... I myself love hookah and this this place makes the best hookahs in town.... they also have wi-fi so you can find me hanging out doin some homework with friends while having a good meal... the food speaks for itself... everything i have tried has been great! i luv luv luv the fries too!!!!  all in all, this is a great comfortable spot that really has some excellent food at a great atmosphere!!!",

    "text": "For late lunch on a Saturday afternoon, a friend and former UNLV student suggested Stephano's. I loved that their menu had pictures as I am a visual person and I am horrible with food names. I had the rib eye steak shwarma combination that came with a side of fries. The shwarma was alright. The meat was a little on the dry side, but the other ingredients compensated for it. Their fries are excellent! I love crispy fries, and these were oh-so-crispy. They also have this cucumber dipping sauce that is really good with the pita bread. Another thing that I must mention is that Stephano's has a lot of different imported beers in their fridge. We tried at least 8 different beers, and they were around $3/bottle. They seriously have a lot of beer to choose from. We just stuck with the lower-priced ones. As for the environment, Stephano's was spacious, even on a Saturday. A few people came in to smoke hookah in the back. They have space reserved for that. All in all, this is a cool place. I'll keep it in mind if I'm ever craving Greek/Mediterranean in Vegas.",

They were very generous on the amount of protein in their gyros; I remember seeing it all wrapped up, and being a little bummed because it looked a touch small (what? I was starved..) but when I picked it up it felt like a brick in my hand. Much more filling than it appeared.   Fries with Herbed Feta: the fries I had were heavenly; golden and crispy on the outside- just to give it a little bite. The feta was plentiful- I hate it when I order Greek fries and my cheese is microscopic. I thought it was strange that it was served with the \"special\" fry sauce- I've never been to a Mediterranean restaurant that served fry sauce. I typically love the stuff, but the fries were great solo.   Service: really awesome. I was at the counter, unsure of weather I wanted to try the pilaf or the fries.. I love me some rice pilaf.. The cashier was super nice and talked me through both; I really like when the employees seem to take pride in the food they serve.   PROS: Lots of meat. As much extra sauce as you'd like. Free. Good food. Even better service.  CONS: If there were any, this wouldn't be a 5-star place, now would it?",

I had a lamb and beef gyro which was very tasty! It was also pretty packed with meat so no worries there. I think avocado with their gyro would have made it the best ever! I did receive a free baklava for checking in here, so that's a big plus. I was quite let down by the fact that they no longer serve the Nutella pita, I wish I'd known. I opted for buying 2 more baklava before I left to satisfy my sweet tooth. I'm sure I'll eat here again, although I'd still love that Nutella pita! Now where can I find a one in Vegas? Help!",

    "text": "Oh boy! Do I love this joint.  My go to place to dine by UNLV based on very simple restaurant principles (Affordability, customer service and delicious food)   Its located in the plaza in front of the UNLV student union.  Cafe rio, wells fargo and Einsteins bagels are the main landmarks to identify this location  Service: You're greeted with a warm welcome by the guy behind the counter.  Patient and willing to explain any of the dishes and the different sauces you can get.    UNLV students:  Get a free drink, just show them your rebel card  Yelpers: Check in for their baklava! Rich and flaky, a delicious treat that shouldn't be skipped  Food:  The food here is tasty.  Hot, packed with flavor of the Mediterranean and  with good portions.  I always get the chicken shawarma bowl which comes in a pie container filled with rice, chicken pieces.  Served with 4 pieces of hot HOT pita (white or wheat) and israeli salad (which you can substitute for fries or hummus).  You get so much when you order which is great, everyone wants to leave a restaurant full.  It also comes with tahini sauce (sesame seed paste) which is amazing.  Combined with the amazing forces of Garlic, this sauce is amazing with the chicken shawarma.   Add some pickled jalapenos, it makes the bowl even better.   Overall, Guy I love this place.  A place of honest food, Stephanos on Maryland should be experienced by all.   **They have a new location in Henderson and honestly the food tastes much better at this location",

Good middle eastern food with UNLV specials, Stephano's gives that free drink with plates or sandwiches with a side dish.  They have a frequent diner card so the 10th trip is free.  I am partial to the kofte sandwich lately, and I have always been a big fan of the lentil rice with caramelized onions as a side dish.  The falafel is decent when I really crave it, but I try to avoid majorly fried food if I can.  The plates are good to get if you are super hungry, because they include meat (gyro, chicken or beef) and onions, tomatoes, pita, tzatziki, and Israeli salad.  Another big plate is the Vegetarian plate, and it comes with spanokopita, hummus, tabouli, dolmas, falafel....so it is quite huge.  The other thing I like is the tropical iced tea here.  Big screen TVs, huge couches, and yummy food make this place a convenient stop for lunch.",

One person was taking her time packing to go food, and person was doing walking around the kitchen doing something that I can't remember but, the phone continually rang and eventually she picked it up despite the growing line almost out the door. We were done ordering after almost 5 minutes of waiting. No acknowledgement or anything.  Our lunch break is one hour and it took 5 minutes to order and 20 minutes to get our gyro wrap (comes with free drink) & small feta fries. We were given number 43, but yet when it was done number 45 was called out so we had to ask them to make sure it was mistake.   Gyro wrap was salty, it comes with beef and lamb but I couldn't tell if there was any beef in there. The meat tastes the same to me throughout the entire wrap. Definitely finish your feta fries in the restaurant. It doesn't taste good after a few hours.  Prices here are a bit higher than say parsley modern, which charges about 7-8 for a wrap and 9-10 for a plate. However they don't offer free drinks with wraps or plates like stephanos. If I were to come back, I would probably call in an order. Make sure you call extremely early because itll take a while for them to pick up.",

The meat seasoned very well. The fries tasty & crispy just the way I like it. The secret fry sauce was an added bonus. The Tzatziki sauce was on point. The Baklava was a nice sweet treat.

Feta Cheese Fries were super delicious! YUMMMMM, i'm biased though because im obsessed with Feta. Their fry sauce is really good, actually -- and the thing is, they never charge for extra sauces here. Which is DOOOOOPE. Not like some places where they charge you extra for everything.  So I've decided I'm not a fan of Hummus, but I guess if I was, their's would be good. It was in my Pita Wrap so maybe I'll just ask them to hold off on that next time. Their steak was perfectly cooked, and I got a size of Tzatziki sauce to dip my wrap in.. made it even more yummmz. I did get this delivered to me, so by the time I got to it, with all the hummus, the pita was a little soggy/drenched in hummus. I'll probably try a plate meal next time.",

I was greeted upon entering the door and since it was my first time, the individual at the register was quick to give suggestions of the most popular items.  The food overall was pretty good. The fries were fresh and the schwarma had a unique blend of spices that stood out from the other Greek restaurants in the area. The meat was a little dry however, but not dry enough to ruin the overall experience. I would strongly recommend this place for lunch.",

When you first walk in you order at the cash register, and then you pick your food back up at the front after a few minutes. They had a larger beer selection than I had anticipated which was a nice touch! I got the steak and lamb gyro, and both were \"de-lish!\" The steak was very tender (unlike many places I've been; where the steak can be quite tough), and the lamb was crisp on the outside and still tender inside.  Both cuts of meat had good flavor, and I loved the \"mixed veggies/salad\" that came with the plate!. You also get rice, pita (I chose whole wheat) and yummy hummus! The portion sizes were also good too, so I had plenty left over for dinner! I'd say... \"Try it!\"",

The whole menu looks good and I would definately go again..staff was very friendly.",

    "text": "This is my first review, so be kind. :-P  I have eaten at Stephano's many times throughout my life as a student at UNLV, and what a long time that has been... (hell, I remember when this place was called the Daily Chicken). It has remained a consistently good lunch venue especially if you are craving something something different from the typical lunch staples around the university (namely, Chipotle, Cafe Rio, Einstein Bagels and others) at a very reasonable price. On top of this it has a pleasant ambiance making it a great place to relax and talk after a filling lunch.    I typically get the gyro combo which comes with a gyro, fries, and a soda. I have not tried many other things on the menu, but as I usually go with friends and they seem pretty satisfied with their selections, I can say that there are at least some other good choices available. (There is a student special similar in price to the gyro combo but is instead a bowl with meat, rice, and vegetables).   The amount of food for the price, which comes to under $9 for this particular meal, is very good and the food is received fairly promptly. The gyro has gyro meat (beef and lamb), tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce all in good proportions. The fries are crispy and go well with the gyro. Overall the meal is a great deal and quite delicious.  Of course there are better Mediterranean places in Las Vegas, both near and far from the university, but for the price and convenience, this is definitely a great place to eat at! Enjoy!",

I'm not a True fan of Greek fare, but when I am in the mood for it, this place is the stop I'll make.  First, it's easy to order, well priced, and they have a lot of dishes you wouldn't normally see at the other Mediterranean places.What they do have that others serve is done well.  Their pita is soft and chewy, the meats are well seasoned and delish, and their sauces (yogurt, hummus, etc.) taste fresh and served in generous portions.  The gyro I ordered could honestly feed two people or one hungry big guy.  I'm a big girl myself and I couldn't eat the entire thing.  They keep their gyro's simple, too--onion, cucumber and the sauce.  Done.  I love that.  Want to Greek out?  Head here for some nummies and bring an empty stomach.  They do take out, too.",

I'll keep looking, but I'm not optimistic.   If someone were to open a Zankou in Las Vegas, there would be lines around the block.

I haven't really tried to much else on their menu with the exception of the baklava which is pretty good as well. I have heard good things about the evenings their as they serve hookah and the place turns into some hookah lounge kind of thing. Can't really say much about this place outside of lunch time.

    "text": "Stephano's is a hard place to find. It is a bit back from the road in a strip mall across from UNLV on Maryland Parkway. If you know where the Post Office is in the 4600 block of Maryland Parkway you are just a few feet away. Just look a bit to the left for the sign above the door. When you walk in you see the counter to order and pick up your food and a few dozen tables for seating. Their sign says that they have been open since 1998. I asked Stephano's son if they have been in the same location since 1998 and he informs me yes. They did expand in 2006 by renting out the space next to them though. I would not say there is much in the way of decor. There are just tables to sit at and not much more.  For my first time there I decided to go with the Rib Eye Steak Shawerma Sandwich. This comes wrapped in a Pita with the steak, tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce. The combo also included fries and a drink. I thought the steak was prepared very nicely. It was full of flavor, very tender and chewed well. I was very impressed with the pita that enclosed the sandwich. This is not like any pita I have ever had before. Most other pita I have had in the past has been mostly like other bread. This pita was dense, very flavorful and had a whitish tint to it. It also had a nice char on it from the grill. I have never had tahini sauce before. I found out that it is a paste made from sesame seeds. It is very smooth, but does not have a lot of flavor. The smoothness did add a pleasing texture to the sandwich as a whole. The fries were nice and crispy. They had a great flavor to them as well.",

Happened twice during our order... then our buddy got his food in a couple minutes and me and my wife waited for almost a half hour for ours to come out. I actually had to go searching for someone, when I walked up to the kitchen, there was no one there... pretty sure a smoke break was taken in the middle of our food being made. Not ok. When they realized it they had to ask us what we had ordered and then he gave us an extra baklava for the trouble. Not really sure I'd want to go back with places like Kabob Grill around... WAY better customer service for about the same quality Med food.",

Everything was light and fresh.  The gyro meat was grilled to perfection.  The restaurant was very clean and tasteful.   The only downside is it proximity to the collage which can make getting out of the parking lot difficult at times.  I also wish the gyro had come with feta but truthfully it wasn't needed.",

My problem with this place is that they tend to skimp on food, it's priced on the higher side for what you get and usually don't have 1/2 a chicken (which is their best deal and tastiest dish). I've been here about 6 times now and each time I have to settle for something I don't want because they don't have anymore or they need cook some more and that would take over 30 minutes.   Today I tried to be smart and call in ahead of time to order this scarce and sacred dish. But once again I'm disappointed. No one answered. So I figured whatever I'll try my luck again. Sadly even more disappointed when the lady at the counter once again rejected my desire to have this elusive Stephano's chicken. Pissed off I went to In and Out instead where they don't disappoint.",

They have some pretty awesome combos that looked really tempting but I really wanted to get the Spanakopita (Spinach Pie). However the Spanakopita combo came with 2 stuffed grape leaves and I wanted to try the kofta (ground beef) instead so I ordered them separately. You also get a free piece of baklava for checking in on yelp!   The Spanakopita was disappointing. I've had really good spanakopita before and this was just average. it was too much dough and the dough was very crispy instead of flaky. The Kofta was good though. I regret not getting a Kofta combo or gyro instead. I would've liked to try the hummus side dish. Next time I suppose! The baklava was a nice sweet little treat after my meal!",

I never use them because who knows who has touched them - but I always sit back here. I enjoy unique things and I it isn't often you see seating like this. Weirdly enough when I went here today for lunch it was pretty full but no one was back here, so it also felt secluded so we could talk.   I got a gyro bowl, which is basically: rice, Israeli salad, and lamb. Pita comes on the side and I got a free baklava for checking in on Yelp, sweet! I could have got a gyro plate which comes with all the same things minus rice, but I really love the Israeli salad and you get more of it in the bowl. I ordered a side a fries which would normally come with a gyro - so basically what I am saying is I overate. As usual my eyes are larger than my stomach.   Conviently located across from UNLV, I have been here several times before and I am sure I will be back again.",

Mediterranean fare was what we had agreed upon and because I am one of the few people without a smart phone I had to rely on my car's GPS for a food search. I had the shwarma  salad and it was delish. They also had deals for college students and free baklava with check in. There was also a pickled turnip bar, which I absolutely love. All in all this is a wonderful little place and refreshing as opposed to eating all the franchise junk on the strip. Definitely would return to if I am ever in Vegas.",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst Greek/ Mediterranean places I've been to. Very few places out here really know how to make authentic Greek/ Mediterranean food. The first time I went here I got severe food poisoning from the chicken schwarma plate, most likely due to the meat under proper temperature and the food overall was very bland and non-appetizing. It's been months since that visit and I finally went here today to give it another shot. BIG MISTAKE! I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. When hummus is made, the garbanzo beans and tahini bring out such a robust flavor all on its own when made the traditional and proper way. Everything I've tried thus far is just soooo overly processed. Eating at Stephano's is like eating at the McDonald's of the Greek and Mediterranean food genre. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to kabob express on eastern and trop. Now that place is a lot more decent, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet. I swear coming from back east and Europe, people don't really know what good food is around here. Best Lebanese place I've tried thus far here in this town? Ali Baba's. hands down. * yells at Vegas. \" go there! Go there!\"* you will not be disappointed!! :)",

I had a chicken kabob plate, here's the breakdown: -chicken - burnt to the point that I had to cut off the outside of each piece, which was a really difficult task since the pieces were tough(overcooked) -rice - delicious, but had black flakes from burnt chicken on top -Israeli salad - very good, fresh and perfectly flavored  -hummus - just mwah  So I paid $14 for this and a bottle of water, and I received about $6 worth of food pleasure from the rice+salad side...and the said water;)) Oh, there's was alsonan average-tasting free baklava (available with yelp check in), so I guess that brought the food value up a little. Still, the baklava wasn't fantastic so it didn't help much.  Overall, it was an average experience (thanks to the nice service from a Serbian girl), but I will not come again.  On the 2nd thought, I might come for the bright pink pickled veggies from the condiments bar - those were absolutely addictive!  Anybody knows what vegetable/root they are?",

The portions were extremely generous and they threw in a TON of extra pita! We had leftovers the entire weekend.

Outside seating is nice in the spring time, and they also serve more than basic domestic beers (Almaza, Kirin, Flying Horse, etc) and hookah, which is served in the back.

This place went from a little deli to a cute restaurant with great atmosphere. The quality of the food has remained the same. The owners are extremely sweet, the food is filling, they have a great beer selection (yay Okocim!) AND they have black currant juice! (among other Bulgarian boxed juices...This can usually only be found in Europe or European delis) I will always have a special place in my heart for Stephano's.",

Kristian ordered a garlic chicken sandwich with fries for herself, and I split a cheese gyro (gyro w/ feta included) with Sarah.   The ambiance was good, and the place was really clean. The bathrooms were pretty nice too. We all sat in the back corner on the cushions and spent an hour+ chatting.   My gyro was good ($7.52 w/ tax included) and surprisingly, Sarah, who usually hates feta, liked it. Unfortunately, Kristian said her chicken tasted like fish so she only ate half of it. It was probably residual flavor from the grill. Oh, and they also serve pickled turnips on the condiment bar, so I had to grab a heap of those.   Would I be back? Yeah, if my parents are paying!",

    "text": "First time!  My brother, a UNLV student and longtime fan of Stephano's, brought my father and me here for an early dinner.   He likes it because it's so close to school, the portions are big, the prices are low, and they give free drinks as part of a student discount. I like it because the food was GREAT - flavorful, fresh, and tasty! My dad likes it because they don't put lettuce (or as he calls it: \"rabbit food\") in his Israeli salad. For different reasons, we were all happy customers.   I opted for the Greek Salad, with lamb/beef gyro meat on top. It was a hearty plate of crisp greens, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, olives, and feta. The portion was terrific - I wasn't able to finish it, even though I desperately wanted to. The house dressing was AWESOME. Highly recommend. It was both sweet and savory, with a tangy zing to it. They gave a generous helping of it on the side, which I proceeded to drown every forkful into. I also requested a side of tzatziki sauce to dunk my gyro meat. As a big fan of Mediterranean food, I appreciated that the salad greens were so fresh, and that the flavors were so robust!   Dad had a pita with falafel. He offered me a bite, which was generous of him. It turned out to be delicious - if the roles were reversed, I probably wouldn't have shared it!  My brother had the shrimp skewer plate. He happily proclaimed that the shrimp at Stephano's were his favorite shrimp, probably in the whole world, like ever. :) He kindly let me have one -- the flavor was smokey and rich. I wasn't quite as bananas about the shrimp as he was, but they were good. I'm a fan of citrus on my seafood, and think that these skewers could have benefitted from a healthy squeeze of lemon.   Be sure to check in for the free baklava! It was sweet, crispy, and nutty -- a small little square of honey heaven.  The only thing I noticed was that they kept the place a bit warm. We went on a summer day around 4:00 - when the sun burns at full force. I was uncomfortably hot during the meal.    But the food was solid and the flavors were on point, so I'll definitely be back!",

The warm bread with the charred meat and tzatziki sauce make for an awesome party in your mouth. My fiance ordered the gyro but that didn't stop me from trying it ;) lol. I ordered a kofta shawarma combo plate which comes with pita, hummus, tomato cucumber salad, and rice. Combo plates come with all those sides just choose your protein. The shawarma was just chicken. Not flavorful and juicy like I had imagined. I wasn't aware until reading a review that a garlic sauce that comes atop the shawarma but no trace or sign of it at all. The beef kofta was juicy and delicious. Again I love anything that's been on a grill or has grilled flavor. I've had it at other places and I seem to always enjoy it. You get more bang for your buck on a combo plate because with the pita can basically make your own gyro and enjoy the rest of the sides with it. You also have plenty of leftovers with a combo plate. I now have a new lunch spot close to work just make sure to remember to make sure your baklava came with your order. It's free with yelp check in but they forgot to give it to me and I was in such a rush to get back to work that I forgot as well. Oh well next time I guess.",

I check out the menu not really sure if I want to order, as I know what good Greek & Middle Eastern food is, & restaurants rarely get it right.  I noticed they had Mousaka & I said WOW, I haven't had Mousaka in years. I said that to the girl behind the counter & she just looked like I spoke a foreign language. No smile, no warmth, nothing.  Every time I asked her a question she didn't understand a word I said & I was starting to get frustrated.  I wanted to know what was on the Israeli salad as far as dressing. She didn't even know & kept telling me nothing. I was amazed they don't put any seasoning on their salad, so I kept insisting she find out. How can someone work in a restaurant & NOT know what's on the salad that everyone gets (it comes with almost everything).   She had to go ask the guy sweeping the floor & he didn't even understand. Finally I'm told it's lemon & I asked, because I don't use vinegar. It's unhealthy & it certainly shouldn't be on an Israeli salad.  Even when going up to get my food I asked if they only had plastic forks & she again didn't understand my question. Then after responding yes, she turns around & laughs at me. LOVELY.  Sure enough, it had vinegar on it & so I never ate it. In fact it was swimming in vinegar.  My only complement was mousaka, it was VERY good, but it was very small & for almost $12 it wasn't worth it. I never took the pita & of course the salad was a waste as it just sat there.  As I was leaving I asked her how much it would be if I got just the mousaka, not the salad or pita. She rang me up. I said NO, I want to know how much. I had to basically answer for her because she never could understand what I was saying.  She wouldn't give me a better price so I walked out & they didn't make the money.  I doubt I will be back. I can't stand cold ignorant people & the fact that 4-5 times I had to struggle with her understanding basic English & questions about the food, plus the expensive prices, they just lost a good customer, but knowing what I know about these types of people, they won't care.",

A few of us Yelpers decided to go there after the Jeff Mitchum gallery event. OK so really, we went there so that Tony T could use his soon-to-expire Groupon. Somewhat unfortunately, we came in during an open mic night. The performers weren't awful, but I guess we weren't really in the mood for the loudness.  Anyway, I ordered a pork souvlaki sandwich combo (fries + drink). My total with tax was under $10. The pork was delicious and the sandwich overall was just oozing with flavor (and literally oozing with the sauce). The fries were also perfectly cooked. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.  Make sure you check in to get your free baklava with a purchase of $5 or more. Theirs had the perfect amount of sweetness. I don't like it when baklava has too much of the sauce that makes the dessert way too sweet and sticky.",

If you're in the neighborhood, or even if you are far away, this is the Greek restaurant you should be coming too. The Mediterranean food is totally fantastic!  They have a variety of different salads ranging from Greek salad with chicken kebab, gyro meat, filet of beef, etc. he salad comes with a side of pita bread, either whole wheat or regular (app for the whole wheat, it is sweet as sugar!)  I typically get the grilled chicken kebab Greek salad and it is fantastic. It's the size of a bushel basket and could easily last two meals, but who has time for that! Everything else on the menu looks fantastic so if you're in the neighborhood give this a shot.  So here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes",

Tonight I also checked in via Yelp and recieved a free piece of baklava for dessert. Which a co-worker woofed down with a smile on his face.  Tonight I chose the #8 combination plate with Chicken kabob and shrimp kabob. The plate came with rice, greek salad, a nice portion of humus and I opted for whole wheat pita, which was delicious!    It usually takes a little longer than one would hope for lunch, but the food is quality and worth the extra wait. Be sure to order on the same ticket, if eating at the same time is preferred.  For my group,  that's not a problem,  we eat as we are served, with no complaint.   I will always recommend Stephanos to anyone looking for a healthy eat spot near UNLV. Enjoy!",

I have had gyro in the past at this shop in DTLV which blew my mind away. Unfortunate to say but gyro here fell short in the flavor and ingredients used.   First,  beef and lamb are char-grilled and cut up in slices. My gyro wrap came with roughly around 5 pieces which was plenty for such a small wrap.   It came with tzatziki sauce which I believe is made with sour cream and cucumber. It tasted like ranch dressing to me but it was good regardless. I wish the sauce was not just on the two ends of the wrap, but inside the wrap as well.   Service was quick but lady was impatient with me. I will be back to try more items.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Stephano's for years and I have never been disappointed.   Today I got the Gyro Salad, and it was good.  At first glance it looks like a paltry amount of sliced Gyro meat, but looks are deceiving.  There is plenty of meat to create a nice balance with all of the other salad ingredients which include:  fresh and bright green romaine lettuce, Roma tomatoes, a generous amount of crumbled feta cheese, Greek olives, and overly substantial amount of sliced raw white onions (note:  sizes of onion slices are also overly substantial).  The salad is also served with 2 grilled pitas, so it's not a light meal.  I recommend the salad; the dressing is basic but good with red wine vinegar and dried oregano as dominating flavors.  The gyro meat is grilled which is a nice touch, because like 99% of all gyro joints, Stephano's  uses the factory processed gyro force meat that tends to be salty, but the grilling cuts down on the saltiness.  They also take the time grill the pita bread and it makes a world of difference in the flavor and is much appreciated.  Stephano's only gets 3 stars from me for many reasons.  The prices are pretty high for a quick lunch place, my lunch was around $9.00 and there wasn't much to the preparation.  There was no perception of value, especially since it caters to people on a students' budget.  The amount of raw onions were insane.  I love raw onions but even after picking most of them off, I could feel the sulphurous onion essence seeping from my pores.  I'm going to class for the next 5 hours and I feel bad for those that have to sit around me.  Another thing that is hurting the star rating of Stephano's is the fact that they use those annoying pagers to notify you that your order is ready.  The pagers are constantly going off around you, they are annoying and stupid.  A few final notes; the free wifi is great and they do have a lunch/student special which offers a free drink with certain orders.  If you go during lunch, avoid the lunch rush (12:30 until 2:00 ish) it can get uncomfortably crowded in there.",

It was the best chicken I've had in a long time.    The atmosphere was laid back and relaxed.  I loved the fact their menus that hang above the cashier was big and very legible.  It was very clean inside and even had a hookah lounge towards the back.  The decorations were colorful and the set up was almost like a food court setting with all the chairs and tables spread out with a good amount of space.  I was also  amazed by how nice the cashier was and helpful too.   Only thing I don't like was the rice.  It tasted old and off.  Despite that, I would go back again for the chicken, salad, and hummus.  Mmmm... hummus.",

Also, their french fries were strangely very addicting with the perfect amount of spices. And that sauce that they serve on the side was finger-licking good.   However, I felt that the chicken gyro pita was a little bit of a let down. The meat was super tender and so succulent and juicy, but I felt the pita sandwhich overall was a little bland and one note in flavor.   Overall I would definitely recommend stopping in Stephano's for some great greek dishes and don't forget to check-in on yelp to claim a free dessert or side!",

The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, I love the colors inside, very warm and welcoming. Stephano's would be a great place to go to at night for some drinks but I have yet to make that trip.   Their service is great, Nick one of the employees and future owner I presume is great and always friendly.

    "text": "This place is mediocre at best!   I deliberately and extensively researched for affordable, quality Greek food in the Las Vegas area, and I was led to believe (by reading yelp!) that Stephano's would be worth trying *** n o t ! ***  When i arrived at lunchtime, there were only two other customers in this place, which is across from the UNLV student center.  THAT should have been a warning!  I ordered my favorite dishes to go:  spanakopita (spinach pie) and hummus.  When I eagerly took the takeout bag to my car, the smell of the food teased me too much, so I gave in to my temptation to sample the food before leaving the parking lot.  I'm so glad I did, because the spanakopita (hailed as their \"signature\" dish) tasted awful.  it seemed as though it had been baked, then sat out for a day or so, then deed-fried, then microwaved before serving it to me. In short, what they served me was more like a Greek hockey puck than a delicious, crispy, buttery delight.     Even worse, when I returned to the store to demand a refund, the cashier laughed and told me he didn't know how to process a refund! (huh??).  He insisted I wait for the manager to return (from where, i have no idea).  Like a fool, i did wait, and wait, and wait...until I spotted a tip jar on the counter and told the cashier to just give me a cash refund from the jar, so I could be on my way.  Bottom line...there wasn't one person in this place who seemed to know what they were doing or seemed to care about what they were doing....and they even admitted that they don't even eat the food served there!  What's that all about??    Too bad I can't reduce it's yelp score to zero!",

The staff is always super friendly and they never have a problem answering questions about the food. I've actually met Stephano a few times as well and he's a very nice man. My favorite thing I get is the chicken shawerma, with of course the French fries. Probably the best French fries I've ever had. I'm from Fresno, Ca but I visit family in Vegas every month, so every time I'm here I never forget stop by Stephanos. Beside the amazing fries, the shawerma is perfect, I love the gyro as well, and you can never go wrong with the garlic chicken press sandwiches!  Also, the last two times I went, I got the pasticcio and I fell in love with it. I'm gonna have a hard time deciding between the shawerma and pasticcio next time!!",

    "text": "For our first trip into this University area eatery my Wife and i tried appetizer Spinach Pie. We then moved on to Pasticcio (Greek Lasagna) and a Pork Souvlaki plate. Topped off with big cups of \"Tropical Passion\" Iced Tea.  The spinach pie was a good sized portion for an appetizer. It was warm, very crispy pastry and a nice spinach mixture layered within. I tasted the spinach, a hefty cheese, and maybe even some nutmeg. I liked the taste.  My Wife's Pasticcio was served in an rectangular aluminum baking tin. It was browned nicely on top. Breaking in to the concoction she found it hot and bubbly, a lot of ground beef, a heavy bechamel sauce, layered with pasta. The smell was wonderful. Her comment, \"I am going to be so full when I am done with this\".  My Souvlaki plate was hot, loaded with a nice bed of white rice, two skewers of grilled pork, Hummus, Israeli Salad, and two pitas cut in half. There were five thick, well grilled, and juicy pieces of pork on each skewer. The Israeli Salad was a chopped mixture of cucumber, tomato and onion. It was spiced well so there was a bit of a background \"nip\". The Hummus was thick and flavorful. it was just as I like it. I can see myself with a load of bagel chips and a bowl of it while watching TV.   OK, 1/2 a pita folded, a good spoonful of some very good Tzatziki sauce, a spoonful of Israeli Salad, and two or three pieces of pork. Wrap it all together and open wide to enjoy these absolutely wonderful mixing of flavors. I was in love with a food again.  By the way. the Tzatziki was filled with chopped onion and cucumber in a thick Greek Yogurt. This was the real crowning touch to these little sandwich rolls I made.  The prices here are really reasonable. Expect to see a lot of College students. I would expect that this is a real good stop for them. Hearty food, Great Taste, and well within the College Student price line.  They have a great assortment of very interesting off brand beers. I watched a couple guys drinking a real nice looking dark beer. I think that a cold beer may be in the order when we show up here again, soon.",

For $10 I got half a chicken, rice, Israeli salad, hummus, and pita bread. All of it was so filling and so satisfying. The chicken had a ton of flavor and hints of lemon. The rice was my favorite part of the meal. It had a unique flavor to it and even though I was full, I couldn't stop eating.   Be sure you check in if you have a yelp account!

    "text": "I am a huge Greek/Mediterranean food lover so I had high expectations for this place after going to Market Grille Cafe for so long.  Walking in, I noticed immediately that the seating area was much bigger than I anticipated. Whether or not they get that busy I'm not sure, as I went around 2pm and there were only two other gentlemen eating there. Of course they play your traditional Mediterranean music which pairs well with the decor.  I placed an order ahead of time and initially planned on taking it back to work but decided to eat there instead. The man running the customer facing counter was pretty friendly and welcoming. To the left of the register I noticed a tall wall sectioned into different \"levels\" of beers; all assorted based on quality and price. I saw they had Innus and Gunn which had me perk up instantly since you'll typically find this at a liquor store only. I ordered one along with my meal but ended up disappointed as they had it displayed on the wrong shelf, expecting it to be $3.50 when in reality cost close to $5.00. When I asked about the price he replied, \"Oops, someone must have put it on the wrong shelf. Do you still want it?\" I was hoping he would have made some sort of effort to adjust the price this one time but no such luck. I went with a Blue Moon instead. This was my only negative experience since I work retail and whenever I encounter this issue I try to take care of the customer within reason.  I ordered a lamb Gyro wrap. When I called in and asked about the portion compared to a full Gyro, they said it's smaller compared to a typical Gyro but can still fill you. They were right about one thing, it definitely was filling. If this was \"small\" compared to their typical Gyro then you had better bring an appetite for a Gyro. This wrap was definitely a good size and the price was definitely generous for the amount. The meat was very tender and the hummus tasted very \"authentic\", unlike some cheap hummus you'd buy from a store. They also throw some pita bread and hummus as a side at no charge and free baklava, which was also very good, if you check in on Yelp.  I only give 5 stars to places that absolutely blow my mind. My experience was very desirable here and earned a solid 4 stars and to be honest if this were closer to home, for the price, portions and quality I'd definitely eat here over Market Grille Cafe. If you like Greek food you won't be disappointed.",

She kept staring as we walked out. HELL NO. LEARN TO DO BUSINESS.",

As a vegetarian I can't personally vouch for the gyros, but my sometimes carnivore spouse loves the cheese gyros with lamb. I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).  The restaurant itself is clean and spacious. Although I've never tried out the hookahs myself, I've often witnessed others enjoying them immensely. There are big tables/booths that are perfect for dining with a big group, as well as smaller tables for smaller gatherings. There are also a couple flat screen televisions that are usually tuned to sports or the news.",

Here's what happened during the 14 minutes between the time I ordered and the time I received my food: 2 adults and a child were served.  On minute 13 of waiting I go up to the counter and ask if I have a gyro coming, I am told almost. Sure enough, minute 14 my buzzer rings.  I excitedly get my gyro and fries. The bread and meat had  no warmth what so ever - about room temperature. The fries were done cooking eight minutes prior. I know because I opened my first restaurant in 1988 and \"dead\" fries haven't changed since then. The gyro was like biting into a salt brick.  I thought of saying something to one of the 4 young adults behind the counter. I thought better of it because they didn't seem to care that the food took way to long. They were all standing back there-they know what I received.  For 11 dollars and change they should have been ashamed at what they served me.",

I had to move to four separate tables before finding one that wasn't layered with crumbs from the previous guests. But most notably was the graveyard of dead cockroaches that was located in the men's bathroom--there's no excuse for that.   Overall, Stephanos is easily a 4 or 5 star location when it comes to the food. But due to my poor experience with cleanliness, I'll most likely stick with the Fort Apache location moving forward.",

Slimy and tasted old. Gyros were ok. They give you a ton of meat, weirdly cut in large wedges instead of thinly as most places do, but it doesn't really matter when its burnt and doesn't really taste like much. I probably has a teaspoon of sauce inside my gyro which of course wasn't nearly enough to go around. I think our tab was somewhere around 35 bucks, which was way too much for this food. Next time I'll stick with Halal Guys and get twice the food for the same price.",

I've been to other places in this shopping center and they're kinda old looking inside. This place looked like when I stepped inside, I landed in a Summerlin shopping center.

I've been meaning to hit up Stephano's after trolling their booth at the 89XXX elite event what...two years ago? Yeah two years ago, it's been a while with Operation Enduring Freedom and all i just never had a chance to go.  Whoa the food is good. The Gyro is a lamb and beef blend. Would have loved for it to just be lamb but they do it right. They slice the gyro meat from the huge rotating hunk of gyro meat then they grill it some more to char the sides just to give it a fresher taste. Bravo guys and gals at Stephano's BRAVO!!  Their options of condiments is just Aladeen...Sriracha AND Tapatio?!?   If gas prices were cheaper I would GLADLY make the trek toward the UNLV campus just to grab me a Gyro.",

    "text": "Stephanos's has been a staple of the UNLV dining scene for years. Located right across the street, from the Student Union, Stephano's offers some great and authentic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food for students craving more than just generic burgers and sandwiches.  Stephano's is a great place to be adventurous in your selections if you are familiar with Mediterranean dishes, but if your new to the scene, you can't go wrong with the Beef & Lamb Gyros, or the Garlic Chicken sandwich. However, a MUST try are the fries and the baklava. I don't know what they do, but have some of the best fries in the city. Super crispy along with a tasty fry sauce make it a must-have when stop by here. The baklava is incredibly flakey with subtle hints of honey and nuts.  The restaurant itself is pretty standard. Coming in you see a variety of chairs and tables, and you walk up to the front counter where you place an order. It's a cross of a restaurant (the food is usually brought to you and it takes a while to make it fresh) and fast food (you order off a menu board, pay right away, and get your own drinks), Tucked away in the corner is a lounge/couch area where they used to serve hookah and drink. They got rid of hookah, but the area is still open to those who wish to lounge around.  I consider the prices to be a big high for the UNLV/Student budget. At about $10 for a combo meal, its definitely approaching sit-down restaurant food prices. But I think its definitely worth at-least a try, especially if you are looking for real Mediterranean fare.",

This is the first place I've been to that I've actually came back to. Their beef shawarma reminds me of the ones my family used to get in Philippines (yeah, that's a little weird.. Philippines for shawarma?!). It's so good! Their fries are also delicious. They're light and fluffy on the inside and crispy and flaky on the outside. And whatever they use to season them just makes it more yummy.  The cashier is also very nice. It's always the same guy every time I come in.   Oh and it's such a plus that they have blue powerade for one of their fountain drinks, which surprisingly has more flavor than the ones you get at the stores.",

They still throw their fresh, tender pitas on the grill, imparting a smoky char that adds depth to the flavor of sandwiches.  But there's less in the sandwiches than there used to be, and prices don't nearly justify the amount of food you get. Four slices of gyros meat on that sandwich. Three falafel balls on a pita for almost seven dollars? There are times when I can eat three Stephano's sandwiches and not be full.  Their fries seem like a poor imitation of the famed Athens Fries served up the street at Paymon's. The tabbouleh is OK, maybe a little salty. Grape leaves are textbook. The hummus is simple and adequate but nothing special.  Oh, and they have a tendency to forget items. Check your inventory.  They do have a notable selection of bottle beers and teas. There's also a Foursquare check-in deal for a free baklava with $5 purchase.  This place is OK but it's not what it used to be. Sad face.",

It is not fancy, and that's exactly what I wanted in the middle of a trip to Vegas book-ended by expensive, fancy on-the-strip meals. We randomly stumbled across this place while driving back to our hotel from drinks at Mandalay Bay. I love Greek food, and when I saw the sign, I knew that's what I wanted that night for dinner. Didn't know what I was getting in to, and it seems this place is in-tune with social media like Yelp and Groupon--smart of them!  First of all, walked in 10 minutes before closing...My wife and I are not the type of people to push the envelope--I understand closing times and if the people working who had been on their feet all day didn't want to deal with me, I'd understand--there were a plethora of other restaurants in the area we could have gone to another place nearby. But the guy behind the counter warmly welcomed us.  Had the gyro plate. A ton of food, all really good, especially the pitas. Hummus was creamy and good...Not the best I've ever had, but still--good! They weren't busy with it being so late, but the food came out in like 3 minutes...Did they know what I was going to order before even I did?  While waiting for the food, we were making small-talk with the gentleman behind the counter, and I asked about the spinach pie (I was torn between that and the gyro). 5 minutes after the gyro platter came out, he showed up at our table with a half-order of spinach pie, on the house, just because he wanted us to try it. What the hell? That's service. (And he knew I was an out-of-towner, not like he was winning over a customer that can come by once a week).  A few minutes past 9, as he was walking to the front door to lock it and turn off the 'open' sign, he explicitly mentioned to us, \"I am closing up, but please take your time--no rush!\" (Not sure if I've ever had that at a small, counter-service restaurant like this before). He even kept selling beers to another table past 9.  I was impressed. Excellent, friendly service and pretty darn good food. I do come to Vegas 5-6 times a year for business, and will add this mom-and-pop to my repertoire of 'locals' places that I frequent.   Finally, like the post below says, the icing on the cake--or shall I say 'icing on the baklava' was blue Powerade on tap. C'mon...You don't get that anywhere.  We'll be back.",

Even the people from zulu nations would like it. A meat lover like me relish at the ribeye wrap or the half chicken plate. Where as my wife on the Insanity diet prefers the falafel plate.

Isn't there supposed to be an age limit on that kind of thing?)  Anyway, since were in the vicinity, we were looking forward to a stop at one of our favorites : Paymon's. Of course, it was no longer there. I believe it closed due to the horrendous traffic on Maryland Pkwy resulting from the interminable road construction. Since we had already battled our way down as far as Flamingo, we decided to google the closest Mediterranean place and just deal with it. This is closer to Tropicana, just across from UNLV, so in those three blocks or so we nearly lost our lives only 4 or 5 times.   It was a little later later in the afternoon when we finally pulled in, so the place was fairly empty. It is quite spacious so I can imagine that if they get a large lunch crowd it might take a while to get your order. I made my choice and parked my carcass at the table while Babygirl was dispatched to the counter. Yes, I am quite lazy, but mostly I made her do it because I spotted a large electronic display board which made me suspect you had to punch some buttons on a screen to order. I was in no mood to be traumatized by undecipherable technology.  The kid at the counter was friendly and helpful to her (of course, she's pretty) and our order was ready fairly quickly. I had a chicken souvlaki wrap. Normally, I would never order anything with the word \"wrap\" because I hate raw flour tortillas, but this said it would be in a pita. It sort of was, but it was kind of a thin, floppy pita so by the time the moisture soaked in, it was turning into a regular wrap. Yuk. Fortunately, I was able to eat a lot of it quickly before the damage was one, and the flavors were really nice. Good char on the chicken and nice, tangy tzatziki. The fries that came with the combo were good; hot and fresh and seasoned with whatever it is that all Greek places put on the fries that makes them so good. Babygirl got a salad with gyro meat. It was pretty nice sized, but for $12 or so, a salad in a cardboard bowl in place where you serve yourself doesn't seem like a great bargain. And I tried a bite of the meat, which is always highly seasoned anyway but this seemed dried like it had been rotating under the heat a little too long, so the salt and spice were really intensified. Too much for me. I would eat here again but only after they finish the road work, so probably never.",

    "text": "Was really drooling over the photos I stalked before coming here.  Dolma- lacked any flavor. So happy that I bought just one and not the whole appetizer. I added some lemon which helped, but I wouldn't get them again.  Cheese gyro- feta makes everything betta. I was expecting thinly sliced pieces of meat. Instead it was thick chunks of squared meat. Bummer, I don't eat gyros often because I end up burping them up all day. This lacked flavor as well. Minus the feta... That was awesome  Baklava- the reason why I gave 3 stars instead of 2. Whoever bakes these needs to open their own bakery and branch off of this place. It was perfectly sweet and crunchy.",

At this point I have tried majority of the combo plates, and have yet to try one I don't love. Its not just the meet thats great, but the hummus, Israli salad, and rice are all delicious. So much so you wont want to leave any of these large plates behind, usually leading to leftovers. Only complaint is it can be a little pricey, but this is usually balanced out with the large portion easily split in to two meals.   Don't forget the free baklava on check in to top off a perfect Mediterranean meal!",

My only gripe would maybe be that they put a lot of sauce. Honestly might be more of a preference but the flavors started getting somewhat overwhelming with the sauce and feta cheese (has a pretty strong flavor too). I loved the lentils.  Ally(plant eater): I got myself some pita and hummus and a side of lentil rice. The pita and hummus order comes with four pieces of pita and a big container of hummus, we didn't even finish it. The lentil rice, though, yes! It was very flavorful.  I called on the phone beforehand to check if they had any vegan options and the staff was super knowledgeable! They were quick to make the food too.",

Chicken dishes usually cost around $11 and steak or lamb dishes can cost as much as $18. That means depending on what you get, it might be on par with, or more expensive than, neighboring restaurants like Cafe Rio and Chipotle.   The food itself is pretty okay. Surprisingly, the first time I tried their food was a catered event at the University and it was AMAZING. Nothing I've gotten for lunch since has come close. I don't know if it's because they are rushed at lunch or just because they put more care into catering orders. There are better Greek places in town, but if you're near the University, the convenience of this location always wins out.   One last note, because of the university, they tend to have weird hours. I tried to stop by on a Saturday night once and they were closed. On a Saturday night!",

Fries were pretty good, couldn't wait to bite into the gyro, when i did i found that is was barely room tempature. The pita had no warmth at all, the veggies were skimpy and just thrown in there with no care.  I could have been satisfied still but there was barely any meat throughout the gyro, the most important ingredient in a gyro is the MEAT!!! The meat to pita and bread was about 1 to 4, unacceptable by Arbys standards and this is or was a good restaurant?  Didn't bother to complain the cooks knew what they served, had to go back to work, the only redeeming factor was the waitress was very nice, never going back.",

We went in for a late lunch on a Monday .Waited for about 4 minutes before the cashier showed up to the front to take our order . While waiting I was noticing the back of the restaurant where the sink area was looks like needs some work grossed me out a little . I ordered 2 meals a chicken shawarma plate with rice and cucumber salad and a chicken kabob with rice and cucumber salad and a side of tzatziki (yogurt cucumber ) with wheat pita and a baklava for dessert . We sat down no napkins in sight they give to you with your meal . When our food came out the portions were pretty ok in my opinion not worth the $35.50 +5 tip I paid upfront . Could have gone to an actual sit down restaurant and had food to fill me up and take to go for the next day . Food was good all in all but the lack of disappointment me .",

Hubby, daughter, and myself all went for the gyro combo. I was very excited to see that a garlic sauce was on the menu and asked for that on the side. It was not garlic sauce. It was more of a cold chunk of garlic butter.  We did have a choice of pitas...and I went for the wheat. It was very good. The fries were oversalted, but I rubbed it off.  Son ordered a gyro meat over rice with salad. It also came with a pita. We all tasted it and the salad mixed with the Greek rice was SO good!  We'd love to go back another time when we're in town to try the falafels.   Great food!  The only con was that it was freezing inside. Anyone can tell you that I don't get cold easily. It was cold in there!  I'm a tough customer when it comes to tzatziki sauce. This wasn't the greatest. It was like they forgot to season it. Where was the cucumber?  It was certainly lacking and needs improvement.",

Otherwise service was good, friendly staff and I felt like they appreciated my business. Food was great! I asked for low carb kebab combo (chicken & rib eye) which was not on the menu, but they gladly said okay. Israeli Salad was refreshing and tasty. Coworkers enjoyed their Gyros and fries.

I've been eating here since it was a tiny, little, brand new place. It's so popular that it grew into the neighboring store as well. I'll come here until the day I die. I've had gyros from all over the world and this is always the place I compare other gyros against because they are my top choice.",

    "text": "I moved jobs from CSN to UNLV in January, and in doing so I left behind a lot of restaurants that I miss dearly.  Like a child switching schools mid semester, a stranger in a strange food landscape, I spent the first several weeks here missing my old friends Hedary's and Frijoles.  Thankfully I found solace in an old friend in an unfamiliar location with Stephano's.    I frequent the Eastern location quite a bit and instantly had fallen for their gyros and rice bowls.  In a town full of Greek restaurants, I truly thought Stephano's was a cut above the rest.  In my first of many visits to this location I stuck mostly with the chicken kabob rice bowl.  Large, moist chunks of chicken served over delicious rice pilaf and an israeli salad.   Now in a futile attempt to actually reduce carbs, I usually get the Chicken Kabob salad which features those same chicken chunks over a standard greek salad of Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Olives and Feta.  Pro Dental Tip:  Watch those olives!  My wiltering, aging mind sometimes can't keep up with all the different places I order greek salads from and can forget that they are not pitted here at Stephanos.    I mentioned my futile efforts to reduce carb intake.  Well they're made even more futile by the delicious wheat pita bread Stephano's offers.   They don't hold back either, usually providing 4 halves, usually wrapped in foil to keep them hot and fresh.   It would be a fair practice to eat these pita like the cookie monster eats cookies.  They're that good.  Stephano's also provides a nice little station full of jalapenos, hot sauces, and other fixins one can choose to indulge in.    Sriracha and greek food goes great together I quickly found out.  As a final note, today I learned about a new reward program they've implemented.  With a swipe of my credit card and after punching in my e-mail, I was told that anytime I used that card I'd get points.  Now with most businesses this would probably give me pause considering all of the recent data breaches at Target, etc.   I didn't even hesitate.  Identity theft would be worth this chicken and pita.",

The meat is deliciously charred, there's just the right amount of ingredients, and the sauce is flavorful without being overpowering.  Also, the gyro is the perfect size; you're not ridiculously hating-your-life-full afterwards.  The fries are yummy, nothing too spectacular, but yummy nonetheless.  And they have a delicious thousand island colored dipping sauce that's a must!  I checked in on Yelp and got my free baklava.  It was super delicious and again the perfect portion for me.  Plus, everything is reasonably priced.  The gyro, fries, and drink combo only set me back $10.",

I decided to get that as a combo which came with fries and a drink for a total of about $10.  Kind of pricey in my opinion. I probably should have just stuck with the sandwich alone. After I ordered, I checked in and received my free baklava, a Mediterranean pastry. The food came out quickly after.  The gyro was great and I loved the sauce that came with it. Their fries also tasted fresh and were seasoned very well. The only thing is, I wish the portions were a bit bigger for a $10 combo. It was filling enough, but I'm not sure if it was completely worth it. I will say I loved the taste of the chicken. It has a good smokey flavor and you can see that they make it fresh when you're ordering.  Overall, this place has my thumbs up. They make me want to  try other Greek joints and see if they can compare to Stephano's. I give this place a solid 4 stars, and I would bump it to a 5, but as I said earlier, it is a bit pricey.",

I was stuck in my ways and went to the lounge down the street and completely overlooked this little shop.   The important thing is that I have been guided towards this delicious find now. Meeting a friend here for dinner before the AFAN Black & White Ball was an excellent decision. Even though food was a part of the event, I saw very little of it. Filling up on gyros, Israeli salad, and babaganoush was a smart move.   I never got to try the baklava when they participated in a past Yelp event. With everyone speaking so highly I was almost ready to try one until I stuffed myself. I passed during dinner. Then Tien came to the event with a tray of the good stuff and my willpower went out the window.   Sometimes it pays to have foodie friends. They will never lead you astray and make sure you are full.",

Gyros are, of course, their specialty, but they have an ample selection of shwarama, kabobs, various salads, and other Mediterranean delights.  They just remodeled as well from a small space that was basically a glorified, stationary gyros stand to a twice-the-size legitimate restaurant.  Their chicken kabob plate is astounding.  It includes some deliciously marinated and grilled chicken on a bed of rice with hummus, Israeli salad, pita and garlic sauce.  I make little packages of amazing deliciousness with the pita, garlic, hummus, rice and chicken.  It's nearly impossible to tell anyone how wonderful it really is.  It's my lunch comfort food.  There are so many fancy schmancy Mediterranean places every where.  Daily Chicken may not look like a whole lot, but they have the important stuff (great food, nice people) DOWN.",

Problem is, the food is nothing to get excited over. It has a hint of authenticity, but has been extremely Americanized. The gyros were okay, and the hummus and tzatziki were passable. The pitas were far too dry and tasteless, so they served solely as a vehicle for the mediocre dips. The garlic sauce on my shawerma was very strange...I didn't hate it with a vengeance like other yelpers did, but I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or not.  The interior was decent and cozy, but definitely had the \"college hangout\" vibe. Which is fine, of course, as long as you're okay with that. As many others mentioned, there is a hookah lounge too.  Customer service was mediocre to start, but warmed up throughout the visit.  Surprisingly, the fries were the best part: Perfectly seasoned, thick cut, and extra crispy.  I'll probably return, due to proximity and price. I'd be willing to try their wide variety of \"Low Carb Plates\" which feature double meat and lots of salad, therefore omitting the offensive pita. But I'm going to keep on the lookout for a truly good Greek restaurant. I hear Fat Greek is amazing...",

    "text": "I am not a Mediterranean food expert but so far this place is pretty chill. Always friendly and on time. A cool chill spot to get some food that'll actually fill u up.  I like to get their veggie platter that has hummus, tubule, grape leaf wrap, salad, pita bread, and spinach pie. Yes it's a lot of food for one person so I try and share each time I order it.   If I am alone I order a ---- wrap but if I don't feel tol hungry I skip the wrap and order the ---- appetizer which is still a lot of food. The only thing I wish is For them to have more drink choices because their water does not taste good and I dont like sodas from the choices on the fountain. I know they do hooka at night but I never smelled it in the air during the day, which is the time i usually go for lunch. I've tried their greek salad before but I don't know if they forgot to give me dressing.. there was no sauce whats so ever so i had a very boring salad. And they forgot to give me my free Baklava for Checking in! :(",

We each ordered the lamb and beef gyro platter at the counter.  Our plates included an abundance of gyro meat, (2) enormous whole wheat pitas, hummus, an Israeli salad and tzatziki sauce.   Also available was a tray of pickled carrots. All the food was fresh tasting and very filling.  A rating of 3.5 would be more accurate.",

    "text": "I bookmarked this place a couple of weeks ago when the other location was featured as a ROTD- this location was by an upcoming work training, so I penciled it into my schedule and grabbed lunch here today.  Prior to going, I read the reviews and perused the online menu, ultimately deciding on the chicken shwarma plate- I'm a huge fan of the dish and it seems like few places get it right. When I heard another review mention the garlic sauce this one is served with, I thought for sure I'd found a new favorite place worth the drive. And the rather-high $12 price.  When I arrived today, I was distinctly underwhelmed. Location was hard to find from the street- drove past it twice because the Stephano's part of the roadside sign does not stand out, and it is partnered with the word GYROS rather than the actual name of the restaurant itself.  But when I got in, I was the only one there, and the guy who took my order looked like he'd rather be anywhere else but in that restaurant. Order was taken with about 5ive total words spoken total.   Order was out quick. Food was lukewarm, but plentiful. I still had hope. Dug into the chicken and the quality was good, but the sauce I had so been looking forward to was a little runny and chalky- not at all what I wanted. Garlic flavor was very light, and the sauce seemed more like a tzatziki than anything else.  The salad was good, the hummus was okay and portions of everything were plentiful, which justified the $12 price. Pita was soft and warm, too, but a bit flavorless. But the chicken shwarma dish is just not what I'd hoped it would be.",

A little small for the money, and falafels neither tasty nor crunchy-but if it were excellent falafel, I'd have no problems with the size.

I wanna start off by saying that the food is good, I won't argue with that but you know what there are plenty of other places in Vegas who serves good Greek food as well as good customer service.   I wanted to try the Moussaka based on the recommendation from another Yelper, they told me they were out something about the oven out of order. Then I checked in on Yelp and the offer is free baklava. They were out of baklava too. I decided to order the Shrimp Kabab. 35 minutes later we were still waiting for our food. There were only 4 table occupied in the whole place. My husband finally checked on them and he was told that they are now making it because they ran out of rice. The food finally came out a minute later.  They have good food but that was a disappointing experience.",

With a Mediterranean feel for sure.   So I ordered the chicken shawarma gyro, and the gentleman taking my order suggested I get the combo with fries and I drank Ice tea and I got a side of extra chicken so I can taste just the meat.   I checked in on yelp and for checking in they give you a free baklava. It's a small peace, a lot of times the baklava is too big at restaurants too sweet and too full of syrup this was just Wright. So check in before you place your order.for a free desert   Food was really good, very authentic, tasted just like my aunts Greek cooking, I miss her so it was a nice treat. The free baklava was good enough that I went back up and purchased another one it was only $1.07 well worth it considering a lot of desserts are $4 to $8 dollars my lunch including the extra side of chicken was only $13 I was really full. I can't wait to go back and try the spanakopita.",

The WORST part is that the owner was there the entire time, and never offered even an apology (let alone anything else). Some people were so fed up, and had to go back to work, they they left w/o even getting their food. Even then, there was not even an ounce of apology with the staff or the owner!!! HORRIBLE... And I used to love love this place! Will not go there again.  The service has been horrible the last several times I've gone there...",

Upon Entering its laid out nicely. Great seating area. 3 flat screen Tvs. Comfy wide chairs and normal wooden chairs. FREE WIFI. Free baklava when you check in. AWESOME. You can see meat rotating on spits behind the counter. And they hand you a buzzer that lights and vibrates when your food is ready.   Music is playing loud enough to here but soft enough you can hold a conversation without yelling. They also serve Alcohol. Mmm Yummy. I had the Gyro Plate. Its Beef and Lamb on Pita. Comes with a extra pita to dip in Hummus and israeli salad. Your pita can come in White or Wheat i like the option because somedays I love wheat bread. The Beef and Lamb was perfectly cooked and had a smoky flavor and spices i never experienced before. They give enough tzatiki sauce. The vegetables on the gyro are nice and fresh.   The hummus had the right amount of olive oil floating on top to mix in. And i must mention the gyro and the extra pita come out piping hot. While the Gyro is cooling off i recommend tearing apart the pita and dip it in hummus. Which is what i did. Ive had hummus at other places and it wasnt so great. Here it was on point. Never having Israeli salad before i wasnt sure what to expect. It looked sort of like Pico De Gallo but had great seasoning and spices in what i believe was a Olive oil sauce. Hell Id go back just for the salad. And for the price you will definitely leave full. I didnt have room for their baklava which is delicious.  Next time you go, CALL ME and ill meet who ever is going.",

    "text": "This review is a long time comin'. Stephano's is the official Endorsed Hookah Lounge of Matt C. Let me break it down for ya:  Hookah --- Stephano's does a good hookah. Period. It's priced fairly, and usually lasts 2+ hours. Hookahmaster General Nick (a title I just invented) is an avid smoker, and takes pride in his work. He's often working on new tweaks for better smoking, and can wax poetic on things like shisha quality, etc. But, what initial got me coming back to Stephano's was the smoking quality/time/money ratio. Paymons' can make a good hookah too, but they never last over an hour. For the same money, you can smoke for hours at Stephano's, plus the refills are cheaper.  Food --- I like it, and most people I bring enjoy it also. It's not super-cheap, but I never feel like I've overpaid either. My personal favorites are the gyro pizza and the gyro bowl. It's not on the menu, but they also serve edamame, which is the perfect hookah nosh. Their beer menu is also pretty strong, and well priced.  Ambiance --- This is something else I really like about Stephano's - it's casual atmosphere. It's a relaxed environment, and I don't feel conspicuous if I'm  sitting there alone. They have regular height tables up front, which are great if you wanna work on something while you're smoking, and a banquette'd lounge-area in the back (great for dates). Plus, even when they dim the lights in the evenings, it's still usually bright enough to read - not the case at Paymon's. If you're looking for a dark, super-romantic place though, it might not be the first choice. I will say that my FLF prefers the environ of Stephano's over all the other like establishments I've taken her.   Service --- Food wise, it's served at a counter, kinda fast-food-style. But if you're smoking, you get waiter service along with it. There's usually only one person doing all the serving/hookah-tending, so it occasionally gets slow, but It's a family business, so you get the plus'es and minuses of that. Nick especially is good about keeping coals tended properly. Owing to the family business thing, I was able to get the aforementioned edamame on the menu quite easily. I don't know about you, but I really like a place that caters to its customers.   Conclusion --- I like it here, a lot.  The 5 is comparative to local competition. I don't like giving 5's, and Stephano's isn't perfect, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas.  There you have it.  PRO-TIP: Edamame + hookah = win PRO-TIP: Hookah service starts at 5.",

    "text": "i tried the garlic chicken sandwich, lentil rice, and small humus plate. The flavors were fantastic! The garlic was not over powering, nice smokey flavor in the humus, which I found went so well with the sandwich. It came with fries, which were nice and crunchy with a nice tomato aioli to dip in. The rice had a good flavor, not yo heavy and very satisfying.  I ended it with a piece of baklava, which I must say highlighted the entire meal. The baklava was sweet, buttery, flaky, and had such a great texture to bite into.  I left full and happy.",

    "text": "i've been on a hummus kick lately(just checked out Hummus Bar) and when I was at school and yelped hummus this spot came up and I was psyched.   Ordered an order of hummus and two chicken kebabs. The portion was a very good size.The price is also very low, I paid the same amount as Hummus Bar but got twice the amount of food.  I would say the hummus is of  equal quality  maybe not as smooth as HB but it's not even noticeable. However Stephano's pita is a bit on the harder side and I prefer mine soft and fluffy like at HB's.",
