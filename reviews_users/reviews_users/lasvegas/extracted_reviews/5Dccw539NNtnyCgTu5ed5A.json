I have also ordered the Salmon Curry and Thai House Fried Rice.    The reason why I ordered the Salmon Curry was because I wanted to try something different than my usual order of Beef Panang.  BAD IDEA.  Salmon Curry tasted odd.  Just did not work for me.    I was looking for the Crab Fried Rice on the menu, or something in comparison to Pin Kaow's Crab Fried Rice.  The Thai House Fried Rice was the choice.  Didn't enjoy that as much either.    Will I come back..yeah, I will for the Tom Yum Shrimp and the Beef Panang if I am in the area.  Also, the staff has always been very friendly.",

I was surprised by some of the negative reviews about the slow service, but I'm usually getting takeout & they have never been late or screwed up my order!  The soups are my favorite! I've never had better Tom Yum than what they serve here. My second favorites are the spicy beef salad (I get it as a 7) and the papaya salad. Pad Thai is awesome as well.  They offer Chinese dishes too & my fave is the house fried rice. Pineapple !! Yum..  I enjoy the Taro milk tea with boba. It comes with crushed ice instead of cubes & I dig it.

I've been introduced to this nice cozy spot from a friend couple years ago and I've been coming back ever since...why??? Two reasons:  1. Fantastic customer service - every time you walk in, you are always greeted with a smile and an up beat enthusiasm. Very friendly! and are on top of their game.   2. The food is delicious! - I always order Pad See-ew (excuse my spelling) with tofu that I substitute instead of meat. TRYING to be on a diet. lol. Also the Kung Pao Chicken. The server always ask me how spicy? I say the spiciest! My friend and I are literally perspiring eating it, but we love spice. tssss!   This restaurant has a karaoke stage and small dance floor. Every now and then they have someone sing. But I don't think I'll ever come to dance though. \"just here for the food!\"",

    "text": "I'm reviewing this establishment's physical location. I have ordered from them through Eat 24 numerous times. A couple of occasions they were late, understandable since I put those orders in around noon where they're busiest. Anyway, I was treated to a birthday lunch on a Sunday at this place. The lady attending our table (I should've remembered her name) took our orders and was quite pleasant (for now).   So we ordered appetizers tofu and Thai beef salad. Tofu  came in quick. But then our first entree came in and still no sign of the salad. So we just grubbed along rather than having the food go cold. The rest of the entrees came but still no sign of that Thai salad. So I asked the lady what was going on with the salad, and she just shrugged us off a bit and said it's on its way. The table opposite us was a party of 14 guests. She was attentive to them and not our little party of four. Guess coz she gets more tips from that size party.   We we're halfway through the Pad Thai when lo and behold, the salad came in. Well we still ate it, I mean it's good food. So we asked for the bill after cleaning off our plates and I amusingly asked the lady if there was a birthday discount, she was stern and said \"No we don't have a birthday discount\". At least greet the person (me) a happy birthday.   The whole place wasn't even that busy. There was us, 4-man table, a party of 14, and 2 other tables. I guess it makes sense why a few people were there for Sunday lunch, I guess everyone knows their service sucks so they'd rather enjoy ordering and eating at home (which I wish I'd done instead of driving all the way out there).  To be fair, I'll say it again, they're food is great. The older gentleman that delivers my food when I place an online order always has a smile on his face. But that lady, oh boy. I wish that she was just having a bad day and not like that to everyone.  So will I order food from them online? Maybe. Will I visit that establishment again? NO. For the record that was my first time visiting their restaurant. First impressions last. 1 Star for the food. Service is a big criteria for me and Thai House, unfortunately was a disappointment.",

I still keep it somewhat basic with simple dishes like pad-thai, bbq-chicken, pot stickers, etc. After eating at Thai House I think it's time to start venturing out a little deeper in the Thai food world.  First, their food is really good. The Pad Thai portion is enough to feed 3-4 people. The BBQ chicken is moist and has great flavor. The pot stickers might be the best I've had. I prefer steamed and they are gooey and don't fall apart. Great texture and the meat inside just melts in your mouth. My new favorite item on the menu are the Salad Rolls. Particularly the sweet and spicy dipping sauce topped with crushed peanuts that accompanies it.  That alone is worth the price of admission. Actually all of their dipping sauces are amazing. The peanut sauce is off da hook.   The ambiance is very nice, but the service could use a little improvement. On our most recent trip to this establishment we were waited on by someone who spoke no English. It was a bit frustrating when we were trying to get some detail about the items we were ordering. Also, I highly recommend dining when the incomparable Skip Eaton is performing some great classic rock hits.",

There is a guy that sings at night on weekends which is kind of funny not terrible just weird match. I wish they would fix their cords on the stage its an eyesore.

We've ordered from here a number of times, with varying levels of satisfaction. Here are the main issues that keep repeating themselves:  -After I had my daughter, my ability to handle spicy food lowered dramatically. As such, I order everything as mild as possible. I understand that Thai food is spicy, but \"mild\" shouldn't be so spicy that I can't even eat it. This happens more often than not, and it seems to depend on who is doing the cooking.   -They rarely deliver the right things/everything. We've received parts of other people's orders, and we often don't receive all of our order.   -The food is substandard and overpriced.",

It isn't like Vegas has any shortage of Thai restaurants, but the good ones are not as bountiful.  My issue with Thai tends to be that it is too rich, too sweet, and just overwhelming. Great Thai does not have to be this way.  Thai House is good. I just felt bogged down afterwards. All of the appetizers are fried. I knew I would get nowhere trying to order papaya salad with my friends so I just let them order. The wings and the sampler plate was at least not sitting in a pool of oil. The duck curry was short on the meat and was overpowered by the coconut. The pad see ew was the dish I liked the most. Their house fried rice is interesting, too. The pineapple, raisins and nuts made me think of biryani. I love biryani and it was different than anything other Thai place. For its close proximity, I would go back again for the last two dishes.",

We end up waiting forever to have our orders taken, and the waitresses are rude and never check up on our table. Having a partner who worked in some of the finest restaurants on the strip sit down to a meal with me, and be treated as such, is absolutely apalling.   The last straw, was when I ordered a dish, and the taste was fishy and rancid, and the noodles were over-cooked. When I asked for the manager, the girls were extremely rude and combative, until finally, we had the manager come to our table. After politely explaining that the dish simply did not taste edible, the manager was defensive and condescending, and told me that the dish is \"supposed to taste like that.\" The dish was supposed to taste like garbage? He refused to take it off our bill or even swap it out for something else. We paid and left promptly, and never returned. I was shocked. Never have I experienced someone so incredibly rude to me in a dining experience!  The lack of customer service greatly over shadows the food. After our third visit with horrible service, we will never be back again.  If you want UNBELIEVABLY bad service with management and servers who do not know what they are doing, then by all means, this is the place for you.",

I spoke to 4 different people, none of which could speak much English and all of them asked for my information all over again.  It took until the 4th person I spoke to to find out that they had not even started my order yet and that it would take another long while before it would arrive.  Definitely try the pangang curry if you dare brave the customer sevice.",

We typically take our meal to go as we really don't care for the tv carrying on while we dine. But our favorite dishes are the chicken Panang and the Pad See Ew! The sticky rice is delicious too! Nothing seems to disappoint except perhaps the spring rolls! I, personally, would give it 5 stars but I think there is room for improvement on their spring rolls and decor! My BF, on the other hand would give it a perfect score of 5 stars!",

I ordered the Crispy Sweet Squid(Which is Calamari) and the House Lemon Chicken. When I went home and opened my plates. I couldn't believe what I saw. The lemon chicken was in the shaped of onion rings! I mean how is this even possible? They gave me a small cup of not even lemon sauce, but it taste like orange juice and pulp with a splash of lemon juice. Is this a joke I thought? The Calamari was breaded and fried very hard and when I bit into it the breading fell off and I was left biting into a chewy piece of squid! Yuck!! OMG I can't believe I spent $23 on this Crap. I will never go to this place again! You have been warned!",

After taking care of our business at the UPS store, we decided to grab a bite to eat, and since all 4 of us like us some Thai food, we decided to give this place a try. The place was a trip lol. The place had some cool asian decor in it, but their were light fixtures that had cobwebs and dust hanging off of them. That was a bit off putting.  I went as a memeber of a party of four. I ordered the combo fried rice plate. It was kind of awkward that everybody else recieved their food about 10 minutes before I recieved mine. This was a little annoying, but not a deal breaker. When I did recieve my food it was very good! The shrimp was especially tasty and the pork was also nice and juicy!   Two of the friends I went with are Thai and had a little portion of everyones plate, just to check it out, and he said that the food was just \"ok\" and that the fried rice combo plate was by far the best of all four of ours. I guess I got lucky!  I guess my biggest complaint is that the service was so sllllloooooowwwwww. OMG. Like I said, it was annoying that everyone was eating and I sat there for almost 10 more minutes waiting to get my food. The lady who was our server was nice and was very good about refilling our drinks.  All in all, it wasn't bad, but I've certainly experienced better.Maybe I'll be back one day since one of my friends loves his place, but I won't be going out of my way apart from that.  3 stars.",

With Thai food, you have to be cautious of the level of spiciness but here they make sure to ask you how spicy you want something. There have been times I've ordered the Spicy Chicken Fried Rice at a level 8 and sometimes it's so spicy and other times it's not spicy enough. It definitely depends on the cook, so I'd suggest just picking a number you usually like to go with on a scale from 1 to 10 on spiciness (1 being not spicy and 10 being the hottest).  It's clean and the water they gave doesn't have that taint of sink water, so if you're thinking of dining in, it's definitely a great option!",

It's usually in a tiny rice bowl.  -  Spice rack looked nice.  - Yellow curry: Chicken was a bit hard. Potatoes and carrots cut nicely. Thick and well-flavored curry.  - Pad Thai: Good. Not too sweet.  - Spicy eggplant: Inconsistently cut eggplant. Some were raw others were well done.

To be honest, I've had tofu Pad Thai at many different restaurants, and the way they make it here doesn't have the most flavor; I say that as a compliment, however, because it tastes like it could be made at home with regular ingredients - not tons of MSG like I think a lot of Thai/Asian food places use to give people that \"flavor\" they just can't get at home.  Sometimes, it's nice to go and get the flavor of a home-cooked Thai meal without having to make it yourself.  I was also amused by the Asian couple doing karaoke while I was there; they were very cute!  Next time I want Thai food close to home, I'll be returning here - perhaps next time to dine in, so I can relax and enjoy the atmosphere.",

There curry pannang with shrimp is without a doubt the best we have ever tasted , we could slurp it and get messy and enjoy every minute. Get the wongtons and dip em in the curry pannang sauce, no regrets there. Timely delivery, moderately priced and online ordering was a breeze! Thank you thai house for an authentic delicious experience!!",

    "text": "Been a consistent patron here for years. The food is always very consistent and very good. Everything is good and fresh but I love the curries, crab rangoons, white cabbage soup and amazing seafood dishes.  Typically exceptionally great, warm service and friendly smiles. The atmosphere is very casual and fun, having a locals / neighborhood feel that is refreshing as so many places come and go. Dishes are wide-ranging and authentic; not shying away from traditional Thai heat. I love their staff and their pickup and delivery services are exceptional (even offering online ordering).  My only two suggestions would be A. new cutlery and B. fresh rolls always made to order rather than sometimes made daily and put in the fridge -- which are still very good though. Will be back again and again and again no doubt.",

    "text": "Great stuff!      I really love Thai food, and it usually takes me trying 5 or 10 different Thai restaurants around my home before I really find one that does a good job with the intricate flavoring.     So far, Thai House is my pick (though I will continue to try others).    The one constant problem I have is that the Mussaman Curry is never spicy/'hot' enough for me.    Thai House uses a heat scale of 1 - 10 so the first time I ordered it from them, I asked for #6.    I couldn't really taste any heat at all -- it might as well been level 1 or 2.   Nonetheless, the flavoring was still good.  So the next time I ordered it, I chose level 9.    Again, I could barely notice any spiciness.   So the most recent time, I chose spiciness level 10, which they call \"Are you crazy?\"     It had a couple dried peppers in it & yes, they were certainly spicy when I ate them, but that spiciness wasn't in the rest of the curry.   I don't know if I have some sort of medical issue which causes me to be impervious to it or what, but it's annoying that I can't eat any Mussaman Curry that causes me to hiccup & sweat.   Again though, this is a problem I have with all the dozens of Thai places I've tried over the past couple years, not just Thai House.     The 5 times I've been there so far have all been take-out orders, but the dining area looks nice, and it seems like on some nights (Fridays & Saturdays?) they have live music, which could be interesting.    I pass at least 4 other Thai restaurants tried previously in order to get to Thai House.  For now, it's my go-to place when I am hungry for good Thai food, though I need to keep trying the many other Thai restaurants here in the Henderson & Las Vegas area to find one that can provide a good balance of both heat and other flavoring.",

As we were leaving one employee walked to me and said \"oh...I was about yo go take your order\". I kindly said \"no thank you and walked out.

The cleanliness did not seem to be an issue. The service was great. We did the lunch special which for $6.95 ea included soup of the day (egg drop- large bowl but fairly bland, needed a large amount of chili paste and sriracha), and suppose to be dumplings and spring rolls. They were out of dumplings and just doubled up on spring rolls which was fine. I had the red curry with chicken and steamed rice and sis had pad thai with beef. My curry was adequate... it was not even close to best curry I have had by a long shot..but definitely worth the lunch price. Sister's pad thai seemed a bit greasy, but definitely not bad for the price we were paying.  I have been to Thai House while I lived on Silverado Ranch and every dish I had was above average to great. Worth checking out at least once.",

The food has been reduced in portions, the online ordering menu does not duplicate their in house or take out menu.  The customer service lately is HORRIBLE!  I placed my order online and my email confirmation stated my order would be ready by 8:09 pm.  I arrive at 8:13 pm and  usually, my food would be ready. 8:15.....8:25....8:35....8:40 my food was not ready.  I get a half apology by the guy who runs the place with a helpless expression on his face.  Didn't even offer me water or a small Thai Ice Tea while waiting.  I ordered my food online over an hour ago!  The waitresses scurrying around looking all stressed out.  Yes it was busy (all tables filled) and yes there were tons of orders on the counter (take out or other online orders).  But I just sat there without any acknowledgement or update on my food.  The only communication I had was with the waitress who confirmed my order when I walked to the counter and took my payment BEFORE my food was ready.  I always get asked for my payment when she has my take out ready and on the counter.  To top if off,  the staff just seemed so mechanical when I'm sitting in the booth closest to the register and they are tallying their pending take out and online orders (money) on their ten key in front of me. Without looking my way, acknowledging me or again, offering me something for the LONG wait.  I finally said something at 8:43 and all of the sudden. They come out with all my food.  They may not know me personally, but they do know I order at least 4-5 dishes from them at an average of $8-10 per dish not including tip every time I go.  I think I'll find another Thai restaurant to eat at.",

There is no person that does not speak clearly with a heavy accent to screw up your order, so I am guessing that they have a hard time reading instead.  As I have said in my other reviews, I don't eat a lot of Thai food, mainly because it is full of sugar.  I also can't deal with curries so my choices are limited.  I'm the first to admit that I'm quite boring when I order mostly pad thai.  And this place, does it way too bland for me, I prefer Pin Kaow's version to this.    But the real reason why I'm giving this place the rock bottom review is that the last time I ordered from here, I got massively sick from the shrimp pad thai (I ordered tofu and extra vegetables but didn't get those with it either).  I admit that everything else is ok that I normally get (stuffed chicken wings, beef jerky, satay), but this was not so fresh.  I guess I don't understand why people love this place so much.  Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things, but after seeing how they send out bad shrimp, my days of ordering Thai delivery not only here, but everywhere are pretty much over.",

My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite in Henderson and I must say, this Thai place is one of the better ones I've tried here.  The waitresses were very cordial and the place was clean. We decided to order the usual papaya salad (thai style). The flavoring for it was good, but it wasn't sour enough. We had to ask for more lemons to make it taste better. Next, we ordered the spicy squid w/ green beans and Yai-kee Maow. The spicy squid was actually very good! It was sweet, yet not too overbearing that you can't taste the spice. It's a good dish to share and eat with rice. The yai-kee maow, however, did not impress me at all. I could barely remember eating it. I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you really don't like Pad-see ew which usually is the better choie for flat noodles.   I'm going to give this place another try since it's close by and not too expensive. All the dishes ranged from $8-10. I think next time I'll try the more typical Thai dishes.",

He stated he wasn't late and I asked him what his sheet said he continued to argue with me and said he could just leave with the food. I said I would pay for the food but I would never use them again. The MANAGER then proceeded to curse me out after taking my money. I will absolutely never use this restaurant again and plan on reporting them to the BBB. I have never seen a manager of a company not apologize for being at fault.

He's very low key and not at all in your face trying to show off--just singing away with the volume not too high. It's fun to take out of town guests here for this reason. Their chicken coconut soup is better than Lotus of Siam's---like night and day. But the opposite is True for the satay. Most of the time there are just two of us and we're satisfied with just the soup, and still have some to take home. I've tried a few other things, but it's all about the soup.",

Calamari appetitizer was probably the only decent thing - but my friends didn't enjoy that. We ordered hot tea - and they brought out 3 huge bottles for each of us!!! (Of course they charge for each bottle!) the decor was nice though but not enough to keep me coming back. Sorry but I've had much better Thai food elsewhere",

The Curry was hot and super tasty and my wife ordered the Pad thai which was also spot on, the only other thing that we ordered that was also perfect was the Chicken Satay with peanut sauce.

When I reported my observation to a server and requested the general manager, the kid scurries away and returns after some time to tell me I misunderstood what I saw--that she was \"cleaning something inside the stall,\" and therefore, \"her hands were already clean.\" Oh, that's comforting... not to mention illegal.  When I asked for the manager again (loudly), the kid pointed an older Caucasian gentleman out sitting in a booth, lies that the man he just pointed out to me is unavailable, and then goes back on that lie and decides to tell me that the manager is actually in the back correcting the employee's unsanitary practices. I never got the truth, much less a manager. I had to abruptly walk out of there with my family even after we'd already placed our order because of these awful business practices. No joke--this place would be a health department official's delight. I'm making sure my friends and family never eat here (this place was dead as a door nail as it was... no mystery there after this experience). Unless you enjoy eating in third world country conditions, served by staff who are about as honest as politicians, avoid this place at all costs!!",

And while I am sure that some insufferably overpriced place on the strip offers great Thai dishes, there are few restaurants offering better curry than Thai House Restaurant.  How can I best explain this?  Well, let's just say that even if I had a severe neurosis about germs and scrubbed with Purell every 30 minutes, I would still offer to lick the sauce in their Panang Curry (sweet peanut based curry) off the floor . . . yeah, seriously, Off. The. Floor.  It is that good.  Given my over-dramatic love of the Panang Curry, why only 4 stars?  Well, it's not the customer service (because the servers are very friendly).  It's some of the Chinese dishes they serve, which are just average.  Not bad, but not amazing.  They have also slightly screwed up a few of my orders.  They're pretty bad at following through on requests to add tofu or vegetables to dishes.  But if you don't want to tweak their Thai recipes with special requests, you will have a great dinner.",

The lunch I think is either 6.99 or 7.99 I can't really remember but its sooo worth it! and it's not even expensive! They give you so much food to satisfy all 5 of your taste buds! I've also had a crispy orange chicken and Mongolian beef which was a little salty but the crispy orange chicken was superb! =)  I've came here during dinner too, but the food doesn't taste the same from lunch and dinner.

This was not our first choice, I think Surang was but it was closed down for the mean time. So we're on our way to this place and I notice that the area we're heading to is near my ex-gf's place.   I looked it up on Yelp and see that it's Chinese (SLASH) Thai food so I immediately started getting negative feelings about it.  We get there and guess what? Yes, you were right! This was the last place me and my ex-gf had last seen each other. That was a wonderful day so all the negativity went away.  We eat our food and that didn't change. It was ok. I wish I would have went to Archi's. If it was less pricey, I'd be ok with it. Plus they didn't advertise Coconut Juice!!! What the hell? I love Coconut Juice. Whack.  This was like watching the Sixth Sense for the 3rd time. YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO GO DOWN.  Not  as good as Passion of the Christ and definitely not better than Lethal Weapon 4.",

I decided to stop by here after a short visit to Khoury's.  I ordered the crab rangoon, and the green curry with beef.  I wasn't that impressed with the crab rangoon.  It was over priced, and just not that good.  I liked the cream cheese filling ok, with it's herbs.  The shell however was that store-bought, thin, almost candy like shell.  The sweet and sour was pretty standard as well.  I'd recommend skipping on this particular appetizer.  The green curry was a little better.  It was made from the typical canned stuff, along with an herb or two that made it a little unique.  It had some sweetness added to it even though I ordered it without extra sweetness (I don't know if they held back or not on the added sugar).  The dish was served with the standard bamboo, zucchini, and a red and green pepper or two.  The best part of the dish was the beef though.  It was nice and tender, and really easy to chew.  I quite enjoyed it!  They had live music on a Wednesday night, which was cool.  Just some older fellow with a guitar, but that is better than no live music!  The service was a bit slow, but they were quite busy for a Wednesday night.  There are a few interesting dishes on the menu that I wish I would have ordered instead of the curry.  I might return if I am in the area to try some different stuff.",

The prices were pretty standard as far as Thai restaurants go, but I was surprised to find they didn't skimp on the meat. My husband and I ordered the tom kha soup, crab fried rice and masaman curry. We were stuffed and still had enough leftovers for dinner.  The thai tea was delicious and served in a tall glass - again, they didn't skimp and fill the glass with ice like other places. The only thing they skimped on was the crab in the crab fried rice... crab was practically non-existent.  Service was warm and friendly. I love how they packed away all of our leftovers for us. Originally I was going to rate this 3 stars but after finding out that they do online ordering and can deliver as far as Southern Highlands, then my review bumped up to 4 stars. Any restaurant that provides that extra convenience deserves extra brownie points.",

The spice levels are apparently a little low for your typical 1 (wimpy) to 10 (flaming) range from what everyone else told me, so I guess order just a little warmer than your first instinct would tell you.  Other than everyone mentioning (both times we've eaten their food) the heat could have gone up one more notch, they raved about how good it was.

I live close by, prices are nice, restaurants is usually clean, they have live music performers sometimes, and  their staff is friendliest in town.   As far as the food goes, this place just does not make sense. You could order an item one night, and have an excellent experience, and order the same exact item the very next night ( which ive done several times), and be disappointed. The chicken fried rice, papaya salad, and tom yum gai are examples of this.  Ive had more great experiences then bad ones.

The last time I went here was for dinner on a Friday night, and to my surprise, they busted out the karaoke machine during dinner. While I'm all for karaoke, when I'm trying to have a conversation with my friends, I'd prefer if I didn't have off-tune singing in the background. A good idea to bring more fun to dining, for sure, but as the night progressed, I couldn't handle the singing anymore. Maybe if the singing had been better...  Anyways, this time around, my friend and I ordered the Wonton Soup in a Hot Pot ($7.95)- BBQ pork, vegetables & wontons in a clear soup. I was disappointed when the soup arrived, as it was served in a large bowl, not a hot pot, making for a less than steaming hot soup after a while. I enjoyed the BBQ pork slices and the bok choy in the soup, but the soup itself and the wontons in the soup were too sweet. Needless to say, we didn't finish our big bowl of soup.   In past visits, I've tried: Tom Yum Soup- too sour Green Curry- too sweet Thai BBQ Chicken- large portion, but the chicken was too dry  Maybe I need better luck next time when choosing what I should eat at Thai House, but the dishes I've tried so far have not been amazing. But what has been amazing is the service. I went for a birthday party once, and the servers brought out plates and utensils for the cake that we brought from outside free of charge. Talk about accommodating! All the servers are so nice and sweet that it's hard to not come back to give their food another try.",

    "text": "If losing weight is what you're after, come here. My friend and I were craving Thai food and the closest place to his house was this. Wrong place, wrong time to want delicious Thai treats.  The place had lots of empty tables at dinner time. We placed a to-go order and waited a few minutes. We got fried tofu, beef Thai spicy salad, sweet and sour chicken and Thai iced tea.  Fried Tofu: Average and nothing special which is a shame because I love tofu. The peanut sauce was bland and super runny. 1/5  Beef Thai Spicy Salad: Thin slices of beef on a bed of unchopped/ unshredded lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and I asked for no onions. It was as if it was too damn tideous to chop lettuce! The dressing was pretty good - a little sweet and spicy and you can choose on the spicy level from 1-10. 3/5  Sweet and Sour Chicken: The worst thing to order but this is what my friend wanted. He ate a few pieces until he noticed a very bloody piece of chicken. Seriously, that is plain gross. Salmonella!!! Which reminds me, I should probably check if my friend has puked his brains out. 1/5...make that -5/5  Why even bother running a restaurant if you can't even do the basics? Chopping lettuce and you know, cooking chicken. Salmonella: lose 9lbs in 3 days or your money back! Pad See EEEEEWWWW!!!",

I ordered the sweet and sour beef. Lunch special. I know! Beef! Where do you get sweet n sour beef! At least I've never seen? Only chicken, pork or shrimp. And I ordered the chicken potstickers appetizers. When you get the lunch special it's so much food! I received one pot sticker and one eggroll! If I would have dine in. I would have gotten a bowl of soup! It feed me and my son abundantly. He cleared his plate and I still had left overs. I'm so going here again just cuz of the beef! I picked the food up to take home and they are so friendly and nice! Great job guys! You have a future customer and I'll tell everyone about you! Thank you for being down the street and I'll be back to try other things if this was so good. Im sure a lot of other things are too!",

I was in freaking Thailand eating curry and wishing it was the panang curry I was having here instead. That's crazy.  Just try it. The food speaks for itself. I've recommended the panang to my family & friends & they have all fallen in love just as I have.  I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. Nothing will ever beat it.

    "text": "I would have given it 4 stars had I not realized that their calculations for my total have been wrong. I ordered three times this week! Just this week though... which is maybe why I decided to do the calculations myself.  Wish I had thought to do it sooner.  Think Ive been gypped around 2 bucks each time.  I even had to check if they raised prices again or if the state sales tax had changed. Neither has. They use an old calculator at the check out desk to which I assume they just hit a preprogrammed tax button so this could be the issue. I haven't brought it up to them yet but I will next time. So heed warning and BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR TOTAL AND SALES TAX.    Despite the math, the food here is great!  One of the best thai places in LV.  Lherrrve their pad see ew. Its my fav. I normally get beef. Panang is sweet and savory. I always lick my spoon at the end. Its soooo good. Their spice levels are inconsistent though as with all thai places. I wish they could quantitate peppers or microscale the spice to be more consistent.  Like 1/4 a pepper for level 1. 1/2 a pepper for level 2 but thats just my thinking.   Ive tried the singapore noodles which was bland.  Nothing special.   Sweet and sour pork is awesome especially when fresh.  I love a good crispy batter.  Its the same for the lemon chicken. Crisp batter with a real lemon sauce.  Lemon sauce taste homemade.   Roast duck is good.  Served over bok choy veggies.  I think its bok choy.  Thai tea is on the sweet side but I just wait for my ice to melt a little and all is well.   Ive eaten more things from here but if I dont stop now Ill never be able to get to sleep.

Their Seafood Combo (I think that's the name), Pad See Ew, combination fried rice and Papaya salad are also good. I also like that they have spice racks in every table, that way you don't have to ask, and you could order \"no spice\" then just add the spice later esp when sharing. Oh, and don't forget their Thai Tea! I don't know if they have boba for it, I never asked, but their Thai tea is the best in town. The service is good too. The owners are usually in there and would approach customers to make sure everything's going well.",

They actually read my review, explained they were changing cooks which caused my bad meal, and offered a complimentary meal for my next order.  Usually the delivery is super speedy quick. From the inital order placed, it took an hour and a half for my food to arrive, which i thought was strange and really annoying,  My curry was definitely better than last time. My only complaints are that the food lacks flavor and only really has spice/ heat to it. Same with my boyfriends pad thai. It was lacking meat as well.  I really really wanted to like this place,  but unfortunately, i really cant. Maybe its just because i always get delivery. Im not sure. But i was disappointed once again :(  Maybe you guya should bring back the cooks from two months ago when the food was to die for.",

From there everything went downhill.   Oh, I'll admit the spiciness is actually spicy: a ten is a ten, nice and hot, but I'm not sure what the odd taste was in both my Pad Thai and in my fried rice, maybe the oil, which could have been of poor quality or old; I'm not sure which, though the taste was repulsive enough that I only sampled either dish.  I can think of at least four nearby Thai restaurants that serve better food, though perhaps at a slightly higher price.,",

We ordered for delivery and the estimated time for delivery at 11am on a Saturday was 60-80 minutes. Long but doable.  At 90 minutes I requested an update to my delivery and they said the driver would be on the way shortly, we don't live far so he arrived about 5 minutes later as if he had just been sent when I called.  When I asked what kind of discount or way they were going to make it right, they insisted that the delivery was in the estimated time and refused to do anything.  The driver even apologized for being late so they clearly knew they were in the wrong.  Not thrilled about their customer service and that is the reason for the rating of 3 stars.",

On some occasions we choose to dine in the restaurant...when you have a little extra time to spare its nice to sit in their dining room. The waitresses all wear traditional costume which accentuates your Thai dining experience. The waitstaff are all very personable too. We have had the pleasure of traveling to Thailand...and the food that we eat at Thai House is very authentic...and transports your taste buds back to those days of dining on the beaches of Phuket.  Some of our favorites are Tom Kha,Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Sweet Chili Chicken, Red Chicken Curry, Basil Fried Rice, Chicken Chili Mint, Ginger Chicken, Cashew Chicken,Thai tea, and the list goes on... I've ordered online and over the phone. I've never had a challenge with my order being incorrect...sometimes a few minutes late...but so very worth it!!! We've ordered from Thai House so much that its a warm welcome to see their delivery driver at our door!!! They do their scale from 1-10...we usually do between 5-7...it's the perfect spice level that the dishes aren't so hot that you can't appreciate the flavor of the dish that you're about to enjoy!!!",

Yeah, the service is really good even though everything feels dodgy. I am really stuck on the Tom Yum Soup hot pot right now and their Thai Tea is really big and super sweet. (It scares me how sweet it is, so much sugar!) This is a pretty low-key simple place and it took a bad experience at another Thai place for me to realize how much I like this place and just how many times I've eaten here and brought guests with nary a bad experience.  They give you generous amounts of food (something I personally get very picky about) and are very convenient in that you can order out. :) They have a nice variety on their menu as well.

Today I was buying food for my family to be delivered and spent about double that. For $50 including tip, I expect good food and the same level of customer service I would get as if I was sitting in the restaurant.   I ordered the beef and meatball soup with large flat noodles like I always do. And like always I ask that they exclude the beef syrups and instead add more meatballs. It's never been a problem until today.   When my order arrived I got two orders of half meatball soups with some type of noodle I didn't ask for. When I called to confirm, I was given the run around and asked that the owner or manager call me back. I was told that the order was a mistake by the girl on the phone but I shouldve only paid $5 per order of soup because it was minus the beef strips. Wrong. I was charged full price.   When I relayed these issues to the owner I was courteous and let him know that the food was always good but that my order wasn't how I normally receive it. He informed me that I had been wrong for close to four years and that they had been screwing up orders for that amount of time as they price is the same whether I order with or without beef strips.   Odd that all of a sudden when I have an issue has everything been wrong all these years.   Customer service was lacking and so shall my business.   I shouldve ordered the pizza instead.",

I asked my waittress to describe what is in them, she had a heavy accent so that did not help either.   I had the Thai Pho, its chicken, which is not advertised. You can ask for meatballs, the waittress said they can remove some chicken to add them. Its a small bowl.  The hot wings looks like a buffalo flavor but its actually sweet chili.

The spicy garlic shrimp was amazing. My friends cashew lemon was sweet (so realistically not my thing). The tofu is firm which for me is a must.   Always checking on your table to refill your glass. They did just change their menu though. They went from a wonderfully nice menu that was large and leather-like, to just little lamented menus you would find at a cheap place. Don't let it fool you. It's still good.   Lastly though, I wish they would change their fish tank. I swear the fish in there are too big for the tank. It makes me sad to look at.",

    "text": "I have had my fair share of Thai Restaurants and Thai House is hands down the best Thai joint in Vegas.  I'm a creature of habit so I come here for one thing only, their Yellow Curry. I've had it with chicken, pork, and beef. All types have been delicious but pork would have to be my favorite. The dish comes with chunks of potatoes, sliced carrots, onions, and white rice on the side. The flavor is so rich and you can definitely taste the coconut milk. The broth itself is far from watery but it's not too thick, I promise you it's absolute perfection. You can choose your spicy-ness level 1-10, I always shoot low because it tends to be spicer than anticipated.   I also love their Thai Beef Jerky appetizer. The texture is far from tough, again the flavor is amazing. Comes with bits of cilantro on top and a side of sauce that's salty with a hint of spice. I'm pretty sure it's fish sauce.  I've been coming to Thai House for a few years now and will continue to do so!",

The decor is authentic, the food is American style but with some unique authentic twists. The service in-store is excellent. We've had the same waitress every time, she's hilarious!   Tom Kha soup - insanely good. Hands down the best soup I've ever had in my life. You'll want to pour it all over yourself, it's just incredible. I get it at a level 5 out of 10.   The only reason for a 4 rating vs 5 is because of their beef dishes - they taste strange to me, but take that with a grain of salt as I am not an avid red meat fan.   Tom Kha soup. Seriously. Do it.",

    "text": "Thai House was off to a bit of a rough start with me when my delivery was a half hour late and my tummy was a grumbling, but other than that little forgivable mishap, I am glad I ordered from here.   The Cashew Chicken was great! They didn't skimp on the cashews, like most places do and they weren't soggy either, like they often can be when ordering delivery. Their Cashew Chicken was colorful and consisted of baby corn, chunky bell peppers (both red and green) and onions, carrots & water chestnuts. I would definitely order the Cashew Chicken again.   A side note: be careful with the spice when you order! I ordered \"extra spicy\" on this dish and it was hot as hell! I loved it but I don't think many could handle that level of spiciness. It was borderline too spicy for me and when it comes to spice tolerance, I'm certifiably insane! So I'd say their scales of hotness are on track with where they should be. You never know with some places. In some restaurants in order to get something extra spicy you have to order EXTRA extra spicy, so I thought it was worth taking a stab at deciphering this restaurant's spicy scale for all the other spice whores out there.  My only disappointment was with the Tom Kha soup because it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. It was still good though. I just probably wouldn't order it again.  I'd say that Thai House is deserving of a little higher than their current 3.5 star rating so I'm going to round up to 4 stars and give them that. I liked my dinner enough to keep them in mind when ordering Thai in the future.",

They literally cut a potsticker in half! And then we got no potstickers with our meal. The pad Thai was spicy but didn't have any flavor and was more bean sprouts than noodles. As far as atmosphere they don't play any music and once in awhile the fish tank filter turns on and rattles loudly while you eat.",

    "text": "First time @ Thai House, my man picked it for his birthday dinner. It was empty inside, no guests. We ordered the same dish, he had the red curry with fried tofu spicy level 4 and I had the red curry with steamed tofu spicy level 10. They swapped our tofu in the spicy levels when the food came out. We figured it out after a few bites... my boyfriend was sweating bullets with his fried tofu and I thought my level 10 was really weak. We then took the tofu out of each of our dishes and swapped our curries.... by the time we did so and attempted to fix it, our dishes were cold and he could still taste the spicy level 10 on his tofu so it didn't help much. We then told our server and we could tell she was confused because to her the dishes looked right (because we swapped them) but my boyfriend insisted that she take them back to remake.... because they did not come out right, they were cold at that point, and he still couldn't eat it because of the spice on his tofu. She kind fought us on it until he was very firm on this request and she realized he wasn't going to take no for an answer. This is very unlike him, he'd never do this but he was furious at her reaction and how unwilling she was to apologize and gladly remake our dishes the correct way. I was shocked at how persistent he was! She grunted when she grabbed the dishes off our table and went to the back. I was worried they'd spit in our meals :( Our dishes came back out, the right way... thank goodness. We ate, they were delicious! But she just hated us after that. No attentiveness, bad service as you can imagine, she was eating with her coworkers in the corner. We packed the rest of our meals to go and she just brought our check, didn't even offer dessert or anything. We wouldn't have gotten any because we were so full.... but it was his birthday!!!! What if he did want dessert?!! What if we brought friends and family here and wanted to sing and celebrate?! Because they messed up our meals, she's mad at us?!!!!??! It was a salty end to his day and it made me upset that she never tried to turn it around. Shame, because the food was good! Guess we'll stick with Pin Kaow or Lucky Thai.",

How about the days where you feel too lazy to even shower and can't bear to pick up the phone to call in a take out order?   Just me?   Anyway, I have these days.  I call them Sundays.  Sundays are often days where I need to just be able to jump on my laptop, fill out what I want to eat on the computer during a Mad Men commercial break, and have it appear at my door as if by magic (Gasoline, how does it work?)  To be brutally honest though, this is the only reason I ever eat Thai House.  The food is always decent, but rarely spectacular.  My favorite dishes so far have been the curries, namely Panang with Pork (the Red and Green were also good).  I've been unimpressed with most of the noodle dishes thus far (Pad See Ew in particular), and the Tom Yum soup was lacking when I've had it a few times.    So stick with the Curries and order in between your episodes of Game of Thrones and the Killing and let Thai House handle the rest.   But put some pants on before you answer the door for heaven's sake.",

First, upon the arrival of my food the deliver driver was careless with my order so that all the sauce that my food was cooked in spilled out of the container and was all in the bottom of the bag soaking my rice and soup in it's juice. So i ordered the Chinese's broccoli with salty fish and it was disgusting. The broccoli was extremely greasy and the fish was over cooked and hard and still had PLENTY of bones left in it. Then i order the egg flower soup which . . . \"sigh\" . . . was so sad it can't even be called soup. It had absolutely no flavor and was EXTREMELY thick and gooey. I just smh and pushed it to the side, giving up on tonights dinner. Most disgusting and unsatisfying thai food I have ever had in my life. The best thing that came out of my order was my thai tea .",

The spring rolls were fresh with a sweet dipping sauce. Tom Yum soup, fresh lemon taste. For the soup, ordered the heat at a 5 out of 10 and there was some definite heat...  No complaints on the chow main or orange chicken.  One of the best entrees sampled was the Chicken Curry- pieces of chicken breast sauteed and stirred into light curry coconut sauce.  Found out you can also order online and delivered.  I'll be back again, hopefully the service will improve.",

Thai House is quite possibly one of the most convenient, partly one of the most cost effective and yummy Thai food eateries in my neck of the woods (if you're ordering the lunch specials that is).   Little things in life excite me so the mere fact you can order your lunch online and pick it up with little to no waiting involved brings an immediate smile to my face! Who likes waiting? I don't.  Food. YUM! The portions are more than generous, flavors consistently delicious, always a friendly staff and convenient for my lunch and dinner dining excursions. My only gripe is the inconsistent levels of heat. A spice level (3) one day may not be the same as a spice level (3) another day.  All in all Thai House is a great eatery if you're in the area, and an especially good deal if you can take advantage of their superior lunch specials and special lunch pricing.  Give it a whirl y'all",

We ordered our usual, mint chicken and chicken panang curry. The mint chicken was OK(they use ground, chopped chicken for this dish), but after a few bites of the chicken panang curry, we both agreed that the chicken in the panang curry tasted spoiled, and had spit out our food on a napkin. Even the rice was old(it was very dry and yellowish, like it's been in the rice cooker for a few days)! I called the server over and brought the issue to her attention. While she was taking the chicken panang curry away, she asked if we wanted something else. At this point, we're already disgusted and just wanted to leave. I handed the server my credit card to pay and told her, \"We better not be charged for the chicken panang curry.\" Lo and behold, the witch charged me for the disgustingly, spoiled chicken panang curry. I've never in my life done this before, but I didn't sign the credit card receipt nor left a gratuity for the horrendous service and inedible food! I already disputed this charge with my credit card company! NEVER AGAIN!!! BEWARE, EVERYONE!!! This place better be glad that I'm a very busy person, otherwise I would've contacted the Health Department! GROSS!",

After my two star review a few weeks back I received a very apologetic email from the owner apologizing for our unpleasant visit. What a nice surprise! The owner seemed to really care for my satisfaction and informed me that they found my credit card transaction and was not going to be charged for my lunch. He invited me back to The Thai House to give them a second chance.  This kind of response is what is lacking in business today. I am very grateful for Yelp being a catalyst for business success and customer satisfaction. Thanks to Yelp, I look forward to take the ownership of The Thai House up on their offer and coming back and experiencing the food and service I once loved.",

Called in for a pick up order and while picking up my food, I noticed 2-3 different workers questioning the soup that was brought out. Only now do I realize that they KNEW what came out wasn't Tom Yum Chicken noodle soup but STILL told me that's what it was, so I trusted their word because why not? Maybe they continued to say it was Tom yum because it was less than an hour before closing and didn't want to remake the food? Maybe they thought I wouldn't know the difference? I got home to open my soup and inside there's chicken and two different types of meatballs in it. It had a sweet and sour taste with peanuts in it. The soup was good, but definitely NOT what I ordered. I have no idea what kind of soup it was at all. All Tom yum soup I've ordered had mushrooms and tomatoes and this soup had none of that. Although the \"mystery\" soup I received was good, I was very disappointed in the service. I wish I got the right soup. I'm sure it would have been good.",

It takes me about 2 minutes to eat the crab wontons & egg rolls they are so perfectly made. I'd like to try another app soon, but have been in love w/ these for awhile.  Also the lunch time special is a great deal.  Soup, egg rolls & your entree.

Thai food just isn't the same here as it is where I've had it before in New York.  Updated to 4 stars based solely on their curry dishes.   This place was pretty decent. Coming from NYC, I've always been exposed to the best of ethnic cuisines. I had high hopes for this place since I haven't found a Thai place I really like yet.   We ordered tom yum, Thai BBQ chicken, Thai house fried rice, and the fresh rolls.   Tom yum was ok, it wasn't sour enough.  The Thai BBQ chicken was $10 for a half and very overpriced for almost tasteless chicken. It was also very dry.  The fried rice was probably the best thing that we ordered. It was flavorful and had a good amount of meat in it. The fresh rolls were a big disappointment. They were made with tofu instead of the traditional shrimp. They also used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine.    For lack of options, I'll be coming back.",

My favorites here are the White Cabbage Soup that comes with napa , glass noodles with chicken or pork & green onions. Both chicken and pork are great. It's a super flavorful light soup.   I always order the Fresh Rolls. They're big and filled with vegetables, fried tofu & seasoned glass noodles with sweet chili peanut sauce. They're even better the next day.   The Satay and beef jerky are also great. So many yummy menu items!   I've tried all of the curries, I definitely like the Masaman Curry the best! It's the one with curry paste, coconut milk, potato & peanuts. It's good with any protein but I opt for the fried tofu. Another dish that's even better the next day!  Favorite noodle dish is Pad Kee Mao, I love the flat noodles. The spice is always on point here and CONSISTENT! Love that!   Ohh get sticky rice! Sticky rice is fun. It's even fun to say!  Who doesn't love sticky food?!   Bonus!! You get two free fried egg rolls when you spend more than $25 on a take out or delivery order. So basically, I get free egg rolls every single time lol.

I generally love getting the Tum Yum (with shrimp) (I ordered this at I Am Thai, and it was so sweet and terrible, so I only get it here now) and the beef jerky when I come here.  The menu has spelling errors all over it, but that is part of the charm.  The service is usually bad, especially if you get the older female, but it is not entirely terrible.  You just might get ignored or it might take awhile before you get served.  However, given the price point and the quality of the food, it is very good.  My wife likes to order the curry dishes here.  They are good, although nothing special and similar to what you can get at the other Thai places in the neighborhood (although not as good as Lotus with its specialty Northern Thai dishes, Arawan is also excellent).   We also tried the pad see ew, which was okay (I like Le Thai's better, also its awesome noodles).    Anyway, five stars for the Tum Yum Soup and the beef jerky.  3 stars for the service.  The singers were annoying at first, but now it is part of the charm.",

Unfortunately, I think this may be the last time we eat here.  Ordered food for delivery and 1.5 hours later we still have no food.  Called the restaurant and are told that the driver will be here in 15-20 minutes.  Ummm...we live right down the street.  Apparently they forgot to make our food.  This is just the last in a long string of crappy service.  When you dine in, everything always takes FOREVER.  And the servers are never very friendly.  For the price and quality of the food, I would suggest that you get your Thai fix elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is my regular Thai restaurant. My good friend introduced me to the place when I was pregnant with my second son. I ate chicken yellow curry and coconut eggroll all the time. That could have been the cause of my 200lb pregnancy. And yes my baby only weighted 6lbs.  1. This place is located in a strip mall next to Smith's. Easy to access and always lots of parking available.  2. The decor is very traditional Thai, spacious, and lots of seating. It's also very clean which is very important to me.  3. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive making sure to bus dishes, refill water, and wrap up our leftovers.  4. The food:  Tom Khaa soup w/ chicken- the chicken was perfect, the flavor had the right amount sweet and sour plus creaminess. I took home the leftovers and ate with rice noodles the next day. OMG!  Beef salad w/ side of sticky rice- I love the beef salad here.  The dressing is always done right, steak is thinly sliced, vegetable is always fresh and with sticky rice on the side. That's a winning combination.  I can't remember the name of the noodles. I seen the pics on yelp and it said award winning noodles of 2011, so that's what I asked for. My older boy enjoyed it but it wasn't for me. It was to oily and had a funny taste to me. Maybe I'm more of a pad Thai kind of girl. I recommend giving it a try and see what you think. If it was voted award winning 2011 I must be wrong.  Chicken Yellow curry- I always order this everywhere I go. It wasn't watery and had the right consistency that is sits nicely on rice. The curry flavor is always done right and you can taste the different spicy they put into the curry.  Thai tea- its always amazing here and it has the perfect sweetness. I usually have this at the Vietnamese restaurants I go to. I guess if you want it done right go to a Thai restaurant.  Mango & strawberry boba- the boys enjoyed it but it tasted like what I would imagine a car air freshener would taste like. Boba was on the gummy side. They all liked my Thai tea better.   All and all this is a good restaurant and they offer delivery and carry out. Try out for yourself you'll be pleased.",

Favorites! 1) Crunchy egg rolls - Crunchy - Yummy 2) Tofu Pan Nang- Cocunut and curry based with veggies and tofu...my FAVORITE. 3) Padsieu noodles- beefy flat noodles with sliced beef. It is really good. 4) Tom Ka soup - spicy soup with coconut juice added. You can add chicken or beef..ext. Soooo good. 5) Chicken Satay - OMG the peanut butter sauce is amazing. If no one was looking I would just eat it up all by itself. YUM  This is by far the best Thia restaurant on the east side of Vegas. Food is always good, service is always good and if you are lucky they have live music (usually on the weekends)  BEST DEAL- they have awesome lunch specials for (~$5-7) for soup, egg roll, chicken wing and meal. Must go!  Love this place.....it's a restaurant staple in my books.",

Perhaps because I was with kids, and started with a wonton soup instead of Tom Yam, they assumed I wanted no heat level in the spice.  2.  I had a very hard time to hear the waitress over the loud music. The musician was great, however, I wanted to talk to my guests and it was a bit harder to do with the music.  3.  Ordered Wonton Soup, Rad Na, Red Curry Chicken, Masaman Curry Beef, and this most awesome half chicken fried. Not really a Thai dish, but a delicious fried chicken delicate and flavorful.  4.  They have a lot of Chinese food here in case you have to be careful wifh some of your guest and this is awesome. Some of their chinese dishes are absolutely great. How many places do you know you can get steamed fish?? That is special.  5.  Service overall was nice. I may have had a younger or new waitress, but also a more senior waitress came by during key times and she was very efficient!  I love the decor and the location. Parking is easy and not very busy for a Saturday night.  I am coming back here, because I think I was tired, a bit full from lunch still, and was trying different stuff.  This place seems like it will be a 4-5 the next time I come back.  Check it out and try it, you will be pleased!",

(A man was singing and playing his guitar and was older, but damn good and singing and playing, he took requests for songs during his breaks).  Service was prompt and friendly.  We ordered a few dishes to share family-style.  Ordered a couple appetizers and 4 different entrees including yellow curry, shrimp with asparagus, spicy bean sprouts, and duck.    1. Yellow Curry - not the best I've had, but very tasty 2. Shrimp with asparagus - I don't really like asparagus, but my family members enjoyed it 3. Spicy Bean Sprouts - very tasty with just a hint of spicyness, the bean sprouts were cooked but still had a crunch consistency... i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this dish 4. Duck - SALTY! but being that I'm on high-protein diet, I ate it all regardless (I was thirsty for the rest of the night)  All in all, the meal was affordable and the portion sizes are more than adequate.  I honestly would come back for the curry and the atmosphere on a Saturday is one that I recommend experiencing for yourself.  There are other thai restaurants out there but for an area deficient of decent asian restaurants, Thai House is a good option.",

    "text": "Another Thai restaurant in a strip mall was what I thought as we pulled up, opened the door and stepped inside, yup just as I thought same old same old. We were graciously greeted and quickly seated at our table, handed our ice water and menus and were left alone while we looked at the menu. The menu is quite large but broken up into appetizers, vegetables, curry's, noodles & rice, seafood, entrees, salads and soups. There were 5 of us so we ordered one green curry, one yellow curry, pad Thai noodles, spicy chili mint and tom yum soup, all ranging from 5 to 8 on their spicy scale. First to come out of the kitchen was the soup, looked OK but the taste was fantastic, the chicken was moist and tasty, the lemongrass just lingered on your tonuge and the spiciness was just enough to give you a bit of heat but not too over powering, and there was enough for 5 of us and more. The yellow and green chicken curry was very flavorful with generous chunks of potatoes, carrots and lots of nice white meat chicken.  The pad Thai noodles were probably the best I have ever had in Las Vegas, all the other pad Thai noodles I have had in Las Vegas have been a little on the greasy side, not these, the noodles were perfectly cooked not mushy and the spice was spot on, just enough but not too much. The best thing out of everything was the chicken spicy chili mint, nice diced chicken over a large bed of vegetables and the portion was huge, we had a number 8 on the spice scale and it was just fine. For such an average looking place in a strip mall, I would say the food, service and the cost was WAY better than some of the other fancy Thai places in town. Oh and one more thing, they deliver too....Win Win in my book.",

The pad thai, however, was quite possibly the worst I've ever had. I was very hungry and did not have high expectations, but even still, it was terrible. The flavor was strange and not appetizing. Super bland. I paid almost $30 for my delivery including tip. SO disappointed. I took 3 bites and could not finish it. Going to bed hungry.",

I never really craved for Thai food but after eating here I want it again . I ordered pineapple fried rice, crab rangoon, beef pad thai, and beef ball noodle soup... all were fantastic.  Crab Rangoon was well presented and fully stuffed and crispy on the outer wrap. Delicious.  Beef Pad Thai delicious as always.  Beef ball noodle soup was also delicious!  Pineapple fried rice was my favorite! So flavorful and the cashews really added a nice savory crunch.  Defiantly will be returning!",

    "text": "For months I've been meaning to visit Thai House as I have lunch many times in this plaza.  I'd forget, because it is all the way in the back corner. I finally scheduled myself to visit on this particular day.  I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after it opened at 11 am.  So when I got there, there was plenty of parking.  I walked in and my first impression was, not bad, a mix of Thai and Chinese decor.  The ladies that greeted and seated me were very nice. So great customer service, right off the bat.  Where i was seated, I was surprised to see the vinyl on the middle part of the seat, where your knees would normally go, was torn :(  That's the first I've ever seen since moving to Las Vegas. My natural instinct was to look for other things.  My eyes were drawn to the wall as they had new dish items listed which were reasonably priced.  Because the menu on the wall drew my attention, it also drew my attention to the soy sauce splattered on the wall.   As i flipped the menu to find the lunch specials. I was glad to see that their specials start at $7.99 and includes egg roll and your choice of soup.  I figured, this is my first time, let me try something that I know which would allow me to compare the dish to others. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken, one of my all time favorites.  While waiting for my order, I go to the restroom.  The restroom is in the back of the restaurant where you have to walk past the kitchen and where all the cleaning stuff is at.  I get to the restroom where I can immediately see two stalls because the door is propped wide open.  It makes going to the restroom a little uneasy when you hear men working.  The restroom, for the most part is clean.  However, it isn't difficult to see the missing tiles on the floor.  Let's talk about the food since the experience so far is turning me off.    Best thing that I tried was their egg roll.  Egg drop soup and fried rice was a little more on the bland side, while the Pad Thai was just ok.  It had a fair amount of chicken, but even that didn't have as much taste.  The dish itself was overly flavorful because it was overly sauced.  One of the big pluses of Thai House, is that they participate in Yelps Cashback program.  So it was nice to see I got a few cents back from this experience.  Atmosphere and cleanliness does make a huge difference in a dining experience.  For now, I'll rate this visit a 2 but I hope to raise this on my next visit.",

I arrived around 105pm (another guest who was getting take out walked in right before me as well) and received no acknowledgement of being in the restaurant.  The place was packed for some kind of event so I was willing to let it slide and figured they'd get to us in a bit.  About 10-15 min had gone by before one of the CUSTOMERS got up out of their seat to grab a waitress for us.  The waitress finally came over to assist us asking if we had called ahead.  We both responded with a yes and then she said, \"okay\" and then walked off.  No explanation of what was going on.  More time goes by and and the gentleman who had arrived before me decided it wasn't worth it and walked out of the restaurant.  The waitress finally made her way back to me and showed me 2 different tickets and asked me which one was mine (first time in my life an employee of a restaurant asked me to look at ticket orders and select which one was mine).  She said, \"okay\" and walked off.  Again, she told me nothing about what was going so I just stood there waiting.  At this point it's 150pm and family was arriving at 2pm so I had to leave.    I called back an hour later (figuring the event had died down a little and I could actually get my food this time) explaining what had happened to the manager.  She apologized and said it was because they were really busy.  She then told me me my food was ready for pick-up and just needed to be reheated and that they would give me an extra 10% off.  I explained to her that I did not want reheated food.  She apologized and said that they would make me a fresh batch and that it would be ready in 15 min.  I instructed her to call me when the food was ready instead (I did not want to show up and have to wait again) and asked if she needed me to repeat the order (she said no).  After calling to tell us the food was ready, my mom went to pick it up.  She comes back to the house and I notice she has nothing with her.  She tells me they had the order wrong and we we're short 2 of the 8 items we had ordered.  She had told them she wasnt going to wait for the order to be fixed and asked them to deliver it us when it was ready.  We got our food at 445pm.  After 2 wasted drives there, 3 hours later, we got our food.",

Then I was ready to order went to the counter, had to call one of the waitress that had braided hair/eye glasses to help me, she ran my card then walked away, I had to ask one nice waitress if I can have my credit card back. When we  left the rude braided waitress was busy putting her makeup on in the dining room instead of helping customers. My last time coming here!

The first time I ordered from here I got the spicy chicken, mint & basil dish and it was simply superb. So were the crab rangoons.   The next time I ordered from here I ordered the same dish. This time is was so salty that I couldn't even enjoy it. Not to mention that most of the broth from the dish had spilled into the delivery bag.  I figured this was a fluke, so I ordered the same dish for a third time (yes, I'm a creature of habit) and kindly let them know that it was too salty the last time. Their solution was to not add ANY seasoning. Omgosh- no. It was like eating water, but sweet water because I guess to make SURE it wasn't too salty they added sugar? *face palm*  Then I figured I'd give them one last chance and try a different dish: Thai fried rice. *sigh*  After waiting for over an hour for my food to arrive, when it finally came it tasted like basic fried rice that one would get from Panda Express. Not a drop of thai flavoring at all.   Unfortunately I had to flush it down the toilet....along with the menu.",

I entered the restaurant and waited 5 minutes then I decided to sit at a table b the restaurant was 35% full.  I waited.   No one came to my table.  So I went to another table and told the manager where I was sitting. I decided to use the restroom and then when I got to my table I waited for another 5 minutes.  I finally got a waiter after waiving.  Then I asked about some items on the menu like any decent customer would.  To my surprise the waiter was quite rude.  It was my first time in this restaurant and he made me feel like a dumb idiot without knowledge about the menu.    The restroom was filthy and a dust pan and broom was sitting right in the middle of the dining floor.  The tables I sat on were sticky and the restaurant smelled like old food.  Yuk!!!    I am a businessman with 24,000 monthly regular customers.  I could have given them 50 more customers a month but being treated like a rotten customer during his first time is not a good experience.    The chubby short haired Thai waiter has to be fired or retrained.    I am never coming back.    This business will close in a short time.",

I placed a to go order for chicken yellow curry and was SPECIFIC and adamant that my curry spice level be no more then a level one.   When I got home it was beyond spicy ( think level 9 or 10 ) to the point where I could not eat it neither could my roommate. Unfortunately they were closed so I could not call until today.   When I did call back to let them know that I still had a full container of yellow curry that was too spicy and that was not what I ordered, the older lady who was working during the day was so rude to me.   She said their spicy level was already cooked into the yellow curry and starts at a level 3 or 4. Wait what??? This woman on the phone was so filled with unpleasantness.The way she spoke to me was rude, aggressive and very unfriendly. I told her nobody told me that information on the phone last night when I placed the order for the curry and had I known I would have never ordered.   She then told me there was nothing they could do and basically made it out that is was my fault. I have never dined at a Thai restaurant that did not let you choose your own level of spiciness. I have a full container of yellow curry sitting in my fridge that I guess I will have to throw out now just like my hard earned money wasted on this mediocre place.  I would sincerely advise anyone that is thinking about dining or getting a to go order here to go support another Thai restaurant in the area. The customer service here plays by their own rules and does not care about the customer at all. It is very disheartening that there is a business open that operates under this level of dishonesty.

Dinner is a good (larger) portion with slightly higher prices and no soup included. I love soup so for dinner I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, they have chicken and beef ( and tofu I think) but never thought it should be with anything but shrimp. It is a great tasting soup, hot with big shrimp (:)) and lots of flavor.  For dinner I had the garlic cashew chicken. A big plate with white rice. Delicious. I would have preferred a little more garlic in a sauce but it was a good meal with a little of leftovers for the next day.  What made the meal better was the lady and gentleman singing karaoke on the small stage. They really enjoyed singing and it made dinner very enjoyable. I am not sure if they are there every night ( I was there on a Tuesday?) but it really made for a good time. The gentleman told me I was welcome to come up and sing but I wouldn't want to ruin everyone's dinner that way! It is one of those things I have seen on tv but never been to before. Keep up the great work guys, I will swing by next time I am in town.",

    "text": "My family and I have been going to this restaurant for about 10 years. We would eat here on almost all occasions. They let us have a party before and use the stage to sing as well. I would rate the food about 3.5-4 stars depending on what you get. Fried rice and Pad Thai haven't disappointed so far. 5 stars for service because the waitresses are always extremely nice and they're pretty fast on bringing the food out. Cleanliness of the restaurant and the quiet ambiance of the place is a plus. I love their lunch specials! It's pretty cheap for all the food you get. Overall, 4 stars.  However, I'm going to have to rate it 3 stars now from what happened yesterday. It was a rainy day so we thought it would be cool to just get the food delivered for the first time. It took about an hour and that's pretty early for them because they said it should take 1-1.5 hours. Ouch...worst decision ever since we live down the street. They charge $5 to deliver. All of those are still pretty understandable. I got 2 orders of Chicken Pad Thai over the phone and she repeated the order clearly to confirm it. However, they ended up delivering 2 orders of Chicken Satay and one order of Chicken Pad Thai. At this point, I'm crawling on the floor from starvation and all the frustration, but I still have to be considerate because it was an honest mistake. I called to let them know what happened. The girl on the phone was really nice and was sorry but her boss clearly said that they want us to return the 2 orders of Chicken Satay back. Umm okay? Are they going to recycle it and give it to a different customer? That was extremely odd. 30 minutes later, the delivery man came back to give us the other order of Chicken Pad Thai. He took back the other 2 orders of Chicken Satay and opened the boxes to check if we touched or ate any! What is up with that? There was no accommodations made except for fixing the charges on my credit card. They acted like it was our mistake and did it on purpose. I just hope that they don't give the food that we returned to a different customer since they were so determined to take it back and make sure that it was untouched. 1 star for the experience but it was the first time it happened and they have been so good to me for years, so 3 stars overall.",

    "text": "I believe all families have a restaurant that they frequently go to. It's considered the \"usual\". You know what I mean, that place that becomes not only a dining experience, but a family tradition where random dinners or celebrations take place. Memories are build and as a result, a soft spot is grown in one's heart. Hate to sound cheesy, but it's True. And for my family, Thai House became that place in Las Vegas.   Thai House delivers good food in a somewhat campy environment. Despite having the same cuisine as Pin Kaow, Thai House isn't clad in sleek design and intimate lighting. Instead, you have a mini dance floor, television screens promoting karaoke, and tacky decorations. I always see the same friendly hostess, who is kinda loud and recognizes us. She seems to have the best grasp of the English language and handles a lot of the front dining. Fun fact:  my family came in during a session where an elderly man in a Hawaiian shirt was singing 80's love ballads. Awkward and hilarious at the same time. Such caveats might cause people to leave, but I've learned to embrace the ridiculousness and just roll with it.   As for the food, my favorite dishes are their curries, papaya salad (of course), and crispy chicken. They definitely follow the mantra \"the more, the better\". But I think for the most part, the food is delicious. MSG haters/phobics might want to avoid this place, I can't recall if they had a message on their menu regarding this issue. But you should still give it a shot. Who knows, you might see the same old man covering Mariah Carey's \"Hero\".",

Super excited about the fact that they actually deliver - and for a very small, reasonable fee. And you can order online - major bonus in my world.  The food was delivered in just over 30 minutes. The packaging was great. No dripping or leaking. Plenty of chopsticks, silverware packets, sauces, and fortune cookies. And two free crunchy egg rolls!  The egg rolls were very delicious. Easily some of the best egg rolls I have ever had.  The two entrees we ordered were rather unadventurous, but were solidly delicious. The spicy garlic and pepper beef was pretty much just what you would expect. The sweet chili chicken was a big winner with us - excellent batter and extremely delicious sauce.   And bonus points for getting the spicy levels just right. (There is a drop-down menu on the online ordering where you can choose how spicy you want each dish you order.)  Overall, a very solid delivery experience. One day, we may make it into the actual restaurant. (Perhaps for the karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights?)",

Once inside and unpacked, the aroma wafting through my kitchen was nothing short of magical. The Chicken fried rice was for my husband, who has a limited pallet. I'm sure it was delicious, as he didn't complain. The duck curry was fall of the bone good. Just enough spice to cause, as we New Yorkers say, as schvitz. I enjoyed almost everything in the sampler except the egg/spring roll things. I just didn't care for those. My coffee was/is delightful. I will absolutely order from here again for several reasons: online ordering convenience, timely delivery, and the AMAZING FOOD!!",

    "text": "It was great to be able to find a cute little Thai restaurant (at the recommendation of a good friend from High School) to be able to visit while I am home in Las Vegas (going through withdrawals from Thai Taste in New Haven, CT).   There are a few dishes that I really just am a sucker for on any given Thai menu, and therefore use them as standards by which to judge the various restaurants. Tom Yum Goong, which is a clear broth soup made with lemon grass, mint, and chili paste and really just is a fantastic starter encapsulating the various flavor combinations which Thai food has become famous for incorporating. Here, they did not have a small, single person serving (lest you wanted this as a whole meal, versus just as a soup on a cold day), but it was so flavorful, I did not mind (nor did the other people at the table who, unbegrudgingly ate their portion).   As an entree, I love the noodle dishes, and close to my heart is the Yai Kee Ma-Ow (read: drunken noodles). Here they were chewy and had just the right amount of sauce to coat the noodles, but not to leave them swimming in excess. I ordered them with pork... oh pork, how I love you... which was just on the right side of crispy without being overdone.   Finally, for dessert, it does not matter what Asian inspired restaurant one visits, it seems that they all have banana spring rolls... though here we had, what we were told, was homemade coconut ice cream to boot! Yum!",

For that price, you can get your choice of entree  (such as beef panang, sesame chicken or kung pao chicken) with a choice of either fried rice or white rice, a small (but delightfully crunchy) fried spring roll, a seemingly pointless chicken wing, and a small soup (which, as another yelper pointed out, is hard to describe as anything but weak, but remedied by chili sauce). I recommend the beef panang - you'll be blown away.  Service is speedy although not exactly \"friendly.\" Quick with refills on water and to clear finished plates, the two servers that I've had were extremely efficient. I find that in this city, servers fall into one of three categories: overly-friendly and attentive, making sure they are part of your dining \"experience\"; attentive but making themselves more part of the background and allowing the food to make-or-break the meal; and downright rude. I would say the ladies who have served me here fall into the second category, and perhaps with their traditional Thai wardrobe, they are meant to be more part of the environment as a whole than overshadow it.  I'll update sometime after I visit during dinner - or who knows, even karaoke one of these weekend nights.",

The server took our plates to the back then came back a few minutes later to put them in boxes. Why did she bring them to the back before bringing them back to us??? We took them and threw them in the garbage outside. *bad service *mediocre food (being nice) *everything took way too long *questionable to go packing method It was just bad enough for me to never go there again.  That's why I give them 1 star.  2 stars just means I've had better but there was a panda express in the same shopping center that would be a better choice.",

Now, I'm not on e to rave about how great a dish is, but every time I come here I alway order a particular dish. If you're big fan of pork, then strap your seat belts and get ready cause this will be the best pork dish you ever had. Are you ready for it? (*drum roll please*) it's the deep fried pork belly with Chinese broccoli. Regardless of the season or day, the flavor for this dish remains the same. It's salty yet mildly sweet flavor pork stir fried with a crunchy tasting Chinese brocolli, is almost too good to pass up when ordering. I'm also a big fan of their beef pad seew, the flavor is ground breaking mixed with scrambled egg and Chinese broccoli sauteed with the thick cut noodles and that incredible sauce, this review is making me salivate at the thought of it. The curry here is amazing too, my personal favorite is the green curry and the yellow curry, both served with white rice makes the dish seem almost complete.   The service here isn't too bad, and they have no problems when it comes to splitting the check. The interior decoration seems Thai like, it has that Asia sense feel to it. The tables are good to fit a big party, and once you arrive you're sat down almost immediately. Drop by here if you can, I promise you.....you won't regret it!",

    "text": "I gave this restaurant one star because the delivery was actually early, it was convenient to order online, and finally the first bite of the tum yum soup was fairly good.  However, after eating the second bite it was just good and by the third bite it was ok and then by the fourth bite I wanted to throw up.   The Red Curry Chicken was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life.  It tasted like coconut milk straight with some added seasoning and the chicken thrown into a mess of a dish.  After traveling through thailand and other asian countries like Singapore (who knows how to do it right) I can sometimes be snobbish about my thai food.  Usually when I order thai food in the United States I keep in mind that it is not Thailand.  However, this restaurant is far beyond saving.  I would give it some kind of constructive criticism but the only thing that comes to mind is ... close the doors!",

I can't say one bad thing. Everything tastes awesome!! Flavorful, spicy and hot. Adding fried tofu to any dish makes a great veggie option for all of us vegetarians. A must for all Thai lovers!",

You can bring a large group or you can sit at booths along the sides of the large, clean, divided room.  Seating is far enough apart to not give you a crowded feeling.  The decor, though colorful is a tad on the low-cost, plain side, but that is no problem since you come here for a tasty, affordable meal.  The menus are \"bound\" in colorful fabric with metallic threading. The waitresses are pleasant and personable and dress in colorful Thai clothing.    There is a variety of foods on the menu, mostly Thai but with some recognizable Chinese offerings. Most meals seem to range from around 8 dollars to perhaps 15 but you could order an appetizer for less.  I was a little short on cash but had no problem finding something for 8.95 (a delicious curry).  I will definitely come back and bring friends.  By the way, there is ample parking in the large plaza.  Update 2/278/08  They have updated their design to include musical entertainment in the form of karaoke and professional performers. For a while they've had a sign touting their house performer, \"Skip Eaton (\"skip eatin'? I don't know if a guy with a name like that should be performing in a restaurant).  Everything else is the same - great food, friendly waitstaff.",

The location is a bit hidden, tucked way back in the corner of the Smith's shopping center.  Each time we come in, I have never seen it packed either lunch or dinner.  The place is roomy and has a stage for live music.  We were seated promptly and our service was excellent.  I didn't have to sit with an empty water glass for long and the food arrived quickly, A+ on service.  After searching in Henderson for a good Fresh roll, I may have found it here at the Thai house.  I highly recommend them!   I also had some Orange Chicken and some Moo Poo Gai Chicken which were both very good.  In the past, I've had some of their fried rices and sometimes they can be hit or miss, I usually like these from elsewhere.  The soups are amazing here,  I really enjoy their Egg Drop, very tasty.    An order of Orange Chicken, Moo Poo Gai Chicken, Fresh Rolls (4), a small Cucumber Salad and an Egg Drop soup (all of this food wasn't all just for me, I swear!  :P) ran about 36 bucks.  A lot of food, but still a bit on the pricy end.  Very good quality, I highly recommend this place if your are in the mood for Thai.",

But it was not the first time I found something other than food in my plate.   The very first time I found  hair, which I understand, hair can be dropped in food very often. So I continue to go back because they do make good food. Plus it is just 3 minutes drive from my house.   And today, I ordered some togo again. 2 items, I found a rock in my salad, the size of half of a peanut in my food. And I thought to myself, it is ok, maybe the rock is in the veggie and didn't rinse thoroughly. So I finish the first box.  And when I try to have my 2nd item, I saw this on the box. (Please refer to the picture) I am sure this is a piece of broken leg of some kind of bug. And I totally lose my appetite to even open that box.   I thought I can put up with hair and rock in my food. But for the leg of some unknown insect sticking to a Togo box. I guess I just need to find other place that is more cautious about their food. It was sad cause they do make tasty food.",

Let me do say that their Thai iced tea size is pretty generous and their Duck Salad is a must try, probably the highlight of my visits. The chicken satay is decent (dry on some days) and their fried rice doesn't taste authentically Thai to me. Every dish is missing that wow factor and even though it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable at the same time.  The service was friendly. 100%. But never really touched the table enough after that after realizing that our food is taking a long time. Service can be spot on as I'm noticing other tables wondering why no one has approached them either. Service at Thai restaurants are usually pretty genuine but sometimes an extra body on the floor can help with the basic touches it'll take for a customer to come back. Repeatedly.",

    "text": "I used to live in the Henderson area and randomly saw this golden find. Happy to say that trying it once landed me a go-to place for my Thai fix!   Thai House Restaurant is a very nice, intimate spot. I would consider it almost like fine dining (wine-type glasses for water and cloth napkins), yet with affordable pricing. Thai House is the first Thai restaurant I tried when I moved to Las Vegas in September 2014, and it is so good that I refuse to waste my time trying anything else! I've had their papaya salad, yellow curry, and pad thai-- all amazing. Plus, on top of high-quality, delicious food, their customer service is outstanding! I've been here five times and within every visit, I'm seated immediately with water served/drink orders taken right away. The food comes out very quickly too, and they check on you multiple times to make sure everything is ok, then are quick to replenish your needs (as all great servers should do).   Side note: most of their entrees are spiced from 1-10. I have a very low tolerance for spicy food, so if you are like me but want a tiny kick, a 2 should suffice.",

Nothing was comped (honestly this isn't that big of a deal, but there were literally cockroaches on the wall... You'd think they'd want to bribe us into not telling anyone) and we will never return.    I apologize for taking so long to write the review, I just felt bad thinking about what could happen to their business, but I recently told a friend about the experience who convinced me I should.",

They have a speedy delivery service. However, it is time to redo the menus. When we dine in, the menus are so old and crusty I don't even want to touch them. They are falling apart, have old food particles on then, stick together, and still list dishes they no longer serve and haven't served for a while. I would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky, but it's not. It's just plain tacky. If they removed some of the clutter and spent a little to spruce things up, it would breathe new life in here. But I digress, because the food is in fact good.",

    "text": "I come to Vegas every couple months and am always in search of that hidden gem.  The place that isn't flashy or touristy but that is the real deal.   The place that will show up on Triple D and I can tell Bleached Guy F. \"Yea bro, been there\"  this trip I got to find that.  Friends suggested Thai House and I was so ooooh glad they did.  Don't let the typical Vegas shopping strip location fool you...when you walk in you notice it's different.  It's big.  It has a stage that I hear parties can use for karaoke or that the owners son may come out to do a bongo solo (he's about 3 and adorable) or a local entertainer will have fun with the crowd.    Kinda kitschy but the real gem is the food.  I ate with friends and we decided to do a family style deal to which the staff were more then happy to accommodate. ..in fact we let them choose the menu and it was the best decision I made in a long time.  From the Tom Cha  Gui soup that came with its own heating element to keep it hot...to the beef salad...to the green curry...to the   spicy chili and mint pork...we really liked everything.  The best and I'm embarrassed I can't remember the name (Shanghai noodles maybe...thin with chicken) they were great.  A big deal with Thai food is \"how much heat?\".  We went from 4 to 8 (which was a nice burn but you need to like heat).  I read some of the reviews that talk about it taking some time to get their food.  We asked for things to be brought out as they were ready and it worked out brillantly...they seem to care more about quality then speed which I am completely behind.    So in short if you're in Vegas and want to find real good Thai food...in a family run and oriented restaurant...take the time to visit.",

I had been at the pool all day so the last thing I wanted was to have to work for my dinner. However, we ordered the orange chicken for my nephew and it was great. Lightly breaded in tempura. There were four of us at the table and we all agreed it was by far the best orange chicken any of us had eaten.   I just ordered the red chicken curry with chicken for takeout. The portion was a very good size, bigger than I expected.   At first I was a little annoyed that they charged me .75 cents to use my credit card because my order was under $10. However, the food was pretty good, so I not really worried about the charge.   Pro tip: First time online orderes get 10% off.",

Then it went downhill from there. They also serve Chinese American food - not recommended. We ordered the Panang curry, pad Thai, and thai BBQ chicken. Each combo comes with rice, soup, appetizer (egg roll and won ton - fried Costco) - but for 6.99$ it's a bargain. The Panang and Pad Thai were good. The Thai BBQ chicken tasted like Indian Tandoori (not good). Then they were besieged by the lunch rush.  Flocks of folks came in one after another at noon. I guess other folks want the bargain deals. Most of them were Caucasian or Mexican-- so you can guess on quality and taste.  I would suggest the nearby Full House BBQ. Better food and comparable prices. They are not open on Monday/Tuesday.  Hence why we ended up here. Again, not bad if you are on a budget, portions are decent.  But don't expect to be rocked with flavor.",

The hostess counter wasn't being used, but it wasn't busy, and the cashwrap area was in the back near the kitchen. Guess it doesn't matter though because the waitress/hostesses bring your check to their patrons and all.  Our hostess turned out to also be our waitress, and she was super nice. She didn't do much to chat with us, but she'd check up on us several times during the meal. I'd like to describe her personality as genuinely bubbly.  I think the manager also came to talk to us a bit - she was also greeting and seating groups as the dinner hour progressed. She was also nice and courteous. This Thai restaurant isn't like any other that I've been to. For instance, you have to ask them to make your Thai dishes spicy.  I had the Beef Pad Thai and Lychee Boba, the boyfriend had the Chicken Pad See Ew, and we had steamed pot stickers for an appetizer. The pot sticker plate was still wet from the steam, but it came with a good sauce for extra flavoring. The Pad Thai was yummy. Didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was without adding spice, and I liked the beef 'cause it was marinated well before being cooked. The Boba was really good! It really did taste like Lychee, so I'm definitely happy it wasn't like some kind of powdered flavor. The Pad See Ew was also different without adding spice to it, but I didn't like it as much, so... Our next visit here, I'll be sure to ask them to give it an extra kick (if the boyfriend doesn't beat me to it). It was still cooked well though.",

    "text": "Lets start with the dining area. This place has more than enough seating.  The tables are evenly spaced so you can have a nice conversation within your party.  They have a nice section in the back in the event you have a large party.  They also have a stage where they have live music usually during the weekend evenings.  I love how the place is decorated.    I enjoy the food here.  Nothing special that I would say stands out but the good thing is that its consistent in taste.  They have a large menu so you definitely have a lot of choices. They also have a lunch special during the week day so that definitely is a plus.   The staff is really friendly although some do have a strong accent so you may need to repeat yourselves or ask them to repeat your order just to make sure they got it correct.  They try their best to assist you but I do feel they are under staffed.  When the place gets busy the staff seem to be overworked.  They try their best to serve you but I can see they are sometimes doing too much.  So be weary that during busy times your water or drinks may not be filled timely but the staff is always respectful and treat you very well.   Price for the food is very fair.  It's about the same prices as any Asian restaurant.  Average ala carte dish is about $8.95-$12.95.  The amount of food they give per dish is a good amount.  2 dishes will usually feed a part of 2-3 easily. I do think at times the food takes longer to cook but this gives you time to enjoy a good conversation with your friend or date.  Don't go here if your really hungry and expect to go in and out.   Overall, I do come back and forth to this location many times and quite often do take out as the food is good. Sometimes I do crave their bean sprouts with crispy pork so that dish definitely gets me to come back.  I see the owner here often and he is such a nice fella always sharing his stories.  Talks with his guest.",

The entree choices have the popular thai dishes - curry, pad thai, panang, thai bbq chicken and also a bunch of chinese food entrees - ginger chicken, chow mein, beef broccoli.   I always crave their green chicken curry!! The last time, I thought I could handle a level 7 spicyness but it was soooo spicy! I usually can handle spicy food, but that was SPICAAAY! The next time I think I will get a level 5.  The staff are very nice and service is excellent. They sometimes have live music. Usually at night time. Very big space and a lot of seating areas.   Their take-out service is great too! A definite fave of mine! I'm so glad they are located 5 mins away!",

We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken & Shrimp Pad Kee Mao.  The Pad Kee Mao was excellent, as other reviewers have noted.  We both enjoyed the flavors and the spicyness.  The Pad Thai was not our favorite and I have had much better at other places in town.  It was overhwhelming on the noodles and had very little meat in the dish.  Also, we were a bit dissapointed that we were forced to order an entire entree for our toddler since they do not have children's portions on the menu.",

We Arrived there 30 minutes later and were told the food was not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. Not a great first impression but the waitress did apologize. So I decided to wait in the restaurant... 20 minutes go by and at this point I'm getting irritated... I ask the waitress if our food was ready and she replied with another apology \" it's almost ready.\" About 5 minutes later my food is brought out to me. They obviously forgot to prepare my food until I arrived there. Not good service in my book. Now on to the food.. 1) We decided to try the spicy mint chicken-- it had a layer of oil on the bottom.. Not very appetizing. 2) Vegetable fried rice-- surprisingly was pretty good. 3) Thai Mongolian beef-- very fatty  All in all... The food and service will not have me returning back. Sigh...

Now comes the problem: so I got home with my food. To make long story short: the sweet and sour has onions and the pad se ew has broccoli still. Not fully disappointed, but also not fully impressed. By the way: the  beef in the pad see ew has a rubber texture to it, but really no tastes to it. I just chew and chew. It's kind of like gum, but with no flavor.",

Understandable.   2 hours later I hit RE-DIAL on my phone to make sure its still on the way. The poor woman who I had spoke to earlier on the phone sounded SO frantic trying to figure out the situation. 10 minutes later another woman picks up saying they don't have my order and that I probably called another restaurant... Uhm... pretty unlikely considering I hit re-dial...But it's ok. People make mistakes. I give her my order again including specials and deals (you spend over a certain amount, you get something for free) that I only would have known about if I were looking at THEIR menu! It will be delivered in the next 20 minutes. Awesome. But no apology, no free meal? I found that kind of odd...  The food finally gets to my house 50 minutes later... I explain to the delivery man I was just a little shocked that I would still have to pay after waiting almost 3 HOURS for my food. He throws up his hands saying \"Look lady, you never called us the first time\"... and as if I haven't made it clear by now.... I HIT RE-DIAL!!!! lol. Even after explaining that, he continues to give me a few nonsense excuses and that next time I should order the food online...... and I still had to pay......  The food on the other hand wasn't bad. Which is the only reason why they're getting 2 stars and not 1. A bit on the oily side and only lukewarm.. But if you scoop out the top layer of oil and warm it up yourself, its great. lol.",

Not only do they have outstanding service but the food is always on point and the live music on Friday/Saturday night is quite enjoyable. As you walk in the staff are always right there to greet you and when not busy, able to seat you right away. For starters I always order the Pad Thai Noodles. Which has a small peanut taste but is also a bit tangy and spicy. It comes with your choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. For my main course I always get the Penang Curry, again you have your choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp. This coconut curry dish is served with your choice of white rice, which is the way to go but if you wanna be a tad bit healthy, then you can go with the brown rice. This dish regularly comes out pretty spicy so my advice to you not so spicy lovers, make sure you request it at a level three on their scale of one thru ten. Overall I think all the food here is great, the two dishes I mentioned are always my go to meals especially on a cold nigh out. The prices are pretty decent compared to other thai restaurants in Las Vegas an Henderson. If you're looking for good food and wanting to venture out and try anything other than a burger and fries, why not enjoy the delicious thai quinine at the Thai House. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

I ordered the pad thai, my favorite dish, with a spice level of 7 (Hot!!) and shrimp. The noodles were very good, with a generous amount of peanuts. Since most places skimp on the peanuts first, I was extremely impressed. At first, I was disappointed in the spice level. For a level 7 it was pretty weak; my tongue wasn't even hot. Then, I mixed my pad thai up a bit more... I hit the chili vein. The heat from then on was extreme, not for the weak tongued. The shrimp, however, seemed a little bit soft, maybe undercooked. I also ordered a side of crab rangoons. I LOVE crab rangoons. BUT, I was really disappointed. They had strange herbs in them, which were surprisingly pleasant. They also had onions in them, which was a big no-no for me. I cannot stand onions, and the strange mixture of the onions and the cream cheese was extremely unpleasant. Delivery time was ok, and price was also ok. $23 for the two dishes, delivery charge, tax, and tip. In the end, I would definitely order the pad thai again (maybe a 6), but wouldn't try th rangoons again.",
