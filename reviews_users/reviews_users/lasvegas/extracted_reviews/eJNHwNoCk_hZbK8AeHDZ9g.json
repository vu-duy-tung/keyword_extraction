    "text": "I first tired Nevada Chicken Cafe at their location on Sahara Ave and found the chicken to be dry and the side dishes unappetizing.   After reading my review, the owner Nico invited me to the opening of his second location to give his food another try.   At this location, you stand in line and walk past the food before placing your order at the register. I handed the young female cashier my $25 gift card and she said today we have 30% off so you should save the card. I told her that I wanted to use the card today and she told me I was crazy. She seemed very inexperienced in handling customers.   I wanted to sit inside but the sewage smell was so bad I was forced to sit outside on a very hot day. My friend and I sampled the:  Breast meat- more moist than the other location but still bland and skin had a rubbery texture   Pulled pork sandwich- first pulled pork sandwich I have ever seen on sub sandwich bread. Pulled pork was finely chopped and red onions were random  Mac & cheese- bland, watery, the cheese tasted like it had come from a packet   Baked beans- artificially sweet, tasted like it came from a can  Coleslaw- average coleslaw, I have had better at the grocery store  Watermelon- mediocre  Chocolate chip cookie- hard and ordinary   Nico was busy but I wanted to ask him what inspired him to open a soul food like restaurant when it is not his culture.  Overall the food here is ordinary and the majority of it does not taste homemade.",

The ribs had absolutely no seasoning and were dry. Also we ordered drinks and the whole soda machine had no carbonation so the drinks were flat we asked if they could fix the CO2 and a few other customers complained as well we stayed for about 30 minutes and they did not fix the machine. It was slow in the store so it's not like they were busy. Definitely wasted my money here will not recommend and will not be returning.",

Once I received my take-out order there was no- thanks come back again or have a great day...nothing said at all... food put down in front of me and waitress walked away. I know Vegas doesn't have the best customer service at times... but this by far was the worst that I have ever experienced out here and no doubt will never return. I even witnessed a supervisor or manager having to confront customers over an issue and then take one of the rude employees to the back still within open line sight and hearing to let her know that the behavior was not correct. Be coaching did not seem to help because her attitude appeared to of gotten worse.",

I would describe the flavors as salt and pepper with some additional mild seasonings (there are some self serve BBQ sauce on the side). Both the chicken and ribs were cooked to a nicely crispy outer crust. Just a little dry, so not a lot of fat on either of the meats.  I'd say this is a healthy version of eating ribs. Low sodium, fats, and nothing was burnt.   So long as this place can stay consistent with their cooking, I thought it was fine and I'll return. Price was around $12-$13 for the combo dish.",

Their salad and vegitables are SO fresh and taste amazing. The corn falls off the cob into your mouth just as your teeth come to rest on the kernals. I got the 1/4 rack of ribs and chicken combo. It comes with a small little taster of their garden salad w/italian dressing on the plate (almost like a garnish, but it's delicious!!) and a tortilla..the combo comes with a drink and one side. It was about $15 bucks but I paid about $10 after a $5 off deal from Yelp for checking in. The price seemed a little high for a semi-fast food-ish place like this but after eating the food, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd rather pay that much for THIS food than spend the same amount or maybe even more at a fancy place like Lucille's or even a step down from that at Famous Daves. Try this place!!! It's awesome. Quick, easy and a good balance between heathly food and comfort food. They even have smoothies, fruit salad and desert! I will definitely be back!!",

Some of the chicken still had the gristle attached which for my fighter wasn't good. She said she wouldn't go out of her way to order that again. Wife had the chicken chile bowl, not much chicken and it was more like bean soup than chile. If it had chunks of chicken instead of shredded maybe would have been better.",

My friend and I always ride out here and we have always had great service, the food is great, and it was our favorite spot... UNTIL tonight.  We went in and ordered our food.  My order was a little messed up, nothing major.  Didn't say anything because we assumed the guy at the register was new since we hadn't seen him before, and it was just a little mistake... But then, when he came to pick up our plates after we finished eating the same guy said, \"let me get this shit from ya.\"  And took our plates... That took us back a little bit.  Then, he came back and started to clean the tables behind us.  After he was done, he came up to us and another couple of guys sitting at another table and asked us to go because he was \"trying to get out of there.\"  This was at 9:30pm.  They close at 10p.  We got up, my friend was pissed.  I asked him \"Dont y'all close at 10?\"  He said, oh, \"you dont have to leave, Im just closing this section down because I have to get out of here.\"  We just walked out... He had all the chairs ontop of the table by 9:35p.  WTF?  We've never had such terrible service before.  The other guys that were sitting by us left and were like wtf? When they went outside as well.  We'll never be back.  I'm really sad at how the service has gone from stellar to completely horrible in such a short period of time of this location being here.... :(",

I now think it's a manager problem and/or employee problem and my problem was an isolated case and will try this establishment again to see if I get different results. We have always been satisfied with the Sahara location over the years and I trust that this new location will be on par with Sahara in the near future. New locations always have a few problems to be worked out and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I've been assured that they always serve the freshest of foods and the owner's word is good enough for me as he seems like a man of integrity by what I could tell over the phone.",

I went there tonight and ordered half a chicken and a full rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides to go. When the girl charged me $39 I almost fainted, but  I hoped it would be worth the money. When I got home and opened the bags, my order was all messed up. Instead of a full rack of baby back ribs, they gave me 1/2 rack of dry St. louis ribs, the gave me an order of rice I did not order, and the chicken was completely dry, I mean, it was so dry we didn't even eat it. Last week I bought a chicken from Costco that was juicy and tender, unlike this overpriced dry stuff.  The only one winning is going to be my dog, who is the only one who will want to eat this chicken. I believe the girl taking my order didn't quite know how to take orders (after all it is a new location) and that's why I got charged so much. I will prob. Go tomorrow w my receipt (that is not itemized) to see if I was charged right.  Save your money and go to chipotle next door or buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store. The only plus is  that the location looked nice and clean.",

These ribs were literally the toughest chewy inedible piece of pork I have ever had. Disappointing to have to waste a full rack and have a hungry family.

The ordering process kind of drags along because while the line goes right in front of the line where food is prepped and sides are displayed/scooped, you have to wait until you get to the registers to place your order. Why not have it like Chipotle/Cafe Rio where you can order your food and watch it made as it moves along? I mean it's all right there in front of you...but I digress...  Anyways, back on track. Once you order and pay, you're given a number to place on your table and they'll deliver the food right to you similar to Smashburger and Jason's Deli. The chicken was juicy and the skin was flavorful and well seasoned. The mac & cheese was bleh and had no taste to it whatsoever! Was there even real cheese in there? Even a box of Kraft mac & cheese has more flavor WTF! The ribs were decent and had some good flavor and seasoning on it but you can tell they were just grilled and not smoked because they were hard to get off the bone and some parts were a little overcooked. Decent nonetheless, but at $21.99 per rack, wouldn't be worth it without some sort of discount.  The staff were all very nice although some of the cashiers seemed confused during the ordering process and their attention was not always focused on the transaction. The whole store seemed very hectic but that's typically the nature of a new business and hopefully with some experience, everything will run much more smoothly in the future!",

I walked in and saw all the employees even the owner Nico and Ladan taking orders to the tables making the fresh slaw! Ordering is easy, fast and friendly. I ordered their half ribs and chicken breast with chicken wings and their roasted potatoes very reasonably priced. The food was brought to me on real dinnet plates beautiful presentation of the food. Then taking a bite Pure Heaven! I highly recommend this restaurant the flavors are amazing the service is impeccable and the prices are Beyond reasonable.",

Seating is comfortable and a tip for newcomers is to take advantage of the outside seating located out the back of the restaurant. Very comfortable seating as well.   Now the not so good... service is on the slower side and the different cashiers I've encountered are struggling with the computer. This of course can be remedied by better training and when that happens Nevada chicken cafe will be a solid 4 star location.",

    "text": "This location is located right next to Chipotle in the busy Arroyo shopping plaza. I visited this establishment on opening day since a group of my co-workers were excited to give it a try. I have never visited the Sahara location and this was my first time trying it out. There was obvious 1st day hiccups. For example: cashiers stressed out and forgetting items ( they were trying their best so I can't knock em' for that) and missing items from orders at my table (most were corrected).   I ordered the 1/4 Chicken w/ two sides- watermelon and sweet potatoes. The chicken was the star of the plate. It was pretty good and grilled just right. The watermelon was fresh and sweet. However, the sweet potato was so-so.  I also sampled my co-workers Mac & Cheese and it was super bland w/ watery cheese (really bad).   Pros-  I like that they use Organic Chicken    I like they have fresh ingredients for sides (like my watermelon)  Fast and relatively healthy options ( you order/pay at counter and sit and wait for food)  Cons- sides were a hit or miss.... Sweet Potatoes were - Meh Mac & Cheese- Gross  Overall, I like the concept and my chicken. Perhaps this site will improve with time and hammer our some opening hiccups.  Also, my co-workers all seemed to enjoy their meals. Thus, I give them a solid 3 stars. I would come back and order the chicken and just be picky about what sides I would order.",

Would not get the ribs again . The chicken was ok . It seems as f they want you to drown it in the BBQ sauces . The sides are good , the Mac and cheese was not over cheesy but very good . The vegetable soup was the best part of the meal .   Overall - for quick BBQ it may hit the spot . Other sit down BBQ spots are better.",

They literally sell chicken , ribs and salad and healthy juices like it's literally half unhealthy and half healthy it just depends on the person lol like I walked in here and the smell of chicken and ribs omg got me sooooo hungry but I'm trying to keep a healthy regimen so I got the veggie soup and the avocado salad with the kale and Berry smoothie . The girl working the front seemed like a newbie she didn't even know they had veggie soup on their menu O.o anyways , they give LARGE portions of their food and soup and my salad even came with a side of sauteed veggies but you can choose different sides if you wanted . And the smoothie tasted pretty healthy I don't think they even put milk or yogurt in it which is a good thing . But yeah this place is pretty delicious and their portions are very generous , I definitely would recommend , next time you wanna get chipotle .. Go here instead hahaha",

I especially like their side dishes (not to detract from the chicken and ribs, stars of the show!). Generally in places like this, sides are greasy, fried, or both. Nevada Chicken offers sweet potatoes, fresh fruit, and other healthy options. Entrees automatically come with a yummy green salad, with sprouts, and light vinaigrette dressing. Not your usual barbecue fare.  A co-worker always gets their wraps, and says they're good. But I like their chicken too much to venture far afield.  Wish they also had lighter desserts. Only choices now are cheesecake and chocolate cake. And wish ice tea were a beverage option.  These are small quibbles. Recommend!  PS, yes I stop by often!",

The menu is fantastic!  I love the ribs and rotisserie chicken.  It takes some time to order because the choice of sides is so large and every one is great.

    "text": "This place has the absolute WORST service in any restaurant in all of the Las Vegas valley!  We had this delivered to our offices and it was pretty decent.  Ribs are super meaty, like twice the amount of meat than their local competitors.  Chicken and sides and wraps were just ok.  I figured I'd go the the restaurant and see what the food is like when it's fresh.  HUGE mistake!  The line was long due to a clearly incompetent cashier who had no business operating an electronic device.  The register was way too much technology for her and had to punch in everyone's orders at least twice.  We order and go find a seat.  There were lots of open seats, but they weren't cleaned off from the previous customers.  Nearly the entire dining room had not been bussed.  We and other customers had to ask repeatedly to have someone come and bus the tables because there was no clean tables to sit on.  The cashier begrudgingly went back and asked someone to clean off the table and gave an attitude that transled to: \"Why are you even bothering me? That's not even my job.\".The tables finally were bussed and we got seated.   25 minutes went by and my kids are antsy at this point.  We're all hungry and want to eat already.  Other customers looked agitated too.  35 minutes go by and some guy I'm assuming is the manager is going from table to table talking to the customers that are still waiting on their orders and I can see some of them getting visibly upset.  The guy gets to us and asks if it's okay if we wait another 20 minutes. WHAT THE F? He said they ran out of ribs.  How do you run out of ribs at a rib joint?  THAT'S ALL YOU DO! Why didn't the cashier say something before I ordered?  F this, I'm not waiting an hour to eat. I go to the register to demand a refund and find a long line of customers also wanting a refund.  Remember the incompetent cashier from earlier?  I think her brain exploded from trying to figure out how to do a refund on a card transaction because she simply gave up and started refunding credit card transactions in cash to the nearest dollar instead.  I'm pretty sure she got fired for being short on her register count at the end of the night.    Well that just about nails it. I'm not ever going to this place again, and I suggest Yelpers not go there either.  Get it delivered if you're jonesing for mediocre BBQ, but don't ever set foot in the place.",

For give for sounding so harsh and rude but basically what I'm saying its kind of a waste of money. There's really nothing new here. But if you're hungry, and don't care spending about $9.95 for something you can make at home, buy all means who's stopping you .",

    "text": "We came here the week it first opened. What a waste of money... For two of us for lunch, we spent around $30, absolutely not worth it.   First of all they didn't have anything we wanted. My husband wanted the pulled pork and they ran out. What would have helped is if they put a sign or blocked out what they didn't have. Or at least mention it before we ordered. No one said anything to us. Actually yes, no one said anything to us till they felt ready to serve us. We stood at the register for a while, the girl running it looked like she was having a really hard day. Felt bad for her. :(  After ordering our food, went to sit, noticed entire place was a mess. There were used dishes on a lot of tables, and the floor was dirty. We wiped down a table to eat at.  They brought us our meal and it wasn't anything we ordered. I ordered a ribs combo and he ordered a chicken combo. We both got two ribs and chicken served to us. In the most unflattering manner. We tried to get it fixed, one guy told me that is how it's served, told me that was what I ordered. Absolutely not, since my husband didn't want any ribs to begin with. I went over to someone else and had it sorted out. They said they would fix the check and do a discount of some sort. We waiting around for 15 minutes for that to happen, nothing, so we just left. As I was leaving I noticed some people had garnish and whatever on their plates. I didn't have any of that. Neither did the guy sitting behind me...   Chicken was dry... Ribs were dry... Too salty, like someone had a bag of salt and served protein with it. Gravy on the potatoes tasted like it came from a fast food joint.",

When I crave for fresh grilled chicken, this is where I want to be! Their chicken cooked over mesquite charcoal is truly an amazing  treat! The spices used on their chicken blends in well with the added flavor from the smokey mesquite charcoal. This surely takes it to the next level!  My usual order is their 3 piece dark meat - with additional charge of sides, rice and mixed vegetables. I always request for BBQ and Ranch sauces to dip my chicken in.The chicken is always tender and moist. The red rice is seasoned well. Prices are decent and the service for me is always great.   I like the simplicity of their menu items: 2 meat options  Hot and Cold sides Salads and Wraps 2 types of Sandwiches  Wings, Soup, Desserts Family Meals, Combos",

I do agree with other reviews that the chicken size could be bigger but its no different from the size you get at el pollo loco. I was full walking out. If I ordered the 1/4 chicken I would probably have still been hungry.   I would eat here again.",

I went in to finally try it and the girls chatting amongst each other not even paying attention to anything else. We were the only ones there for a bit but still. I ordered the chicken and ribs combo which came with one side I ordered to other sides and wings next thing I know the girl was preparing 4 sides and when I confronted she goes you wanted 4 sides no I never asked for that when she was reading back the order it was never mentioned 4 sides only 3! I work in customer service and it wasn't handled the best needless to say. At the end of her continuing to say I ordered 4 sides. Finally after awhile asks if I want a refund I couldn't believe it... at that point I didn't want it I chose to keep the extra side. Then back to chatting it up about \"birthdays and not wanting to get any older.\" I spent $30 there! The food tasted good it was the only thing me and my boyfriend ate all day. Both of us about an hour later started having horrible stomach pains like we literally were in pain and it wouldn't stop. We went the bathroom so many times that day. I did end up taking the food home. I feel stupid for eating the leftovers knowing what happened but I gave it another shot and here I am in the same boat as I was and NO ONE SHOULD FEEL SICK OR HAVE BAD STOMACH PAINS AND GOING THE BATHROOM AFTER EATING ANY FOOD. That is not health code at all the health department needs to check this out ASAP!",

We went in as we often do and got the whole chicken with 2 sides which is under the family meal on their display tvs. The lady said \"it's not a family meal\". No further discussion that it's under where it says family meal.. whatever okay no big deal it doesn't give me 3.00 off on sundays, but the way she said it was just really abrupt and rude.. I'm not sure how many more times I will come here if this is the level of service offered.  P.S. why is the menu (TV's) not viewable from where you order?  Update:  I returned after the owner reached out to me. It seems their customer service has improved and they were very friendly. Once again there was absolutely no problem with their food, it's incredibly good!",

The  prices are comparable to Church's, Pollo Loco etc. And the other reviews are accurate - Chicken is okay, white chicken is a little dry but that is what you can expect from white chicken. The ribs are what really slide this restaurant down the drain. The ribs are not good, fatty with no meat, and overcooked. They had an identity crisis and should have just focused on chicken. I was pretty disappointed overall. If you view this place more of a fast food joint, as opposed to a casual upscale, it will help with expectations and your experience will be more enjoyable. You can't trust ribs from a fast food joint.",

We got the baby back ribs since they are dry rub and not smothered in BBQ sauce like they normally are - which might be the source of some of the bad reviews.  Personally we love dry rub ribs much better, and since they gave us sauce on the sides, we didn't understand all the complaints about the ribs being under seasoned.  I actually preferred the ribs without the sauce and the seasoning was perfect to me, my gf dipped them in the sauce however.  Our only complaint is that the wait time is LONG, so prepare yourselves for that.  We'll be back!",

When I had gone in, it seemed a bit chaotic and the people working there were obviously trying to get a handle on things. The food wasn't bad then, and it's even better now! They are really turning things around now. They must be getting into the flow of things, because my food was even more amazing, as it should be, not dry at all like some other reviews depict it to be(although things change between one cook to another I'm sure!). I'm giving it four stars instead of five, because they still need some work to get things top notch. I'm sure as time goes on they will improve and I will review it again then!",

Although the Chicken was cooked all the way through it Lacked Flavor. Just Salt and Pepper, and  No Mesquite or any other type of BBQ smoke I was expecting. Heck, the BBQ I cooked last night with plain ole Kingsford briquettes gave More Flavor than this place.  Ribs were Tough, not anywhere close to Fall Off the Bone, lacked Flavor too.  BBQ sauce, I don't know where they hid it, I saw the bottles of Hot Sauce, Not Labeled by the way, a weird watery Salsa, the Ranch Dressing, and Whatever diced up salad, but No BBQ sauce.  Mac&Cheese, I think someone Forgot to Add the Cheese, it was just Mac&Some Creamy salted substance.  After hearing about the Sahara location, I was excited about the New Location in my neck of the woods, but after spending almost $13, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. Maybe I'll try the Sahara location, who knows.  2 Stars for the Cleanliness and Nice staff, but for a Restaurant, the Food Needs to be Flavorful and Needs to Taste good!",

So I mixed in some BBQ sauce and it was much better.  My friend got the pulled pork sandwich but it looked like a strange sub in a tightly wrapped paper.  It contained onions which was not disclosed to her when she ordered so she had to spend most or her time picking them out of the tight sub.  Overall, this place does not impress.",

That being said, I should know what a good tasting chicken taste like.  I should know what a cooked chicken taste like.  When Nevada Chicken Cafe opened, I immediately bookmarked it because of their selection and prices.  I was here about a week after they opened and was treated with great service, a clean restaurant, and again, good prices.  For about $10, I got their half roasted chicken with a side of their sweet potatoes.  First of all, their sweet potatoes are phenomenal.  I would come back just for this.  Then there was the chicken. Again, I got the half chicken which consists of a breast, wing, leg, and a thigh.  The leg and thigh was good and full of flavor. I was almost an instant huge fan of the Nevada Chicken Cafe and let me stress...ALMOST.  It was all downhill once I got to their breast and wing.  Both looked cooked on the outside, but raw on the inside.  I understand, maybe it's an adjustment period for them. But since they specialize in chicken, they should at least get the cooking right.  I ate the pieces that were edible (i.e. not red or bloody).  I didn't complain or bring my dish back.  I figure that they'll improve and I hope they do.  Their chicken dropped my rating. Overall, I am just giving them 3 stars for the service, their menu selection, the prices, and their sweet potatoes.   PS:  The ribs looked good.  They at least looked cooked.",

The green salsa and cucumber salad on the condiment bar both had good flavor.   There's patio seating out the back door and it was a lovely day to enjoy my lunch outdoors.   I was in the long  line at Chipotle when I thought I'd give this location a go. Glad I did. Good stuff!  Ate here again on 3/1/16.  Even better than the last time. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Succulent, smokey and crispy skin. The tortilla was very soft and delicious. Great salsa. The side of black beans had a unique flavor. Unique as in delicious. My wife thought a touch of vinegar was added. Whatever it was they were not your average black beans.  Nice job.  The place was full as it should be. Reasonable prices.

Served dry, and I don't think they spent much time in the slow cooker. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard fare, and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring.  The mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate.   It was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco.   For the plate and a Bud Light, I spent $20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread. With the handful of other BBQ places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down-home skills, these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up.",

The setup inside is very similar to the Chipotle next door. Tortilla maker up front and all the food prepared before your very eyes.   I ordered the chicken and ribs combo. After you order you go over to the drink station where you are greeted by tons of BBQ sauces and what nots. The cucumber salsa thing is really good.  The chicken was moist and tender, as were the ribs. Not fall off the bone, which is what prevented this from being a 5 star joint. I prefer fall off the bone.  Bathrooms are clean and safe to use.

Loved all but the yams (too sweet for me but still good).      My husband had pulled pork and loved it. In fact, he wanted to go back the following week to have another.   I split it with him and it really was tasty.  Perfect meal with mac n cheese and fruit as sides.  Yum! Service was just ok however.  I didn't know that BBQ sauces were in the side bar until I read other reviews here, and person just left my food at the table without saying anything.  Cashier was a little short with us when we ordered on the first visit and we were unsure what to order.   Will definitely be back for the food!",

Lots of cool chicken options, and the place and food looked and tasted fresher than an El Pollo Loco. The special of the day was a 1/4 chicken and 4-rib combo that came with a side and a drink for $11.99. We got two with a chicken soup for less than $25 after our Yelp discount! The ribs were very tasty, the chicken tasted very moist (but not flavored much), and the ribs were the best part. Only bad thing was they ran out of ice while we were there, and it took about 20 min to get our order and ice. Otherwise a pretty good experience.",

I went today and ordered a full rack of ribs and macaroni and cheese.   The menu is pretty solid and clearly posted when you walk in. After I ordered my food I noticed that all the empty tables had trash on it. I had to ask them to clear off a table so I can have a place to sit. BTW the place wasn't crowded. maybe half the tables were occupied. They give you a flag with a number so they now where to bring your food. Once the ribs were dropped off. Yes dropped off, because the person didn't say a word after dropping the food off. I had to ask where the BBQ sauce were. I felt like someone should have told me that the sauces were near the soda machine. I also had to wipe down the bottle because it was sauce of over them. The ribs were good, but the mac and cheese seemed to be watery. This might be my 3rd time there and the food seems really franchise-like.   Pros - Location, Ribs,   Cons - Not the cleanest place, customer service, variety of sauces.  sides are mediocre.",

I ordered the combo with 1/4 rack (3 bones) of baby back ribs, chicken leg/thigh, side of mac & cheese, and fountain drink. At $11.99, that seemed like a good deal. I got my number, sat down, and the food came out pretty quickly. I liked that it came with a small side salad and tortilla. Those were welcome surprises. The ribs were tender, but not fall off the bone tender. I liked the seasoning, though one bone was over seasoned and salty. The chicken was juicy for the most part, but some bites were bordering on slightly overcooked. For a place called Nevada Chicken Cafe, you'd think every bite would be mouth watering juicy, but it wasn't. The mac & cheese was average and the pasta was cooked past al dente. I prefer al dente, but it wasn't mushy, so I was fine with it.  At the end of the meal, I was fairly full. I thought the ribs were a bit small, but for the price, the portion size was good and my stomach was satisfied. I don't love this place, but I like it enough to return again.",

The ribs are great as well, hence the combo is a must try.  Plenty of hot and cold sides to chose from that complement the chicken and ribs well.  My usual side is the corn on the cob but I recommend the mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, fruit salad, regular salad, pasta salad as well.  The two locations are very convenient and service is always fast when ordering and getting the food.  Definitely try the regular and blueberry BBQ sauces on your chicken and/or ribs.  The blueberry sauce has more of a tang and I enjoy switching between the regular and the blueberry.  Also try the garlic spread and the salsa with the chicken, great combination with the supplied flour tortilla.  Enjoy Nevada Chicken Cafe!",

    "text": "Nevada chicken cafe ... you changed.   As previously I mentioned I strictly only come here for the ribs because they don't disappoint ... but oh noooo ... they disappointed me.  First I must mention the flavor is the same ... so kudos for not changing your flavor.    1.  Numbers don't lie  The fiance and I always order a full rack of ribs to share.  Instead of it just stating \"full rack\" they recently updated the menu and it states a full rack is 12 ribs.  When we were close to being done, we realized we only got 11/12 ribs.   We didn't say anything because we didn't want to be the D-bag person to go back and ask just for 1 rib.   However l, if you're gonna change your menu and add a specific number, I think it's important that the cook or whoever plates the food counts to 12.  Double count if you need to.  I wouldn't have cared or noticed how many ribs you get for a full rack, but just because you added a number ... I noticed and now I care.      2.  You got skinny  I know it's 2016, the start of the new year, people got goals to stay skinny ... but did the ribs have to suffer ??? My fiance and I are always stuffed, maybe overstuffed even after throwing down a full rack of ribs, but when we were finished we were questioning if we should've ordered more.    There's hardly any meat on the ribs now.   You can view the pics to see the difference from what I got and previous photos of ribs.     I still got high hopes for you Nevada Chicken Cafe ... I hope tonight was just a rough night and things will get better in the morning.       To be continued ...",

    "text": "When you hear of charcoal grilled chicken, you know it gotta be good, right? Damn, it gotta be better than the gas grilled El Pollo Loco, according to the cashier. Well, answer will depend on who is doing the cooking. In this case, NCC has failed badly.  I went and visited their southwest location (located on S Rainbows) a week after their grand opening hoping for some delicious chicken. I was so disappointed afterward and here is why:  The chicken is soooooooooooooo dried and way under season. Basically they seasoned just the outside of the chicken, so the only place you can taste some flavor is on the chicken skin. The meat was so dried and bland, it felt like chewing glue instead of chicken.   By the way, for a place that just opened, the restrooms were so nasty and smelly. Good thing I ate before I went there to wash my hands, otherwise the appetite would be ruined. Ewwwwwwwwww.  As for the cashier, the answer is: El Pollo Loco chicken does taste better :-)",

The sides (10 choices hot & cold) are fresh and taste homemade with something for everyone. Recommend the rib/ chicken combo, mash potatoes and side salads. Mother in law swears by the pulled chicken sandwiches. Had them cater for a work event and it was a huge hit!  When you leave not only will you feel full, and happy about the cost but you can eat super clean & healthy. Menu perfect for low carb, pales and those that are vegan. We travel across town 2-3 times a month to visit.",

Friendly service with 5 stars for plate presentation. Came with one side, drink and house salad.  Salad and side were great. Ribs and chicken looked great and the seasoning on the ribs and chicken is the only reason I may give this place a second chance.  The ribs and the chicken (breast & wing) were overcooked which equals dry.  I has hoping by coming early I would not experience overcooked food because it was sitting to long.  Again great taste due to the seasoning but someone needs some coaching in the kitchen on how to use a meat thermometer.   Will update my review when I give them a second chance.",

The place was messy, the employees looked disorganized so service was BAD. Their concept reminds me of California Chicken Cafe in LA but they come no where close. $30 down the drain on a horrible meal.

He finally finished his business and took the orders.  He missed one of my order. No big deal. Now to the food, the chicken was very, very dry it took me a while to chew and swallow. The ribs were ok but not very tender. Btw while I was waiting for the guy to finish his cash counting, I have noticed the kitchen people only wore one glow while putting food into the display window. One guy had such a dirty fingernail it made me think, I cant believe he works in the kitchen with those dirty hands/nails, preparing food with only wearing one glove on one hand, what about the other hand with those dirty nails touching the food??  Maybe the manager needs to check the cleanliness of his employees. Specially the hands and fingernails or make them wear gloves on both hands while handling food.",

    "text": "Recently we decided to try this place. With high hopes we walked in and loved the smell. The menu is easy to navigate. I walked up to order my family meal and waited while the order taker talked to the kitchen staff for about two minutes. Then she took my order and was fairly rude while doing it. I asked a few questions as it was my first time. She was very snippy and not very clear. She asked if I wanted baby back ribs or  St. Louis ribs? I said we'll let me ask my family she said 'oh we'll you'll get the St. Louis because we ain't got anything else.' I was finished ordering and was highly disappointed in my first experience at this restaurant.   Our food came and the lady set it down and walked away with a huff and puff. Very strange no ok here is your food or do you need anything else or enjoy your meal. Just a huff and puff. We started eating and realized they gave us half of our tortillas and only one side. I went to correct this and get our food (thinking it was just a misunderstanding). The lady (same one from ordering)said oh we brought you all of your food. Then she checked with the kitchen people and realized she was wrong and got me my food without apologizing. Oh and the claim that their tortillas are 'homemade' they aren't. You can go next door to walmart and buy the 'uncooked' tortillas in the refrigerated section. They are the same.   Finally we sat down to eat and it was delicious. The food was great! I would love to eat here fairly often. The sauce bar had two sauces and a bunch of empty spaces. The bathroom was clean. The eating area was clean. The music was horrendous. It was loud and was--what I imagine-- club music to be. There was some language that was not great for a family with small children.   I will be back but only for the food and probably after I forget about the terrible service! Maybe for take out.",

The sides are the exciting part of the experience but due to dieting I couldn't try the ones I really wanted(Mac and cheese, mashed with gravy..etc) so I decided on the cole slaw. It was very dry and bland. Tasted like there was no salt or any seasoning for that matter and barely any mayo or vinegar, couldn't tell what style it was. The chicken was just ok, nothing to run back to for. The ribs were the best part of the visit. A decent amount of meat and packed with flavor.

The food quality and service was great and the restaurant is very clean and inviting.  Today, the latter 2 were both True.  Nice cashier and still a clean and friendly place to visit.    The unfortunate part came with the meal.  Me and my lunchmate ordered 2 wraps.  Both came out looking very nicely presented.  When we took the paper off, the wraps both completely fell apart with ingredients and sauce all over the outside and falling out of the back.  It was actually embarrassing trying to eat them.  We ended up dissecting them on the plate and knife & forked them most of the remainder of the meal.  That's an issue that can be overlooked...maybe only a start loss for expectations being missed.  What killed the other stars for me was about 3/4 way through my 'open faced' chicken wrap, I got a mouthful of lovely crunchy chicken bones.  To add to my embarrassment of the sloppy mess I tried to manhandle, I got to spit an entire mouthful of chewed food into my napkin like a 4 year old.  At that point, both of our appetites were completely destroyed.    It only takes one bad experience to ruin a restaurant for me.  Especially when the establishment sharing a common wall with this one delivers quality and service that's expected every single time.  And they apparently have a much better manual entitled, \"How To Effectively Wrap Food in Tortillas\".    Sorry to rain on the parade...I had high hopes, but they've been thwarted.  :(",

When you first go inside you notice it's warm in there, which makes it uncomfortable.  Once you order, they deliver the food to you.  The person who delivered the food was pleasant, but she just put down the good in front of people without any clue who ordered what and quickly walked away.  After each delivery we had to go the food shuffle to correct the order.   The chicken was good, but it was warm at best.  My wife's ribs were tough and chewy.  She had a side of corn on the cob, which was also just warm.  When she asked for some butter, the employee said she would get some for her.  She came back with a side of tortillas?!?.  The salsa they had out also just tasted like plain tomato sauce, no seasoning at it.  It was gross.  I was so hoping the food would of been better, but I'll give it another try in the future.  Maybe it was the fact it just opened and the kinks need to be worked out.",

The ribs was delicious very tender and there was a bar of sauces to choose from, barbecue, salsa, and horseradish ranch very yummy. I ordered the CHICKEN AVOCADO wrap and it was awesome! I bet the chicken they make are always fresh, slowly grilled rotisserie style. The ingredients tasted fresh as well. ROTISSERIE CHICKEN at its finest.  Definitely coming back .",

    "text": "I ate here in early December with some friends, it was so good and tasty.   Fast forward to this evening. My wife wanted ribs and I excitedly suggested Nevada Chicken Cafe. We ordered ribs, chicken, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and coleslaw. We deliberately over ordered with the intent to bring most of it home. The ribs and chicken were so over cooked and tough, we barely ate a couple ribs of the 1 1/2 racks we had. The rest stayed on the plate uneaten.   The ribs we could eat had no flavor, just dry rib meat that took forever to chew.    The mac n cheese had the distinct appearance of old mac n cheese married to a fresh batch. Some of it was creamy and soft, most of it was a darker color and chunky. The coleslaw was ok.  The mashed potatoes were great. So I guess for just under $70 we split a small delicious bowl of mashed potatoes a gravy.  We took nothing home except regret.",

In looking at the menu I was impressed with both the selection and the prices. I assumed Nevada Chicken Cafe was rotisserie chicken and sides, but they offer much more. They offer BBQ ribs, salads, and wraps. The list of sides offered a nice variety of hot and cold options. There are meal options for larger orders too.  I went with a 1/4 Chicken that said it would come with a warm tortilla and salsa along with one side. I went with macaroni and cheese as my side. I was given the option of rotisserie, mesquite charcoal, or a mix for the chicken. I opted for the mix of the two. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was moist, had good flavor, and the skin was tasty. I really liked the BBQ sauce that came with the chicken. The tortilla was fine and went well with the chicken. My salsa was absent. The macaroni and cheese was bland. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again.  Overall, a decent meal option and reasonably priced for what you get. I'd give this place another try.",

My point, this chicken served here kinda reminded me of the food plates served at that dinner show. I wonder if they order from here. Skimpy wimpy warm salad and no need for the tortilla. But the mashed potatoes a must! Can get a whole rotisserie chicken for less elsewhere - price comparison reasons. However, chicken was good. Nicely seasoned.   Aromatic food smells from the outside. The kind that makes my hair smell like BBQ. Don't take my idea up on that; I doubt it's appealing as a shampoo scent. May I suggest though, do try their chicken and mashed potatoes!",

We had to order all those items a la carte. They do have plenty of combos for the ribs though. Overall a good menu, the booths could be a little more cleaner and the cashier person should be more enthusiastic and friendlier.",

Nevada Chicken Cafe is located near my office just off the 215 in the southwest part of town. It's in the Arroyo Crossing Center next to Chipotle. The food is a little pricey, but it's fresh and delicious!   They make their amazing chicken and ribs on site and it smells SO GOOD in there! You can choose mesquite or rotisserie chicken (rotisserie is my fav!) and they also have ribs, wings, and a few other main meal choices. Salads, wraps, soups...it's all great! My personal favorite is white meat chicken with macaroni and cheese and a side salad. The veggies for the salad are crisp and tasty! And as far as macaroni and cheese goes theirs is BOMB! It's so cheese-y and gooey! I just cannot pass it up!  Give it a try...your taste buds will thank you!",

The service is quite fast & I totally appreciate that, especially when I need a quick bite to eat during my lunch break. The flavor of their food is good, but I'm not completely in love with it.  Their serving size is enough, but when you're so used to being over fed at other restaurants, the portion size here may appear a bit small.   Nonetheless, I'd still come here every now & then.",

It also comes with a salad and vinaigrette that was tasty. The Caesar salad was pretty large for a side, but I'm not complaining... It was yummy! They use the big croutons, which I love, and a low calorie dressing. My fiance ordered the ribs and mesquite grilled chicken. He loved the ribs, and I particularly enjoyed their BBQ sauce because it's a little sweet. The smoky mesquite flavor definitely came through.

This location does not cook their chicken like the real place, they don't have the same sides and the silubsitiute sides they have suck.  I usually eat heir mashed potatoes and corn by the gallon but they don't even have the corn here.  It's this disgusting grilled corn on the cob nothing like the original.

It needed more kick and maybe some smokiness to offset the sugar content.   I had the the bbq chicken sandwich with the coleslaw. The chicken was good, moist and tender...the slaw was not so good. I do not like dry slaw and this was drrrrrryyyyyyy. Creamy is where it's at otherwise it's just cabbage.  Service was good though, you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.",

I was served by the owner Nico he was very nice and very articulate when it came to making sure that the way the items were served was artistically set in a certain way. I was starving I have no problem eating the entire meal down... they definitely have a different better product to offer than other chicken places did I mention they had ribs too? the ribs were awesome..

    "text": "So there was a lot of buzz about the Nevada chicken cafe at the office so a few of us stopped out for lunch. The place was very clean which scores a lot of points with me, however it was not enough to earn more than 2 stars from me.   I tried the 1/4 chicken with the 2 sides of  mashed potatoes and gravy and the feta and spinach pasta.   First and foremost, the chicken was dry and the portion was pretty weak. (maybe i just got a wimpy chicken) others that were eating the same thing looked much better and bigger than the one I got. The chicken is similar (but not as good as) the little rotisserie chickens you can buy at Von's or Smith's. The only two things that set it apart from said grocery store chicken, is that Nevada Chicken cafe's chicken is dryer and there is a little bit of a citrus taste on the skin.   The mashed potatoes were not to different from KFC's mashed potatoes. Not all that great....and finally the pasta, if there was feta cheese on that i would like to know where it was. I love feta cheese and could not notice it in the pasta at all. It was actually pretty bland which was very disappointing.  Other than the food, the place was clean, the staff seemed nice and we got our food quickly.    I may give the place one more try in the future just with lower expectations.",

The location is convenient, and the seating area is clean.  The staff seems friendly, they took care of our daughters missing drink and my husbands missing drink order too.   The food was okay. The ribs were tender & juicy, but our kids drumsticks and chicken wings were dry. They mixed up my mashed potatoes order but it's fine. (Cashier did not repeat our order so she probably got confused.)   Will probably come back again.",

The parking is limited, there's no visible handicap access, very limited seating, and the side dishes are just okay, nothing special.  The worst thing, though, is that they're nowhere near our house so we don't have quick & easy access.  Service is great, the staff is friendly, and luckily it's much cleaner inside than the exterior would leave you to expect.  Now we just need them to open up a location in the NW, maybe Centennial?",

Sides are made in house and there's weekly specials everyday so you can try different items. Last time I tired the smoked wings which were huge and very tender, not dry at all. Glad NV CC is holding it down for local spots.",

It already showed promising ratings and the family felt like BBQ or similar. The place was a bit quite and only 1 table had a party eating their meal. It was a late lunch so maybe this was just typical.  I had the half chicken with bbq beans & cooked sweet potatoes. Mostly everyone else had chicken or a chicken wrap. I was not disappointed as the chicken had good flavor and not dry. The beans were a bit sweet but still good and the sweet potatoes were in chunks and pretty good (not overdone with sugar).  I think everyone really like what they order and pleased.  I gave this 4 stars because the food was pleasing from my expectations. Maybe a half star too high, because the employee could be better trained to be inviting, make suggestions and overall more outgoing and professional. He got the job done though.",

It dawned on me, as I walked in the door that the smell is heaven and it's so yummy, what am i gonna order and whaaat?....First time checking in? NO WAY, I come here a lot and apparently am too distracted to remember to check in.  So for my \"first time\" I got $5 off yelp deal. Sweet! I went with the pulled pork sandwich, cold chicken salad and a DIET green tea to make myself feel better about gorging myself at lunch.  Cashier super nice paid, took my number, had a seat in front of TV with soccer on. Three minutes later food arrived. I'm not sure what happened after I took pic of my food but I looked down and it was magically gone. I suppose I should have slowed down but I never do.  Pulled pork sandwich perfectly sauced with the BBQ and slaw...soft roll made it extra delish. Cold chicken salad pretty good but sauce a little sweet for me.  Only disappointed they are limited on BBQ sauce choices but the garlic sauce is tasty I could put it on everything...  I will of course be back and try to get better about checking in!",

I was like, \"jackpot!\" My man took me here one day because I was craving corn on the cob.   The corn on the cob was so good! I love the flavor of the roasted chicken. They also have ribs if you like that. I really enjoy the chicken & their wraps. They have nice t.v.'s so you can watch sports while you're in there.   They serve beer as well but I'm not much of a drinker so I didn't bother to remember what kind they sell.  Whenever we eat there, someone is always asking how everything was & if we need anything. That's really nice that they care.   Now, the past times that I've gone in there, they remember me & my baby. Maybe because we're starting to become regulars. I just have to say that they are really nice & friendly at Nevada Chicken Cafe. Makes you feel welcome to come back.  I was reading their to go menu & I noticed that it said that they delivered too. That's good to know for me being a busy mom & all. Of course I'm definitely coming back.",

So, I got a hankering for BBQ chicken the other day, and decided to see what they were all about.   I walked into a clean, welcoming restaurant. They had a pretty extensive menu. The nice thing is everything seemed so healthy. I ended up getting the \"Waldorf Chicken Salad.\" This salad was huge. Everything was so fresh. It had grapes, celery, peppers, tomoatoes, walnuts, etc., everything a good salad should have.   I also ended up getting three pieces of dark meat to save for dinner, the mesquite flavored. The chicken was delicious. It was moist and tender.  I really don't have any complaints. I thought the service was fine. I was in and out around 5 minutes. Overall, great place to eat and not too pricey for what you're getting.",

Received a call about 10 minutes before the ETA I was given at checkout and I was told it would take a bit longer to receive our order. No problem, it's a lot of food and there are a lot of people that eat there. What is a problem is to then neglect bringing any drinks for any of our orders and not responding to my inquiries to at least receive a refund for the items we did not receive. The food was pretty good but I can't justify ordering from somewhere that not only doesn't deliver 100% of your order but then on top of that doesn't do the right thing. Maybe limit your visits with this establishment to dine-in only.",

They were good. BBQ sauce made it better. It wasn't the best ribs I've ever had in my life, but I'd get them if I were in the mood and couldn't find anywhere else to get them.   Chicken- 2 star.  It wasn't juicy, flavorful, and the best part was the skin. I was hoping that the flavor would have infused inside the chicken, but it was a meh.   Make sure to check-in before  you pay, so that you can get $5 off your bill. I couldn't get my discount since it was AFTER I had already paid.  I'd come back and try a few other things. Staff were friendly and super nice. Kudos for that!",

And to be honest with you they would've gotten four stars in my opinion if there food service was better.   The smell coming from this restaurant is phenomenal. The dining room is extremely clean and the atmosphere is very welcoming. They have a great menu and they have a lot of options for many different types of people.   The food was fresh and organic and tasted amazing! I had a half roasted chicken with baked beans and a side salad. (I eat low carb)! It was delicious! My fitness ordered ribs which smelled amazing,however one of my friends and I received our food right away and the other (who ordered first) didn't get her food for 10 more minutes. The distributing part was people who ordered after her received there meals. But when they did finally bring out her food she was pleased.   I'll go back again and I'll bring people to try it! I just suggest that management steps up on the service quality.",

A coworker had suggested that we get a salad from there, we ordered to go, and when we got back to the office there was no chicken on my salad! I ordered chicken on my chicken salad! WTF!  I ordered catering from their site, entered my credit card information and in less than 24 hours I got 3 fraud alert warnings and had to cancel my credit card.  I told the delivery driver and he assured me that it wasn't them, So I asked about his PCi security standards, and he had nothing to say as he is walking around with my credit card number on his order paper.   So I decided to go through a third party caterer.   I placed a catering order for one of the teams at my job, and had to cancel the order because the employees could not make it into the office due to the entire team getting in a car accident the night before. I had the third party caters call to cancel the order and they said the manager was rude and was not willing to budge on the \"cancellation fee\"  The cancellation fee was 50%. For that price why didn't you just bring the food. They said they already made the food. A garden salad, pasta salad, and assorted wraps that you sell....   The manager was very rude and did not care about the circumstances.    I should have known not to go back..... After these four instances.  I will NEVER..... EVER EVER EVER EVER go back to Nevada Chicken Cafe.",

My side were potatoe salad and chicken pasta salad, which I didn't like so ask them to switch to side salad.  It's just like eating at El Pollo Loco(my fav. Grill chicken place).. Have to admit this place is really clean and you don't have clean up after you finish.. I didn't see any trash can, assuming they do that.. Just like panera bread..

    "text": "I've been here twice now and I like the convenience of it being so close to my work. But to be truthful; call your order in for any to-go's as wait times are longer than I had expected my first time. My call in order was awesome!! Ready right when I walked in and all the accoutrement to boot. Good food, friendly staff but for less money I might also consider El pollo loco the other direction. A tip for owners/management would be to maybe add a coupon deal like $5.00 off a $15.00 deal as I noticed a lot of individual diners or maybe discount for nearby employees of neighboring retailers i.e.; Home Depot.",

I mean if youre a slightly new restaurant, you should try to get as much good feedback as you can on customer service,yeah? Anyways, once I was in the restaurant , the lady cleaning the tables was just staring at me.. Like okay what are you staring at? I ordered my food & I asked the girl at the cashier how long it would take,she said 5 minutes&  I was like cool , I have enough time to enjoy my food on my break instead of rushing to eat.. So she gave me my number& I sat down. 5 minutes..10 minutes.. 15 minutes passed & still nothing. Even during that time the lady that was cleaning came around & gave me a deep stare again?! Like geez..I noticed the lady even packing the food kept talking to the other employees.. She finally gave me my food & she didnt even say thank you come again she kinda just slammed my order my table & took my number.  But once I ate the 6 piece bbq chicken wings.. It was SO GOOD. The bbq sauce was amazing!   i wouldve gave 5 stars but customer service needs to be better&the extended time wait should actually be near of what it actually is..",

The attitude the employee gave me wasn't nice.  The ribs were a little chewy and dry for my taste but the dry rub was tasty.  There were very few parking places. But that isn't their fault.  I was surprised to see that the one employee who had a bad attitude parked his black fiat right out front in the ONLY AVAILABLE  space and that was annoying.  The parking spots near the front should be for guests and not employees.  The other employees were very nice.  I'm not sure if I will go back.",

First of all the manager or whoever he was wearing street clothes filling salads and sides with his bare hands after handling money and his personal cell phone was a huge turn off.. Secondly both time I went I ordered a wrap. They say they're handmade tortilla which is a bullsh%&, each time the wrap fell apart when I opened it and each time the wrap had small bones still in the chicken....... REALLY? You can't even train your staff to take bones out of chicken? Poorly managed!! The California chicken cafe is what turned me into this spot, it's amazing in California. Actually real slow cooked rotisserie chicken, not 1 hour fast food style rotisserie. Might as well be a cheap el pollo loco, el pollo loco has them beat by a large margin!!!",

    "text": "It's chicken... The service is mediocre, the staff is not friendly and frankly its similar to el poyo loco (sp). I had a chicken avocado wrap (probably my first clue) that should be named the avocado chicken wrap with a fruit salad. I am attempting healthy. The fruit, while fresh was must have been cut from the same knife as the chicken because it tasted the same. Unfortunately the wrap was loaded with everything but an ample amount of chicken, which was bland. I will say that Ordering their grilled chicken is better.  But the lack of friendly service and a congested location will keep me away for a while.",

After paying the cashier came up to me and told me there was going to be a 20-25 minute wait on my wings. After agreeing because I was looking forward to this for lunch. Note that I made my order at 2:36pm and didn't receive my order till 3:24pm. They then told me they threw in a couple \"extra sides\" for me waiting. Thanks for that but two cups of free beans doesn't do for the almost hour of me waiting for 24 chicken wings, three mac and cheese and beans. I watched as everyone around me came in, ordered and received their orders within 10 minutes of being in there. I will not being going to this location anymore.",

The chicken sandwich was awful, tasted nothing like chicken. The macaroni and cheese tasted like it from a package. The service was terrible.

Got a 30% coupon in the mail and felt like some chicken so thought I'd give it a shot.  Called in an order but was put on hold for a looooong time during off peak hours.. Maybe about 3 pm.  So thought that was odd that they seemed busy.  Girl on the phone just took the order... My meal came with sides and a couple choices of how the food would be prepared.  But she didn't ask or give options so luckily I had menu in front of my face so I could order correctly and make sure I got everything I was supposed to.  So not an impressive start.  Picked up food and they were not busy so again... Not sure why I was on hold so long.  But really enjoyed the food and pleasantly surprised on how well everything was cooked and the flavors of everything were outstanding.  I'd actually give 4 or maybe even 5 stars if service wasn't lacking.  Also, price seems a bit on the high side without the coupon, but was pleasantly surprised in the end.  Give it a shot!   We had chicken and ribs with mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and a Caesar Salad.   All terrific!",

Waited 30 minutes for the food only to be told that it would be another 7 minutes which turned into 10 minutes only for someone to come out and say they were running out of baked beans.  The sides looks old and they don't seem to refresh them at the steam table. Everyone that came in after me got their food and left as I continued to wait and wait and wait.  When they finally brought out my order I had miniature ribs with no bbq sauce whatsoever!  Really??? I demanded a refund and the manager seemed to have a bad attitude rather than apologize for the delay.  Seriously??? Bad customer service! They will never get a dime of my money! Once everyone else receives this type of customer service they won't be back either.  Go to Dickeys BBQ instead. Dickeys has good customer service.  Don't know why I tried this place anyway. We should just stick to what we already know to be good. Lesson learned! Will not recommend this place to anyone!!!!",
