    "text": "Public School 702 is the kind of place for people who like the idea of unique food and drink, but don't really like good food and drink. It feels like a sad rip off of the farm-to-table places serving up memorable meals in Portland, Denver and beyond.  On the plus, I really liked the atmosphere.  Cool upstairs location. Neat notebook style menu and napkins themed like post it notes. Very cool.  The beer list is good. But beware that they don't actually have a lot of the stuff. My first two beer choices were met with a \"sorry, we're out of that.\" This includes Sierra Nevada Killerweis. Not exactly impossible to keep in stock.  The server - who was very kind - forgot to put in the order of the grilled Cauliflower appetizer. Too bad because most of the reviews on her, as well as my companion, raved about the dish.  We ordered a couple of different things. An uninspired steak salad and \"short ribs.\" Perhaps my understanding of short ribs is off. But what we got was a crockpot-style roast on a bed of flavorless mashed potatoes.   So be it. Probably a good place of a happy hour drink or 3. But must say the missing beers, never appearing appetizers and lackluster main course put this place in the loss column for me.",

Did not write down our order (which is fine if you are a good server, but not okay if you can't remember the order.) She took another 10 minutes to actually input our order into the POS. I know this since our table was next to the POS and she had to confirm with me how I wanted my burger as she entered it in to the system. The delayed effort resulted in her forgetting all about ordering our appetizer.   I have worked in a restaurant before and understand when it gets busy, and when mistakes happen etc .. but then Jessica had the audacity to lie about forgetting the appetizer and instead blamed the person who ran the food taking the app to the wrong table, then later blamed the kitchen for the problem. Said the \"kitchen\" was having a bad day. More like SHE was having a bad day. It would have been much better to just admit to making the mistake, then apologize and comp the appetizer.    The two stars are because of the manager who came by to check on us and apologize for the error. She seemed genuinely apologetic and kind.   Jessica meanwhile, dropped off our check, and then disappeared. We asked her for a box to take the leftovers home, but she never came back. Had to flag down another person for the box! Guess Jessica figured she wasn't getting a tip so we no longer mattered to her! Customer service at it's best at Public School 702!",

The place is decorated like a school with books and the solar system.  Very cute concept.  Seems like it would be a fun place at night hanging out in the bar.  We started with diet cokes.  They brought us very small bottles.  Not sure if this means you have to pay for refills.  I had the Colorado Lamb Burger with tomato cranberry jam, arugula, brie, brioche bun (I held the bun and had it wrapped in lettuce instead).  The burger was nice cooked.  Looked the brie, cranberry jam and arugula.  Yum!  Mom had the fish and chips.  She asked for cocktail sauce which they don't normally serve but they made it for her.  Fish was crispy on the outside, flaky instead.  Good flavor.  Mom loved the fries.   We had good service with a friendly waitress. Definitely a cut place.  I am sure we will be back at some point.",

Some drinks specials, but never, of course, their best beer offerings. I paid $11 for a pint! While a good, unique beer, $11 was too too much. And it took over 10 mins for me to be approached by the bartender (though, to her credit, she seemed really busy). And it nearly as much time to get my check. Not cool. (But again, the bar was under-staffed.) The space itself it nice. The beer offerings are good. There are plenty of TVs to watch the game. There's a nice outdoor area. The food looked tasty. But the staff are...underwhelming and unattentive. No one greeted me upon entry or exit. I can't say I've ever had that happen before. But the sour apricot beer was excellent.

    "text": "Public School 702 has the type of refined brand you'd expect from a chain restaurant, which it is, but manages to feel more like a small-scale, chef-driven spot thanks to a modern menu and great craft brews. As a gastropub, you'll find pub and bar fare that will hit the spot like bangers and mash consisting of snappy chicken and herb sausages and a hearty bacon brussels mash. Other top dishes include chicken wings with a crackly, crispy exterior; the adobo tacos that come with two roasted chicken and two short rib tacos; and the massive farro and brussels salad with pan seared scallops.  They serve brunch on weekends, too. Their French toast varies, but the blackberry lemon curd version I tried was equally sweet and tart. Even better was the fried jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles. Well seasoned with a thin, crispy crust, the chicken sat atop mildly spiced, savory waffles covered in a gravy full of bacon bits. Topped with a fried egg, the brunch version differs from the one on their regular menu which has more chicken and no egg.  Unfortunately, some dishes fall flat. I wasn't a fan of the broccoli or salt and vinegar chips in the mac and cheese. And, the grits in the shrimp and white cheddar grits dish was too soupy and runny for my liking.  Their beer list changes frequently, but they've had some great ones on the menu like Jommegang by Ommegang (a Belgian style dark ale) and Parabloa by Firestone Walker (a Russian imperial stout).  Service has been solid the few times I've gone, but the restaurant is so large, with a long rectangular layout, that you can see servers struggling to race to the bar to pick up drinks, race to the kitchen on the other end to grab food, and race back to the tables. I think all the servers act as food runners and bussers too so the amount of work they have to do isn't conducive to great customer service. It's an issue with management and the layout more than anything, but often reflects poorly on the servers.",

One person even got up and went to the bar to order drinks and grab us plates. We desperately needed waters filled, had no serving plates, no condiments and no server in sight. It was pretty disappointing and unfortunate for a group work lunch.   The buffalo cauliflower tots were delicious and a healthy portion. Crunchy breaded outside, and firm texture inside. The buffalo and blue cheese sauce served with them were also good.  The bacon cheese tots were ok. The potatoes tasted a little raw to me and had a snap not usually found in a tot.   The watermelon heirloom tomato salad was great. Charred watermelon, huge slices of tomatoes and a balsamic reduction.  The other people in my party also complimented the food but said they would not return because of the poor service. Sorry Public I guess school is out for more than the summer.",

We sat down at 6:30 so HH was almost over. It wasn't very busy at all. We were ready to order basically right when we sat down. Our waitress introduced herself as Courtney. She came off very sweet, but wasn't great. We ordered the truffle fries, calamari, Margherita pizza, and the tuna poke. The calamari came out really quick. Less than 5 minutes after we ordered and it was out. It was great! The aioli and the calamari itself was amazing. With this as our starting dish, we expected the rest of the food to be great. More than 10 minutes later our truffle fries came out. They were HORRIBLE. I loveeeee anything truffle. Truffle oil, white/black truffle, truffle aioli, basically anything truffle. They had no flavor, the lemon aioli was horrible, and to top it off, they were not even remotely hot. Our waitress didn't stop back by to check on us for a while so we weren't able to let her know. The pizza followed a couple minutes later and was good. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. Finally, once we were done with the calamari and pizza, the poke came out. Very surprised it took over 25 minutes to receive. It looked like it was pre made like all the cooks would have to do would be scoop it, put it in a bowl, and grab some chips to put on the plate. It wasn't bad, the passion fruit in it gave it an odd, but unique flavor.   Overall it was a very disappointing experience. We had higher expectations of the food and service. I get it. If it's busy, I know you will not be at my table all the time, but would've been nice if she did a quality check once we had our food. It was not busy at all. Especially for HH business. We were ready to go before we even had our poke. We assumed she forgot to ring it in since it took so long. We took two bites of the poke and asked for the check so we could leave.   Did not see a manager present in the venue, but the hostess in the blue dress with boots was very sweet and sold us on the restaurant.   With so many options in DT Summerlin, we might stop by to grab a cocktail at the bar, but will not be dining in.",

Initially when we came around 5pm, it was a little quiet but as the night went on it really picked up.  When we first walked in, we weren't greeted but no big deal. We quickly found our own seats. Our server Jared was amazing and the cocktails were so good. The sliders were perfect as well as the adobo tacos. We plan on coming back here very soon! Very nice happy hour selection.",

And that is just what Public School 702 did.  They did a great job of managing our table, our requests, and our one food complaint (my friend was upset that he only got 4 shrimp in his shrimp and grits while I got around 10).  I realllllllllly like the food here.  The Brussels sprouts/farro/scallop salad is so flavorful and light.  It is a huge portion to boot.  The shrimp and grits has a nice grill to it, and the cutting board is a good mix of meat and cheese.  I liked all of the apps except for the calamari, which was just so-so.   I have tried three of the cocktails on the menu, and none of them were fantastic to me.  I was a little disappointed in their drink menu, but their full bar and nice selection of craft beers well makes up for it.  The space itself is such a cute theme with napkins that look like lined paper, to the menus that look like composition books, to the \"library\" wall inside the restaurant.  There is ample seating, a large patio, and even beer pong and Jenga for socializing.  Great spot for groups, a happy hour, or a date.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of great things about Public School 702, and I have to say they did not disappoint. The venue itself has a wonderful theme. There's memorabilia all over the restaurant from generations of different schools. The bar area is reminiscent of a gymnasium with bleachers and a scoreboard. There's also shuffleboard, beer pong, and extremely large Jenga. Right off the bat, I was impressed.  We were greeted promptly by our server, Jared Smith. He gave us a tour of the menu and went over the craft beer list. There are about 40 of them! He recommended the crushed velvet for me, as I'm not much of a beer drinker, and the tenaya brown for my husband, who is. The crushed velvet was delicious! It's like a blackberry Moscow mule. Next we ordered the mezze plate and the crispy cauliflower, based on Jared's recommendations, and both were delicious.  For dinner I ordered the salmon with succotash and my husband had the fried chicken and waffles, also Jared's recommendations. The salmon was fresh and paired delightfully with the succotash. The combination of the crushed velvet and the salmon was so good I had to order another one. My husband raved about his dish so of course I tried it, and yes it was delicious. A bit too many calories for me, but if that's no concern to you (and it's not too my husband), then this is the dish for you!  All in all it was a great experience and the bill was extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is light and fun, and the food and beverage are delightful. I was very impressed with Jared and his recommendations. We loved everything he picked, and he made the experience even more enjoyable. Public school - we will definitely be back!",

The decor is nice, I like the school theme and their menus look like composite notebooks. It's a nice theme without being tacky.  Drinks are reasonably priced and they have a great selection of brews.  The food was great, but I wish they had more options. My friend and I shared the chorizo mac n cheese, margherita pizza, parm truffle fries, and the mini cheeseburgers.   Overall, the food was good, wasn't a big fan of the mini cheeseburgers, nothing wrong with it, it was just a little bland, I would've preferred to have gotten something else. The pizza was great, fries were crispy and well-seasoned, and the mac n cheese was delicious!  Our server was great, she was very friendly and helpful in helping us pick some items. I would come back again though!",

The public school theme is fun and the memorabilia on the walls and around the venue gives you a fun look into Las Vegas's local past. The menu looked like a marble notebook and the cocktail napkin looked like a note passed from a classmate.                        Our server, Jared Smith gave us a great rundown of the menu and explained the beer selection really well. We were able to sample quite a few before making our selections and by the time we left the restaurant we had ordered almost all oft them.

I think the recipes lacked flavor, even though they were cooked well. Desert was just OK - you could tell it was store bought cake and ice cream. I had the deviled eggs and bison burger. Kale salad is good!  I'd definitely go there again and try more of their menu.",

    "text": "The gastropub scene with it's craft brews and tricked out Mac and cheeses is getting quickly saturated and fiercely competitive, leaving you grasping for differentiators to accurately recall where you dined the night before.   The beer itself won't do it anymore, nor will a quirky bacon wrapped or jammed fare.   The upstairs patio set up at Public School makes for a nice atmosphere reminiscent of Southern California, so good job there.   The beer selection doesn't hurt either.   Food is rather predictable, though still delicious and interesting to look at.   I decided to throw caution to the wind and go with lamb burger, laden with delicious, fatty, juicy calories, minus bun, plus quinoa salad. While the delicious fat made the burger...delicious, quinoa salad was very meh. I make better? No? You come my house, I feed you.   Here is my gripe. Yes, we were a group of 22. Yes, it's a PIA. But, we did have a reservation. So ok, can't put tables together- fine, three adjacent tables are totally cool. But not two waiters working at two VERY different speeds and on different schedules, completely independently of each other, except for coordinating the bill. So here it is- while I'm just putting my order in, my coworkers at the other table are getting their food delivered. A bit extreme, if you ask. So they have to wait and stare us down,  while we tuck the napkins into our collars.   Otherwise, everything went seamlessly. No special urge to go back.",

The restaurant itself is huge and has a fun schoolhouse vibe to it.   Our server was very attentive. As soon as we sat at the table, she greeted us kindly and offered to take our drink orders while we waited for our entire party to arrive. Throughout our dinner she continued to check in on us and kept the drinks flowing.   The FOOD!!!! Because many in our group were first timers to PS702 we decided to order everything center-table, family style. So glad we did, we were able to taste a good portion of the menu and leave with full and happy tummies! What we ordered...  Appetizers: Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower - My favorite out of the apps. Breaded and fried to perfection with a side of blue cheese aioli and buffalo sauce. Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos - While they were good, there really wasn't anything special about them. One order will give you 4 tacos. The Cutting Board - A very generous sized charcuterie board with a tasty selection of meats and cheeses. One board was large enough for our entire party to try.   Entrees: Shrimp & Grits - One of my favorite plates of the night! A ton of flavor and a nice portion. Short Rib - So tender and paired with horseradish mashed potatoes. Flat Iron Steak w/ Truffle Butter - I love anything truffle, but I didn't really taste it. The plate did come with chorizo mac and cheese which was the highlight of my night!  Jidori Chicken & Waffles - The entire dish was so flavorful! The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly.  Lamb Bolognese - My least favorite dish of the night... Don't order, try the above entrees instead!   I will definitely return! Maybe for their brunch!?!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. We live near downtown summerlin and were so excited to try out a new restaurant. Sadly, this place was beyond disappointing, but considering they are still working on getting the kinks out, we may be back.  Positives:  1) great setting, fun ambiance, great outdoor space with games, and fairly large space to get seated quickly.  2) Variety of interesting food and drink selections on the menu at a good price; good happy hour offerings  3) The ahi tacos and calamari were great. The blueberry lavender drink was tasty, but did not come with the sprig of lavender as pictured. Think it needed more lavender.  Negatives:  1) I ordered the ahi tuna tacos on the appetizer menu and asked that the tacos and slaw salad I ordered on the side come out together as my entree. The taco came out first, even before the appetizer we ordered and my salad came way later.  2) My husband ordered a burger medium. It came out literally raw! It could have made him sick. They made him a new one and took it off our check.  3) We ordered the Nutella Ice Cream sandwich after reading all the great reviews. There was WAX PAPER in our cookie which was used to put the ice cream on the sandwich. Additionally, the cookie was extremely hard and inedible.   4) A manager came to talk to us only after the food critic seated next to us told him what a bad experience we had. My only problem with this is that the server did not tell the manager to come talk to us after we received poor quality food. We talked to the manager who did not seem very apologetic but did give us his card if we wanted to come back. They should have comped us our meal based on our experience, but alas no offers.   I am understanding that the restaurant is new. Unlike Lazy Dog which is around the corner and trained their staff for two weeks prior to opening, Public School 702 seems to be lacking in food and service. I am hoping this will be worked out in the future. As I stated above, its a great spot and a shame if things don't pick up. It can only go up from here!",

We entered and had to stand behind them for like 2 minutes because the they were seem to be having their own conversations! As a valued customer to the restaurant should I disturb their little private conversations?? NO!!! finally the girl acknowledged that we are standing behind them and she said there is a wait for 25 minutes! And guess what?? We could see from where we are standing that there are so many seats available at the bar, where they fully serve all the menu items!!! And she didn't even bother to suggest that!!! Wow!! Felt like she think \"we don't want to be too busy\"!!!  And since we know we can sit at the bar, we went there and sat. I ordered two appetizers, two entrees and two cocktails as usual! My pasta was cold, but I sent back to warm it up. During this time someone took away all the utensils assuming that I am done eating, therefore I had to wait another few minutes get new utensils again!

Sadly she was the last staff member that spoke to us.  Sat at the table waiting to have someone stop by and maybe take our drink order but we never had a wait staff  member stop by.  Had several wait staff walk by but they never said a word or made eye contact with us.  They waited on the tables on both sides of us.  I can't recommend the place.  When asked I will let everyone know how bad our experience was.  Don't waste your time, we had dinner at another place close by and it was great.",

All the servers were exceptionally well but the one that stood out the most was the manager Tommy. He was so energetic and I could tell he truly enjoyed his job & the company he works for. He was able to answer all my questions about all the items on the menu that I wanted to know more about. Tommy knew the menu as if he wrote it himself. He was very persistent & would always come back to the table to make sure we were doing good. Something most managers in other places don't do. This was the best service I've gotten In a long time. He kept a smile on his face & continued to be extremely helpful. I will be sure to come back here while also advising all my friends to go. If I could give him 10 stars I would, but I guess 5 will do :)",

    "text": "Okay so I'll start out with the bad first, the kitchen was slow and we had little particles floating around in our water and some on the sides of the glass which you can see. Our server was very kind. She seemed like she was running around in the beginning, she got to our table and was out of breath. I just wanted to tell her to take it easy lol. We ordered a Bloody Mary half way through our meal and although it was garnished with a chicken wing we couldn't finish it because it was too spicy, salty, etc. I would say try to make the drink like more of a drink than a spicy sauce for a hickey wing. It was just too spicy to the point that we only sipped maybe 25% of the drink (4 of us were sipping on it). But now onto the good stuff! The food was amazing. We had the calamari and chorizo Mac and cheese for an appetizer, I didn't get a picture when it first came out due to the fact that I was excited and hungry. The calamari was delicious and a good size as an appetizer for 5 people. The chorizo Mac and cheese was \"the shit\"! Never tasted any Mac and cheese quite like this one, they even come with potato chips on top to give 'em a little crunch. Next up was my entree, I had the fish and chips and to say the least it was good. It didn't have the right flavor I was looking for but mind you, it was my first time EVER ordering fish and chips, so for those of you who like fish and chips and love tartar sauce, this is the place you that you should go to. Next came dessert, and since we waited a while to get our food they gave us a complimentary dessert which were the Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the lemon merengue. The desserts were outstanding! Just keep in mind lemon merengue packs a little punch but it was delicious. I rated this place 4 stars because the food is awesome, and even though the kitchen was slow management actually showed that they cared about our dining experience. There are a few things that need to be fixed like the little particles in the water, maybe tone all the spices down in the Bloody Mary as well. But other than that I have no complaints because the food was absolutely delicious, and that's what I went there for right?! Definitely a spot to check out, it's on the second floor so it had a pretty cool view.",

As you walk through the dining area, you come upon these giant globes hanging from the ceiling, which reminded me just of the solar system in my school library. We were seated at a table with chairs, but there are also booths and bar seating. The chairs are a cute small scale black metal chair, of course following the school motif, but are not at all comfortable. It's very noisy in here, but it didn't affect our conversation too much. The menu is very different, but some safe choices too. Bangers and mash, fish and chips, pizza, etc. I ordered the Mac and cheese app as my meal accompanied with a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was forgotten and I had to ask for it, not a big deal..it wasn't too spicy, just the right amount. The Mac had chorizo in it, which I found way too salty. My friend had fish and chips. She said it was good, but the fries were even better! As an appetizer, we opted for the calamari. It came with a ginger aioli that was delish. The calamari was heavily breaded, but ok. I'd like to go back when it's a bit warmer as they have outdoor seating looking down on the courtyard. We asked for a to-go box and also received a brown paper bag labeled 'homework', so cute!",

I looked for \"best burgers\" here on Yelp, and found that Public School had a location in Summerlin. He had a PB & J burger in an L.A. location once and always mentioned it when listing his favorite burgers. I surprised him on our first day here and he was so happy. The burger was everything he remembered. I tried the Hot Mess. EASILY THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I'm not one to exaggerate about food, so when I tell you I have thought of that amazing, hot, perfect combination of bread, turkey, cheese, jalapenos and caramelized onions every day of this week long trip? I mean it. We leave tomorrow, but not before I have the Hot Mess. I'm so grateful we have one in Southern California ... although LA is a good distance from Orange County. It's. Worth. It. The food is great, well-timed, and the perfect temperature. The service is helpful and friendly, without being intrusive. The decor is a great riff on the nostalgia of school days. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

    "text": "They took their theme all out I will def say that! Lol The whole place is decorated with school like things and even the menus look like notebooks.   So went here for brunch with the hubby and his parents on New Year's Day. We sat outside on one of the patios upstairs and it was really perfect to soak in the sun and fresh air after being couped up in that red rock casino resort for days! It was slightly nippy out so they even turned on the outdoor heater in our booth for us which was a nice touch. And overall the service was really good!! We ordered: the edamame hummus appetizer, the handheld Cobb , a stuffed French toast and a regular breakfast.  The best thing was honestly the hummus it got scrapped completely clean with the delicious grilled flat bread pieces it's served with. Next me and the hubby shared the Cobb sandwich. It was very flavorful since it was packed with ingredients. A little messy due to the fried egg on top but as always a fried egg on top wins this girls vote.  I will say there were a few misses. The aforementioned egg had quite a bit of completely uncooked whites. The quinoa salad that we got with  the sandwich was completely flavorless. Not sure why you wouldn't dress a salad like that at all. And the MILs crispy smashed potatoes with her eggs were impressively crispy looking but had no salt so we're disappointing. The FIL said his stuffed French toast wasn't stuffed ( I didn't taste it at all) but I looked nice at least.  The extras: they have a bunch of beer pong tables outside on those patios and a shuffleboard table inside by the bar so it def seems like a fun place for happy hour.",

    "text": "In the Summerlin neighborhood so decided to visit a place the kids have gone to. We were pleasantly surprised as to how big the place is. Bar area is large and there is also an outside area. We noticed that they have brunch specials on Saturday and Sunday. They also have for $15.00 with an entree you can get up to four refills of your drink, i think there were mimosas, bloody Mary's and two other choices. I'm sure this would, have been great if we didn't need to drive home. I settled for the crushed velvet and it is like a Moscow mule. I have to say it was tasty and the berries were big and juicy. Hubby had a blonde beer and was delighted that it was chilled nicely. This place has a lot of unique items on the menu so if you are looki g for traditional food, this is not a place for you to eat. We shared Chorizo Mac n cheese and I had the Shrimp grits, it looked a little intimidating but once I tasted it, it was  Amazing. Hubby ordered the CCB which was a chicken patty type burger with a fried egg in it. Not really his cup of tea, said it might have been better with a fried chicken breast. He said it was a little dry and chalky. Our waitress Amberlyn was a sweetheart, very attentive and came back to make sure things were right and if we needed anything. I would have liked to try the desserts they have but I was very full. I think this would be a good place to meet up with friend for drinks.",

    "text": "If not for their loyalty club, The Insider, I'd probably stay away. There always seems to be some issue with the menu items, or the drink selection, or promos, etc.  But I'm a sucker for a loyalty club!   I went on a weekday evening to redeem my Birthday Reward, and one person joined me. We sat at the bar and I ordered the Flight School- $5 for 3 chosen local craft brews (4 ouncers), per the e-mail from PS 702 I received.  The bartender told me their $5 flight wasn't local brews. I did what any reasonable person would- ask if they have local brews. And showed him the email.  Lo and behold, after consulting with a manager, the $5 local brews flight was mine! Well, 2 of the beers were local- a porter from Hop Nuts, and the brew from Bad Beat escapes me. My friend is not so much a beer snob and was happy to get the \"ordinary\" $5 flight. Whatever that was, I didn't really care!  Service was good, and as always, we were offered samples as we inquired about certain beers, or in my case, the Rose on tap. I had a glass and wasn't impressed. My friend had the wings and said they were great. I ordered a Benedict pizza to go, and it was very good the next day. This is a menu item that used to be available at brunch only. It's very rich, filling and tasty! It has fancy ham, cheese, roasted brussel sprouts and is topped with eggs. Recommended for breakfast, lunch or dinner!",

She ordered a side of asparagus and it also had no flavor at all.  I ordered a PB and J burger. I like to try new things so I decided to try it.

    "text": "Based on what I tried, this place is acceptable. I tried the Fried Jidori Chicken & Waffles, PB&J Burger, and Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower.   Fried Jidori Chicken & Waffles -- 3 stars -- the fried chicken wasn't crispy and the over-easy egg on top didn't help with the lack of crispiness. The waffles weren't crispy and quite soggy, but had some nice heat from the green chili. Overall, I found dish to be lackluster.  PB&J -- 4 stars -- creative twist to the good ole hamburger. Nice balance between nutty, sweet, and savory in each bite. Patty was cooked medium as requested. 1-star ding because it could have been bigger given the price.  Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower -- 3 stars -- deep friend cauliflower with some buffalo and blue cheese sauces. Expected much more from on usually a cool twist on cauliflower. My issue was that the cauliflower could have been softer, considering it was deep fried.  5 stars for ambiance -- old school bleachers on the wall, 80's theme, and other retro designs. Pretty cool and nice music.  Wasn't crowded for Saturday brunch.  Plenty of parking since it's anchored to the Downtown Summerlin mall.",

Here's the deal...the food is good, the beer selection is good, the menu selection is ok and would rank 3-1/2 to 4 stars on their own. The layout and theme of this place do rate 4 stars as well...but when you take a good restaurant and have excellent waitstaff, it kicks it up a notch.  Our server, Victoria, was certainly the highlight of the evening. Wife and I totally appreciated her suggestions, her great attitude, and attentiveness.  We had a few appetizers, deviled eggs (with crispy prosciutto)..a little underseasoned but very tasty. (hey chef...salt and pepper are your friends in the kitchen)  Meatballs Al Forno...these were perfect (some of the best ever) with a little heat to the sauce and grilled levain...which is an ostentatious way of saying tiny pieces of grilled sourdough bread. Chef...more sauce and a couple more pieces of bread...uhhh...levain.  For DInner, wife had the Pan Seared Salmon which she loved and I had the Skirt Steak Tacos with a side of Bacon Cheddar Tots. Tacos were a little on the dry side but tasty and the tots were amazing with the sriracha ketchup.   All in all, for the menu, they have a little room for improvement. You guys make it fun so we'll be coming back to school for more lessons.",

We ordered a decent amount of food. They were cooked well and there was plenty. The price was reasonable. I ordered the appetizer and I ate it like a main course meal. The calamari and crispy naked wings were great. I enjoyed the ahi tuna poke & this is the only place that I felt provided enough chips for the ahi tuna (I usually ask for more at other places). I highly recommend the brussels spouts... I never had it before but I totally enjoyed it.   Drink meal, they have a variety of choices.

    "text": "You know when you walk into a room and people just kind of stare at you for a second because they feel like you shouldn't be there or something? Then it just brings some awkwardness in? Yeah. That happened. Was it because I looked lost? Was it because I had my younger sister with me? Not sure. But I can tell you that the next family who came in was treated with much more respect and there wasn't any awkwardness at all. Was it because they were white? Not sure. I hate pulling the race card, but that's what it felt like in this case.  So that was the start of that. Not too great.  We asked to sit outside. On one side there empty tables in the shade. On the other side, there were tables in the bright Las Vegas sun that wasn't really wanted at that moment. Like I was already sweating. I asked the server if we could be moved or something and she was like, \"uhh well I can't move you myself you have to talk to one of the other girls\". So I get that. But she kept saying it over and over. I ended up saying something like \"dude, that one chick who seated us here was hella awkward and I would much rather not talk to her again.\" That finally got her to get someone else and we were seated inside.  It was pretty slow when we went. It was a Saturday afternoon. When we were seated we were probably left alone for about 15 minutes. We were ready to walk out already. Finally our server came by and gave us some room temperature water with no ice in our tiny glasses. I think this is standard but if we're only drinking water then shouldn't we get bigger glasses? With ICE? It's a bar. I'm sure you had larger glasses somewhere. When she came by we ordered and we sat there and waited for our food.   Shortly after, the food starts coming out. First the poke. It was alright. Not the flavor I was looking for. It needed some salt or something. We didn't have salt or pepper at the table so that kind of sucked. Forgot to ask though. We then got the buffalo cauliflower which wasn't bad at all. I can see why it's one of their most popular items. We also got the bacon tater tots (forgot the name exactly) and they were okay. The margherita pizza came out cold. Don't know why it was cold. The cheese was pretty solid and it was pretty lackluster. The hipsterness of the place didn't make it as fun as it seemed.  Overall the experience wasn't great. I wouldn't come back. Even as we were leaving I felt like we were being judged or something by stepping in the place at all. I felt unwelcomed from the start and I should have listened to my gut feeling. Waste of money, waste of time.",

They ran out of one of the mixers for the Bloody Mary. We mentioned to the manager when she stopped by our table and she was unaware and not too concerned. They allow vaping on patio, stinks. We rec'd a cloud of smoke blowing our way.  Won't be going back.",

    "text": "In the area today and decided to try this place out, thought it would be a good experience for brunch on a Sunday. It turned out to be the opposite, with loud kids playing on the tabletop shuffle board in the bar area, which shouldn't have been allowed and its noticed that \" no one under 21 is allowed in this area\". But kids were making too much noise and it was hard to enjoy the meal. I feel they should move that shuffleboard outside in the patio so the noise of the pucks do not bother guests!  The meal itself was cold and was not even HOT! I have a feeling the food may have been sitting for sometime before it was brought to us. I had ordered the bottomless mimosa and it wasn't even chilled! A little cold to the drink would have been better!  Service was very very slow when it was not even busy when we arrived, a few tables in the open seating bar area and on the other side there were a few tables as well!   Lastly, walked out of the not feeling good at all!    NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!",

    "text": "Another great place for food. Enjoyed the setting - place looked good, and it was casual enough that I wasn't intimidated at all. The staff was also friendly and efficient.  We got there while they were serving brunch on Saturday afternoon around 1PM, so I got to splurge on their Beermosa. Pretty yummy for my first beer cocktail. What else did we get... Umm... Appetizers: Speck & Eggs and Chorizo Mac & Cheese. I, myself, definitely liked both. The boyfriend also had to admit that this was one of the best deviled eggs he's had for the hint of spice they add for flavor.  Entree: House Pepperoni Pizza for the boyfriend, and a Crispy Chicken Sandwich for me. LOL. Boyfriend enjoyed the pizza, but he was peeved that I told him we'd be having spaghetti for dinner with my family... \"I'm having Italian twice today?!\" XD My sandwich was awesome! Chicken was cooked very well, and I appreciated the crunchy exterior for texture, plus it looked good. Real good... Also enjoyed their version of aioli sauce to the last drop. Oh! I also have to add that the ketchup has a small kick to it. I seriously thought my taste buds were outta whack until I had my boyfriend confirm it wasn't just me drinking too much.  The cool part was the Banana Bread Pudding. Hehehe... Dessert ended the meal on a really good note. You have to ask your server about their dessert menu though 'cause it's verbally described to you. Not including tip for everything we had, it came out to be around $63. Worth it...! LOL. Now I know why my sister and brother-in-law keep coming out here without me.",

It was a Wednesday and we were easily able to choose our seats. By the time we left, I was glad we came early, because the bar and the restaurant were really filling up. Ladies, there's hooks to hang your purses at the bar. I swear bars always get points from me for this!   I had the Mule kick for my cocktail...tasty but heavy on the ginger. For our food we ordered only from the happy hour menu which they call, Recess.  The deviled eggs were sharp in their taste and yummy.  I will get those again. I'm not usually one for the tastes of fried food but the fried cauliflower was awesome. It was light and tasty-I'd get these again as well. We also got the hummus with quinoa; the flavor was on the light side with a healthier feel. I'd get these again.   My favorite, which came by a complete surprise because I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter, were the PB&j sidekicks. These mini burgers with a touch of peanut butter were so delightful that I'm having to rethink peanut butter again",

When I requested marinara it arrived ice cold with zero flavor. For $12 we received $1 worth of product. Three of us ordered and each dish was just ok. I had the poblano peppers with rice. Just ok. My friends had shrimp with white cheddar grits and fish and chips. Well .. I think nice plump shrimps would be the way to go not medium sized average shrimps. And the fish and chips ... really greasy while the breading was extremely larger than the piece of fish. Very disappointing. Not thrilled with the Pinot Noir selection.

Additionally, I requested a straw so i wouldn't have to put my lips on the glass for water and I was brought out a cocktail stir stick not a straw. I would AVOID this place like the plague if deciding to come her for lunch, perhaps dinner is better but I won't be coming back to find out. I will be letting family and friends know of the disappointment this place is, and that they should avoid it. Go eat at California Pizza kitchen or even Wolf gang Puck instead (slightly better portion size and better food). Disappointed in leaving this place still hungry ...

    "text": "***edited*** Two years later, and I wouldn't go back EVER AGAIN. Everything we ordered was wrong on our most recent trip. Service was AWFUL. We had to get our own silverware and napkins (asked several times for them and I finally gave up and got them myself). After my food finally came out, the second time, they brought half of my meal & it was still raw. We had to ask to speak to a manager THREE times. On the third time I started a timer to see how long it would take. It was almost 10 minutes before my friend just went and found her. I'll never go back***  2015: Seriously impressed. We came in for Fathers Day as a last minute decision, and I'm very glad we did. The service was rocky at first, but quickly turned a corner and I was very pleased. We ordered the pancetta deviled eggs, a Bloody Mary and a draft beer to start. Everything was great. The Mary's are SPICY, so if that isn't your thing- be forewarned - I believe the spicier the better. It comes topped with a chicken wing (would have preferred bacon and olives or something else). My husband ordered the adobo tacos with rice and I ordered the CCB with brown bag fries and sriracha ketchup. The first burger came out slightly raw. When I let the server know she was so wonderful and the manager came over and let us know how sorry he was. They sent out a new one and it was better than I expected. The sriracha ketchup had just the right amount of kick- I really liked it. Even though we were stuffed, we saw a Lemon Meringue pass by and I couldn't help but order. I'm so glad I did. It is probably one of the best lemon meringues I've ever had.  All in all, I highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely check it out for Recess soon with my friends.",

We got the Parmesan truffle frites, speck & eggs, crispy naked wings, and crispy ahi tuna tacos. The one thing that was worth it we're the truffle fries and ahi tuna tacos. The food is decent. You can tell that they are trying to bring different flavor and style to their menu. The wings tasted like fried chicken and side note - they don't have ranch.

I didn't. :) Upon looking at their menu online I was worried as it didn't show prices. To me, this usually means it's going to be expensive.   The menus took me back to my school days as their brunch menu was a test scantron and the regular menu was a composition book. Being as it was lunch and I wasn't feeling breakfast so much I went with the Bison BBQ burger. At the beginning the servers were attentive, but closer to the end of my meal, they stopped coming by as much and I waited a while for the bill.  My burger was tasty.  However, I didn't taste any BBQ sauce which I was rather disappointed with. The cheese ratio was astounding! Usually I feel restaurants skimp on the cheese, but here it covered the whole burger. It also came with a side of fries and sriracha ketchup.  The fries were ok, and although I can't eat spicy the ketchup was addicting!   The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice. They played reggae tunes which made me feel like I was at home in Hawaii.  The decor was eccelectic and kept my eyes wandering.   I had a great experience here and would love to come back to try other foods and their beers.  I hear they have a great happy hour.",

They were just concerned about my fiance and trying to make sure he didn't take a bite of the burger that had mushrooms. Plus Jason had so much energy and passion. I worked in customer service and I can tell when someone enjoys their job and loves to make customers happy.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since I stumbled upon it. I finally stopped in one Sunday. I immediately loved the layout and atmosphere and the hostess was pleasant. I sat at the bar and ordered the buffalo cauliflower and a blackened caesar salad. The cauliflower was good. It's fried hard and different than other buffalo cauliflower I've had. The salad took about 30-40\" to receive as according to the manager and waitress it was overlooked. I was understanding initially, but after I was told it was a priority it still took another 15\" or so. By that time, I was over the whole experience. It finally arrived and I took a few bites before packing it to go. My one piece of feedback on the salad is to use a high quality Parmesan. It can make an average caesar salad exceptional. Anywho, the staff was very apologetic and the cauliflower was comped it just wasn't an exceptional experience. Let's see how the next one goes when I return.",

    "text": "Upon my first visit of Public School, I was not impressed. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, but the food fell flat.   I decided to give this place another shot, after a few great suggestions from friends. On my most recent visit to Public School I started with a great beer, appetizer, then my entree. I order the bacon cheddar tots and for my entree I ordered the delicious crispy chicken sandwich. I know a chicken sandwich sounds pretty basic, but this wasn't just an ordinary chicken sandwich. It had a special sauce with pickles and kale, it was a mix between sweet and salty. If I go back, I would probably order this yummy sandwich again because it was yum!  I love the decor and the school related theme. How genius of someone to create a restaurant related to school. This is so relatable and depending on the time of your visit the menu change. If you visit during brunch, then you may have a test menu. If you visit during happy hour or dinner, then you will have a cute composition book.  The also offer great outdoor seating that offers an amazing view of local shoppers and the beautiful sky. My favorite is to visit at night and looking up at the stars, while I enjoy a beer.   This is a great spot for a intimate date with your significant other, or a fun place to catch up with friends.",

The fries were seasoned just right and crunchy - just how I like it. My boyfriend ordered these tater tots with cheese and bacon inside - super savory and delicious. I always love going to new restaurants with a unique theme/decor going on and Public School definitely stands out. Lastly, our waitress was probably the most friendly and prompt waitress I've had in a while. She always had a smile on her face and a great attitude, participated in conversation with my friends and I, checked on us several times and offered refills, and made sure to say goodbye before we left. We didn't have to wait long for anything that we ordered or requested. Really wish I got her name, but thanks for the amazing service!",

Our server was very flamboyant, patient, friendly, and blunt (I guess depending of what kind of vibe you give off). We adored him! He always made sure to check on us but gave us enough space while socializing and giving good vibes to his other guests and co-workers.  Our food was delicious as always! My husband loves the bison burger. It's the right amount of tenderness and juicy goodness.  I ordered something a bit different - the Thai Noodles Shrimp Salad. Really good with the soba noodles but there was a tad bit too much bitterness from the purple cabbage and the arugula. The dressing it's in was sweet but one you bite into too much of arugula or cabbage, it kinda leaves a bad taste.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommended family and friends to come here!",

The cocktail menu is also pretty good. The menu is rather limited. I prefer to order from the appetizer menu. I would enjoy a more diverse offering or at least new menu items every few months. Service is usually good. I had one occasional when we were not greeted for about 20 minutes or so, but the manager rectified the situation.   Overall, I would recommended that you try this restaurant. If you would like a decent sit down meal after a day of shopping, you may find Public School appetizing.",

    "text": "Met some friends up for brunch on a sunny Saturday morning. Since it was such a nice day out, we decided to dine outside. The outside has a few games which include giant size Connect Four and Jenga. The theme of the restaurant is cute. Their regular menu is designed to look like those composite notebooks and the brunch menu is a scantron(brings back memories doesn't it?). We all ordered bottomless mimosas...which turned out that meant you get a maximum of 5 (or maybe it was 6?) medium carafes. I guess it's good that they put a cap on how much you can have but should it really be called \"bottomless\" then? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still plenty and I got a good buzz from all that we drank but still. However, a plus is that they have beermosa, michelada, and bloody mary and you can switch it up if you like. Anyways, on to the food!  Crispy buffalo cauliflower: lightly fried cauliflower that came with a side of buffalo and ranch sauce. I liked this one and would recommend. The cauliflower wasn't mushy at all.   Chorizo mac and cheese: this was probably my favorite. It had a lot of flavor and I enjoy the pasta that they used.   Fried chicken and green chili cornbread waffles: this one was just alright. I wasn't a fan of the texture of the cornbread waffle and the green chili sauce was forgettable.   Fire roasted vegetable hash and eggs: this was my least favorite. It didn't have much flavor and was too bland for me. I felt like they literally put a whole can of black beans in there and that's just too much for me.   Eggs Benedict pizza: this was pretty tasty. Prosciutto gave it a nice, salty flavor and the crust had a nice char to it. You can tell it was cooked in a brick oven.   Stuffed French toast: this one was good! It was filled with different berries. I thought it would be really sweet by the way it looked but it wasn't! It had a nice sweet flavor without being overwhelming.   Our waitress was great! She was knowledgeable on the menu and answered any questions that we had. She also did a great job of keeping our drinks full.   Overall, I feel the food is just okay. I'm not in a huge hurry to come back anytime soon but glad I gave it a try.",

When I walked in, the manager Randy who was working at the time and the bar tender , Jeremy were very pleasant and helpful.  Last time I had tried a burger that to me was very mediocre. But This time I was told that I should give the BBQ Bison burger a shot as well as the crispy Chicken sandwich. Both were great! Much better food and much better experience than my last visit.   Because of that I left a generous tip and I'm excited to go back and try different things!   I also heard a rumor that the Sous chef is now the head chef? Maybe that had something to do with the quality of the food. But needles to say I'm very satisfied now!   Thanks for the good food and good service!   I'll be back on another Tuesday industry night soon.   Cheers! - foodingwithBobo",

Nothing really wrong, but definitely below expectations. We then had the BBQ bison burger which was pretty good but again not memorable. I will say the carrot slaw was really tasty and what gastro pub food is all about! The MAC was super disappointing. The flavors did not go well together at all. The cobbler had the smallest bit of ice cream and blackberries are a bit tart so we weren't impressed there either. The decor is great and well thought thru.",

Their menu has different options compared to your traditional weekend hot spot.   There food options are wide just to name a few :  Kale Ceasar salad   Buffalo cauliflower   The cutting board - meats cheeses and grapes   Bangers n Mash - chicken herb sausages with Brussel bacon mash   The Hotmess - turkey sandwich with au jus  Chicken & Quinoa Salad   bison burger  the PB & J burger pizzas etc   Drinks : There cocktails are constantly changing. They have a descent selection of craft beers as well.   The bloodymary comes with a chicken wing ! Eat that right away before it soaks in your vodka.

    "text": "Think about Yard House but with a school theme, better food, and a more limited drink menu.   LOCATION & ATMOSPHERE Located in Downtown Summerlin's little circle of restaurants and random rock formation fountain, Public School 702 gives off that perfect local hangout vibe. It's always poppin' every time I've been. The restaurant itself is very large and they really stick to the schoolhouse vibe (the menus are super cute composite notebooks!).   It's obvious Public School 702 is a recent addition to an already successful chain of restaurants. I love that they make each location unique to its area code, including the menus.  SERVICE If service was amazing this place would definitely be a 5/5 in my book. It can get very unorganized and since the employees are dressed casually it's sometimes difficult to tell who is who. In addition, some of them are not the friendliest people and I sometimes feel like I'm burdening them when I keep having to get their attention.  However, some servers are super friendly and go above and beyond. It really is hit or miss here. One cool thing is that you can get samples of any of the drinks! They bring you a little shot glass of beer to try things out.  FOOD & DRINK Two words: CUTTING. BOARD.  I don't know why I'm so obsessed with it but the Cutting Board ($14 appetizer charcuterie plate) is just bomb to me! It's a combination of the delicious cured meats, cheese, and thin crispy bread. They meld together so well! Also love the onion and capers. It's so worth.  Also the AHI TUNA TACOS are amazing. I have never liked those kind of newfangled tacos (I'll stick to my adobada and tripa, thank you) but this one had the perfect amount of freshness, delicate fish, and thin crisp. It just melts in your mouth! $10 gets you 4 tacos.  I had a couple other dishes but none of them really made an impression. As for drinks, I have only tried a few of the craft beers on their menu. Campfire Stout is alright but I was happy to see they carried Ninkasi Dawn of the Red.   The bill can get a little costly here (depending on your appetite for food and alcohol) but sometimes it's worth the splurge, especially if you get to sit on the balcony on a nice evening. I have yet to hit up their happy hour but will definitely come back soon!",

The conclusion that I have reached is that the back of the house (food) is well run while the front of the house (wait and bar staff) is not.   Their menu is creative and the food is quite good. In the past I have ordered the brussels sprouts salad, the shrimp and grits and the salmon. The food was delivered in a timely manner.   However, they have staffing issues. On the server side, I think they are just short of experienced servers. The couple of times that I did not eat at the bar the server had a trainee with them. If the restaurant succeeds, this should correct itself.  My criticism of the bar staff is more problematic. With the exception of one nice fellow, Simon,  the boss bartender and the other staff were condescending and slow to serve. I felt as if somehow I did something wrong or that I was sitting at the losers table.  Las Vegas is home to the the world's best hospitality workers. Can't they find people that like other people and want to make them feel welcomed?  Each time I have been to the restaurant I have had a similar experience. Managers wake up! You have a not nice, too cool for school attitude percolating in the front of the house.",

Everything he suggest was absolutely mouth watering from beer to food, and he worked with us to accommodate a friends special dietary needs. We had Frito pie, bangers and mash and Jidori chicken after our deviled eggs appetizer.  The patio is beautiful. Can't wait to bring family from out of town and coworkers here!!!  Keep up the good work!!!",

The French toast tasted terrific (but the bread could be thinner) and the Bloody Mary mix is delicious.   Definitely worth trying if you've not yet been.",

I had never heard of PS before, but when I arrived, I fell in love with the decor and ambiance. As I was walking towards PS, I could see my boys waving to me through the glass wall from the balcony. What a wonderful welcome to a new hot spot. The food was good & the server was the best server we have had in a long time.   I admit, I had an event later that evening, so I arrived late joining the family for dinner at PS & left early to go to my event, but my experience was really good. I liked the food and I'm looking forward to going back again soon so I can write a more detailed review.  Shannon & the grandparents weren't as impressed as I was. We all agreed that the tater tots were the best item we had. And the kids meals were extremely small.",

I had the bison burger, and it was delicious ! The meat was tender and cooked to perfection! The side of fries were excellent as well and i really enjoyed the siracha ketchup. I also recommend their house pepperoni pizza. It has a thin, crunchy crust, and is topped with fresh jalapenos and incredible pepperoni. This is great place to come with friends, especially during \"recess\" AKA happy hour. Definitely will be returning to public school 702!",

I stood at the hostess stand for about 30-45 seconds while three employees walked past but none of them acknowledged me. Luckily, my party wasn't seated too far away so I was able to spot them from the door. There were six of us and the server was great. Also, the seating was comfortable. I ordered the chicken waffles. I'm weird and don't like eggs so I passed on the fried egg that that the dish is served with. The chicken was good but the waffle was pretty dry. I wouldn't order it again. The almost bottomless drinks are a good deal - 4 for $10. I had mimosas and they were tasty.",

Read all these great reviews, was so excited to try it, as we approached the door there was a girl smoking RIGHT in front of the door and proceeded to flick her cigarette butt right in front of the door while making eye contact, she knew it was not the place. This was tile ground, not some dirty park. Bad first impression. The first 2 tables we tried to sit at were covered in leftover food. It was a slow night so if a restaurant doesn't know serving 101, clean your tables after the guests leave there was no way we trusted the rest of the cleanliness. We sat for 5 mins and still no one cared to wipe/sanitize the tables. The back of the house must be filthy if that is the standard of the front of the house. Again, slow night, employees just standing around. We walked out. Downtown Summerlin has a lot of restaurant options that I'm sure sanitize and clean up after their guests.",

You would think that you're paying for an alcoholic beverage as if you were on the strip. A Hennessey and Coke cost $15 and then for a double shot it was another eight. I think they are too high and prices and this is supposed to be a family mall a locals mall and it doesn't come off that way. The food though is definitely worth going there for.

Overall, it was ok. Service is a little slow and I don't know why the servers keep bringing food and asking if it's your order. No organization what food to which table? Bringing food we didn't order. Server passed by to our table and brought our order to the table next to us then came back to us. I'll review the food we ordered. Sorry no pictures :(. #1 Calamari: 4 stars. good and not greasy #2 Ahi tuna crunchy tacos: 5 stars. our favorite, nice combinations of flavors and the crunch #3 Orange juice: 5 stars. so refreshing and mellow tartness of the citrus.  #5 Fish and chips: 1 star for fish. I'm always on search of good fish and chips. And I thought I'll find the good one here but nope. I don't like too much breadings on fish since they get to oily. We felt like we were eating oil instead of fish. 5 stars on the chips. Crunchy, not oily and perfectly seasoned.  #6 Kids mac n cheese: 5 stars. Kid and parents approved.  #7 Nutella cookie ice cream sandwich: 3 stars. Chewy cookies with a nice crunch outside. It has some bacon bits to add a little salty contrast on all the sweetness. It's good but nothing to dream about.   This place got a nice ambiance. The menus, napkins and decors are very cool. Coming back?  Maybe.",

They need some more popular beers on tap though, not just forcing you to drink a craft beer. The menu had some nice and some not nice ideas. I ordered the flat iron steak (medium rare) and it came rare, way too many potato chip on top of the Mac and cheese it came with. Also found a old dried out piece of Canadian bacon in my Mac and cheese, turned me off to the whole meal after that. Decent ideas for food but you probably have inexperienced cooks behind the line cause from experience that's what it seems like to screw up such an expensive but simple dish. Probably won't come back for a long time. Grape street is still way better.",

Who has 8 bartenders behind the bar and 6 people at the bar and no one can get a drink? While one of the bartenders drinks a redbull, people wait to be helped. So we try again and sit outside at a table, once again no one would acknowledge us for (not exaggerating) almost an hour. No one would ask us if we needed a drink or food. Servers walk by over and over again. This place is a JOKE! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible service! An amazing concept... Great outdoor seating, great setup, this place honestly has a lot of potential.... But management needs to Fire their whole staff and try again!!!! Sadly a disappointment.",

As opposed to our last visit, service was very good, but then the restaurant did only have a smattering of guests.  Food?  A different story!  I asked if the Thai noodle salad with chicken and shrimp would be enough for lunch.  Server said, \"Absolutely!\"  Well, he was wrong!  I usually take leftovers home with me.  I actually left hungry, and came home and had a sandwich!  For $14, I thought it would have at least a small chicken breast.  It only had one small shredded piece about the size of my little finger and 2 mini pieces of shrimp!  Salad was bland, with little flavor.  I also detected no cilantro.   One friend ordered the chicken breast sandwich with bacon and avocado.  It was served on a nice bun with fries.  She said it was good.   After 2 pathetic experiences, I probably won't be back.  There are just too many choices in the area.  It is no surprise the restaurant was nearly empty during what should be a noon rush hour.",

This went on for like 2 days of me calling them and them not answering any of my messages. Finally I got fed up and emailed their corporate office and voila the next day Nick emails his apology and is now able to accomodate our party but of course I already made reservations to another place (at Lazy Dog) which literally just took me 2 mins. over the phone to do.

    "text": "I came  to Public School 702 on a Wednesday night with my cousin. We had just finished watching a movie so we decided to check it out. The restaurant was easy to find and the host at the front was friendly. They have outdoor and indoor seating. We wanted to sit outside but the host informed us that we would have to wait so we opted to sit inside to avoid the wait and check out the restaurant's decor.  Being a high school teacher, I absolutely adored the restaurant's decor. It was decorated with school memoriabilia including trophies, books, etc. They also had an awesome solar system model hanging from the ceiling and other school themed canvases on the wall.The menus resembled composition notebooks which was a cute touch as well. The restaurant stayed True to its \"public school\" theme.  As far as the food, we were not super hungry so we decided to order small. We asked the server for recommendations and she was able to give recommendations for each category which was nice. However, being that we do not eat pork, there were limited options of what we could get in the entree section. Almost every dish has bacon in it, so if you love bacon, this is your place! The menu also seems to cater to an older crowd and seemed not so kid friendly. I did not see if there was a kid's menu but I'm assuming they don't have one since most of the people in the restaurant were 21+.  We ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower along with the Irish stout braised  ribs. The buffalo cauliflower was actually pretty great. I am not a fan of cauliflower but it was perfectly breaded and tasted just like a buffalo wing. It was served with horseradish and buffalo sauce. I was okay with the buffalo sauce but absolutely hated the horseradish sauce. I figured they would at least have the option of ranch but the server said they did not serve ranch but they could offer aioli which I politely declined. I'm a ranch type of girl so I thought it was weird to have buffalo sauce flavored food without it. Regardless of the ranch though, the buffalo cauliflower is definitely one to try. The Irish stout braised ribs were also delicious. The runner for our food said it was the best entree on the menu and she was right! The meat was boneless and so tender. It paired up perfectly with the mashed potatoes served under it. I would definitely recommend ordering this dish!  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is calm and seems sort of like a lounge. Our server was pleasant but took a while bringing us our check after we had asked for it. She stood by another table talking for almost 5 minutes so it was irritating to wait when we had asked for it before that. Once we got our check, we saw that our meal came out to about $30 for the two dishes, which was not too bad I guess. The only issues I have with this place is not having ranch but also the server giving us our check late. Other than those two issues, the place was nice to try and had tasty food! I'm giving it 3 stars because although it was good and a great place to try, I don't know if I'll come back again by choice.",

Their banana pudding was not bad but I enjoyed the whip cream more than the actual pudding. I'm glad I tried this place but I probably won't be back any time soon.

The happy hour is only available if you sit at one of those tables at the bar area. Instead of taking our names and seat us when the next table opens up, the hostess told us to walk around and see if any tables opens up. There was no order to this chaos. It's like driving in a parking lot looking for parking spot. Just because you got there first doesn't mean you'll get seated first. You also need luck. People came after you could find openings before you do.   2. We were told by friends that you can sign up for their rewards program and get $25 off right away. Our waitress said no, we don't get $25 off today, we can get $25 off next time. Later, after we paid and left, we confirmed that's not correct. I noticed the reward card on our table evens states \"instant rewards: $25\". (See attached pic) We got cheated.   3. We didn't finish all of our food and we asked for boxes. One of the dish came with dipping sauces. We asked to box those as well. Usually any decent server would grab us new ones from the kitchen. Tonight our waitress decided to just give us empty sauce containers and let us take home the remaining tiny bit of sauces. (See pic) So little its pathetic.   So, there was no orderly seating, we got cheated out of $25, and our waitress was too cheap to give us a couple of dipping sauces. I left very unhappy tonight.",

For appetizer we had the ahi poke tuna which came with taro chips. The chips were so good but I wish there were a few more. The poke was fresh and sweet. Super tasty. I ordered the bbq bison burger and I ate it all. The sauce wasn't over powering so you could still taste the lean meat and the char on the burger. I am giving Public School an A+!",

I remembered all of the reviews mentioning the crispy cauliflower and I decided that I had to try it. I came for HH and was seated at the bar. Although alone, the bartender was pleasant and was chatty without being intrusive. I liked that. I had the HH portion of the cauliflower ($5) and the tuna tacos($7.) I also had an incredible beer, 2 Stone 's \"Sorry Not Sorry\" that was suggested by the bartender. Honestly, I'm not a drinker, as Yelpers at events can attest to, but this beer was fantastic (as it should be for $8.)   The second time I went, a few days later, I again had to have the crispy cauliflower. The regular portion is much larger than the HH size, so the price is fair. Brian P. and I also ordered the mashed potatoes (just as a snack, not a full meal) and the potatoes were taking a really long time to come out to us. When we mentioned to our waitress that we still hadn't received the potatoes, she went to check for us in the kitchen. The kitchen told her that they were already aware that we hadn't received our potatoes, as they had made them already but they weren't up to par. Because of this snafu, the cook was remaking our order and without us even asking, she told us that we wouldn't be billed for the potatoes. That's good customer service. Thankfully, the potatoes were piping hot and delicious.   While my only gripe is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a casual bar type place, in general, I really enjoyed PBS. I love the theme, the food and the service. I will be back!",

We came during \"recess\" and snagged a couple of discounted options. One of which was a dish called \"PB&J burger bites\" - I knew what to expect. Greasy peanutbuttery fatty deliciousness. Which was exactly what I got. I did however feel as though the jelly was slacking. GIVE ME MORE!  Side note, I think the description should mention that they AREN'T BITES... but an entire burger cut into quarters. I was definitely expecting sliders lol  The best part about this place was that it was open Easter Sunday. Yay!  Service was great, people were kind. There's nothing worse than bad service- but that is not issue here.",

When she finally came by it was just to say \"I'll be right with you\" and then she proceeded to pick up dishes from empty tables and talk to the table next to us about desert. She finally came back and took our order and our appetizer came out shortly after but it was cold. The food was just average. Our water glasses also stayed empty the whole time we were there and not once did we get offered a refill. We noticed that every other table actually had a water carafe to refill their own glasses but we did not. We definitely won't be returning here, a friend highly recommended this place so I had way higher expectations and they were not fulfilled at all. I can honestly say the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the view from the outdoor seating",

The guy holding the door open for us was dressed pretty casually. I didn't really know he worked there, but he ended up seating us. We were presented a drink and food menu. Their selection of beers weren't vast, but with what they had, they seemed real delicious. I personally got a Nitro beer and ordered the crispy buffalo cauliflower and speck & eggs as appetizers. As entrees, my friend and I ordered a shorty bowl and a moody burger.   The appetizers came out first. The crispy buffalo cauliflower came out in a good amount, and was indeed crispy. They had a little bit of cheese between the breading and cauliflower. The speck & eggs, although good, only had 4 halves bought out to us. When the entrees came out, I was really excited for the burger that came with a quinoa salad and the shorty bowl. The burger was really juicy and I couldn't get enough of it. The shorty bowl had some real delicious potatoes on the bottom of the bowl with the short ribs and other add-ins.   Our service was up to par. Our waitress checked up on us periodically, which was greatly appreciated. The food was good overall, but just a bit pricey. With all 6 of our items, it was near $80. Although good, I would rather not spend that much on two people regularly.",

And the which comes first burger, also too salty. I was very excited to order the impossible burger because the handful of times ive ordered at other establishments ive been very impressed... this one seemed chewy or overcooked and painfully salty. I almost sent it back, i wish i had. I do love the school theme and ambiance so i may still go back, but maybe only for happy hour.",

You get 4 rounds for $15 but I feel like every time I come here, they're always short staffed so you are probably always going to be waiting for something.   Besides that, the buffalo cauliflower is a must have, love their \"naked wings\", the chorizo mac and cheese is a must and the potato nuggets with cheese and bacon are whatever. I always feel like I'm ordering a bunch of small plates here and I'm always satisfied. I never catch myself ordering actual entrees, even for brunch, but some of it looks really good.   I give our waitress credit for hooking it up with an extra round of mimosas while we waited for our friend to finish her last drink so I'm giving this an extra star, but truly, it was more of a 3-3.5 star kind of rating. Unfortunately, the service has been consistent with every visit whether it be they're short staffed or whatever it may be.   I'll still be back and still enjoy brunch and happy hour here but will still hope for one day to have more speedy and better service.",

She had great feedback on the menu and was very attentive.   I started with the Crushed Velvet which is basically a lavender berry mule. This was one of the best drinks I've had in awhile, I loved it. The Cheddar Bacon Tots were our food starter. They had a great flavor and I loved the crispy outer layer. The sriracha ketchup really set off the flavors.   For dinner I enjoyed the CCB which was described as the chicken burger version of a Cobb salad. There were a lot of flavors that made this pretty good, but very messy. I'm not sure it was so mind blowing I'd order it again. My carrot slaw on the side had oddly few carrot shavings, but the flavor was okay. My husband had the Fried Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. He loved this unique combination.   I haven't had the opportunity to visit for Happy Hour, but the menu looks awesome. I'll definitely try to make a return visit to try Happy Hour.",

I told Jordan I did not like the salad due to the cilantro and she was so great about it, not only did she get me a new dish, she took it off our bill & gave us an appetizer card to come back for a free appetizer. Yes, I came back & brought 6 of my hubby's office staff, good move on their part giving the free appetizer card, that freebie which cost them... $7.? ended up being worth a table of 6 that spent over $400. Now that's good business. Make the customer happy & it'll pay back 100% in this case 400%!!!  This will be a regular spot for us for sure.",

We came on a Wednesday afternoon and the place literally had less than 10 customers, and no one ever came to take our food order.   We were intially seated and our drink orders were taken, then we did not even get a look in our direction from staff. After waiting 35 minutes for someone to come take our order we got up and left. Due to a terrible lack of service, I was unable to even try their food.",

    "text": "Went here to meet with a girlfriend for happy hour. The place looks really cool, very open and spacious. Great vibe. Not too loud. I found our table easily.          The patio was nice, I joined our group and after... A while, our server got my drink order. Eventually my drink came out. It was delightful, I think it was called a crushed velvet, it was refreshing and tasty and wonderful, served in a sweaty copper mug with lavender and blackberries it made me smile. I didn't meet the bar tender, but I know we would be the best of friends. Now I was ready for some food, it was happy hour so I chose their PB&J sliders. Tiny burgers with peanut butter and jelly and BACON?! Yes please. I waved down a server (not ours because I hadn't seen her in... Forever) and asked her if I could order something to eat. She hunted down our girl and she took my order. The sliders came out in a timely manner, and they were delightful. The bacon was thick and cooked to perfection, and just the right amount of peanut butter and jelly really made these juicy burger babies pop. It was close to time for me to head downstairs to see a movie so I put on my best \"check please\" face and looked around for our server who was once again gone forever. I flagged down another server and asked if I could get my check as the rest of the party was staying but I needed to head out, she found our server (from the abyss, I assume) and she brought me the check. As she handed it to me I said \"can you hang on one sec, I'll get you my card right now.\" And when I turned back around with my card and the bill, she was again gone. As it was now three minutes till I needed to be downstairs I went in and asked someone to run my check or find my girl. Which they did and I speed walked to the movie and was alright.             Even though our server was incredibly distracted and the other servers brought other tables food and drink to our table multiple times, and I heard everyone's tales of how this is the standard for their service, I'll still try it again. The food and drinks were awesome, the service just wasn't there. It wasn't the end of the world, but it almost made me late to see magic mike.",

I ordered the chorizo and shrimp and it was delicious! Not too spicy but still had a light kick. My date got the bangers and mash and it didn't look too good but he liked it so that's all that mattered to me :)   The atmosphere is very great. It's kind of noisy, hip, modern, chill, etc. Everyone that works here is very friendly, young, and accommodating which I love!

My dad is a bit of a beer connoisseur so trying new beers along with some good food is right up his alley. The new beers were being launched at 7 so we got there early enough to enjoy happy hour, or \"recess\" as they call it.  Right off the bat I noticed they had a nice selection of craft beers and our server Jared was extremely knowledgable when my dad expressed his desire to try a new stout. We ordered so many different beers during happy hour and the left coast tasting that I don't remember what we got but everything was delicious!  Now for the food: We got the speck and eggs which is a deviled egg with prosciutto on it, the mezze plate which consisted of pita bread with hummus and baba ganoush for dipping, crispy buffalo cauliflower with franks hot sauce and bleu cheese for dipping, and sliders. For me the sliders weren't anything special but I enjoyed everything else that we got. My only gripe about the cauliflower is the dipping sauces. This place markets itself as a gastropub so it would have been nice to see a sauce they create themselves. Overall this place gets a thumbs up from this girl and I'll definitely be back!",

Nice decor though and cute keeping with the school theme. Ordered the crispy ahi tacos which could have used a bit more acid and a pinch of salt but overall tasty Bacon and cheddar tater tots were really tasty Buffalo cauliflower was good with one hitch.  On the larger pieces of cauliflower there was uncooked batter in the nooks and crannies.  A bit of a turn off. Fish and chips were tasty but really greasy as well.  My wife took all the cocktail napkins on the table to soak up the oil and they were all soaked.  I ordered the huntsman burger which our server recommended I order medium.  I opted for medium rare ( my personal preference).  Burger came out medium.  A bit disappointed but not a  deal killer.  Some minor hiccups and I will probably give them another shot but if it's still mediocre that may be the last time.  If a place bills itself as a gastropub I expect some innovative food.  Not the case today.  Time will tell.",

That's how great it tasted.  The wings are awesome as well.  This will definitely be our new favorite spot. Can't wait to go back.",

The food we ordered was wonderful. Our server was extremely attentive. Our food came out super quickly. I ordered a guavalajara cocktail and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. My only criticism of the whole experience was that the bar took FOREVER to get our drinks to us. However, our server ended up comping a glass of wine to make up for the wait so I can't be too annoyed. I will definitely be going back and recommending to friends.",

But I've gone there on three different occasions and have had rude, rude, rude extremely rude service. Not only by a server, but a bartender and a manager. I will definitely start logging names because as an employee in the service industry myself I can't believe how entitled the employees are when a customer isn't happy with their meal or is just asking questions. My fiance and myself had a manager laugh in our faces when we had a question regarding the menu and wanted the price to be adjusted based on how it was described. There really needs to be a little customer service training for all the employees and managers. Employees, guest and customers alike need to understand quality customer service comes from quality customers and severs. I hope sooner than later the quality of service changes because it's actually a great place in a great location especially to have such shitty service and managers!!!",

First of all, the interior is so neat. I love the play on the school theme. We made in time for happy hour (3:30-6:30). Our food was AMAZING. We had: Farro and Brussels Sprout salad, Crispy ahi tuna tacos, 2 carafes of the house white, the BBQ Bison burger (with fries, BBQ mustard, and sriracha ketchup), Deviled eggs, and the Nutella Cookie sandwich. All of which was amazing and reasonably priced. We will be back again for sure. Our server was Christina and she was AWESOME!! She took great care of us as did the other ladies who helped out.",

We were seated right away on the outside patio which is a cool area, but it took a solid 20 min before anyone even acknowledged us or took a drink order. And even then the person who took the order admitted she wasn't our server, but would get us started so we didn't have to wait any longer. Our actual server (Jaimie) didn't come over until the food was already delivered to the table. Its unfortunate because the food was amazing and the atmosphere is so cool, especially the patio area. Just wish the experience had been better. I work food and bev as well and don't get a lot of Sunday's off so I was really looking forward to this. My roommate and I were going to order shots, another round of drinks, and even a couple more apps, but she dropped off the check without even asking if there was anything more we needed. So we just finished our drinks and went elsewhere to make the most of our Sunday Funday. Would consider coming back again assuming maybe she was just having a bad day and next time maybe the experience would be better.",

From appetizers to the entries everything was room temperature to warm, like the food was made and sat around. Some of the dishes severely lacked basic seasoning in the form of salt and pepper, and chicken in the salad tasted like it was cooked(overcooked) the day before, then shredded for use the next day. Kids chicken finger was fried for longer than needed. We were seated near the kitchen and I could tell that there was no one in control of the food coming out of the kitchen, very undisciplined. Been there before and the food was much better months ago before the started changing some of the plating of the food. No complaints on the bar side or service side. They did recognize some of the faults of the kitchen and took it off our bill and gave us a dessert to share",

The fish was cooked really dark, but otherwise good.   It just seems like a poorly run establishment. For example:   1. Their chalkboard listed pineapple cider, but they were out of it.  Maybe update your board?  2. My friend asked for regular ketchup because the spicy ketchup is really spicy. I love spicy food, but it really was. Our server said she would check, but they might be out of regular ketchup. What? They had a thimble full, thank goodness.  3. My friend asked for a glass of ice, then asked again. It finally came.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I wanted to go someplace we hadn't been, somewhere nicer, and we walked out of Public School. It was a Saturday night at 8:30, maybe 15 other parties sat inside. I tried to order the Appleton Cider but she let me know they were completely out of all ciders. Okay, so I just got water to start. THEN we tried to order our entrees, I ordered Fish n Chips and she let me know they were out of Fish n Chips and 5 other menu items. Mind you, the menu isn't that big in the first place. My boyfriend wanted the Turkey Melt but they didn't have that either. So I said I didn't want to pay for the 1 beer my boyfriend had and the 1 appetizer we hadn't got and we walked out. What kind of restaurant is out of half their menu on a Saturday night?? Will not be back.",

    "text": "We were in downtown Summerlin looking for an informal inexpensive place to have dinner. We came across Public School 702 and felt that it would fit the bill.  Ambience: this is one huge restaurant. When you walk in, on the right is a fairly good-size bar. To the left has to be one of the biggest restaurants I've seen in a very long time. The noise level is quite High. If you find that kind of buzz to be high-energy and invigorating, eating indoors would be right for you. I don't. Fortunately it was a lovely night and we chose to eat on the patio. The patio is also huge. And it is very nicely laid out with many booths and several couches. Service: our server, Brandon, was at our table almost immediately after we sat down. A winning smile and a really Pleasant  attitude . Made us feel very comfortable immediately . We got there just two to three minutes before happy hour ended. He was able to rush our order in so that we made it under the wire. He also made a couple of recommendations. Overall, very high points for service. Food: we started the meal with white bean hummus. A small appetizer size portion on the happy hour menu for just $4. Absolutely delicious and just the right size to start the meal. My wife ordered the happy hour sliders. 3 small hamburgers cooked to perfection. She found them to be delicious. I had the Margarita Pizza. This was just ok. Value: outstanding Ambience on the patio ( would not have wanted to eat indoors due to the noise level) and excellent service with satisfying food at happy hour prices. Very good value - dinner for two for about 25 bucks",

Today I ordered the Grilled Watermelon & Tomato stack  with feta cheese, mint & basalmic glaze~ Beautifully presented (I posted a pic) and very delicious to my tastes. I am NOT a feta  however this feta was SOOO thinly sliced it complemented the watermelon perfectly & the addition of some nuts on the plate as a garnish supplied that needed crunch that would have been missing~     This is a casual spot with seating in & outdoors both are lovely ~ However I will warn you it is loud so IF your looking for quiet, this is NOT a good choice especially after 5 when the bar is filling up.

They went all out on the atmosphere; even the menus are composition notebooks. They have a nice menu with not too much selection or variety, and the price is on the pricier side. I came here with 10 of my friends on a Saturday for brunch and they do have a bottomless mimosa special for $10. I ordered eggs and grits, and the top of the dish was very good, but the grits were meh. It tasted kind of funny, so I didn't finish it. My friend's dishes seemed appetizing though. The servers were very kind and attentive and made sure we had refills. Overall I would give the theme, originality, and atmosphere 5 stars, but food and selection 3 stars.",

    "text": "This restaurant is very new. As a matter of fact I believe they opened two days ago. With that in mind I know it's a little early to be criticizing this restaurant.  When we got to the restaurant two girls battled over how to Seat us. Once we were seated we waited. We then continued to wait. We waited some more. My wife and I actually played a game where we would see how many waiters or waitresses would either pass by or look at us directly.  After about 10 minutes of just sitting there I told my wife if one more waiter walks by us we would leave. My wife was extremely embarrassed at this, but I had to put my foot down. Shortly after two waiters walked right past us as they talked to each other. We got up to walk out. As we walked out of the restaurant we both laughed. Not only did nobody notice we were leaving, but the greeter who had just seated us actually said thank you have a nice day. I know that this restaurant is fairly new so I won't talk about the food or drink. Oh yeah, we never got to that point. Not sure if we would ever go back to this place. It's just a weird situation to be honest. Doesn't the restaurant want to serve food and drink to its customers? Apparently not for public school (702).",

The wait was 45 min and there was a long line of people. So I thought, \"ok,status quo it's a new restaurant\" BUT, most of employees are temporary transplants from other public school restaurants. I manage to get a crush velvet & a bourbon of some sort at the bar from the bar manager as the bar is inhabited by couch potatoes nursing their draft beers. I noticed several group of people leave the line and I am now close enough to see there are empty booths in the bar section, empty tables, empty communal tables large enough to seat a party of 5, ( we are 2). I walk up to the menu management gal at the podium and asked if we could sit at the communal tables and I was told, \"you need a reservation to be seated.\" I think to myself, \"I NEED A RESERVATION TO SIT IN THE BAR AT A COMMUNAL TABLE?\" Why? I quickly scan the dining room on the other side and there are serval tables(besides the booths & tables in the bar) that are EMPTY!i I say to the menu management gal, \" I need a reservation to sit in the bar?\" Since when? Other Public school restaurants allow walk up sit down at the communal tables. Doesn't that defeat the concept of COMMUNAL? The best part was when a gal, I'll just call her \"in charge\" asked if I'd like to \" sit out side...... \"....In 110 degree heat?  Really? Now why would she offer outside when there are several available tables in EVERY SECTION OF THAT HUGE  restaurant. If this new restaurant is trying to create the allure of something out of the velvet rope days of Studio 54 they are missing the mark! You are located in a brand new mall with many trendy restaurants. People can easily go elsewhere and will......and I did.  GRADE: FAIL!",

We ordered a bunch of apps and all split them. The bacon tatortots were great really crispy and still softer potato center great onion bacon flavor we also had the truffle fries they were the shoe string type great flavor also delicious we got the sliders and a margarita pizza the sliders were really tasty classic slider nothing fancy but they nailed it and the pizza was good too simple fresh ingredients . The bartenders here are real deal they have great drinks and I should have know from the in house made tonic that they could make just about anything . My wife knowing that I am a fan of the classic cocktail the Negroni asked our bartender if she could make one and without hesitation she said sure and it was great ! And topped with a dried cherry garnish !",

Music outside, not too loud which is the only nice thingabout it; DJ'S suck...choice of music is terrible.The booths outside attract the bugs due to hanging lights above table, really nasty, would never eat outside at night or evensit at a booth with a beer. They need to figure that bug issue out big time. With that being said, I would go back for the mushroom pizza all day long, really good pizza, and will just expect bad bar service, and eat inside.",

My wife had the crushed velvet drink and loved it.  The reason I only gave them 3 stars was due to the beer. They have a good selection but ran out of two of their Wheat beers.  I tried 3 others. They were all very hop heavy in taste.  The first one was a witber, which should be smooth but had a strong after taste. I drank about half and told the server it was very hoppy and asked if they had anything smoother.  He brought me another brand. Not as hoppy but still had a stronger taste.  Not comparable to the brand I described to him. I was able to finish it. I tried one more brand but still had a strong finish.  My guess is the brands they were out of were the ones that were less harsh.  The server didn't seem very knowledgable about the brands that they serve. If you like IPA's this is your place.  If you like beer like Smithwicks, Newcastle, Leinenkugel, Stella and smoother domestics, I would not recommend going here for a beer.  Great vibe though. We will go back if friends pick the place. Don't see us choosing this as our DTS spot.",

I decided to give them a second chance and went in last night for industry night at around 9 o'clock. We sat in the bar area and I had high hopes because they were NOT busy. I saw at least 3 waiters walk past our table with no acknowledgement towards us. After waiting 20 minutes with no one coming by to take our order we left.

The chicken and waffles was very flavorful, a hint of spice and the \"sweet gravy\" is a unique touch. I have tried a few different meals here and everything has been impressive.

Who thought it was a good idea to pack the burger and coleslaw into the same container? First of all, the burger was squished to be able to close it.

The favors all meshed together very well and the meat was cooked perfectly. It also came with a side of tasty French fries and siracha ketchup. Yum!  I thought this place was pretty good!

Dressing was pure mayonnaise. Actually no chicken at all or onion or cheese. Lettuce and quinoa with mayo. Service was extremely underwhelming as well. We are nothing at the table and paid over $60.

The decor is clever, and the overall restaurant is clean. The support staff is nice and they do try to do their best. After getting seated, it took a solid 7-10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and asked us for drinks. After that, it took 15-18 minutes before we had our drinks (water came after about 8 minutes). Then another 10 to take our order. Once we ordered, our appetizer took 15 minutes and our food took closer to 25, and my Dad's pizza took another 10 after that!  The food was solid although I wish there were more choices. I visit LV/Henderson/Summerlin area frequently and will try them again. I would suggest working on speeding up the kitchen and the attentiveness of the staff. Other than that, we had a decent experience.",

    "text": "It was pretty underwhelming on my first visit. Again, I usually don't write a review after 1 visit.. but we were pretty unhappy when we left.   It started with arriving at 10 pm after being told that the menu goes until 1 am. Not so.. late night menu started at 10 pm appearantly. There was a pretty mediocre selection of food at that point, but we figured we drove all the way out there so we would give it a try. This was after we were given the full menu. But here's how it all went..   We ordered drinks and found seats at the bar. Sat in front of a bartender that cleaned her well for literally 15 minutes without even looking up. Like, literally a foot from my face. Nothin. So my friend says, \"what time do you close?\"   She says - \"it's different every day,\" and she went back to cleaning. My other buddy says, \"but we can still order food right?\" She says nothing, hands us late night menus, and a full menu and continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. So we waited patiently as she polished the grate for the well, wiped it down and then walked away. it was bewildering.   My buddy had to ask another bartender that was passing by if we could order. The bartender said, \"well what time is it?\"   LOL! I said i's about 1030.. he said \"ooooh let me check...\" he says.   He gave us a thumbs up from the other end of the bar but did not return to take the order. So when he came to our end of the bar again - about 5 minutes later to pour a draft beer, my buddy just started ordering out loud. haha.. I mean we had no intention of being rude.. but we were trying way too hard to order, like no-one was interested in serving us. We all had all worked and were there to eat. Very hungry. There were 3 bartenders, and literally 9 people at the bar.. we were the only ones trying to eat, and just could not get service.   So now I'm watching the original female bartender that was cleaning her bar well in front of us. She grabs a glass water bottle.. drinks from it, then grabs a bottle of what appeared to be lemon juice from the bar well - and we all watched as she poured lemon juice into her water bottle. She did this by touching the mouth of the lemon juice bottle to the mouth of the bottle she just drank from, then put the juice bottle back in the well. I'm in no way squeemish, though that's just kind of gross, not to mention just wrong.   So far - wtf.   So the food.. we finally had a chance to order and were told only the late night menu was available.. after all that  time..we made some decisions and were informed we couldn't order them. This is were an explanation when dropping the menus would have been helpful.   So we ordered Calamari, flavor was ok, not crispy AT ALL despite being fried.. I mean, literally soggy. Naked wings, all flats, no drums, which was weird but they were crispy and good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but the presentation were those of eggs that had been prepared and set out for a few minutes because the yolks were not looking so fresh, also we ordered truffle fries. The fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke-warm, soggy, and served with preserved lemon aioli? I didn't understand that, I liked the aioli but not with these fries (that's just me).. They did not get eaten, yet taken away by the bartender without question as to whether we were done or if there was some reason it was over 75% unfinished. So there's that.  Still very hungry we decided on the FIG and Prosciutto Pizza and Taleggio and Mushroom pizza. I'm not even going to go into it becuase both were very sloppy in presentation and just mediocre in flavor overall. Honestly. We ate most of the Fig and Prosciutto and less than half of the Mushroom Taleggio.   What I will say about he pizzas -  is that the female food runner that brought the food over, literally shoved my drink to the side as I was trying to move the dirty plates from the previous course out of the way, then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto the bar and walked away. I spun around like.. wtf? my buddies both just laughed because we were so just over it at this point. She looked miserable, and was taking it out on us! haha.. it's laughable in retrospect, but I mean really?! She then walked to the end of the bar by the service well and started chewing on her finger nails. No Joke.   Ok, so listen.. I am not trying to just be an angry diner about this.. but i'll say it again: There is absolutely no reason for medocire food, or service in a town like Las Vegas. There are too many choices where people actually want to do the right thing, and serve a quality product.  This experience was a fail, and we are all easy-going foodie kind of people.   I have no intention to go back to PUBLIC SCHOOL 702, soley based on the service. I would have liked to try the regular menu, but this experience was just a bust for me.   Sorry -   Happy Eating to you though!",

When the waiter came to take my order, I said I'd not be eating since there isn't a vegan option and he said he'd see if he could fix that. The chef made a wonderful poached pear salad with arugula and candied pecans. Then, for desert, I was completely surprised to be delivered a lovely poached pear sort of taco with fried pastry dough as the shell and chocolate and powdered sugar. It was my first time having pears and it was absolutely delicious. I really appreciate them going to far to accommodate my dietary preferences and not just for the entree, but dessert - it was really sweet of them, and they are lucky to have such a stellar chef! Many places are nice and modify what they can to make recipe's vegan, but pretty much none make a vegan dessert.  My coworkers really all loved their meals, especially the buffalo cauliflower. Give this place a shot! The atmosphere, staff, and food are wonderful.",

This was the third time I've ordered it. When I arrived, it was nowhere near medium rare, closer to well done. I thought, well some siracha ketchup and it should be fine, as long as it still tastes good. Second bite, charcoal. I inspected it, totally burnt on the outside and even the cheese on top had burn spots! This was seriously the first time I've sent food back. The waitress was very sweet and apologetic, said they cook me another one right away. 10 min later the second burger shows up. Still not medium rare, but at least it wasn't burnt. I didn't want to wait another 10-15 min to start eating. So I finished my burger, paid, and left. To their credit, they did take the burger on the check. But I'd rather pay for the delicious burger I came for than the meh one I got for free.   Was really bummed as I have started to love this place. Will still try again, but definitely not making a trip for it.",

In short, our whole 2 hour experience can be summed up as: really really hot outside seating, poor service, and mediocre food :(   --  The happy hour is only available in the bar area or on half of the outside patio. Considering this is LAS VEGAS, if you're opening up happy hour on the outside patio, I'd hope you could spare some misters or working fans for the area.....or not. I guess we can just sweat it out/ overheat  -___-;;  Fine, if you're not providing us any cooling methods, at least make sure we have enough water? Is that too much to ask? Yes, it absolutely is. We had to flag down our waitress multiple times to get water.   Not to mention, our waitress was not so coordinated - would drop items almost onto us.   Finally, the food was really not that great.

    "text": "Update: I'm sad so say that I was extremely underwhelmed. Not by the quality of the food but the quality of the customer service. I have been here multiple times with my boyfriend and decided to bring my best friend here to try it.   First, the hostess. She was opening the door for some middle aged women ahead of us. She continued to hold the door for my party of three but then stated,\" how can I help you?\". I really wanted to respond with \"well, this is a restaurant soooooo.....\" But I decided not to and told her how many where in our party. She then said she had to help the people ahead and would be with us in a minute. When it was our turn she asked if we wanted to bar or dining area. I chose bar because I knew it was going to be the tail end of happy hour and we would be able to throw our order in quick before it was over. The hostess said \"sure, go on ahead\". So I say myself. I honestly couldn't tell you if she actually walked behind us or how the menus got on the table. I just know I turned around and menus were there but the hostess was gone. We never received the usual \"your server will be with you in a minute\". This is where the next thing comes in.   Second, the server. I have family that is servers and they immediately greet people that come to their table within 1 minute. I had sat at the table, my boyfriend went to the bathroom and returned and I still sat there and waited. It got to the point where I was actually looking around wondering when I was going to see who the server was. Kaila finally came to the table with waters, never said her name. Just asked if we wanted anything to drink or appetizers and if we had been there before. I told her two of us had and it was my friends first time. I asked her if they still had Happy Hour going on and she said \"no, it's 3:30 to 6:30\" and then asked my friend what time it was. My friend looked at her phone and went \"it's 6:30 on the dot.\" And Kaila went \"oh yeah you missed it\". I can honestly say this was the first time I had been somewhere where it was close to happy hour and the server didn't offer to \"hurry and rush the order in\" so that we would still get the happy hour specials. Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't been waiting for our server to greet us, we would have made it in time for Happy Hour. We all ordered our drinks and as I was going to order appetizer she walked away. When she returned with our beers. She had poured my boyfriends but gave me the bottle of Delirium and an empty glass and said \"in case you want a glass.\" I know that may seem minor but usually servers ask if you want in poured in a glass and this was the very first time I had ever not had delirium poured in a glass and served in a bottle. I'm not fancy or stuck up, but come on. Next we ordered our appetizers. We got three different items and no plates. We literally sat there for 5 minutes waiting for plates. After maybe 15 minutes the Kaila came over and asked if we wanted anything else or not. I told here we were going to get some entrees in a bit. She said okay and left. She came later and took our dinner orders and seemed more pleasant. I'm fairly certain it was only because she saw me checking in on YELP.   We were so disappointed with the service that we don't think we will be back. Which is disappointing, we really liked it. I'm not sure if because we were dressed casual and not all dolled up like the Summerlin housewives of hipsters out on dates they thought we were cheap or what. But we all make a very good living and have family that are servers so we always tip 20%, if not more and were repeat customers. But sadly I think that's changed.",

    "text": "Really, really cool spot!  I met a friend at Downtown Summerlin since she hadn't been there.  We decided it was way too hot to hang out outside.  The mall was completely dead and we quickly realized everyone was in this restaurant!  It was happy hour time, but I had my 3-year-old with me so we couldn't order off of that menu since HH is only for the bar, obviously.  Buffalo cauliflower: yum!  I normally hate mayo-based sauces, but this had so much blue cheese in it that I kept dunking.  Grilled watermelon & tomato salad (more like a stack):  my favorite thing.  Very refreshing and flavorful with some sort of white cheese (it looked in the shape of white chocolate shavings...tasted like feta sort of, but can't confirm because the shape of the cheese shards confused me but they were good).  Plus balsamic and oil drizzle.  Loved this!  Chicken & waffles:  the waffle is chile cornbread!  Very yummy.  It said there was syrup on it, but I couldn't tell because the chicken was saucy and the cornbread was savory.  It was good, but I felt it needed more sweet syrup to give it a True chicken & waffles experience.  We almost got the fish & chips, but decided against it because my kid wanted it and it was on the kids menu.  We thought we could just try a bite of hers.  When the kids' meal came out, it was a ridiculously large bowl of fries, with 3 small pieces of the best fried cod I have ever had.  The texture of the coating was insane, and the inside fish was still perfectly cooked (I hate when it dries out and is over cooked).  We took one of my daughter's pieces and my daughter ate the other two.  She hardly ate any fries.  Then, she wanted more fish.  GREAT.  It was $8 for her meal, and I had to order more fish for her...but this time I said no fries regardless that I had to pay $8 again because it was just a waste!    Other than being annoyed at spending $16 for my daughter to have enough fish & chips (our fault for taking one of her pieces), everything was great.  Very filling, indulgent meal.  Not expensive either.  Oh, and the service is great!  At least our experience.  Our server was a tad slow but it was busy in there so he had a bunch of tables I'm sure.  But even the servers who weren't ours were super friendly!  My daughter kept playing peek-a-boo with them since we were near the order-entry computer station, and every single one of the servers gave her attention and talked to her.  Very cool, I was impressed.",

My only (very small) issue was that our server (who was extremely nice) was taking care of almost all of the tables on our area. I counted at least 6. I have never worked in a restaurant so I am not sure if this is normal or not, but two of those six tables were of parties larger than 10. She was doing the best she could but it obviously took her a while to check on us and to take our entree order after we ordered our appetizers. Other then that amazing experience and would definitely go again, just maybe on a slower night.",

However myself and some friends went for brunch and we left disappointed. One of the chickens in the chicken and waffle plate on the brunch menu was soggy and undercooked. The manager did come to the table to apologize and gave us a coupon for next time which I thought he handled the situation well. Also the French toast was cold when it arrived to the table. I'd recommend this place as a great spot to grab some drinks but not a meal.",

The happy hour special is great for apps and drinks. The cauliflower was tasty and would perfect as a shared app before a meal. Asian salad was good with shrimp and chicken- had fresh flavors with mango and mint. Great healthy option, but not what you want if you want a really really yummy entree. I was told by a regular to order their pizza next trip in. Great vibe for casual date or hanging out with friends!",

After waiting almost 45 minutes and still not even receiving our drinks, we spoke to our server about the wait. He then said, clearly annoyed, that he had too many tables to wait on, pointing out each table and how he had no help. No apology for the wait, just excuses. We told him that while it was regrettable that they were understaffed, that was the responsibility of his management to deal with  ultimately not our problem. He responded \"well, it's not my problem if things are a little slower than you'd like them to be.\"  At this point we were done. We asked to speak to the manager and waited for him for ANOTHER 15 minutes before walking out. He never appeared.   There are too many other options in the area for anyone to have to put up with such abysmal service.",

My sister came to visit and we were on the hunt for food and drinks with a cool environment. My sister came across Public School, i mentioned to her I knew of it but had never been. We got here at about 8:45p with closing approaching at 10p. We were seated right away by the hostess. Our Server Aurelia took care of us, gave us enough time to look over the drink order. We ordered the Rose to drink, Brussels, cauliflower bites, and poblano with quinoa and so much other good stuff to share. Everything was HOT, FRESH, and so delicious. They also were accommodating with adjusting our order to vegan friendly! Which can get complicated for my sister and I but it was no problem here. Aurelia checked on us and she was awesome, and friendly! Also ordered the chicken sandwich Togo, she gave me all the sauces I asked for on the side and nothing was missed. Toward the end of our meal we had a visit from the GM, Kevin. He was very kind and welcomed us to Public School! Not only will I be back with other friends but I know my sister and I will return together. Thank you Aurelia and Kevin! See you soon :)",

    "text": "First timers today at PS 702! The food was delicious! Great ambiance and very clean restaurant. We started with the speck and eggs and the bacon cheddar tots with sriracha ketchup. Both were good. The speck and eggs didn't have a lot of flavor so I found myself dipping a lot. Then we moved on to lunch I got the green chili soup of the day it was amazing a little spicy but we'll made. My husband got the American burger which does not come with cheese heads up! An American burger with no cheese WHAT!?!? So he added American cheese go figure :) my sons shared a kids cheese pizza and let me tell you it was huge. So parents if you want to save a little money since the restaurant is pricey order 1 kids cheese pizza for all the kids it really is that big!!!    I gave a 4 star review instead of a 5 for a couple of reasons. One my husband is a soda drinker and it is not complimentary refills! He was not happy about that! They only have bottled soda! That just isn't right especially when they do have spicy foods! The second reason I took away a star is because the food took a while to come out and I mean 30 minutes! For a medium cooked burger, cheese pizza, and a cup of premade chili to take 30 minutes is just ridiculous. I feel like there is no excuse for that especially on a saturday for brunch when they should be properly staffed. Other then that the restaurant was great and our server was pleasant. We will be back my husband fell in love with the burger and skinny fries!   Little tip for all you craft beer lovers they have an epic list!",

From first experience the food isn't as great and the price does not fit the quality for most dishes. However the truffled steak and macaroni was a big hit to me and felt that, that was the only reason to come. The server (at the time) was a big sweetheart and was another reason why I wanted to share this restaurant with personal friends and family.  Well today was my mother's birthday. Knowing that their steak was great I was excited to bring her in for a try since she's already tried several yummy steakhouses (Fogo de Chao just below) plus and overall presentation of the restaurant is extremely creative! Which is the ONLY reason why I would give this place a star.   I proceed in, and a woman with red hair who kind of reminded me of Ronald McDonald quickly frowns from her fake smile once we turn in. Ultimately I ignored it and didn't care to let one gesture ruin our night. I proceed to say \"2 for balcony please.\" She leads us in right away and offers us any seat in the house and will aware the servers that we are here.  10 minutes later, not one server came. At this point I was losing patience. Several server goes by and not one acknowledges us. I had enough time to have a conversation to reserve a dinner at fogo de chau and ultimately ashamed that I brought my mother in here. Being the sweet woman she was, she agreed that we should just leave. Not only did this place ruin a birthday dinner but was rude in every single way. Will not becoming here any longer.   On side note: maybe if she apologized when she clearly saw us leaving, I might have reconsidered the whole situation but she instead rudely smirked as we left.",

I walked in at 5:35 and it was far from being busy. In fact, eight guests at the bar, at best. The tables had all of 10 guests spread out. The ratio of staff to guests was about equal. At 5:52, I realized I was invisible. Not one server acknowledged me and I was seated right smack in the middle of the entire common area, centered on the tv screen. As I walked out, the hostess (brilliant in her intuition -- not!) said, \"Would you like me to get you a server?\" I was speechless. Well isn't that the point!!??!!",

    "text": "I stopped by with my cute little girlfriend Kim because she was being a hungry little baby, and it was beyond my expectation.  The business gave off a similar vibe as other public house themed pub/bar but had better tasting food, better quality cocktails, and more interesting theme than the others.  I expected something like Yardbird, but it was much better.  And the bartender, Kallie, was proficient in her mixology. Well done. I would definitely come back next time I'm in the mall.   If there was something that bothered me, it was the fact that they had on a TV channel on surgeries, the nasty kind. Puss popping and liposuction. Disgusting choice for a place that serves food.  My little baby had to run away to the bathroom while all patrons were screaming.  I gave four stars as Kim said it was \"unforgiving\" for a restaurant to make such mistakes. I would change the review if no such thing occurs next time.",

    "text": "First time today and it went very well! Went around 230, wasn't busy, so we got seated quickly. Unfortunately we were too early for RECESS (love that)/happy hour.  Interior: very cute motif, loved the menu!   Waiter: didn't catch his name but he had a ponytail and glasses, haha, but he was awesome!  One thing though, although I LOVE the ketchup and sriracha dip that came with my food, he should have asked if I wanted regular ketchup or the ketchup & siracha, you know, just in case ppl wouldn't like the combination (but I mean... It's siracha! Jk... Maybe that's why he didn't ask..who'd reject such a thing!?)   When I told him he should hook it up on more sauce, he did AND suggested a bbq mustard sauce that would go with my food but I thought it tasted better with my brother's pizza, but I appreciated his incentive.  Food: I got the Colorado Lamb Burger medium rare, omg. It melted in mouth. I thought it was delicious! Loved the savory from the lamb and the sweetness from the jam together.   My brother got the pizza which I thought was okay.   A friend got tortilla soup and sliders, didn't get to try the sliders but it looked dry and she said it was ok. I got a taste of the tortilla soup and the flavor was light where I've had tortilla soup blasting with flavors, I mean, it wasn't bad, but just not what I'm used to?   Pro: They have dishes with kale, quino, and cauliflower, and other things if you're feeling something more healthier? I 'preciate that too :).  + they have a children's menu  Con: I kind of wish there were more selections for nonalcoholic drinks though, but I understand that it's more of a pub kind of thing, but I was craving strawberry lemonade or other fruity, carbonated drinks. I mean, since they do serve burgers, maybe shakes? Haha.",

Pros: 1) Not too busy (Tuesday evening) we sat at the bar. 2) Happy hour from 3:30-6:30 Aka Recess 3) $10 half-liter of house wine and $7.00 Margherita pizza! 4) Service was quick and friendly. They wernt pushing us out after we finished, even though we were there for a good while. 5) Music wasn't too loud...easy to have a conversation.    Cons: 1) Pizza was pretty greasy. It pooled on top. (Was still pretty good!) 2) No ranch available! My friend asked for some and they said they do not have ranch. Who can eat pizza without ranch? They gave her blue cheese instead.",

    "text": "Stumbled across the awesome spot while wandering downtown Summerlin. Even though they were busy they sat us quickly. Our server Melissa was great. Never ran out of water, checked in on us in reasonable intervals without being bothersome. Everyone was friendly and seemed to be enjoying where they worked.   I ordered the flat steak with the chorizo Mac and cheese for my entree and we had the tater tots as an app. Those tots are feeling amazing. You will want to order more than just one order (it's seven in a single order, so if you don't want to end up in a fork war or having that awkward moment when there is only one left...) The steak was incredible. It came out exactly as I ordered it and no steak knife was necessary (which is an amazing accomplishment for the cooks, as flat iron steaks can be very tough.) There was just the right amount of truffle butter on top and just delicious. The mac was also very yummy. So much so that my mum decided she would just eat mine.   Now for dessert! If you are a bacon lover, and who isn't? You need to order the Cookie ice cream sandwich! Right now! It is epic. I mean... Nutella spread, chocolate chip cookies, vanilla ice cream encrusted with BACON! and 6 bucks!   I will definitely be returning when I'm back in Vegas.",

    "text": "Public school indeed with cafeteria like food.  This review is being written by a person who comes from a food and beverage background.   Pros: The restuarant is aesthetically pleasing. We were seated promptly and the hostess was friendly.   Cons: We went there last night for dinner and while it was crowded we couldn't understand why. Our server was unbelievably rude. I wish I had gotten her name but she never introduced herself. She seemed fine at first but we managed to get on her bad side. She served us luke warm water (I'm not sure if that's their thing but I prefer my water cold). I asked her for cold water and she seemed irritated - but I thought maybe I was reading her wrong so brushed that off. We ordered food. Appetizers were calamari and wings. My father got the steak tacos, my boyfriend got the bison burger (medium rare), and I ordered the fish and chips. The apps were okay probably the best part of the meal. My fish was overcooked in old oil and the fries tasted frozen. We told the server that the quality of the fish wasn't good because of the old oil and her response was \"is that not okay\". Uh No? Im paying for quality food right? I asked her to take it back and if it's possible to get another item on the menu (steak tacos). The tacos were mediocre. The tortilla tasted old but the steak was cooked well. Now on to the burger. It was well done. When the server came by to ask how everything was, we stated that the burger was well done, not medium rare. I supposed she just took that as a statement because she didn't care to do anything about it or apologize. So now it's the end of the meal, the manager comes over to apologize for the fish and chips. We explained what was wrong and her excuse was that they didn't have an executive chef or su chef in the back, therefore the food isn't consistent. Did she really just throw her restuarant under the bus? Okay lol. The bill came out to be a $100 and some change for 2 apps, 3 entrees, and 4 beers. Not too bad but not worth the quality to be honest. The service was slow and she gave an attitude at every request. We were originally going to give her 15% tip even with the bad experience (because hey, she didn't cook the food) but changed it to 10% when she gave us a dirty look and scofted as we left. Terrible experience. Train your servers over customer service. Get someone to expedite the food. Train your manager on how to pacify a complaint without throwing the restuarant under.   Would have been 1 star but I gave them 2 stars for the atmosphere, the apps and the friendly hostess.",

    "text": "I had trouble writing this review initially because I really wasn't sure whether to give it three or four stars. It's one of those that I really wish I could give a 3.5, but that doesn't exist. I really thought about it and food matters so I'm giving this a three unfortunately. I've been here many times. For happy hour, brunch, and dinner. Lately we stick to just going there for brunch for the almost thought of us. It's $10 for four drinks which include a bloody Mary, beermosa, mimosa, or Michelada. There are a few things to choose from on the brunch menu as far as food. I think we've tried just about everything. The last time  in particular we had the sausage and grits, the fried chicken and waffles, and the avocado hummus toast. The sausage and grits was actually quite good. I would give that a four out of five. The grits kind of come in a firm grit cake and it's covered and a sausage gravy that has bacon in it. Definitely something I would order again. The avocado toast was OK. It was avocado and edamame so it had a taste that I wasn't a huge fan of. But it was good for what it was and it came with two big slices bacon on top which made it better, because bacon makes everything better. Now for the chicken and waffles. It was recommended to us by the server. We wanted something a little bit sweet to go along with our savory dishes. Well this was not sweet. It was basically a savory waffle with corn that came with gravy instead of maple syrup and some fried chicken that was just average. I would give this dish at two or 2.5 at best. I definitely would not order this again. It is not sweet and savory if that's what you're looking for. I was just underwhelmed by the whole experience.   Bonus tip though: if you order the Bloody Mary first it comes with a chicken wing!",

That's about it the management there has no idea what they're doing their hosts and servers have no clue of what customer service is. We had made a reservation 48hrs prior to our actual dinner and made us wait 30 mins after our reservation set time because they were not prepared and setting it up when we got there. It was Saturday 6pm and the knights game was on so leaving to find another dinner spot for a big party wasn't an option unfortunately. Our server Brianna did not give us a worthwhile customer experience. Shenever had any sense of care for our service our food or our enjoyment at their venue. Every time she came around she would ask \"do you need anything\" in a attitude as if it was a chore to do her job. When she brought out the cake for our birthday girl no smile just dropped it off and left. If I could give her a tip it would be a smile goes a long way, and I know she has a great smile too because I could see it every time she was talking to her coworkers but I guess her coworker must tip her out because she had no care about my customer experience. Overall I will never have dinner there but I will come back to see the bartenders to watch the games and enjoy their customer service.",

    "text": "Got around to dropping in at Public School tonight after having been familiar with the dtla location (612). Casual ambiance and food; don't let the gastropub classifier deter you, this one is pretty family-friendly.  Ordered the Cutting Board and Fiery Calamari to start. The calamari couldn't quite live up to its name as the flavor of the shichimi was a bit shy, but otherwise, passably tasty. The Cutting Board had a fair selection of cured meats and cheeses (as well as Marcona almonds, caramelized onions, etc.) with toasts, large enough to share with 2 others.  For myself, I ordered the Huntsman burger, which was cooked to my liking and came with a generous thing of broccolini covered in an even more generous amount of padano.  The service was attentive even though the restaurant had started to fill up with the dinner crowd. No mark-ups for tardiness since the food arrived at the table in a timely manner.",

The entire experience was ridiculous. From the moment we walked in- cold stoic hosts to neglectful servers. I forgot about the food and drinks because I felt like an interruption rather than a paying guest in their establishment. The atmosphere was very dull and pretentious. It could have been leaps and bounds better but I'm never returning and will never recommend this establishment. Management needs to think about it's hiring process and establish better standards of guest service. Maybe then they could educate their target audience about \"food and beer\". I give this a couple of years tops. This place greatly reminds me of Rattlecan that used to be at the Venetian, great concept and great products but cold and unwelcoming staff and atmosphere. An epic fail and a waste of invenstor's money.",

I love to go to happy hour and have drinks and then order food towards the end. We did not even order food because the service was so dang slow that getting a drink was near to impossible. The female bartender at the bar, Courtney, told me she was going to charge my Bill. She did, and she never gave us the drinks we were charged for. The people on my right ordered an appetizer and they were incorrectly charged - they were charged higher than the pricing on the menu. When they said something to Courtney she said \"oh the menu prices have changed. \" so shouldn't that mean that the menu prices on the menu should have changed? The person on the left ordered something off the menu and Courtney said, \"we don't have that anymore.\" Didn't they just open? So how could you have something on the menu that they no longer even serve? How could there be three different sets of people sitting at the bar all given wrong prices and wrong orders!?. Happy hour beers are small. I can't comment on the food since we never ordered it because we knew it would take too long to get it. We went somewhere else to eat.  This place is never going to make it if they don't get their stuff together.",

My boyfriend got the bison burger once which he loved and got the salmon which was perfectly cooked.  We also had the buffalo cauliflower which fits great info my current cauliflower obsession.  My favorite thing, though, may be the Brussels sprout slaw.  I'm trying to recreate it at home so I can have it all the time.  The beer selection is awesome and fun.  The servers are ok but sometimes adapt the hipster attitudes on top of the dress code. This isn't Brooklyn; you can keep the clothes but lose the tude.  The biggest complaint... It's too frickin loud.  Not the music- it would be great if I could hear that better because they have a good playlist.  It's the crowd noise that is overbearing.  I hope they find a way to lower it but with the ceiling so high I doubt it's possible.  I'm sure it's nicer out on their huge patio.",

We sat in the communal dining area because there was a 45 minute wait for the private tables and the bar was full. Our waitress was very friendly however we were waiting on our drinks forever. I ordered a steak salad and our friends had a burger. The atmosphere was social but the music and the loudness of everyone's conversation was definitely clashing. Our friend's got their food about 5 minutes before us... I thought this was very unprofessional as we were telling our friends to go ahead and start eating and they felt awkward eating in front of us. We had ordered medium-well for both the burger and the steak salad and when we got our food, both cuts of meat were very pink. I almost sent my steak salad back but I knew it would take even longer to get it and we had already been waiting a while. The salad lacked flavor and I ended up asking for lemons and vinegar to season it myself. I would still go again here but I would choose something else on the menu and order well-done to avoid having an almost still mooing cow delivered on my plate.",

A different manager had attended to my party since the one I was speaking to was unavailable. She was very nice and made sure this time the service that was provided was not subpar.   I ordered the same  burger as last time which was the PB Burger. This time you could actually taste both the peanut butter and jelly and the burger was not dry.    Overall, this time around everything was great and service made up for the last time we came and dined here.",

While the others sat and waited.  My friend ordered the steak fries. Which came out with a side of fries and a steak. The steak was tender and flavorful. I ordered the street tacos more like 2 tapas. I also ordered the calamari it was delicious not fried too hard. For dessert we had a yummy brownie and the huge cookie sandwich. Overall the scenery is pretty chill and relaxing.

    "text": "This school-house themed restaurant in Downtown Summerlin is more than just the fun educational decor and menus that look like composition books- it has great food and wonderful service as well. I made a reservation for a friend's birthday, and they surprised us with a candlelit dessert at the end of our meal. I highly recommend the buffalo cauliflower and deviled eggs as appetizers, and the beet salad to get started. My dining companions enjoyed the fish and chips, and the prosciutto flatbread. Their posted special was, \"buy two drinks and pay for both\"- I appreciate whimsy. Great atmosphere, great service, great food.",

    "text": "This little joint did not disappoint!  I've always seen this restaurant when I would go to Summerlin but never got the chance to eat there.   We made reservations for a party of 10 at 730 pm on. Thursday night & It was not that busy.  Our server was the sweetest & she did great.    They do have happy hour with varying appetizer choices and drinks from 2pm-6pm.  I am really curious to try all the different appetizers next time.  I did feel like their drink menu was a bit small... they offer lots of beers, some wines, and I believe hard liquor as well.  I'm not much of a beer drinker so I was not interested.    Anyways, some of my friends and I decided to share a few plates.  We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza,  skirt steak tacos, PS burger, and the chicken and waffles.  The pizza was good! I did enjoy the crust because It was crisp and thin which wasn't too much.  The tacos were okay, not too special.  The ps burger was also good.  It's just a regular cheese burger, you can never go wrong.  I did enjoy their truffle fries! The aioli that came with It was so yummy I even dipped my burger into It.  The chicken and waffles were also good! I could not figure out the taste of It, It was a bit odd, but I enjoyed It.    My bill for the pizza was only $16 and the others are about $10-$15 also.  The prices are decent and the food quality is there.  I am definitely coming back some time!",

    "text": "We ordered the Bison Burger, Pig & Pineapple Pizza, and Nutella Cookie.   My son enjoyed his burger, and I had a bite of the meat portion and thought it was flavorful. We both thoroughly enjoyed the french fries and sriracha ketchup and I dislike most fries and never use ketchup.   I feel like my pizza should've been called P3(cubed) (pig, pineapple, & pepper) to keep up with the \"school\" theme and to match the flavor/ingredients. I'd say the pizza was ok. I had good bites, mediocre bites, overwhelming pepper bites (hence why I'd change the name), and many bites where I wondered if prosciutto had any flavor. The prosciutto was all in the middle and not spread around, and the pepper was cut in slices which made it easy to take off, but did not work well for getting all the flavors in every bite. Finally, the crust was soft.   The Nutella Cookie Sandwich was also ok. It wasn't too sweet, which I liked. It was however huge, so we ended up wasting half of the sandwich. The best bites I had were the ones with just cookie and Nutella because the cookie was so hard that biting into it with ice cream hurt my teeth. We pushed off the bigger pieces of the pecan bacon crust, to me the bacon flavor tasted more like bacon fat than bacon.   I liked the school theme throughout the restaurant   and I saw they had outdoor games. Food did not take long and staff was nice.",

Find parking wherever you can and walk through the shopping plaza up to the second floor.    $11 for a small dish of chorizo mac and cheese just seems a bit steep. We also got a salad and the fried cauilflower (tasty), but $30 a person (after tip) for those three things and a beer seemed kinda steep.  Things here aren't bad at all, just a wee bit too spendy, I think. The food was good but not memorable. Considering how there's a lot of competition around here, I probably would go check other places out before returning.",

There were only 2 bartenders. My first drink was made by the female...first one was pink, had squeezed lemon, frothy and thyme...the second time it was a different color pink, no froth, no thyme or lemon. When I asked for a new one I asked if the male made my second one and the waitress said yes...so I asked if the female could make it and I'd patiently wait for it. Matt got an old fashion, also made by the girl. His second one came back and it was a completely different color. Before the waitress sat it down she mentioned it looked different and it also didn't have the cherry in the second time around. In conclusion The food was great! The deviled eggs were amazing! I'd go back again!",

They were served in a small rocks glass. They were good though. I could tell they were made with fresh lime juice and not sour mix.  We were there during happy hour, so we ordered some apps from the happy hour menu.  $7 Ahi Poke - served with tortilla chips and covered in a sweet sauce. It was very good.  $5 Buffalo Cauliflower - this was excellent. Surprisingly very good. They fry cauliflower like chicken wings and serve it with hot sauce and ranch.  $4 White Bean Hummus - they serve it with grilled pita. I have had better hummus, but it was good. I really enjoyed the grilled pita.  $4 Quinoa Salad - it was very good. It reminded me of quinoa tabouli without the parsley.  The service was great and I really like how the dining area is set up with the patio and the bars. I will definitely be back for dinner. Their menu looks like a winner to me. If the apps are a preview of what lies ahead, then I think I will enjoy it.  I'll be back!",

The only con for the patio seating during brunch is the sun can shine directly at you but what can ya do?!   Our server was really sweet though it took her some time to get to our table... She answered all questions and gave us her recommendations. The food was just ok. We shared chicken and waffles and a healthy egg scramble. The chicken was bone in and the gravy was thick. The scramble had lots of veggies.   We also got the bottomless bubbles but their \"bottomless\" certainly has a bottom as it is 4 drinks per guest. You can get a carafe of mimosa and that constitutes as 3 drinks and then you can get a bloody. The Bloody Mary was way too thick and spicy. I wouldn't get it. It doesn't go down that well after eating and didn't satisfy my Bloody Mary craving. You can also get a bloody beer/Michelada.   We may be back for the outdoor seating. The prices are not that bad. BTW, love the school theme on the napkins and menus!  HOT TIP: Recess/Happy Hour at the bar. Mon-Fri 3:30-6:30. Discounts on brews, wines, & bites!",

    "text": "As the name suggests, a dining experience here is truly a public education in food. Almost everything on the menu has a culinary flair to it that's special and different than your typical, boring, stereotypical \"bar food.\" It's very obvious there's a dedicated and concerted effort to serve the highest caliber food possible, as you can taste the quality in each and every bite. That commitment probably increases their food costs, but the menu prices are still fair and reasonable, in my opinion. Even better, their customer service is just as good as the food.   On my recent visit, I called the chef out of the kitchen to give him my compliments. As you would expect, he was very grateful and appreciative. But whereas most chefs would probably just accept the compliment and move on, Chef Josh asked, \"Is there anything we can do better? Do you have any recommendations or suggestions for me or our staff? There's always room for improvement and we're always striving to do better.\"   The response in my head was, \"Wow. THAT is the type of commitment to excellence I want in a restaurant I visit.\" .... We talked for a few minutes before Josh had to head back to the kitchen, and I was extremely impressed with his \"people skills.\"   With food so great and customer service that goes above and beyond, I'll definitely be recommending this place to more and more people. I live about 25 minutes away, but \"Public School\" is definitely worth the drive.",

They have a nice selection of beers and will give you a small taste if you can't decide.  During brunch on Saturday they have $4 beers, making it even better!   I got the steak salad which was Delicious!  The steak was tender and cooked medium rare, the way I like it. The salad had both red and yellow beets, making it tasty and healthy.  It was so good, that I didn't realize until I ate it all, that the bacon was left off. I told our waitress and she was so nice about it and offered us a free dessert!  My son got a burger, which was huge and juicy. It came with fries, which were also delicious.  He said he would get it again.   We decided to try the ice cream sandwich made with chocolate chip cookies.  It was large enough for us to share.  It was yummy!  Then our nice waitress,  Katie, surprised us with the banana pudding in a jar. She said we had to try it and she was right. It is so smooth and creamy and made with vanilla wafers. May be the best banana pudding I ever had!  The place is clean and has plenty of seating both inside and out. I will sit outside next time when it's a bit warmer.  I love the menu that is made to look like an old composition notebook from the past. The decor is wonderful, with old Worldbook Encyclopedias on a huge bookcase.  There are more things on the menu that I would like to try and more beers to drink! I will be back!",

I finally got to see for myself how wonderful this restaurant is & what the hype was about. Me & my friends came in for dinner.   Atmosphere blew me away! Modern, clean, & dim. I didn't think the restaurant was that big. We were given 3 options to dine: bar, booth, or patio. We chose a booth, & I was surprised to see a wall outlet in our booth as well as 2 USB ports. The interior was amazing which made me reminisce about grade school. Booths were set up to look like study booths. Overhead, had models of planets, & there was a wall in front of us that had books. Our dinning area definitely reminded me of a library. & of course, they have free WiFi too. Behind me was the kitchen which looked like a school cafeteria. The menus were composition notebooks, & the check was on a mini clipboard. Napkins looked like binder paper notepads. I haven't checked what the bar looked like, but the patio gave a really nice view & you could play a couple games too like a giant connect four, beer pong, or sandbag toss.  Food was a little on the pricey side, but it's what you would expect from a fancy outlet mall like Downtown Summerlin. I ordered the Thai Shrimp Noodle Salad which was a pretty big portion. I took a bite & it immediately rushed throughout my mouth with flavor. I was impressed. My friend ordered the tacos. The meat in those tacos were also very flavorful. & my other friend ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich which he said was pretty good. The French fries were deliciously, & the ketchup had an interesting taste. A little spicy kinda like mixing ketchup with Sriracha. We got a ice cream cookie sandwich for dessert. It's surprisingly really big, & was able to satisfy the 3 of us. Cookies were soft with sweet chocolate chips in them. The vanilla ice cream prevented the chips from being too sweet. & the crunch on the outside added a nice texture. I liked the overall quality of the food, & it justified the price.   Staff service was excellent! It's not everyday you get greeted by the general manager which surprised me. I didn't get his name, but apparently, they have new management? I don't know how it was before compared to now, but I think it's great now! Our server was Lissie, & she's just adorable. Haha. Very nice & always had a sincere smile on her face. Very helpful & knowledgeable in explaining dishes & drinks as well as giving us recommendations. She even gave us an introduction to the restaurant!  It exceeded my expectations, & I'd be sure to come back again to try the rest of the delicious food. I'd definitely wanna come back for happy hour! That's for sure!",

    "text": "After about 20 visits to Public School I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants. I'd say only once have I been disappointed in something I've ordered. The atmosphere is casual but you'd feel comfortable in date wear or a casual day shopping wear. The theme inside is grade school stuff like gym floor panels, globes and math flash cards. I love the community style high top tables in the bar area and the USB ports found underneath the bar (*hint: the bar area is open seating if there is a wait to be seated). They have a great beer selection including a rotating tap list.   Let's talk food now, my tops picks that I order almost every time:  Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer is amazing! Its fried and tossed in buffalo sauce and served with blue cheese sauce.   Shrimp and Grits is everything sweet and salty with tender bacon, floating in a moat of savory gravy surrounding a brick or grits and topped with the juiciest pieces of shrimp and crisp corn!!!   Kale Cesar Salad w/ Pan Seared Salmon. The kale is shredded and massaged so it's really tender and easy to eat, tossed in Cesar dressing with shaves of parmesan cheese. Both the salmon and salad are very large portions as well.   Cheesy Tots are basically a loaded potato toppings rolled into a tater tot and fried to a crisp!  Brown Bag Fries... honestly they're just French fries in a bag and they're fantastic!",

Just as we began to eat our food, our server came to the table and informed us that the restaurant was out of orange juice. (This was maybe 10 minutes after we received our first mimosa, so they *had* to have known they were running out.) To make matters worse, the table next to us asked why they were out and were informed that the oj is fresh-squeezed...so someone was just too busy to squeeze.  Public school: don't offer mimosas on a Sunday if you can't deliver. Side note, food was delicious, server was pretty awful, but that could have been the circumstances.",

    "text": "My favorite dishes are the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower and Bacon Cheddar Tots. I have not made a visit without ordering both dishes to start the meal. The Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower ($7) is fried with a buffalo sauce batter; crispy and tender! It's perfectly served with blue cheese aioli and buffalo sauce. I would visit just for this dish! The Bacon Cheddar Tots ($7) are so great; I have to pace myself to make sure I don't devour it too quickly. I don't love the Sriracha Ketchup that accompanies the tots; the flavor is off and seems a bit too sweet. The tots don't need sauce anyway, but it also comes with their fries.  Chicken Sausage, Spinach & Goat Cheese Pizza ($15) with bechamel, roasted tomato, provolone, and chili flakes. I loved this combination of ingredients and it had such a great flavor, though I wish there was more tomato (it was pretty scarce). They also burned the pizza around the edges, so that was unpleasant. But otherwise, great pie.  I've had their Crispy Chicken Sandwich ($14) a couple times and have really enjoyed it. The chicken has a nice crisp and decently moist and I love the slaw. The thing that really puts it over the edge is the sauces; sweet carrot habanero aioli and mustard BBQ - fantastic! It's served with their Brown Paper Bag Fries. These are decent on the fry scale.  The only dish I haven't liked is their Bangers & Mash. Everything was so odd about it. The flavor of the sausages, the flavor of the mash.. it was not good. My friend and I couldn't take more than a couple bites before shoving it aside.  From brunch, I like the Chicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits ($13) and Eggs Benedict Pizza ($13). The grits are phenomenal and the overall dish just sings; highly recommended. The pizza is good, but needs a touch more prosciutto and hollandaise as it was a bit dry.  I don't always make it to dessert, but I'm really glad I was convinced to try the Nutella Cookie Sandwich ($7). The cookies were surprisingly chewy and oh my, it was heaven with the ice cream, bacon pecan brittle, and Nutella drizzle. You won't regret it.",

Next came the margherita pizza. As our waitress was setting it on the table I noticed a bug crawling on it. I pointed it out to her right away. She looked at it and was visibly shaken, and said out loud \"oh, no\"! She immediately took the pizza back to the kitchen.  Not really feeling like eating anything at this point we just asked for our bill. We only had the two appetizers. Next she came back with the manager who proceeded to blame the bug on the fact that they keep their doors open all night. I don't care if you are cooking in the middle of the jungle, food should not have bugs in it.  Although we had plan to pay our bill, it would have been nice to have been offered to offset the bill, or offer a complimentary dessert, or something. The manager acted as if we were trying to take a shot, or something. We just feel like this situation could have been handled differently.  Sadly, we will most likely never go back there. We really liked the vibe. I would have only given this place one star, however our waitress, Julianne was a sweetheart.",

The decor & the concept of the restaurant were both aligned very well as it made you feel like you were in school. My girl friends & I sat on the patio, it was lovely. The food was great & was brought out with little wait. I give it 4 stars because though the food & the restaurant was great, I feel that our server could have been better. She spoke really fast & was somewhat short with her answers. Didn't really smile at us which made it feel like she didn't really want to be there. Other than that, everything else was perfect.",

Later the DJ set up and played lots of great things even started karaoke at the crowds request.  FOOD: Summer succotash was amazing and came highly recommended by Jerrod S. (our very helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic server) I really enjoyed the Shrimp and Grits the most though it was not what you expect when ordering this southern favorite.  The Mezze Plate was a miss, I wouldn't order it again. The deviled eggs were good because I didn't have to make them myself! I especially enjoyed the crispy prosciutto on top. There were so many other things that we wanted to try but just ran out of room! I cant wait to go back and try it all! DRINK: AMAZING beer selection!

She then said oh OK, then showed me an iPad with a lot of names then said \"do you see your name?\" I pointed out my name then she walked us to our table. My son and I sat down then realized the table was dirty! Food/crumbs everywhere on the table. We waited for about 10mins before I stopped someone to ask them to please clean our table off. We got water in a container/bottle and in our 4 glasses.... the water was warm. Not sure who likes warm water but we don't so we asked for ice. We ordered our food which we didn't wait long for it to come out but we had no silverware or napkins. We waited for the waitress to come back with it but she didn't so we stopped someone else to ask for that. Our waitress was nice don't get me wrong just felt since it wasn't busy at all, the service, table & host should have been on top of their game. The 3 stars is for the experience we had. I would have gave it a 5 star because the food was awesome! We ordered the Mac and cheese, cutting board and a pepperoni pizza. The food was tasty. I would like to try this place again because of the food but just hoping our experience will be a lot better if we decide to go again.",

One well, the other med. well.  Both came out red inside, basically rare to medium rare.  I sent mine back after the server said it would only take 3 minutes to fix it.  12 minute later mine comes back after everyone else is done with their meal. You've all had that happen where it really disrupts the vib.  When it finally showed up, the side salad was wilted and warm, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or in the microwave.  I sent it back and let them keep it and ate what was left of my wife's salad (which had way too much dressing on it).  The other person at his rare burger and got sick later so maybe I should feel lucky.    I spoke to the manager but it was some young guy and he just smiled while I was talking as if he thought it was funny.  I even asked him why he was smiling and he said \"I am just a happy guy\" so at the end of the day, they don't even care.  They are a new place now and crowded, but if they don't learn how to cook or fix an incorrect order 702 will be seeing fewer and fewer people drop by.  Beware.",

The menu looks good but  food was mediocre and price was definitively too high for the quality provided.  Service was not great either. My husband was inflicted with gas all night after ordering  the Bloody Mary pizza. Whew!!!.  He had abdominal pain and diarrhea the following day. There were 8 of us and will never go back there again.  Please pick another restaurant. Not worth the money or the pain.",

The food we had was delicious too, I had the watermelon tomato stack salad, absolutely delicious and so refreshing for this Summer heat. My husband had the best tasting chicken and waffles made of cornbread and bits of fresh corn with the most flavorful gravy with bacon (just put the diet aside for this, Lol). We also shared the lemon meringue pie in a jar, yummy. My husband had a beer he really liked that had a fruit flavor to it and I had a watermelon mojo that was good too. Our food suggestions were, thanks to our awesome waitress Kaila, she was really helpful. I just love a well informed server when it's your first time at a new place (this is especially since my husband can take awhile to figure out what he wants, Lol!). So Kaila saved my tummy, she was so enthusiastic with her suggestions on the food my husband could make a quicker than usual decision. All I can say, is that you won't be disappointed if you stop by, and yes we'll be back.",

Our server, Zo, blew me away with his knowledge of the menu as it was our first time eating here. He also made it fun with the \"quiz questions\" which tied in with the whole theme of the restaurant. We ordered the mezze plate, chicken sandwich, adobo tacos, a soda, and a glass of wine (the Tempranilla). Everything tasted amazing, was filling, and did not take long to come out after ordering. Our grand total was $46, which was super decent for everything we ordered. After our meal, Zo took the time to tell us about the happy hour and brunch menus, which I can't wait to come back and try. I have eaten at places with a similar menu for less but the theme/decor and service really sets this place apart.",

    "text": "I liked PS 702 for the most part. We came for lunch which worked out as there was a small wait if you came after 12. We were seated right away and I commented how big this place was. The menus and the napkins definitely fit in with the theme so good job on the details. Now on with the goodies...  I couldn't decide on what appetizer I wanted to try. I ended up picking the Mac and cheese over the cauliflower even though the hubby said I could get both. However, being 9 months pregnant I can only take a few bites and feel full. I already decided before I got there that I would get the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. My other half decided on the bangers and mash. The food came out fairly quickly luckily because I was a lil hungry. The fig and prosciutto pizza was good, but a bit spicy for this preggo. I didn't know there was a bit of a spice factor and I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. It was good, but I wish there was more of a fig taste. I couldn't see any fig bits or really taste it so that was a lil disappointing. I didn't try the bangers...only the mash. You know me and carbs! It was a good sized portion for lunch and the price definitely was well worth it. It was gone by the time I was done eating so I assumed it was delicious or my husband was really hungry. ;) As for the Mac and cheese I really liked the kale in it. The ladies next to us kept eyeing our Mac and cheese and I told them they had to get it next time. Not a big fan of the chorizo but that's what your eating partner is for!  Overall, I liked this place and the atmosphere. I wouldn't be afraid of bringing my kids because it is fairly noisy so other people wouldn't notice if your kid was talking loudly. Service was great in the beginning and at the end our server was no where to be found. Granted it was the lunch rush so just be prepared for a bit of a wait if you go during a rush.",

    "text": "This teacher loves recess... AKA, Happy Hour at PS702! I dig the school theme, which carries throughout the restaurant decor (math flashcards clipped up around the bar) and menu (shareable portions are in a section called \"study group\"). They're a theme restaurant without being tacky about it.  FARRO & BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD: surprisingly filling, this could be a late lunch. The sweet curry vinaigrette is interesting and there are a lot of contrasting textures. CRISPY CAULIFLOWER: The breading is super-thin and slightly spicy, with buffalo and bleu dipping sauces, served in a mini cast iron skillet. One of the better versions I've had, not greasy! PARM-TRUFFLE FRITES: You know you want them. They smell great, but let's get real, everyone has fancy fries these days, right? These come with a spicy ketchup and lemon aioli. Get 'em. SPECK & EGGS: Another dish everyone has, with the PS touch adding crispy prosciutto and a kick of spice.  Nicely creamy filling. CRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS: You can't go wrong with ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled with avocado and ahi, lightly dressed in ponzu. One of the lighter options, pairs well with the salad above. PB&J SLIDERS: The dish I was most excited about and the only one I was underwhelmed by. Menu only states \"blackberry habanero jam with smoked bacon\" and for some reason my eyes interpreted the word \"slider\" as a mini sandwich, most likely heated, on a thick challa-style bread. It's actually 3 typical sliders (mini patty and bun) with the two condiments gracelessly smeared on. With less PB and more J, this might have been palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.  All of this, with a beer and tip, for ~$40 can easily feed three. Service was awesome when it was around, bar staff were constantly busy to the point of being overwhelmed. Our server apparently went home altogether, and after nearly half an hour of waiting around to close our tab, Kourtnie kindly took care of us.   Not sure I'd come back outside of recess hours, but it's definitely fun. The food is approachable with some innovative twists rather than the standard safe staples I expected.",

They have a decent selection of beer, but I wouldn't come just for that. The best part was the chewy Nutella ice cream cookie dessert we got. However big you may think it will be, double the size in your mind because it is huge. We shared it between four of us and didn't finish it. The cookie is really very yummy, chewy and moist, with the perfect amount of Nutella on both sides. The vanilla bean ice cream in between was not as flavorful as it looked, but all in all was delicious.  The only con was that drinks, including beers, took a pretty long time to get. For all of us who ordered drinks, they all took a noticeably long time to get to our table. Other than that, not really any complaints. The server was very friendly and knowledgable.",

From the patio, the decor to the vibes.  They have an excellent craft brew selection and the food was excellent. No complaints on that!  The only thing was service. I really struggled giving this place 4 stars but I had to go with 3 because our waiter was horrible. He was super nice, but he literally never checked on us and kept forgetting our drinks. We kept having to ask other waiters to get them for us. I don't think it was his area, but still, he wasn't busy. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and didn't leave until 10 because it took forever to get anything. That's a huge downer.  For the beer: I had Dawn of the Red. It was amazing. It's a hoppier amber with fruit notes. It's now one of my favorites.   Food:  Fiery Calamari - very good and fried perfectly. It wasn't spicy at all though. Shrimp and Grits -  It was super tasty. The grits are more of a grits cake and it has so much in it with a ton of flavor. The sauce was very rich and spicy.  Beef short rib with parmesan mashed potatoes - it was very good and the au jus gravy was very rich.  The NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. I'm going to be 100% honest. I'm not a dessert person. But when I saw this cookie on Yelp, I decided to go here solely for that purpose. And friends, it did NOT disappoint. It was the best cookie and ice cream dessert I've ever had in my life. The cookie was all gooey and soft. So perfect.   Overall - I loved this place. I saw other servers being super tentative to their tables. We just got super unlucky. I would love to go again soon to try out other dishes and other yummy beers.",

    "text": "We arrived on a Tuesday night, around 8 pm. It was surprisingly busy. We requested to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be just a minute while they set our table up. I'm almost positive she forgot about us. We stood there for over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if we were waiting for someone, when we replied that we were waiting for the table, she looked around a little confused.   When we were finally sat at the table that had been ready for almost ten minutes, we were handed menus. We looked them over and got excited about all the delicious options to eat and drink. Lots of craft beers on their menu (see photo). We asked for water while we looked over the menus. Another server came over and took our drink order. My boyfriend got the lavender vanilla and I ordered a Cabernet. We received our drinks, but still no water. My wine was fantastic and my boyfriends drink was perfect for sipping (I'm not really into whiskey, but it was good).   We ordered the quinoa poblano prepared vegan with no cheese, broccolini prepared vegan with sauteed garlic, kale slaw with Brussels prepared vegan, and the brown bag potato fries (not vegan) but for my boyfriend;). Our server came to the table with water (finally) and some bad news. The poblano couldn't be prepped vegan:( it's prepped with cheese, and so is the kale shaved Brussels:(. Back to the menu... I opted for the veggie chili that's created with a mushroom thickening base (vegan). Granted it was 100+ degrees outside I wasn't super excited but it worked. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo Mac and cheese, since we couldn't share the poblano. Our food eventually arrived, but my chili had some cream on top... Had to send it back and wait again. The broccolini was amazing. Perfectly seasoned and sauteed to a crisp crunch. We finished it in no time. We were being attacked by bugs by the time my food made it to the table. Bug lights would be ideal for their patio. The chili was awesome. It came with a kale waffle I couldn't eat but it was filling by itself.   Overall... It was a good meal. A little disorganized and patience was definitely a virtue we were practicing that evening. Would I return? Yes, happy hours on the patio with my laptop, school books, and boyfriend are going to be ideal considering they have convenient USB and outlets located on every booth. It's pretty new... Practice your patience... It has a lot of potential.",

I didn't have any appetizers but I did see the faces of those that did...and they were very happy ones. :) A few of the ape's they ordered were: buffalo cauliflower (like hot wings, but fried cauliflower instead) and deviled eggs (looked awesome).  Between the 13 of us, everyone tried lots of different food - I had the farro & brussel salad with seared scallops and it was incredible!  The flavor profile was unique (with a sweet curry dressing) and the scallops were cooked VERY well.  (I feel like it's so easy to screw scallops up, and they did SUCH a good job!)  The bison burger looked fantastic and the mac and cheese looked even better.    OH - and the beer menu is LEGIT!  PLUS...can we discuss this amazing thing that happened at 9PM?  A crazy buzzer went off and for the next 15 minutes, all the draft beers were just a DOLLAR.  15 minutes later, the buzzer went off again, and they went up to $2. (They do this every 15 minutes til 10PM.)   Also - one of the servers, Jamie F, was freaking awesome.  I asked her to help me choose what to order and she was super thorough and went through the handful of dishes I had questions about.  (Plus, I ended up getting what I really wanted.)  She even stopped by to make sure I liked it afterward.  She really made the experience THAT much better for us!  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Another welcome addition to Downtown Summerlin, recently opened a couple of weeks ago, they sure got it together pretty quick. It is a huge restaurant and has a very large outdoor area with booths and even ceiling fans as well as beer pong, it appeared. I didn't go outside because it is an oven here in Vegas. I was shocked that people sit outside and eat, there were like 5 tables of people when I went sitting outside. Go for it, if that is your thing.   We sat in the bar area which I felt was pretty spacious but it filled up quick. My friends arrived at 3:30 when it first started and said a couple tables were available. When I arrived around 4, the place was filling up quick. I think we left around 5:30 and I saw a wait, about 6-10 people outside. If possible, I suggest coming early to reserve a spot for happy hour \"recess.\" This restaurant is really cute on the details without going overboard on the school theme, but if you look close you will see flashcards above the bar and all kinds of little fun cool details everywhere. I am a teacher, so I don't need to be reminded of school please, but for me the decorations were cool not annoying or cheesy.   We ordered:  Crispy Cauliflower-served with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese  sooo good!  Farro and Brussel Sprouts Salad-delicious!!  Dip Duo- not so great, The bread was not crispy nor soft, it seemed old and had a strange feeling to it, dips were just ok, nothing special   Speck & Eggs- I enjoyed this. It was salty but good.   Crispy Naked Wings- I am not a big fan of wings, but these were really good.   Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos-I enjoyed these too!  Parmesan Truffle Fries- I have to say I have been unable to find a place that does truffle fries just how I want it. To me, these were just right! Loved the lemon aioli dipping sauce on the side  My hubby had beers and he did not complain. I wish they had some girly cocktails on their happy hour menu, not just well drinks. That is kind of boring.   Service was good, plenty of workers everywhere, and I am happy we have a new good restaurant to go to, especially with such a good happy hour.",

Good flavor, the homemade ketchup was awesome. They were a tiny bit soggy and mushy. They lacked that wonderful tater tot crunch. and Buffalo Cauliflower- Just...YES! Yummy!

    "text": "Public 702 is located in downtown Summerlin over Crave. The inside is intelligently designed with old, retro school items such as lunch boxes, pom poms, megaphones in display cases and old bleachers nailed to the wall. The menu looks like a black and white speckled composition book and the napkins are lined notebook paper. Very smart marketing.  Food was quite good, each item ordered was said to be delicious. Appetizers were buffalo cauliflower, Mac and cheese, bacon and cheese tater tots. Food ordered, Huntsburger with brown bag fries, chopped salad, roasted poblano with stuffed veggies and quinoa, fried chicken and waffles.  So why 3 stars? Our server!! Our dinner took 3 hours. I repeatedly saw her in the server hallway eating and talking to the other servers. She took 15 minutes to come over to us after we were seated, another 15 to come back with drinks, she disappeared while we waited to place our food orders, once other servers delivered our food, then not once were we checked on to see if we needed anything, my husband had no utensils. When we were finished, we kept waving down other servers to get our server for the check. Our server never arrived. Another server finally brought us our check. Our table time from sit down to leaving was almost 3 hours.  Doubt I'd go out of my way to go back, I'll try other restaurants in the area.",

For brunch they actually have several drinks options you can choose from - mimosas, beermosas, bloody Mary's, or michelada - and you can have 4 of them in any combination you'd like for just $10, which I can say is more than plenty! The staff were friendly on both occasions and the atmosphere was great for socializing. There are also TV's for those people who want to get their football fix.",

    "text": "The concept and restaurants of Downtown Summerlin have good intentions. Unfortunately, like every other restaurant I've tried in DTS, Public School is a bust. My friends and I arrived at 9pm on a Thursday. We walk in and two people are talking at the doorway. Oh wait, they're not just two people who are hanging out lounging on the doorway with horrible posture, they work here apparently despite their nonchalance toward any potential customers.   We were seated in a HUGE booth for the 3 of us that was unbussed with crumbs and sticky crap all over. Lovely. When asking for directions to the restrooms, same rude service. So we get our table cleaned, find the bathroom, and eventually order some very mediocre food. Fried cauliflower is NOT amazing like everyone describes. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's just fried cauliflower for $9 or something. I think their mark-up on this is 999981625536% as a head of cauliflower is $.89 at the store.  We ordered the chicken & waffles that everyone raved of and was shown on our menu. We were given tandoori brick chicken instead? I guess our waitress didn't hear us, but the mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken & waffles is no longer on the menu, despite what we saw infront of our eyes! So the host who was lounging at the door is handing out old menus and the server who assumed we said one thing didn't ask again to clarify. So when she brings out the wrong item, she said \"is that okay? Do you want to keep it?\" Ha!!! If someone ordered chicken and waffles, do you think tandoori brick chicken with middle eastern spices will fill that craving? No. Of course we don't want the brick chief and want chicken and waffles which despite being off the menu, they made for us?   So we finally get the chicken and waffles. Waffles were good hitting every one of my taste buds - sweet, savory, luscious, crispy. The chicken was disgusting. They were fried chicken tenders, but the tenders were HUGE and cut poorly. Think about a 3 inch chicken tender... The only good thing we ate was the kale Caesar salad which I would order again if someone dragged me to public school 702. If I wasn't bound and dragged, you would never find me here again.   My review is confusing, but so was our experience. Everything about the night contradicted another. Hosts, servers, and chefs had no idea what was going on and were not working as a team. The restaurant has been open long enough to fix these issues so there are no excuses for our disappointing night.",

They opened two tabs and the bartender says we closed out his tab and have to pay for the second one. Basically pocketed the rest of the cash. He wouldn't show us the tab he closed out either.

We were slightly skeptical because some of the reviews weren't very good but we absolutely loved it and I even told my husband I wanted to do a review because I loved it so much. We sat on the patio (in June after sunset) and it was very comfortable and a fun environment. We got the watermelon and heirloom salad stack which was refreshing and very flavorful. We also got the bison burger with fries and it was good sized and amazingly delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant!!",

Happy Hour menu was good.  The buffalo cauliflower is fantastic.  The margarita pizza, eh, just okay.  The beer selection was GREAT.  Ended up with a Brainless Belgian, high octane, smooth finish, really good.  Love finding new beers when we go out.  The place was dead.  It was a Tuesday, so might be the day?  But really surprised that no one was at the happy hour.  Huge place.  Big balcony, nicely done.  Prices were great for happy hour.  I would have to come back for dinner to give it another rating, but for happy hour - job well done.  Would be a great place for a private event.",

The fries are the weakest link but only because there's nothing really different about them.   My only complaint is that I ordered a Diet Coke and it comes in a bottle in which you're charged for refills.  Sorry guys, but the majority of your competition gives those away.

    "text": "This was the worst service I've ever had. My boyfriend and I went in for lunch. There was about a ten minute wait to be seated, which is no big deal. Then we got seated and we waited atleast 10 more minutes until a server that wasn't even in our section, realized no one has even greeted us, or taken out drink order. She took our drink order and then our actual server (the receipt said her name was lauren) showed up a few minutes later to take our drink order and we said someone else took it. She then took our food order I got a ccb with no bun and Brussel and kale slaw. My boyfriend got a chicken and waffles on their Sunday brunch. She leaves to put in our order then returns about 10 minutes later and asks how everything is going and if we were ready to order food. And we just looked at her confused and said that she had already taken our order. She said oh yeah and then stares at my empty iced tea and leaves. I assumed she was getting me more. She then is walking around almost looking like she was trying to be busy but not really doing anything. Our food showed up mine with a bun on it that I asked not to have. I just took it off. Both our meals were delicious. She did not stop back in though to make sure everything was ok. Waited another 15 minutes until we realized she isn't comin back and asked another server for more drinks. Then when we finished our meals she stopped by twice to see if we wanted more drinks. Yeah now that were done eating she wants to be attentive? It was almost humorous how absent she was.  *** someone from public school messaged me on yelp and appologized and asked for my email to further discuss. I gave them my boyfriends email. It's been almost three days now, and they never reached out. Same half ass service as the restaurant.",

    "text": "I am so pissed that I wasted my motherfathers day at this place when I was so excited about coming here all week.   So me and my girlfriends (party of 4) sat in the bar in a sharing large table in the middle of the bar. We sat down and waited 10 min for anyone to greet us. Finally a girl name Valarie came to greet us with no menus with her. So we waited another 5 min to get them. You can tell that she was very flustered and couldn't maintain multiple  tables. Finally get the menus and she walks away...WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MENUS OR DRINK SPECIALS FOR LUNCH! Lets do the math...we have been here almost 20 min and we have nothing to drink or water! It takes her forever to come and take a drink order that was horrible.....we asked questions and she never got into detail just answered quickly cuz you can tell she had no time to help us with our decisions. She takes my drink order and walks away and never takes any of my other guest drink order. WTF????? It took another 10 min to get 1 freaken mimosa....I look around and I see people are pissed and getting no service. During this time Valarie is taking new tables and forgets almost every step that you need to do. She comes back with WATER FINALLY!!!!   She comes back to take our food order and I said \"how about taking my friends drink order first before you walk away\" she laughs and says \"ok what can I get for you\"  I wanted to walk out but I saw some cool food items and I was starving and $10 bottomless mimosa I thought it was a great deal! So she takes a drink order for everyone and waited another 10 min just to get them......IM SO FREAKEN FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT....Im am realizing that out food order is going to take even longer. So I flag down a server to help us and that it would be nice to get us another server that knows what they are doing. Bloody Mary was super spicy, like they put a whole thing of pepper and Tabasco. We put it to the side and never drank it. The rest of the girls had water since it was the quickest thing to quench our thirst.   Finally ordered FOOD! Tots, smothered burrito, Fried Califlower, speck & eggs, mac & chz , ahi tacos.......The only thing that was good because they were cold items were Speck & Eggs and Ahi Tacos.   The tots looked like charcoal with sauce on the side.....WTF? The funny thing is someone actually put this on the table???? Smothered burrito was so hard my friend could barley cut through the tortilla....the eggs tasted rotten.....It was horrible.  Anything that was served hot was disgusting. Mac & Chz was dry and the chorizo was like rocks.....  We spoke to a manager and he replaced 2 items the burrito and Tots. During this time I had asked for another bottomless mimosa over 15 min as my glass was empty (glass where are so small its so stupid).   During this time there was a couple having brunch for fathers day and they had there burger made 4 TIMES! This guy was so pissed instead they gave him a nutella ice cream dessert....???? ARE U SERIOUS! As there was a food critic right behind them and ordered a salad and took 2 bites and left.   The energy surrounding us was so weird and off.  During this whole time Valarie came by maybe 2 times and said \"Is everything ok?\" We just said yes because we were so upset how things were going that we just wanted to speak to a manager. We told him what was going on and he said he was so sorry and he would take care of the bill. His name was Nick...He seemed not authentic with his apology. There was no deep apology other than he was sorry and he would take care of it. Maybe because he was going to every table around us hearing the same story.....Give this place 2 months to fire and re-hire a solid staff that can handle a fast pace restaurant and hopefully they can hire people that are passionate about there brand! WACK!",

    "text": "Amazing food, terrible service. This was our first time here and we were so excited to try. The hostess was extremely rude to start when I told her we had a party of 8. We had no expectation of being seated right away so I'm not sure where her attitude came from. Once we were seated we ordered some appetizers, waters, and drinks. There were four times where all 8 of us had empty glasses of water and had to ask someone to bring us more. I was never brought a refill on my lemonade (I think the fresh lemonade was missing an ingredient so i was ok dealing with water) without asking multiple times for one. One out of four of our appetizers never came out and we had to track down our waiter to remind him to bring it. The food came out and he never checked on our food (or water). One bison burger was ordered medium well and was completely rare. It was picked at around the edges but barely eaten, but I'm sure it didn't phase the lazy waiter. When it was time for our 4 separate checks he pulled the \"our system can't do that\" bs and had us literally write down per couple what we had, the price of each item, add it all up, include tax and give him the tab at the end for him to ring up. It took about 20 minutes to write everything out and then the computer magically rang separate checks.   Now onto the good food: cauliflower buffalo appetizer was my favorite. We also tried the bacon cheese tots, chorizo Mac n cheese, and the calamari, which were all a huge hit. I had the steak with truffle butter and Mac n cheese. It was a good size portion and very tasty! My husband had the bison burger which was pretty good but his was also not cooked properly. The prosciutto pizza was alright but a little difficult to eat because the prosciutto is not cut up into pieces, and the chicken and waffles were great!",

We went around 11:30, it was pretty busy, We were seated right away, which was good because we brought both kids. Our waitress approached us as soon as we were seated and let us know about the menu and how everything works. We ordered for our kids right away and orders drinks for ourselves. My wife ordered a bloody Mary and Our waitress recommended a beer for me, so I decided to go with it. When she returned she brought the Bloody Mary and the kids drinks, 20 min or so went by and still no beer for me.... My wife decides to ask the waitress and she said there must be a problem at the bar, I noticed she went to the computer and put my beer through because she must have forgot to put it in. got my beer another 10 minutes later (30 min after I ordered it). The kids got sliders, and we ordered the huntsman burger and calamari to share. we got the burger (no side plates) and kids sliders but no calamari. The burger was delicious! once we finished our burger we asked the waitress if the calamari was coming out still. She went to the kitchen and returned with no calamari and told us our order was bumped..... Not sure what that means or how that happened. We get the calamari 10 min later and ask to get it to go since we were already done with everything else.  The food was ok, the service wasn't so great.",

    "text": "I have tried this restuarant now 4 times and each time it loses a star but tonight was my final visit.. 1)The inside is so loud it is hard to carry on a conversation so we love to sit outside, but tonight they had a very loud DJ which made the inside seem quiet.  They also kept sounding off a loud horn which was quite annoying.  The ambiance does not reflect the restuarants name; Public School, it seems more like a loud bar with a sub par disconnected menu. 2) We ordered Salmon with  vegetables and steak salad...The salmon was delicious, but the vegetables tasted like dish soap and the lettuce served with the 4 pieces of thinly sliced steak looked and tasted like day old bag lettuce...a little salt and pepper would have been nice to enhance some flavor, but our server never returned until we were done with our meal. 3) We ordered 3 glasses of wine, 1 califlower appetizer, 1 Steak Salad, and 1 Salmon with vegetables..approximately $95.00.  They did take $11.00 off for the dish soap veggies, but the service was challenging and for paying almost $100.00 it was very disappointing.  It's so unfortunate since it is a great location.",

IM SO HAPPY I ENDED UP HERE !  First things first the service was amazing !  We sat at the bar and  Tom was the bartender.  He was more than accommodating.  Id be considered what you would call a challenging customer.  He was so accommodating and answered all of my questions without hesitation. The beer list here is fantastic, and so is their list of liquor.  They had a lot of things I had never heard of, including GInsky.  When I had asked to smell the bottle Tom was kind enough to pour me a small taster.  And sure enough, because of that, he made the sale ! That stuff is amazing ! My boyfriend had the fish and chips and raved about it! All the sauces have their own spin which is also super fun ! I had a steak Cobb salad.  My steak was cooked just the way I asked,  and for once I didn't need the extra dressing that I had asked for.   We will be back!  So happy to have stumbled on this gem !",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have eaten here several times. And while no meal was ever perfect, some were definitely better than others. When the service has been great, the food has been mediocre. When the food has been awesome, the service has lacked, and ultimately, I think the service in general leaves alot to be desired. The past few times we have dined there, we weren't greeted promptly, had to wait an unusual amount of time for drinks, or been left without refills for the entire meal, and the food has been a solid three star rating. We do have our favorites on the menu, like the buffalo cauliflower and the charcutterie platter, which have been consistently good. The chicken and waffles, however, has been consistently bland, and sometimes downright bad. The fish and chips is a safe choice, and usually pretty good. The burgers are always hit or miss, and just tonight, we ordered the shorty bowl, which was pretty good, but the egg was cold, and cold runny egg yolk is not my favorite, by far.  I want this place to be better than it is, and at this point, given the cost of the entrees and the lackluster food and service that feels like the staff just doesn't care, I don't think it will be in our rotation any more.",

Mac and cheese with chorizo was sinful, but in the best way. Mini burgers were also a great choice. We ordered the bacon/cheddar tots from the regular menu to see if they really were worth the hype. They were!!! Fried but not greasy and perfect bacon to cheese ratio. I was mildly disappointed in the margarita flatbread. It just wasn't anything special. There are so many more items to choose from.  Beer selection was great! Our server, Vanessa, was so helpful in our choices. She gave food recommendations too and was very pleasant. She enhanced our first experience and we will be back for sure.",

It was delicious. The side salad was a little bitter, and a blemish on an otherwise excellent meal.  Bottom line: make it a point to go back to School. You'll be glad you did.",

I ordered the shorty bowl with an iced tea and my friend had the fish and chips with a lemonade.   First, greeted by our waiter and his trainee.  They got our drinks and her lemonade looked like water.  Tasted like water with a hint of lemon.   We ordered.  I was told the shorty bowl was the best thing on the menu.  Great!   Food arrived and I was excited!  I couldn't even stomach it.  There was a grit throughout every layer in my bowl, as if maybe the arugula wasn't washed?  It was disgusting.  We waited for our waiter to come by, but the place was filling up with the lunch crowd.  Crickets (for us anyway).  My friend liked the taste of her fish and chips but the batter was super thick.  She literally took the fish out and showed me the thick shell of cooked beer batter.   Finally the trainee re-appears and takes our dishes.  Mine was hardly touched and didn't even question if everything was ok, or was there something wrong.   I expected a whole different level of food and service with public school...certainly didn't live up to what I'd heard Giving 2 stars for just wanting to like the place versus the 1 for the gritty sand filled dish.",

    "text": "I come here all the time after work for a drink with my coworker. I'm not a huge fan of beer, so I won't mention anything about that but the fact that they have an incredibly long list of different beers. I prefer to drink wine, and they have a nice selection. The gentlemen at the bar are always willing to give samples to try before you decide. My friend and I usually order a bottle of wine, as single glasses are no less than $9 each. The bottle we order is usually around $36, which I find a bit pricey, but not surprising seeing as we are in Downtown Summerlin. I absolutely love the fiery fried calamari, it's a must have every time I come. I've also ordered the cutting board which comes with a selection of cheeses and meats with bread, great pairing for wine. I've ordered the sliders, margherita pizza, and truffle fries... all amazing. I have always come in and sat in the bar area, and service is great. Food almost always comes out quickly. Things are a bit wild during Happy Hour. Waitresses take ages to come to your table, and takes longer to get food. You only receive happy hour specials at the bar, and the bar area fills up very quickly as it's not too big. I don't know much about the service at the tables. I love the atmosphere, the music, and the whole vibe here. One of my favorite bars in downtown Summerlin. My only reasoning for the 4 stars are the prices. If they knocked a few dollars off, this place would be perfect.",

No worries- we'll keep coming back. :-)",

    "text": "Public-school was a fun restaurant infusing culinary accomplishment with foods found in a public school cafeteria. I was pleasantly surprised with the delicious meal. Generally with strongly themed restaurants the decore overshadows the taste, But with public-school both were surprisingly well done. We started with the artisan meats and cheeses and bacon tater tots. The tater tots were simply amazing. Obviously hand crafted in-house, the fried combination of hashed potatoes, cheese and bacon was pleasing, but the pairing with sriracha-ketchup was perfect. The meats and cheeses were just ok. The only wow on the platter was the goat cheese with marmalade. For the main course, I had the chicken and waffles with bacon red-eye gravy, syrup and hot sauce. I was highly impressed with the cornmeal waffles and the sauces used to bring the course together. The combination of sweet, salty and spivey from the sauces cut through to traditional home style dish. I loved the meal despite the chicken being ordinary and under spiced. All-in-all, a great meal for the slightly inflated price.",

I've had buffalo cauliflower at other restaurants, where it was fried but still light; that was not the case here. The dish was also overly salty. The edamame hummus was also terribly salty but had no other flavors; if it had tahini, it was completely overpowered by salt. The flatbread that came with it was okay, but the za'atar on it was too strong. The Brussels sprouts were okay, but again too overpowered by oil. It was the kind of side dish that comes with about a dozen Brussels sprouts, but after three, your palate is done. I was also surprised that two dishes that could be vegan-friendly actually aren't because the cheese is already incorporated. For example, the quinoa salad sounded great, but the feta is already mixed in with the quinoa, so getting the salad without feta can't be done.",

Have been here a couple times and have yet to have something on the food menu I would not rave about.

Bookshelves, books, world maps, an amazing solar system lighting piece, chalkboards, list goes on..The menu is on a 'notebook', loved it. And specialty drinks listed on college ruled paper on a small clipboard. Definitely a school-like atmosphere. We started with tater tots with sriracha ketchup (bomb!!), and ahi tacos (tasted a little too acidic for me), then went on to order the steak salad (steak perfectly cooked, though the salad itself a little too oily for my taste. Couldn't tell if I was drooling or if it was the salad oil dripping, but overall good.) My colleague ordered the Adobo taco with cilantro lime rice (I should've ordered that, that was crazy delicious), then sampled a few brews before deciding what we wanted. Our waitress was amazing, though I have to admit the service was a bit slower. It slowed after we ordered our main dishes (appetizers came out fairly quickly), so I can't blame the waitress (likely an issue in the kitchen, there weren't too many diners), as we were served after about 30-35 minutes (the drinks did hold us down enough to barely notice the time). Since we were in a bit of a rush at the end of the meal, we asked for our deserts to go, which we came to find out ALWAYS includes ice cream, so the waitress kindly offered me a gift card instead. I was happy with that, as I will definitely come back for recess.",

The waitress was kind of clueless. She didn't know much about the ingredients in the entrees. We had no silverware on the table before being seated so we had to ask her for some when our food first came out, but we had to remind her that we were still waiting for silverware the second time she came to drop off the other meals. I ordered a Drink & I could see the Bartender making it..... Then it just sat there- for like 10 mins...... And I can see all the other staff just standing near the bar, taking shots of Beer???!!!?? And the waitress finally bought it over. :-/ Management needs to up their team or train their young staff to be more professional. Probably don't plan on ever returning to this joint. It's too bad, the architecture of the place really fits the name which makes it a cool hang out.",

We were a party of 2, went inside to check the wait, hostess mentioned that it would be a 20-25 minute wait, gave our phone number and waited inside between the rest rooms and hostess stand.  At the 30 minute mark, there were guests that came in after us that were seated.  Hostesses saw that we were still there, never said a thing to us.  40 minutes was our top wait time.  I told the hostess to remove our name, and she asked what our name was and removed it. Service tip, the front door is the first experience the guests have when you walk into a restaurant.  Acknowledge your guests, keep better track of who has been seated and who hasn't, especially guests that are in front of your face for 40 minutes, advise guests of a longer wait time on a Friday night.  If they get seated earlier, bonus for your team!  If someone removes their name from the wait, have your hostess ask if there was an issue, offer an apology (after watching us wait!), say something!  Growing pains - i'm sure. We won't be back, nor will we suggest to our friends and family.",

A seat on the outside patio in the evening would be nice and I have a feeling will fill up quickly for dinner, especially when the weather is nice. We had the mezzo platter (small portions of hummus, babaganoush, olive tapenade, feta, roasted chickpeas and pita), grilled watermelon and tomato stack salad, bangers and mash, tacos and a couple kids meals. Don't have a bad thing to say about the taste and quality of the food. All was delicious. Kids meals were standard. The tacos stood out, so good. Very trendy, slightly pricey, but nothing absorbent or out of the ordinary for the area. Didn't try any beer, seemed to be a decent selection. We'll come back for lunch to try some new stuff and I'd love to come back and see the dinner menu. Our poor server had a slight mishap with the mustard but she was very sweet and felt super bad. Highly encourage giving it a try. We'll be back.",

Now my meal was supposed to come with chicken instead it came with chorizo, but it was still good anyways. I had a fruity drink, I forget the name, something jungle lol. It was really good but beware it is really strong. It alcohol will creep up on you. My husband had the flat iron steak and he loved it. We also had dessert. My husband did not enjoy his brownie at all. It was way too rich and dark chocolate for him. I had the Nutella cookie and it was pretty good. The prices and portions are good and the staff was very nice. I would def come back and try out the rest of the stuff on their menu!",

What's not to like about an eggs Benedict pizza or stuffed French toast? And they always have the best selection of craft beers! Every time I'm there, there is something new to taste! And most times I'm educated (see what I did there? Lol) on a new beer I haven't even heard of. Also a fun night out with the live music! Last time I was in, one of the performers was from the Voice!!!! Do yourself a favor and check it out!!!! It won't disappoint!",

The bar is always packed and the energy is awesome, but the restaurant isn't, which means to me they aren't bringing in enough servers to accommodate the group. For such a cool idea, I hope they amp up the service because I want to love it. I'll likely be back as well.",

The Cutting Board consisted of 3 small portions of artesian cheese, stale bread that was soaked with butter, a huge pile of olives, candy coated nuts and three small pieces of cured meats for $16.  Both were overpriced for the amount and quality of the food.  Dinner wasn't any better.  Prosciutto and Arugula pizza was weird.  The cheese didn't incorporate the toppings, just piles of arugula and pieces of cold meat lying on top of the pizza.  Made it very hard to eat without all of the toppings falling off - $15.  The Margarita pizza had limited toppings, hardly any cheese.  The best part was probably the crust.  Drinks ran $12 for a cocktail, we got there for happy hour which included only rail alcohol.  Expensive outing, left hungy.  Wouldn't go back.",

I started off with their Moscow Mule (a MUST HAVE), and enjoyed their cheese and meats appetizer- which was good. My girlfriend enjoyed their asian Salmon dish, while I had the skirt steak, medium-well. I can tell you the salmon was out of the world and perfectly cooked- a nice seasoned outside and a flaky and scrumptious inside. My stake was a bit cold, but the flavor was good. All and all, this place has great food and drinks for any occasion, especially when you are looking to get off work and blow off some steam!  With ample space, large screen TVs, great customer service, and a central location inside Downtown Summerlin, this place is a must-visit!",

I splurged on them with a friend before my main dish of bangers and mash. The bangers and mash is good, too, but not as good as some of their other items I've had.  My last visit I ate the shrimp and grits and it was BETTER than shrimp and grits I've had in Charleston, SC. AH-MAY-ZING. I ate and ate and ate until I was about to burst, because I just couldn't get enough. The grits come in this fried patty form, but the minute you take a fork to it, it crumbles into succulent grits with a bit of a crunch on the outside. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the sauce that they pour over it all is so good I'd eat it as a soup by itself!  We've had the meat and cheese platter, and the fish and chips too.  Everything is delicious.  The only downside is that when the weather is too cold to enjoy sitting outside, the inside is NOISY. Like, it isn't going to be where you wind down after a long day. It will probably make your headache worse.  Overall, this is my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

The food is eclectic, so it's hard to dig through their menu. It would be nice if there were few simpler items on the menu for just enjoying some food while drinking your beer. I had to look things up on Google to figure out what they were in some cases. That said, the bison burger wasn't bad, but way too expensive for what little of a patty you get. I've had them before that were much bigger and cheaper.  The waitress was great at first, but then she disappeared until we were done. I don't remember her coming back once during the meal itself.",

I ordered breakfast burrito which was meh (2/5). It had no taste but I ate it anyway because I didn't want to be THAT person. (Btw I ended up taking half it it to go and it tasted way better cold).  We also ordered bottomless drinks. BE WARNED - drinks are not bottomless. You can mix and match from mimosa, Bloody Mary and beermosa but you only get 4 drinks total for $15. It wouldn't have been a big deal but we called before we went here and asked about the price for bottomless drinks and it was not mentioned that they are \"almost bottomless\".  It left us disappointed and we will not be returning.",

What was the point of making a reservation, if we needed to wait 2 hours? Our waitress was inattentive and mediocre at best. We tried to order drinks, but they didn't have most of what we wanted. What bar in Las Vegas doesn't have Red Bull, Belvedere vodka, Captain Morgan and fireball? We ordered the naked wings and requested ranch dressing, but they said they never have ranch dressing.   The empty glasses kept accumulating on our table as we ordered round after round of drinks. She never took the empty glasses away. Our waitress disappeared for a long periods of time, even though they weren't really even that busy. When we asked for our checks at the end of the meal, they were all incorrect.    In the ladies restroom, there was a complete mess. There was no toilet paper in the stalls and the floors were messy. When we left the restaurant, I told the hostess. She asked me if anybody vomited in the restroom. She made it sound as if a lack of vomit on the floor, made all the rest of the mess acceptable.",

I love the whole set up which was very inviting.  The menu was very intriguing which I loved.  We all ordered something different and all enjoyed our meal.  They had an excellent beer/micro brew selection.  Excellent experience and I hope to come back try new items from the menu.",

It was busy, but not jam packed, and the atmosphere was slightly upscale, yet relaxing.  I didn't feel out of place walking into the restaurant, and my party and I only had to wait about five minutes at the bar before being seated outside.  The patio was a great place to sit and talk, while noshing on some apps and drinking some specialty beers.  Their selection of beers was plenty fine for my liking and both the hostess that sat us and the server who waited on us were kind and attentive.  My only qualm was that the food we ordered seemed a little sub par for the price point paid.  I have no issue spending money on good food, it's one of the indulgences that's completely worth it.  But the Tuna lacked flavor, and the calamari seemed a touch overdone.    Still though, as I only had appetizers there, I would be more than willing to go back once again and give some of the entrees a try and see how they do there.  It was a fun little place, and it was just the right combination of fun and classy in my book.",

    "text": "The best way I can describe Public School 702 is as a high class pub.  It is located in a nice part of Summerlin and is kind of hidden upstairs in a mall.  But once you get in, immediately you experience the intended vibe.    The menus look like notebooks and there is appropriate memorabilia filling the walls to give off that public school atmosphere.  They have a very good craft beer list, including main stays and rotating options that they write on a chalkboard at the entrance.  The beers are towards the expensive side ($7-$9), but they offer rare varieties and local brews so it is worth it in some cases.  The food was surprisingly above average.  This is why I look at this restaurant as a high class pub.  The food wasn't just bangers and mash or fish and chips.  I had a quinoa salad which was both large and delicious.  Another member of my party had a lamb burger, and another a kale salad.  We also shared a nice looking watermelon tower of a salad.  Overall the food is great, the beer selection is great, the Happy Hour is supposedly great (food specials and $1 off beers) and the location is great.  Try this place if you're looking for a better Yard House.",

    "text": "Mini Yelp gathering with some of my favorite yelpers in Vegas. Most of us was the first time dining at Public School 702. Including me never been but for the most part only heard great reviews! It one of many restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. Off topic say love love the fact Downtown Summerlin finally filling out all of the retail and restaurant spaces. I still remember first open walking around like is anything open.   Back task at hand. So we had big party so got to see decent amount of food off the menu. No reason but good one for us. The kitchen cooked up extra appetizers so found home at our table. I got try the devil eggs, and bacon cheddar tots. Not sure if extra or someone on the table ordered it but Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. The presentation not only for all \"For The Table\" or appetizers thought was well done. I like the incorporation of cutting boards. To the little cast iron servers for both the Tots and Cauliflower. I think both of them use the same breading cause looking the same. It nice golden brown outside, hot on inside, and fried goodness. The tots admit enjoyed the best out of the three. I enjoy the combination of bites of bacon and the cheddar all combine in one bite. The other two never ok but nothing special. The eggs really liked the presentation the most out of the three.   My entree went with the Fried JIdori Chickem & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. It been while since had Fried Chicken and Waffles. The last time was down south in Atlanta, GA. it was pretty darn good. Public School 702 took Fried Chicken and Waffles another level. The fried chicken not your normal wing and thigh pieces. I enjoy mixed it up then traditional. They incorporated chicken tender meat with the breast. Still have the wing/drumstick. One of the things that stood out for me once got the dish. The hot sauce had on top of the chicken but not completely soaked in it. The batter they use fan of BIG TIME. I love the crispy crust. It has ton of flavor and the meat inside on all the pieces was cooked perfection. The waffles adding green chili not just plain waffles. Yay! f could would order each one separate just double the amount. When put both together then throw some of the bacon sauce or whatever in side dish. Unreal delicious. Memorable. Hearty. No doubt heart attack. Once in while want indulge heavy not good for your health dish. This is the way to go.   I wanted to try the sirachi ketchup/ mustard sauce with the brown bag of fries. The fries are just that fries. The sauces are devine. The honey mustard sauce that could use for spread on ANY sandwich. The sirachi one of my stable condiments and fan of. It was tasty. If want take fries another level make sure use both the sauces.   Everyone else dishes on the table looking good. I got try the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I like it!!!! It had nice balance between the truffle and cheese. It came with the steak dish I believe. I know your can order for side.   The staff is awesome. Our server she was amaZing. There was nine of us she on top of it. Explained everything for the first timers like myself. Made great suggestions on the menu. Friendly. I know lot of times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. She said not problem at all. Think two or three appetizers lucked out got for free. Thank you Public School 702. I will be attending class again sooner then later............Good stuff!!!!",

The inside of the restaurant was packed, no seating at all, and the noise was deafening. I was glad we were able to find a seat outside. Even outside was getting super packed. If tables were full, people were sitting on the arms of couches or standing.   Our server, Vanessa, was incredible. Honestly, it's been awhile since I've received such good service. She was great with beer and appetizer suggestions. And, as they were so busy, she let us know that things would take awhile to come out. What a concept! I feel that more waitstaff members in Vegas need to be doing this! It's an easy to set realistic expectations and enable diners to plan accordingly.   Drink orders, as warned, took awhile. But I was surprised how quickly everything else came out. Our total order was two rounds of beers and two appetizers: Buffalo cauliflower and Mezza plate. They make the mezza plate with white bean hummus. So, if you are a hummus hater, do not despair. Try this instead! The buffalo cauliflower DOES live up to the hype. GET IT. Don't think, just do it. Although, I'm really not a fan of the chunky blue cheese dressing that goes with this.   Added bonus: Our waitress noticed we had too much humus and not enough bread and brought more out free of charge.   Thank you, Vanessa, for the amazing service!",

I love a good theme and I like it when a business really commits; (3) those PB&J sliders are money; (4) huge beer selection.  The bad: (1) the deviled eggs and kale Caesar were no bueno. The eggs were bland and the salad was really sweet. Unexpected with a Caesar and not in a good way; (2) the bar area gets really loud so conversation can be a challenge.  The final word: really unique spot in Downtown Summerlin. It's worth a visit and, in my case, a second visit. I went on a Tuesday night and the bar was a sausage fest. On a Saturday night, this place must be a single lady's wet dream.",

    "text": "Having wanted to try the original downtown LA location for the longest time, and just never getting the chance to, Public School 702 was probably one of my more anticipated restaurant openings this year. This new location in Downtown Summerlin sits on the upper level between Crave, and the yet to open second Shake Shack. It's a pretty large space with a lot of seating, a good size bar area, and an outdoor patio as well. But even with all that, it gets busy, and you'll likely have to wait for a table. For just 2 people at 7:30 on a Wednesday night, the wait still tipped 30 minutes.  After being seated, we were handed their regular notebook style menu that has a quite a few appetizers, and all kinds of entrees from burgers to chicken and waffles. We were also handed a separate list of their current rotating tap beers. That's one of my favorite parts about PS702. Not only is there \"normal\" beer list all craft offerings, but their rotating stuff seems to be filled with unique and even some hard to find limited release stuff. If you're not a beer drinker though, they've got plenty of cocktails and wines too.  Since there was only 2 of us and pretty much every appetizer on the menu sounded good, we decided to get a few items to share, and then split one dinner. We started off with some of the smaller items, the Speck & Eggs, and the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. At just $6 for either of these, they are must try starters in my opinion. The eggs were perfectly boiled, had a creamy yok filling, and the little piece of proscuitto was a nice salty, crispy touch. And the buffalo cauliflower was excellent. We've had a few different versions of it at other places in California, where it seems to be more popular, and PS702's was excellent. It's got a thicker breading and was served piping hot with sauce on the side, instead of tossed.  The other appetizers we tried were a little on the bigger side. Their Mezze Plate is huge for $8 and includes 5 different things to pick off or dip in, and huge stack of thin, crispy pita-like bread. My favorite things were the marinated feta, and something I had never had anywhere else before, crispy chickpeas. We also really enjoyd the Chorizo Mac & Cheese. It was the most expensive starter we got at $9, but well worth it. The pasta was cooked perfectly, it's super cheesy, there's plenty of chorizo in it, and even though I thought it was strange at first, the salt and vinegar chips on top added both flavor and texture.  By this time, we were pretty full, but our order of the Fried Jidori Chicken & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles was already on the way. Sadly, it didn't impress nearly as much as the appetizers, especially with it's $22 price tag. I personally really liked the slightly spicy waffle with the cornbread like texture, but the wifey wasn't a fan. And even though the flavor on the chicken was excellent, it was mushy and only one part, a leg, was bone-in. The gravy had good flavor as well, but because the chicken was soggy, it made the whole dish just overly mushy. Had the chicken been crispy, this would have been a huge hit for me.  Unlike a lot of the other reviews, our service was excellent. We even found out later on during our meal that our waiter was in training. He did an excellent job though, and no complaints from me at all in the area.  PS702 is a little on the pricy side, especially when you get drinks, but it's not out of this world crazy. With both of us getting drinks, then adding on 4 appetizers and a main entree, we only spent about $90 with tip. Besides the main chicken and waffles dish being a bit of a let down, it was well worth it, and I've got to say PS702 is one of my new favorites in Downtown Summerlin, so I can't wait to go back.",

There's books, note pads, globes and so many fun decorations. The noise level is really loud so I wouldn't recommend coming here for romance or good conversation.   We ordered some liquor and the jungle juice got me a mild buzz, thanks bartender! I love it when you can't taste it but you can definitely feel it!  We decided on their take of deviled eggs which had a kick to them. I prefer good ol traditional ones which I can't seem to find anywhere I go. Next came the margarita pizza which again had a kick & again I prefer a traditional approach. I have to comment on the nicely done thin & crispy crust which I really enjoyed. And now we get to the charcuterie board...pretty damn great! Cheese with crackers or bread and jam or honey is my thing! I can't help myself and they offered a really nice balance of mild, sweet & savory items and I enjoyed them all.   Our waitress was awesome tonight and overall we had a good time. I'm very interested in going back & trying more items.   Note - they have a very large outdoor patio area but we couldn't do it tonight because it feels like hell outside.",

Anyways enjoy and always have fun while you are out!!",

It was early, 5:00 on a Tuesday, and they couldn't seem to figure out who was supposed to be waiting on us. We plan on giving it another shot because the food was great. Beautiful space too, and fortunately it was mostly empty when we were there because I bet it gets crazy loud when it's full.",

I went to sit in the bar/patio area and watched after server upon server passed right by my group as if we didn't exist, I also saw a table next to mine being cleared by 5 employees, again not one checked in with my group. I am pretty disappointed in this as I have always recommended this place to friends and family but this will no longer be the case bad customer service ruins a reputation I hope that the employees and management of this joint realize it.",

My first attempt at an entre was a miss for me. I ordered the short ribs, fully expecting the savory childhood flavors i grew up eating but... This day and age they add \"special\" ingredients and theres the risk of throwing off your tastebuds. Thats what happened to me.  Horseradish? Who would have thunk? I dont.. Its a fail for me but you might like it. They replaced it for me, with Shrimp n Grits. First bite was an epic win, subsequent bites i found  the shrimp over cooked and the sauce fell a little flat. It was tasty enough but not perfect. My partner had the Quinoa Salad, epic HIT! She was thoroughly satisfied. We finished with the banana pudding which i call not cho mommas banana puddin.. Cuz it aint lol. It was light and airy and not too sweet. Its Grey-ish hue threw me off. It wasnt pretty and could have used more cookie.  Oh and Public School; in my humble opinion you can lose the dark chocolate shavings throughout the pudding, its overpowering. Please and thank you. Lastly the cookie, cuz we are gluttons.... was not so amazing. The ice cream was not rich nor decadent. The cookie was good, my partner liked the nutella but said the carmelized bacon was an epic miss. Her advice PBS 702... Toasted coconut... Jus sayin.  Thanks for a cool date night! But there is room to grow!",

I don't think so. We asked for water, waited,waited, wanted to order, had to \"find\" our server. Yes we saw her, standing near back, just standing. Not once did she come back to refill water or to see about our drinks. Had to ask another server to get our check for us. Waited again, finally took payment to bar as \"Katherine\" never came back. I asked the hostess to speak to manager when we were leaving, her reply \" they're busy\" . I'm an out of state guest, 2 people were Vegas residents. I will never go back, nor refer anyone to this place.",

It looks like they are going for a young crowd, with the music and noise, but attract a variety of ages.... they should consider toning it down to fit into their clientele.",

They carried the school theme out very well in the decor and it was fun. We ordered food off the happy hour and regular menu. My friend got the Parmesan fries, which were excellent, and the wings and cauliflower which she said were just ok/good. My other girlfriend ordered the poblano and quinoa. The pepper was good but the rice was very bland; almost no flavor at all. For $16- not with it. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was good, once I got it. Unfortunately, they forgot to make it so it took awhile. The good thing is they comped it, which was nice and done so without me asking.   My only complaint is the drink prices. I spent $27 on two glasses of wine. And it was nothing special, just house Chardonnay. $11/glass is outrageous for a house glass of wine. I also noticed happy hour beers were very, very limited. Regular cocktail prices were upwards of $15-$16 a piece.   Overall, it was decent. I probably won't go back unless it ends up being a meeting place decided on by others.",

I am used to both entrees coming out at the same time and the waitress not giving attitude when asked what issue occurred. Mark, the alleged manager was very nice and took our drinks off of the bill, but Kaila was noticably rude throughout the experience. Kaila is the epitome of what not to be in regards to Las Vegas industry standards. I'll no longer frequent this location again.

Our service was excellent. I know some people had issues but our server was amazing. But, as usual, there were a few cons to my experience. And truly I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could.   Cons:  Loud. Loud. Loud. If I had been with my friends having some cocktails, I wouldn't mind but being that I was with my dad, it made any lengthy conversation difficult.   Electrical outlets at the table. That's right you technology obsessed folks out there. There is an individual outlet at most tables with USB ports. I'm sure this is a huge thumbs up for most but this freaked me out and made me sad quite honestly.    Managers? There had to be at least 8 men walking around in these plaid shirts with their super important iPads and things in their hands just tapping away and meetings over here and meetings over there. I was just so random and so bizarre.  But, none of this had to do with the food or service and let's face it, that's why we go to a restaurant. So hands down, I will be back.",

The food selection doesn't seem like there are many options, but as you read through the menu there are actually quite a few.  Had the bison burger with the kale & brussels slaw.  The quality of the food combined with the taste was superb!  Pricing is very reasonable and not over priced.  Service and friendliness of staff was great!",

Our first few trips were just ok, beer selection always fantastic but food was a bit on the average side. Regardless it is always hard to score a spot at the bar.  The bartenders are always friendly and authentic super passionate beer connoisseurs (my man can sniff out a faker).  Tonight we decided to try the salmon which our bartender Conner recommended.  We usually have a policy of never ordering salmon cuz it routinely sucks.  To our delight it was TOTALLY awesome! One super cool detail we discovered; they have usb chargers at the tables and under the bar so if you're like me and run out of juice every night around 8 o'clock you're saved.  It seems 702 PS is growing up nicely and has been paying attention to the teacher's corrections ;)",

The first impression is that this is a cool place, it's decorated with a highschool motif and all the little details are incredible. Their craft beer menu is excellent, although only a few beers are available at happy hour prices and their cocktails are very reasonably priced, but also not available at happy hour prices. The food menu is one of the most unique I have seen and the chorizo mac n cheese is off the chain! Also, the service was excellent, Tyler and Mark were the kind of servers you usually only get at much more expensive establishments. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Went here for drinks with a few friends and for it being out of the way, it wasn't really worth it. As soon as you walk in, you see someone standing by the door, whom I'm going to guess is the host... but doesn't look like one, nor act like one, as we definitely seated ourselves. For drinks, we had the apple jack, guava something, and then I had asked our server to make us one more drink that doesn't taste like alcohol, but has plenty of it.. and all three of those drinks were disgusting. The ginger in the apple Jack was way to strong, and the tequila in the guava drink overpowered any other flavor in it. Also on a side note, I feel like the bartender was new because when we were watching her make our drinks, she measured literally eveeything.. and it still tasted bad. So the stars received was for the food! We had the calamari, shrimp grits, mushroom pizza and the bison burger. The calamari was delicious! Had a nice crunch and the perfect amount of seasoning, and the ginger aoili paired really good with it. We also had the shrimp grits. I don't really like grits, so I picked off a few bites of shrimp and that was tasty. I really liked the flavor and the sauce surrounding it.  We also ordered the bison burger. For never having bison before, I felt like the burger was more so plain jane. I've had much better tasting burgers for less money. It did come with fries though. Lastly, the mushroom pizza was a very good choice. You can never go wrong with mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Absolutely delicious. The only thing wrong was that my friend expressed that she didn't want any chili flakes on it, and the server insisted there were none, yet you can literally see the flakes of chili on the pizza. Even after she pointed it out, the server could care less about his & the kitchen's mistake.  After all of that, we tried to order dessert, but the kitchen was closed. Apparently we ordered the pizza 40 minutes after the kitchen closed, but what good did that do if the server didn't even tell us when last call was??? I thought that was dumb. And mostly the reason for the 2 stars. So we were able to order cookies and milk, which didn't fulfill anyone's tastebuds.. Overall, I wouldn't go back. Even if I'm shopping at downtown summerlin, there are far better bars/ places to eat at Downtown summerlin or closeby.",

    "text": "We went here for the first time last weekend and did not have a good first impression.  Pros:  * Friendly, but not very attentive, server.  * The food was amazing - highlight of the entire experience. Everything was good but the bison burger was the best part.  Cons:  * The biggest and most disturbing con was that when we sat we noticed the group of 6 near our table had a young lady completely passed out on the table - face down, not moving. The rest of the party was carrying on like it was nothing. As they had already finished their meals, who knows how long she had been like that. The server came by to give them their bill but other than that I didn't see any management or server come by to check on this obviously very intoxicated young lady or tell them they need to take her out of the restaurant. After we sat, they were there for at least another 10-15 minutes before getting up to leave. Then they asked the server for a bucket so the girl could vomit in it right there at the table for another 10 minutes before getting walked out by her \"friends\". There are so many things wrong with this and management should've intervened. * Service was very slow and they couldn't seem to handle the dinner rush. It took a long time to get our table cleaned off to sit, get our drinks, and at least 25 minutes to get our food - and the appetizer came out with the entrees. * Only a few of the outdoor heaters were actually functioning, disappointing guests. When people tried turning on the broken ones, they'd flame up for a bit, flicker, and make weird noises and freak the people out who were sitting below them.  * They were out of one of the beers on their regular menu. The server said it's been out for a very long time. * The booth we were sitting at had old painter's tape around one of the columns. When there's an obvious lack of attention to detail, it doesn't look good on the restaurant.  Overall, not a great first impression. Management was sorely lacking. The only thing that saved the place is that the food was amazing. Not sure if we'll be back; there are so many other great food places that make the guest experience a priority.",

We ordered the  deviled eggs for an appetizer, which consists of 2 eggs, split into halves. They were tasty but not worth the price they charge. The mac and cheese bites were also good, but, again, the portion size seemed better suited for smurfs. Our server seemed to enjoy taking long breaks away from our table. For the entree, we ordered the biscuits with eggs and gravy. It had enough salt to make the ocean jealous. Again, the portion was smaller than expected, especially for the price. Overall, it's ok as a gimmick for the high school decor, but it left me leaving the place hungry and broke.",

    "text": "A solid performance in service & food. For brunch we most enjoyed their bacon cheddar tots (good anytime of day!) and speck & eggs, as standard solid starters. One note on the tots- we've had spectacular tots and we've had tots with weird texture, still good, but not over the moon good.  I've had 2 brunch entrees so far and highly recommend both dishes, one light, the other is richer. First- the beet salad with arugula, I added a poached egg on top, is my fave. It's presented \"prettily\", flavorful and light. It has a delicious pomegranate dressing to top it all off. The poached egg took it up a notch! I think this is my favorite overall dish for PS702.  On the rich side was the chicken sausage & cheddar grits- lots of big flavors from grilled tomatoes, grilled corn & bacon. Get the eggs over medium and let that gooey goodness melt down into the grits. I really enjoyed the chicken sausage in the dish. It was so yummy and I had too many starters to finish but reeeaaalllyy wished I could have!! So, hint- it's fill-ing. I definitely recommend their bottomless mimosas, and they do keep them coming.  Great happy hour, lots of variety to choose from; beer and wine by the half liter & food specials. Enjoyed the buffalo crispy cauliflower the most! The buffalo sauce provides a good kick in the pants. Give the Sriracha ketchup a try with the cauliflower, I dug the combo! Overall, I've enjoyed each visit in different ways - although service has been slow (friendly but slow in refills ordering the next rounds) we are patient and will keep coming back for more.",

Normally I would probably like to see a $5-8 beer and a $7-10 cocktail, so if you're looking for that be prepared to pay a couple extra each. We took a seat at the bar as we were told it be a few min to get a seat outside on the patio even with a bunch of open seats. A little odd but it is what it is. I always like a good patio on a beautiful day but it's nice when it isn't in the desert. Had the sangria, the mezcal drink and a beer. All great options. The cauliflower appetizer and the poke appetizer were both nice little snacks with a bunch of flavor. All in all I was impressed with the options and offerings, not to mention the giant Jenga, connect four and beer pong tables, but just be prepared to spend extra cash if it isn't happy hour.",

A group of friends wanted to have a meeting here to discuss our snowboarding trip this weekend and the one who had done all the planning decided to hold the meeting here.   I'm not sure what I expected out of the place but decor/appearnace-wise, it was pretty cool. There were things that brought back nostalgia like the flashcards I used in 3rd grade hanging. The ceiling above the bar resembled the gym floor. There were globes, math problems on a chalkboard beside the \"Locker rooms\" aka bathrooms. Their menus are neat; they look like the old school composition notebooks.  The food seemed to be all, pretty unhealthy food and did not have too many items that could cater to pescetarians or vegetarians/vegans.   Very cool decor inside, although their menu left me feeling guilty inside.",

The atmosphere was really cool, almost like a high school cafeteria but very clean (really cute) the menu's are made of comprehension note books, good selection of food items..not to much, not to little, reasonable pricing. I also love the fact that theirs outlets at each booth to charge your cell and other devices.  The food was delicious, very friendly staff, the waitress ( Desiree ) was awesome, she was very knowledgeable about everything that was on the menu and suggested the best choices for us.  This is a great place for date night or night out with friends. I definitely will return!!",

Instead of pouring into another glass it was served this way. Spoke with a manager and nothing was done. Definitely will not be returning here. Not worth the money for the quality of food or service. 2 thumbs down.....",

I ordered water, they gave me a huge bottle of water. I was so exhausted from the past two weeks travels, I was dehydrated I ended up finishing the whole bottle of water by myself. (I had to drive later that night to pick up a friend so I wasn't going to order any alcohol anyway but drink menu looked nice.)  I wasn't hungry but I needed to eat at dinner time so I ordered ahi tuna poke and chorizo Mac and cheese.  Ahi tuna poke was a server's favorite and it was not what I thought it was going to be but I still enjoy it. It's far from what I had in Hawaii, nothing like it.   Chorizos Mac and cheese was way too salty for me. I really force myself to eat it as I thought I needed to put food in my stomach but I couldn't. A server asked if I wanted to take it to go but I said it was too salty to eat. It wasn't that expensive at all and I did eat about 5 bites, so I was going to pay for it but she kindly took it out my bill.  Overall it was a good experience for me, too bad I was not at my best condition to fully enjoy their restaurant.",

Sincere. Caring. Knowledgeable. Fun. Efficient. Pretty.  Her menu recommendations were spot on!  MARILYN kept our glasses full and made our tummies happy by steering us deftly though Public Schools creative menu choices!  MARILYN did not let us miss out on the delicious Mimosas, either!

Our waitress was really good. She was attentive and answered our questions and checked up on us at perfect moments, you know, not when you have food in your mouth. It was happy hour so I partook in a refreshing beer called All Day, I believe that's the name. She suggested it and it was delicious. Our appetizer was the Fiery Calamari, which was perfect in spice and the side dip was good. Our dinners were the fish and chips, fish tacos, and chicken tacos. The fish that was given for the fish and chips was the same on the fish tacos. The pieces were generous but on a taco was a bit too big but still able to grasp it and enjoy it. However, the batter of the cod could of used a bit more flavor, it was quite bland. The sweet potato fries were hot and so delish but the other 2 set of regular fries were cold so we sent it back. The waitress apologized and got us a fresh hot set. We left pretty satisfied but a bit disappointed. Again the theme is nice but the food was just okay.",

The Deviled Eggs were nothing special and i thin my husband makes way better deviled eggs. They didn't have anything special to them that made them stand out at all. The Cast Iron Chicken was beautiful! It had lots of colors and flavors. I don't love polenta but it the dish sounded so good I had to try it. It wasn't my favorite due to the polenta but besides that it was good. The PB&J Burger was amazing! It was a great combo of not just flavors but texture too. We always share dishes so I don't know if I could eat the whole thing but the few bites I had I truly enjoyed. The fries were great and the spicy ketchup was a good surprise. Overall we enjoyed Public School and want to go back to try more things.",

Last year I made Elite Yelper not because of how many business I have checked in or photos I've posted but , because of my honestly an discreet detail.  Now I haven't had time to Yelp I've just been occupied with other things in life so my badge is gone but , my attitude an opinions are still here.  We have the fish tacos , steak an frites, buffalo cauliflower and, mac n cheese with chorizo,   Idk what happened in the kitchen how the cleanliness of it is or how anything was handled but I'm completely an utterly disappointed I have some sort of food poisoning virus I've chucked up twice my body is sore I have a fever an this restaurant is the only place I went to eat yesterday I never get sick it's been years since I have anything wrong with me an this place was greasy the fries were stale the pasta tasted like a Gallon of vinegar was poured into it the steak I had ordered was border line raw I asked for medium the fish racks were all batter no fish   Point being I will never go back to get sick again what a complete waste of money... 70$ for a food virus I'm stuck with now for a few days.. So pissed!!   I wish I could give them a 0 star rating...",

It's located close to the ball park and a part of an outdoor shopping center.  The place is decorated with school related decor.  It has a great patio(it was hot and we sat inside).  We went during happy hour (a nice surprise). The beer on draft was cold and delicious.  We ordered a few things off the app menu and shared.  The bacon tator tots were yummy!  The flatbreads were very flavorful.  The peppers on the flatbread were spicy and a perfect addition to the meal!  We had great service also.  It was one of our favorite places we visited during our stay!",

    "text": "Downtown Summerlin is an exciting experience with multiple entertainment experiences. However recently we've seen a few restaurants leave and are seeing less unique opportunities for dining, so we decided to give Public School 702 a try, here is my thoughts   Atmosphere - The decor is pretty amazing with their old school decorations an modern touches. There is a bar area, dining area as well as outside dining options. Most of the tables have power and USB supply to recharge devices (since I'm a geek, I see this as a plus). I really like the outside dining, very comfortable upbeat fun area.  Food - OK so they have these tater tots that are amazing!!!!!!!! Their happy hour menu is great. TIP 1 - there are some mini sliders they serve that I swear taste like In and Out cheeseburgers. The flavor of all their food is very good and I would consider it a cross between light fare to gastro pub.  Service - We have yet to experience any bad service. The staff really has a laid back feeling about them and even when they are busy, you wouldn't know it. We have not had the same wait staff twice but have never had a issue.   I am not much of a drinker but feel the one or two cocktails I've had have been really good and pretty much properly mixed.  Conclusion is simple, great place to chill, play some Jenga or connect 4",

Drinks took 30 plus minutes to get out.  Tequila strawberry Sunrise nothing special nothing blended.  Probably the most disgusting spirit drink we have all had. Looked nothing like the picture and tasted nothing like a tequila strawberry sunrise. First time there and none of us will go back.   update, Kevin reached out from Public School .

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend were on our way to Blue Ribbon chicken in Summerlin Downtown and turns out the owners closed this location to focus on the other locations on the strip.  We started to walk around  see what else is there to eat at the Summerlin downtown and decided to try Public School.  Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess (who wore a yellow crop top and a perfect bun) and we told her its our first time. She told us to hold on because she had to take the phone call and we waited a considerable amount of time and she did not apologize for us waiting.  After she hung the phone, we said for 2 and that we wanted to sit outside in the shade since it was nice out on 9/22. So we explored our options and walking and trying to choose our seats out side. All the seats look like it was all \" stained.\" So we opted on just staying inside instead.  Mind you the place was scattered empty and no long lines at the hostess desk. It took 10 min to sit down and another 15 min for our waiter to greet us at our table.    Finally, our waiter greeted us and said he will be back with our water. He came back with water and ask us if we had any questions about the menu. So I end up ordering the Colorado Lamb burger with truffle fries on the side and my boyfriend ordered corn beef hash and eggs and a side of silver dollar pancakes..Once our food was brought our we had to ask for utensils, asked for syrup. Our waiter was a bit chatty and felt he was not very attentive to our needs. He did not have the intuitiveness of what a customer needs.  Once the food came out my lamb burger was good but my truffle fries were not hot. The corn beef hash was a bit too salty.  Overall the operation of the place is lacking and it was not busy which customer service could have been more attention to detail such as he did not give us utensils or even ask what else we needed.    To management, I highly suggest changing out the patio cushion seats or changing the fabric and retrain your young host on how to prioritize when she is trying to multitask.",

One of the drinks we ordered came out wrong and when we told the waitress she replied \"nope that's yours\" and then came back and said \"I think you were right I dropped off the wrong drink\"...we know.  First rule of customer service, \"THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!\"  Second and third time, I came to recess aka happy hour. The service was awesome, but once again the food was just mediocre.

For a beginner in beers, it was delicious! Food was amazing! So full and definitely taking everything home. We had the crispy buffalo cauliflower, Chorizo Mac and Cheese, Naked Wings and French Fries. Did you know they make all their sauces IN HOUSE?! Lastly we finished with a gigantic Nutella cookie sandwich that has a bacon brittle (which we got on the side). Nothing was left to be desired!

When given the chance to dine here on Wednesday, I jumped at the chance to have dinner at the cool spot perched on the second floor of the \"Dining Arroyo\" at my favorite shopping center in Vegas. Although Public School did provide a unique, modern dining/lounge option with great views, the service and menu fell short of my expectations.  Upon arriving, we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. The decor is modern and hip and I was excited about the experience. The server took a while to greet us (I saw him and another server arguing who was taking our table), but when he arrived, was friendly. We ordered a couple of beers and the Hummus as an appetizer.  The Hummus was excellent, with fried chick peas on top And served with excellent grilled flatbread.  For Dinner I ordered the Thai noodle salad and he ordered shrimp and grits. Although I was looking for a cold noodle salad, this one fell short. There was a lot of dressing and the ingredients were just ok. To be fair, the shrimp and grits were supposedly excellent.  The beer was also ok, mine being a little hoppy and his not matching his favorite ciders he usually orders.  My gripe with this place is it seems to want to be pretentious and have an elevated menu, but the staff seems unmotivated to convey these ideas to The guest. I would have loved a better recommendation for my beverage or maybe some ideas on special and unique menu options. Instead, we were asked if we were ready to order and if we wanted dessert, which is cool unless your intentions are to provide a more chef driven casual menu.  P.S. There is nothing worse than opening a menu after arriving at your table and it being stuck together with food and whatever else. This is a particular annoyance at a supposed upscale-casual restaurant with the prices to match.. just saying..",

    "text": "I came here on a Wednesday night after watching a movie. This perhaps is my second or third time here at Downtown Summerlin. (I just recently moved to the northwest of town from the south side. It's definitely a much better atmosphere here. )  Back to what matters, the drinks definitely seemed more appealing than the food menu. Most options have bacon bits and being that I don't eat pork made it annoying. I ended up getting the Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower and Irish Stout Braised Short Rib to share. I definitely recommended both to try!!  It full of flavor and a great portion size.   Im really big on customer service and as a new spot I definitely feel like the staff our waitress in particular wasn't very attentive to discussing what was best to try and lacked knowledge of the menu. It took her 20 minutes for our check.   Overall it was cool and might visit again for the patio experience.",

They had the hostess at the front, and looking straight down at her tablet for their seating. We had to approach her in order to initiate any kind of conversation.  Service after we sat down was ok. Just make sure to get order what you need when you see the server, it takes a minute for them to get to you.  Food: I read a review below that indicated nothing really stood out. I agree with that review. Nothing really stood out, which is not necessarily bad, but also not good. Restaurants need a specific dish or two to stand out and make guests think, \"I want to go there again!\"   Watermelon tomato appetizer was mediocre. I've been to places that were able to use a balsamic dressing to complement the sweetness of watermelons perfectly. Here, I believe they are trying to do too much with the dressing. The yellow tomato was kind of confusing. The first piece my girlfriend and I had were bland, the second piece on the bottom had more flavor.   Charcuterie board was nothing really special. I would prefer to go down the street to hearthstone for a better selection.  Chicken and waffles was also missing something. Perhaps the thick cut bacon is what never does it for me. I'm more a crispy bacon kind of person. That bacon made the gravy really chunky, and not as appealing as it could have been. The corn bread waffle could have use an extra minute in the waffle iron. They serve the chicken on top of the waffle, and slightly covered in the gravy, and an extra side of that same gravy. I would recommend getting that gravy on the side so that your fried chicken doesn't get soggy.",

Passion fruit mojito tastes really refreshing. And I forgot the name but the coffee  cocktail they have was good and strong. The food however, was mehhhh. The ahi poke was decent with the passion fruit sauce in there but the fish didn't taste fresh. Now on to the entree. I got fish and chips and wow, the inside was less barely warm and there was wayyyy too much batter. I ended up just eating the fish on the inside and left out the batter. Fries could be crispier. They were too soggy in my opinion. Definitely ask for the bbq honey sauce to dip your fries in. All in all, I would come back here just for drinks and maybe some bar food during happy hour. I don't think their entrees are worth the $$$.",

    "text": "I struggled with giving this three star review knowing that I should probably be giving them two. So I planned a brunch date with my girlfriend here this past Sunday because we were looking for a place we both never have been and somewhere that offered some bottomless mimosa's! Now knowing that Sunday Brunch times can always be so busy I went ahead and booked a reservation through YELP including in the notes that the outdoor seating on the balcony would be preferred. Once we arrived we were told that they don't guarantee the outdoor seating and that it's first come first served. Initially we were told they didn't have anything available and then the girl comes back and says that they did but it was in the sun. We said sure let's try and see if this is going to work and it didn't so we moved back inside. Once we were seated we were greeted by a very nice waiter who was new and did the best he could. He disclosed multiple times that they were really backed up and that the service may seem slow. I went with the bottomless mimosa option and here I guess they offer it to where you can either have it with beer (yuck!) or the traditional way which is orange juice. I asked for orange juice to only receive the exact opposite which was beer! To add insult to injury I was already annoyed that I had to wait almost 15 minutes for my drink I just was completely over the entire situation quite frankly. Our food took forever which was a simple eggs benedict pizza and the smothered breakfast burrito! My burrito was TRASH I cut into it to only find that the hash browns were all burnt and the egg was hard. Gotta be kdding me? The appetizer's came out AFTER the main course which was another strike. It was just an entire train wreck that I could go on and on about but I wasn't happy at all about this being my first visit. I must've caught them on a off day because the entire experience was ridiculous. The waiter was so nice and I felt bad he was new and had no control that's the only reason they are getting the 3 stars and not 2.",

Few minutes later, a tall gentleman with a mustache who probably work in the kitchen area came outside with frozen blueberries.

We had to wait a couple times to order & there were dirty plates in front of us a bit too long. It wasn't super busy, just an average crowd. Our interaction with the bartenders was good.

There were not that many food options (just one side of one page of a menu) and the prices were a little higher than I was expecting. The service was not that great either, as we rarely saw our waitress.  The theme of the restaurant is well coordinated, so that I appreciated. You are in for menus that look like composition books, and napkins that look like lined paper, along with a variety of other cool themed decorations. The hummus plate we ordered was very good, but the cocktails we ordered were terrible. I couldn't even drink mine, and felt bad that I had paid so much for something I didn't enjoy.   We were having such a bad time that we left after appetizers, so the food may have been amazing. However, the atmosphere and limited variety of meal options turned us off.

After we were finished, our waiter Julian comes over with our checks. We noticed that some of our drinks were at happy hour price, but the food was not. Except for one person in our party. Hers was discounted to happy hour price, for her food AND drinks.  So, we call him over and say, I thought it was supposed to be half price after 9? He says, oh no, that's only when you sit in the bar area... Oh really? Hmm... If that was True, why did ONE of us get the happy hour price, and no one else? And where does it state that on the menu?? It doesn't.  He tells us that he has to go tell the manager, and he would fix it this ONE time, but next time we would have to sit in the bar area.

Happy hour has more of a variety and priced very well!  I wouldn't suggest bringing kids since it's more of a bar scene. Also when I went to visit it was more on the quiet side so no one was sitting in the main dining room.",

They said it would be 20 min but it took about 10 so that was great. The patio has a really nice look and feel! I was excited!  Then we get to the bad: the service. It took the server about 10-15 min to come take our drink order, took even longer to actually get the drinks. The water she said she'd bring didn't come until we asked for it again halfway through our meal.  We ordered a cheese plate which was delicious and the drinks were just as good. Too bad it would take forever every time we ordered a round. It took even longer to get our check and what seemed like an eternity to get our cards back to sign.  With so many other options to chose from, why go back to a place where they don't respect their customers enough to provide efficient service?",

Two little kids came over from the restaurant side and wanted to play. We told them no and that kids aren't allowed in the bet area. They came back again and we told them no again at which point they went back to their mother and said we were mean and she started yelling. At this point there are so many things wrong with this situation. First ITS A BAR! you shouldn't want your kids playing with \"mean people\" in bars or in a bar period. The worst part is that at no time did a manager come over or anyone to rectify the situation. One of the waitresses told the kids it was ok for them to play , the bartender said no an argument ensued with no manager in sight and no offer to make things right. What the hell? If you want to drink and relax like an adult go somewhere else",

Decent variety of drink and appetizer specials, with enough that should cover everyone's tastes.  Bartenders were very knowledgeable and very friendly, even though it was PACKED.  Dinner, things just got better, we tried the fried Coli-flour, as has been reviewed here many times.  It was really good, but what outdid it was the bacon cheddar tater tots.  YUM!  For my main, I had Bangers and Mash.  Really good, the sausages were excellent, though not quite True to the English form of B&M, but still VERY good.  My wife had the Roasted Pablano, she's not a vegetarian, but  it would have worked, and it was delicious to boot!  Our friend had the Short Rib, which he reported was out of this world good.  His wife had the Shrimp and White Cheddar grits.  Best grits I've ever tried.  Just wish there was more than 5 stars to really make this place stand out even more.  We will be back for sure!!",

This is the 3rd time service has been slow but the worst part of it is that the servers kept propping the door open and it was cold outside with a breeze.  The customer across from us asked them to close the door.  It was closed for a minute until it was propped open again by another server.  After the 4th time the door was propped open I asked for a manager.  15 minutes later, he never came.  While we were addressing the issue, another customer walked up to the server at our table and asked for the door to be closed.  We explained our experience so she asked the server to point out the manager and she walked into the kitchen area to speak to him and he asked one of the same servers to shut the door.  Our server wrote on the receipt that the next time we come in, her manager who wasn't there would give us a free appetizer.  In other words, the manager on duty didn't care about the customers at all and didn't offer anything or take the time to come over and address the issue that all the customers in our area were complaining how cold it was.  At least the people outside had heaters.  Needless to say, I'm never going there again.",

I ordered a classic burger and a \"slaw\" in place of fries, however it was  coated heavily in what tasted like a caesar parmesan cream sauce.  it was so heavy and the flavor so overpowering, i sent back, and requested their quinoa side.  Much better.  Server accommodated the request no problem.   Beers on tap $8 each- again, pricey.  We were seated near the outdoor patio, in what seemed like a huge open space, felt very barren, and lacked feelings of warmth.  On the way out, i saw bar area, and that section appeared more intimate and lively.  Unfortunately, menu was not exciting enough for me to return.",

The outside sitting area is really chill and there were a ton of people having happy hour drinks. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink waiting at the bar. Bartenders just didn't seem to have any sense of urgency. Beer pong was fun, but you have to drink their house pilsner which is the worst. You have no option to change or upgrade/downgrade your beer. Because of that, we only played one game and high tailed it out to Red Rock for some gambling.",

    "text": "My husband & I decided to check out this somewhat newer restaurant at Downtown Summerlin tonight. We were given the option of sitting inside or outside & decided that since the seating was in the shade we'd take outside. The table arrangements are lovely with fans blowing the air so it didn't feel so warm (it is Vegas in July you know!) There were a lot of tables but not so many that you felt you were sitting on your neighbor. I must add that the inside was decorated really neat! There were quite a few colored, lighted globes hanging from the ceiling which we LOVED! It did seem awfully loud inside with voices so I'm really glad we chose outside!   We were immediately greeted by Grace who offered recommendations of their cocktails & wines. I'm impressed that she knew both so well. I ended up getting the chardonnay that she recommended (unfortunately I cannot remember the winery but it was the higher priced of the 2) & it was perfect! I love a chardonnay with butter under tones & this one had it! My husband got the Crushed Velvet which was incredibly delicious! She also gave a couple appetizer recommendations & we order the meat & cheese platter which was truly devine! The prosciutto was thinly sliced & not at all fatty & the salami was yummy! The cheeses & couple of condiments were great compliments to the meat. I especially liked that the toast was thinly sliced & toasted making it easy to bite into.   We had a second server, Vanessa, assist us who was equally knowledgeable & attentive. I must say that it is wonderful to have servers who have actually tried the food & drinks & can give you their opinion. My husband ordered the short ribs & I the shrimp with cheddar cheese grits. Both were highly recommended by both servers & they did not disappoint! My shrimp dish was full of shrimp & vegetables as well as flavor! I ended up ordering a glass of the granache. While it was a very delicious wine, I would go with one with a bit more kick next time as this dish was full of flavor,  not what I was expecting. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his short ribs & said the mashed potatoes were really good with a hint of horseradish & small pieces of potato in it.  We had just enough attention by Vanessa throughout our meal but not too much that we felt rushed. We will definitely return to try something new! And to think that initially I wasn't so excited about the menu. Boy, my mind was changed!",

We decided to start with the calamari appetizer but told our server we are not fans of mayo based sauces. She told the chef and he sent out three different sauces with our calamari that all tasted amazing. Roos to the chef for being accommodating. I had the chicken sausage and grits and my wife had the roasted veggie and hash with tostadas and Adobe sauce. The grits were super creamy and the cheesy sauce and vegetables were a fantastic texture variance that made the dish so good. The roasted veggie hash had a great freshness and subtle earthy favors that were enchanted brilliantly with the Adobe sauce. We will most definitely be back.",

They had a great beer selection, but charged about double what any other place in town charges for premium beers in a bottle.  Not many beers to choose from for their cheaper beers.  The menu was very limited and expensive.  Cheapest burger was $13 and then only a couple to choose from. We ate in the bar which was mainly a sports bar.  3 different TVs going.  Very noisy. Service was good and the food was ok.  I will only go back because I have a little more left on the gift certificate, but when that is done, I won't be back.",

    "text": "After shopping around all day, I was looking for a quick bite to eat. I've heard a lot of cool things about this place so decided to give it a try. We walked in and we were told its happy hour. Score!  Happy hour is Monday-Thursday 3:30-6:30. Happy hour isn't everywhere but just at the bar or in the bar area. We originally sat a lot a table in the middle of the bar but moved over to a booth once it was cleaned. The food was pretty good, the service was just ok. Our server didn't say more than 10 words to us the whole hour and a half we were there. I understand it was happy hour but when we got there, it didn't look too terribly busy?? She didn't ask why we switched tables. She didn't ask if the food was tasting ok. She said the most when she dropped off the tab.   Pros: chargers under the bar, happy hour prices, and at each table by the bar area, laid back cool atmosphere, menus are composition notebooks, super clever! They do have wifi, cute little bookshelves, math cards all around to really make it feel like a school atmosphere, outdoor seating looking over downtown summerlin, the outdoor seating has fans everywhere.. Also a life size connect four   Cons: waitress did seem like she was in a huge hurry when we first sat down, despite the restaurant not looking busy   Tip*** wifi name is under public school and the password is public school  Happy hour food: I highly recommend the ahi poke, it was delicious!! Also the fried cauliflower with buffalo sauce was very good. And the red quinoa salad was my personal favorite.   Would I go back? Overall I would go back to try some more things. The food was pretty good. The service was a bit lacking to me but I would go again",

It's because of what I saw at the bar. A patron ordered a drink that required a large ice cube. These cubes are made by hand in a silicone tray. They are removed by hand; literally.   I watched the bartender use his unwashed fingers to place the cube in a glass and then prepare the drink. What's more is he handled other people's dirty glassware and not from the stems. At no time did I see him wash is hands. In fact he was moving glassware from the rinse sinks to the dishwasher, then handling tickets, food plates and drinks without washing in between. It's disgusting!   It might be time to call the health department.  PS - Their service is slow.",

I was pleasantly surprised to enter a bustling mid afternoon lunch crowd with music blarring.    After browsing the menu and being informed of the $4 brunch beer specials. I decided I will take TWO! Start off with a Duvel Belgium brew which was good. More of a lager than my preference of IPA but still a tasty brew. Round two was a Live Free or Die! Brew from SF which satisfied my hoppy taste buds.    For eats I went with the CCB.  A chicken burger with avocado, thick bacon, red onion, blue cheese aioli, bib lettuce, tomato jam and a fried egg over med.  Eggs on sandwiches means egg all over everything especially your hands. I did my best impression of Guy Fieri wirh my elbows up to not end up wearing this mountain of a burger.  The unique combination of ingredients definitely made this a tasty \"sammy\". You have been warned though it is messy. I felt bad destroying the fine white linen napkins with my messy hands and face.  The fires on the side were a perfect crispy golden brown and seasoned appropriately.  I like the natural cut with the skins still in play.  The sirracha ketchup on the side was perfectly balanced and not too spicy to kill the flavor. Nicely done indeed.   Overall great visit. I cannot wait to come back in the fall to enjoy the 2nd level outdoor patio seating.",

Our menus looked like a composition note book and the specials for brunch were on a scan-tron set up menu. I thought it was really clever and liked the concept.  You can sit inside or outside but since it was summertime in Las Vegas we sat inside.   The chairs were a little uncomfortable but overall not bad.   I decided to get bottomless bloody marys. They were only $10 which I thought was a great price. I could only get two though because it was so spicy and I started to get heart burn. Next time I'd try the bottomless mimosas instead so I wouldn't get heartburn.   We started with the deviled eggs. They used a chipotle sauce which made them taste amazing! I highly recommend them.  I then got the veggie pizza. I should have shared it with someone because it wasn't personal sized. It tasted really good! It had goat cheese on it so I knew it would. Its a white based pizza as well which was a nice change of pace.  Our waiter was really friendly and knowledgeable. I would visit this place again.",

Manager comes over and says hey I hear your order was not right the first time I took care of that for you. Along with that here is an appetizer for next time. So sorry that happened.

It's a pretty neat concept!  Everything my party ordered my delicious! I was here for a company meeting, which our vendor said they'd cover the bill. So, she was nice enough to order pretty much half the menu! Score!!! =)  The appetizers were so good & tasty! The Buffalo Cauliflower, then the Speck & Eggs, to the Chorizo Mac & Cheese, then the Bacon Cheddar Tots, to the Ahi Tacos... I was so full from trying everything, I couldn't even eat my entree! I must say, though, the Ahi Tacos were bland for me, which I was very bummed about since Ahi Poke is my fav. Nonetheless, everything else was good.  I then went straight to dessert & we ordered the Nutella Cookie Sandwich, and also the Lemon Meringue Pie in a jar. The lemon meringue was way too sour for me, but I enjoyed the Nutella cookie very much!  I also ordered the Guavalajara cocktail, and that, too, was delicious.  I'd definitely come back here!",

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower and the truffle frites and they were bomb! I always get nervous ordering cauliflower because I live in fear that they'll be soggy, but it came out really crispy and flavorful. If I come back here (I don't live in Vegas), I will definitely get those again.   Though the food was delicious, the service was really slow. I recommend ordering everything at once, so you're not sitting and waiting for them to come around again.   The fun stuff about this place:  - The theme! The menu comes on mock notebooks, the brunch menu on scantrons (if you have test anxiety, beware), the bar ceiling is designed to look like a gym floor, and there are math cards hanging from clips on the ceiling.  - They have tv screens everywhere, so if you're looking for a place to watch a game, head on over! - Bottomless drinks for $15: beermosas, mimosas, micheladas, and bloody marys",

They messed up my truffle fries order and gave me sweet potato fries instead, but I'm not complaining cause the sweet potato ones were SOOOO much better than their truffle fries. Their Brussels sprouts were pretty good, but their quinoa salad wasn't my favorite. It wasn't as flavorful as I would've liked. Their brownie dessert was MMMMMMMMM. I finished it in .5 seconds no cap. That summed it up.",

The wings are ok, but the sauce is served on the side and the wings them self have no seasoning or flavor. The chorizo Mac n cheese was pretty good, they chorizo doesn't have any flavor but the salt & vinegar chips are a nice and different addition. The flatbreads are not good! They remind me of the cheap flatbreads that I used to get in elementary school for $2 with no cheese and way too much sauce.

FYI Impossible's website has a map of the restaraunts serving their Impossible Burgers when you use your location.  The Impossible Burger is new on their menu and has been selling very well. They have plenty of other vegan options but The Impossible was amazing. It comes with great toppings and a choice of side. We ordered 2 plus their hummus & buffalo cauliflower and had an amazing meal.  This restaraunt has a wonderful environment and great service. Their patio is large and dog friendly and the inside is lively. Check them out and their happy hour too!",

I've never seen a restaurant in downtown Summerlin be so calm--this was a nice break.  We skipped over appetizers and went straight into entrees. I ordered the fish and chips and had no major complaints. I wasn't a fan of the sriracha ketchup, but the waitress happily swapped it for regular ketchup. It paired well with the hard apple cider, which was crisp and refreshing.  Did I mention the location? I love downtown Summerlin! The interior ambiance was very fun and comfortable as well.

They have some games.   the fish tocos - so yum  Buffalo cauliflower - omg so good  Wings - great  Burger- good  Fries- always good   The food came out pretty fast and everyone that worked here was also great.   Ps It's great for groups! Birthday!",

    "text": "This place has been around since DT Summerlin made its debut and I was hesitant about checking it out because I didn't like the happy hour menu.  BUT a friend recently said let's meet up there so I thought we'd give it a try for  their regular menu.  Well when I got there I was pleasantly surprised about their items on the happy hour menu that I put their regular menu aside.    Their happy hour menu had some nice selections of items (all featured below in pictures). From 2 x 2 sliders to mini steak tacos there's something for everyone on the menu.  Their cider on tap was great.  Both my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed them.   I'd say the only drawback was the prices on the individual items on their happy hour menu.  In my opinion for what you got they were a little high.  That doesn't take away from the taste or the presentation at all.  Just the individual price during a happy should be a little lower.  Thanks Public School 702, will be back for another meal.",

When I finally got to looking over the menu, nothing really jumped out at me.   My friend and I shared the deviled eggs which I hate when apps are uneven numbers because then you fight over sharing that final piece lol. I settled for a salad and asked for oil and vinegar and the bartender had mentioned she wasn't sure if they could and proceeded to let me know that they had to look for vinegar. I mean I didn't want basic white, but I would've settled for even red wine. Just seemed odd that I didn't get my food sooner because they couldn't find vinegar.   I don't really live close by so there's a good chance I won't be back anytime soon unless someone asked me to.",

They had some good kids meal options and crayons for the girls which is always a plus now a days as well as booths.  The ambience was cool and went with the background music.  I wish I could of enjoyed the happy hour prices but it was only in the bar area.   I ordered a sangria which comes in a very nice presentation and the taste was good. I could not decide on my food choice and ended up getting a burger which was ok but unmentionable obviously since I dont remember which one. I went back and forth between what I got, the PB and J burger, fish and chips, and the mac and cheese. I saw the mac and cheese at another table and it looked very good. My girls meals came with some so of course I tried it and it was delish.  Im not sure if the kids mac and cheese is exactly the same as thd appetizer one but Im sure its pretty close.   Definitely getting that next time, or the PB and J burger. Lol.",

Today we went for a family lunch, my husband got the peanut butter and jelly burger and sweet potato fries. He said it tasted exactly as he anticipated. I got the crispy Fish tacos and a side of chorizo Mack and cheese. The fish tacos were very good, perfectly flaky and golden brown. The chorizo mac & cheese was good, but I didn't really feel like a Mack and cheese. It was more like an Alfredo sauce and flavor and texture. However, there was kale in it. And I have never enjoyed eating kale, but it was really good in the pasta! For dessert we got the old-school brownie to share. The crunchy coating and sauce on the ice cream is good, and the brownie was dense and fudgy. All in all, we had a great experience!",

    "text": "OK so usual set up we're going to be looking at ambiance, service, and food. Let's get to it!  Ambiance: The interior was interesting. It was low lit and spacious. The had a lot of decor that was chalk based which I thought was really clever with their theme. Their menus were a play on a  normal composition book and their napkins had a print that made it look like note paper. Personally I liked how clever there decor was for their theme. On their balcony, they even had giant Jenga, cards to play with, and giant connect four definitely a fun place but caters to adults.   Service: The service was good. We were seated fairly quickly but I will admit our waitress was a bit lacking. She didn't come to check on us to much. We actually had another waiter deliver our water to us and we actually asked him questions about the food. He was very knowledgeable and assisted greatly in our decisions.   Food: So I got to try the BBQ bison burger and the PB&J burger. The bison burger was cooked well and it was messy which I never mind. The BBQ sauce with the arugula, mushrooms, and bacon lardons I admit it was pretty good. The PB&J was fairly good as well. My sister isn't able to take spicy and she is very sensitive to heat but our waiter gave her a bit of the habanero jam to test out. She enjoyed the burger because with everything in it the heat wasn't that noticeable. Overall, food was good. I'm curious to try more on the menu.",

When we first arrived, we were given a run down of what Public School is and why their menu is special. A few of us ordered the bottomless, kinda, drinks.   There were four drinks to choose from, a bloody mary, michelada, mimosa and one other type of drink. You could mix and match up to four drinks. I started with a Bloody Mary. It was delicious but definitely different. The initial taste had a huge cocktail sauce horseradish taste. I had to mix it up every time I took a sip but they were good, just heavy handed on the horseradish. I ordered my mimosas next and suck with those throughout brunch.   I ordered the Ruben, a favorite sandwich of mine, and asked them to put it on different bread because...Rye. yuck! My girlfriend and a friend ordered the fish and chips, our other friend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. he bison burger and biscuits and gravy were also ordered. My sandwich was delicious, perfect portions of meat and sauerkraut. The bun was good but very buttery.   My girlfriend really liked the fish and chips as well, the plate was empty when she was done.  Everyone seemed to like their meals, no one had any complaints about anything. I consider that a pretty good success.   Once we were done eating, and drinking, we made our way outside to the large jenga and played a few games. That was fun for sure. We had a good time and enjoyed the food. I recommend Public School for sure.",

Omg... it's now my favorite food ever!!! I didn't see if on the menu but it was there at the function out here on the patio. Oh, I'll be back very soon and find out what it really was and let you know!! But maybe just ask about it until then... it was AMAZING!!! Highly recommend!

The dips were ok, dont think ill order again.  For my entree I had the kale Caesar salad.  Didnt love seeing 2 sardines staring at me when they sat the salad in front of me, but I scooted them to the side.  It was a good amount of salad, but again not sure id order it again.  Id like to go back and try some other options....ill keep you posted.",

Hubby got the crispy chicken sandwich w/kale salad. If you like blue cheese, get the salad. If not, it overpowers the salad. Hubby's sandwich had a decent spicy flavor to it, but it was nothing special. Also tried ahi tuna tacos to start. The dressing was nice and tart, but I would prefer it on a salad, not to flavor ahi. The ahi itself, being raw was a bit fishy w/no flavor other than its fishiness.  I like Downtown Summerlin, but Im not interested in coming back to Public School 702.",

    "text": "I went for an alumni happy hour event on 8/27 and was pleasantly surprised at how packed the place was for it being 5:30 pm on a Thursday. Thy didn't have much signage on the ground level so it took me a minute to find from the backside of the mall, but that's an easy fix. I enjoyed their flat breads and crispy tater tots with spicy ketchup. The service was definitely spotty, we had a sassy waitress that at one point told us - \"sorry, we are not taking drink orders right now, the bar is too busy.\" I thought that was pretty interesting since we were at a BAR, a place that most likely relies on a huge portion of revenue from their bar sales. So I told her, damn you guys must not want to make money. So she unhappily said she would put our drink orders in and low and behold my beer came out within 2 minutes. The 3 hours I was there, I was able to barely get two drinks from our server who only asked if I needed anything else at the end of the night when the place cleared. I won't judge this place on the bad service though because I have heard good things and will definitely return just maybe when they are not too busy to serve me a drink.",

    "text": "LOVE this place after 2 brunch visits. I wonder if their dinner is bad since, honestly, brunch is SO GOOD here.   Ambiance: 5/5 casual, trendy, with a fun, public school theme. space is large, which is nice since they were able to easily accommodate our huge (10ppl) group on short notice.   Service: 4/5 friendly, but can get a bit slow at times.  Food:  -Chorizo Mac & Cheese: 5/5 SO GOOD. Creamy, savory, yummy, goodness. Scrape the bottom of the plate goodness. Also excellent value. I'd just get this as  meal. -Bacon Tater Tots: 5/5 Also very yummy. crispy on the out side buttery flaky on the inside. SO GOOD. -Speck & Eggs: 3/5 Good but not out of the ordinary. -Fried Jidori Chicken and Green Chili Cornbread Waffles: 5/5 Delicious chicken, perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Waffle was maybe not the typical texture but you have to remember it's cornbread. Still very good. Also, HUGE portion. -Stuffed French Toast: 5/5 Very good. Sweet but not overly sweet. -Shrimp and Grits: 5/5 Perhaps the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. the grits didn't come in a bowl of mush, but rather in something like a grit cake--a little crunch on the outside and creamy on the inside.  -Almost bottomless Mimosa: 2/5 it's fine but mimosa is a mimosa. Nothing special. and definitely loses out to the bloody mary. -Almost bottomless bloody mary: 10/5 OMG. it came with a pickled garlic and a...chicken wing. NO JOKE. Solid spicy kick, and not too sweet. I swear next time I'm just coming to get bottomless bloody mary. That's 4 bloody marys and 4 chicken wings. for $10. What more can you ask for in a brunch? Amazeballs.",

Being a beer lover, I was stoked about their selection of craft beers on tap. My server Colby (like the cheese, lol) was very knowledgable about the food and drinks and sold me a Dawn of the Red brew that I really loved while I chowed down on ahi wanton tacos--also delicious. I would have never considered putting ahi in a crispy wonton but it was magic. Despite the fact that I'm a beer loyalist, they had such an interesting selection of craft cocktails I had to indulge while I was finishing up my meal. Colby said that the crushed velvet was very popular so I gave it a try. Nice refreshing take on a Moscow mule. The fresh lavender was nice touch. I can't wait to go back and work my way through their great tap selection, and I'll definitely ask for Colby's section because I've never had such great service at a casual concept.",

The music was so loud we could hardly carry on a conversation, we had to yell our orders to the waiter, and we couldn't hear anything he said about the specials. The tables are incredibly close together so as to be uncomfortable. The grown ups at the table next to us were throwing coins at each other and nobody told them to knock it off besides another table of customers, with their glares, who were on the receiving end of some of those coins. Our waiter was great about refilling our waters in the beginning but didn't pay us as much attention as he should have during our meal. Cool decor, though. And maybe a visit for lunch would be better. Stay away on a Friday night.",

Took our server 5 min to come get our drink order, even though he was standing 2 feet away, chatting with the other servers the whole time. Plus, the restaurant wasn't very busy. (Management should probably send people home when you have a group of 5 or so standing by the bar chatting the whole time we were there.) I'd probably go back to try some other dishes cause the food was good, but rude employees really deter me from returning to a place.",

I ended up getting a Jack and coke and the bartender filled up the portion shot and ran out of Jack while it was half filled and didn't bother opening a new bottle it was strictly coke. We sat down and received water out of a vase to distribute out for the table ourselves. After we received our second bottle we noticed a lot of food floating around in the bottle. We had already drank half of the bottle! We brought it up to the server and he responded let me get you another one. We expressed our disgust with what had happened and he said he would talk to his manager. Once he returned with a clean bottle we asked what the manager said and he responded with \"he didn't say much\". We were appalled! The manager then finally came by and asked \"what would you like me to do?\" It was like pulling teeth for good service. The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because they took 20% off the bill. Over all the food was OK and the menu was confusing the entire table ordered the same thing. Be careful.",

Our party of 8 was seated promptly but it was 15 minutes before our server approached and took drink orders. 15 minutes later, (most of) our drink orders arrived (since they were out of what I ordered, I had to wait another 5 minutes).  The menu had some interesting items but was overall meh, and food took forever to arrive. Some in our party commented on the plates that had been sitting under the heat lamps forever, turns out, it was ours. Fish and chips sat easily for 20 minutes so the fries were soggy as one could imagine. My buddy asked for more ketchup, never arrived. We ordered an extra round of drinks and after 10 minutes, same friend went out to the bar to get them himself. While there, he ran into our server, which was a little awkward, and the server commented about the drinks, and ended up bringing the round we ordered anyway, so now we have an extra round on our table getting warm. At least we won't have to wait for the next round to arrive.   Bottom line:  With all the options in Downtown Summerlin, a restaurant really needs to bring its A game. The soggy food and REALLY bad service makes me regret suggesting it for our monthly get together. We won't be back.",

We ordered the Tuscan chopped salad; kale, tomatoes, soppressata, burrata, crispy prosciutto. Per the menu it was also supposed to have chickpeas but out of the whole salad we were only able to find one (seriuosly, one!). But overall it was good, and a good size portion for sharing. The pizza we ordered was basic margherita, it was ok. The crust is thin which I like, but almost too thin towards the center so when you pick up a slice you have to fold it. I think it could have been cooked a bit longer?   We had an awesome server, Erin. She was really hustling for us. Our group was ordering a lot of drinks, she was on top of it and she checked with us very frequently. So aside from Erin, heres the kinks; the drink service could really use some work. It took a looooong time to get drinks. To give an idea, we sat down and ordered drinks right away. After about 5 min we were ready to order food. Our food came out before we had even gotten our drinks!? This isnt the servers fault, they just need a better system at the bar. New place so it takes time. Overall I like this place and I would recommend checking it out.",

Got the cutting board as our appetizer but how could you mess up cheese, cold cuts and bread right?..Went with the pepperoni pizza as our main which was the biggest mistake of my life (gross, greasy and salty). Literally equivalent to eating Little Caesars that someone drenched with 2 lbs of oil. Was gonna complain but our waitress Courtney, but she recommended good wine so I liked her; plus I ate it all because I was dying of starvation. Conclusion: never order the pizza at Public School. We probably should have gone with the shrimp and grits our waitress recommended as the Summers Cabernet she recommended was good.   Cheers!",

Her name is Vanessa, she wasn't a total food/beer snob, she made great recommendations on the menu, and made sure we had a positive experience.   We started with drinks, my husband is kiiiiind of a beer snob so he enjoyed the selections. I had the \"crushed velvet\" and LOVED IT. Great drink, freshly made, superb balance of alcohol and mixer. I was super impressed.  We chose the buffalo cauliflower for our appetizer, and it was awesome! Flavorful batter on the cauliflower and extra buffalo sauce if you wanted to make them spicier. I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone.  I got the The Huntsman burger for me entree, and it was good. A little undercooked but I'm cool with that. Very hearty, and the carmelized onions help balance the flavor. My husband had the wild mushroom and telaggio pizza. He loved it! Again, great balance of flavor.  We finished off the meal with the Nutella ice cream cookie with bacon brittle. Yum. Don't need to say much else.   It was a really positive experience and I will definitely be back. The only con is that the music is really loud. Or maybe I'm just getting old.",

Also, had the shrimp/grits dish. Everyone was pleased with the food and drinks. The most important part of the meal was the server, Ron. He was not only an excellent server( the best I have seen in a long time) but the way he took a genuine interest in us was amazing. He was so attentive and just made us feel so special. We were all very impressed with this young man.  Ask for him you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "Best service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time! Waiter was Matt and he was very Attentive. I got the Eggs Benedict Pizza, really good prosciutto and the crust was buttery and hot when it came out.  Grandma got the chicken and waffles, tried it as well was really good especially with their take on waffles which was made out of corn bread. Love corn bread and the fact it was eagle texture but still filling and hardy? Perfect. Gravy was chunky but still flavorful. Overall all the flavored balanced well.  Uncle got Lamb Burger, looked good and he enjoyed it but said it needed the creamy horseradish he loves and once he got it A1 as well.  Came for brunch and they also have bottomless options.   5 stars in my eyes because of one key thing. Went to the bathroom and my family had walked out and I thought they'd grab my left over pizza.. Was about half.. They didn't so I walked back to the table - no more than 3 minutes later- pizza had been tossed. Didn't even insist and Matt out of his way to stop what's he's doing speak with his manager and quickly inform me if I am in no rush if I could wait 5-10 for a new one to cook for me to take home. I mean I wasn't and was gonna walk around anyways so I opted to wait around and was expecting maybe half of a smaller version of one. But they gave me an entire pizza.. This one even seemed larger than my original one! Don't know the managers name, Caucasian man maybe 6'3 .. Thank you nd hats off to this place!  Awesome decor; color schemes matched & you can tell the place was good simply by the fact that they were slammed.. I'm not the only one who thinks it too.  100% recommend and I will be back to try some of those crazy percentage drafts",

    "text": "Being a frequent visitor of Downtown Summerlin, (Sephora....need I say more?) when I first noticed this place my boyfriend & I decided we needed to eat there ASAP. We came here on a Friday around 5:45 or so for happy hour. It was packed & we were told happy hour was in the bar area or outside on the patio. We chose the latter. It wasn't too hot & each booth had a fan. I absolutely LOVE the theme of this restaurant. The menus look like the old school composition notebooks. The managers walk around dressed like teachers  I mean, it's adorable.   When we sat down it took a while for our server to come over to us & ask for drinks, but it was super busy so it wasn't a big deal. By the time he came over we already knew what we wanted to order from the happy hour menu (which has really good choices!) so we put in our food order as well.   My boyfriends beer came out first, and about 10 minutes later I finally received my drink. I ordered the crushed velvet which it's their spin on the classic Moscow Mule. It was REALLY good, and I'm not much of a drinker. It had the distinct flavors or blackberry & lavender. Super yummy.   Our food came out pretty quickly. One by one. We ordered the speck & eggs which were really good! The ahi street tacos, also good. The farro & Brussels sprouts salad wasn't all that great, only because it's not my kind of thing. After receiving all our plates our server went to another table. We decided almost immediately that we wanted to order a couple more things before happy hour was over (at 6:30). I looked at my phone & saw it was 6:10 or so. I knew our server would be back before 6:30 so I wasn't worried. Also as a side note, when we got our first plate, my boyfriend ordered another beer.   But here's the thing...our server didn't come back. Not to check on us & see if we liked the food, not to drop off my boyfriends beer. Nothing. Finally another server or runner brought out his beer....20 min later. Yep. 20 MINUTES! What? That's just nuts.   So from 6:10 or so to 6:28 we waited for our server to come back so we could order more from the happy hour menu. Finally he came & we told him we'd like to order one more beer, and another dish from the happy hour menu (PB&J sliders) and something off the happy hour menu (shrimp & grits). To which he responded...\"well happy hour is actually over right now. But I'll try & see if I can get it in.\" I responded with \"but it's only 6:28. I thought happy hour ended at 6:30.\" And he replied with the same thing: \"I'll try to get it in\". I didn't bother telling him that if he had come back to check on us before 18 minutes...we could've put in our order sooner. I knew that if he couldn't \"get it in\" then I was going to speak to a manager.   So he left our table & went to the table directly across from us where a group of women were eating & they too ordered from the happy hour menu. He told them the same thing, that happy hour was over, but he'd \"try\" (like he's doing us all a favor. -__-) and they said what I didn't want to say. \"Well we wanted to order sooner but we couldn't find you. You never came to our table again. If you can't do it, I'd like to speak with a manager.\" He replied with \"I'll try\".   Alas we all got our food at the happy hour prices, and it was bomb. Our server was a SUPER nice guy. He just needs to work on spot checking his tables more often.   I have to say the shrimp & grits were delicious, but the star of the show is the PB&J sliders. We weren't expecting them to be a mind-blowing revelation. But they were. They have a beef patty, crunchy peanut butter, and habanero jelly. They are DIVINE. if you've made it this far into my review, (I applaud you.) and you take away only ONE thing from it, please let it be this: ORDER THE PB&J SLIDERS.   Carry on, fellow Yelpers.",

The chefs have a lot of technical skill - we ordered the salmon, which they placed on top of the brussel sprouts instead of in them, which is great because then the salmon didn't absorb the flavoring of the vegetables, it kept its integrity.  I highly recommend the tots and the chicken and waffle.  Their brunch menu is fantastic and I wish that they offered more of the brunch menu on the regular menu.  The *only* thing I don't love is the regular fries - just nothing really exciting about them, and the last time I had them they were overcooked, hard instead of crispy.",

Classic cafeteria chatter echoing throughout. They didn't do the best job explaining how/where to sit, but our wandering caught the eye of someone who ended up being helpful. It's a \"Make Friends\" atmosphere which grew on us.   The pizza was our least favorite & luckily it was also last. Not quite sure if it's simply because it paled in comparison to everything ahead of it. PB&J sliders are a must! That habanero jam MAKES it! Chorizo Mac n Cheese was good the vinegar crunch was the best touch. The texture of the chorizo set it off a bit... tough & chewy. Not sure if that was just ours or how it is, but good enough to go back and try again!  We also had the Dawn of the Red by Ninkasi Brewing Co - slight hints of pineapple, mango, and papaya. An adventure for your taste buds!  I was on assignment so I had to check out Happy Hour Items only but I was eyeing a watermelon dish that I will update w/ name later.  Overall good time, good taste.

We arrived just before happy hour ended, we had about a 15 min wait for an outside table on a weekday. The food was decent, we tried the margarita pizza, Mac and cheese, PB&J sliders and truffle fries.  The pizza was the best, but with a very soft crust, Mac and cheese was good but the chorizo had an off taste, truffle fries were soso and the sliders were just weird. The service was sub par, with smaller glasses I kinda feel like they should come back to check more often. I had my iced tea empty for over half the meal, the server was also MIA for quite a while, I don't know if he had tables inside toot was just inattentive. Lots of hype and I can't really see why.",

    "text": "Four words - Chipolte Mac & Cheese.  Hands down this is the BEST mac and cheese I've had in my entire life!!  We had the mac & cheese for an appetizer & then for entrees we had chicken and waffles and the Huntsman burger.  The chicken had fantastic flavor and the cornmeal waffle was awesome!  The Huntsman burger was underdone and the char on the outside had nothing to balance it out like strong cheese or sauce so it was a bit off-putting.  I probably wouldn't order it again.   For dessert we had the brownie & the nutella cookie sandwich.  The nutella cookie sandwich was twice the size of my burger and the pecan brittle was amazing!  I really didn't taste the nutella due to the other flavors but I would definitely get this again (and share it with 3 other people).  The brownie was less brownie and more fudge - it was very dense and the top of the brownie seemed to have dark chocolate icing.  Not being a fan of dark chocolate I wasn't a fan but my husband liked it.    Overall, we would definitely come back... and I might just order the mac & cheese as my entree!",

Our waitress karissa was horrible. Sat down and waited ten minutes to get drink orders. She forgot to get my sons order. As she took our drink orders she goes over and talks to another worker for about five minutes then finally goes outside to her other table. I understand when people are busy but she was talking half the time and seemed like she could give two shits. I will give this place another try but maybe for drinks with friends.  Also it's weird they have steak but no a1 or steak sauce? They brought BBQ sauce??! Even fine dining steak houses and chillis have a1 I mean come on. At least a busser , of course not the server she was Mia, had the courtesy to bring out some kind of sauce for my husband.",

    "text": "From the progressive and adventurous beer list to the exciting twists on comfort food, PS702 won me over within minutes of sitting down.    After sitting in a booth in their spacious bar area, we took several minutes to peruse the menu.  Our server, Katie, was incredibly helpful in steering us to choices for beer and appetizers.  She brought us samples of no less than 6 beers from their draft specials--I can't even remember the last time there were 6 beers on tap that I was interested in.  The decor, an eclectic mix of old school school memorabilia--including obsolete encyclopedias, composition notebook menus, and various sports balls--is whimsical and charming, at once evoking nostalgia and chuckles.  We couldn't narrow our choices and ended up with three apps: bacon cheddar tots, fiery calamari, and chorizo mac & cheese.  The tots won immediate approval from DH, with him declaring I must get my own order.  Indeed, they were creamy, salty, bombs of delicious, only made better with the just-the-right-amount-of-heat sriracha ketchup.  Mac & cheese had huge chunks of chorizo and a smattering of kale, just enough so you can pretend it's healthy.  The al dente campanelle smothered in an emmental and cheddar sauce really held the sauce and sausage well, even if it was a tad difficult to serve with the undersized spoon provided.  The calamari, dusted with Japanese togorashi pepper blend and served with a light, but potent, ginger aioli wasn't a revelation, but it was a cut above the standard and would be a good choice for a group. Just be sure to ask for extra of the outstanding aioli.    After overindulging on appetizers, we split the lamb burger.  Melted Brie and tomato cranberry jam made just the right complement of tangy, sour, and umami to the perfectly cooked lamb patty.  The burger belied it's simple appearance, rivaling more complicated offerings from other notable Valley restaurants.  The accompanying kale and shaved Brussels sprout slaw wasn't just a throwaway either.  Creamy, bitter, and pungent with red onion and blue cheese, it still qualified as comfort food while providing a much needed veg on the plate.    Dessert was a ginormous version of the ubiquitously trendy ice cream sandwich, but the additions of Nutella and bacon brittle made it too, a standout.  Service was excellent too, with food served up quickly from the knowledgeable staff.  Katie in particular went above and beyond for us more than once.  I highly recommend requesting her when you visit.  PS702 is open late with a DJ on the spacious patio on Wednesday, Saturday, and industry night on Monday.  They have more typical hours on the other days.  Our next visit will likely be for their weekend brunch, which features a limited menu of delicious sounding breakfast items like fried jidori chicken & green chili cornbread waffles or eggs Benedict pizza.  The high light though is the \"just about bottomless\" drink menu which includes mimosas, micheladas, bloody Mary's (which I'm told are garnished with a chicken wing) and something called a \"beermosa,\" a must try combo of OJ, wheat beer, creme de peche, and lavender.  There is nothing I didn't love about PS702, and I plan to be back soon and often.",

    "text": "I'm very impressed with this place just opening up! Husband and I were seated immediately and our waitress, Christina, came over shortly after. She was wonderful, right away she told us all about the place and pointed out some of her favorite options, which I'm always pleased with when it's not just the most expensive. Also, I liked that they have about 6 dishes that can be made vegetarian by request.   We started with the buffalo cauliflower, her suggestion, which was amazing and I am not a fan on cauliflower. It's served with a blue cheese aioli and Frank's red hot sauce on the side. It was a large portion for the two of us and I would get it again!   Also, we got the ahi tuna wonton tacos. They were good. Not amazing but good. I don't think I would get them again though since the cauliflower left such a big impression.   For dinner I got shrimp and grits with a beer-blanc sauce. It was perfect!!!! I would order this again. The shrimp are cut in half so it looks like you are getting more than what you think you are. I didn't mind this because I like cutting the shrimp in smaller pieces so that I get some in every bite. The lady sitting next to me ordered this and she recommended it but said it was a bit to spicy for her. I enjoyed the bit of heat the dish had and didn't feel that it was all the spicy. I enjoyed just smashing and mixing everything together so that I would get a little of everything in every bite. The portion was large enough for me to take some for lunch tomorrow too which I liked.   Husband got fried jidori chicken & green chili  cornbread waffles that had a bacon red eye gravy on the side. He ate it faster than I've ever seen him eat before! He LOVED it, he said the waffle was a nice savory accompaniment to the fried jidori chicken. I was able to sneak a bite the chicken was the most juiciest and moist chicken that I've had in a long time it was VERY delicious. It was the best tasting chicken I've had in a long time it was creamy yet firm, and had the best chicken flavor I've ever had!   The atmosphere was very hip with all types of decorations from a classroom. The ceiling over the bar looked like a gymnasium floor, they have beer pong, jenga, table shuffle board, and darts. The patio is beautiful, reminds you of a nice back yard with cool seating options. Each cabana like table has their own personal fan for the summer and heater for when it's cooler. They have A variety of seating options anywhere from two toppers to larger parties which I liked because it seems like you wouldn't have to wait as long for tables to get pushed together for parties of 6 or more and they had round tables for larger parties which I like.    This will definitely be our new go to. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu, everything looked scrumptious.",

    "text": "Allow me to give a full explanation into why I would give Public School 702 a 3 star rating rather than the 5 I'd have given if rating on the Culver City location.  My girlfriend came in from out of town as I just relocated from Long Beach to Las Vegas. It was my birthday and lunch was on the agenda. PC offers \"Almost\" Bottomless Mimosas at $10 for a carafe which is approximately 4 glasses per carafe. Instead of orange juice, myself and another friend ordered them with pineapple juice. The waitress took the order and returned with one glass of Mimosa for my friend AND nothing for the rest of us. We then realized she never took anyone else's order. First faux pas.   We finally put in our drink orders; my pineapple \"Almost\" bottomless Mimosa should be in a carafe but is instead served with only a glass (my girlfriend receives hers in a glass as well minus the carafe but with 'garnish'. My glass, nada. The garnish was the rind of the pineapple. Not a slice OF the pineapple....just the rind), a Sprite and a bloody Mary (garnished with fried chicken).   But before the drinks arrive..... We ordered our food.     #1. Lemon Meringue pie #2. Tatters (burned and sent back to the kitchen), buffalo cauliflower, deviled eggs garnished w/ bacon #3. Chorizo mac n' cheese #4. Ahi tuna tacos #5. Burrito (unknown but over cooked. Sent back to the kitchen)  So, our food & drinks arrived within moments of one another. Sounds legit except we had been waiting awhile for our drinks before even putting in our order for food. As stated above, we asked for PINEAPPLE but TWICE orange juice was brought to the table. Food was way over cooked. Our server blamed the kitchen for the burned food and the bar for our delayed drinks. While I realize how challenging food service can be, its part of your responsibility to check orders before bringing them to the table.   At the opposite end of the table, we watched a gentleman return his burger FOUR times. However, they did bragged about the Nutella dessert. Behind them, a food critic seemed to cringe at every entree, app and salad ordered; while on the other side of us we saw another couple complain and send back their drinks.   I did call on the manager because I do enjoy dining at Public School and would love to return with a positive experience. On that, he was very apologetic and ended up compensating our entire meal, drinks included. I'm not saying you should go into every restaurant to find fault only to get your meals comp'd however an establishment such as Public School can only get better with constructive feedback. Had this been my first ever visit, I'd have had a whole other perspective of disappointment, but I have enjoyed their fare prior and it is quite tasty. That Lemon Meringue was off the hizzy! It was our first entree of the day. I also enjoyed the Buffalo cauliflowerl. My chorizo mac n cheese was super interesting topped with sea salted potato chips and the chorizo was actual spicy sausage. I'd for sure recommend it.  Thank you, Nick, for handling the issue as professionally as you did. I will return, as you requested, in about a month with my girlfriend to give it another try. Lets shoot for a FIVE star",

The interior and table settings are all \"school\" themed. Cute idea. Would be ideal place for someone wanting to try a wide variety of beers. Not being a beer drinker myself, I found myself with little options. The cocktails were okay, but nothing I would order again. If you are a big beer fan, definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "It's awesome that Summerlin finally has a good gastropub!  This is a great place to get together and get some good food.  We had the following:  Beers:  They have a seasons selection that changes, if you can't make up your mind you can get little tasters.  I ended up with this golden ale that tasted more like a Guinness but with coffee flavors.  Interesting tasting beer for sure.  Chorizo Mac n Cheese:  AWESOME!  We're fans of salt and vinegar chips so to top off the chorizo Mac n cheese with that just added that extra pop.  It does have some greens, kale, but it's hardly noticeable for those non veggie lovers.  Grilled Watermelon and Heirloom Tomatoes:  Surprisingly this was a great refreshing plate for the summer, definitely a winner in our book.  Chicken and Green Chile Cornbread Waffles:  Heard a lot of great reviews for this, but was a bit disappointed with this one.  The chicken was pretty tender, but the waffle itself was pretty dry and a bit hard to eat without extra gravy and sauce on top of it.  Short Rib:  This dish was delicious!  Tender short rib draped over the mashed potatoes with some grilled onions.  This came out steaming hot, but the flavors were on spot.  Nutella Ice Cream Cookie:  A lot of reviews about this one too, we liked it for the most part but after a few bites it gets too much.  It's a decent size so if you have a group of four it would be perfect to split.  The nice thing about this dessert is the ice cream has bacon bits for those bacon lovers!  Overall the service was great, we had a super friendly waitress.  She was helpful with suggestions and also joked with everyone when she came to the table.  We'll definitely be coming back here!",

Ordered Calamari and Cheddar Cauliflower, and wow one of the best places I've had Calamari. Super crunchy and the sauce it comes with has just enough spice.  The only let down is there's no flavor mix for my margarita! I usually like to drink mango margarita and I the were only able to make regular margarita. It was delish enough, but not enough liquor. Still it was good.   The price however was pretty pricy. Just 1 appetizer and drink was almost $20.  Still I would come back again just to hang out and pre game",

    "text": "This place is generally good. The only things  I will complain about is that is sort of half upscale sports bar and half casual fine dining sort of weird but it works for them. Also because of the half sports bar atmosphere there are tvs which play sport and loud people screaming at the tvs and it gets extremely obnoxious especially since I'm paying $60-$120 to have a meal there. The pricing is IN NO WAY in line with the atmosphere they have crated. Although the theme is cool, I'll give them that.    I think the food is good but overpriced for sure (probably because it's downtown summerlin) but I'd say definitely worth trying out be prepared for a meal for two to be at least $60 that's the minimum. I had the salmon succotash it was good but it was a bit too lemony for my taste and it said \"grilled\" and I though it was more blackened but maybe my definition for grilled is different. I finished my meal. I paired it with a red wine cabernet which went nicely with the salmon.   My boyfriend got a huntsman burger which he enjoyed but he said the ketchup it came with was weird and too spicy for his taste (mine too) I tried his burger it tasted good and was seasoned well (not $20worth though)  All in all its good but no better than like yard house or something and way pricier too.",

As the hostess escorted us to the table all of our closest friends and family jumped up from behind the wall to surprised him! Again, perfect!  It was nice to know that although we had not all arrived, the server (Emily) had taken care of our guests with drinks and appetizers. As the evening progresses, everything came out in a timely matter, drinks were constantly refilled until we had to cut ourselves off, and a manager (forgot her name) even came over to make sure everything was going well.  Thank you to the entire staff who made my boyfriends birthday dinner one to remember! Just, PEEFECT! :)   P.S.

Not a fan of cold hard metal chairs. It was really loud too. Having said that, food was really awesome. Their buffalo cauliflower bites are really good. Beer selection is good too. It's pricy for the very ok ambiance. $9 for kids meal is steep. They were out of Root beer. Wine by the glass is pricy, starts at $9.. they are out of Pinot Grigio.

    "text": "Really cool concept for the whole restaurant. The decor, the white boards, and the menu made you feel like your were back in elementary school. I just wished the service and the food was better!  FOOD Nothing really special here. We tried a number of the appetizers (the bacon cheddar tots, the buffalo cauliflower, and the calamari) along with a couple of drinks, but they were all pretty basic. The appetizers and the drinks were around $10 each. Nothing that I would rave about or come back for. The drinks were good and I did like the fact that they have a variety of beers on tap, but other than that I would not come back solely for the food.  SERVICE This is the main reason why I am only giving them a 2 star rating. Our waiter didn't really seem like he knew what he was doing. He would take our orders and then come back to ask what they were again because he didn't write them down. When he had brought the water bottle to us, he also didn't pour any of it initially and when he saw our glass was empty, we were the ones to ask him to get another bottle of water instead of anticipating our needs. The other waiter delivering food passed us because she too was unsure where the food was to go. I felt like their system was clunky.  LOGISTICS There's never really any issue for parking when we go here. There also wasn't a wait to get in, so that was good. They have USB/regular outlets where you can plug your phone in so that was cool.  This place isn't bad. It looks nice and modern, but the service is poor. The managers need to retrain the staff if anything. I wouldn't recommend others to go here. Try another place with better food and better service!",

    "text": "While poking around Downtown Summerlin in search of a late-ish dinner, my husband and I stumbled upon Public School. The patio looked fun, and I love the kind of look and feel they were going for, so upstairs we went.   We were seated immediately, which wasn't surprising as it was nearly 9pm, and the dining area and patio are both pretty expansive. Our server was friendly and let us know that it was their opening day.   We were tempted by several of the appetizer choices, myself the the buffalo cauliflower, and my husband the bacon tots, but we exercised self control...mostly because a picture of their Nutella cookie popped up on the slide show at the bar, and my husband's eyes glazed over.  He decided on the shrimp and grits, and I went with the farro and brussels salad, subbing roasted chicken for the scallops. It took quite a while to get our food, but we understood it was opening day and there were still service and kitchen bugs to be smoothed out. Nearly 40 minutes after we ordered, our food arrived.   He was very happy with his portion of shrimp, although the they were slightly overlooked. The grits...which were prepared like seared polenta, were tasty, and he liked the greens and grilled corn.   My salad was excellent, the chicken was really flavorful, and that M word I hate, that rhymes with hoist, or joist. I love the texture of farro, and it was excellent combined with shaved brussel sprouts, butternut squash, pecans and dried cranberries. It was extremely filling.   We shared the nutella cookie sandwich, which was two huge chocolate chip cookies, served warm, slathered in Nutella with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in between. By shared, I mean he let me have a couple bites without cracking my knuckles with his spoon.   I deducted a star because even for an opening day, 40ish minutes was a an excessive time to wait for our meal, without any interaction from a server. We both agreed we wanted to try their brunch menu, and saw other things on the dinner menu we wanted to try. As long as they get their service issues ironed out, I see this place as being very successful, and a great addition to Downtown Summerlin.",

I also had a gladnof their Sangiovese which was really nice. Next were the apps, we ordered the Bacon Cheddar Tots & Buffalo  Cauliflower. Both were pretty tasty but I prefered the cauliflower. The Siracha ketchup with the tots is amazing but again I enjoy spicy. **PERFECT BITE ALERT** Cauliflower with the blue cheese aoli and hot sauce on top #yummy. I also tried a bit of friends Watermelon and Tomato Salad AMAZING!   For an entree I ordered the Flat Iron steak with Chorizo Mac n Cheese. The steak was really good and you could cut it with a butter knife. The Mac N Cheese was not good at all but I am a Mac N Cheese snob. It just lacked flavor to me...a dash of salt and pepper would have been great.   Service is really hit or miss. It took some time to get drinks as they had one bartender making drinks for the entire patio. Our server was cool my only issue was he seemed to linger and talk a little much for me. He was so busy telling his life story we had a hard time asking for more water or placing an order. His other tables were a little frustrated as well and he was very over dramatic.   Overall I would give this place another try but it hasn't made my favorites list yet.",

Tried the Earl of Juniper, just a  tad disappointed cuz I couldn't taste any lavender (which maybe was overpowered by the Earl Grey). Bacon Cheddar Tots were so good even though the app is small. The calamari was also good with the aioli & it was more generous in portion. Wild Mushroom & Taleggia pizza was delish. I usually get the Shorty Bowl (sooo fkn good!) but today I'm trying the BBQ Bison Burger & Fish/Chips with the bae.  Oh & there are games like giant Jenga, beer pong & Connect 4! That's always a plus & would make any dinner date less boring.  I'd still come back.",

    "text": "I have mixed reviews about Public School 702. There were some stand out dishes, but there were also dull ones as well.   The Wild Mushroom and Taleggio Pizza is a MUST! I'm sold on anything with truffle oil, and if you feel the same I highly suggest ordering this. I can't wait to go back for this!   The Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower is great as well! Loved the bleu cheese aioli sauce that it's paired with.  Now moving on to the things I wouldn't order again. The Speck and Eggs weren't that great. A little too salty if you ask me. Also, the Ahi Tuna Poke tasted off. I didn't think it paired well with the passion fruit. If you like fruity tuna poke, then maybe this is the dish for you, but it wasn't for me.   Would I go back to Public School 702? Yes! I would go back just for the pizza and cauliflower. It was THAT good! Other than that, Public School 702 was mediocre. If you're confused by my review, I told you at the very top that I had \"mixed reviews.\"",

On our last visit we ordered a hot tea and they brought hot water but they were out of the tea I wanted and they charged me 2.50 , uh really hot water is 2.50.

I love their Ahi Tuna and their flat bread.   Definitely a great spot for friends to hang out and enjoy good food and beer, they also have a nice patio overlooking the fountain, on the weekend sometimes there's a cool band playing which make it even cooler.

    "text": "Disappointing. We waited for 702 to open for a very long time after trying the public school in California first and absolutely falling inlove with it. Let me start this review by saying we really tried to love this place. We have gone at least 10 times ( all for the love of craft beer).  PROS: Atmosphere is very cool. And of course the #1 reason anyone should go there is for the rotating tap. The managers have tried to make our experiences a little better by sending out a few comped meals, very much appreciated but tasteless.  CONS: Food is nothing special. We have had everything on the happy hour menu +. The only thing worth eating our the chicken sausage, which they have been out of the last 3 times I tried to give this place another attempt. You get a very small portion of chicken sausage for too high of a price for happy hour. And they are only available on happy hour boo (thumbs down) Everything else on the menu is really really uneventful.  Bartenders are not very knowledgeable about the beer which is just plain saddening.   Let me share our brunch experience. The mimosas are a joke. If u want good bottomless mimosas I suggest Echo and Rig and DW Bistro. The mimosas at 702 come premixed for u, which is ridiculous I'm an adult and will choose how much champagne I would like in my mimosa thank you. When asked if we could have our OJ on the side the answer was no. When we went to order our waitress told us those particular items would not be ready to order for a 45 mins.. um excuse me? So we waited and 45 mins to put in on order and another 40 to get our food, which of course was tasteless. Brunch was a complete joke and the waitress wasn't anything special either.   If we return it will be for beer only. That's all they got going for them. So sad.",

Several servers and staff including the hostess that sat us walked by without saying a word. So when our server, Carissa did come over we told her we had been waiting for 15 minutes and she gave us attitude and just said \"ok, there was confusion with the tables\". And she wasn't very nice about it either. We placed our order and it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. Our food came fairly quick and I'm sad to say it was not worth the wait. I had the seared scallop salad and it was very bland. I would have asked for more dressing but Carissa was no where to be found. The entire time we were there she checked on us once, she was not pleasant at all or even smiled. Such a shame because the atmosphere of the restaurant is fun, cute decor, and quite a fun bar menu, but I don't feel we will be back due to the horrible service we received. With so many restaurants in downtown summerlin I would rather go someplace where they at least act like they want our business and are not rude to us.",

We sat ourselves in the bar which is open seating and was great since we didn't have to wait. Our server was a comical and energetic gentlemen named Jared. Great personality for a server. The craft beer menu is daunting but he got us some samples of recommendations and we all found something we liked. We ordered food family style so we could all try everything. We ordered the tots, Mac and cheese, pepperoni pizza and the Tuscan salad. Everything was awesome, it came out staggered so we're able to try it all hot and fresh. We would have tried the cookie sandwich but were stuffed. Well come back and try it next time as well definitely be back. If you're going see if Jared's working. He said there were two of them though so ask for Jared Smithe.",

It was just taco meat over Fritos with a little cheese cream sauce.  Very dry and uninspired.   Sliders were tiny dry burger rounds on oversized buns.   Chorizo Mac and Cheese was excellent.",

The layout of the restaurant is great, with imagery bringing you back to school days and a clear view through the kitchen where you can see the chefs create tasty dishes. The beer choices are on point and the staff is knowledgeable and will help with any questions you have (from seasonal favorites to what will pair well with certain dishes). The food is what really drove me write this review. Speck and Eggs were phenomenal, Roasted Chicken and Quinoa Salad exceptional, Schoolyard Dog outstanding... but the best thing there has to be the Irish Stout Short Ribs, mouthwatering and extremely flavorful!! Make sure you save some room for dessert, the Chef's special dessert (chocolate chip cookie with nutella, vanilla ice cream and fried prosciutto/bacon with nilla wafers) brought the whole meal together. Left completely full, happy and satisfied. Will definitely be coming back!",

(It seemed busy, but I asked out server, Tahni, and she actually said it was slow that day. Must mean they can handle crowds well). We sat at the bar and got to watch some the games on their TVs.   As the name suggests, the decor and the menu look like a classy public school. (Composition book menus, notepad lined paper looking napkins, and shelves of books and gloves, etc). I'm a high school teacher and I think it's such a Great theme!   The food menu (composition book) is not large; amounting to about one side, however there is much to choose from. I don't remember the entrees because we mostly had appetizers and pizzas, but what came out to tables around us looked delicious as well! (We ordered the ahi tuna poke, bacon cheddar tots, pizza, buffalo cauliflower & Brussels sprouts. All were delicious, however, you could probably do without the ahi poke. Wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it to be).  They have beer on rotations as well as the beer on the left side of their menu. Go for those on rotations and ask your server if you'd like to try something before getting it! If you're not a fan of beers, they do have wine and a full bar! Try it out!   5 stars for good food & drinks , good service, and an awesome theme.",

Our friends had pb&j burger, ruben sandwich and fish and chips and they all said their meals were wonderful. I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  It had some kind of a sriracha sauce which gave it a great tanginess.  There was some kind of a slaw with kale which gave it a crunchiness.  It was on a brioche bun which was fabulous. I did have a problem because I asked that the waitress make sure my fries were hot but they were not so she replaced them. My husband was not as lucky.  He asked for a burger medium rare and it came out with no pink.  He chose not to get another one but let the waitress know.  When it came time to pay the bill they said they had not only taken off his item but mine also which I thought was very nice and totally unnecessary.  This is good customer service and we will definitely be back there.",

Both were very...different, but a good different.  We ordered food to share & it was just the right amount.  Let's start with the crispy buffalo cauliflower..this was very crunchy and tasty. Their buffalo sauce and bleu cheese dressing was perfect, not too overpowering like other places. We also ordered the deviled eggs. These came out with great presentation, the crispy piece of prosciutto and chili threads were a nice touch. The flavor was eggs-celent!  Lastly, we had the eggs Benedict pizza. Thin crust with prosciutto and sunny side up eggs. It was slightly salty, but we figured it was because of the prosciutto and ate it anyway. It's still a very innovative and delicious brunch dish.  We will be back to try other small bites! Oh and our server, Amberly, was awesome!",

I was surprised how large both the interior and the outdoor patio were.  There was plenty of room outside on this nice afternoon and we got a table in the shade.  The theming around a school is a gimmick but it's OK.  That's how you make your brand stand out when the food is similar to what you can get any number of places.  I got the fried chicken sandwich with fries and an iced tea.  Service was quick and friendly.  The sandwich was good and the atmosphere was very enjoyable.

We tried the $13 calamari, which is mediocre at best and the portion size was barely a handful of calamari. When the runner placed it on the table, first thought that came to mind, \"that's it? Where'd the rest of the $9 I paid for?\".  Next was the Truffle Fries. Yet again a bit of a let down on portion size. $7 for the bottom of a brown paper bag the cashier at a gas station would put your can of beer in.   For the Buffalo Cauliflower, they were actually good and decent for the price, I guess. 6 pieces (and some crumbles) for $8.  We both decided on the BBQ Chicken Salad (minus the BBQ sauce). $16 for the salad.. subpar yet agian.  The worst thing of all was the service. We asked for drink refills and the server suddenly disappeared.. we waited and waited and waited.. finally asked the manager for our refills.  Overall, this place is a \"been there, done that\" type of place for us..",

Even our pizza was pretty good but nothing any different that I've tried before.   The only thing that was disappointing was the customer service. This is why I'm giving a 1 star. I would of gave this place a higher review but we had told the hostess in the front it's our mothers birthday and we wanted to do lil something for her. She said they can do a cake and candle and she will let our server know.  So here we are waiting and waiting for the cake. The server comes grabs our check and here we are anticipating for the cake to surprise my mom. So 15 min later I'm like damn does it really take that long to give back my card. So I'm thinking maybe they're going to give the cake when she returns with our card. But noooo our server comes back and gives us back our card and tells us have a nice day. So we left.  So upset!! We really wanted to surprise my mom. Never again coming back here.   Not trained employees who don't give a crap.",

The server was named Ron and we really got lucky to get him as our server. He had a great personality and we had some laughs with him.  I prob should have taken his advice to have the shrimp and grits which he said was his fave item on the menu.  Food:  Roasted chicken & Quinoa Salad- this was just ok.  A little bland and slightly dry.   It's an Omelet: tasty but the omelet itself was on the small side.  Tasty potatoes and sough dough bread accompanied it. $13   Pepperoni Pizza: $13 good portion. Served hot and tasty  They have a large outdoor seating deck outside and tables through out are nicely spread out so no one is on top of each other. The ceilings are nice and high (which I like) and even with a bunch of people eating in there...you never feel cramped and it's not so noisy that you have to talk over other diners.",

Funny enough, I was most impressed by their sauces. They make house made blue cheese and ranch, and this ginger aoli which paired well with the calamari. Overall, such a great place to meet up with friends, eat good food, and get a couple of drinks!",

Awesome recommendations, I'm always curious about a PB&J Burger for some reason so if i see one I will 99% of the time order it and I have to say it was the best one I've had yet!! The blackberry habanero jelly made the burger. Thank you for not slathering a plain boring grape jelly on it, it's done and tired and this was a nice surprise for flavor. My husband ordered the Colorado Lamb Burger and it also was really good and not dry (not everyone can cook lamb right so this to was awesome!)

They have absolutely no designated smoking area even though the patio is immense. Being a professional in the hospitality industry, you never say no to a guest. It would be a reasonable accommodation to make a small corner a smoking area. You can't tell every smoker to completely exit the premises in order to have a smoke. Other than that, great atmosphere!",

To our surprise, everything was perfect, from when we first entered to when we left. When you walk in, the atmosphere is super hipster (which I enjoy). The decor made me feel like I wanted to go to the library to study, lol. Never thought I'd ever say that. They have indoor and outdoor seating. There is also a bar area that looks super nice. We sat at a booth and there are outlets for you to charge stuff with (pretty fancy if I say so myself). Our server came up to us quickly and got our drink orders right away. Babe got a lemonade and I had a water with lemon (per usual). She even gave me a water pitcher which is pretty cool seeing that a lot of places don't offer that. We ordered calamari for the appetizer, the fried chicken sandwich, and grilled chicken and quinoa salad. Everything was super delicious. They were all tasty and full of flavor. Babe said he's never had calamari that good and I really enjoyed the sandwich sauce and the salad dressing.   We truly felt like it was a 5 star experience and we couldn't thank them enough for filling up our bellies with delicious food! If we're ever in the area I'm sure we'll be back! I definitely wanna try sitting outside next time when it's cooler.   Ps, they have happy hour but it's only offered at the bar.",

Ordered the Hot Mess and the Bison Burger both with fries.  Server made sure to ask if medium was okay on the Bison and I agreed.  It came well, but was still okay.  The place is big and they were not on a wait.  Our server was nice, but very busy apparently.  It started to get weird waiting for my next beer order to be taken and waiting maybe 15-20 mins with just my water.  Then we sat longer with empty plates and waited way long for a check that was promised twice during the wait.  Not sure the food outweighed the experience.",

They have indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating can be very lively. The outdoor seating provides a wonderful vista of the shopping plaza and is a perfect getaway for a date night for a dinner with a group of friends. They do have some outdoor games like chess, checkers, and oversize Jenga. Overall a wonderful place to eat in the staff is always professional and provides top quality service...

A very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after school/education like atmosphere. Everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. This huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. This casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. Not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. They also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. Menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. It is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. Choices of even Lamb and Bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 is family and kid friendly & very refreshing. As casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. Prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. Definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in Downtown Summerlin.",

It was more like peanut butter consistency, rather than creamy. The happy hour specials are decent. Decent portions, decent prices. Definitely get the cauliflower bites, those are delicious.",

We had the bacon cheddar tator tots for an app and they were good too. Best fish fry is Las Vegas that we have found - and that is coming from Wisconsinites! Go Public School 702!

Service was okay at best (Grade C) , yes they were polite and positive (Grade B). The kitchen slowed them down and what they served was nothing I would be proud to turn in (Grade D). Overall I'd give Public School a  grade of (C). To stand out in  Downtown Summerlin Pubic School needs to take some extra credit and study a little harder.",

The decor had a blast from the past vibe fused with a school vibe. The pair of metal strap on roller skates really brought back some memories. Came in on a Saturday at eleven a.m. and the place had about twenty people.  An hour later and the place was packed. On to the food. Started with the spicy calamari. The calamari was cooked perfectly. However, because of the bay seasoning, the amount of salt was overpowering. Ordered the Huntsman burger with extra bacon. Loved the flavor of the balsamic caramelized onions. The downside is that my burger sat in the burger juice and the bottom bun got soggy. The fries were over cooked, but I enjoyed the crunch. Ended lunch with a Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. Very sweet and is a huge portion. I could only eat half, but enjoyed this dessert. Ambience and service was on point. Food was not so great. I will give this place a second try to make sure that it wasn't just what I ordered. I really like the selection of beers and that they served Tenaya Creek beer. One of the best beers in Vegas. I imagine that this would be a great place to have a reunion or to just party.",

We ordered drinks and an appetizer (deviled eggs, they were very good). We had finished our drinks and appetizer and were sitting there holding our menus wanting to order food. She walked past us several times without stopping to ask if we wanted to order. We finally flagged her down and she said \"oh, I thought you already ordered, I guess that was a different table\".  We ordered the Huntsman burger and the Bison burger, both were pretty good. When our food came out we asked for a side of dressing, which we never got. Our food was delivered by a runner and our server never checked back in to see of everything was ok.  Also, don't order soda, it's a rip off. My husband ordered a Diet Coke, it came in a glass 8oz bottle that they charge $2.75 for.  The need to work on their service if they want to stay open.

My boyfriend and I walked in to no one standing at the hostess stand except for a miserable waitress who just rolled her eyes when my boyfriend said hello to her. We proceeded to the bar only to be disappointed once again by a bartender who didn't have time to properly greet or acknowledge us. Long story short we decided this place was not worth our time or money and left. It's too bad because it seemed like this place had potential.",

    "text": "This was our 3rd time eating here and our last.  1rst time was a decent experience, 2nd time awful experience and 3rd time a repeat of the 2nd.    The last 2 times have been very consistent though.  Slow and indifferent wait staff, undercooked food, and frigid  ambient air.  Make sure to bring a Parka as management likes to keep the temp to the point that you can see your breath.  In addition, if you are so lucky to be placed at the tables with the uncomfortable aluminum chairs, you get that extra chill literally to the seat of your pants.    Service has been very slow last 2 visits, even when they aren't busy and my impression is that this restaurant already has outgrew it's \"new coolness\", but for some reason continued to feel that they are special and thus not open to suggestions, My impression is upper management likely feel customers will continue to return no matter the experience and this feels to me very reminiscent of the restaurants of the 80s who felt big and bad, refused to change, and thus are nothing but a memory on the internet search pages under \"top ten 80's chain restaurants that failed in the 80s\" Nothing has changed between our 2nd and 3rd visits (spaced about 4 months apart) and that usually means nothing will.    I unfortunately will not recommend The Public House to anyone who lives in or is visiting Vegas, as there are many better options with staff that care about you and do not act like they are the \"in thing\", and that you are lucky to be sitting there, as well as food that taste better with a better price.  The menu tries to be original in choices but comes off being bland and flavorless.    I always give a place 3 chances and this one unfortunately will not get a 4th.  I estimate this place will not last beyond another 1-2 years.",

Everything you might expect from a place in the center of the the newest place in town, Downtown Summerlin.  Food: C.C.B Burger and fries  The burger was amazing with every ingredient showcased in ever bite. My only issue with the burger, it is crazy wet. Quite the pool that left my hands sticky from the balsamic and my bun nearly disintegrated for the final bites. The fries are pretty standard in design and implementation but the way they compliment the burger is fantastic. Whatever they did to make them work so well is a mystery since they appeared to be very normal fries.  Drinks: Coffee milk stout from Stone brewing  Excellent lightweight stout with a dark complexion and a dark chocolate finish that is pleasant with every sip or gulp. If you like Murphy's or Guinness this stout should put you right where you want to be.",

One was a (hard/stale) chocolate chip cookie sandwhich with bacon bits wrapped all around the ice cream. I also ordered the fudge brownie which was very dense and dry. The ice cream it was topped with had cayenne pepper sprinkled all on top!! I accidentally took a small amount to see if it was cinnamon or nutmeg possibly (considering they put bacon on ice cream), but nope, it was cayenne pepper. I wish I would've been warned by the waiter or if it would be written on the menu. It killed the taste of the whole thing. The layout was nice but it's extremely loud inside.",

As for the service- this guy was on point! Kept glasses full, stopped in to check on us and made us feel right at home, he knew the ins and outs of the menu, and great suggestions.

HH food is still on the pricey side in my opinion. HH Ahi Tuna Fish Tacos $7, 4 smaller than average street tacos; taste decent. HH chicken wings $6 very good, worth it!   HH Chorizo Mac&Cheese $7 (normal $10). TERRIBLE! WORST MAC&Cheese ever. Cheese is runny and bland, like they thinned in milk. Was served in cast iron dish, but some how the cheese is still runny, did you forget to bake it?! Chorizo is Spanish style and cured; I was expecting Mexican style, but menu doesn't clarify. Salt and Vinegar lays potato chips on top added for crunch, but was not fully crumbled and made the dish difficult to eat. Kale is added, so I can pretend that the dish healthy, but does nothing to taste.   Our server Mark was great, truly understanding, and helpful.  My recommendation for this place go for the beer and atmosphere only! Food is so-so, but pricey.",

We had a drink (prices not bad for happy hour) and the flat bread with hummus and baba ganoush. Both were awesome. The overall menu is very gastropub-style and I'll be back at some point to try some of their food. Would also check out the outdoor seating, on a deck that is shaded in the afternoon.

We decided to try this establishment with my two year old. (Fingers crossed)   It was perfect! Even the kid's meal presentation was on point. I had the steak salad and my hubby had the fish and chips. Very good. Ambiance was not too loud but just enough to drown out her fun that she was having.   We are looking forward to going back this week for a little date night. The menu had a great amount of options and the decor was well thought out. Food was very fresh.   Hoping that this restaurant opens up another location soon!!! Please go check it out. Well worth the money.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time for happy hour with my wife, brother and sister-in-law. The venues in a really cool location in the Summerlin marketplace. Right above Fogo day ciao  The vibe is really cool, the music playing is alternative with a mix of top 40 and some old-school 90s tunes. The name and the Decour totally match;you walk in and you feel like you're in a science lab or library with chalkboards and comfortable seating. In the bar It's communal seating very long tables with 10-12 stools on either side.  I would coin this as a bar, not a sports bar there was only one TV in the bar that I could see so if you want to watch the basketball games, you'll have to go someplace else. We sat in the bar for only about five minutes, before we even ordered drinks because they were going to allow us to have happy hour on the outdoor patio, which is delightful, great atmosphere, not as noisy as inside, the weather was warm and helpful service.  The first look; the menus were notebooks you would see in college, they had a small clipboard as well as a happy hour menu. The happy hour menu had 8 to 10 food options along with some wine and beer.  They also had well drink specials to.  I tried just about everything on the appetizer menu, and was disappointed the ahi poke was bland, the PB&J sliders wasn't explained to me that that was actually a hamburger slider with peanut butter and jelly, just didn't go together for our tables liking. My wife loves pizza, so she ordered the margarita pizza, which didn't have enough cheese on it. The pizza sauce was a little spicy which both my wife and I like. I'm a huge hummus fan and was excited to try a white bean hummus to know what that really was, it was OK it needed a little salt to increase the flavor, just to me tasted flat.   There was no salt-and-pepper on the tables, I try to get a hold my waiter \"Brandon\" it wasn't his fault. I wanted to tell Brandon that the appetizers were mediocre at best and return the pb&j sliders but it was \"good Friday\" and I didn't want to be too picky and \"thankful\" but I had 6 appetizers and not one stood out. Oh that's  not True, I did try the fried cauliflower which was probably the most appetizing appetizer.  The service was very good they leave a water bottle at your table so I don't have to keep asking the waiter every time to fill my water glass cup, I really like that.  I wouldn't go back there for any of their food, if their happy hour appetizers are so boring I wouldn't expect the food to be any better. I would go back for a drink or have a glass of wine with my wife (no food), the brewery across the street at the redrock Casino has far better appetizers and 10 times the amount of choices.   Right before our party of four left I had to make a quick stop in the bathroom, I came out and did see one of the chalkboards talking about their specials I know there was a few errors I'm probably being too picky here but they said their beers for $4-7, I didn't see any beers on the menu that were $4, management should update their signage to properly address that the happy hour menu says.",

I really hope this was just an off night at Public School 702, because I really love the ambiance and live music on weekend nights.   I was feeling like pasta with a meaty red sauce, so I ordered the bolognese. But it had a very strange flavor and atypical meat sauce. I think the only reason I ate it without complaint was due to the utter mortifying food experience and all around bad day my friend was having.  The chef made things right though by making me an off the menu light salad. The poached pears with mixed greens and prosciutto salad topped with candied pecans and goat cheese was really really good!! I would come back just to have this salad.  For dessert, I had the lemon meringue with a graham cracker bottom. The dessert looked absolutely scrumptious. The meringue was super good, but the lemon custard was way too sweet for my palate. I had to cut the sweetness between sips of my dark roast and otherwise bitter coffee.  The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. Because my two experiences were very different from one another, I am sure I will come for another visit in the near future.",

Don't expect to find a light beer of any kind and defiantly no Corona.  Order the buffalo cauliflower it's a signature item and nice sized.

I totally crave to go back! also tried a coconut beer, little bitter for my taste but not bad.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this restaurant.  The restaurant is beautiful, location great, and I had heard their food was pretty good, but I was sadly mistaken.  Our disappointing visit started as soon as we walked in the door... one of the hostesses was talking with a waiter in the corner, looked our way a few times, made eye contact, but did not stop her conversation.  We then thought that maybe she wasn't a hostess and started walking into the dinning area... we saw some people, but didn't know if there were hosts.  We returned to the front and stood for a few minutes.  The hostess from the corner and two other people we had walked by in the dinning room all came over at once?  Okay, finally seated!  Our waitress never refilled our drinks and our food was so salty and overall not good.  It was just a bad experience and I do not recommend eating here.  There are so many better options in Downtown Summerlin!",

The bar area had these lab tables that put you shoulder to shoulder with others which was awesome for socializing. The dining room has a really neat solar system light up above. The food was delicious and the service was really good. We went for fathers day and they were giving all the men a free choice of their draft beer for fathers day. Pretty cool. I'll definitely go back",

    "text": "My friend, who is a Vegas and Summerlin local suggested that we check out Public School because it has a cool vibe to it and it was in the new plaza that was built.   We came in around 9PM on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy. The hostess told us that we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we grabbed a table and menus were brought to us almost immediately. Our server then came out with a bottle of water and two cups for us.   I loved the ambiance here because it was super cute and hipster-like. I felt like this would be a place I could find somewhere in Portland. The decor mirrors that of a classroom, so you have yearbooks, dictionaries, encyclopedias, math cards, and all that jazz around the restaurant. The menus itself look like composition notebooks and the theme is followed through to every aspect of the venue.   We got the Citra Rye Pale Ale. Now, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but this had a lychee and grapefruit scent that followed the bitterness of the beer, which was nice. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it wasn't even expensive! $5 for a glass of this goodness. Perhaps this will be my step towards developing a taste for beer.   We then ordered a brown bag of fries. The fries were perfectly cooked and came with Siracha Ketchup and mustard BBQ sauce. The ketchup overpowered the Siracha so you can smell the Siracha, but the taste of it is very faint. The mustard BBQ sauce almost tastes like honey bbq. Quite interesting.  We also got The Cutting Board, which was an assortment of artisan cheeses and cured meats. We had a goat cheese, blue cheese, and sheep cheese with prosciutto and salami. There was also cashews, jam, onions, and other little things on the board with toasted artisan bread thinly sliced in the middle. All very interesting and tasty. It's chef's choice, so this probably changes from day-to-day.   I loved the atmosphere of this place and how cool everything is. I'll definitely want to visit again next time I come into town.",

    "text": "It's been a while since we've been here and honestly I cant remember every detail on how our visit went. But what I can remember is what this review will be based on.   We came during lunch on a weekday. Probably the best time to come because we were seated right away. Had a nice seat with a view by the window. The place is decorated nice! Its modern but with a school theme.  Hence the name.   I quickly started to notice the small things. Like the USB Plugs at every table.. The Composition Looking Menu.. The Edison Light Bulbs.. ALSO the dirty cloth napkin that was sitting in front of me. White cotton napkin. I was wearing black and being the gentleman that I am I placed the white napkin on my lap. That was a mistake. I didnt have my lint roller with me.  Our waitress brought us our water. 2 dirty glasses and a dirty glass bottle filled with chilled tap water.  Were they even washed??  2 strikes.. Waiting for the 3rd?? I ordered a drink (diet coke). On the menu it never stated that they were tiny bottles and they were $2.50! I told the waitress.. I wish it said that on the menu or was disclosed that when I ordered..most big restaurants/pubs have soda on tap. Well this was really disappointing.   On to the food.  For starters we tried the Bacon Cheesy Tots. It was a recommendation from our waitress.  Deep fried golden brown to perfection. Crispy outside and high in flavor! Sriracha Ketchup on the side! Yum!!  BBQ Bison Burger with Quinoa Salad - Wow! They can really make a damn good burger!!  Patty was grilled to perfection (medium-well) for me. The BBQ sauce was good and not too sweet. The Quinoa was cooked perfect as well.   Now this is what I dont remember.. My wife ordered a HotDog of some sort. I checked the online menu and I didn't see it. Maybe it was a special or something.  Bun was toasted yet soft center. The hot dog itself was overcooked. Like something you see inside 7-11 when they've been sitting on the rollers for hours upon hours. But, the toppings on it made up for it.   It was an ok visit for our lunch date.  I'll try it again. Maybe a dinner date with my beautiful wife.",

However I, on the other hand, did not.  I called in an order of pizza. The order taker was very kind and triple checked all my info. When I arrived there were a bunch of people blocking the doorway, waiting for tables, and unwilling to let me through. Once I make it past, and to the bar/pickup, I can see my food sitting on the cold counter. I was rather upset.  The bartender was very nice, greeted me in under a minute, attended to my order immediately, and with a smile. Did my best to be nice back, but couldn't shake the agitation of my food sitting out. I Falsely assumed it would remain under a heat lamp until pick-up. My guess is it sat for 5-10m, as it was luke-warm once I got to my car.   Overall, I'll give this place one more try, maybe... But only as dining-in, and only when it's slow.   I'd advise people to never do take-out.",

    "text": "First time visit last night & we were absolutely impressed! We joined another couple for Happy Hour at 4:00pm & were seated at a very large booth in the bar area the moment we arrived which was great because it was pretty busy & continued to fill up to capacity.  Lauren was our server & was at our table the minute the hostess left, she asked if we wanted to order drinks/water which was appreciated since the other half of our party was running late & we were ready for some refreshments. Cold water arrived immediately, drinks followed within minutes which was a surprise since, again, it was pretty busy! As soon as the rest of our party arrived Lauren was back to take their order, within a minute or two. She took care to answer the boys questions about the large variety of beers & made some helpful suggestions, she mentioned that she was a bartender as well, so she was really informed on the bar offerings. She returned less than 10 minutes later with the additional drinks then answered questions about the menu, again offered a few suggestions. We selected the Farro Salad & Dip Duo, both arrived within five minutes, both had great flavors and nice presentation! Lauren did not hover, but did check in to see how we were doing, we sent her away with more drink and food orders...round two! We ordered 2 orders of Crispy Ahi Tacos, Crispy Cauliflower, Wild Mushroom Pizza and another order of Farro Salad (it was THAT good!). Again, everything came out very quickly & was perfect, each item was a very good size and did well to fill us up! We even ended up with a free order of Speck & Eggs due to the fact that one of the other servers mixed up her tables & had an extra, they were tasty as well! Lauren checked in on us a few more times & made sure that we had everything we needed, all in all we were there over three hours and she never made us feel that we were holding up a table, she was a perfect server & we will ask to sit in her section the next time we come.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and the cool design/decor and will definitely go back, can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy the patio!!!",

They offer an impressive tap list without overwhelming you with just \"more\". The Roasted Beet Salad is worth the trip in and of itself with the Crispy Cauliflower and Shrimp-n-Grits a close second. We've really enjoyed everything we've tried. My only knock is the way the combined space echoes and amplifies sound. The dining section is very noisy when they're half-full and it's bordering on mind-numbing when full. Absolutely to be expected (enjoyed!) in the pub section but the carry-over into the dining area is overbearing. You'll thoroughly enjoy your meal / beverage but don't expect to have a memorable conversation over dinner.",

To give you guys the shortest possible version, the server brought my 23 month old son spicy SRIRACHA ketchup with his kids fries, and we didn't realize until he started CHOKING in the booth with tears in his eyes, frantically asking for his water. No apology, just a \"oh my god, my bad!! I'll bring regular ketchup.\" I was so shaken up I could barely speak, and our server couldn't care less. My poor baby. Then, my mom found a short grey hair in her salad, to which our server told my mom she was wrong, and that it was ginger. I'm pretty sure ginger doesn't have a cuticle, and I am a hairstylist, I know what hair looks like. I look at it daily. We both lost our appetites, the server never checked to see how my son was, never apologized for either thing, and a manager never even came over to say one word. We still paid a $35 bill and still left a 20% tip because I don't believe in not tipping, but we will never be back, and I urge everyone else to do the same.",

And the steak with mushroom salad, our mid rare steak was cooked properly but the arugula didn't do the plate justice ( also the portion of greens was off for the price.)",

    "text": "Im giving this institution one star because unfortunately I cant give anything below.  This is my first time at this place.  I came with two friends of mine all of us first timers and Vegas veterans and who are well versed with quality and service of food in this town for many years.  We came here for a Saturday brunch , sat at the bar and we experienced intermittent to zero service.  The staff seemed like they didnt care at all.  We ordered the breakfast burritto without cheese and we were told since it was \"premade\" they couldnt customize it at all.  When the food came out it tasted like it was overbaked, dry, sauceless and tasteless and on top of it it was heavy and seemed deep fried.  Furthermore, we ordered bottomless drinks and we got a mimosa on average once every 25 minutes on average.  This is truly unacceptable from a Las Vegas standard I would expect more from an institution especially since its among several fine restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  I hope the management reviews this carefully and takes it constructively because they really should step up their game - until then I would unlikely come here again or recommend it to family and friends.  The management did take our entrees off the bill which was most appreciated.",

Tonight's dinner took 3 hours for 2 people to have apps, entree and share a dessert!!! Why does it always take so long for a serve to acknowledge a table once seated? And it usually just spirals from there. This night it was a missing appetizer that I had remind the server about. It finally showed up at the end of the meal. If it wasn't for the awesome pizza and BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER I would never come back. Sometimes a meal is worth sitting thru bad service for.",

    "text": "Labor Day. Expected it to be crowded, and it was. The great thing about Public School 702 is its size. Even while busy, like today, you can't tell it is because the tables are spread out nicely to not give the appearance that it's  bustling.  I've been here a handful of times since its opening and have never been utterly disappointed with the food. It's just good bar food but does not blazea trail of culinary excellence or originality. Service always seems to start off a little slow but due to team service model, once the order is in, food and drink get out at a good clip.  That being said, this is a review for weekend  brunch service. The brunch menu is more interesting that the regular menu, and we enjoyed it much more. Flavors were bold and serving sizes were huge.  We had the jidori chicken and green chili cornbread waffles and the chicken sausage with cheese grits. The chicken and waffles was one of the better interpretations of this classic dish. The waffle was more savory, and the slight heat from the green chili offset some of the heaviness of the dish. The chicken sausage and grits were good and plentiful stuffed with wilted kale, cherry tomatoes, and topped with an over easy egg. The menu didn't indicate that it would be spicy but there was definitely some heat in the vegetable mixture, which I appreciated.  Paired with the grits, it was a very filling meal. I would've appreciated a biscuit or some piece of bread to sop up some sauce, but then again, I may have had to wear a biscuit since I was so full.  For those with kids, this is a good place to eat some grown up food and appease some kids' boring palates. They have a kids menu with the standards - mac and cheese, pizza, chicken, cheese burger sliders, etc. Portions are large (a couple of young kids could share a pizza) but it's not the cheapest kids' meals either. Noise level isn't too much of a concern because there's always a game of shuffle board where the banging of the pucks sound like large wood planks slamming against each other.   It's a good choice for the whole family and especially if you're walking around DT Summerlin. Cool inside dining and if eating outdoors is your thing, they have a nice patio, but most of the view is parking lot and a little of the water feature at the north end of the mall.",

We sat on the patio area of the restaurant and it was beautiful. The conversation was good, so we didn't realize that our food hadn't come out for an hour. Our waitress was very attentive and was actually the one that brought it up to attention. They came back up to us to apologize and bought another round of drinks for us.

Chorizo pieces were too hard for my liking but the hubs said that's how it's supposed to be, that real chorizo.  Loved how it was topped with salt and vinegar potato chips. That way yummy. I kept going back for more! I had the short ribs which was very tender just not enough flavor for me. I needed salt. Nutella cookie was good but I prefer soft gooey cookies, this one was a little hard. My husband said you could ask them to warm it up.   Next visit I do want to try the shrimp pasta, bison burger and lemon dessert :)  I did also find it strange that reservations over 6 need manager approval. I never got a callback to confirm. Luckily plans changed and it was just a party of four so I was able to reserve on line.  Service was good once we got there. Waitress was nice and helpful and apologetic when dessert took some time. Overall cool new spot, just have to find some favorite dishes.",

    "text": "We were quite excited to eat here, the menu looked right up our alley and it's a Gastropub.  The dining area is very loud, if you want to be able to hear each other sit outside.  The outside area is very nice, great view. There's misters and fans.  The music needs help, but I just blocked it out with good convo.  The service here is good, we didn't get utensils but they came after we asked. The guy seemed new to serving, which is fine, we got the right order and drinks were filled.   The food was pretty good, not slammin, but delicious. We had the tater tots and chorizo mac and cheese to start.  The tater tots were very greasy, hardly any crunch and lacked the bacon flavor they were supposed to have. They missed the mark on that one, but the idea was good, if they could execute it they would be great. The tots just fell apart and were mushy.  The Mac and cheese had a sausage chorizo, and had big kettle chips on top.  It was cheesy but I love that crunchy bread crumb topping on mac and cheese, and it didn't have it, the chips just fell off and were useless. I wished they also used ground chorizo, that stuff is excellent when mixed with gooey cheese.   For the main courses we had the Shrimp and cheddar grits, this was really good.  Great sauce, it was light, and the grit patty had a nice crunch to it.  They did that right, awesome.  We also had the short ribs.  They were a bit fatty, but the meat was very tender and great flavor. It reminded me of a meal you'd have at home on a holiday.  The mashed potatoes were sitting in a nice gravy, and they give you plenty of meat.  They also put some crispy brussell sprout chips on top.  They were really good.  Nice and salty with a slight char.  All in all it was pretty good, they have some kinks to work out, but it's a great place to eat outside and have drinks and food. If they play some good music it'll be a hip hang out. I'd go back for sure.",

When we arrived we were told a 1hr wait but it actually turned out ti be about less than 15mins. We ordered fried calamari, specks and eggs, banger and mash, skillet steak w/ chorizo mac n cheese, lemon meringue (beware VERY TART!!!!), and crushed velvet drinks(the only thing i DIDNT like, its pretty but way to much ginger).

So big the food, while good, ends up cold if you aren't next to the kitchen. So big, it takes a server five minutes to get to one side and back.  ...However, there are some big flavors here that I wouldn't shy away from. The tots are delicious, and the sriracha ketchup add the right kick to compliment the cheese and bacon filling. The chorizo mac n' cheese had some great textures and a full bite with everything in it showed what this dish could do (if piping hot). The Jidori Chicken & Waffles was a hit. I hope they use the cornbread muffin as some sort of breakfast dish, because I'd eat it morning, noon, and night.  I recommend trying Public School. It has a lot to look at, a great beer selection, and a short, yet formidable cocktail list.",

    "text": "Very cool spot, great for dinner or late night drinks/snacks. We got there shortly after 9pm on Saturday night and it was busy! We sat in a booth near the bar and there were outlets and USB outlets on the wall (every restaurant should have this!).  Ordered the crispy buffalo cauliflower, which is possibly the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and the bacon cheddar tots. In an attempt to be healthy, I got a tomato and watermelon stacked salad. It was just okay. My hubby got the steak, which came with chorizo mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was fantastic! Not too cheesy, not too greasy, and still very flavorful.   I often feel like a 70 year trapped in a nearly 40 year old body, so it was a little noisy for my taste, but if we were there at 6:30 on a Wednesday night instead, I'm sure it would've been a slightly different experience. But overall great food and I'd definitely go back!",

HOWEVER... service----- SLOW SLOW SLOWWWWWW!!! Hence, the 3 star review. What's the deal!!??!! The waiter was nice but very forgetful. Drinks seemed to take a very long time. The drinks were in my opinion overpriced.. this isn't the strip, it's freakin Summerlin.. why do we have to price gouge the locals? My Jack Daniels and water was somewhere around $20. Come on!   My grilled salmon was absolutely delicious. It was $21 but it was worth it. My friends enjoyed the deviled egg appetizers and tater tots. Again, food was very good but service, they need to improve. Couldn't tell if it was the waiter, the kitchen, the bar or all of the above that made everything seem so slow. Not sure that I will come back anytime soon.",

He checked up on us the perfect amount of times and we have come back time and time again to sit at the bar, eat, and drink because of the good service he provides. His name is Connor, look him up. We've mainly seen him here in the afternoons.   Now the food, I would give the food 4 stars because it's different every time. We love the kale Caesar salad with chicken or salmon both are amazing and it goes amazing mixed with the roasted chicken and quinoa salad. I personally don't like the roasted chicken and quinoa salad without the kale Caesar salad.  The Buffalo crispy cauliflower is beyond believable. That's why it's 4 stars and not 3 for the food. I swear this cauliflower could make me go vegetarian if all I ate was chicken lol but I love steak, pork and lamb so no deal lol but seriously what would says it's definitely better than boneless chicken wings for sure!  The drink we had was amazing. It's like a lavander Moscow mule. I got mine Virgin but it comes alcoholic too. Super aromatic and delicious.",

    "text": "I really hate it when I find a new restaurant that becomes an instant favorite, we go often, and then one day  corporate decides to change the menu,  take away their top-selling items, which were our favorite things to order, make entree sizes way smaller but keep the prices the same. We have been to public school 702 many many times it's always been good until last night.  The menu was noticeably smaller missing many items such as the shrimp and grits which was my personal favorite.  So I didn't get to order that. I've had the chicken and waffles before which is also really good but when I saw it pass by me on its way to another table I noticed how it was about half the size portion that it normally is but still the same price on the menu.  My husband ordered a lamb burger asked for it to be medium rare it was cooked well done. Lamb is not good cooked well done. The calamari was cold as if it had been sitting up in the window for a while even though we got it shortly after we ordered it thinking maybe it was an order for somebody else. My girls love the chicken and fries and normally the chicken tenders are a much larger portion these are two very small pieces of chicken that we're all most over cooked. Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful and gave us some insight as to why there were changes made was profusely apologetic about the lamb burger being over cooked,  comped us the burger, which she didn't need to do, and even gave us a free appetizer coupon.  Service was excellent like it always is we didn't blame her for anything it's just unfortunate that corporate has decided to make these changes to what was once a good restaurant.  Not sure if we're going to come back.",

    "text": "Heard about this from a fellow Yelper and last minute changed my plans to go here instead of Cheesecake Factory! I'm glad I made the change and so was my friend.  We came in and the placed was very spacious, well lighted with natural light from the glass windows. The globes on the ceiling was very nostalgic. So were the chalk boards and even down to that weird smelling brown paper towels they used in elementary school (I know they also use it at other places but still).  Another surprise was when we were sat down and saw the menu. The throwback to the notebook, the scanttron test menu for brunch and the napkins! Once we were down with the nostalgia overload (and I so wanted to grab a pencil #2 and fill in the test ), my friend and I went through the menu.   Everything was decently priced and we so wanted to order everything but we had to control ourselves. Our waitress, Kaila, suggested we do the Beermosa... wow. I didn't think beer and champagne would be great together but I was proven wrong. That and $10 for a bottomless, why not?  We ordered the mezze plate, mac and cheese and ahi tuna nicoise.  Mezze plate looked like it could feed 3-4 people but between me and my friend we did our best. The highlight was the nice firm and not too salty marinated feta, tapenade and hummus. The Flatbread was nicely grilled and perfect. Downside was the babaghanoush needed more citrus and salt/seasoning. The fried chickpeas was ok. But for next time I will try and see if they can accommodate a double babaghanoush and hummus only :-3  Ahi tuna nicoise was great.  Big portion. Would serve 1 person for a full lunch meal but great split between two people. We were given the wrong salad initially ( we were served the scallop and Brussels sprouts salad... was so tempted to say yes that it was our salad and that she forgot  our ahi but we are definitely coming back to try that salad ). The dressing was great. Perfect citrus notes and  not too over powering. The take on the eggs being served \"deviled\" style was a nice surprise. Bibb lettuce had not lost its very little crunch to it (meaning the salad was perfectly dressed). The one thing we did not care for was the potatoes.  It seemed like an after thought to their composition as it had no salt/seasoning. Trying to mix it with the salad dressing didn't save it so we just picked around it.  The fact that we had to stop ourselves with this order should tell you the portions are great. We got the bacon mac and cheese.. and man seeing those salt and vinegar chips on top.. I was in love with the dish. Not too cheesey and not too dry. One of the best mac and cheeses (sorry for me you guys haven't beat out Beecher's Mac and Cheese).  These little nuances is not the cause of the 4 star rating.  The rating mostly goes to the amount  of Beermosa refills we had. You guys have definitely beat out DW Bistro for my go to brunch place from now on, but the lag on the drink refills was the one that did you in. My tip to myself for future visits and to others with a small group... sit at the bar and see if they can fill up your drinks on the fly without the wait.  Other than that I will definitely be back along with some friends in the near future!  Definitely have to come back and try the Recess!",

Describing the outside seating area as humungous is an understatement. It just keeps going and going...  Since public school 702 is on the second level u get a very nice view of downtown summerlin. It's also located at the prettiest spot next to the big water sculpture and cactus gardens.  The view is cool but the jumbo sized games are the best reason to sit outside. They have a huge version of connect 4 and Jenga along with beer pong.  On my last visit we tried the pbj burger sliders which were fairly good. The meat was a little drier than we liked but the bacon was good and peanut butter and jelly on a burger is better than it sounds. Our waitress was fantastic.",

A tiny bit of crumble was on top. And the blackberry seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth. Other guest had the brownie. It was more like thick chocolate cake, but was ruined by the chili powder on top. We didn't finish our dessert.   The decor was cool. School themed, even the menus.

We have never had a great waiter and always felt the larger parties ordering lots of drinks were receiving priority. I waited 15 minutes for my wine as I watched sit on the bar getting warm. My husband ordered a beer that was brought right away and he was finished before my drink came. They changed the menu and did not let us know. We ordered the cheese plate and when it came it was half the size it used to be for the same price. A lot of what we were looking forward to was gone and they refused to take it back. Our food was mediocre at best and took way too long to get to us. There are plenty of other places in downtown Summerlin to go so I will make sure I give them my business instead since our objections fell on deaf ears.",

Sad they got rid of the Dawn of the Red beer.  It wasn't very good, I may try it again someday but odds are I won't.  Service was slow but the servers were nice...

    "text": "Came for happy hour and wound up sitting outside, by myself for a while.  First off, why do they not have misters outside? Everyone who came out later due to the bar area being full was complaining about the heat and the misters would have helped.  I didn't see any heaters either but maybe they plan to set up portable ones in the winter?    While it took a bit to get a waiter out to me I was kind of expecting it since I was the only one there.  He brought me a bottle of water and recommended a few beers to taste which I took him up on (being able to taste the beers before you commit to a pint is really great).  He came back fairly quickly again to let me know that he put in the tastes and to take my food order.  The food came at a good pace (tacos first then broccolini) but I waited, and waited for the beer tastes and my cocktail.  He did come out to let me know the bar was backed up and I finally got my beer to taste and picked one (still didn't have the cocktail).  My beer and cocktail finally came out after newer people's drinks so my server said he was taking the drinks off the bill which I appreciated.  However, I let him know I was ready for my bill and then waited, and waited, and waited again until another server who had come out to serve the filling outside area got me my bill.  So the missing two stars are for the slow service.  The food was good and I will be back again to give it another go.  But a tip for others: Friday happy hour is very popular so get there early!",

My plate looked pretty empty, Denny's gives you more food. My eggs were cold and the bacon was mostly fat. Since my boyfriends food (EGGS BENEDICT PIZZA $13) was free he also ordered a beer. Our bill plus tip was $30. So that's $30 for what looks like a child's plate and 1 beer. My opinion is that there are so many better options and we would have gotten better food for a better price. The chairs, Oh my god, the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in!! I should also note, while we were waiting a lot of the other food being served looked really good. This is just my opinion on 1 plate and the price.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times both for brunch and lunch and as much as I absolutely love the decor and ambience (which is all \"School Subject Themed\") the food has always been underwhelming and the service, somewhat subpar.   Most of the waiter's seem quite friendly and fairly attentive and some are incredibly well-versed on the beer menu and will go so-far as to suggest food pairings, which I think is pretty fun.   In this last visit, I received my check, paid with my Card and it was processed for over TWICE what I owed. Now, to be fair, this was an accident and the waiter was absolutely shocked at \"how\" this happened, since it appeared to be an anomaly, however, he took what (hopefully) would become the Voided Ticket, so I have to way to prove my card was charged twice (or mis-charged) on my end, if need be.   This round, I ordered the chicken burger and my brother had the lamb. Honestly, I prefer his over mine and I appreciate that quinoa is a substitute option over fries (which come with a spicy ketchup that is good, but not my taste-bud preference.) I definitely preferred his burger to mine, although I liked that my Chicken was, in fact, a ground chicken patty and not just a strip of chicken breast.   We did arrive during a Knight's Game, so it's possible that food service was a bit backed up, although only the front of the restaurant/bar was filled - there were still plenty of opens seats that lacked TV views. My brother and I opted to sit outside and it was a beautiful day, with clear skies and the misters provided an occasional dusting of coolness which was perfect and relaxing.   All-in-all, I just wish I liked the food a little more and I wish the brunch menu was more exciting, somehow. I want to LOVE Public School, but there's something about this place that just keeps falling short of my expectations.",

We ordered several items and were please with each. We hope that corporate will allow for the menu to be changed to be more accommodating to variety of tastes and allow the chefs to perform as they should!  Please add STEVIA to the sweeteners!  Jane was the manager this visit and was a significant improvement over prior managers. She should be the GM and handle customer interactions.This location is in a great spot in Downtown Summerlin and has some impressive indoor and outdoor seating to include USB outlets at some of the tables for charging devices.  The restrooms were very spacious and clean, and the staff were super friendly and energetic. This location really needed a management change and I am glad to see it happening.",

It's clearly been perfected,  and the flat bead you get with it is perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside,  like a light wood fired pizza crust.    The service could use a little fine tuning.  Whenever I go,  I always feel like I'm walking into a place that I wasn't invited to,  where everyone  (aka the staff) all know each other and don't really want to add a new person to their friend group.  When the bartenders aren't distracted by the other staff members in personal conversations,  they have always been attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "Came here last Friday night and just barely missed 'Recess'.   Overall, not the worst. But for the price, there's a lot of other restaurants that I'd rather visit on a Friday night in downtown Summerlin.   Appetizer:  We ordered the bacon cheddar tots which were extremely oily, but had a nice creamy inside and the sriracha ketchup added a nice sweet and spicy flavor to it.  Main dishes:   Chicken burger - forget the name bc it was extremely forgettable. Bland but the chicken was juicy. The side we got was the quinoa which didn't have feta as advertised and was so dry.  Bangers and Mash - chicken sausages were just okay, the mashed potatoes with bacon and shredded sauteed Brussels sprouts were good, but not good enough to save the entire dish.   BBQ Bison burger - asked for medium rare but it was basically well done. Not extremely flavorful or seasoned. Would pass on this next time.   The waitress delivered our dishes and dropped a hefty handful of fries on the floor as she was placing a plate on the table. She apologized and we didn't mind, but she said she'd come back with more fries to make up for it...which she never did. And we couldn't find her after that incident so we couldn't ask to follow up.   Beer flight:  The IPA was actually not half bad, and the earthy hop was average. It's nice to have the option of a $5 sampler.   Overall: Nice atmosphere to gather with friends and get appetizers during the happy hour. Main entrees and ordering appetizers post recess/hh not worth it.",

Server came by to check on things after we were almost done with appetizers. Got our entrees. Asparagus and goat cheese fritatta which was over cooked, dry and had hardly any cheese. The fish and chips were just ok. Fries were soggy. Tried to get some plain regular ketchup and it took so long I had to go inside and ask the bartender who literally ran back to kitchen. I got back with ketchup same time runner did. Again, our actual server showed up to check on things way too late to be of any service. What happened to this place?",

I love the ambiance and the vibe, and I've only had one slow experience with the server but other then that one time it has always been amazing!  I have sat in the regular seating area, in the bar, and outside....on a nice day, defiantly choose to sit outside. You can see most of DTS from the outside area which is a fun vibe.

The eggs benedict pizza is a good brunch choice, but the chicken sandwich (the brunch one) is friggin good, their normal burger is *elevated*, and I love their bangers and mash. I always try a drink, but I normally don't like alcoholic drinks that much, so I'm not a good guide there. I like that it's seasonal!   The servers are so nice. One did Nevada trivia on our first time there with my boyfriend. Before that though, I went with a tinder date - and he ordered me a second glass of wine, but I was super uncomfortable, so I poured most of it down a drain on the patio when he went to the bathroom. The waitress saw, I explained to her that he was a creep, and then when he didn't pay for the wine that HE had ordered ME, the waitress took the second glass off my bill and drew a smiley face on it. So yeah. Good place.",

It was overly salty, and on top of that, it had a lot of horseradish on top of the hash. They pretty much smeared it on top, and I had to scrape off most of the rest of the food that touched it. So disappointing! I did mention it to the server, but instead of offering to take it back, she defended it by saying that the horseradish was the main ingredient of the dish. Could you just believe that BS! The manager came and left a coupon to use for when we come back. Obviously we left it on the table, and never again will I be back at this place.",

    "text": "This place was very cool. I love the school theme, down to the Menu having a cover of a composition notebook, the napkins looking like lined paper, and the drinks on a clipboard. The bar area resembled cafeteria style seating too. The lighting was soft but brighter than most which made for great pics (at least at the bar seating). It was definitely packed. Their menu wasn't very extensive, but had unique items. Prices were reasonable. You could order appetizers for under $10. Speaking of appetizers, we ordered chicken wings, edamame hummus, buffalo cauliflower, bacon and cheddar tater tots.   The cauliflower was SO GOOD!! I didn't know what to expect honestly. I thought it would be steamed cauliflower. But these were breaded and fried. Considering it is a veggie that can get very soft, they were actually very crunchy and flavorful! You couldn't tell there was cauliflower in there. And they gave you enough to share. It was my favorite thing there.   The chicken wings were ok, I didn't have any but my family did. My family also LOVED the Bacon & Cheddar tots. I expected them to be smothered, but they weren't. They were literally tater tots with bacon and cheese inside. So good! I personally also loved the Edamame Hummus. My family liked it but not as much as the tots and cauliflower. But the hummus was my 2nd fave. The flatbread was grilled what seemed like on an open fire, because pieces of it were charred- which to me added to the flavor. I love charred pieces! I was very surprised at the hummus and bread, I would order it again for sure!   My brother had their pizza, which we were not impressed with. I wouldn't order that but I'm glad I tried a slice. Something about their crust.....  But guys....I tried their PB&J Burger.....split it in quarters. Crunchy peanut butter with a blackberry habanero jam (house made). On a real piece of meat! I was scared! I love me some burgers so I was very skeptical....and sharing it helped ease my fears LOL! BUT it was actually very good!!! I feel like the jam could be spicier (wish it were) but maybe it would be too spicy for some and also, you can never tell how hot a pepper is until you taste it. Also, the jam was very runny- almost like a syrup. But overall I would order it again and NOT SHARE.   Service was ok. The pizza came after we all finished eating- they must've forgotten? They served us our appetizers but didn't give us any plates or silverware- we had to ask for those. That's why I deducted 1 star.   Overall, I would recommend this place and plan to go back!",

This is a great place to visit for and just enjoy the company of friends and alcohol with great food. We were drinking beer and getting ready to go out for the nights festivities.   The service here was stellar and since we sat at the bar there was no wait time for our party, but two of our party we're already here so that our drinks were at the table when we walked in. Wow, what are friends for! The tele's play the Knights game and that is the only sport currently that I am following, so it was good and we were winning too!

I can tell she is nice so that comes through, and I appreciate her thinking WITH us as we tried to get a guava juice for our kid.  She checked the price and made a good decision to proceed when it was reasonable (many servers would return with the information for us to make decision- extending the effort and time to delivery.) She took charge and got it done quickly.    Thank you, we enjoyed our evening.  It was my first visit, though I've intended to often.  The bartender was knowledgable about the beer and I found a new favorite one Dopplebock-previously unknown to me!  Just a great experience I hope to have over and over again.   Thank you Mr. O'Daniel, for this night I hold you responsible- great team!",

Our table of four finished it within a couple minutes.  Unfortunately, the turning point occurred shortly thereafter when I cut into the burger and raw egg white spilled out. I will say that the chicken patty was flavorful, but there's really no coming back from that kind of a mistake. Another major issue was that the quinoa salad I got as a side...with no dressing it was pretty much a waste.  The restaurant definitely takes the school theme extremely far, and I guess they should get props for that, but I personally found it to be more weird than charming. 2.5 Stars.",

Plenty of seating in the bar area and the restaurant has plenty of tables as well. The bar area extends outside to some comfortable booths and tables. It was such a beautiful evening we elected to sit outside. The patio overlooks part of Downtown Summerlin and the darker it became, the prettier the view became.  Upon being seated, we were greeted quickly by our server. We decided to take advantage of the HH deals. We ordered the cauliflower buffalo wings, cheeseburger sliders, margarita pizza and the Italian meatballs. My friends both ordered the Tangerine Dream beer, I had a Pacific Ale from Ballast Brewery our of San Diego. Our server was super attentive and helpful. Our food arrived quickly and hot. All of us devoured the cauliflower buffalo wings. I had never had these before but really liked them. The meatballs and sliders were also tasty. I passed on the pizza but I was informed it was delicious.   All in all we really enjoyed our time at this restaurant. Service was remarkable and very customer friendly. I anticipate returning to enjoy a full lunch or dinner in the future.",

From the flash cards around the bar, the books on the shelves, the chalkboards, to the napkins that look like lined paper, they did a great job making you feel like your back in school. They truly ace their service and menu! We sat at the bar with Sidney and she was a delight! She was fast, gave us great recommendations, and was attentive to our making sure our glasses were never empty. I tried their most popular \"Crushed Velvet\" cocktail and I could have easily had 3-4 of these. It's a great spin on the Moscow mule but with a blackberry and blueberry puree that's spectacular. I ordered their fried Chicken & green Chile cornbread waffles, which was melt-in-your-effing-mouth! The chicken was so juicy and the twist of cornbread for the waffles made these the best I've ever had. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! We will be back again!! And again!",

I wasn't asked my preference for the steak, but I would say it was medium to well cooked.  If you are averse to noise as I am, I would recommend going when it is less hot outside. They have misters going, but it was still pretty hot. The fans were unfortunately out of order, but we were told they will be fixed soon. Perhaps I will update if we return.

Happy Hour specials are available in the bar area and outside on the patio Mon-Fri from 3:30PM - 6:30PM. We ended up out on the patio with a nice view of Downtown Summerlin. I'm thanking my lucky stars we stumbled in here just in time for \"Recess\".    CRISPY CAULIFLOWER ($4 HH): The favorite of the evening. According to the menu, it's supposed to be served with blue cheese dressing AND buffalo sauce but we only got the blue cheese. The cauliflower is amazing! I'd highly recommend getting an order of these. 5/5   PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES ($4 HH): A large portion of flavorful fries, but neither of us cared for the lemon aioli. They tasted better straight up! 4/5  MARGHERITA PIZZA ($6 HH): Lightly dusted with red pepper flakes and a pinch of basil leaves. Would have liked for there to be more basil and less charred black dustiness on the crust. 3/5  CRISPY NAKED WINGS ($6 HH): Came with 7 or 8 good-sized wings and my guy thought they tasted great. We learned Public School 702 does not serve ranch and that their sauces are made from scratch. 4/5  CHORIZO MAC & CHEESE ($7 HH): Sans the chorizo so we could both share. The vinegar potato chips layered on top added an unexpected crunch, as did the surprise arugula. The mac & cheese was slightly spicy because of red pepper flakes in the dish - wise choice. 4/5     FOUNTAIN DRINKS ($2.75 HH): My husband ordered a coke and it came in one of those cutsie bottles. Unfortunately, refills are not free. The extra coke was $1.50. What are we, in Europe? I just had water, and our server left a nice vase of water at the table so I could get all the refills I wanted. 2/5  VIBE: Public School 702 has a class act theme, complete with menus that look like old school notebooks, chalkboards displaying the specials, and an awesome galaxy set up that would win any science fair competition in the main dining area. This new gastro pub feels industrial and trendy, and I love it here! 5/5   SERVICE: Selina was an awesome server! She checked up on us often and was super nice. 4/5  Worth a Return Visit? There's still so many Happy Hour menu items I'm dying to try. And, I will definitely get the legendary Nutella Cookie dessert Yelpers are talking about next time I visit! Two thumbs up Public School 702.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #187",

We asked for a table and all the happy hour seatings were taken so we had to sit outside in the hot humidity. The table we originally sat at had a broken fan and all the other booths that had fans were taken... Luckily we had to move since we had more people join us that originally planned.  The food was alright. It wasn't the best I've had and their beer selection was okay. I wouldn't recommend this place for a happy hour event.",

    "text": "Decided to drop in here for lunch one day because its new and many of my friends have tried it out. Rolled in around 2:30 pm and it wasn't too busy. No hostess at the front table so I just wandered over to the bar area. Sat down and looked over their bar which is loaded with plenty of beers and some interesting alcohol selections as well.  Christina the bartender came over and greeted me with a smile and explained that a few selections were out, and more about their featured beer menu which changes weekly. I chose a nice Citrus-y IPA and looked over the menu for some food.  This is where they lose some stars because I read the menu several times looking for something that would pique my interest but there really wasn't anything that screamed \"Eat me\". I ended up going with the CCB, or chicken burger. It was decent, with bacon and avocado and cooked well. But it wasn't fantastic out of this world good.   The two girls next to me were sharing a pizza, and I could see that it was slightly burnt. Didn't look all that impressive. At least the girls were pretty to look at. TV's above the bar seemed out of place and not really a focal point of the bar area. Maybe this place is hopping during Happy Hours. It is a huge space with plenty of tables, and an outdoor patio area that overlooks a nice garden and water feature.   Total bill was $22 for a beer and a chicken burger, so I probably won't venture back in for a meal but might do some drinking here.",

    "text": "We tried Public School 702 shortly after they opened for business.  We started with a couple of appetizers. I didn't love the calamari, but I typically don't enjoy fried calamari so that wasn't too surprising. The tater tots were the highlight of the appetizers.   For an entree I ordered the cobb burger and chose the kale and brussel sprout slaw. When my food came they had given me fries instead, but quickly noticed their error and brought me the slaw. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors were great. Lots of bleu cheese and drippy egg and the slaw was on point as well. I enjoyed my meal quite a bit.   The service was very attentive. Some were a bit overzealous since the restaurant just opened but I appreciated the extra effort.   I'd be interested in coming back to try more of their menu and possibly happy hour some Time soon.",

There was 6 of us and we sat in an area of the restaurant that wasn't too crowded and had enough elbow room at the table to be comfortable. The service was good, and she was able to accommodate 6 different orders. I had the sausage and grits, which was very interesting because the grits were in a loaf somewhat, and not the country time grits style that I'm used to. It had corn, bacon, sausage, kale, tomatoes, eggs and that loaf that came together nicely.   I changed the egg from fried to scrambled because no matter how hard I try fried egg just doesn't work for my taste buds. Their \"almost bottomless\" is a good deal, you can choose 4 drinks individually, or 4 of the same drinks for $10. The bloody mary came with a chicken wing, which I actually wasn't ready for and slightly confused, but it gave it a nice kick. Overall, this was a great place to meet up with friends, have a couple drinks, and eat good food.",

Came here on a Wednesday night with some girls, and a DJ was playing some awesome 90's hip hop, alternating with some karaoke action.   Bacon and cheddar tater tots- 4/5. Everyone loved it but I thought it was good.  Summer succotash- 4/5. Good stuff but not to die for. First time eating succotash and apparently it doesn't get any better than this.  Deviled eggs-3/5. Good but nothing special.  Truffle fries- 4/5 Good but I've had better.  Mezza plate- 3/5.  The waiter recommended this. I didn't think the hummus and anything else was that great except for the fried garbanzo bean that was crunchy on the outside.  Shrimp and grits- 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor, shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the grits patty that looks like a hash brown was absolutely delicious. I'd come back for this dish hands down.   Phenomenal selection of beers available here. One extra star for carrying my fave beer...Greenflash IPA.  Service was excellent. It's slow because it was busy, but our waiter Jared was super helpful, friendly, and made sure we were taken care of though keep in mind service is generally slow and our food took a while to arrive.   Kyle, the GM came by to say hello and he was super nice as well.  I like the ambiance of this place, and the DJ who played awesome music really made the night for me. Met a lot of cool locals. I'd definitely come back to try the jidori fried chicken as well as their burgers. Kudos to Jared for putting up with us ladies on our girls night out! ;)",

It's not always the fastest, but the servers are friendly and happy to oblige.  Food - I love the buffalo cauliflower, burgers, and the shrimp and grits is to DIE for! It had a 'cake' of grits with an amazing blend of shrimp and kale sauteed with sauce to top it.   Drink - I've been pregnant both times I've been here, but the husband says that he loves the beers! I have had their homemade lemonade which is delicious.  Atmosphere - I love the themes in the restaurant related to school and 'homework' for takeout food.

The kids pizza was HUGE, enough for two people. My husband enjoyed the breakfast that came with eggs, two big potatoes and bacon. He said it was the best bacon and potatoes he's tasted and he doesn't like potatoes.  Service: Friendly and attentive.  Ambiance: Very cool decor, wood floors and metal chairs.

This restaurant was very cute and charming, with a schoolhouse theme throughout. It appeared that they were training new employees when we visited for lunch, as both the hostess and the servers were shadowing other employees. Everyone was cheerful and pleasant, and aside from the newbies asking a few questions of the more experienced, it didn't detract from the service at all.  We settled on an appetizer of the cheese and bacon tator tots. They were yummy! Deep fried tator tots, with bacon and cheese inside, served with sirracha ketchup- how can you go wrong?   For my main course, I got the CCB, which was their version of a Cobb sandwich. It was a chicken patty, served with lettuce, avocado, bacon, and onion, with their own special sauce. It was yummy! I loved the bread too, although it didn't hold up too well by the end. Their fries were good, not great (thin fries), but again, that sirracha ketchup helped add a little kick.  My friend enjoyed his burger as well, but I didn't get to taste it. They have a vast selection of beers, if you are into the brews, and what looked like a really fun outdoor area.  Another Downtown Summerlin restaurant checked off the list! I wouldn't mind getting detention here, though!",

For a week, I've been imagining what it could possibly taste like and feel like until I've finally decided to try it.  By the entrance is a glass display with sports trophies, Pom poms, Michael Jordan lunchbox, algebra book, calculus book and all things that would remind you of school minus the nun that smacks your hand with a ruler because this is Public School 702. You just get budget cuts.  The menu would remind you of a notebook and the napkins would remind you of a notepad. Blackboards on the wall and the moon and planets above your head. Hipsters with their glasses, beards, sleeve tats and a beer. 90's hip hop playing in the background.  We tried the grilled salmon, bison burger, chicken and waffles and the Nutella Cookie Sandwich. The entrees were just ok. The bison burger had a nice spicy kick to it but I also almost had an anaphylactic reaction because of an ingredient that wasn't on the menu description but was somehow in burger. The fries were not great.  The Nutella Cookie Sandwich would be the only reason I'd come back here. So, you get chocolate chip cookies with Nutella schmeared on the flat side of the cookies, vanilla ice cream in the middle with a wall of bacon brittle. \"I got 5 on it\"...yup, it's only $5 that's big enough for 2-3 people.  The service could use remedial lessons.",

Simple acknowledgement goes a very long way!  The menus were like black notebooks which immediately caught my eye and the beer list was typed on notebook paper. Very original.  Started with a vanilla, blueberry canned beer called the big blue van and surprisingly it was really good! They specialize in a lot of crafted beers so if you like beer I recommend this spot. Next we had the tuna nicoise salad and then the short ribs. The food was prompt and very good.   Service was 5 stars. Even though we had one server many others touched out table to make sure we were ok or to check if we needed anything. I will be back for sure!  Side note: cool spot for group gatherings that have a oudoor patio area with its own bar AND.... A beer pong table!!! Lol",

    "text": "Loved this place!  After hearing very good things about Public School 702 from others, my wife and I went to this new addition to Downtown Summerlin for the first time last night, and brought friends along from out of town.  It was definitely worth the time it took to drive downtown to get them, then drive back to Summerlin for this dining experience.  With it's school themed decor, the atmosphere is unique enough that the interior doesn't look like just another gastrobup and bar.  The vide was happy across the entire restaurant, with everyone looking like they'd waited all week to finally be there.  I'm not sure why, but it was noticeable and different than many other comparable places.  The waitstaff kept active all the time.  I never saw anyone stop, and although we had a dedicated waiter, several others would quickly swing by the table to take empty plates away, bring more water, etc.  Onto the food:  delicious!  I had the Grilled Salmon with Summer Succotash, my wife and one of our friends had The Huntsman burger, and our other had the Shrimp and Grafton Cheddar Grits.  The food was hot and perfectly prepared.  Everything looked fantastic when they brought it out.  The succotash with my salmon was the best I've had anywhere.  Tell you what:  this was definitely not \"public school\" cafeteria food.  I'll definitely go back and try many of the other dishes on the menu.  Beer:  lots of craft beer choices with a standing list in the menu, plus another sheet at the table of beers they're temporarily featuring.  Of note, they had at least one \"sour\" beer on the menu.  I'd only recently heard of this kind of beer and was pleased to see sour options available in a place that features craft beer as a part of the dining experience.  You really need to take a look at the menu to see all your standing beer choices.  Definitely make a reservation when you go.  We had a seat near the window and could see a line forming at the door periodically as people waited for a tables to open.  You can make a reservation right from the restaurant's website or through Yelp (worked great!).  To the restaurant's credit, the hostesses seemed to work through the line very quickly every time it built up, although I couldn't tell if folks were queuing up waiting for any table, or for a table they reserved.  We sat inside, but noticed there's ample outdoor patio seating overlooking the more scenic part of Downtown Summerlin.  The option to sit outside is always a plus!  Take note, it's loud inside.  Not ridiculously loud, but the larger size of the dining area tied to a lack of decor that would help muffle or absorb sound fosters a fairly loud environment.  Even so, it wasn't a detractor.  Even though this is definitely not a public school's cafeteria, the volume may remind you of those days when you and your friends we're carrying on conversations in the buzzing school cafeteria.  Again, not a problem; just know it going in.  This isn't the place for a quiet, intimate date.  One small misstep I chalk up to a restaurant still finding their stride: no salt and pepper on the table, but it was quickly remedied when we pointed it out.  We'll definitely go again.  And again.  If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars right now, and assuming Public School 702 hits its stride they way I think it will, don't be surprised to see me update my review to a five stars after another visit or two.",

I must say, the concept is neat.  It definitely resembles a public school.  The menu was quite extensive but after reading some trustworthy reviews on yelp, we went for the naked wings and the Jidori spiced chicken and waffles.  The portion was humongous.  Earl also ordered a citrus beer and I took a small sip.  I think all beer is yucky but this one was interesting...it started out sour, then got kind of buttery creamy taste.  I liked it very much though I can't drink to much since I am still nursing.  The ambiance was very nice since we sat out in the patio on this beautiful day.",

I love downtown summerlin and its contemporary dining offerings so I keep getting drawn to this place. The atmosphere is fine, it's like an interpretive, modern take on a schoolhouse and I guess that's the point.   The food is a little above 3 stars. The flavors of the green chili chicken and cornbread waffles threw me off at first, but I definitely left wanting more. Bacon cheddar tots are total comfort food. Tried to be healthy one time so I ordered the kale Caesar with salmon--salmon was cooked well, but the dressing was bland.   All the makings to be a cool Friday night neighborhood bar/restaurant, but I just can't get passed the service. Every time we come here, we've had to wait for water, drink orders, food, you name it. Just this last Friday night, they brought our appetizer out super quick, but turned out to be for another table so they took it back!!! And then ours was another 20-30 minutes. Yep.",

The fried chicken was moist and delicious gravy on the side; the cornmeal waffles were the highlight of the dish. The pizza was out of this world delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with egg and hollandaise sauce on it. The salmon was so moist and perfectly done. The succotash with citrus sauce was an unexpected delight. Even the standard ahi tuna salad was really good. I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying everything!",

    "text": "Our dining adventure continues through Downtown Summerlin. Public school 702 offers Brunch on weekends along with the regular menu. The restaurant is a large space with an enormous outdoor patio. Indoors the room has high ceilings and hard surfaces but was conversation friendly.  At check in we requested a booth and only waited a few minutes for one to be cleared. Service was prompt with our server offering water while we perused the menu.. Refreshments include bottomless Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. If you drink more than two it becomes a money saver. Review the large chalk board at the entrance if you are beer lover.  We chose the Ahi tuna Tacos as a starter. There are four to an order with avocado salsa, and lemon aioli served in crispy wonton shells. The Ahi Tuna was fresh and flavorful. The shells provided a nice crunch. Chicken Sausage & Cheddar Grits are on the Brunch menu and come with two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens and a beer sauce. The chicken sausage has a little heat and the entire dish is a nice mix that will fill you up.  Grilled Salmon with Summer Succotash is on the regular menu. Our server did not ask the degree of doneness for the salmon, however it was prepared to my satisfaction, cooked all the way through with nice grill marks. The salmon is served with roasted  vegetables, edamame, corn, squash and citrus butter. Public School 702 has a Happy Hour in the bar and extends to part of the patio. Since the patio faces east I would recommend it for when the sun move across the roof and adds some shade. Ceiling fans help with the circulation. The beer menu has a wide variety of choices.  A return visit is a must to further explore the offerings.",

Their fry sauces are one of a kind and delicious. Also tried one of their specialty lavender cocktails, which was delightful for the senses. My companion enjoyed his hot dog and complimented the beer selection.  We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken and it seemed they had a brief staff meeting as we were trying to get our check cashed, so my lack of one star on this rating pertains to speed of service. Luckily, we weren't on a time crunch, but if we were, I would not go back here for a quick lunch.",

I took one bite and that was the end of that. Way too spicy. My boyfriend was nice enough to switch meals with me. He had ordered a burger. I took one bite of that and couldn't eat it either! Too spicy! He agreed that both meals were spicy (and he likes spicy food). The waiter was kind enough to offer me a menu to order something else, but I declined because I knew I wouldn't find anything else I cared for.  We had no problem with the service. We were seated promptly and the waiter was attentive, always refilling our water glasses. The atmosphere is very cute and detailed with the school house theme. The menus, presentation of the dishes, and the plates themselves were very appealing and I wanted to take them home. However, it was WAY too loud in there. The room is extremely echoey to begin with, and they throw loud music and TV noise on top of that. I truly felt like I was back in a school cafeteria (that's not a good thing). Bottom line, I would not return.",

It's only $3.50 so I'm not trying to fret about it, but if you're parched from the Vegas heat, I would recommend ordering something else; a beermosa would have been the better choice.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile since it has consistently been getting good reviews. I went with my husband around dinner time on a Friday and we only had to wait 20 minutes which wasn't too bad.   The first thing you notice when you walk in is how unbelievably loud it is.  It was so loud the hostess was having difficulty communicating where to seat people.  They walked a little ways in, and it started to get quieter, but then we were seated directly under a blaring speaker.  We still managed to get in some dinner conversation, but it did detract from the experience overall.  We ordered the chorizo mac and cheese as an appetizer.  It came practically within a minute of ordering it, which was great for timing, but it also means it was already prepared and waiting for us to order it. I'm not even sure they had to mix it based on how fast it came. The mac and cheese alone was actually pretty boring.  Adding the potato chips gave it a crunch and depth of flavor that helped.  The chorizo was pretty standard, nothing spectacular.  If you managed to get all four things on your fork at the same time it was good, but not great.    Because the appetizer was out so quickly, we waited about 15 minutes for entrees after the appetizer was finished.  My husband had the steak salad for his entree.  It was supposed to have a white truffle vinaigrette on it.  He assured me that it did lightly taste of truffle, but honestly I couldn't taste it myself.  Perhaps my flavor palette is off.  The salad overall was tasty and had a bunch of different things mixed in.  We ordered the steak med-rare and it came med-well, but it was still delicious.  I ordered the stout braised ribs as my entree and it was fantastic.  The ribs fell apart as soon as you put your fork to them, the gravy was so flavorful, and it was all served on top of yukon gold mashed potatoes.  It was absolutely wonderful.  When the bill came it was over $60 which I think wasn't consistent with the experience I had there.  At those prices, I will head next door to Fogo when it opens for lunch.  I may go back to try out \"recess\" which is their happy hour, but I will not be returning for dinner.",

We were suggested a few favorites from the staff... so we ordered every recommendation. The chicken sandwich with truffle fries was to die for...all the amazing flavors from sweet to a kick of spice and combined with the truffle fries...Omgee!!! Your mouth was exploded with the variety of flavors...the shrimp & grits- who would think of having that.....I tell you it was the bomb!!! You were right Jane...writing this review is having me craving for more!!! The highlight of our dinner was the manager Jane!!! She was awesome at answering all our questions and made our experience more memorable with her upbeat and positivity!! Thank you Jane and your Team!!",

    "text": "Normally I write about excellent experiences & places in Las Vegas you absolutely need to visit. Sadly, today that isn't the case. Public School 702 in Downtown Summerlin was one of those places we had on our list a long time. Ryan works crazy hours sometimes & my mom doesn't get to visit as much as she use to. So when we were all three available for brunch we headed to Public School 702 after hearing some wonderful things!  Things started out really well. We chose to sit outside & the view was stunning. It is up on the second floor.  Our server was very nice- he took our drink orders & they were brought promptly. Unfortunately...he was gone 10-15 minutes before he even came to take our food order. Now- we actually weren't too upset. Maybe they were shorthanded. Maybe they were really busy. But either way- it is what it is.  When our food did arrive- mom & Ryan had a really good meal.  As soon as I saw my meal & poked it with a fork...I heard it crinkle. I started pulling out shrimp shells...several of them. & pieces all throughout. We flagged down a busser & asked if he could snag us a water since again we couldn't find him & no one had come to check on us. Another 10 minutes later- he showed up. He then went to get the manager. 10 minutes later the manager said I could order something else. For anyone keeping track- I'd been sitting there with inedible food for nearly 30 minutes (if not more) so mom & Ryan had both long since finished their food.  They didn't offer a refund & the scariest part was that the manager wasn't bothered whatsoever. I don't know if this is a normal occurrence...or if they just didn't care. I sat & waited for another meal because I was being polite for my mom who really felt bad for me. I have low blood sugar & was just really disappointed in the entire experience. Nothing was apologized for & nothing was adjusted. We waiting another full 20 minutes until they brought me a meal. & then we left. So disappointed as I've heard wonderful things. After being there for over an hour & a half...we were all ready to leave. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else.",

I also like the atmosphere here which is one of the best in Vegas for groups. I'd bet their long, raised wooden tables can fit ten people on each size. With eight or less you can easily talk to and see everyone.   My partner and I had been dieting all week so we wnt a little overboard when we came by here last and tried the following:  PB&J Burger: too much P and not enough J for my liking. I fixed this by asking for a side of Jelly but I don't think I would do this again.  Chorizo Mac & Cheese: Probably the best thing I have had here. I loved this!! Bacon Cheddar Tots: YESSSS, finally cheddat tots that are actually tots and not just fried cheddar Burger Bites: A regular burger, was good but not amazing Margarita Pizza: Will do this again! Was good.  Side of Fries: So unmemorable I don't even know what they were called. They has some kind of spices on them though and I ate them all.   The only thing I recommend NOT on happy hour would be the velvet crush. It's like a raspberry Moscow Mule and it is delicious.",

The Eggs Benedict pizza was enough for two people.  It was delicious and flavorful!   It had ham, roasted brussel sprouts, cheese and fried eggs placed on top.

He apologized and brought out the soup that had obviously been sitting for 19 to 15 minutes and it was cold along with a cold grilled cheese sandwich.  The manager came out and apologized and asked if there was anything else they could do.  I suggested they bring out the rest of the meal - which they did - it was also cold.

    "text": "First time here today with a group of friends for Valentine's Brunch! The theme of Public School is so darn cute! From the blackboard/chalk writings on the walls, their composition menus, binder paper napkins, and more! Such a fun theme especially for adults, getting that feel of old school memories while drinking some beers from the bar. Anyway, great vibes. I especially love that after eating inside, our group went to their outside patio and played some beer pong, life size connect 4 and life size Jenga! We came in and stayed from 11am-4pm.   Oh shoot I totally forgot to mention the food!!! Anyway, food was awesome! LOVED their chicken & waffles!! Gotta have that for brunch. Also great to share! My boyfriend got the stuffed French toast so we shared with each other. His order was a little too much on the sweeter side than I prefer, but it was still good! Our whole group also got bottomless mimosas - which carried us onto the outside patio for more drinks to come haha.   ~~~ in my update for my review I just wanted to give a shout out to the service my friends and I received today. Honestly I always feel so terrible whenever I go to restaurants with a large group. I understand how large groups could be difficult esp in a setting where drinks are involved.. well today Emilia was our waitress and the entire time, she was super happy, energetic and just really took care of us (keep in mind our group was about 23 people) even when things were getting complicated, esp at the end when we were handling the check and everyone wanted to split it, she never showed that she was bothered or stressed. I have never experienced that with a server while having a big group before, so thank you so much Emilia, you rock. Don't change! ~~",

There's even a ceiling made out basketball/volleyball court hanging above the bar. The place looks great for happy hour, especially with the NBA Finals going on. However...  Food and Service: I wish I had the opportunity to try some food. Hell, I wish I had the opportunity to even order food. My girlfriend and I sat down in the bar area tables during happy hour. We literally waited 15 minutes (I timed it) and not a single waiter or waitress stopped by and asked if we wanted water, drinks, food, etc.   We walked out, with insult to injury added by the hostess telling us to \"have a good day\", seemingly unaware that we literally sat at the table staring at each other for 15 minutes.

Bison burger was good, though my medium came to me closer to rare. Wife said her steak salad was good. Beer and cocktail menu are very good.   Service was so-so. We had reservations, but still got seated in one of the worst tables in the house right by the main entrance. Uncomfortable metal chairs, wobbly table.  Also, our main courses were served 5 minutes after they dropped our appetizers. Hate that.   Ambience is PS 702's real weakness. This place is cavernous, uninspired in its decor, bizarre in its traffic flow, and ridiculously, jarringly, loud. I mean, can't-hear-the-people-at-your-own-table-loud. Punctuated by unexplained buzzer alarms like you might hear just before the nuclear meltdown.  I'm glad we gave it a try, but doubt I'll be back. Although the food was pretty good, the environment made me feel I was rushing through a meal at a theme park food plaza. Not for everyone, I suppose.",

Their menu and beer selection is good and there are some unique items but at the end of the day, it's just another Yardhouse, BJs, etc. Vegas has a million of these places already so it really didn't stand out in any significant way. The theme and decor are pretty cool though so that was a bit of a different spin on things. I had the shrimp and grits, were were tasty and a portion that was a decent size. My wife had the Chicken and Waffles were were a large portion and very good. Father-in-law had a jalapeno and pepperoni pizza that he liked and mom-in-law had fish and chips...they looked nice and she said they were OK. That's the good. Now time for the bad.  Service was OK but not great. It was a busy Friday night but still...not the best. My meal really wasn't very hot considering it was being served in a skillet so my bet is that it was sitting under a heat lamp for a few minutes. It was just hot enough to eat and not cold enough tow warrant sending it back but it should have been hotter. While they do have a decent selection of brews, their prices were really high for what you were getting. Once you start charging $9+ for a pint, that's getting to be a bit obnoxious, regardless of what kind of micro-brew it came from.   All of that is insignificant though by comparison to the noise. Let me make this as clear as possible. This place is SO FUCKING LOUD!!! I've been to Metallica concerts that weren't as loud as eating in this place. Seriously, if you are planning on having any form of conversation during your meal, you need to bring a bullhorn and set the volume on that sucker to 11. If you are not planning on having a conversation, ear-plugs should be mandatory. When we all left, it felt so pleasant to just hear a little silence for a few minutes. The noise alone is the reason none of us would ever return, so in case you missed it the first time, this place is FUCKING LOUD INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and meatballs for appetizer. It was very good. For the entrees we had the chef's special french toast and another dish with grits (can't remember the name). Both dishes were very good. Our server was super attentive. Would definitely recommend this place.",

Music is not good, not cozy I guess! The food is ok, calamari was too salty, the meatballs were not so good with linguine, we were told it's spicy and we said it's ok but the flavoring and the consistency of food does not go well with too much spicy. Cute coke in a bottle drink, fried chicken waffles were OK, I've tasted better! Dessert is ordinary and simple. So all in all nothing to look forward to, I don't even like beers and most of their alcoholic drinks are beer and wine, I wish they have fruity mixed drinks as an option!! I gave 2 stars for location. Will probably not go back here until they upgrade their menu and music",

I'd probably be willing to eat crickets if they were truffle soaked. Anyway,my bf orders pepperoni pizza and I'm disappointed because it doesn't sound exotic. When it arrives it looks delicious and I'm no longer upset with him. My truffle salad looks amazing too but I'm let down because I really hardly taste the truffle :( his pizza was amazing. Though!

The beer selection had a nice variety! They even offered a few tasters. For apps we really enjoyed the buffalo cauliflower& cheddar bacon tots. Blue cheese at this place is delicious too! Another starter that I really enjoyed, but my family didn't was the heirloom tomato watermelon salad. Really refreshing, but different! For entrees the fig& prosciutto pizza was good. Loved the balsamic reduction drizzled on top, but didn't love how hard the crust was. My sister said her tacos were great, and my dad enjoyed the fish& chips. For dessert we had the Nutella cookie sandwich.. there was too much bacon brittle on it for all of us. We did still manage to eat the cookie& ice cream parts though. Overall! The service, menu, location,& atmosphere will have me coming back for sure! Yay.",

We didn't complain but when our server realized what had happened she immediately sent the manager over who came to make sure we were having an ok time.

Keep in mind we almost left because of the long quote.  We sat down at the bar and were given menus immediately.  After the menus went down the attention went away.  It seemed the staff behind the bar was more interested in sampling the beers on draft than they were servicing the patrons.  We finally were asked if we had been helped and put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and ordered a cheese platter.  After 10 minutes at the bar we were texted that our table was ready...??  definitely the door needs help quoting parties accurately.  We had to cancel the cheese platter and went to our table outside.  The outside and inside are 2 different animals.  The inside was very loud and reminded me of a college bar atmosphere.  The outside was much quieter and enjoyable.  We ordered the cheese platter, the hummus platter, and the chop salad.  All dishes were great and portions were more than enough.  The server was very friendly and noticed my wife from another visit.  Only issue I had was that she spent too much time chatting with other tables and it hurt the refills of our wine and ordering process.  There seemed to be A LOT of staff at the restaurant.  All in all I loved the food and the concept is unique.  If given the choice and the weather is favorable go for the patio booths.",

    "text": "We had a six top for a 6:30 reservation, table had four chairs looking into the setting sun.  Youser! Two employees said they were sorry but nothing got fixed.  The metal chairs were the worst chairs ever in the history of restaurants, owee.  The service was c- at best, one person at our table had to school, no pun intended, the server on the beer selection.  Once all the meals were ordered we did two appetizers, the cauliflower and the tots.  Tots were great, cali was good.  The tots came out 30 seconds prior to our first dinner plates.  I have to say all the food was not hot, mostly warm.  Not good.  The food tasted good and the presentation was good as well.  We ordered the giant cookie for desert, one plate for six of us????  Ok then, it was good though.  Overall food was good, warm at best, service well below average, loud and uncomfortable.  We probably will not return.",

The atmosphere inside and out is fun with beer pong, big jenga, shuffleboard and TVs. Service can be a little slow at times and if you sit by the bar it will be loud.",
