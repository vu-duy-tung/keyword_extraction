My girlfriend choose the Sausage biscuit w/gravy, poached eggs.  Everything came out prompt and tasted spectacular.  It's been a while since my first visit to The Griddle, but I must say that it beats the Original Sunrise Cafe hands down, and makes the very top of my breakfast list for that area of town.",

    "text": "Honestly, I don't know why the average rating for this place is so low. Griddle is my \"go to\" breakfast joint in Las Vegas. They have the most solid food of anywhere I have been in town. You usually have to wait a little while on the weekends as they don't have a huge number of tables.  But, trust me, it's worth it. Overall service is friendly & prompt. The menu isn't crazy creative but it has all the good All-American breakfast/lunch choices. The pancakes are awesome but I always have to get the biscuits & gravy instead because the Griddle is the only place that makes them right (in my opinion). As a girl who relocated from Oklahoma, I am particular about my \"southern\" dishes and I'm here to tell you... The biscuits & gravy at The Griddle are the best in all of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Overview:  It was a Saturday morning on Labor Day weekend and all the Breakfast spots were packed.  We went from full parking lot to full parking lot till we got to the Denny's on Eastern.  Yes, I'll admit it, I eat at Denny's.  When you've worked a 12 hour night shift at the hospital, sometimes you just want some greasy stuff piled up high on your plate with some pan cakes and syrup.  Since the Denny's on Eastern was also full, we drove by wondering where we should try next when we spotted The Griddles sign and pulled in.  Location:  Get off on the 215 at Eastern heading south.  It will be on the Left a bit past Denny's and the gas station.    Exterior:  This place is small with a few tables outside.  You could almost miss it.  Interior:  There are booths on both walls and high tables and stools down the middle.  Nothing Fancy here.  Very bare bones.  Service:  We were given immediate service and our food and drinks came out very quickly.  I did not take the time to check my tab as others have suggested.  Maybe next time I'll take the time to do so just to see.  The price didn't seem out of control, so I assume they got it right.  Food:  Your standard American breakfast affair.  Not the hardest thing in the world to cook up.  They got eggs, meats, pan cakes, and the standard guest.  I was happy to see real fresh squeezed orange juice.  It wasn't that American cheese orange of your store juice.  This was a deeper orange with bits of pulp floating on top.  The taste was a bit tart, but like biting into an orange.  If it's not fresh, then I need to ask them what brand it is, cause its good.  My choice that morning was chicken fried steak.  Their version comes with the white gravy, a pile of potato cubes (home fries), eggs made to order, and toast.  It didn't seem like a lot, but it was very filling and satisfied my breakfast cravings.  Taste wise, it was okay.  The chicken fried steak was average, the gravy didn't blow me away, the home fries were equally adequate, and my toast was burnt.    Summary:  Overall an average breakfast spot.  I've actually ate better at an Ihop or Denny's.  Service was speedy and the bill was very reasonable.  Great Orange Juice, okay food.  The fact that I didn't have to wait to be seated or have a problem finding a parking spot was the bright spot.  That in and of itself pushed me up to 4 stars.",

The service is passible, the staff isn't super-quick and we had to flag him over a few times for refills.  The food is excellent, tho! We both ordered the Lumberjack, and once I ordered bacon, the next AM, the sausage patty. GET THE SAUSAGE PATTY! It was beyond delicious! The bacon was dissappointing, soggy limp and pre-cooked. The cooks know how to make a perfect over-medium egg, and that's big in my book. The home fries tasted and felt like they were cooked in bacon grease, but that's GOOD! They were really delicious. The pancakes were the best part of breakfast, tho! They tasted NOT from a mix batter, but from scratch. A bit tangy with buttermilk, they were massive, fluffy and chewy. They serve real butter here for them, but maple-flavored syrup. (none of the REAL stuff, sad to say)  I like the food beeter here, than at The Origional Sunrise Cafe, just a few blocks away. They make a MUCH tastier pancake, and really good coffee, too!  I'm be going alot more in the future, I know it! BTW, the picky family members I took loved it as well, even more than I did!",

The place was a little smaller, but on a chilly Monday morning there were only a few booths filled. Service was quick, but I was disappointed that they didn't have hot chocolate available since I'm not a coffee drinker and I needed a warm up. I ordered the signature buttermilk pancake along with 2 eggs, bacon and an OJ. The pancake was pretty large, and cooked perfectly. Eggs and bacon were good as well. A simple breakfast done well, leads me to want to return for something fancier. Maybe they could up there drink game a bit would be my only suggestion.",

I think we arrived around 10:45am and weren't seated until 11:15am. Not horrible for a Sunday breakfast rush but check out the farmers market in the parking lot while you're waiting. Cool tasty goodies over there for sure that help pass the time. They are a little slow at getting drinks to your table but everyone was friendly and professional. Very small place maybe only about 20 tables total. But I will definitely hit this place up again soon.",

They were so disappointing that I didn't have more than two small bites.  They were too mushy with not enough crisp on the outside.  Bummer.    Now for the real let down.  My husband ordered the country fried steak.  He was actually enjoying it until...   A HAIR was found in it.  That completely ruined our appetites and breakfast was over.  So tip #3... Wear hair nets in the kitchen please.    I will say that our waitress was very friendly and courteous.  We didnt say anything about the hair to her.  We were just ready to leave.    I don't see us coming back anytime soon.  Real bummer.",

Sometimes we get a lunch item such as the BLT with avocado and fries.  Their fries are beyond delicious, I try not to eat too many :)",

We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and seared in a cozy booth. Ambiance was nice and they serve good coffee and always keep it coming. I had the chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs with fruit instead of potatoes. It tasted pretty good considering I'm from Texas and know good chicken fried steak. My cousin got a huge Lovers red velvet pancake which feeds 2 people. It was literally huge!! Pretty good considering it was less than $9. Prices are pretty reasonable for brunch. I will be back to try other items. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall good experience.",

We waited more than 30 minutes for food today that was brought out in separate rounds, and the waitress didn't so much as apologize for the wait or the inconvenience of food for two of us growing cold while we waited for food for our third party. And a $40 bill to boot. Probably won't be returning.",

Atmosphere is lively, friendly, peaceful. They close at 3 pm daily so take note of that. They also have a yelp check in special bonus.  So glad to have discovered this lovely comfortable place!",

I had a group of 5 and it took about 35 minutes for us to get seated. We had a few moments to look over the menu before we ordered our food.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was quite dry and more batter-y than chicken. It even had that frozen look to it, it didn't make it look all that appetizing. I ate it nonetheless because I was huuuungry, but the chicken itself tasted okay- wasn't anything to be amazed by. the waffle was nice, warm and fluffy. it was a good portion of food. I wasn't too thrilled about my meal but it did its job.  It was pretty busy when we went so I understand that the servers were in a hurry.. I totally understand so I will just say service was good..   I'm not sure if I would come back though, not a fan of breakfast food in the 1st place and was hoping this place would help change my mind.. but it's okay.. I'd recommend to first timers in the area looking for a solid breakfast place.",

If you're in the mood for biscuits and gravy I wouldn't have them here. It's the only thing I'm not a big fan of.  The potatoes here are so good! Nice big chunks with more of a roasted flavor. I love the the Gobbler skillet, it's my go-to. My husband likes the veggie scramble (gluten-free). Our food always comes out piping hot! *Expect a wait on Saturday & Sunday because of the car show & farmers market.",

So on our drive I looked up some mom and pop breakfast places because  I didn't want the typical Denny's or IHop. We got here exactly as they opened and were one of the first in 'nd the waitress was super attentive. Great personality and even at 8am was giving us great service. Told her we had never been, recommended a few things 'nd overall everything was beyond great! Definitely thought to myself, next time I come back to Vegas, I'm going to have breakfast here.  Fast forward to today, I stopped by again because it was that good the first time. And tried something different than the first time 'nd again beyond expectations. I HIGHLY recommend to go here. Great service, amazing food 'nd this time we weren't the first ones here 'nd came probably during their peak hours 'nd still only waited 5 minutes to get a table.",

Only reason it's 4 stars and not five is the small size of the restaurant and being so small it gets loud quickly. So minus a star for that. Other than that the staff are very attentive and accommodating to families with rambunctious and screaming children. The place has a pleasant feel to it however despite the size.  Parking is a struggle however due to its location of sharing its lot with several other stores in the area.  All in all it's worth it to eat here and have a nice experience.  Happy dining.",

    "text": "Chose this place based on Yelp reviews and for it's in close proximity to where I live. Located near Einstein Bagel/Brew Tea Bar.  Came in on a weekend afternoon, and the wait time was 15 minutes. My party was put at on outside table which was fine for the day since it was perfect weather. Inside seating would have been a longer wait, I assume.   Right when we were sat down, the waitress wanted to take our drink order. I didn't have a chance to see the menu, so I just got water.  Another waiter came back in a good amount of time for us to review the menu and order. I ordered the country skillet, and the other two people in my party ordered the chorizo skillet. I also wanted to check in on Yelp for the free buttermilk pancake.   Now here's what really annoyed me as a customer. I checked in and showed the waiter that I was checking in and I asked him if that was okay, but he wanted to actually see my screen showing that I checked in, which was fine. However after a pretty long wait for him to come back, my phone was dying and another waitress came by to ask if we needed refills on our drink. I asked her about the check in and she said I was all good to go. Our original waiter comes back and asks me if I checked in and wanted to see my phone again, and I already closed out of the app. Told him the waitress said it was cool and he just kinda stumbled off. Maybe he was busy in the back or something but he seemed irritated at the whole thing, short, and I never saw him as our waiter again lol.  Food came out in a timely manner, and it was good! I didn't really have any complaints other than some of the food items seemed like it was just warm, not hot. But it wasn't bad food.  Reason why I deducted one more spot is because they didn't tell us refills weren't free. Ended up spending around $12 on Orange Juice ($4/cup) thinking it could be refilled free of charge. This should be more clear next time, especially if the waiter is asking if you want a refill, it kind of implies that there would be no charge?  Good spot to try out, but wouldn't come back or go out of my way to eat here.",

    "text": "Looking at the positive reviews, I wonder if we ate somewhere else. We had their grilled cheese and breakfast sandwich. Cheese on both was horrendous, as if it came out of a can. Bacon was average at best. English muffin was dry. Potatoes were below par. Grilled cheese again tasted like something out of a can or a spread - I mean if it tastes wet something isn't right, was melted to a consistency like a fondue.   Service was also disappointing. Small restaurant was crowded with 3 waitresses working the floor. We asked for water and napkins which were forgotten about for over 5 minutes. When I left I had the disgusting liquid cheese and pieces of our sole napkin stuck to my fingers. After complaining about the cheese, the waitress was helpful and had a new sandwich with cheddar (as opposed to American) prepared. For this one reason, we give 2 stars.   With many good breakfast and lunch places in the neighborhood (even in the same strip mall), will not return.",

Once we saw the waitress, she asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside (we said outside) and got us menus. I settled for two red velvet pancakes while my brother had eggs and two pancakes (one red velvet, the other blueberry).  The portion was in the middle for me, not too big not too small. It was a lot more filling than I expected and had to take the rest home. Now I know I can get by on one and completely avoid the full stack option. The syrup that was on the red velvet was delicious, I loved how the syrup and the powdered sugar was presented in a criss cross pattern! The chocolate chips added another layer of flavor to the red velvet and thankfully they didn't go overboard with the chips.",

THE FOOD:  I ordered the crab cake benedict. I have to say it was amazing! My girlfriend ordered the gobbler skillet. The skillet was ok and the large cubed house fries were bland.  THE BAD: The coffee was mediocre and I do not recommend the biscuits and gravy. We ordered those and the biscuit was cold with a luke warm gravy that contained no sausage and overly peppered. Additionally they served it to us much later after the meal arrived.",

I totally wish we would have gone somewhere else.   We get there and the place was very crowded and awkwardly set up. Not the crowded were you are excited about how good the food must be because there are a lot of people, but crowded in the way where it was miserable to stand awkwardly at the door until someone sat you and the chaotic mess of seating people made the process really unpleasant.   When we sat down, we asked for a booth but the person told us that we would have to re-put our name on the list and wait again. We already waited for 30 min. We didn't want to wait again. So we sat uncomfortably at a table that was too small and way too close to the other tables for comfort. I could honestly smell the mans B.O next to me.   The food was nothing special and pretty bland. I got a skillet and pancakes and my girlfriend got a Greek plate. Our food was almost hard to finish because it was just large portions of bad food.   The people made us feel uncomfortable because they made remarks about how we ordered too much food and essentially started calling us fat. I felt really uncomfortable.   What a waste of a birthday breakfast. No thanks.",

When we sat down they immediately asked what we would like to drink, got that right away. Then we had to wait ten minutes while they took everyone else's order that walked in after us. Irritating to say the least.   Food came out in an average time but I wanted to ask for some hot sauce but couldn't get it out as the server ran away from us. Eventually someone came by and I asked (after already eating half my food) if we needed anything and she said she would grab it. I never saw it. I did see the check though.

Everything was quick and delicious! The workers there were very nice and friendly and props for the one waitress being able to be able to take on so many tables like that! I'm guessing the owner was there and was going around and checking on everyone as well! I'm definitely gonna be returning!",

This is where service started to change. When I seen the food sitting in the window I looked for our waitress she was walking towards it then stopped & sat down to take a women's order & chat a little. The male waiter then brought us our food. Last no refills on drinks but the male waiter had made a couple rounds to all of his tables but not our waitress. She just seemed a little out of it today. We were in a hurry so when she didn't come by with a check after we were done I had to walk up to the register. Not huge issues just would've been nice to have a more attentive waitress",

Anyways - inside is clean but service is slow and not very informative - when I ordered the side of 2 pancakes knowing it was our first time eating there the waitress should have told us that 1 pancake is already pretty huge - that info would've been nice!!!  The food took awhile and when it came it wasn't hot -  The food was OK - it's nothing special - the crab cake eggs benedict was a tad bit too fishy and the hollandiase sauce had no flavor - it was the same with the BF's biscuit covered in white gravy - the gravy was tasteless.....  The Red Velvet pancake with chocolate chips and cream cheese syrup was OK as well....I wouldn't order that again and if I did only 1 pancake is needed as a side and to share. The kid's chicken tenders and fries were good enough for her -  The BF's breakfast skillet was OK - but he didn't care to finish it which is unusual.... Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff - IDK - all I know is that if a place makes me wait longer than the normal time my food better be hot and a little salt added to the food does go a long way.....",

The server then charged it as a side order rather than just leaving the bill the way it was.   When we brought it to the attention of the hostess/cashier she was very rude and refused to listen when my mother tried to explain that the server charged for an extra side when it was supposed to be a fix for an item that was was not made right the first time. She preceded to argue and say that it was common sense on why we got charged for the bacon  even though we kept saying the server never told us it was going to be an extra charge. She then said she wasn't going to argue, we were \"embarrassing ourselves over the issue (we weren't) and continued to be rude and say we are no longer welcome back after she was rude and nasty to us.  I work in a restaurant and when we  mess up we fix it NO extra charge, NO changing your receipt without telling you.

We waited for our food to arrive at the table it took approximately 20 mins which was pretty fast. When we got our food the presentation of the food was ok, my moms plate looked all messed up and everything mixed together this was the meat lovers plate which came with biscuits and gravy, and it was all in the same plate and made it look messy. We began eating the food was good only after when we had to drown it in seasoning due to lack of flavor. The home fries, biscuit and gravy had no flavor at all we didn't even finish our food. It is pretty pricey for 2 plates of food that was not worth it to be $40. The only good thing was the freshly squeezed orange juice.",

Like most breakfast spots in town they get busy on the weekend mornings. We arrived before 9 a.m. and snagged one of the last tables.  Even though the name is Griddlecakes they offer much more. They also offer benedicts, skillets, and other egg and meat options. If pancakes are your thing then this restaurant will offer all of the options you are seeking.  My breakfast was the Crab Benedict with Home Fries. The benedict was made with seasoned crab cakes. The benedict was okay, but the home fries were not very flavorful. My husband had The Big Nevadan Skillet. He loved it and the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits on the side. His meal was a very large portion. We also used the Yelp check-in offer for a free buttermilk pancake. I really liked the pancake and will definitely get pancakes next time I come in.  The service was efficient during our visit. Our orders were taken quickly and delivered quickly. A waitress other than ours peeked in to make sure our orders had been taken and again after we had food she checked to see if we needed anything else. I like when restaurants work in a team so that no needs are overlooked.",

Took us a minute to see what we wanted and my fiance found out if she checks in on yelp you can get a pancake for free which is nice. So I asked if I can do two and was advised we couldn't. Now some places let you do more than 1 but I'm not going to complain about it. I order a meat mix with scrambled eggs and my fiance ordered sausage and eggs. Food came out quick. Pancake was good soft and fluffy. Her breakfast was good. However mine was not as good. Mine came with biscuits and gravy and the biscuits was dry and the gravy was bland. Other wise everything was good for a breakfast place.",

We've never had lunch, only breakfast.   As for the food, as a family we are constantly tasting from each other's plates. It doesn't matter what I've sampled, it's been very good. The skillet breakfasts, the breakfast burritos, the oatmeal, fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, home potatoes - all very tasty and cooked properly. My favorite cup of coffee, too.   The place is small and if you get there too late for breakfast, there may be a wait. But I really enjoy the cozy, small feel of the place.   I don't think you can go wrong with Griddlecakes.

I still have yet to try half of the places I've seen driving thru the area!  Griddlecakes is located in the same shopping plaza as Smashburger, Beach Hut Subs, and Pin Kaow Thai Restaurant. It's kind of tucked away in the back corner though, so it may be easy to miss without a little effort.  It's a small little place. It has a down home, Mom and Pop type feel to it. We were greeted as we walked thru the door and led to our booth. Our waitress was friendly and hooked up our drinks-pronto.  It didn't take long to decide what we wanted. I hadn't had a good skillet in a long while! So we both just ordered a couple of skillets. They weren't terribly busy, so our food came out pretty fast...and,damn, was it delicious! Portions were pretty good sized too!  Our waitress was attentive and friendly. We never had to wait for our drinks to be refilled. That is my waitress litmus test right there....if I have to wait a long time or have to hunt somebody down for a refill, it will reflect in my tip and Yelp! Fortunately, this place passed with flying colors!  I'm looking forward to coming back again and trying out more menu items, especially those omelettes! Mmmmmmmm....Omelettes!!  so...yea...this is an easy..  4 stars.",

Tasty enough, but not necessarily something I'd bother ordering again. Service was ok. They were quite busy. We also had to wait an unusually long time to receive our order. But the pancakes here (of which there are MANY different options) were quite tasty.",

They slammed our food on the table and seemed bothered when we asked questions. To top it off, one of the male servers made a racially inappropriate comment towards myself! I was in a mixed group of people - myself being the only Africa American in the group. When we asked for our checks to be split, the server brought over our checks and began to sort them out and hand out to all of us ... my card, in particular has a picture of myself on it so it was very easy to identify that it was mine. He then began to look at it and pretend to read the name on it and said, \"Here is Shaniqua's card!\" He looked directly at me! My name is Destiny Parks. I absolutely did NOT appreciate his racial slur. I then addressed the MOD Melissa or Melinda about the issue. She proceeded to tell me, \"I'm sorry he shouldn't have said that.. but his best friend is black. He didn't mean anything by it.\" I am extremely disappointed in my experience and will not be returning.",

Their outside tables filled quickly too. My Mom and I had the Veggie burger sandwich and Chicken Breast Pesto Sandwich - both were served fast, hot and delicious. Side salad I had with italian dressing was a large portion for being a side, and rich with baby greens. The cup of Cream of Potato soup my Mom had (she is not a \"cream\" soup eater, but gave it a shot) was hearty and flavorful, she really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back!",

First - if you are looking for The Griddle like the one in LA, this isn't it, so don't get your hopes up.  Now...  One of the easiest things to make tasty is probably a simple plate of bacon and eggs with toast.  The Griddle accomplished that.  I ordered two eggs over easy, a side of bacon, and wheat toast. I got everything I asked for, and it was all pretty good.  Coffee was fine and my cup stayed full during our visit.  The atmosphere was ok and the service was friendly.  Was there anything special about The Griddle? Well..... no. However, if you want something that is an alternative to IHOP or another sort of generic breakfast joint, this isn't a horrible option.",

However I must say their potatoes are awesome if you want to splurge. They have great streaming hot cups of coffee! I've also had their oatmeal bowl with fruit and granola that was super yummy and the presentation was great.  For lunch I've had their Mediterranean salad which is a huge bowl full of veggies, a scoop of hummus and pita bread. It's worth sharing cuz it's huge.  My bf likes their breakfast skillets but has been disappointed by their biscuits and gravy b/c they are always cold. Bummer.  The griddle is a good local place for brunch.

Service was decent - fulfilling the bare requirements of refilling my water and taking my order. Other than that, where's the conversation? Better yet, where is the smile?  Onto the food, I had ordered a breakfast concoction comprised of eggs, feta, spinach, and chicken. Pita on the side as well as potatoes, it was decent. The chicken was dried out, while the eggs were flavorless. I had a bite of my friend's breakfast burrito, which was good. However, my other friend's eggs and bacon looked dismal and...limp.  The one benefit of the Griddle is the location. Conveniently near the 215 and with a large parking lot, the store is easy to get to. The day I came, the doors were opened as to permit brunch fare to be eaten outdoors.  Honestly, other than the convenient location, there's not much bringing me back to the Griddle.",

Why you ask? It's because their breakfast entree's are the best you will get anywhere on planet earth! We make a point of coming here for that! This very morning (Sunday 9/7/2014) my wife had the garden skillet and I had my usual \"Lumberjack\" with 2 eggs, bacon, their unbeatable \"home fried taters\" along with 2 giant fluffy \"melt-in-yer-mouth\" pancakes topped with great tasting coffee. Oh man! There's simply no doubt that we had the best breakfast you'll find anywhere...even home cooking does not get better than this. Speaking of \"home\", this place is very homey feeling. Folks of all ages will be very comfortable here. Griddlecakes' specialty of course is their breakfast selections., I mean with a name like Griddlecakes you can expect that. But their lunch entree's are also exceptional. My pick is the breakfast menu only because I personally prefer breakfast. It's my all-time favorite food choice. My wife actually agrees with me on this one!  So if its the best homemade style breakfast you'll ever want for, this establishment is an absolute must. The prices?....very affordable for all budgets. This is a great place for families too, A new name....same owners.....same great food as always!",

Their posted hours on Sunday's are from 7am to 3pm. We live less than 2 miles from the Eastern location, so we left the house at 6:40. We arrived at GC at 6:50, parked and approached the front door just in case they were open for coffee for early risers. The temp was 38 degrees, so when we found the front doors locked, not wanting to wait in the cold shade, we returned to our vehicle to wait until 7am. The lights were on and their was a person in the kitchen who clearly saw us. The fact that they were not open early was no big deal. At 7am, an older lady tried to open the front door, but it was still locked. She stood and waited. 7:05 and 7:10 came and went, and GC was still not open. My wife and I decided that 7:15 was our cutoff wait time. At 7:12, the lady waiting at the door approached our truck and told us she eats at GC every Sunday, and they always open on time. She let out a frustrated sigh, and then got in her car and left. We left as well, severely disappointed that one of the now 2 people inside did not have the courtesy to come to the front door and let us know what the problem was, and what time they would be open. While we understand that people call in sick, or arrive for work late, there is no excuse for not letting loyal customers know what's going on.  My wife and I decided that it would be a long time before we try GC again, as there are certainly many other breakfast spots in the area that will value our patronage. We went elsewhere, and had a wonder breakfast anyway.",

I always enjoy when the servers let you linger a little on a Saturday morning after you're done eating so you can sip your coffee and enjoy the day...and they definitely did that here.",

Still no one said anything even though several employees walked past me. I ended up leaving without eating or even been acknowledged. Maybe I was invisible today.",

The first visit I had some egg and potato meal, the second visit I tried a veggie scramble. Both were tasty and a good size for one person.  The service was pretty fast, which is great if you're in a hurry for a sit down meal. However, I missed having a few smiles thrown into the service. The coffee mugs had some coffee stains on the outside and that also was a bit off.  There are a lot of seats for small groups. We went during prime brunch time and got a seat right away. In the morning, the shade covers the out doorseating, leaving it nice and cool.",

This breakfast hut is located in a busy mall with lots of shops so you just might miss it.  The decor is basic but it works.  There are about 7 booth style tables with some individual seating available off to the side and also in the middle of the restaurant. It's small but it works. You can also eat outside directly the store front. Watching the parking lot and pedestrians walk through the seating area.  They great you immediately with a smile and you basically seat yourself.   I consider myself a pancake expert. It's one of my major food groups. My thing is if it doesn't taste delicious without the syrup it's not a good pancake! I've had the s'mores, banana and the strawberry ones. They all past the no syrup test. The actual pancake is made perfect!  I know it's just pancakes but when you call yourself Griddlecakes you better have the best cakes on that griddle!   5 stars!",

It's small, so I can only imagine how busy it is on weekends. During the week we usually have no problem getting a table. The service is fast and friendly and they have a great selection. I have tried just about all of specialty pancakes - I think my favorite is probably the Blue Jay, which are lemon blueberry pancakes topped with whipped cream and blueberry compote. We are also HUGE fans of the breakfast burrito - I might go so far as to say it's the best I've had in town (taco shops excluded). We always add mushrooms and spinach to it and it's so delicious! Their potatoes don't look like much, but are really tasty. My only complaint would be just a general gripe about the pancakes - although they are tasty, they end up being tough most of the time. Like, not fluffy....anyhow, I enjoy them nonetheless.",

We ordered two different skillets and both were served at room temperature with the potatoes being hard as if they were burned when being cooked. Some of the pieces we couldn't even bite through... On one of the skillets the ABC there was supposed to be avocado which was not served with it, we asked for it later. I decided to bring up that the potatoes were burnt/crispy and they said oh yeah sorry they're not supposed to be that crispy... yeah i hope not because no one would order your potatoes! Finally they gave us 20% off of our check to compensate (wasn't necessary just would've liked better service in this experience) but they gave this to us on a Tuesday. Griddlecakes does 20% off of their menu on tuesdays regardless. Not a good first time experience, don't recommend it!  And looking at other customers photos it's frustrating seeing that the food could've been great & we were not able to have that experience. Instead we got burnt/day old potatoes.",

I had a side of biscuits & gravy, which went perfect with the skillet. See what you have to do is get a fork full of potatoes, beef, and bacon, and dip it in the gravy! DELICIOUSNESS!!! The orange juice is pulpy as all fucks, its like drinking an orange. But other than that, I loved the place. Friendly staff, even when slammed busy, and my water never got to empty. I will definitely be back again. Sooner than later!",

    "text": "YES 5!  I've been coming to this place since they've opened. Since then, I've tried pretty much everything, almost everything. Although they did change their name to \"The Griddle Cake\" thankfully it's the same owners and menu. They serve breakfast and lunch.   It's a small little restaurant that doesn't seat many, which is why it's always busy because it's really yummy! The atmosphere is just plain comfortable. You'll be happy and cozy.   Yesterday was New Years Day and also was our anniversary, so we decided to have our first meal of 2014 at this place! We walked in, there was a bit of a wait, but not too bad. Then ordered with our waiter, who's always on point every time we get him. Hubby got the Philly Cheese steak Skillet, which is mixed with the obvious the steak, lots of gooey cheese, veggies, home potato fries  and 3 eggs, he had them cook 2 scrambled and 1 sunny side up to top it on the steak skillet, oh and it also came with a huge side of Biscuits and gravey.  All the skillets come in large portions for an affordable amount which was around $10 or so.   I had a build your own omelette and I got an egg, cheese, sausage, tomato, mushrooms and green pepper omelette. Which came with home fries and your choice of toast again with an generous portion for about $9.00 or so. This omelette is fluffy and so flavorful. I love it.   And last but certainly not least. We had to get the short stack (should've gotten full) of The BEST red velvet pancakes!!! With Strawberries!!! These red velvet pancakes are the most buttery, soft, moist, fluffiest pancakes ever! They just melt in your mouth. They include chocolate chips in the batter and swirl chocolate syrup and powered sugar on top and sprinkle the sweet sliced strawberries on top with cream cheese frosting on the side. OMG my mouth is watering just typing this. Lol this place is a MUST!",

I ordered a single red velvet pancake, scrambled egg whites & turkey sausage Side Note: they don't have turkey bacon? Why not have both? Hmm whatever I guess. They brought out a buttermilk pancake :( nooo sir, red velvet. I know this wasn't my error because I've heard nothing but wonderful things about their red velvet & was looking forward to trying them. Server kindly took it back & brought back the red velvet one. No biggy it happens.  Now don't get me wrong it was alright. Pretty tastey but i'll be honest, I enjoy iHops red velvet a heck of a lot better. Personal preference though. This just wasn't sweet enough.   Like I said, nothing special about this place, very standard cafe with ok prices.",

The pancakes were chewy and had to be cut twice thru with a knife, my opinion is that you should only need the side of a fork to cut pancakes. The flavor was extremely lackluster, I'm almost positive they use bisquick  mix in the back... I can do that myself at home for much cheaper.  The bacon was also poor quality, and flavor. You can buy better bacon at Walmart. As for the \"two\" eggs, the portion was very small, and I'm sure was liquid egg. Considering the current egg crisis I can figure this. They were the best tasting thing on my plate.  The staff is polite and helpful, the location is small but clean-up but I will not be coming here again.",

Unfortunately, this place fell in the latter category. The service was lackluster, bordering on dismal. The food was average, nothing to call home about. I had the french toast, soggy like my mood. But the reason as to why I graced my presence on Yelp was because they overcharged my bill by 10 dollars and if I didn't catch it, they wouldn't have said anything. After confrontation, they did not apologize and just handed the check back to me with little more than an oops. I didn't expect anything, just a \"sorry\" would've sufficed.

    "text": "Cool little place, maybe 20-25 tables, with a nice bright decor and cheery feel. Almost felt like some of the main street cafes from the beach towns of Southern California.  The entryway situation was a little strange in that when you walk in you are staring right at a 2 person high-top table eating their breakfast and no host stand. Luckily, one of the servers quickly made eye contact and asked \"how many?\"  It could have been a little awkward if they were all busy and didn't see us for a few minutes. At the same time, there were no tables available and they did just fine. We waited for about 5 minutes and were seated.  Nice selection on the menu and the \"Build Your Own Omelet\" for $7.99 caught my eye right away. You get to pick 3 things to put in it for that price too, with a $.75 up charge for additional items...reasonable and to be expected especially when they give you three.   I opted for tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, turkey sausage. It came with breakfast potatoes that were very good (not all fried and greasy) and a buttermilk biscuit that was about average. Add a coffee to the mix and you have the makings of a delicious Saturday morning breakfast.   I will visit again for sure.",

Place was busy enough but thought they need to get some kind of noise cancelling artwork or something on the walls as it seemed extremely loud in the venue. I don't care to eat & have to cover my ears part of the time, yell at my dinning partner or ask them repeatedly to repeat themselves since I couldn't hear them. Now on to the food. I ordered the lumber jack plate which included 2 pancakes, 3 eggs, 3 sausage (or bacon) & fried potatoes. It was just OK. I'd have to say the pancakes were OK but I have had better pancakes at other venues. I didn't care for the sausage. It was extremely hard to cut as the casing seemed very tough. I'd much rather have sausage patties than links. I didn't really care for the potatoes. They were a little tough as they weren't cooked enough. I do have the say the glass of fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome. Service was great but unfortunately that's not enough for me to come back to the place. I like a few other breakfast places much better.",

    "text": "Terrible breakfast experience. On 10/20 (a Monday) three of us were there for breakfast. It took an hour to get our food (although we saw many others get their food more quickly), the bacon was microwaved, the gluten free waffle was just dough. During that hour no one told us why it was taking so long.  We watched a woman come in and order a to-go breakfast, come back in 15 minutes and pick it up (while we waited), at another table the two guests ordered after we did, then ate and were replaced by a single person who ordered and ate--all before we ever got any food. It was not just us that was suffering, however. A couple near us got their sausage until finished with their meal after waiting about as long as we had (customer refused the sausage).  After we waited 45 minutes or so a woman, purportedly the manager or owner, arrived and visited tables where she knew people and solved their problems---but not us--and not others, only table where she knew people by name. I have been there at least 20 times by the way--but would not consider myself a regular.   Food took forever and was terrible when arrived.  To add insult to injury the woman in charge deducted two cups of coffee from our $33 bill.  Did you hear that?  She thought it was ok to make us wait an hour, get uncooked food and then try to make ut up to us by comping two cups of coffee!   Who gives a guest two cups of coffee for to make up for that experience? I know who does that, its a restauranteur who should not be in business, that's who.   I have sent many people to this little place over the years...never again. In addition, neither I nor anymore in my family will darken their doors again. This business has not idea what they are doing.",

I've also had the pleasure of having a customized omelet, also oversized and plenty tasty.  You can tell the food is good because the last couple of times we've gone there's been a short wait.  It's a pretty small joint, so if they enjoy continued success maybe they'll be able to expand, especially since no other restaurants in that plaza can seem to stay in business.  Do not even think about having breakfast at the IHOP or Denny's right down the street when the Griddle is available.",

Got our drinks and ordered the Great Gobbler skillet with biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend ordered the Lumberjack Special. When we got our food, everything was still warm except for the biscuits and gravy which was very COLD! I wanted to let our waiter know but he didn't come back to us until we were half way done with our meal. When I was finally able to tell him that the biscuits and gravy were served cold, he didn't even apologized and just told me he'll get me a new one which NEVER CAME! I watched our waiter handle other things at the counter and return to his other tables but not ours. What did came was the check that was given to us by another waiter! So basically, the food was ok and nothing special - the home fries lacked a lot of flavor that me and my boyfriend had to douse them with salt and pepper and ketchup just to give it life. But getting a side of COLD biscuits and gravy ruined my experience plus having the waiter forget about replacing it made it clear that we picked the wrong place to dine. We will not be coming back here at all - we'll stick to Mr. Mama's where the owner was super friendly and the food tastes way better and served hot!",

I got one whole stalk of lettuce (was not chopped at all), it also had like a garden mix of salad and very little chicken and dressing. The garden spring mix of veggies was very over powering the dressing and even the romaine. The fries portion was small. The waiter even tipped over my plate and the french fries were all over the table. With that being said, he didn't even give new fries. I asked for ranch and the ranch tasted like the ranch from the Kroger bottle that you would get from the local grocery store.   My husband ordered a philly cheesesteak skillet type thing. There was only about 2 bites of meat on it and the rest was all potatoes. His dish was somewhat tasty. LOL We just wished there was more meat on it. He also asked for the gravy to be put on the side and the gravy was bland.   They had about 7 employees there. Some were just sitting and lounging around . We waited forever for everything!

They also offered a free pancake when checking in on Yelp. The french toast and Griddle Platter were very good. So I give the food 5 stars. The pancake was a bit overcooked and rubbery, but it was free so I won't consider it in our overall rating. The staff was friendly, but most of them are young and don't quite know proper food and beverage ettiquette. When my water was refilled they reached right over my plate to get to my water glass and condensation from the metal water pitcher was dripping all over my french toast. The server later decided to replace the jam condiment caddy that was on our table with a full one. I appreciate wanting us to have more jam, which wasn't needed because the original jam holder was more than half full, but she reached right between the two of us in the middle of our conversation to replace it and didn't say a word. I also had to tell them that they forgot to put peanut butter on my french toast, which they brought out later in a small condiment cup and still charged me for it. Not worth the additonal $1.99.   Overall the food I would give a 4.5-5 rating, friendliness of the staff and cleanliness of the cafe a 4 rating, and customer service know how and restaurant ettiquette a 3 rating. Overall rating a 4, but more like a 3.75 if I could give that as a rating.  The food was good enough to get us to come back again, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.",

My waffle was pretty good, but the eggs and chicken had to come home and were fed to my dogs later, they were just inedible (the eggs were dry and the chicken was sweet).  My husband had an omelet, which was okay.  Overall, our bill was $42 with tax and tip, which is just ridiculous for breakfast.",

Have also had the burger with roasted red peppers and avacado.  Tasty!  Smaller spot so timing is important.  Love that they have a few outdoor tables.",

I was excited to be able to order a breakfast meal at noon as well after a late night.    The place is cute, and was busy.  I ordered the Lumberjack (i believe it's called) which came with 2 HUGE pancakes, 3 sausage links, 3 eggs and potatoes.  The pancakes were DELICIOUS.  I highly recommend trying them.  I couldn't even finish half of the plate, but worth the $10 regardless!  I can't wait to go back and try one of their griddle plates!",

Way to many potatoes and not enough other ingredients on the skillet. The pancakes were fluffy and yummy and huge!  The biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were super fresh so they kinda turned into mush and not a lot (if any) sausage in the gravy. The wait staff was very attentive and interactive with the guests. I had a great experience and will go back to try more.",

    "text": "Griddlecakes. Just the name of the restaurant tempted me to drive across town to try this breakfast place, and reading the menu conveniently provided online was the final straw: I had to go here and get some Blue Jay pancakes!   My first disappointment was with the size of the place. When my husband and I arrived, we squeezed into the non-existent front area and tried in vain to find a hostess stand or even an employee to explain how the seating process worked. I finally walked to the back of the restaurant, found a random employee behind the counter, and got our names on a list. There is absolutely no place to wait besides outside because (1) the inside is TINY (2) it's crowded (3) the booths and tables come almost right up to the front door. So outside we went!   After a few minutes we were seated and brought two waters. Here began my next disappointment: The service here is terrible! There's about eight employees running around (which you think would be enough to serve the limited tables) but they all are either confused or just not attentive. We waited forever to order and then waited forever for our food.  And the final disappointment: The food. My blue jay pancakes, which I had drooled over so much when reading the menu, were just not that spectacular. The strawberries and blueberries were both unripe and hard, and the pancakes were chewy and tough. They definitely give you enough food though! If you're a light eater like I am, stick to one pancake.  Two stars because I think the concept of Griddlecakes was a good one, but the execution definitely is NOT.",

    "text": "Wandered into this place because it's right by my house. Went in and it was really busy so the only place for me and my 2 year old to sit was a small 2 top table. I'm not one to be picky so I took it. I still don't know who my server was because one person took my drink order, another took my food order, another brought the food, and I had to flag down someone else to get things and a different person brought my check. So I'm still pondering that one... I ordered a short stack, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy. The food came out in a timely manner but the girl who brought my food had attitude written all over her. The plates simply weren't going to fit in my tiny table so she kept rearranging things until I finally dumped some of my food into my daughter's plate and handed the girl the extra plate. She took it and walked off like she had better things to do. I had to flag another guy down for syrup and utensils. The only good part of all this was the pancakes. They are delicious! I stuffed myself full until I realized I still had biscuits and gravy which weren't that good. Nothing else tasted too special either.  The rest of the staff were nice, especially one older guy who finally noticed my daughter sitting on her knees after we got our food, and offered a booster seat and fixed the wobble in our tiny table.  I doubt I'll return...which is a shame because I really liked those pancakes.  As a restaurant manager I firmly believe service is EVERYTHING. Get it together guys, it'll make a world of difference :)",

We were not let down in the slightest! Wife had the eggs Benedict(Rebel style) and I had the grilled chicken/bacon sandwich. We also ordered a small stack of griddlecakes(seeing as the place is CALLED griddlecakes). The pancakes crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Adding the whipped butter they were heavenly. My wife's eggs Benedict were amazing and I enjoyed my sandwich. One of my favorite things about this place was the service. Everyone in the restaurant was there for us. The only criticism I have is that the staff should introduce themselves. Other than that this is an excellent place to have a nice breakfast or lunch.",

I went in to pay with my card and they didn't even check my ID. What was the point of not being able to use my card over the phone if they weren't even going to check my ID? And besides who would place a order that would be delivered to a place of business and use someone else's card without their knowing? I get it but none of that made sense.

Plenty of parking and entry/ exit way.  b.  Ambiance - 3 star - A bit small, I think there must be about 12 tables inside and 3-4 outside. Way too small for people wanting breakfast and nowhere to sit. They cannot control their waiting line very well as there is nowhere to sit or stand.  c.  Food - 3 Star - I know I said it was pretty good, however, it is spartan at best. I ordered a made to order omelette with some veggies, jalapenos and peppers with egg whites.  Why they don't have a veggie omelette is odd and why charge me .50 per ingredient?  The omelette was small.  I did not want the home fries and asked for fruit. It was very little bits in a very small cup.  d.  Price - 2 star - So, why serve an omelette that looks like it was made with two eggs? Why serve it on a plate with lots of extra room, If you can count the pieces of bits on the plate, that means there is way too little. Only the toast seemed to be filling the plate.  I did not get my value for dollar theoretically as my cousins paid for breakfast.  e.  Service -1 star - Here is the biggest failing!  The service here is very poor. They do not come often to fill coffee, never remembering if you had decaf or regular. I had to ask for water twice and then ask them ask for refills. They cannot handle the wait line on a Sunday with any efficiency.  Really a poor way to go in my book.  GK says, this place could be great if they were efficient and organized and gave you value for your dollar.  I may go back, mainly because hanging with my cousins was awesome!",

We approached the podium and several waiters and waitresses asked to hold for just a minute. A hostess came out took count and quickly found us a booth inside. Given that I had never been here I quickly started to read the yelp reviews and man I was ready for horrible service as that's what most of the gripes seem to be. The whole place was extremely busy but I like other reviews our server was on point and on top of everything. Our meals came out in parts not sure if that was normal but our server made sure everything came out hot and timely! I had my kids split a lumberjack meal and I had the big Nevadan my wife ordered the monkey business cakes. The Nevadan was awesome and packed of flavor!! The lumber jack was also stupendous my kids practically licked the plates and my wife's monkey business reminded me of an Elvis type sandwich which was amazing! Thanks Griddlecakes for an awesome experience",

It was a special and they are called Griddlecakes. The pancakes were gross. Chewy and gross. They seemed uncooked. My kids didn't care for them at all.

Then when the order reached the table ,we had to summon someone to get our silverware and then later some napkins. The white chocolate with raspberry pancakes tasted like plain pancakes with a drizzle of rashberry sauce over it,the red velvet pancakes did not have any strawberries over it (though the description had it )and we got it only when I pointed it out. The lemon blueberry pancakes were definitely tasty though. In short we were very disappointed with the food and the experience of the restaurant. I don't think we would recommend it to anyone in the future.",

The chicken was flattened, almost like chicken parm style, and had a breading perfectly suited to the side of buffalo hot sauce they provided when I asked (tasted like Frank's, as it should!). The waffle formula was excellent. A co-worker had the El Jefe and devoured the whole plate quickly, and another co-worker had a medium burger with jack cheese and mushrooms and was super happy. They split the check without any issue, and we all walked out stuffed and satisfied. This will have to become a regular part of our lunch rotation. You can sit inside or outside. There are a lot of great restaurants at this location, so if you are coming for lunch you might want to get here a little early to be sure you can find parking.",

Prices are awesome and the quality of the food is impeccable. I highly recommend their chicken and waffles :) We also brought our puppy to enjoy breakfast with us. Our waitress was so thoughtful and even brought out a food/water bowl for us. We ate outside and the breeze felt AMAZING!!

I've been here at least half a dozen times before and enjoyed everything I have ordered.   That being said... Why I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5. Sometimes the service is slow. Not really the waiter is slow, the kitchen. I've always had wonderful waiters and my drinks are always filled and when I ask for something, I have it right away. The food takes a little longer than I think it should.... But.... The food is always hot, fresh, and wonderful. So all in all I am extremely impressed.   Ok so not so short..... Thank you to Antonio this afternoon.... He was an awesome server!!!",

The waffles were perfectly cooked to a golden flaky finish and in a shape that you can easily pull apart and dunk in syrup...kids can share with ease. The syrup is good too! The wings had a good flavor with that perfect crunch. Oh the pancakes are HUGE... One is enough for an adult or split a stack. FRESH squeezed OJ...

Both times we had something off the breakfast menu (they have a lunch menu as well) It's a cute space and it looks clean.. They definitely have room for improvement.. I would say for new guests who don't really know how the seating goes. But over all it's been a positive and good experience! =)",

    "text": "I wasn't in a socializing mood this weekend, so I opted for a to-go order.  I typically go for pancakes, but I was feeling more savory so I got The Big Nevadan instead.  Unfortunately, I was extremely unsatisfied.  My first issue was a discrepancy with the menu.  It says on the description for skillets that they are served over 'home fries' but once I got home and opened the box, this was certainly not the case.  The 3 eggs your way were there, along with the beef, bacon, and toast...but no fries were in sight.  I justified the price point of $13.99 because it seemingly came with more than enough food.  As far as flavours go, everything was lacking.  Eggs can be salted/peppered easily, but beef not so much.  It specifically says on their menu that the beef is seasoned however all I tasted was bacon.  The toast was satisfactory, but it's toast.  That's not hard to mess up.  I know that their pancakes are good, so if I'm wanting those I'll come here in a heartbeat.  If you're a savory gal/guy, then venture somewhere else.",

However that's where my excitement stopped.   Service: We got seated pretty quickly, but then it took them a really long time to take our order. A family of 4 got seated at the same time and had ordered and received their food before we placed our order.   Food: I ordered 1 protein oatmeal pancake topped with pecans, 1 French  toast, and a side of bacon. My mom ordered 1 blueberry lemon pancake and made it a combo with  scrambled eggs and bacon. Unfortunately I had to send my French toast back because there was no flavor to it. The butter had more flavor than the actual French toast. It looked very under done and was very bland. I replaced it for another protein oatmeal pancake. The pancake wasn't bad, very light in flavor though. I was expecting a bigger flavor explosion and was disappointed.  I had a bite of my moms blueberry lemon pancake and that one was good! You could really taste the lemon.   I wouldn't say coming here is a must when visiting Vegas, but if you do get the blueberry lemon.",

We ordered the fried chicken and waffle, crab benedict, some pancakes on the side (& a few build your own omelets). Everything tasted pretty good. The best thing on the table was the crab benedict. The home fries aren't super consistently made but I'm sure you can request how you'd like them done.  I ordered the fried chicken and waffle and it was good but the chicken was a little dry. And the waffle could've used a little more time to be cooked.   Service wise- they're pretty fast and they definitely check up on you for refills and everything.   It's worth checking out especially for some pancakes that are pretty specialized!",

    "text": "Meh. The food here is fine, but not great. The service is horrible. There are so many great breakfast places in Vegas I truly recommend skipping this one.   I came on a weekday morning, and was able to be seated immediately, so that was nice. That was about where the pleasant experience ended. The restaurant inside is very small and they could probably stand to have more seating in the future as it would have avoided the major problem that I ran into. After we had already been seated a larger party came in and they didn't have enough room to seat them all together. The staff proceeded to seat them separately but it was clear the family was waiting for us to move so they could have our table. The staff was very obviously rushing us, and seemed more progressively annoyed when we were not ready to leave immediately. At this point our food had been out of the kitchen for less than five minutes, it's unreasonable for you to expect us to leave at that point, already asking if we need to go boxes, and if we're ready for the check. Insane. Not to mention the service we were able to get was not great, drinks were forgotten, and the sides and sauces we asked for made it to the table 20 minutes later. Service aside this place wouldn't have been bad. Everything we ordered was OK but nothing was spectacular, everything just needed a little extra seasoning or sauce once it got onto the table. The best thing that we ordered was pancakes not surprisingly as their pancake restaurant. The eggs Benedict was the next best thing. I highly recommend you skip the biscuits and gravy altogether, they were nasty and a complete waste of the order. Overall, I just think this Restaurants's staff needs better training and they would be far more successful.  Also, keep in mind that the restaurant offers discounts and freebies in exchange for yelp reviews. So take the positive reviews here with a grain of salt.",

We decided to eat outside because it was a beautiful morning. Our waiters (we had a few lol) took our orders quickly. I had the Gobbler skillet. It was awesome. The cheese was melted exactly how I like it and veggies were soft with a little crispness. The eggs were slamming. Hubby had the Western skillet loaded with hot sauce as seen in the photos! The kids had your basket eggs, pancakes and meat. They enjoyed ! When we were ready to leave the waiters got all of our dishes, quickly presented bill, we paid and were out of there. Just how I like it. I am sure this place gets super busy. Its very trendy and I would highly recommend this place for meeting friends too. Not just a family place but a place to sit outside with your computer and get some work done with a cup of coffee.",

We ordered 2 \"build your own\" griddle cake combos. I got the lemon blueberry pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon and some coffee. The pancakes were perfectly cooked and not too sweet like most places.  The only downside to this restaurant was the pricing. I don't have a problem paying good money for good food but we got 2 Griddlecakes combos (pancakes + eggs+ bacon x2) and it was almost $40.  Also, the service did leave room to be desired. The waiter was nice enough but kind of seemed not happy to be at work ( but who is though haha?). And we had to ask for refills on our drinks. All in all it was a pretty yummy and solid breakfast but I do feel that for what it was it was overpriced.",

    "text": "Take it from a guy who has nearly made it his life goal to explore the various hidden breakfast  gems in the Las Vegas / Henderson valley. Now, I have thoroughly examined and assessed every review on Yelp regarding GriddleCakes ranging from Amazing to awful, however, I have yet to find an accurate description to acquiesce the fact that \"good\"'or \"bad\" reviews even exist. Simply put, GriddleCakes is relegated to neither categories in which it is claimed. GriddleCakes is its own special entity whose Identity need not be subject to opinion. Fact. It is a fact that GriddleCakes is its own, indescribably remarkable establishment. When you walk through those doors, it takes no time to realize that this is not your typical cafe. This family-operated phenomenon has the unique, diverse multicultural \"zing\"  while maintaining an extraordinarily cozy, home-like atmosphere that really, in itself,  is a spot that a simple cup of freshly brewed coffee can be enjoyed in solace followed by a genuine conversation with someone who isn't just there to serve you eggs. I mean, you walk into this place and you know you are where you need to be. Their quality of food could go from extraordinary to just great and it would still surpass the rest. No review can do justice, no picture, no comment, no opinion. GriddleCakes, like the Grand Canyon, Cosmos, The Great Pyramids of Egypt or The Northern lights, are indescribable experiences that must be just that; experienced. Do yourself a favor. Go Get GriddleCakes. You will never look back.",

    "text": "Small breakfast/lunch spot located off of Eastern in Henderson. Griddlecakes offers inside and outside seating, the booths go fast! The tables in the middle of the restaurant are a bit small and you feel a little packed in if its a full house. On weekends there is usually a wait up to 20 minutes. Staff is very friendly but it did take about 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. The food has always been great in my opinion (and very reasonably priced). I always order the tuna melt- one of the best I've had! My husband usually makes his own omelette and staff was accommodating at subbing potatoes or toast for oatmeal (most breakfasts spots do not for some odd reason). This is one of my go-to restaurants on the weekends, great gem in Henderson!   Hours: 7:00am-3:00pm",

It's very confusing as you walk in and you don't know if you should take a seat or walk to the back counter for service. So I went to the back and asked a male server and he said to just sit where Id like. The only unoccupied table was at the front and had dirty dishes on the table. I told him the table was dirty and he then said that someone would soon be with me. It took 10-15 minutes for anyone to clean it. Horrible customer service. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time going here. The food was just basic. You're better off going to Denny's",

Since I left Rochester I have not been able to find a breakfast restaurant that served real homefried potatoes until I ate at Griddlecakes this morning. The homefries were real potatoes and grilled on a grill just like back home in Rochester. The ham and cheese omelette I ordered was loaded with big chunks of ham and cooked to perfection. The service I received was fast and friendly the coffee was was flowing. You can tell that this is a family owned business and not part of a chain. I can't wait to return and try some other menu items and there are plenty to choose from. I will be back without a doubt probably many times.",

Why were people then seated inside and we are still not called to sit down for outside? A second waitress also just let people sit at the open outside table bc they were waiting for inside. Again...why were we not seated outside as requested?  We left bc we have a graduation to get to and they clearly dont know how to manage their seating or their customers.  Terrible service.

I said: \"wouldn't it have made more sense to say 'we're out\" instead of 'no'\"? The waitress walked away & never came back to take our order. We ended up having to flag someone down almost 25 mins later to take our order. It was the guy who originally seated us, he mentioned her name was 'Tanya' then he took our order right away. He was amazing. If I was giving 5 stars it would go to him. His service, conversation, and overall demeanor was the best! I get it, its Sunday. Its busy. But that doesn't mean you should treat your customers dismissively. When we were close to being done with the meal, we saw the waitress cleaning the table less than a foot from us, she never stopped to ask how we were doing, if we needed refills- nothing. I didn't know what to expect coming here, we were just looking for a delicious Sunday breakfast, but when we left we both stated we were not returning to this place.  Food: boyfriend ordered the birthday cake pancakes with a side of sausage. I ordered the Lumberjack with scrambled eggs. The home fries were amazing as well as the birthday cake pancakes. The food gets 4 stars.  Location: located in a shopping center that also features a farmers market, its a good location if you are in the area and want to eat after a leisurely morning of browsing/shopping. 4 stars.",

I also got a fresh squeeze orange juice - 8oz is small, totally worth it but wish it was chilled but that's a minor thing. I ordered a side of home fries which were pretty much big cubes of potatoes - it was okay but did have some uneven seasoning and most of the seasoning tasted like pepper and that was about it.

I did not come here for breakfast (which seems to inspire widely varied reviews), so I cannot comment on that, but they make a mean lunch.  I got a turkey avocado sammy on a croissant, which was simply delicious.  My dining companion opted for their Philly cheese steak and was happy with his choice.  The cheese steak was served with grilled mushrooms and onion, which he was delighted with.  The side salads were beautiful--crisp and lovely greens, all of it tasting wonderfully fresh.  Oh!  Plus, they serve a great local bottled root beer--I can't remember the brand, but my dining companion is quite the root beer aficionado and was in love with it immediately.   The service was delightful.  The prices were reasonable.  The dining area was very clean with cute, colorful, somewhat eclectic decor.  Plus, upon entrance, the kitchen can be seen quite easily (always a comforting sign).   One thing to note:  They have limited hours.  They're just a breakfast/lunch place (open until 3pm).  Can't comment on breakfast, but definitely a five star lunch!",

The pancakes were doughy and under cooked and most of the rest of the stuff resembled food from a high school fund raiser. The French toast and waffles may have been better choices.

I do recommend this place for food however CAUTION check you bill to see if it is correct.   4 out of the 5 times I have eaten there the bill was added up wrong or I was charged for food I did not receive. I do not think it was done on purpose just some people with poor math skills work here.",

It turns out to be a serious error in judgment, as this could very well be the worst breakfast that I have ever had.  I'm a fan of good corned beef hash, and I would expect that in this day and age, restaurants would be making it from scratch especially a restaurant specializing in breakfast.  This would not be the case, it came straight out of a can, and not opened today either as was apparent from the grey color. To make matters worse, even the poached eggs ordered with it were cooked hard. Oh, I forgot to mention the brunt outside, raw inside home fries and the cold toast.  We are in serious need of a great breakfast house in this area, Griddlecakes is not it.",

The skillets here are huge and tasty but arrive starving! My favorite is the philly cheese one, yum. I usually stick to the canadian bacon and eggs, simple but great every time. The boyfriend swears the biscuits and gravy are the best he's ever had, so take his word for it. The french toast is picture perfect too.  The coffee isn't quite strong enough for my taste, but that's just me.  A cool part about coming here on Sundays is the farmers market is right in the same parking lot, makes for a great morning meal then a walk around. Sometimes the wait is about 15-20 mins but even on a busy day I don't think I've waited longer than that. They offer outdoor seating as well if you want to bring your canine companion along.",

Gravy was nice and thick and very tasty. The potatoes on the other hand were bad. Tasted like boiled potatoes cut in to large chunks, then pan fried for a few seconds to reheat them. I did get a free hair from the cook right in the disgusting potatoes. That's when my meal ended. Too many good breakfast places around to waste my time with this one.",

Importantly for me, they have outdoor seating with waiter service - which means dog friendly!  My husband and I always try to order different dishes and then share. So for instance, on one of our most recent visits he ordered eggs benedict and I ordered the red velvet pancakes. You should know, the pancakes are huge!!! I ordered the short stack (2 pancakes) because I thought one wouldn't be enough for us to share - I was so wrong!! We had at least a whole pancake left over and took it home to eat it for dessert later. The red velvet pancake was definitely good - but I actually think I prefer their waffles. And although I'm not a big eggs benedict fan, I thought they were pretty good and my husband really liked them. This actually might be one of his favorite breakfast spots in town - and we'd be here a lot more often if I didn't insist that we try new places!",

Our waitress didn't even refill our waters nor did she come back to make sure we had everything.

I got the meddy wrap with the cream of tomato soup, absolutely delicious, the tomato soup was creamy it complemented the wrap well. My friend enjoyed the French toast with eggs and potatoes, she also had the orange juice on the side. The orange juice was delicious, she raved about the flavor of the orange juice plus it had a lot of pulp which made it thicker, it exactly what you would want from a freshly squeeze drink. Overall the guys in the shop were nice, good customer service. We went toward the end of lunch and as you can obviously see it slowing down for them, we weren't rushed out. I would recommend to other people. Hope to see you guys soon!",

I ordered a pancake and a side of homefries, my friend ordered a waffle combo. By this time there had been 2 or 3 tables sat down around us. It took over 20 minutes to get our food, though people and tables sat after us had all gotten their food. My potatoes were very sad, large and bland chunks that looked boiled and not crispy at all. I only ate my pancake. My friend said that her food was very good despite the wait. Our waitress was nice but the rest of the service wasn't good.

    "text": "I spent my first time here last Saturday when some friends came in from out of town. I showed up last in my party of 8, and figured we'd have to wait a while since there was 8 people in our party. Thankfully, by the time we had all said our hellos, they were ready to seat us after just a few minutes.   Having never eaten here before, and frankly, not much of a breakfast person, I decided to play it save with french toast and a side of bacon. The wait staff came through quickly and grabbed our orders, and brought us out drinks. By the time we had gotten our first round of drinks, our food started to arrive. I saw many different plates at our table since we all pretty much got something different, and as they were placed each looked better than the last.   When I finally got mine, I was presented with a full stack of over-sized french toast that looked like it belonged on pinterest or something. I seriously had to hesitate starting to eat it because it looked that good. After I finally regained my senses and picked up some silverware, I began to enjoy what is easily the best french toast I've ever had. I dug into my ginormous plate with full speed, and managed to make it halfway through the last piece before I finally had to stop myself. Somewhere in the brief pauses of the french toast, I took time to polish off the full plate of bacon which can only be described as moments of bliss.  The staff was top notch, and several members of the team came by our tables helping each other out while we were there. The drink refills came by without provocation, and out of 8 people in my group amidst a completely full restaurant, I only saw them ask what someone was drinking once. Very attentive staff with a great attention to detail. If only this place was 15 miles or so closer to my house, I'd be here at least once a week, it's that good.",

    "text": "Today my daughter took me to this cute little restaurant for breakfast. I had seen it a few weeks ago and was excited to give it a try. We got there and only had a 20 minute wait before we were seated. They too my drink order and a few minutes later took our breakfast order. The home fries looked pale and undercooked so we mentioned this to our waiter who suggested we request well done, so we did. As we waited for our meal, I heard the gentleman beside me attempting to order and the waiter, our same waiter offered him home fries or hash browns. I wasn't even aware they had hash browns. My daughter ordered Iced tea and an empty bowl to put the sugar packets trash in. We waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  As the waitress is delivering our breakfast, she also takes the trash bowl. Someone comes by and refills the tea and my daughter ask for another empty bowl. Our short stack of pancakes arrive about 10 minutes later. The waitress brought a trash bowl that still had trash in it and just sets it on the table. Now I'm no germaphobe but I have to wonder is this our original trash bowl, she took ours about 10 minutes ago, why is it wet, and isn't it restaurant policy to deliver clean dishes to a table once they've taken a dirty one? It was nauseating and I had had enough. I will not be back and I can not recommend this establishment to anyone.",

We grabbed a booth by the door and looked over the menu, which is only breakfast and lunch.  Since it was noon-ish, we picked lunch fare. A grilled chicken sandwich (plus avocado, of course) with a side salad. It was good, pretty basic, but that's what I ordered. My lunch mate ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries were delish, but the burger was super oily, so much so she couldn't eat more than a bite.  Service was good, they were friendly and pretty attentive.  Total for 2 meals, a Coke and iced tea, $27 and  change.  I might try them for breakfast one day.",

    "text": "We visited Griddlecakes for brunch and were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, and seated in an open booth.  The place was otherwise full inside and outside, so we must have timed it just right.  Our drink order was taken right away while we perused the breakfast selections and our server was back shortly to take our food order.  I decided on the Short Stack Combo for $8.98.  It included 2 hotcakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and home fries.  The hotcakes were good; fluffy and light. The bacon was very crispy, as I like it.  The eggs were standard fare.  The potatoes, well, I usually leave home fries or hash browns on my plate, but these were little cubes of deliciousness that were partially crispy and partially soft.  I really enjoyed them.   The BF ordered the Meatlovers Scramble $10.99, which was eggs scrambled with bacon, sausage, ham, homes fries, and cheese.  Served with biscuits & gravy.  The scramble was good, but the biscuit seemed stale and the gravy was pasty instead of tasty.  We would probably visit again, but it would not make the top of our brunch list.",

I had been waiting forever to have an excuse to try Griddlecakes, so when my fiance asked me where I wanted to get breakfast one morning I immediately suggested here. We went in on a Monday morning around 10:30-11 and were told we could sit anywhere. We had just sat down when someone came up to ask for our drink order...I hadn't even opened the menu yet so I was a little taken aback. I wanted to order juice or a mimosa but I was too overwhelmed so I just ordered a water. Then our waiter came back and I ordered The Arnold pancakes and my fiance ordered a three stack with blueberries with a side of bacon and two eggs. We got our food soon after and mine was really good, but he wasn't impressed with his. The blueberries were cooked into the pancakes but we both thought they would be on top of the pancakes...a little nitpicky sure. But what really got us was the side of bacon and eggs. It was definitely NOT two eggs that we were served (see picture.) I was going to complain but after we got our food we never saw our waiter again. Luckily we got to use the Yelp checkin coupon, or I would have walked away feeling cheated.   I'm willing to give you another shot Griddlecakes, but for now I am disappointed.",

The wait is long to get a table, and once we did, we sat without menus or drinks for ten minutes. When we flagged someone down to get menus, we also had to get someone else to bring utensils. The prices are stupid- plain and simple. A pancake and eggs shouldn't cost that much. Be prepared for $60+ for four people. The food also didn't come out for 20 minutes after we ordered. And we didn't order lobster, just basic breakfast. Not really blown away and most likely won't come back.",

I have ordered the same thing there each time i go trying to give it a chance since we live so close but i will not be going anymore, the last 2 times my bacon was burnt and same thing with the home fries half raw and hard hald soggy no crisp!

Everything here looked appetizing, but in this case looks were definitely deceiving.   Griddlecakes is located in a small space in a strip mall, which means your wait time can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes. Lucky enough, I only waited for about 15 minutes then was promptly seated. Before I knew it; I had three coffees in front of me: two hot, one cold, two glasses of ice water and a cup of ice. Can you say \"overly helpful\" wait staff? I'm not complaining about that, it was great that I didn't have to ask for anything because they were so on it!   The food arrived shortly after, like I said before it LOOKED amazing, I ordered the \"Philly Skillet\", this is a deconstructed philly cheese-steak sandwich minus the bread. It comes on a bed of potatoes a lot of delicious melted cheese and to add to this heaping mound of meat, cheese, and cardiac arrest, I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. This is where the meal starts to go downhill. The biscuits where ok, but the gravy was watery and pretty bland. The \"Philly Skillet\" was ok, but over-salted. Everything was cooked well, the steak was perfect, the potatoes were firm, but almost every bite had to be followed with a sip of water. I went through two glasses of water while eating this and I didn't even finish the whole thing.   My brunching buddy ordered the \"Crab Cakes Benedict\" and the \"Red Velvet\" Pancakes\"; these too were disappointing. The crab cakes had a very fishy taste, like the meat was from a can. The hollandaise sauce was good, but not good enough to save the dish. The Red Velvet Pancakes, were also a loss. These just tasted like a flat red velvet cake, very dense not fluffy like a pancake should be. They also had a raspberry sauce drizzled on top, which was peculiar. Normally you don't associate red velvet cake with raspberries.    My review for Griddlecakes is a tad tough; I was teetering between a three star review and a two star review. I decided to go with the two star review because this food was not \"A-OK\". This location is very clean and the service is impeccable. The food just fell far short of what I was expecting, over-salted and questionable flavor choices. I WILL be coming back to Griddlecakes because I believe in second chances for both people and foodies alike.",

This place is always crowded! Expand and increase your business!  I have ordered too many things to count. I typically order the veggie skillet. Their potatoes are awesome. The skillet is a good size, and it comes with either toast or biscuits and gravy. Yum! The gravy is so creamy.   I have also ordered the plain pancakes, the lemon blueberry pancakes, the red velvet pancakes, and the smores pancakes (can't remember the correct name). I have also had the waffles. My husband has had the lumberjack, the breakfast burrito, and everything I have. Ha!   I haven't had a single bad thing at this place. Their service is ok. Could pick things up a little, but it's hard to when the place is so small, so they probably cannot fit more servers. We are always greeted and brought drinks right away.   I highly recommend this place. I haven't tried any lunch, but breakfast, this is our go to spot. We like them better than Egg Works.",

We were told not to go on Sundays because it's so busy you can't get in, however, we decided to chance it anyway.  Got right in at 9:00 am and the place was mostly empty.  Service stunk! Waited 15 minutes just to get water. We ordered the highly recommended country fried steak and eggs and it was NASTY!! The potatoes tasted like the only think I can describe as moldy stale and the country gravy had zero flavor that tasted mostly like watered down hot flour!  When we brought this to the attention of the manager, she laughed!  About an hour after eating there I became seriously ill and had to go to ER, FOOD POISONING!!  Needless to say we will not go there again and we recommend you don't go there either!",

So, parking can be a pain sometimes. It's a small space, so you might have to wait if it's busy. I've been fortunate enough that I've never waited.   As for the food, it's your typical breakfast/lunch joint that serves up your typical breakfast/lunch food. Nothing special. There's your omelettes, skillets, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, etc. Nothing I've eaten here has been super OMG mind blowing. Like I said, it's very typical. Prices are on the lower end with no dish being over $15.  For the service, again nothing stellar. The servers we've encountered just looked like they were going through the motions. Not rude, but just enough friendliness to do their job. No smiles from anyone either.   Like I said, it's ok for me, but this definitely wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast.",

My eggs benedict was perfect, french toast was good and my friend said the vegetable skillet was good as well.  The pancake was cooked perfect, had a nice crisp to it and not burnt.  Thanks to Yelp we got to try a free yummy pancake !!! The food isn't extraordinary, but I would definitely come back if they stepped their game up on service.      We waited about 20 minutes outside for a table, when there were clearly tables open outside.  Then when the lady called my name she asked would you like to sit outside ?  Umm I thought first available was what that meant ... guess not.   When we sat  down we literally had to wait another 10 min before my group got irritated and actually had to go inside the store and ask for a server.  Now when the server got there, took our order he was great.  Then after that we didn't see him again.  Someone else refilled our drinks.  The food took way too long that you're starting to notice other tables seated before us received their food.  By the time we got our food they were super quick to give us the bill, which is fine.  However no one came back to us so once again we had to go inside and pay and when we did ... we got someone else's bill which was a mess.

My benny was good, sauce was on point but the egg was a little over cooked, the yolk was mostly solid inside. My friends waffles were yummy and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The free pancake had great flavor and was big and fluffy. Serving size was generous too. I guess I felt this place to be average for a couple of reasons. 1. I didn't get a water refill until I was done with all my food 2. Our server wasn't very friendly, maybe she was having an off day. It seemed like she didn't want to be there that day. 3. Parking is hard because it's in a shopping center and fills up quickly. I don't know what it was but I didn't feel like it was above average maybe it was the experience. Either way this place has good food I might come back but this time I'll order to go.",

We ordered a half portion of biscuits and gravy with sausage to start and it was really good! We also ordered an omelette and eggs and bacon. My eggs were sunny side up, I wish that restaurants would fry the egg to make it crispy! But it's ok! The bill was about $30 for both of us including drinks. It was yummy and good service!",

Today we came in a great mood ready to enjoy our day. We were sat pretty quickly greeted by a buss boy who is always nice to us, we both know how to act and how to tip. It took forever for a waiter to take our order and then another 30, yes 30 minutes with us having to ask where our food was before we got our food. We didn't order anything difficult or that needed to be cooked for a little big time. We ordered corned beef hash and eggs for me and eggs and hash browns for my husband. They struggled to get it out of the kitchen when it was served my husband did not have a fork as the table had not been properly set. I got up to get a fork for him..... This is where the smug owner came over and said can I get you anything else. No apology no hey I'm sorry no nothing, nada, zip, zilch. Then our hash browns were raw tasting hard as if they had been rushed so maybe waiter forgot to turn our ticket in, who knows no one cared to explain or apologize. We were handed a ticket at full charge which we paid but my husband did complain that our service was lousy and hard potatoes, where the very smug jerk of an owner smirked and got real smart ass about things and told us to have a nice day. Really!!! We're not people who run a waitress or who are demanding we're not lousy tippers, we're not rude, and wee were treated as though we were the jerks. We will never be back.",

We usually stop in a couple Saturday mornings a month and I enjoy a \"build your own\" omelet while my hubby indulges in French toast topped with cinnamon, strawberries & syrup.  The staff is always polite, friendly & accommodating i.e. making sure I have plenty of jalapeno's. Neither of us is very adventurous when it comes to breakfast but lots of their dishes look very tempting.   The atmosphere is comfortable and cozy but sometimes it can get a bit loud with all the happy chatter going on. They also have some outdoor seating as well to enjoy the cooler mornings.  Saturday mornings there is also a car show that takes over part of the parking lot and it's fun to walk around after indulging in a yummy breakfast.   Certainly a local's favorite!",

French toast was sprinkled w cinnamon (too much cinnamon that you couldn't enjoy the meal) AND the manager didn't offer to comp anything. Paid $30 for bad service and food.  We waited for 40 minutes before anyone realized there was anything wrong and that others were getting their orders before us.  I understand that mistakes happen and usually I am happy to wait for them to fix the mistake but they seemed non remorseful for their mistake. They really don't care to make the customer happy or that they would lose a customer. That is sad. Adios!",

I had the crab cake Benedict, my SO had the Philly cheesesteak skillet and our little one had pancakes. The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. The were fluffy and full of flavor, no syrup was needed. The steak in the skillet was seasoned perfectly. The crab cake was a little fishy, but that was to be expected. Servers were very attentive. Our glasses were never empty and the coffee was good. I asked for another cup of coffee right as we paid the bill and they offered it to me in a to-go cup, which I personally thought was very polite of them. Would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a breakfast spot in the area and we will definitely be back to try other menu items.",

I had ordered a half order of the biscuits and gravy which were par at best.  When the bill came out I was charged for a full order when I confronted the waiter he told me that was not what you told me, so instead of adjusting the he told me he would pay the difference, I'm thinking WOW management must be brutal on these kids.  Bad overall experience not sure if we will be back.",

The griddle platter was delicious along with the red velvet hot cake (yum). We didn't come during prime time, we arrived around noon which allowed us to be seated quickly. We will be returning again and will be recommending this place.",

Unfriendly staff, requested crispy bacon got burnt bacon, sent it back and got an attitude with soggy and cold bacon, of course no apology!  Had to wait for to get servers attention to get some syrup, thought their specialty is pancakes?  The only good thing is server refilled our coffee without asking. Make sure you use you free pancake with check in before you order as they won't take it off your bill.",
