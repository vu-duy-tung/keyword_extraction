The quality would bring me to come back a million times over, the lack of service could keep me away forever.",

This did not disappoint. Perfectly breaded and seasoned.  I'll definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",

The quality of the fish paired with unique creations are what makes this place surpass any other. Eddy, the owner, is behind the counter flanked by gonzo, his number 2; with two pages of specialty rolls, you will find your own new obsession. My addictions: begin with a 2 pc garlic tuna and order spicy garlic edamame but only after getting your complimentary edamame and dipping them into the cucumber salad dressing, then order a D's Guy or Kyle, and instead of dessert, finish with a Japanese Lasagna.  This IS the best sushi spot in Vegas!",

On Wednesday afternoon, my aunt, sister and I went to the restaurant , and they were closed and not serving because of an inspection. The next day (Thursday) we came back to pick up some food. The lady at the front desk told us that she was thankful that we were giving them a second chance. Today (Friday) my aunt started feeling very sick. We were questioning what she had been eating, and the only food that she ate that was different from us was her Salmon Teriyaki Entree, her sickness progressed throughout the day and we concluded that she had food poisoning. We are really sad about it but we will probably never be back. :(",

The location is easy to find and i was surprised at how large the actual inside was. I like how the tables are separated by walls so you get kind of a private intimate feeling. The decor was fun and so were the spoon pens. The staff were pleasant and clearly having a good time. the sushi chefs were clearly enjoying themselves and having fun interacting with guess who were sitting at the bar.   Food was excellent. I ordered a spider roll, a tuna cut roll, and steamed mussels and my friend ordered the yuppee roll (not sure on the spelling but it was similar to that). Everything was A+ and tasted so delicious and fresh. Definitely coming back to try more of their rolls, they have sooo many special rolls i couldnt even read through them all but some of the names and descriptions gave me a good laugh. Yay!",

You don't have to get the two rolls you have a choice of two different combinations I just chose those two because that is what I was in the mood for. You get so much food for you money and if you're not too hungry it's something you can split with someone else!   If you've only been there for dinner it's now time to try the lunch special.",

    "text": "I am a lover of sushi. But not just any sushi, I appreciate perfectly prepared, fresh fish sushi that makes me say, \"dang, that is delicious!\" Everything I ate at Spicy Tuna Sushi made me say exactly that!   We began by ordering the calamari tempura. The batter was light and delicious and the dish was served piping hot; just how I like it. Next, we ordered the Alaska Roll (soy wrapped as always). It had fresh crab, avocado, I believe some cream cheese topped with fresh salmon. It's definitely my new favorite. I enjoy simple, clean flavors.   We also decided on a second roll...I'm bummed I can't remember the full name, but it was Dr. Jason's something. I know that doesn't help much, but I did take a picture of it. : ) This one was another excellent choice! I don't know what was in it other than everything flavorful and delicious. It has a fun, large presentation too (lots of shredded tempura crispies on top). I highly recommend it!   I recently discovered how much I love mochi, so after dinner I inquired about their mochi options. They had green tea, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate and...red bean? Yup thats right, red bean. The server gave us the option to order two different flavors so we went for the traditional green tea and ventured out to try the red bean. Let me tell you the oddly sounding res bean was DELICIOUS!! It was sweet and tasted like cherries.   I am very much looking forward to visiting again to try new rolls and have some more red bean mochi!!",

We got there at 10:00 p.m. and was greeted by the host which told us that it was last call. We said fine no problem we know what we wanted. A chef then proceeds to tell us that we couldn't eat there. I don't know the chef name. I do know he was the only white chef there. Hopefully that doesn't sound racist but that's the only description I remember. My 6 yr old nephew ask me why couldn't we eat there. I told him I didn't know. I understand that the restaurant closes at 10:30 but I though they should have served us. But Thank god I love Sushi was open! The service was absolutely great and the food as well!",

A good friend of mine, Jen recommended this place so we went together. I LOVE that they bring out edamame, ginger, wasabi, and some kind of pickled something (cucumber?). We decided to order the Chihuahua Roll and D's guys. My mouth is watering just THINKING about them. Service was outstanding and the chefs were incredible. This place was so good that I made sure to come back on the last day of my trip. Definitely worth the trek off the strip if you're in town for vacation. And if you just live in vegas.. RUN, don't walk there!",

    "text": "After 15 years of loyal patronage to I Love Sushi, it seems as though the tide has turned down Eastern a bit to a newer strip mall sushi joint, Spicy Tuna. I had heard good things from friends and family, so my parents and I decided to stop in for an early dinner around 5pm last week. There were only two other tables occupied, so I knew service was going to be great BUT instead, it took about 15 minutes to get a glass of water and give someone our drink order. Yikes. The food quality however, made up for it! Quickly too, for our table was packed with sushi and appetizers in a matter of minutes.   We started with the bacon maki, wrapped in scallops which was alright, a little chewy for my taste. The Arizona roll which I thought was by far the best, fresh salmon and avocado which I garnished with thinly sliced lemon. Superb!  A HUGE portion of steaming yaki soba which was honestly the sweetest surprise of the whole meal. The flavors were so rich and sweet but not cloying and the vegetables tender and plentiful. Made for great leftovers too!   Other sushi highlights were the D's roll, which was piled high with \"cones\" of spicy tuna mixture that looked like hats or some sort of whirling dervish, and the Kyle's special which was also another little saucy number, topped with a variety of fresh fish: albacore, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp.   Filling, flavorful, and FRESH.",

We are big \"I love sushi\" fans so when I was told the owner of Spicy Tuna used to be the head chef there I was excited.   We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were seated quickly. We were given edamame and a tiny cucumber salad (about two bites). the cucumber salad was delicious, just wish it was a little bigger. The edamame were cold and not very good.  We ordered a few different pieces of sushi, a couple rolls and one specialty roll. The food came out very quickly and we were constantly checked on by several different people.  Unfortunately I was not impressed with the sushi. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, just middle of the road. It was presented nicely but nothing struck me as really good.   I gave Spicy Tuna 3 stars mostly for the great service. If it wasn't for that, it would have been 2 stars. I will stick with I love sushi in the future.",

As far as quality of fish, it's fairly standard. The cut are generous.   There is no all you can eat special, so if you're hungry, it can end up costing you.

Is there some huge corporate conglomerate in japan opening up tons of \"mom and pop\" sushi shops here in Vegas ? I don't get it.. anyways, with that off my chest....  We came for the spyonvegas open bar night. While the free sapporo was nice, the service was awful. I 100% don't blame them, however, because this place was SLAMMED. 1 thing I ordered never showed up, and another roll was pretty messed up. That beging said...  The sushi was good. They use the same krab junk that every \"sexual sushi\" place does in Vegas. The rolls were creative and had stupid names . I recommend the Joe's special... a sort of spicy tuna roll with avocado covered in garlic ponzu sauce. I like some of the items on I love sushi's menu better that I didn't find here (Screaming Orgasm anyone?), but overall they were really similar in pricing, roll variety, fish quality, etc!

The menu is virtually endless with more than 100 different rolls and then topped off with the different chef variations.  One thing I will say that with all this variety, it's difficult to get a sense of what's good and what's not since each roll, no matter if it's one that you've had before can be different each time you go.  Also, the prices are a little high with many of their rolls being over $10 and some even topping $15.  While I think their sushi is worth the price, it was still a bit of a shock the first time we went there and our meal for two was $100 including tip and no alcohol.  With all that, we'll still go back as everything seems to always be delicious and the service is way above par.",

Eddie was the sushi master at I Love Sushi for many years before transitioning to other restaurants and then establishing his own. So, the owner is on the premises and cares very much about his patrons and how they are being served.   Only peripheral complaint is the uninspired decor and the \"top 10\" equally uninspired music. Oh, the 3 flatscreens also ensure that this will never become a cozy, romantic, high end restaurant. Casual sushi still has its place though...",

I was so happy to eat such good sushi that had no rice, as I can't really eat a lot of carbs.  I ordered the Justin Special, which has fresh salmon wrapped around crab, with lots of avocado, cucumber, tomato, and some other veggie type stuff with ponzu sauce drizzled all over.  No rice!  It was frickin awesome and huge for 13 bucks.  I was full from this but I had also ordered the Danny hand roll which was chock full of yummy seafood and avocado, once again no rice.  Wonderful but hard to eat because I was so full.  Husband had a dinner special bento box which was really unique, and the chicken teriyaki was wonderful.  They had this ball of deep fried rice which was flavorful and delicious, along with goyza, salad, regular white rice and some other goodies.  Amazingly enough he loved it.  This was not a cheap dinner as we paid like 55 bucks with tip, although it was an insane amount of food.  We can't afford to eat here regularly, but we will be coming back.",

Whenever I have any clients around this area or friends in town from out of state - This is THE spot I take them for grub and now I even have people requesting we go whenever they are in town.    The bites are HUGE and the rolls are filling.(This is why a lot of fellas take dates there to get an idea of how big their mouth opens if you know what I mean!) I love spicy food!  The Kiss of Fire and NRES specials are two of my favorite.  Most days when i go in with a craving I tell Eddie or Gonzo what i want and they create some fabulous monstrous roll which I inhale with pure satisfaction EVERY time!    The service staff and the sushi chefs are all wonderful!  This place is by far the best sushi in town.  Do not  pass by this place for another joint.  This is not an \"All You Can Eat\" place and the rolls range up to $15 but most are around $11-$13 ish. You will be super full off less rolls because of the larger size of the rolls.    If you are a sake drinker...Try the Raspberry Sake - It is a cold and sweet yet sour and so very delicious sake! The chef will even do a little sake bomb with you too!   This place is very fun and casual! It is not a fancy place but the food is will one up and top any other place you have been!    Anyways...quit reading and start munching!  Geez...Now I am craving some of the rolls from Spicy Tuna! I think all of this food review is working up an appetite for me, maybe I will see you there some time!  You can try one of my special creations if you mention my name or just look on the menu! Enjoy! Arigato!",

    "text": "All-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi is definitely popular with many people. While AYCE sushi is the most cost effective method of enjoying the most amount of sushi for as small a cost as possible, I think the beauty of the sushi is lost. When you're stuffing your face with a new sushi dish every 5 mins, you don't really appreciate it as much as if you were ordering sushi a la carte. This place does not offer AYCE sushi, so this is a great place to really savor the sushi and think about all the different ingredients that are in your mouth as you are chomping on that piece of sushi.  I ordered the Crunchbug Special (with additional cream cheese), served alongside a bowl of Orgasm Sauce. Wow, what a name. the cost of the dish is $13.25. The \"crunchbug\" is a double decker sushi with the ends being made of tempura shrimp. The star of this dish though, is indeed that orgasm sauce. Let's just say it lives up to that name. It is a rich creamy sauce with herbs and a nice spicy kick added to it. Why is this sauce so special? Because you take the sushi and you completely dunk it in this orgasm sauce. And let me tell you, when you eat a \"dunked sushi\", it is a million times better. It's just like those Chicago style Italian beef sandwiches where they're dipped in the juices of the beef. It just takes the sushi to the next level. You'll wonder why more sushi isn't dunked after you've tried it. And since it's not AYCE sushi, you'll really appreciate the explosion of flavor.  I sat at the bar and the sushi chefs are very friendly. A football game was being shown on a nearby TV and the chefs were chatting up the football games with us. Service was speedy too, which is always a plus. Overall, a great place to have sushi when you're tired of all the AYCE sushi found practically everywhere else.",

Their menu is fun and they have almost 100 different rolls and I enjoy reading through each and every one to pick something out!! Hubby and I tried the Jalapeno Lover which are jalapenos stuffed with spicy salmon and cream cheese, then deep fried - they're like jalapeno poppers. Good but probably wouldn't get it again. Also got the Japanese Lasagna which was tasty but have had better elsewhere. The last roll we tried was our favorite; #61 Love Long Time. The roll had shrimp tempura, cucumbers, cream cheese, and salmon, all tossed with avocado, tomatoes, onions and jalapenos. It had all the right textures! We also tried the Bulgoki which was ok. It didn't have a very authentic taste. All in all it was good and if I could give 3 1/2 stars I would but I'm giving them 3 stars because it didn't blow my mind and I'm not sure if I would go there again.",

The D guy roll was equally as good (I liked that one best) with lots of flavors. I also liked how they started us with edamame.

We also ordered 2 pieces of fresh water eel, and the 1st time they came out, it was completely burnt and charred. I had to return them and get them to make us a new order. We also ordered gyoza $5.25 and those had really thick skin and overly fried, no flavor at all. We ordered several rolls to share as well, and all 3 were very pricey and mediocre in taste.   The service was decent, but I had to call for service, no one actively came and asked us how we were doing.   We spent over $100 before tax and tips between the 2 of us, and we could have gotten a better meal at an AYCE place. Not a fan!",

We ordered:  - Bottle of Star Rabbit sparkling sake - 1 Order of Salmon sashimi - 1 Order of Tuna sashimi - 1 D's Guy roll - 1 Tijuana roll  To start, they bring edamame and a small cucumber salad. To be honest, I could've done without this. The edamame was overcooked and the cucumber salad only had 4 thinly sliced cucumbers. It was a little sad.   The sashimi however, was super fresh! Salmon was incredible. Tuna was good, but I just preferred the salmon.  Both the D's Guy roll and Tijuana roll were amazing. Incredibly flavorful, perfect amount of sauce, nice different textures, and beautifully presented.   The best part of our dining experience was the host. He was hilarious. He kept us entertained, told jokes, and kept checking on us throughout our meal.",

Almost all sushi places have something called spicy tuna on the menu and it is usually the little bits of tuna that are left over from cutting sashimi all chopped up and mixed with mayo and Sriracha and rolled into a maki. Not my favorite dish. As it turned out, this place had so much more than that to offer, including amazing sushi and beautiful presentation  I went here with my sister and her family while visiting a few weeks ago and we had a delicious dinner. My brother in law is a chronic over-orderer so that meant I got to try a lot of different dishes. Unfortunately don't remember all the names now but I did post pictures. I do remember that I really liked every single one of them. All the fish was fresh which is my primary gauge for a sushi restaurant. And the sauces and other accompaniments on each plate were only there to enhance the flavor of the fish. Everything was visually appealing as well. The service was friendly but not intrusive. Overall it was a great meal and I am sure we will be back.",

I ordered the Crab Salad- Sliced cucumber crab meat, kaiware, furikake, in house dressing. It says \"crab meat\" on the menu.  Imitation crab is made with a type of fish called surimi. Manufacturers add fillers, flavoring and color to surimi to mimic the taste, texture and color of real crab legs. Imitation crab meat is a versatile ingredient that costs far less than the real thing. These imitation crab sticks are high in sodium and the nutritional value is not as good as real crab meat. Just be honest with ingredients.",

    "text": "This is a pretty solid non-AYCE joint in Henderson/Anthem area. My husband and I were in the area and I have had this place bookmarked forever, plus it was recently recommended by Matt S, so deciding where to have early dinner was no brainer.  We started with a couple of (underwhelming) appetizers: Calamari Tempura and Bacon Maki. I was not impressed with either selection and let my husband finish both. The calamari was 90% scrape-the-roof-of-your-mouth-raw tempura with a small chewy bit of octopus. Bacon Maki was scallop wrapped in bacon - I mean I am a fan of anything wrapped in bacon, but this combo didn't work for me. The bacon tasted rubbery, old and microwaved.   We ordered salmon nigiri and scallop nigiri and both were fantastic. The cuts of fish were quite large on a tiny bed of rice, and most importantly, they were fresh.  We ordered 3 rolls of sushi as I typically like to balance out my rolls. I generally opt for a havier baked roll, a spicy roll, and a very simple and fresh roll. We went with:  Sun Devil Roll Smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, ebi, spicy crab, sliced jalapeno, served w/ yum yum  (4/5)  Rainbow Roll Fresh tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, halibut on top of california roll (5/5)  Kiss of Fire W/ Extra Spicy Sauce Shrimp tempura, spicy soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, albacore (4/5)  We topped it off with two orders of mochi.  The total pre tip was ~$70 and based on the portion and quality of the fish, it was well worth the money.   The interior is spacious and clean, and appears to have the neighborhood appeal judging by some of the regulars that were there. The service was friendly and accomodating.  I would both recommend this place to others and come back myself.",

I'm glad to see service isn't bad all the time. Also, they were really fast with my order. It was super simple, but still! They have lunch specials, which I would recommend because if you like to order a little bit of everything, it can add up!  I gave Spicy Tuna 3 stars because the sushi prices are kind of expensive and the service was so bad the first time. This is a great location, right next to Trader Joe's, so I'm sure I will stop in again. If so, I will update my review based on that experience too.

Spicy Tuna has a few unique sushi rolls when compared to 'I Love Sushi', like D's Guy Roll, Gonzo 2, and the Ting.

Very open area which is nice and clean. Restrooms and everything is well upkept.  Price: Uni sashimi is 7.95, sushi for 6.95. Great price since it is the same quality or maybe even better than Nobu.   Final comments: Would come every week with girlfriend to get our Uni fix! De-fucking-licious.",

The spicy, garlic edammame is by far the best in town as is their green tea. We are still trying to figure out our favorite rolls though. We love Burning night Screaming O, Kyle's roll and their Screaming O. We have pretty much gone through the entire menu now and honestly, you can't go wrong. The only knock is that the fish is ice cold when served, not a bad thing since you know they are keeping it on ice, its just a little off putting when you bite into a roll.  Everyone should be trying out this spot, you will catch us their Friday nights!",

This is a great place for weekday lunches with plenty of private booths for business.   The food is soooooo good! My favorite dish is the Grand Canyon roll. I'd never had anything like it before! A California roll smothered in onion sauce loaded with mushrooms, shrimp and scallops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! The have a small but delicious Sake selection which the staff is well versed in and can recommend the best for your tastes. They are very accommodating to special diets as my boyfriend is diabetic and they can use cucumber instead of rice for your rolls.  Other than the delicious food and great service you will definitely remember their playlist. This is the only sushi place that plays r&b and top 40 music with videos or the game on the screens. It's pretty awesome!",

I'm not a fan of sushi, or any fish for that matter, but I've been to sushi places with friends. I've got to say that the sushi rolls at Spicy Tuna were pieces of art, very appealing to sushi lovers and pretty big in size. I would highly recommend this place for anyone. Plenty of options for sushi and non-sushi eaters",

Great menu variety and really top quality.  The ambiance and the staff are also great.  It's a nice place to go either with a group or just alone when I get out of work late and don't want to cook.  I've never asked them to customize anything because there are lots of items on the menu that I still want to try.  But they are always friendly and accommodating, and I think that type of thing would be fine.  Most of the items have cucumber, which I don't like, so I think on an upcoming visit I'll run out of other things and will need to do that.",

    "text": "On christmas eve, we decided to get sushi nearby, and we are so happy we decided on this place.   The staff is very kind and patient. They even gave us recommendations (special roll 15 kept them in business apparently).  I ordered the justin special (im annoying, i know), but it is such a fresh dish. The sushi is wrapped around the roll, put in with a nice liquid spicy/tangy sauce that i couldn't get enough of. I also got a bite of special 15, and it was bomb. The fried ball on top of the sushi roll was perfect.   Parking is easy and great as well.   Cant wait to come back!",

    "text": "Hands down the BEST sushi ever. Their staff is amazing too.   Here's a little secret, if you don't feel like going to the restaurant and you'd rather lounge around in pajamas, order it to go (or through Postmates). The food is ALWAYS fresh, hot (if it comes hot) and delicious. We've ordered it through delivery 3 or 4 times and it's always perfect. We even order the D's Guys roll and it still comes delivered to our house as if we were sitting at their table. Nothing is messy or smashed together. Presentation is still perfect. It's amazing!!   All of their food on their menu is good though. I love their Miso soup, teriyaki chicken, all of their crunch rolls and their house dressing. You seriously have to try it! You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "This is a good sushi option in Henderson, not my first choice for non AYCE, it's probably third or fourth, but a good place to go if you're looking for rolls. Eddie, the owner, is also another reason to come. He's engaging, friendly, and attentive. I'll usually come in for lunch and sit at the bar directly in front of Eddie.  While you're looking over the very roll-centric menu, you can snack on the complimentary edamame and cucumber salad. There's also a full menu of hot dishes, but there is no separate menu or listing of nigiri. If you like ponzu like me, there is a good number of rolls designated on the menu that sit in a pool of the tangy G-ponzu sauce. Overall, many of the rolls are kind of redundant with the same ingredients, especially fish, on the inside with variations of sauces on the outside.  There's also a section of the menu dedicated to sashimi dishes. The halibut jalapeno is my favorite and definitely recommended if you like halibut and spice. When you're finished, you'll get a small serving of freshly sliced oranges to cleanse the palate.   There's plenty of seating in the restaurant and you usually won't have to wait for a table. The two servers on the floor are experienced and will do well to take care of your needs. A couple of rolls will set you back an AYCE price, so those looking to fill up or if you're more of a nigiri fan, this place might not be for you. If you're a roll fan, Spicy Tuna has plenty of selection and variety to make you happy.",

    "text": "The sushi was delicious and for that I would come back.  However, the service was less than one star and desirable.  We have a ten minute wait with open tables while the boy at the front worries about packing a to go order.  We were then directed to our table by the boy pointing and saying you can sit there at half way across the room.  We sat down and the experience proceeded in which we had to ask for napkins, ask for soy sauce, ask for wasabi and ask for refills on our drinks.  The waitress at one point took two of the glasses when we asked for water and tea with a refill of ice as well and placed them down on the sushi bar leaving them for five minutes while she ran sushi to another table.  In the meantime a nice young efficient man ask my other daughter is she wanted a refill on her water and he returned back with her drink before the young lady returned with the other two.  In this day in age customer service is just as important as the quality of food.  So in conclusion, fantastic food but horrible customer service.",

    "text": "So we were tricked into eating here. Haha! After shopping in Trader Joe's we passed by this place and was reading the menu outside. As we were reading the menu a gentlemen walked in to the place and said this place has great food. Went in to give it a chance and what did we see? The gentlemen who told us that it has great food, is actually the server. Oh boy! Gave it a try anyway and ordered sushi and some salad and soft shell crab. Deep fried green tea ice cream. Out of all the things we ordered, the soft shell crab was the best. Crunchy and tasted very good. The sushi was also acceptable. Place is very open and has an relax atmosphere. It was kinda slow when we got in which that is how I like it when we eat out. Not too loud and crazy busy. We weren't feeling rushed and service was great. They got a sushi bar where u can sit and watch some sports or news. Now for the green tea deep fried ice cream, this is the reason y I gave it a 3 Star. This by far has been one of the most bland ice cream I've had. It tasted like the ice cream was freezer burned and did not have flavor at all. The batter wasn't crispy at all and there was too much of it. Wouldn't come here for dessert, but for sushi and Japanese food? Sure I'll come around again. Maybe we will sit by the sushi bar this time and just get the sushi and soft shell crab.",

The dining room is very large with plenty of bar seating.  I was disappointed that they didn't offer any lunch specials with so many other places that do.  Oh well... I wasn't going to leave.    We tried a few different plates.  The Japanese Lasagna roll was good.  Crab and cream cheese baked with cheese on top.  That was right up my alley.  The Gonzo 2 roll was presented beautifully.  This roll had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spicy crab, cucumber, seared albacore and crispy onion.  With all of those wonderful ingredients it fell short.  Yeah... I was surprised too! Plus it's just too hard to eat.  Most of the inside fell out just trying to pick up one piece.    Oh well.  It was worth a shot.",

We were amazed of the quality of the food. It was simply amazing. Spicy Tuna , is by far the best Sushi we have ever had!

Sometimes I just want a simple roll that has amazing tasting seafood in it, not amazing sauce. Maybe thats just me though.  Anyway, the pictures already posted here are a good representation of type of sushi rolls that that are made here.   By the way they have brown rice available upon request.    I didn't have any problem with the service. I sat at the sushi bar and the  sushi chefs were friendly and prompt.",

The place is nice it has semi private booths some tables and the traditional sushi bar, the service is great, the waiters check on you constantly to make sure you don't miss anything, the food?.... well it was kind of pornographic....we ordered the who's your daddy, taste like my x-girlfriend, screaming orgasm and the happy ending. Don't ask me why, since they also have all kinds of normal sushi rolls like princes Deana with orgasm sauce, sex on the beach, the Tijuana express and the Mexican roll, but they just sounded too familiar, like I had them before. Prices are reasonable, you would pay way more for all that at a massage parlor and not leave as happy, so next time you're in the neighborhood make sure to give them a try, you'll be an instant fan....but then who isn't a fan of a good happy ending?...........roll.",

The fish was fresh, quickly, and with a visit from one of the sushi chefs.  The decor was casual but classy. We ate here with our children which was fine because it was still early in the evening. The girls enjoyed udon with tempura and spicy ramen (which they adjusted to suit her taste).   There are quite a few tables, individual semi-private \"rooms\" (tables separated by walls), and a sushi bar and about three televisions playing basketball.  One of the rolls we did indulge in was the Grand Canyon (since we had just come from there). It was sauteed scallops, shrimp, mushrooms, and onions over California roll. Delish! (My son did think it would have been cool to create an \"Arizona Roll\" and then top it with the sauteed mixture!)  We don't live here, however, we'd recommend this place to others. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast. We paid just about $100 for 3 rolls, 2 orders of uni, 2 orders of hamachi sashimi, hamachi collars, udon, and ramen. Pretty reasonable.",

Umm, Why even offer that as an option if you are gonna be so stingy-maybe if I were a dog and ate bones I would've felt satisfied but I'm not. Even if I were given 2 small pieces with the short rib intact (meat & bones) I would be more happy understanding that with a lunch special you will get a smaller portion but c'mon.... So I did think the food was tasty, the short rib fatty pieces/bones tasted good(too bad I had no meat to eat), tempura good, loved the salad dressing and the OG Roll good but not great (could've been more hot). OG Special- Spicy Salmon, Avocado, Yum Yum Sauce & Scallions Topped with Tabasco I would go back and be willing to try other items, items without bones that is!!!!",

    "text": "A group of us decided to try Spicy Tuna on a recent Saturday evening due to the great Yelp reviews. We had 6.5 people in our group (4 adults, two kids, one baby), it seemed like they were unprepared for a group of more then 4...  we were seated at two tables that were pushed together and it still felt like we needed more room...   The complimentary edamame and cucumber salads that were brought out were a nice gesture, I would have appreciated water coming out first though. We made up for it by doing sake bombs, which made a bit of a mess (please get some smaller glasses, Spicy Tuna management!!)  As others have stated, this is more of a roll place... I still love well made rolls. The menu was a little intimidating, they have 86 'specialty rolls' listed so it took us a while to decide.  We finally agreed to start with:   Large Screaming Orgasm - Generous portion of seared tuna but I've had better orgasm sauces.   Sun Devil Roll   - I don't do jalapenos usually but  this roll had the perfect amount to give it some kick without it being too overpowering. Yumyum sauce was fantastic. Probably my favorite roll of the night.   Caterpillar roll  - Came with shrimp tempura, would have liked for it to have more eel.   Philly Roll - Hard to mess up this classic.   I Love Sushi Roll - Spicy tuna with more tuna on top. Not bad, not amazing.   We also ordered one plate of teriyaki chicken for the kids as well as some sodas. Total damage with tax and before tip - $130. Overall, I was happy with my meal but wasn't blown away, especially for the price paid.",

    "text": "So the service is a little questionable at first. Upon sitting down, we got cucumber and edamame and the sushi menu. Then one of the members of the group orders one beer. When the beer arrived, we figured they'd just give us water but we were wrong. We eventually got water.  So as we're going through the menu while looking through all the delicious yelp photos, I ask our initial server if this was the only menu, and she said no and brought us the sushi ordering paper... ? So at that point, we're a little disappointed, but we find a few rolls and sashimi that we'd like to order.  Then I ask another server, Mimi, if we could order, and she completely changed our night and made it better. Before reluctantly ordering just sushi, we asked her if they sold entrees to which she grabbed the other menu. At this point, everyone was super excited because we just wanted to order entrees for the group and share a few sushi rolls.  For the table, we ordered a few sashimi, anaebi (bomb), gyoza, shishito pepper, 2 entree combo, a 3 entree combo, 2 sushi rolls and I'm sure a lot more that we ordered.   I am sad I didn't get to take any pictures. Nor get a better description of the food, but just know everything was amazing. Try it all! Devour everything! Yum :)",

When we pulled up, the sign said \"closed\" and we were like... uhhhhhh. I was like, they have to be open! We checked Yelp and it said they were open. We walked up and \"nose go-ed\" it and I lost. So here I am going to open the door hoping they're not closed. And lo and behold they were open... with lots of people in there. Okay, maybe not so funny. Just thank you Yelp for posting the correct hours. I think they forgot to turn their closed sign off. Haha.  Anywayyyyy.  The ambiance of the place is really nice.  It's super clean. Big open space. They can fit large parties.   Upon being seated, they brought us complimentary cucumber salad and edamame (yums!). Our drink orders were taken quickly and we had needed some time to check out the wonderfully long list of different sushi rolls. I am in love with anything with lemon so we got the Ashley Roll. We also got the Spicy Shrimp Roll. Prices weren't too bad for what we got and it was actually quite filling for the two of us!  I would definitely recommend this place for their rolls and am excited to come back to try something new!  Tip: ask for ponzu sauce and dip your sushi in it... extra delicious flavor for your mouth.",

Plenty of seating at the bar, intimate table seating throughout.   Some friends were recently talking about it, which is what reminded me. I was craving sushi the other night and decided to go to Spicy Tuna Sushi for dinner. This was a Saturday night, not too busy at the time I visited.   Everything about Spicy Tuna Sushi was great. Friendly welcome when you walk in and took a seat at the bar. The chefs were friendly, offered suggestions and I had some of the best rolls in a long time.  Overall just a really great place for sushi. If you are looking for a place in this area, try it!",

Their specialty sushi roll menu was extensive....maybe like close to 90 something rolls to choose from. Kinda overwhelmed by that haha.  We ordered: -spicy tuna roll -Andrew Roll-soft shell crab, spicy tuna, crab, cucumber, super white tuna, mustard sauce -Double D-shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, spicy salmon with avocado on top.   These are pretty good sized rolls too so between the two of us, sharing three orders got us pretty full. Specialty rolls can range from $8-14. Definitely will be back. There were soooooo many other rolls we would like to try.",

    "text": "We told each other (2 friends and I) that we weren't going to stuff our faces and obviously we were lying to ourselves. Spicy Tuna does not offer AYCE but they offer a great selection of rolls and for whatever reason, they also have GIGANTIC rolls. I'm not complaining, I was just amazed at how humongous the rolls we got were. One piece of the roll could not fit my mouth even though I tried multiple times. It doesn't hurt that the staff is very friendly and hilarious signage is posted (see my posted photos).  So here's what we ate... Complimentary appetizer: I love that they give edamame and cucumber salad without even asking. That's very sweet of Spicy Tuna and made me feel all warm inside, not literally though.  Appetizer: When we got the small screaming o salad, I was in awe of the portion. It was enough for 4 or 5 people as an appetizer. We also got the garlic edamame and it was delectable and highly addicting.  Rolls: My friend ordered the Amazing David that is no longer on the menu. The name is so intriguing and mysterious, no? We also ordered the Kiss of Fire and the Gonzo. All of them were huge and hugely yummy and I wanted to devour every single piece of sushi. The nice thing about a la carte is that you bring all the leftover food home.  Oh wait... we didn't stop there. We also got the tempura green tea ice cream. It did not disappoint in all its deep fried, green and creamy goodness.  I honestly can't wait to come back here! They know how to do a customer right.",

They have my favorite sushi roll in the city (D's Guy Roll)  3. There are many kinds of sushi joints from high end to low end crap. This place is quality fish, put together in fun original rolls with a focus on quality and value.   If you are look my for a local neighborhood owner operated gem check this place out. I drove from downtown to Henderson just for this place monthly.   That's the D's Guy Roll In the background.

Sushi roll was good (my wife and I go with the cucumber rolls w/ avocado). This is a good option for those who really don't like seafood all that much.  Negatives:  1. The salad which is part of the 2-item dinner special had way too much dressing on it.  2. The bulgoki beef was disappointing. The flavor was ok, but the beef itself was a little soggy and fatty.  From my experience, there are better sushi places in the area. I love Sushi, and Momo sushi come to mind.",

Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere. He is ALWAYS there which is awesome cause that means you can go anyday you want at any time and you will have the best sushi chef there to create the most amazing fish you have ever had.  The rolls are inventive and delicious. Eddie needs to sign up for a \"how fast can you make sushi contest\" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you!   I feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!  This place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \"yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro!   If you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go! Just make sure you dont already have dinner plans for the night after, cause i guarentee you that you will want to go back again!!   Thank you Eddie, for bring to Henderson the best sushi EVER!! You are the MAN!!!!   oh, and after writting this and thinking about it, im sure ill see you in a few hours.. lol   (pictures posted)",

I love that there's daily specials although don't fall in love with any of them, as they tend to not remember how to make old specials. TVs around the bar make it convenient to catch a game and food at the same time.  The bar is the fastest way to get your food and service. Table is fine but they seems to have a team effort on attending tables. Sometimes I get refills/service when needed, sometimes I feel no ownership. Wouldn't recommend take out unless you call ahead. My last take out took over 25 minutes and the place wasn't that busy.  It's the rolls that keep me coming back. Try Ds guy, mike special, crunch bug, and Kelly D!!",

The sushi was excellent, and the dinner specials were such a value considering the enormous amount of food you get.

The balance is sometimes lost when ones artistic flare takes over, but Spicy Tuna has found that beautiful balance and made hundreds of delicious rolls.   If you come, pace yourself! The rolls are generous and well worth the price. Have tea or water not beer! You'll blow up too fast. Lol. Trust them and enjoy the feast that is presented before you.",

I knew going in that this a \"crazy rolls\" place which I've decided to rebrand as what I call \"cartoon sushi\" meaning, made by non-Japanese people, resembling nothing close to what authentic sushi looks like, and drowned in sauce so you can't tell what you are eating or wether it's fresh or not.   Food: two rolls - D's guy special and Kyle special, recommend by the waitress. Rolls were large and difficult to get in the mouth and I have a big mouth. LOL. D's guy didn't even look like sushi - it looked like a mound of breadcrumbs on top of a sideways roll.   The menu and the names are similar to I Love Sushi; not sure if they are related.   Service: we had two different waitresses. The second could not make any recommendations of what she herself enjoyed eating there. I think English was a barrier for her.   Ambiance: only about 1/4 full at lunch on a Friday.   Location: next to Trader Joe's.   Won't be back!",

It requires the chef's skills to inspect and select freshest sea food possible, and of course the expertise of the cutting and style of presentation. Spicy Tuna Sushi offers the best quality of Sashimi at the cost of a fraction of the expensive shop in town. So long the Spicy Tuna keeps up with their quality of fish, I will be his loyal customer. The ambiance can improve a bit, it is too dark and it deserves an upgrade.",

I've been here a handful of times and it is a reminder of how crazy it is that I can eat so much at an AYCE but can probably only do like a roll an appetizer here hah!  They have really creative rolls and their wait staff is is pretty on it.  When it comes to their sushi rolls and nigiri I feel like they use better quality fish and seafood than most places.   I also don't think you're getting better quality seafood than other Japanese restaurants like an izakaya in town (Kyara, Ichiza, Hachi, Izakaya Go).  They are a good lunch option that have a $10 bento style option. They also have dinner combos for like $13-$15 bucks. These Bento options have some tasty options like grilled salmon, chicken Katsu, and teriyaki chicken.   I do have to agree with a lot of people who say they don't feel like they use the freshest ingredients. They gave me a complimentary edamame when I got seated recently and honestly could have done without.  It can definitely get pricey here.  I don't see the value here and since the business of the restaurant isn't so high I feel like their food quality isn't as high. I'd recommend going to an AYCE place and seeing if they have a lunch option or serve bento style lunches and dinner (Kaizen is in the area) instead of a non-AYCE option and they will have higher quality and fresher food being served.",

The sushi itself was okay, nothing really fancy, no special presentation, it was very fresh though which is a big plus. They had the playoff game on which for us was a big plus as we love basketball. The only bad thing was the service was a bit spotty, not really rude but not great either. Our original waitress left and never came back to check on us, another lady ended up taking our second sushi roll order. And a gentleman who I believe was the manager seemed to say hello to everyone except for us, to the point he knew people's family members and remembered their previous orders but never so much as said hello to me and my son. We may be back if we are in that area, may not, just not so sure yet.",

We arrived on Sunday night, only an hour before closing (Closes at 10pm). We (3 of us) sat at the sushi bar. We were not given a nigiri menu, but my husband verbally ordered some from the sushi chef. We were given a bowl of edamame. There were no condiments on the counter, nor were we given silverware or napkins. We had to ask for everything, even soy. That being said, the Justin was extraordinary! We also ordered the D's Guy Special and it was equally extraordinary! The quality and portions of the fish are excellent. One thing-they do not have an all-you-can-eat program, so it can get a little pricey. But if you are looking for a sushi experience, this is the place. Super fresh fish, clean environment. I'm guessing of service was because they were closing in an hour and it was Sunday? Only one other patron in the place. We WILL go back another time.",

    "text": "5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars! I wish I can give this place a MILLION stars!  If you're new, get the D's Guy Roll. It's SOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDDDDD!!! Honestly, I've been coming to Spicy Tuna here OVER 100 TIMES within the past 6 years. The quality of the fish is OUTSTANDING and INCREDIBLE. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  We've tried just about EVERYTHING on the menu and we have narrowed down some of the best things to get at Spicy Tuna. By the way, all of their sushi rolls are stacked and FULL OF FLAVOR and 1 roll will usually fill you up completely. Plus, their Nigiri (fish on top of rice) is UNBELIEVABLY FRESH. In addition, all of Eddie's sushi rolls have really fun names...  (#15) D's Guy Special: MOUTHWATERING, yet tart with a hint of spicy sriracha! Mmm.....! I usually eat the top of the roll and dip both sides of the rice and tuna into that SIGNATURE sauce. FYI, this is Eddie's personal creation and is a staple to our regular sushi CRAVINGS.   (#30) Jackpot Special: Sweet, DELIGHTFUL, moist, and yummy. This is another great sushi roll that is stuffed with shrimp tempura and loaded with crab meat, all of which is DRIZZLED in yum yum CREAMY sauce and that SWEET eel sauce. And dusted with crisp bread crumbs. Trust me, eel sauce is like a sweet barbecue taste that cannot be separated. You'll want to mix it in with the crunchy crumbs. Omg... So freaking DELICIOUS.  (#21) Dr. Jason Special: Savory, crunchy, and mildly spicy. This is the brother to the Jackpot Special. It's similar in a way to how it looks, but it has it's own UNIQUE blends of flavors. It's GREAT and it's a perfect ALTERNATE if you come often.  (#72) Paul and Veronica: Deep Fried, crispy, savory, and creamy. This is another great alternative if you are bored of raw sushi. This is totally cooked throughout and is awesome for those that can't seem to like sushi. It's AWESOME.  (#63) The Hulk: Super Sweet, tangy, and fun. If you really run out of choices, give this a shot. It's AMAZING how Eddie can make sushi taste.   (#10) Birthday Special: ;) Obviously get it for the birthday guy or girl. It's a birthday SURPRISE!   WHOA NEW ROLLS!?  THE RAIDER SPECIAL: SPICY! Watch out for those jalapenos! The black rice is a SUPER COOL way to make sushi even more aesthetically appealing.  THE GOLDEN KNIGHT SPECIAL: I'll let you tell me just how good it was. It's definitely a crowd-pleaser!  P.S. We are planning on hiring them as a wedding cater for Sushi Appetizers! That's how AMAZING they are and they have a very soft spot in our friends and family's hearts. WE LOVE YOU EDDIE!!",

    "text": "Today a group of us came by to have some well needed friend time and enjoy what else?  Some great sushi!  When you walk into this place, you are greeted by the hostess station on the left and a huge sushi bar area, front and center.  I could tell this place really focuses on the sushi bar style which is dramatic and eye catching!  On the sides, you literally have intimate cubbie sections for you and a date or a nice quiet family dinner.  There are TVs in the place that plays various Asian shows.  I really enjoyed the decor.  Dramatic stained glass lighting, Japanese lanterns, cloth paneling with Asian inspired pictures and Kanji galore!  This place definitely gets a 5 star in my book for the decor :)  For my meal, I got a great deal!  Their lunch special is only $8.95 and offers A LOT of food!  On my plate, I started with a bowl of their miso soup.  Filled with seaweed and tofu, this miso was delish!  As an added bonus, the table got a couple of cups filled with lightly salty edamame.  Makes me feel healthy!  On the lunch special, you can choose 2 items from a list of about 20!!  I chose the chicken katsu and grilled makarel.  The chicken katsu was AH-MAZE-ING!!  White meat lightly breaded and deep fried.  Their katsu sauce was more on the savory-tangy side and sooo my type!  The grilled makarel was nicely charred and super flaky.  YUM!!  Garnished with a couple of slices of lemon.  Both were served over a bed of shredded cabbage.  On top of all that, this special is served with white rice, seasoned with furikake, or seaweed rice seasoning with sesame seeds.  People, we're not done yet!  This dish also comes with a salad thats topped with a mustard based dressing.  Usually when I go to sushi joints, I expect a salad with a vinegar-ginger based dressing as it's everywhere, so I REALLY appreciated a change.  Lastly, this special came with a couple of fried gyoza stuffed with pork and half of an egg roll.  The entire special was finished with a wedge of orange.  WOW, what a steal!  I was in lunch special heaven.  Everything was so good and just the right amount.   Our table also got other things like the garlic edamame.  I loved the garlic flavor and the hint of spiciness.  Really knocked it out of the park in the game of edamame!  Man, oh man!  For the value of a lunch meal, how can you go wrong?!  This place rocked!  Great company, great food, great atmosphere.  Definitely coming back, I will!  Oh, and you should too!!!",

After driving 20 minutes to pick up my order and another 20 minutes driving home I find that they forgot the screaming o sauce. So I called them and tell them that they forgot the sauce, and they said they'll be willing to give us a discount the next time we go in. My husband was really upset because what is the screaming o without the screaming o sauce? But I was fine and told him its sashimi so we can eat it with soy sauce and itll be good, right? No.. we tried eating a couple pieces with soy sauce and it did not taste good at all. We just couldn't eat it, so I called back asking if they could give us a refund for the screaming o instead of the discount for next time. We'd be willing to drive all the way back and bring the fish because it's such a waste of $16 when we only ate a couple pieces of it. But they said they won't be able to do that and the best they can do is give us a 10% discount for next time. Seriously??? 10% is the best they can do?? We waste $16 today and they want us to come back again to spend another $16 just to get $1.60 discount. Really? That is just ridiculous. I work at a restaurant and it's really not that hard to void a payment. Or if this restaurant really doesn't know how to void payments, they could always give the refund back in cash. What's more upsetting is that I left them tip, and I never used to leave tip unless I was eating in. Seriously though... that's the best they can do..?",

I was so glad...I ordered edamame (generous portion), 2 avacado cucumber rolls, a 2 item dinner special with bulgoki, and a side of rice. Oh yeah, my hubby had a coke.  We ended up with a 35.00 bill. Not bad! Affordable and quality food. The only thing I would change about my experience is asking them to not be so liberal with the dressing for the salad. Its very good but its strong. Also, the bulgoki was slightly like a stew which I've never seen before. Even still, it was hella good. Yay Spicy Tuna!",

Ended up ordering the beef teriyaki dinner special w tempura shrimp and vegetable. The tempura fell very short, no crunch, no crisp. More like it was made in the microwave, limp. Teriyaki was ok but way to much sauce. Food was ok but there was probably a reason why there was only 2 other parties in the restaurant at the time. Friends were not impressed. Next time we think the hour wait would be better worth it at our fave place.",

Aside from the \"creative\" menu item names the food is top notch. Not a traditional take on sushi but definitely one that does it right. The staff provides friendly service and makes you feel welcomed.  The sushi bar has mounted TVs to satiate all the sports fans desires. The booths surrounding the bar provide quieter a option for dates and conversation.  If you are in the area give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

Unique rolls a plenty, the chefs try combinations we never heard of, they do quite a bit of frying & rely heavily on green onions...so be aware of that.",

The sushi is remarkable, it's fresh and has wonderful flavor and textures. I love D's Guy, Katie Lo, Danny Hand Roll and Johnny Roll.  The D's Guy mix of soft shell crab on top of the rice and tuna is great. Katie Lo has mix of fish and cream cheese. I never liked cream cheese in my sushi, but Katie Lo makes me believe it's the best ever invented. I'm not a huge fan of seaweed, so the Danny hand roll wrapped in soy paper is fabulous and inside is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and soft shell crab :) the Johnny roll is perfect for those looking for low carb and not fond of raw fish. It's crab mix with shrimp tempura wrapped in cucumber, deliciously refreshing. As many times as I try new sushi places, Spicy Tuna always wins.",

You absolutely can not find better quality sushi in all of Las Vegas/Henderson. Eddie, the owner and head chef is always there and he is also the same chef responsible for creating the menus for Encore's sushi restaurant as well. His sauces are sensational and creations are unmatched. The atmosphere at Spicy Tuna is not quite as nice as I Love Sushi though. Spicy is more like a sports bar type feel Bright, TV screens with sports playing, kind of cheesy decor. You just don't get that same cozy dining feel that you may hope for on a Friday or Saturday night with your girl. I really wish Eddie would change the style of the place but you still cant match the fish quality and when your looking for good sushi that really is all that matters. I give this place my highest rating still! Favorite dishes are Sex on the Beach (Garlic Ponzu) & 51 Vegas Special (Deep Fried special that Eddie created for I Love Sushi and it's not on his menu but ask for it because its 10x better at Spicy)",

It's on Eastern Avenue, a street ubiquitous with sushi restaurants, but this is my personal favorite. The staff is always courteous and efficient. The decor is pleasant with dark wood furniture, paper lanterns, and dim lighting.  The tables by the walls are divided with partitions, so there's a sense of intimacy. There's a U-Shaped bar in the center. Their menu is large with 40+ rolls, salads, soups, ramen, udon, main entrees, sides, and desserts. It will take a while to read. My favorite rolls are the Justin Special and D Guy's special.   The Justin Special is a unique but refreshing roll--imitation crab meat enclosed by a gorgeous sliced salmon topped with fresh avocado, red onion, tomatoes, and soy sauce--is divine and healthy (except the sodium). On the glutinous side is the D Guy's special. It's gorgeous to the eye and orgasmic for my mind. My favorite \"cheat meal\", by far. I always dread that the owners might have an epiphany to edit their massive menu and eliminate these rolls, and I'm happy to report it has not happened yet. My ardor for this place can be traced back to my initial visit, and that enthusiasm is still alive today.",

We sat right away and ordered immediately. No \"all you can eat\" but that's not why we came. You might want to go to Sushi-Mon (on Maryland Pkwy) or Yama Sushi (on Flamingo Rd) if you want \"that.\" When I say \"that,\" I mean a little more rice and little less seafood in the serving; notice that they never have sashimi on the AYCE menu?  So here we had Cajun Albacore (nigiri), Spicy California roll, Spicy Yellowtail, Spicy Tuna Roll, Masago Roll with Quail egg and a Ryan Special.  Delicious. Afterwards, we were given a little bowl of fresh cut orange to round out our palette. You need to eat sushi here if your a fan of fresh seafood, a clean environment and friendly staff. Prices are decent too. Not that inflated amount you would pay if you dined at a hotel sushi restaurant.  Eddie served us and was attentive, knowledgeable, and funny. Did I mention he's the owner? (I can respect an owner involved and invested in his craft, especially when he's good at what he does.)  I asked him what day(s) of the week he gets fresh fish. He said \"every day!\"  He wasn't exaggerating because you can really taste it in the flavor and texture of his products. Give it a shot, this is one of Las Vegas's (Henderson) sure bets!",

It's a good atmosphere, for sure, but the sushi chefs make the scene. Some of them are just downright hilarious, and they sure seem to work together well. The Salmon is exceptional and the sushi is very high grade. Prices are standard, the roll list is anything but.  FAVORITE ROLL EVER: The Thing Roll with Carrot on top This roll is exceptional. It's a soft shell crab roll with loads of fixins, topped with fried shredded carrot (instead of the mushroom straws they put on the standard Thing.) It has it's own special sauce that's kinda spicy and definitely sweet. MMMMMM!!! It's a BIG roll, especially with the pile of carrots on it.",

    "text": "This review only covers my visit yesterday at lunchtime when I ordered nigiri a la carte, but I was very happy with my experience.  I was very surprised to see how large this restaurant is when I walked in - I expected it to be a narrow place but it is huge, and the sushi bar itself is the restaurant centerpiece and must seat like 30??  A few diners were trickling out when I arrived, but I came at 1:30 on a Wednesday so I wasn't expecting a wild crowd.  I sat at the bar in front of Chef Han, who was very personable.  We chatted about all sorts of things like travel and food while I leisurely sat and ate.  I got hot green tea which was exactly what I needed getting over my cold and with the weather changing.  I ordered salmon, mackerel, and whole scallop nigiri.  The seafood was very fresh and the cuts were generous.  The mackerel was perfectly cured.  There was less rice than I prefer but I know some people would like that.  Lastly, I ordered a yellowtail scallion handroll but ended up with a cut roll.  I decided to just take it because I think in the end I got a lot more of the yellowtail-scallion than I would have with a handroll anyway, and it was really quite fatty and delicious.  I was full from that, but Chef Han offered me orange with plum wine.  I never eat the oranges but my sister-in-law is a doctor and told me to drink OJ when I was sick, so this was the next best thing (plum wine makes it all better)!  I enjoyed another cup of hot tea while chatting with the chef before heading out to Trader Joe's next door.  This was a nice, quiet lunch experience with decent sushi, so I probably would pop in here again.  They are known for rolls but I think the nigiri is worth returning for again.  No AYCE here in case you are curious.",

Not only that, no refill for our teas or even asked if we wanted refills. I would have ordered another beer for my meal but no server was around to ask after we got the tab.

When my husband and I went the first time we didn't have a problem.    We went a 2nd time with another couple and the waitress had no clue and was very confused with simple orders.  It took some time trying to get her to understand what we wanted (which wasn't complicated at all!).  We all enjoyed the food.  The 3rd time we went with 2 other couples it was a horror show.  A total circus.  Everything got screwed up.  Had the same waitress that couldn't understand us and got the order wrong.  I didn't get soup with my dinner special, my friend didn't get what was supposed to be included with the dinner special (just the main dish), others issues also.  When we left they actually gave my friend the tab and he gave them his card and got the card back with a receipt but no place to sign. He thought that weird.    The ladies went to the restroom and the guys went outside.  We were stopped on the way out telling us we didn't pay!  What ended up happening is they never ran the tab even though they gave him a receipt.  We couldn't believe it.    I'll probably go back with just my husband (and pray we don't get the same waitress!) because the food was good but will never bring anyone else again.  I've recommended the restaurant twice and twice was embarrassed because the service was bad.  If we have issues again, that will be the last time we go back.  Before we left, we did get a great dessert on the house because of the mess up which was nice of them.  The dessert was very good and will probably order it again!",

Because we were sitting with friends, only a booth would do.  Booths create fellowship.  Sitting shoulder to shoulder in a row at a bar does not facilitate that.  Our server was with smile and shared with the group his favorites including one not on the menu (see tips).  As for the sushi it was fresh and delicious.

I like the place for great sushi and a drink but when I really hungry for sushi I head to Inaka.  More bang for my buck but not the bling or style .",

Some of my favorite things to order there are the Hooter's Special, Chad special,  Yum yum handroll,Princess Deana, and Bam Bam special, but you cant really go wrong with anything on their sushi menu. I Love Sushi used to be my fave, then I tried Spicy Tuna and haven't looked back. Also, if you eat here often, the staff will start to recognize you each time you come in. Whenever I walk in, they all cheer \"Sammy, Sammy!\" Do yourself a favor, and try Spicy Tuna. You certainly won't regret it.",

I literally stuff myself until I can't move and then get green tea ice cream to top it off. Not only is every thing fresh, the prices are absolutely reasonable, and the staff is always on point! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone... Best sushi spot, hands down!",

    "text": "The service was friendly and funny. The food was good as well. I ordered the Hamachi Kama and was burned -1 star and they tried to mask the flavor with lemon. They did this also to the Saba. Fresh fish really doesn't need lemon. I ordered Salmon Skin cut roll It was ok ... Not the best but not bad either ... nothing was standing out for me ... i didn't even bother to take photo's the place. The lighting was poor music too loud and bunch of plasma screens to watch sports. My wife order tempura and Udon. It was ok. I tried my sons chicken it was quite good. I ordered the a roll d's something it was really good. This place is more like fusion maki sushi ... if you like fusion maki sushi you need to come here. If they didn't burn my hamachi kama would be a 4 Star. The service is good, food is good, but when i got my bill ... it wasn't that good. Give it a try ... i will come back in a month and try it again.",

    "text": "What to say...I used to go to I love sushi all the time until my friend brought me to spicy tuna! Best sushi of my life!!! I go there once a week or even twice I've tried many sushi restaurants before but none of them have the service, food and overall atmosphere spicy tuna has! Eddi is amazing, very friendly and prompt wt my order he always starts me off with the complimentary cucumber salad and edamame, I always order the double d roll which is my favorite and he makes the exception to make it mild for me since I don't like my food spicy, Ryan roll and the crunchbug is good as well and at the end they always finish off with a complimentary orange or icecream for the price it's so worth it!....everyone there is very friendly and funny as well, unfortunately I moved to LA so I don't get to eat there as often u can even imagine how many times I've craved their sushi! Every time I'm in vegas I make time to visit and enjoy some real sushi!  Always and forever ur faithful customer aka miss double d!",

    "text": "Blah. Went there for lunch and it seemed it was all about cutting costs and saving money. Lunch special was full of upcharges...just charge a dollar more for the special to begin with instead of having the little note that says this and that and the other will cost you a dollar more. A sashimi platter would be nice as well. The spicy tuna roll was good but the rest just seemed like fluff. A potsticker that was chewy and a spring roll that was laden with grease. Perhaps it was just an off day with the food, but the menu could use some revamping.",

Anywho, we ordered the crispy roll and D's guys something... They tasted pretty good. But I'm giving them a 3 out of 5 stars because the chefs were annoying during our dinner.   We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs kept peeking over and basically just watched us eat. One kept talking to us making it pretty difficult to carry out our own conversation. But once he started talking, along comes the owner, the host, and a chef who's on his day off. I wouldn't go back, unless it's during the day during peak hours.",
